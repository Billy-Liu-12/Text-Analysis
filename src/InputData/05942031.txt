A Novel Approach to Prune Mined Association Rules in Large Databases

Abstract ? Association rule mining finds interesting associations and/or correlation relationships among large set of data items. Association rules shows attribute value conditions that occur frequently together in a given dataset. However, the usefulness of association rules is strongly limited by the huge amount of delivered rules. It is crucial to help the decision- maker with an efficient postprocessing step in order to select interesting association rules throughout huge volumes of discovered rules. This motivates the need for association analysis. This paper presents a survey of different association rule mining techniques for market basket analysis, highlighting strengths of different association rule mining techniques.  Further, we want to point out potential pitfalls as well as challenging issues need to be addressed by an association rule mining technique. We believe that the results of this evaluation will help decision maker for making important decisions.

I. INTRODUCTION  Association rule mining is considered as one of the most important tasks in Knowledge Discovery in Databases. An association rule is defined as the implication X => Y, described by two interestingness measures-support and confidence-where X and Y are the sets of items. Furthermore, valuable information is often represented by those rare-low support and unexpected association rules which are surprising to the user. So, the more we increase the support threshold, the more efficient the algorithms are and the more the discovered rules are obvious, and hence, the less they are interesting for the user. As a result, it is necessary to bring the support threshold low enough in order to extract valuable information. Unfortunately, the lower the support is, the larger the volume of rules becomes, making it intractable for a decision-maker to analyze the mining result. Experiments show that rules become almost impossible to use when the number of rules overpasses 100. Thus, it is crucial to help the decision maker with an efficient technique for reducing the number of rules.

In this paper, a fairly comprehensive comparison of various association rule mining techniques is presented.

We analyzed the performance and the efficiency of different association mining approaches. Also this paper discusses the level of interestingness each technique provides. Rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II contains a generalized summary of various association mining techniques and brief description of different approaches that have been taken for study. Section III gives a comparative analysis of various association mining techniques based on certain parameters.



II. METHODOLOGY FOR ASSOCIATION RULE GENERATION  Association analysis has wide range of applications in market basket analysis, Intrusion detection, bioinformatics, web usage mining. There have been several such association mining techniques for generating association rules. The concise representation of frequent itemset as proposed by Burdick [2] and optimal rule discovery as proposed by Li [3], Zaki [4] introduced concise representation of frequent itemset to reduce the number of frequent itemsets and CLOSET algorithm was proposed [5] as a new efficient method for mining closed itemsets. Another solution for the reduction of the number of frequent itemsets is mining maximal frequent itemsets [6]. MAFIA algorithm is based on depth-first traversal and several pruning methods. More recently, Bellandi [7] proposed ontology driven association rule extraction.The different approaches for the redundancy reduction of association rules are: Zaki and Hsiao used frequent closed itemsets in the CHARM algorithm [8] in order to generate all frequent closed itemsets. They used an itemset-tid set search tree and pursued with the aim of generating a small nonredundant rule set [9]. To this goal, the authors first found minimal generator for closed itemsets, and then, they generated nonredundant association rules using two closed itemsets.

Pasquier et al. [10] proposed the Close algorithm in order to extract association rules. Close algorithm is based on a new mining method: pruning of the closed set lattice (closed itemset lattice) in order to extract frequent closed itemsets. Association rules are generated starting from frequent itemsets generated from frequent closed itemsets.

As proposed in [11],choosing the right objective measure is an important factor to be considered. [12]A. Silberschatz and A. Tuzhilin proposed an approach about the interestingness pattern. From the above association rule mining techniques, few are selectively analyzed in detail in this literature.

A. CLOSET: an Efficient Algorithm for mining Frequent closed Itemsets  This approach is an efficient algorithm for mining frequent itemsets with the development of three techniques: (i) Applying compressed, frequent pattern tree FP-tree structure for mining closed itemsets without candidate generation.

(ii) Developing a single prefix path compression technique to identify frequent closed itemsets quickly.

(iii) Exploring a partition based projection mechanism for scalable mining in large databases.

___________________________________                              Optimization1: Compress transactional and conditional databases using an FP-tree structure: Optimization2: Extract items appearing in every transaction of conditional database:    Fig.1. Directly Extract frequent closed itemsets from FP tree  Fig.1. shows how the frequent closed itemsets can be extracted directly from FP tree. This reduces the size of FP- tree because the conditional databases contain less number of items after extraction and also reduces the level of recursion.

Optimization3: Directly extract frequent itemsets from FP-tree:  ? This allows the program to identify frequent closed itemsets quickly.

? Reduces the size of remaining FP tree to be examined.

? Reduces the level of recursion.

Optimization4: Prune search branches   B.  Ontology-Driven Association Rule Extraction This provides an integrated framework for extracting  constraint-based Multi-level Association Rules with an ontology support. This method can improve the quality of filtered rules.

The System Architecture as shown in Fig.2 presents a view of set of components in the Ontology-Driven rule extraction. The ontology (OD) describes the domain of interest (D) and it is used as a means of meta-data representation. The interpretation module translates the requests of a user (user constraints) into a set of formal constrains (QD defined on OD) so that they can be supplied to the Ontology Query Engine by means of a suitable query language.

Fig.2. System Architecture  There are several ways to reduce the computational complexity of Association Rule Mining and to increase the quality of the extracted rules: (i) reducing the search space; (ii) exploiting efficient data structures; (iii) adopting domain-specific constraints. The first two classes of optimizations are used for reducing the number of steps of the algorithm, for re-organizing the itemsets, for encoding the items, and for organizing the transactions in order to minimize the algorithm time complexity. The third class tries to overcome the lack of user data-exploration by handling domain-specific constraints.

This paper focuses on these optimizations by representing a specific domain by means of ontology and driving the extraction of association rules by expressing constraints. The aim of this work is to reduce the ?search space? of the algorithm and to improve the significance of the association rules.

C. Selecting the Right Objective Measure for Association Analysis This approach describe several key properties one should  examine in order to select the right measure for a given application. An algorithm is presented for selecting a small set of patterns such that domain experts can find a measure that best fits their requirements by ranking this small set of patterns. This approach describe several key properties one should examine in order to select the right measure for a given application.

The specific contributions are: 1) An overview of 21 objective measures is discussed in the statistics, social science, machine learning, and data mining literature. It is shown that application of different measures may lead to substantially differing orderings of patterns.

2) Several key properties are proposed that will help analysts to select the right measure for a given application.

A comparative study of these properties is made using the twenty-one existing measures. Our results suggest that we can identify several groups of consistent measures having similar properties.

3) This also illustrates two situations in which most of the measures become consistent with each other, namely, when support-based pruning and a technique known as table standardization are used. This method also demonstrates the                   utility of support-based pruning in terms of eliminating uncorrelated and poorly correlated patterns.

4) An algorithm is used for selecting a small set of tables such that domain experts can determine the most suitable measure by looking at their rankings for this small set of tables.

D. An Approach to Facilitate the Analysis of the Association Rules  The goal of the research presented in this paper is to enable the end users to analyze, understand and use the extracted knowledge in an intelligent system or to support in the decision-making processes... In the paper, the GART algorithm is proposed, which uses taxonomies to generalize association rules, and the RulEE-GAR computational module, that enables the analysis of the generalized rules.

This method uses iterative taxonomy to generalize and then prunes redundant rules at each step.

During years, manual methods had been used to convert data in knowledge. However the use of these methods has become expensive, time consuming, subjective and non- viable when applied at large databases. The problems with the manual methods stimulated the development of processes of automatic analysis, like the process of Knowledge Discovery in Databases or Data Mining.

In the Data Mining process, the use of the association rules technique may generate large quantities of patterns which make it difficult for the analyst to analyze the resultant pattern. A way to solve the problem of the large quantities of patterns extracted by the association rules technique is the use of taxonomies in the step of post- processing Knowledge. The taxonomies may be used to prune uninteresting and/or redundant rules. In this paper the GART algorithm and the RulEE-GAR computational module is proposed. The GART algorithm (Generalization of Association Rules using Taxonomies) uses taxonomies to generalize association rules. The RulEEGAR computational module uses the GART algorithm, to generalize association rules, and provides several means to analyze the generalized rules. The RulEE-GAR computational module that provides means to generalize association rules and also to analyze the generalized rules. The screen of the interface enables the user to analyze and to explore the generalized rules sets.

E. An Efficient and Interactive Postmining of Association Rules In Data Mining, the usefulness of association rules is  strongly limited by the huge amount of delivered rules. To overcome this drawback, several methods were proposed in the literature such as itemset concise representations, redundancy reduction, and postprocessing. However, being generally based on statistical information, most of these methods do not guarantee that the extracted rules are interesting for the user. Thus, it is crucial to help the decision-maker with an efficient postprocessing step in order to reduce the number of rules.

This paper proposes a new interactive approach to prune and filter discovered rules. First, ontologies are proposed in  order to improve the integration of user knowledge in the postprocessing task. Secondly, Rule Schema formalism specification is used for user expectations. Furthermore, an interactive framework is designed to assist the user throughout the analyzing task as shown in Fig.3  As the approach proposed in [1], the method contains two main parts. First, the knowledge base allows formalizing user knowledge and goals. Domain knowledge offers a general view over user knowledge in database domain, and user expectations express the prior user knowledge over the discovered rules. Second, the postprocessing task consists in applying iteratively a set of filters over extracted rules in order to extract interesting rules: minimum improvement constraint filter, item-relatedness filter, rule schema filters/pruning.

III. ANALYSIS OF ASSOCIATION RULE MININGTECHNIQUE   Parameters used for Comparison The main parameters we considered for the analysis of  different association rule mining approaches are scalability, quality of filtered rules, user interesting criteria.

Efficiency and Scalability have always been important concerns in the field of data mining, and are even more so in the multi-relational context, which is inherently more complex. The issue has been receiving an increasing amount of attention during the last few years, and quite a number of theoretical results, algorithms and implementations have been presented that explicitly aim at improving the efficiency and Scalability of multi-relational data mining approaches. Table1 shows the comparison of different association rule mining approaches.

Scalability: The system should be scalable with increase in amount of information.

User Interestingness Criteria: This depends on strong interaction with the user.

The comparison of different association rule mining approach is given in Table 1. CLOSET is an efficient algorithm for mining frequent closed itemset.

Comparison Table  Parameters 2.1   2.2   2.3 2.4 Proposed Approach                                                              Scalability     Yes     Yes     Yes   Yes Yes  User Interesting  criteria No No No No Yes  Quality No Yes No No Yes    A. Merits of CLOSET efficient algorithm: 1) Number of frequent items can be reduced.

2) Search space can be reduced.

B. DeMerits of CLOSET efficient algorithm: This approach is based on statistical information and does not guarantee the rules are   interesting for the user. There is no interactive approach to capture user interesting pattern.

C. Merits of Ontology Driven Rule extraction method: The main advantages of the proposed framework can be summarized in terms of extensibility and flexibility.

1) The framework is extensible because data properties and concepts can be introduced in the ontology without either changing the relational database containing the transaction, or the implementation of our framework.

2) The flexibility is guaranteed from the separation of the data to analyze (the transactions) from the meta-data (description of the data).

D. Demerits of Ontology Driven Rule extraction method: 1) The overhead in conducting pruning tests and as a result the execution time is high.

2) This paper uses seRQL to express user knowledge which is not as flexible as rule schema.

E. Merits of Taxonomy in Association Analysis Method: 1) Efficient approach to prune and generalize association rules.

2) Good approach to analyze the rules generation.

F. Demerits of Taxonomy in Association Analysis Method: 1) This method uses iterative taxonomy in order to  generalize and then prune redundant rules at each step which results in more number of iterations.

G. Merits and Demerits of objective measure selection method: This paper describe several key properties one should  examine in order to select the right measure for a given application. Objective measure is restricted only for data evaluation not sufficient to reduce number of rules and to capture interesting one.

H.   An Efficient and Interactive Post mining of Association Rules (Proposed Approach) The proposed approach is composed of two main phases.

The first phase includes the generation of support counts of item sets at each timeslot and candidate item sets. The second phase involves mining of association rules from candidate items and post mining of association rules using ontology and user constraint template to guarantee user interesting rules as shown in Fig 4.

Demerits of proposed method: 1) The task of mapping ontology concepts with the  DB items is time consuming

IV.EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION  Generating Association rules: Association rule mining finds interesting associations  and/or correlation relationships among large set of data items.

Association rules shows attribute value conditions that occur frequently together in a given dataset.

In order to target the most interesting rules, I fix a minimum support of 2 percent, a maximum support of 30 percent, and a minimum confidence of 80 percent for the association rules mining process. Among available algorithms, We use the Apriori algorithm in order to extract association rules. The generated association rules describe the relationship between attribute.

Steps of frequent item set and association rule generation: 1. Scan the database to calculate the support of each item  set.

2.  Add the item set to frequent item set if support is  greater than or equal to min_support.

3. At each level divide each of the frequent items set into  left hand side and right hand side.

4. Calculate the confidence of each rule that is generated.

5. Generate strong rules satisfying min_support and min_confidence.

The rule A=>B holds in the transaction set D with support s, where s is the percentage of transaction in D that contain AUB.The rule has confidence c in the transaction set D if c is the percentage of transactions in D containing A that also contains B  Support (A=>B) =P (AUB)                                              (1)  Confidence (A=>B) =P (B/A)                                          (2)  Table 2 shows the comparison of number of interesting rules selected when matching operator is applied over user- constraint template and when not applied.

IV. CONCLUSION  This paper discusses the problem of selecting interesting association rules through huge volumes of discovered rules.

This motivates the need for association analysis  This paper presents the analysis of different association rule mining techniques for market basket analysis, highlighting strengths of different approaches. Further the potential pitfalls as well as challenging issues need to be addressed by an association rule mining technique are also discussed. We believe that the results of this evaluation will help decision maker for making important decisions. We have evaluated the algorithms based on parameters like scalability, quality of filtered rules. Our evaluation shows that interactive postmining process should be efficient and produce user interesting rules.
