Abstract: In this paper, the net-making clustering method  was used to analysis the data of the Zhengzhou Commodity  Exchange futures price of sugar, the Nanning market spot  price, the London Commodity Exchange futures price of  sugar , the India market spot price inthe first quarter of  2012 ,and got the conclusion that the classification of the spot market for home and abroadwhich distinguish the different degrees of price change was reasonable. And to the futures  markets at home and abroad, the effect of the classification  was not obvious, and the futures price change was relatively  stable.

Key words : net-making clustering analysis , spot price ,  futures price, the price of sugar  1. INTRODUCTION Sugar has a significant effect to our country agricultural  commodity. At present, China's sugar industry presents a series of features, such as the growing demand, the fluctuation of the price constantly and the high import. Since 2009, the domestic and international sugar spot prices have been rising for three consecutive years, the domestic spot price has gone up to 7800 yuan/tons in 2011 which was 3000 yuan/tons in 2009. The international price has also risen up to more than 30 cents per pound in 20 II from 12.94 cents per pound in 2009. In the first half of 20 11, the domestic price appeared two wheel obvious rise. In August, the domestic sugar average price rose up to 7667 yuan/ton, and got the highest price of the year. In September, the domestic sugar market gradually entered the off-season, and the international price also increasingly ease. Then with new would start, the domestic price fell to the bottom of the year.

With the development of economy and industry, the price trend at home and abroad has been found consistent with each other, and the price fluctuation was constantly[1].There were four reasons for the rise of sugar price in 2010/2011 : the first was the lack of sugar production; the second was the high international price; the third was the high sugar production costs and the last one was that the overall price level has risen [2]. Thus it can be seen, the mutual relationship of the spot market price at home and abroad was increasingly close.

In addition to the spot market, the futures market at home and abroad was also worth discussing. Liang Quanxi [3] discussed the relationship between the domestic futures market and the spot market, and drew the conclusion that the futures price and spot price was long-term balanced. Xu xin etc [4] done the research about the futures market in China and USA, and found that the discovery function of the sugar   Chen Ru-kai* Sugarcane Institute of Research Inc.

Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University Fuzhou, China  fafu948@126.com  futures market was preliminary already appear , but there was a large gap between China and the USA. Gordon GemmMS] do the research of the American sugar policy long-term effect, the research method is use the world sugar economic local equilibrium model. The article mainly involved the United States in 1974, the sugar act of international free trade and unilateral free trade and international sugar exporter agreement. The research results show that domestic producers legislation for producers of the actual effect is far lower than expected. Koo and Taylor [6] simulated the development trend of the world sugar market, use the analysis method to evaluate the production, consumption and inventory, and use the world sugar policy simulation model to simulates the 20009-20 I 0 the world sugar market price. The research results show that the world sugar trade will increase 4.6%, and sugar prices in 2010 than in 2000 will be increased to 4-12.67 cents. Elobeid and Amani, etcP] use the local equilibrium models to analyze the trade liberalization, eliminate the world sugar market consumption behavior such as distortion effects. The research results show that: if eliminate the trade distortion, the international sugar prices will rise 27% in 2012; If eliminate trade and production distortion, the international market price will be increased by 48% more than in 2002.

Devadoss and Krop [8] use the space equilibrium model to evaluate the influence of the agricultural negotiations in Uruguay. The research results show that the changes of the Uruguay policy will affect the domestic price of sugar and sugar consumption. Haley9]use the sugar base width scheme model to study the American free trade area (FT AA) for American sugar production , the marketing and the influence of the price. The research results show that sugar industry increasingly open, import tariffs and quotas are likely to improve the domestic sugar industry, at the same time, the FT AA threat the United States sugar production area to improve efficiency.

Previous research about the sugar price always use the comparision of the data, and use the models ,such as the general equilibrium model to get the conclusion. This paper based on the clustering analysis, make use of the data of Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange sugar price, Nanning spot market price, London Commodity Exchange sugar price, India spot market price in first quarter of 20 12, analysis the change rule of four market, determine whether the market price can be classified, and analyze the price changes of the four market.

IT. RESEARCH METHODS AND DATA SOURCES  A Research method Clustering analysis [10] was a kind of mathematical  method according to certain required to classifY things. Its basic principle was based on the sample attribute or feature, using mathematical method to determine quantitatively between samples affinity-diaphaneity relationship, and made classification, finally got a classification system which can reflect the individual affinity-diaphaneity relationship. In order to make it more practical, the fuzzy mathematics principle was introduced and the net fuzzy clustering analysis method was choosed in this paper. And the Matlab software was used to get the conclusion.

Net fuzzy clustering model principle was: after establishing the fuzzy similar matrix, selected A and do  cutting matrix RJ. .Mark sample number in the diagonal  position of the cutting matrix RJ., in diagonal below use * instead of 1 , use Spaces instead of 0. The * position called node, from node to diagonal lead jig (meridian) and horizontal line (parallel). The "net" is to put each sample link up through the warp and weft, whoever can be tied were the same kind, so as to realize the classification B Data sources  As the domestic market representative, use Zheng represent Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange sugar price, use Nann represent Nanning market spot price; As a foreign market representative, use Lund represent London Commodity Exchange sugar price, use Inda represent India market spot price. Data sorting from the international market main commodity import cost price and the domestic market price monitoring weekly from Commerce Department, its time from 2011.12.26 to 2012.4.6. If there were data loss, use the linear interpolation method to perfect.

m. MODEL ESTABLISHMENT AND ANALYSTS A Establish the fuzzy similar matrix  Use the Hierarchical Cluster method when the classification is not clear. The basic step as described below:  1) Use digital describe the characteristics of samples.

Establish classification of sample set X = {XI' x2,'" xn} , of which each elementxi called sample. Each sample had m  factors,that wasxi = {Xii ' Xi2 , ? ? ?  xim }, i = 1 ? . .  n .

2) The original data standardization processing. In order  to eliminate effect of various dimensional of different variable, made use of the formula  , Xik - xk . 1 k 1 X ik = ,1 = . . .  n, = . . .  m . (1 ) (J'k Among (1), Xik was the value of the ith samples kth  factor, xk was the mean value of the kth factor series,  (J' k was the mean-square deviation of the kth factor series.

Through standardized treatment, the mean value of the new sequence was 0, the variance was 1.

3) Use the correlation coefficient method to calculate fuzzy similar relation, its formula was   In  ?:CXik - xJ? (X/k - xJ k=1 In In  ?:CXik - Xi)2 . L(X/k -XJ)2 k=1 k=1 1 In 1 In  Among (2), Xi = - LXik, XJ = - LX/k m k=l m k=l  If ru appeared negative, use formula(3)  r' =  rlj + 1 lJ 2  to adj ust.

D Analysis o{the results  By that A = 0.9877, the sugar market weeks price at home and abroad could mainly be divided into two classes.

Consider the standard deviation before and after the data classification.

TABLE 1 STANDARD DERTV ATTON CONSTRAST TABLE  Inda Nann Lund Zheng All data 15.47 79.70 20.35 62.95 standard deviation The first kind 4.98 98.99 23.54 60.78 o/data standard deviation The second 10.64 40.63 19.40 53.98 kind o/data standard deviation  The following result can be got by contrasting the data of Table 1:  For India spot market, the standard deviation of each kind compared smaller after classification. That means the dispersion degree becomes smaller. The phenomenon explained that sugar spot price changes little from late December 2011 to the middle of January. And from the middle of January. because the weak dollar and the sugar production in India was greatly lower than expected, and the third largest international sugar exporter Australia were   MoB1.15  affected by heavy rains, the international sugar price rose.

From November 2010 to February 2011, as shown in figure 2, the international spot market price rose sharply, and broke through the 30 years record in early February 2011. Then affected by the consumption, the international sugar price began to plunge. To march, the price began to bounce back.

Therefore, the classification divided the time quantum into two parts in which sugar price showed rising and falling trend , thus got a better evaluation.

Figure 2 India market spot price  For Nanning market spot price, the standard deviation of the first kind data compared bigger to the overall data, the second kind compared smaller. The dispersion degree of the first kind was compared bigger, the second kind was smaller.

In late December 2011 to the middle of January and march, as shown in figure 3 , the sugar price fell gradually because of the favorable national policy and the rich production. In March, sugar prices overall in the shock stage, the sugar price basicly be a smooth down trend in the first half, and show slowly rising trend in the second half. The reasons of the fluctuation of spot price was that the main region gradually enter into the open squeeze peak, and the market supply was abundant. The spot market supply exceeded demand. To March, sugar prices overall in shock trimming.

In late January until February, the rise range of the sugar price was not big, the spot price changes remained relatively stable. Therefore, the February in which the sugar price change smoothly was divided out.

As shown in figure 4, in late December 2011 to the middle ofJanuary, the main agency consensus forecasts the global production in main countries would increase dramatically. However in February, because of the disaster weather, the production was expected to cut, and then, production was expected to began to constantly adjust. The international industry organization (ISO) made the basic supply and demand balanced in 2010/11 . To the end of march, the good weather conditions of Brazil, India and Thailand etc made sugar production prospects better than expected. At the end of December 2011 to the middle of  January and in the march of 2012, the sugar price went down instead of up. The change degree became opposite bigger.

And at the end of January to February, the sugar price change relatively small due to the supply and demand.

Figure 4 London Commodity Exchange futures price of sugar  For Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange sugar price, the dispersion degree of these two kind of data all become smaller after classification . As shown in figure 5, in order to digest the agricultural futures market policy issued in the middle of November, the sugar prices began to drop dramatically. And in late January and early February, the futures price showed rapid rising trend because the domestic spot price rose. In late January until February, the spot price remains relatively stable, which led to the relatively stable futures price. In march, by the double effect of the domestic spot price and futures price, the sugar futures prices of the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange rose  slightly.

IV. CONCLUSION  MoB1.15  Through the above analysis, the following conclusion is: F or India spot market and Nanning spot market, the  classification is reasonable because the price fluctuation degree can be classified clearly. At the same time, it can be found that the spot market price change is bigger. For the domestic spot market, the production were less than expected due to the rising sugar consumption and the  weather. Our country store sugar collection. storage auction,  sugar imported, and even serious smuggling import sugar and so on, are greatly affected the domestic sugar price, and lead to the fluctuation of the sugar prices fluctuate. For the abroad spot market, the global natural disasters occurred frequently and the production declined obviously in the global main sugar countries in nearly three would. And the estimation of sugar price refresh 30 years historical highs. At the same time, the international sugar price shock greatly because of the dollar weak trend, as well as the global sugar market is in a large surplus of supply under the background of transition.

For London Commodity Exchange and Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange sugar price, the classification dispersion degree change is not obviously, which shows that  the change of thesugar price in and abroad are relatively stable. Because of the integration process of development, the main sugar futures market prices influence each other gradually. It also accord with the conclusion of XuXin [4] that the spot price of domestic and foreign period have the  long-term equilibrium relationship. it is easily found that as the world's major sugar production, consumption and importers, the correlation between Chinese sugar price and the international sugar price is very strong, and the change trend of the domestic sugar futures price and the international sugar price is more and more consistent.
