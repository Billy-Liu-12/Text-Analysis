I.  INTRODUCTION With product life cycles shortening,information technology  and the rapid development of knowledge economy, and customer gradually increasing expectations,the competition among enterprises are gradually entering supply chain competition.In the market competition of global economy integration ?big and complete? enterprise is disintegrating gradually, the relation among enterprises present the obvious network tendency day by day, supply chain management (SCM)obtain universal application in the Manufacturing enterprises, becomes one kind of new management pattern[1] In the supply chain management, the thing that carrying on the reasonable appraisal and the choice to the supplier,would get supply chain cost reduction,response speed acceleration and efficiency enhancement,as well as enhancement of product and service quality,then satisfy  customer requirement[2].

Supplier achievements evaluation and choice is one of important contents in supply chain design,which can respond  the supply chain efficiency and benefit and the difference with competitor effectively.For our country SCM is being at the start stage, further research is not enough to its theory and method and the content of choosing and evaluating suppliers to be less. Now,the problem has been furrther studied by many literatures  The domestic and foreign literature have conducted thorough research from many aspects to the supplier evaluation and the choice research question,theory and method, proposed different assessment method[3]-[4].These literature mainly concentrate on the strategy level of supply chain design and the performance appraisal ,and which result only plays certain guiding role for the business management,without being one kind of policy-making tool truly. Although the quantitative research have already carried out deeply, but the choice of supplier most is depending on the experience, and lacking the scientifically rational appraisal system and menthod. Many research,which isn?t based on supply chain foundation,couldnot adapt the supplier appraisal under the supply chain environment[5]. so the study of supplier evaluation own theory and practical significance.



II. SUPPLY CHAIN SUPPLIER EVALUATION MODEL AND CALCULATION PROCESS  A. The Principle of Analysis of Principal Component The processes of principle of analysis of the principal  component are as follows:  1) Date standardization.

Different evaluation courses different dimension,the large  difference results in the difficulties of competition in each standard?s function. Suppose there is n waiting evaluated sample, and with p waiting evaluated standard in every sample.X??(?=1,2,?,?;?=1,2,?,?) is the I ed sample and J ed evaluated standard.The standardized calculate formula  is : ),,2,1;,2,1( pjni  S ZZ  X J  jij ij ==  ? = ?  .

2) Achieving the Relevant Quotiety Matrix R though Standardized Date  ?=(?ij)???  of  which      1 1    )()(  ))((  ? ?  ?  = =  =  ??  ?? =  n  k  n  k jkjiki  n  k jkjiki  ij  xxxx  xxxx r  (?=1,2,?,?;? =1,2,?,?).

3) Relevant QuotietyMatrixCharacter  ? and Eigenvector L  Ask the characteristic value of the matrix of the coefficient correlation  ??(?=1,2,?,?), write and do,?1??2????????0, the corresponding characteristic vector quantity tried to get at the same time is ??=(??1,??2,?,???)?,?=1,2,?,?  4) Calculating thePrincipal Component to Score Cost The score of the i sample in p principal composition  directions is worth??1,??2,????           i  i  i  i  pppp  p  p  ip  i  i  x x x x  Z  Z Z  ???  ??? ???  =  (?=1,2,?,?)  5) Calculating the Principal Component Score Cos The principal component of the i  sample, ),,2,1(   niZfF ij p  j ji =?= ?  = ,In the type,?? is the proportion of the total amount of information of initial data  of the composition that the j is principal, namely, ?= = p  i i  j jf  ?  ?  ( ? =1,2,?, ? ),The stable order of the sample should be arranged from the bigness to smallness[5]-[6]  B. The Fisher Theory The processes of the best division theory suppose the  ordered sample are X?1??X?2?,?,X?N?,?X?i?m are vectors?  1)  Defined Diameter Suppose G includes the sample:{X ? i ? ,X ? i+1 ?  ,?,X(j)}  (j>i),and do ,G = {i,i+1,?,j}? the mean value  vector quantity of this kind GX  is  ?=+? =  j  it tG Xij  X )(1   With D(i,j)express the diameter of this kind, the commonly used diameter is as  follows, )()(),( )(  ' )( Gt  j  it Gt XXXXjiD ??= ?  =  When m  =1,can also define the diameter ?  =  ?= j  jt Gt XXjiD  ~),( )(   of which, GX ~  is a median of this kind of datum  2)  The Loss Function of Defined Classify With b (n , k) express divide n samples in order into k kinds  of a certain methods?often keeping score means  b (n , k) is :G1 = {i1, i1+1,?, i2-1}?G2 ={i2, i2+1,?, i3-1}, ??,GK ={ik, ik+1,?, n},of which divide and click is 1 = i1 < i2 < i3 < ? < ik < n = ik+1?1?namely i k+1 = n+1?.

The loss function of defining this kind of classification is  ? =  + ?= k  t tt iiDknbL  1 )1,()],([  ,when n,k are stable, [ ]),( knbL  small to show all kinds of square and little from  difference , it is rational to classify. So should look for a kind of method b (n,k) , enable separating and losing function L to reach minimumly.Write P (n,k) make (3) Reach extremely small classification .

3)  Detrude Formula of [ ]),( knbL The most central part of fisher algorithm is to utilize two  following recurrence  formulae: { }),()1,1(min)]2,([  njDjDnPL  nj +?=  ?? , { }),()]1,1([min)],([ njDkjPLknpL  njk +??  ?? .It is provable that the above-mentioned two formulae are defined, (4)Two type indicate want it if letting, have n pieces of sample divided into k the optimum to cut apart, should set up here on the basis of cutting apart j - 1 samples into k-1 kind optimumly(j =2,3, ?,n).

4)  Finding the Answer of Best Answer If classify count k?1<k<n?is known, ask classification  means P (n,k ), make it lose the function meaning to assign minimum, it asking means as follows:  Firstly, look for and divide clicking j k,make(4) extremely be small to reach, promptly, L [P?n , k ?] = L[P( j k-1, k-1 )] + D ( j k , n ) .Take K type GK ={j k, j k + 1 , ?,n },Then look for j k-1 to make it satisfied,L[P( j k-1, k-1 )] = L[P( j k-1 ?1 , k - 2 )] + D ( j k-1 , j k ? 1 ) .Get k -1 kind of GK-1 ={j k - 1,j k - 1 +1,?,j k - 1},The similar method can get all kinds of G1 , G2 sequentially, GK, this is that we want what has been asked is solved optimumly, namely P (n , k ) = {G1,G2,?,GK }.

In a word , in order to ask solving optimumly , mainly calculate {D?i , j?; 1 ? i<j ? n}and{L[P?i, j?]}, 1 ? i ? n , i ? j ? n }[7]-[9].



III. THE EVALUATION CASE ANALYSIS OF SUPPLY CHAIN SUPPLIERS BASED ON DATA MINING  A. Supply Chain Suppliers Index and  Data In order to assess and value supply chain supplier, this  paper scores and orders the supply chain supplier by the following guidelines:?1?transporation cost F1;?2?supply in time, F2, which express a contract fulfilled punctually, computation by late goods supply quantity;?3?maintenance service F3,which means reponse day multiply quantity repaired ;?4?arrival of goods, qualified parts quantity F4;?5?The number of times of transportation arrival on time F5;?6?the number of times of the supplier bill arrival accurately F6.

Through open information,this paper collect nine supply chain supplier data ,and then gain nine simple original data.in comprehensive evaluation index system,there be two type of index:(1)positive index,the more value the more practice    production.(2)nagative index: the more value the less practice  production. negative index: ii xx ?='  [10] .

B. The Process of Evaluation and Choice of Supply Chain Suppliers  This paper using the most popular software SAS, combining principal component and fisher analyzing method of multi-statistics analyzed, assesses nine supply chain suppliers firstly.Using S1-S9 to represent nine supply chain suppliers. Using the SAS software to analyze the original collected data.the principal component could eliminate the overlaps of the standard information and could information provided from standard, through mathematical calculation,objectively. in terms of statistics,these variables may exist high relativity,adding the complexity of the analyzing problem.So how about using a few irrelevant integrate variable to indicate the majority information is the important thing,In terms of mathematics,which is also called degradation logical thinking.[11]-[13]  The basic principle of multivariable analysis of the principal component,in order to search the information integrality, the table and fig as follows:  According to the eigenvalue and its percentages rate,which shows in table1, may select two of the principal component P1 and P2, that its percentages accumulative total can reach 81.99%, i.e. P1 and P2. The three genes reflect the information number can reach 81.99%.

According to the nine supply chain vender enterprise scoring in the principal component, judgment and comparison can be conducted on the operation condition in these enterprise.we can see, the highest score is got by enterprise S1 which stands for the enterprise S1 has the highest comprehensive ability. Followed by, enterprise S3?S6?S5? S7 and so on .the lowest comprehensive ability is S4?S8 and S9.

Now since analysing the comprehensive sequencing situation of the income on the basis of the principal component,and then utilizing fisher to carry on cluster's analysis to the enterprises.

If we can not make sure the K, then we may make out L [P ?n,k?] as the figure when k changes. This paper use GPLOT process from SAS to make out L[P ? n,k ? ] as k changes[14[[15] .See fig.1. K was determined by the curve point. From the graph and we can see K=4, considering practical situation so we conclude that four categories is better.

After analyzing the data from samples, we should divide the seven samples into three categories, i.e. K=4 From the least lost classify function, L[P?9,4?]= 0.7190?8?which means that the least loss is 0.7190 When classified, we make out the forth category G4=[X8,X9], and then do other seven samples.

When divided into three categories, we can get the least loss is  LP?7,3?=0.6260?4?,so G3=[X4,X5,X6,X7], and then do other three samples. When divided into two categories, we can  TABLE I.

The supply chain supplyier may carry on synthesis measure by using the performance evaluation model which make use of principle analysis and fisher,which is better to understand enterprise result in the supply chain operation efficiency and the effect,know about supplier performance level, and can make crosswise and the longitudinal comparison, and causes the enterprise to find problem and solve problem.which not only might understand the enterprise own achievements level, but may also understand the supply chain supplier achievements that other enterprise adopted outsourcing and provides decision-making reference for enterprise.



IV. CONCLUSIONS The choice of supply chain vendors is cruial link of supply  chain management.in practice and theory. Because the supplier is the logistics initial departure point in the entire supply chain, which is the capital flow start point, simultaneously also the information flow end point, without  the supplier to supply goods  uninterrupted quality and quantity,punctuality and highly effection,the entire supply chain link enterprises wouldnot get smooth operation.Therefore, to the the evaluation for supplier is the entire supervisory control system's beginning. This paper makes the construction of the  index system for the evaluation and analysis of supply chain supplier, and applies the principal component and fisher method to assess the supply chain vender. The method of principle component analysis could eliminate the overlaps of the  standard information and could automatically provide weight, through mathematical calculation, objectively. Adopting this method to assess supply chain supplier, it will be more simple, dependent and could order the supplier with good and bad.moreover,this method could grade them.It?s proved to be reliable and effective in practical application, and The supply chain management and the design have the vital significance to enterprise's survival and the development,supply chain design to raise the enterprise reaction rate, enterprise flexibility enhancement, to reduce costs have the very vital significance.

The supply chain design can become the enterprise superintendent decision-making tool truly. But the supplier choice and the performance appraisal management is an precisely indispensable link. this research chooses the best supplier for the Manufacturing enterprises, which have certain inspiration function to decisions-making for enlarging with cooperation scope among close partners and  providing the theory basis for supply chain design. So the model might be regarded as one of main foundations reference for decision making.
