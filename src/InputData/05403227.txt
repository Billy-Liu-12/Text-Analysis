MDA-based Modeling and Implementation of E-Commerce Web Applications in  WebML

Abstract?Nowadays E-commerce is one of the most important applications on the Internet. Since E-commerce is a data- intense and complex business processes web application, its development and maintaining is one big challenge. In this paper, we experience a high level modeling method in WebML base on MDA to implement a simplified E-commerce web application which is a PC online shopping. The experimental results show this development method can effectively simplify the development processing and maintenance with less time and cost.

I.  INTRODUCTION In the last two decades, web applications are rapidly  growing with the popularity of Internet. Early web applications are usually used to publish some simple and static information based on simply static language like HTML. Modern Web applications are more and more used to implement some applications with huge data and complex logic processes by a set of complex dynamic languages and architectures like JSP, J2EE, AJAX and so on. E-Commerce is currently one of the most important aspects of modern web applications. E-Commerce lets people purchase goods and exchange information on business transactions online [4]. It gives companies improved efficiency and reliability of business processes through transaction automation, and also attracts a very large number of users by allowing them to electronically exchange goods and services with no barriers of time or distance.

Designing and development of E-commerce web application is a big engineering. This type of project involves many complex business processes and various different technologies. Each of these technologies makes a designing process more complex. This also causes problems with later maintenance of the applications [9]. Aiming at this problem, the Object Management Group (OMG) has proposed an approach to using model in software development known as Model Driven Architecture (MDA) [12]. It implements to separating the specification of the operation of a system from the details of the way that system uses the capabilities of its platform through Platform Independent Model (PIM) design and Platform Specific Model (PSM) design, and automatically generate executable code with model transformation. The three primary goals of MDA are  portability, interoperability and reusability through architectural separation of concerns [11]. In the context of web engineering, there are many approaches which conform to the MDA like WebML[1, 5, 6, 9, 10], UWE[15], WSDM[16], etc. Since E-Commerce web application contain the huge data and complex logic, WebML is the best suitable approach, because the original goal of WebML was to support the design and implementation of so-called data- intensive web applications [6]. WebML provide developer a high level modeling method to divide the whole designing process into few orthogonal dimensions: Data Model, Hypertext Model and Presentation Model in web applications development, and finally generate executable code by CASE tool known as WebRatio[6, 7]. It can efficiently short the cost and improve the development speed and maintainability.

In this paper, we introduce the design method and process for E-Commerce web application based on MDA and WebML. We experiment the development process by a case use which is to modeling and implement a simplified E- Commerce web application, which is a PC online shopping like Dell in WebRatio.



II. MDA AND WEBML  A. Model Driven Architecture (MDA) MDA is an approach to using models in software  development. It supports the model design, store and transformation, and finally automatic generate the usable source code. Its core thinking is to analysis business process, and design the related model, and then abstract the model to build a platform-independent model (PIM, in general, PIM is defined according to the semantics of a model of models, also called a meta-model.), and finally transfer the PIM to one or more platform-specific models (PSMs) that computers can run. The three primary goals of MDA are portability, interoperability and reusability through architectural separation of concerns [11].

B. The Web Modeling Language (WebML) WebML is a third-generation Web design methodology  base on MDA. It is a conceptual language aimed at supporting all the activities and perspectives of Web applications design, especially data-intensive and process- centric web application. According to the MVC framework, WebML model is divided into Data Model, Hypertext Model  2009 Second International Workshop on Computer Science and Engineering  DOI 10.1109/WCSE.2009.239   2009 Second International Workshop on Computer Science and Engineering  DOI 10.1109/WCSE.2009.239   2009 Second International Workshop on Computer Science and Engineering  DOI 10.1109/WCSE.2009.863     and Presentation Model. Figure 1 shows the architecture of the WebML.

? The Data Model describes the conceptual data  organization according to the Entity-Relationship Model.

? The Hypertext Model enables the specification of the front-end of web applications.

? The Presentation Model extends the hypertext model with simple constructs such as operations and transactions, enabling the invocation of predefined operations.



III. E-COMMERCE WEB APPLICATIONS DESIGN IN WEBML  In this section, we describe our experimental use case design processing about using model-driven develop to implement an E-Commerce web application in WebML. We focus on the business processes design of this web application which contains data modeling and hypertext modeling.

A. Requirement Analysis This use case is a personal computer online shopping. It  supports new users can register an account and login the system. There are two types of user: customers and administrators. Aiming to the different users, the system provides the relevant functions:   1) For Customer: Customers can search for computers fulfilling the certain criteria, add the results to a shopping cart, and finally pay for the items in the shopping cart to create the relevant order, and further more customer can check the pending order to decide if he would cancel the pending order.

2) For Administrator: Administrators can manage the order information.

Based on the above analysis, we design the whole system with nine function modules. They are New User Register Module, Login Module, Order Management Module, Cancel Order Module, Search Module, Catalog Module, Shopping Cart Module, Payment Module and Logout Module. Figure 2 shows the structure of the PC online shopping.

B. Data Modeling  Data design is the most important foundation of the web application. WebML supports graphical data modeling based on Entity/Relationship (E/R) model. Figure 3 shows the graphic representation of the data model, describing data underlying the web application for the PC online shopping.

User contains the account information, and is classified into customers and administrator by Group. Module controls the visiting scope of the different Group. Each User is connected to many order_db which contains the order information.

Each order_db is also connected to many products which contains the product information. The product can be retrieval by the certain criteria. Cart is used to memory the cart information.

We respectively design hypertext model for nine function modules, and then connect them to compose the whole hypertext model for the web application of the PC online shopping. In this section we provide the hypertext model of the Shopping Cart Module to describe the hypertext modeling method.

Figure 4 shows the hypertext model of shopping cart  module in WebML. Customers view the PC goods information represented by Product detail DataUnit in the Product detail Page. After customers choose this goods, the goods will be added into the cart data table by AddToCart AddUnit, and then follow the OKLink (green link) to Cart Content Page which will display the selected goods in cart data table by Cart details MultiDataUnit. We can clear goods from shopping cart by EmptyCart DeleteUnit. If the result of empty cart operation is success, the response will follow the OKLink (green link) to Cart Content Page, otherwise the response will follow the KOLink (red link) to Cart Content Page.

D. WebML Syntax and Code Generation The data model and hypertext model will be stored in a  single formal XML file based on WebML syntax, for example, Figure 5 shows the XML code of the EmptyCart DeleteUnit.

Figure 5. The hypertext model of Shopping Cart Module    The WebRatio (the CASE tool of WebML) will automatically generate the database by Web Model and the executable source code of Web applications conform to Struts framework by Hypertext Model. Figure 6 shows the screenshot of the Product Index Page.



IV. CONCLUSION This paper has illustrated the modeling and  implementation method of the E-Commerce web application based on MDA in WebML. E-Commerce web applications are abstracted to the formal platform-independent model specified in WebML, and automatically generated by WebRatio. When the system need be maintained, we only need modify the model. For that reason, this method can effectively short development lifecycle and increase maintainability.
