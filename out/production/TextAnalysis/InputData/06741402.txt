An algorithm for identifying differentially expressed genes in multiclass RNA-seq samples

Abstract?Gene expression in the whole cell can be routinely measured by microarray technologies or recently by using se- quencing technologies. Using these technologies, identifying Dif- ferentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) among multiple phenotypes is one of the most important tasks in biology. Thus many methods for detecting DEGs between two groups has been developed. For example, T-test and relative entropy are used for detecting the difference between two probability distributions. When more than two phenotypes are considered, these methods are not applicable and other methods such as ANOVA F-test and Kruskal-Wallis are used for finding DEGs in the multiclass data. However, ANOVA F-test assumes a normal distribution and it is not designed to identify DEGs where gene are expressed distinctively in each of phenotypes. Kruskal-Wallis method, a non-parametric method, is more robust but sensitive to outliers. This paper proposes a non- parametric and information theoretical approach for identifying DEGs in the multiple class data and the approach is less sensitive to outliers. In extensive experiments with simulated and real data, our method outperformed existing tools. In addition, a web service is implemented for the analysis of multi-class data: http://biohealth.snu.ac.kr/software/degselection  Keywords?Multiclass problem, RNA-seq, Differentially ex- pressed genes, Bioinformatics.



I. INTRODUCTION  In biology, variations in phenotypes or disease states can be often explained by differences in gene expression levels.

Thus, many technologies have been developed to measure gene expression levels of biological samples. Until recently, microarrays or DNA chip have been the most widely used method. A microarray is composed of a large number of specific probes that are hybridized with certain cDNAs. cDNAs are synthesized from mRNAs in each sample by reverse transcriptases and these cDNAs are hybridized with probes.

Depending on the amount of hybridization, each spot of the probes has different intensity of fluorescence. In this way, gene expression levels of a sample can be measured. However, measuring gene expression levels based on the intensity of fluorescence has limitations in terms of reproducibility and resolution. Recently, sequencing technologies, known as the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technique, have achieved capacity enough to measure levels of gene expressions in the whole cell in a single experiment. While microarrays measure the abundance of a transcript by a fluorescence intensity, RNA sequencing measures it by a count of sequenced reads.

Therefore, the absolute expression levels can be measured and it can provide a higher resolution in measuring gene expression  levels. For this reason, the sequencing technology begins to replace the microarray technology rapidly.

Once we measure expression levels of genes from cells of multiple phenotypes, identifying genes that are expressed differentially is an important research question. These genes are called differentially expressed genes (DEGs). To detect genes that are expressed differentially in multiple phenotypes, a number of samples for each phenotype are routinely used.

In this situation, identifying DEGs requires sophisticated tech- niques. Technical challenges are that a DEG should express consistently within samples of the same phenotype while it should express differentially among samples of different phenotypes. To detect DEGs, a number of algorithms have been developed.

Many studies have been conducted on detecting DEGs be- tween two groups. For example, T-test and relative entropy[1] are used for detecting the difference between two probability distributions. However, finding DEGs from more than two groups is a more difficult problem. A multiclass problem is referred to a problem that has more than two groups. Most of the methods finding the difference between two groups cannot be directly applied to multiclass problems. ANOVA F-test, information gain and gini index are used for gene selection in multiclass data [3], [4]. ANOVA F-test assesses whether the mean values within several groups differ from each other.

The problem of ANOVA F-test is that it selects genes which have a significantly different expression level in one phenotype and have similar expression levels in the other phenotypes. The method that is proposed in this paper selects a gene as a DEG when a gene has all different expression levels according to all different phenotypes.

As NGS is replacing microarray technique, different meth- ods have been developed for identifying DEGs because the nature of RNA-seq data and microarray data are different. In this paper, we review existing methods and propose a non- parametric and information theoretic method for identifying DEGs in RNA-seq data. In addition, we implemented a web service for identifying DEGs and also for biological analysis of DEGs.



II. RELATED WORKS  Gene expression data from RNA-seq experiments of mul- tiple samples can be represented in a matrix form. When the number of samples is m and the number of genes is n, the     gene expression data is represented in a n ?m matrix. A gene expression level Yij is a count of mapped reads of i? th gene in j ? th sample.

There are several packages that are used for extracting DEGs from RNA sequencing data. Most of these tools assume that Yij follows a parametric distribution such as Poisson and negative binomial. EdgeR[5] and DESeq[6] are Bioconductor packages for analysing differential expression of RNA-seq data. These tool assume that Yij follow a negative binomial distribution. After fitting a result of RNA-seq experiments to a specific model, these tools perform differential expression analysis using an exact test analogous to Fisher?s exact test.

The limitation of these tools is that they can not be directly adjusted to multiclass problems. Cuffdiff[7] is a differential expression analysis program included in Cufflinks that is a transcript assembly program. The limitation of Cuffdiff is that it performs analysis between two samples, not between groups.

PoissonSeq[8] and SAMseq[2] provide solutions for mul- ticlass problems. PoissonSeq assume that Yij follow a Poisson distribution. This tool is not robust when there are outliers in an input, because one outlier can largely affect the parameter of a fitted model. For this reason, SAMseq suggests a non- parametric model, Kruskal-Wallis method, to analyse differen- tial expression. Kruskal-Wallis method is explained below.

K =  N(N + 1)  g? i=1  nir? i ? 3(N + 1) (1)  ? N : The total number of observations.

? ni : The number of observations in group i.

? g : The number of groups.

? rij : The rank of observation j from group i.

? r?i : ?  ni j=1  rij  ni . The average rank of samples in group i.

This equation returns a low score when r?i of each group have nearly equal values, and returns a high score when r?i are skewed across the groups. SAMseq finds DEGs based on this property. Although SAMseq is more robust than PoissonSeq, there is some chance it can be affected if there are outliers.



III. MOTIVATION  Many approaches employ a parametric model to identify differential expression analysis. However, when real data is not fitted to these parametric models, the performance of those programs becomes low. Also, there is no guarantee that RNA- seq data follow a certain parametric model. When an outlier exists in data sets, parameters of parameter models can be affected largely. A previous study[2] shows that parameter models are not robust when an outlier exists. To solve this problem, we suggest a non-parametric model that can be used for any kind of model.

SAMseq that uses Kruskal-Wallis method for testing dif- ferential expression is more robust than the methods based on parametric models. However, it also has an weakness that the score is highly affected by highly ranked inputs. Also, when outliers change the ranks of elements, the score is dramatically changed. To solve this problem, we suggest an information theoretic approach that is more robust for outliers.



IV. METHODS  A. Overview of a proposed method  We are proposing a method to get DEGs in multiple classes.

We measured the score of each gene by the following steps.

First of all, we normalized the input count data by using the Reads Per Kilobase per Million reads(RPKM) concept. After that, we changed expression levels(real values) to rank values that is a widely used technique in non-parametric methods.

We discretized expression values based on their ranking. The number of discretized groups is equal to the number of classes.

We call the discretized values Discretized Ranks(DRs). Then we calculate mutual information between DRs and class labels.

If the DRs and class labels have a high mutual information value, then we can conclude that this gene has different expression levels for each class.

The detailed process is explained below.

B. Preprocessing data  RNA-seq reads are mapped to a reference genome by mapping programs such as Bowtie[9] and Tophat[10]. To obtain a read count table of genes from a mapped data, we can use the GenomicRanges package[11] in Bioconductor or the HTSeq Python package[12] or Cufflinks. These programs have their own algorithms to calculate read counts of each genes. After we get a count table, we normalize the count table by RPKM. RPKM is an widely used technique for normalizing count data and it normalizes data by considering the sequencing depth and the length of a gene. These processes are preprocessing steps for the input data. The normalized count table can be represented in a n ? m matrix when n is the number of genes and m is the number of samples. Let us define Yij as a normalized count of mapped reads of i ? th gene in j ? th sample. Yij is changed to a discretized rank DRij . If the rank of sample j is in the range from ?m/g ? k? to ?m/g ? (k+1)?, the discretized rank of sample j is k+1. g is the number of classes. If two samples have the same rank, the dicretized ranks of two samples also should have the same value. Table I is one example showing that RPKM values are changed to discretized ranks. In this example, 3 classes exist and 3 samples exist for each class.

Difference analysis using mutual information  The mutual information(MI) is a measure of the mutual dependence of two random variables. We analysed differential expression by measuring the mutual information between the class labels and the discretized ranks(DRs). If the mutual information of a gene is high, this gene is differentially expressed across all groups.

MI(X,Y ) = ? x?X  ? y?Y  p(x, y)log p(x, y)  p(x)p(y) (2)  ? X : The class labels  ? Y : The discretized ranks  D. Estimating P-value  Estimating a P-value is a statistical method to measure the significance of the score from the previous step. A P-value indicates the probability that a score from a randomly gener- ated instance is greater or equal to the score from the previous step. So, if the p-value of the score is small, the score has significance. We used random permutation method to calculate P-values. This technique is widely used to measure p-values in non-parametric models. Discretized ranks are randomly generated 100,000 times and scores(mutual information) are calculated for each iteration. Based on this score, We can make a null hypothesis distribution. After that, for each gene, We calculated the score of the gene and P-value as the probability that random scores are higher than the score of the gene.



V. RESULTS  A. Data  1) Simulated data: To test our algorithm and compare it with existing tools, we generated simulated data from a Poisson distribution. The reason we used Poisson distribution for ran- dom data is that RNA-seq can be modeled as a simple random sampling. In this model, each read is sampled uniformly and independently from every possible nucleotides[13][14]. So, the number of reads mapping to a gene follows a binomial distri- bution and it can be approximated by a Poisson distribution. A Poisson distribution has one parameter, ?. A random variable X of a Poisson distribution follows Pr(X = k) = ?  ke?k  k! .

? is equal to the expected value of X, E(X). By using this distribution, we can randomly generate simulated data that is similar to real data. By using these simulated data, we compare the performance of the algorithms.

2) Real data: We also applied our algorithm to real bio- logical data. We used breast cancer data. The breast cancer data is from The Cancer Genome Atlas(TCGA)[15].We chose 3 groups (Normal, Basal, Luminal A) from the TCGA data for our research. The characteristics of Basal type (Basal-like carcinoma) is that they do not have estrogen receptors, proges- terone receptors or Her2/neu proteins. For this reason, Basal type is also called as the triple negative breast cancer[16].

Luminal A type has estrogen receptors with low grade.

B. Classification results  To check whether our algorithm is working appropriately or not, we performed classification on each DEG. We selected a gene as a DEG when it had different expression levels for different classes. So, the expression levels of DEGs have class-prediction power. Therefore, a classifier that uses the DEG as a feature can output the class accurately. KNN(k- nearest neighbour) algorithm was used for classifier because it is sensitive to the quality of the feature.

Fig. 2. The mean of accuracy of the top DEGs when an outlier is included.

The mean accuracy of the top 50 DEGs from SAM and PoissonSeq decreased when an outlier is included. However, our method shows robust accuracy when an outlier is included.

1) Simulated data: We checked the accuracy of the classi- fier when using expression values of one gene as an input. We performed this 50 times for each of the top 50 genes. To our knowledge, only SAM[2] and PoissonSeq[8] can be used for identifying DEGs in multiclass RNA-seq data. We compared our tool which is based on mutual information with existing tools. The result is shown in Figure 1. As shown in Figure 1, the method based on mutual information shows higher mean of accuracy than other tools.

Also, we tested the case that includes outliers. The expres- sion level of the outliers are set to be 100 times bigger than the original value. This can be represented as Yij = 100 ?Yij .

For the test, we set one sample among input samples as an outlier sample. Figures 2 shows that our tool is more robust than other existing tools.

2) Real data: Figure 3 shows the box plot of accuracy of the top 50 DEGs in breast cancer data. The mutual information based approach shows higher classification accuracy than other tools also in real data.

C. Biological interpretation  To understand how DEGs lead to biological differences of groups, we researched the biological functions of DEGs.

We researched annotations of DEGs and found pathway and functional annotations of DEGs.

1) Breast cancer data: We identified DEGs in normal cells and 2 subtypes of breast cancer(Basal and Luminal A). The top 10 DEGs are listed in Table II. There are some genes that are related to cell cycle(CCNB2, CDC20, CDCA8) in the list.

This is because cancer is highly affected by the cell cycle.

We performed pathway analysis and functional annotation with the top 50 genes by using DAVID[17]. The result of KEGG pathway analysis is shown in Table III and the result of functional annotation is shown in IV. In the result of the KEGG pathway analysis, cell cycle and p53 signalling pathways are selected as significant. p53 is well known as a tumor suppressor protein[18]. So, the result from our tool is reasonable for explaining the difference between normal and breast cancer subtypes. In the result of functional annotation analysis, nuclear division, chromosome segregation and spin- dle microtubule are selected as significant. Some studies[19] suggested that microtubule is related to cell apoptosis and is related to breast cancer.



VI. CONCLUSION  To identify DEGs in multiclass RNA-seq data, we proposed a non-parametric and information theoretical approach. This method is based on a ranking approach and mutual informa- tion. In the results, we showed this method outperforms other existing tools in terms of classification accuracy. Also, we  TABLE II. THE ANNOTATIONS OF THE TOP 10 DEGS IN THE BREAST CANCER DATA.
