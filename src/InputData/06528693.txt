A Data Mining Algorithm Based on Joint  Distribution Rules in Disaster Risk Valuation

Abstract?A jointing distribution data was mined by copula  algorithm for disaster risk control in this paper. We illustrate  all these concepts with an example of severe dust storm and  consider samples of simultaneous observations in most  important two numerical hazard variables of maximum wind  speed and duration. The analysis emphasizes how  inappropriate in the variables jointing can become in cases of  significant departure from the linear hypothesis. The results  show that with the help of the cumulative probability curve  according to put forward a kind of cleaning association rules  based on the copula algorithm, the multiple variables jointing  can be engaged and the differences of goodness fit between  copula jointing data and linear jointing data can be visually  compared. Based on the optimization of the evaluation  parameters in copulas model, bivariate jointing distribution  can be completely captured by the Frank copula model by  demonstrating its usefulness and efficiency from the data  tracking of accuracy for dust storms disaster.

I. INTRODUCTION  Many complex and dynamic systems are known to experience critical transitions, causing disastrous harm to society, such as in the form of large earthquakes, sudden climate changes or financial bubbles. In natural disaster, for example, sudden large changes in disaster intensity and volume appear periodically, and disaster occurrence behavior in such extreme periods has been observed to be quite different from normal tendencies. For the purpose of disaster risk control, it is crucial to understand the behavior of events that have large effects but occur only rarely based on probability distribution and multiple impact factors. In traditional return period analysis, however, in conventional  statistics, have focused on the analysis of central tendencies of univariate data, and infrequent but large changes have been nuisance factors and are often removed from data sets.

Multivariate analysis usual take an attention on linear jointing and assumption is an independence of the learning samples. Consequently, it has been difficult to reveal complex dependence structures in the areas of disaster systems. The data mining with multiple factors and without the linear assumption in disaster is necessary.

For disaster data, we need to understand its local behavior and global characteristics. Capturing a local behavior is essentially a difficult task because the target phenomenon of hazard factors is nonlinear and occurs only infrequently as well as their dependence structure is complex. One reason for this is that the amount of data required for a sufficiently accurate estimation is larger for local dependence than for global dependence. The data structure to be identified is complicated, requiring a data mining of multivariate joint.

Another difficulty is that disaster events including sudden large changes tend to follow fat-tailed distributions. In order to exploit the effect data of jointing distribution of large disaster from complex dynamical systems, it is necessary to capture and mine method of joint multiple variables that can be drawn by an efficient dependence measure in adaption of disaster characteristics.



II. RELATED WORKS  The researches on theory and application of climatic probability distribution fitting of observational data have been made great advances along with the climate change estimation (Kuhn et al., 2007). Among the few measures used for capturing a jointing distribution and dependence structure, a function called a copula has gained considerable attention, particularly for analyzing multivariate dependence  - 539 -    in financial risk management (Charpentier et al. 2009; Lin CH et al. 2008). The main statistical advantage of a copula is that it is possible to replicate data sets through simulation using any type of marginal distribution.

Based on previous works, we can see that risk valuation of meteorological disaster cannot work without the assistance of distribution functions. The uncertainty of the functions is caused by multiple factors, the randomness of the meteorological hazard and the uncertainty of the underling surface hazard. The risk resulting from meteorological hazard can be reduce by increasing forecast level, which is guaranteed by the climate models, whereas the risk engendered by fluctuating underlying surface is difficult to be reduced. The copula model for meteorological disaster was first proposed by LI et al, (2010) based on the adaptive parameter estimation, which combines the features of weather factor and land factor with additional devices in dust storms for an improvement in accuracy, without requiring any prior knowledge or assumptions. The aim of this article is to discuss some marginal functions of disaster under random multiple hazards using copula and linear regression, deduce their cumulative distribution functions as well as their tail construction, which can give us a deeper and full understanding of the data mining in disaster risk valuation.



III. DISASTER AND DATA SOURCES  A. Dust storm disaster  Dust storms are phenomena that occur when wind blows dust and sand from the ground into the air, leading to turbidity with a visibility of less than 1 km. Xinghuangqi (XHQ) is a representative stations in Inner Mongolia of China.

B. The contributing data  Data observed samples collected from the records of China Meteorological Administration (CMA) during 1990 to 2006, there were 69 severe dust storms during the 17 years.

Every sample included six serial of statistical data potentially influencing dust storm, which includes duration of severe dust storm (SDS), daily of precipitation (Dp), underlying surface temperature (Dt), soil surface moisture (Dm), maximum wind speed (Dmv), and duration of maximum wind speed (Ddv).

Based on Pearson's correlation analysis between SDS and  other data, two data serials passed the P = 0.01 significance tests, they are Dmv as first contributing factor, Ddv as second contributing factor. The two contributing data were considered to be jointed in the bivariate distribution analysis.



IV. A ALGORITHM OF DATA MINING  A. Goodness-of- fit test of univariate data and bivariate data  Comparing regression models with unitary linear and binary linear, the correlation coefficient R of observed value and univatiate Dmv or Ddv is 0.624 and 0.359, respectively, while the R of bivariate Dmv and Ddm is 0.693. The standard deviation (Sd) of yi was decreasing from 135.81, 162.19 to 126.32 (Table 1) in the three situation. This result show that if consider both Dmv and Ddv, the goodness of fit is better than unitary models. But the error between observed value and regression value still exist. Data jointing in bivariate linear regression model not solves well the problem of bivariate data jointing in complex disaster system.

Goodness-of- fit test of Copula-based data  As we known, the disaster data distributions include nonlinear, noise and outliers. Estimation of such distributions is difficult using conventional linear approaches. Copula-based method enables capturing the nonlinear structure of extreme events with its jointing distribution.

The copula approach to dependence modeling is rooted in a representation theorem attributed to Sklar  Given two correlated random variables X and Y, if FX,Y(X,Y) is a two-dimensional distribution function with marginal distributions FX(X) and FY(Y), there exists a copula C such that  ? ? (1)  - 540 -    Conversely, for any distributions FX(X), FY(Y) and any copula C, the function FX,Y(X,Y) defined above is a two-dimensional distribution function. Furthermore, if FX(X) and FY(Y) are continuous, then C is unique, and easily be generalized to an n-dimensional framework, although this is not a topic considered in this paper.

Under the assumption that the marginal distributions are continuous with probability density functions FX(X) and FY(Y), the joint probability density function (pdf) can be written as  ? ?( , ) ( ), ( ) ( ) ( )X,Y X Y X Yf x y c F x F y f x f y (2)  Where c is the density function of C, defined as  2 ( , )( , ) C u vc u v u v  *   * * (3)  Where u and v denote the cumulative distribution functions  (cdf), the values of which range from zero to one.

The two Archimedean one-parameter copulas presented  in Table 2 are often used in natural sciences and engineering due to they can be applied to negatively correlated random  variables. The value of RMES and AIC in which the smaller the value correspond to the Copulas function as the optimal coupling function.

The computed value Pi is the joint probability given in Eq. (1), and the observed value Pei is the empirical joint probability of the two random variables.

Based on goodness-of-fit tests of the copula models, Frank copulas have smallest AIC and RMSE, therefore, Frank copula was selected as the best bivariate model in this disaster case (Table 2).

C. Goodness-of- fit test of cumulative probability  Based on all the adjusted data shown in Table 3, the joint cumulative probability by Frank copula has a highest R2 0.987 in the four generating process. The cdf probability  with bivariate jointing can be engaged.

Specially, by the Q-Q figure analysis, the goodness-of-fit  test in tail distribution of F-Copula has an obvious improvement than other data generation (Table 3) by Sd.

Similar as correlation coefficient analysis above, mean Sd of  - 541 -    bivariate linear regression (129) is better than univariate regression (136.3 and 158.91) but worse than copula (55.9).

The precisions of the cumulative probability in different section are different. For the bivariate linear regression, the noise in high section (Sd =0.81-1.0) is more obvious for the observation than in low-medium section due to the Sd is larger in section 0.0-0.2 and section 0.21-0.8. The precisions of Frank-copula in the high section (Sd =0.81-1.0) is more significant than in low-medium section due to its Sd is smallest in all sections. Fitting higher value tails presents an available probably by frank-copula cumulative distribution.

Therefore, in the statistical data analysis literature the copula-based bivariate jointing probability distribution measures for disaster was suggested. At a minimum, it can ensure that a multiple factors joint arising from a fitted copula model is "realistic" for tail distribution in higher value.

V. Conclusion and discussion  In conclusion, a trend for an increasing temperature was observed in recent years, but if the cumulative probability of developing severe recurrent disaster remain changed need to be attention on. It is necessary to carry on data mining in adapting the disaster characteristics, such as jointing probability distribution with multiple hazard factors.

Here in, it is shown that the linear regression models for SDS as a product to analyze bivariate distribution are problematic, since the true form of the data-generating process is generally not known if the independences exists a  linear relationship, while the linear assumption be usually made artificially. Therefore new jointing distribution data are proposed.

Best-practice advice here, we have shown how multivariate data exhibiting complex patterns of SDS can be modeled using copula, and how allow inference on the parameters of the frank-copula on the hazards construction.

Further, this copula algorithm is not necessary that we have assumed the observations of the multivariate data are independent, the models can be built and estimated whenever there exist a likelihood function of the data.

The proposed copula algorithm enables the capture of an entire dependence structure, providing insight into the functional relationship between two variables. A better precision of the cumulative probability in higher of the bivariate copula might give us some clues on how to improve the distribution of SDS performance given the observations following unknown distributions.

As a multivariate for future disaster research, there is an increasing tendency to collect more numbers multivariate and dense observation data, requiring produce and mine more powerful joint data methods and goodness-of-fit tests for capturing functional relationships among multivariate.

This paper shows that it is crucial for explores the large space of possible copula models in disaster valuation, and there is a good possibility of extending into three to four dimensions or more.

In our analysis, although the marginal distribution generation of data set avoid in identifying artificially, the non-parametric estimation may become the main problem regarding marginal function generation with unknown function structure. Through example estimates of copulas used in foreign exchange rates and stock returns, Takada T (2008) warned about the risks of model misspecification in the empirical determination of parametric. It is a emphasis in the future research.
