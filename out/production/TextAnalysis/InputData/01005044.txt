Association Analysis with Interval Valued Fuzzy  Sets and Body of Evidence

Abstract - Association analysis is proven to be  one of the most useful techniques in data mining to ana- lyze large datasets. In this paper, we apply associa- tion analysis to fuzzy datasets and show how it works in decision making process. We define three funda- mental concepts: belief, compatibility, and plausibil- ity for association analysis in terms of fuzzy logic.

We further extend our study on association analysis with interval valued fuzzy sets and body of evidence.

Applications with sample data are discussed.



I. Introduction In this section, we briefly introduce data mining, ass*  ciation analysis in data mining, and fuzzy sets.

A. The need for data mining  The fast growing, tremendous amount of data, collected and stored in large databases, has exceeded human abil- ity for comprehension. As a result, data collected in large databases often become ?data tomb??-data archives that are seldom revisited. On the other hand, important de- cisions are often made not based on the information-rich data but rather on a decision maker?s intuition, simply because the decision maker may not have the tools to extract the valuable knowledge embedded in the vast amounts of data [5] .

The widening gap between data and information calls for a systematic development of tools that will turn data tombs into gold nuggets of knowledge. Data mining has attracted a great deal of attention recently. Data mining tools that perform data analysis may uncover important data patterns, contributing greatly to business strategies, knowledge bases, and scientific and medical research.

B. Association analysis  Association analysis is very useful for data analysis. It can generate association rules showing the items which frequently appear together [5]. For example, in a medical database, if most patients who had cough and fever and  headache actually suffer flu. Then, one may deduce the rule ?if a patient has cough and fever and headache, then hehasfluverylikely?. Let S = { s l , s z , . . . , s ~ }  b e a s e t of attributes(symptoms, diseases), and T be a database such that t c S for every t E T .  Let X and Y be two distinct subsets of S. If it is true, for most t E T ,  if t contains X then t contains Y as well; then we may draw an association rule [Z] as X + Y from the database T.

There are two parameters associated with a rule: sup- port and confidence. To define these parameters, we use T, and T, to denote the largest subsets of T that con- tain X, and both X and Y, respectively. It is obvious T, 2 T, C T. The support of the rule X --f Y is the ratio of the cardinality of T, to the cardinality of T ,  i. e.

- IT?? The confidence of the ruie X + Y is the ratio of IT1 ?  I T S  I ITJ?  the cardinality of T. to the cardinality of T,, - In this paper, ow main concern is support.

C. Mining association rules  Usually mining of association rules includes two steps [5]:  Find all frequent itemsets: All frequent itemsets should appear a t  least as frequently as minimum support count.

Generate strong association rules from the frequent sets: strong association rules should satisfy mini- mum support and confidence threshold.

The dominant part of an association rules discovery algorithm is to find the subset T, of T with strong s u p port. Once T, is deemed to have strong support, it is an easy task to decide which item in the itemset can be the consequent by using the confidence threshold which have strong support.

In this paper, our concern is mainly in the first step.

We use Apriori algorithm proposed in [l] to find the fre- quent large itemsets, and then we show how to use these frequent itemsets in a fuzzy logic-based decision-making system.

This is because of that a patient may have ?some fever? vs. ?high fever?, or ?mild cough? vs. ?severe cough? in reality. To describe such ?fuzzy? properties, we need to use fuzzy logic.

Consider a set M ,  we say that A is a fuzzy subset of M if A is a function from M into [0, 11. The value of A at  an element z of X is the membership of 2 in A. The operations of union, intersection and complement can he extended to fuzzy subset by  (AV B)W= m m  IA(z) ,B(z)} , (AA B)(z)= min { A ( z ) , B ( z ) } ,  and  By Cardinality of A, denoted by IAl, we mean r A ( z ) .

( ~ A ) ( z ) =  1 - A(z)   11. Association analysis wi th  fuzzy set A. Motivation  Information gained from data mining is often not ready to he used by domain experts. For example, association analysis often yields thousands of rules, which are still hard to analyze. Therefore, we need to integrate data mining tools with other analysis techniques to convert the information to knowledge which can be used more easily by human beings. On the other hand, in the field of decision making, huge amount of data often has to he processed first, and due to the lack of efficient analysis tools, often we have to use the estimates from domain ex- pert or portion of the data instead of results from a thor- ough analysis of available data. As we h o w ,  one goal of data mining is to deal with large datasets efficiently and effectively. Therefore, integrating data mining tech- niques with decision making systems will yield a better analysis system.

In solving real world problems, accurate data may not exist, and accurate computation may be impossible or not necessary. With uncertainty and ambiguity, however, people need to  make unambiguous high-quality decisions.

Fuzzy logic bridges the gap between ambiguous process of decision making and explicit demonstration of how a decision is made or possible refinement and justification.

Fuzzy logic control system has been successfully used in consumer appliances, industrial process control and au- tomotive applications, just to cite a few examples [4] [6]  The integration of data mining, fuzzy logic and deci- sion making techniques can benefit all these three areas.

We will show how to perform association analysis on a fuzzy set and transform the association rules further into decisions in the following sections of this paper.

B. Deriving association rule in a fuzzy dataset  In a traditional transaction set, we are sure that one transaction contains a specific item or not. But in some cases this ?containment? relation can he better described using fuzzy values. Now, we discuss how to generate as- sociation rules on a fuzzy set using Apriori algorithm.

We will define associations by the use of three functions: compatibility, belief and plausibility by extending their traditional definitions to our present setting.

B.1 Finding large itemsets  Let t k  be a fuzzy data item and t k  = 5- P j k / S j  for k = j  1, ..., N .  We define support(sj) = r . N  h, where 0 5 I  P j k  I 1 and N is the size of dataset. We also define fuzzy large itemsets of cardinality one by  A:?) = {sjlsupport(sj) 2 7 ) .

where T is some rectified threshold for ?large? we define the support of 2-itemset as:  The fuzzy large itemsets of cardinality two can he de- fined as  A?) = {(sj,si)Isupport(sj,si) 2 T }  (2)  Similarly,  = {(sj,~r,~k)~suPPOrt(~j,~i,sk) 2 7 )  (4) In general, we can define the support and large m  itemset A!?) as well for n 5 N .

B.2 Compatibility, belief and plausibility  After the definition of fuzzy large itemsets, we now try to perform association analysis. Let d be a possible fuzzy consequent i .e.  d = a;/S;, where SI, Sz,. . . , S, are sets of items in S as defined in the previous section, and 0 5 ai 5 1 indicates to what extent the set of Si implies the presence of d. Our objective is to decide any possible relationships between d and a given fuzzy set of items P = C,fl;/S,. In our sample application we are interested in ?large itemsets?, S1,Sz, _.., S,.

i  We now define compatibility of d with P as  0-7803-7280-8/02/$10.00 02,2002 IEEE 519    Comp(d,F)(u) = supd(z) (5) where the sup is taken over 2 such that P ( z )  = U. Thus, Comp(d, F )  is a fuzzy subset of [0, 11. For the traditional setting of compatibility, readers may refer [7].

For P E U.A<?). we define a mass on P as .. , I m(P) =  Let I(S; C d)  = -, we can define the belief of d  where T E &,A?). c s u p p o w )  ? 1dAS.l  ldl 1 - 1  is a consequent of P by  Bel(d) = X I ( &  c d)m(S,) where the sum is over all S; E U,A?) i .e .  over all large sets.

Let J(S;#d) = max ab (the max is taken over sk E S,), we can also define the plausibility as  Pls(d) = c J(S,#d)m(S;) where the sum is over all Si E U,A?).

For the traditional settings and use of belief and plau- sibility, readers may refer [9], [lo]. Note the fact that I (S;  C d)  5 J(S;#d).  The operator I plays the role of the ?weakest implication? of S; + d and J plays the role of largest intersection (i.e. possibility) of S; and d.

C. A sample application  In this sample application, we assume that a dataset con- sists of symptoms of different patients (when a disease is prevailing, we could have thousands of patients in a data- base). The symptom could happen in different diseases.

Each of the diseases is represented as a fuzzy set of symp toms. We perform the association analysis to determine what symptoms and their combinations may occur most frequently which can give us some hints of what diseases are prevailing for the group of patients.

C.1 Data We denote the symptom set as S = {A,B,C,D,E}  and a disease as d. Here is a sample symptom set for four patients. The number, between 0 and 1 attached with each symptoms, reflects the degree of presence for that symptom.

Table 1.

0-7803-7280-8/02/$10.00 02,2002 IEEE  C.2 Finding large itemsets  From data in Table 1, we try to derive the large item- sets as we described in the previous section. We as- sume that large support should be no less that 0.38 i . e .

T = 0.38. Then, the supports for all 1-itemsets are: supportA = 0.38, supportB = 0.48, supportC = 0.50, supportD = 0.23, and supportE = 0.48. Hence, the large 1-itemset is: Ai1) = {A, B, C, E}.

Since D is excluded, we only consider 2-itemset {AB, AC, AE, BC, BE, CE}. The supports for these 2- itemsets are: supportAB = 0.10, supportAC = 0.35, supportAE = 0.18, supportBC = 0.23, supportBE = 0.40, and supportCE = 0.28. Hence, the large %itemset is: Ai?) = {BE}.

Since Ai2) has only one member, Ai3), A$*), and Ai5) are empty.

C.3 Compatibility, belief and plausibility  Provided that the symptoms for a patient is P = 0.38/B + 0.38/C + 0.32/BE. We try to find the com- patibility he may suffer the disease d = 0.4/A + 0.8/C + 0.5/E. Based on the given data, the possible U?S in (5) over which Comp(d,P) # 0 are 0.38 and 0.32. Thus, Comp(d,P)(0.38) = supd(z) where z E { B , C }  so Comp(d, P)(0.38) = 0.8. Comp(d, P) (0.32) = 0 because d = 0 on BE.

We also calculate the belief of our fuzzy decision. First we use the support from last section to compute the mass for each large itemset: m(A) = 0.17, m(B) = 0.21, m(C) = 0.22, m(E) = 0.21, and m(BE) = 0.19.

We also have I(A c d)  = 0.4, I(B c d )  = 0, I(C c d )  = 0.8, I(BE c d )  = 0.25, and I(E c d )  = 0.5. So, Bel(d) = 0.4.

For the plausibility, we have: J(A#d) = 0.4, J ( B # d ) = 0, J(C#d) = 0.8, J(E#d) = 0.5, and J (BE#d) = 0.5.

So, Pls(d) = 0.46.

In this sample application, we have found the compat- ibility, belief and plausibility in association analysis with fuzzy set. Compatibility gives us an estimation of how much some disease is compatible with symptoms present, to some degree, in a population. The belief and plau- sibility functions are traditionally used to measure the amount of uncertainty present.

111. Association analysis with interval valued fuzzy set  A. Motivation  In Table 1, we assumed that the expert was able to pin- point exactly the amount of presence of symptoms on patients. Typically, experts feel more comfortable to de- scribe the presence of symptoms by a range i.e. an in-     terval. More realistically the symptom table should look like:  Table 2.

In this section, we try to define the concepts of com-  patibility, belief and plausibility for interval valued fuzzy sets. We still focus on ?large itemsets?.

B. Deriving association rule in interval valued fuzzy  B.1 Finding large itemset We now view data as a fuzzy set where the val-  ues of the membership functions are intervals: t k  = c @ J k , F 3 k ] / s J .  Then, we can define ?the lower support? and ?the upper support?, LSupport(s,) = 1 1 y k usupport(s*) = y x F J ~ .  k Thus, we can de- fine the 1-itemset support as  dataset  If the threshold for large itemset is T ,  we can define the concept of ?large itemset to some degree? hy look- ing at  the suhsetbood of support(sj) in (511: > T}, i.e.

w([l?ul ? .?) where UJ is the width function of an interval, i .e. ,  w([l ,u])  = U  - 1.

U J ( [ 4 4 ) We now take two parameters . the threshold T  the degree to which we would like the support to exceed T and we call the degree e ,  The support of Zitemset can be similarly defined as  Proceeding as the above, we can define A$:i and etc.

B.2 Compatibility, belief and plausibility  Let d = [&,E,]/S; be a possible fuzzy consequent,  where SI, Sz, ? .  . , S, are ?large itemsets to degree e? as we defined, and 0 I 5 Ei 5 1. Let P he a set in U,A: i .e .  P = &,n /Si.  Our objective is to define the compatibility, belief and plausibility between d and P.

We now try to perform association analysis. To de- h e  ?interval-valued? compatibility, a natural extension of (8) is:  i  i  We define the mass of P as m(P) = [?,??I C U T  C1T  ~~  where T E U,A$?) and support(T) = [ ~ T , u T ] .  In the standard situation CsEonap m(S) should ?add up to l?, in the classical case, we let go of this condition.

By analogy with the previous section we can define the quantities of I (S;  C d )  and J(S;#d) when the support of Si is an interval and d is also interval valued.

I (S ,  C d )  = - [ c G] (13) sresi SkE.7,  Note I (S ,  c d)  ?is less? than J(S,#d) in the sense that max{I(S, C d ) , J ( S i # d ) }  = J(S i#d) .  Also note that J and I play the role of ?largest intersection? and ?fraction of S; in d? since Si = . . . + l/sk + . . . and k , E k k ]  A 1 = h,&] and I is  With the I and J defined as the above, we can extend the belief and plausibility defined in the previous section in terms of interval valued functions as:  Bel(d) = x I ( S ;  c d)m(S,) (15) Id A S.1  where I(d c S,) = - and the sum is over all Si E u,A!?) i .e .  over all large itemsets.

Id1 1 suPPort(sj,sl) = [Ejk A & , F j b  A p i k ]  (10) b  We can also define the plausibility as The large 2-itemset to degree e can be defined as  Pls(d) = C J ( S i # d ) m ( S , )  (16)  2 e }  where J(S,#d)  = maxcuk (the max is taken over sk E Si) the sum is over all S; E U,A!n).

w(support(sj, S I )  n {z 2 T } )  (11)  0-7803-7280-81026 10.00 02002 IEEE 52 1    C. A sample application  C.1 Finding large itemsets  In this sample application, we use data in Table 2 to derive the large itemsets. We assume that large support should be no less that 0.38 i.e. T = 0.38 and e 2 0.15.

supportA = [.30,.40], supportB = [.40,.53], supportC = [.40,.50], supportD = l.20, ,231, and supportE = I.40, ,581. By equation (9), we have the large 1-itemset: A$!i = {A,B, C, E}.

Since D is excluded, we only consider {AB, AC, AE, BC, BE,  CE} among all 2-itemsets. From (10) and ( l l ) , we have the large 2-itemset: AZi = { B E } .

Since A$*? bas only one member, A$:L and beyond are empty.

C.2 Compatibility, belief and plausibility Provided that the symptoms for a patient is P =  [0.2,0.38]/B + [0.30,0.35]/E + [0.3,0.4]/BE. We try to find the compatibility he may suffer a disease d = [0.5,0.6]/B + [0.8,0.9]/E + [0.3,0.4]/F. From the given data, a possible U?S over which Comp(d,F) # 0 are [0.2,0.38], [0.3,0.35] and [0.3,0.4]. Thus, Comp ( d , F ) {[0.2,0.38]} = [0.5,0.6]; Comp ( d , F )  {[0.3,0.35]} = I.8, .9]; and Comp ( d , F )  {[.3, ,411 = 0.

To find the belief and plausibility of our fuzzy decision, we need to calculate the mass for each of large itemsets first. From the definition of mass, we have: m(A) = [.12,.22], m(B) = [.16,.29], m(C) = [.16,.27], m(E) = 1.16, ,311, and m(BE) = [.14,.26]. We also have: I(A c d)  = 0, I(B C d)  = [.5, .6], I(C C d)  = 0, I(BE C d)  = 0, and I(E c d)  = [.8,.9]. So, Bel(d) = [.21,.45].

For the plausibility, we have: J(A#d) = 0, J (B#d)  = [ .5 ,  .SI, J(C#d) = 0, J(E#d) = 1.8, .9], and J (BE#d) = 0. So, Pls(d) = [.21, ,451.

In this sample application the Bel(d) and Pls(d) have the same value, hut in generally they will yield different results.

The supports for all 1-itemsets are:

IV. Association Analysis Using Body of Evidence  A. Motivation  One problem in the application of fuzzy logic to decision making systems is the determination of relevant mem- bership functions. Sometimes experts can not agree on which value or interval should be assigned. I t  makes more sense to ask each expert to give a lower and upper bound on the membership values. This naturally leads to the concept of ?body of evidence?. Early research on body of evidence can be found in [SI. A body of evidence is  a function from the input space into a finite set of in- tervals I; with probability p ;  (pi  denotes the fraction of experts voting for I; to be the membership interval). Let us use Bi to denote the body of evidence that represents symptom s present in patient i in our sample applica- tion. Then, B: is a collection of intervals [a:i, b:,] with associated probability p:, where r p : ;  = 1.

r With this in mind, we can have a symptom set of our  sample application as follows:  Table 3.

One option to analyze this case is to reduce the body  of evidence to a single interval hy taking the ?average? interval. We take a different approach here.

B. Deriving association rule in body of evidence  B.l  Finding large itemset  Corresponding to B6, we have membership inter- vals [a:,, b:,] with associated probability p:,. If T is a threshold for large itemsets, we denote the degree for which the interval [a:,, b 3  exceeds T as g(s, i, T ,  T ) .  We now define the extent to which ?B; exceeds e? by the - fuzzy set: c p ? J g ( s ,  i, T,  7 )  where E? specifies over g(s, i ,  T ,  T )  2 e. Now extending the concept of how large a 1-itemset is from the previous section, we define L(sk, e)  r  as:  (17)  Note that 0 I L(sk ,e )  I 1. A natural definition on how large of a 2-itemset is:  L((sk,sd,e) = L ( s k , e )  nL(s l ,e )  (18)  Proceeding inductively in the same way, we can define how large an n-itemset of {SI, s2,. . . , sn} is. First, we need a third parameter (in additional to T and e) named 7. The fuzzy set of large item sets of symptoms can then be defined by:  L = L ( X ,  e)/x (19) X  where E* is over L ( X ,  e) 2 7 and X is a subset of S.

0-7803-7280-8/02/$10.00 02002 IEEE 522    Thus the universe of discourse of C are subsets of S un- der consideration ?larger than 11?. Thus, from a dataset of interval valued body of evidence, we can determine the large m-itemset A!:!~.

B.2 Compatibility, belief and plausibility  Let d = S i ( D , ) / S ,  be a possible fuzzy consequent  which means the set of S, indicates the presence of d with body of evidence D a .  In the spirit of previous sections, we would l i e  to define: Comp(d,C)(u) for 0 5 U 5 1 as  Si  Comp(d,C)(u) = sup d(Si) (20) S,/C(S+?  informally. Thus, the compatibility of d with C has {L(S,, d) /S i  E sets of symptoms} as support and Comp(d, L)[L(Si, e ) ]  = sup {Dc}. The last  step is to define ?supcEH{&}? where H is an arbitrary set.

If we assume that all the probabilities involved are in- dependent then sup {&} can be defined as a body of  evidence as I U c e ~ a ,  , U c E ~ b > C ]  with associated probb  C/C(C,e)=L(S* ,e)  Tc I~  hility nccHprC.

We now consider how to define functions in the mesent  setting, somewhat similar to plausibility and belief. Our first step is to define a mass for any set X in the support of L. m ( X )  = the sum is over all sets C in the support of L. Note Ex m(X) = 1.

Now we need define J(z#d), the extent to which ? the set of X intersects disease d?. If d was a fuzzy set, the ?largest intersection? of the set X with d would be supzEx d(x). In our setting, the value of d at Si is the body of evidence S,(Ds,). If d was a regular set, the plau- sibility of d would be defined by: Pls(d) = m ( X ) .

In our setting we would like to count ?large itemsets in- tersecting 8?. It is therefore natural to define:  CC L(C, e )  XndZ0  The term ~ u p ~ , , ~ + ~ { S ~ ( D s , ) }  is a body of evi- dence with intervals [a;, b k ]  with probability p k  (the sup of a family of body of evidence has been d e fined earlier in this section). Thus the intervals  a k m ( X ) ,  b t m ( X )  define Pls(d) as a body of k XEC I evidence and associated probability p k .

in the present setting as: Similar considerations lead to the definition of belief

V. Conclusion and future work In this paper, we have defined ?large itemsets? in asso-  ciation analysis for each of the following cases in increas- ing complexity:  The compatibility is a fuzzy subset of [OJ], and the belief and plausibility are scalars.

The compatibility is defined on intervals and is in- terval valued. The belief and plausibility are defined on fuzzy sets and are interval valued.

The compatibility of two fuzzy sets is a body of evi- dence as are the belief and plausibility.

We also generate functions somewhat similar to com- patibility, belief and plausibility for each of the above cases. These functions are central in studying uncer- tainty in data and in making inference when information is vague and/or inaccurate.

In future, we would like to analyze the interplay among belief, plausibility and compatibility along the lines sim- ilar to what is described in [7]. Also, we will look at interplay between body of evidence and the above func- tions along lines similar to [9]. Finally, we will look at rules involving fuzzy sets of type I1 as described in [3] and analyze the possible relations of how these rules are fired with the functions introduced in this paper.
