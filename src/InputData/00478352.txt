DATABASE MINING IN THE NORTHERN IRELAND HOUSING EXECUTTVE  Ian C Magill, Mee G Tan, Sarabjot S Anand, David A Bell, John G Hughes  Introduction  In this paper we describe some work being carried out by the Database Mining Research GrouppMRG] within the School of Information and Software Engineering, at the University of Ulster. Jordanstown. In particular we outline how we have been investigating the use of data mining techniques on data sets from the Northern Ireland Housing Executive[NME].

NIHE are responsible for the management of the public sector housing stock within Northern Ireland. They are the largest such body within the European Union, and are acknowledged as leaders within their field in the use of idonnation technology.

WithinNlHEthere are numerous databases muse. These fBl1 into two main categories. There are the day to day, operational databases such as the Prawl rent accounting system and the Repairs maintenance management system. Such databases are used both for transaction processing and management information purposes. The other main category of database in use are the various data sets used by the Research Department. These are used for analysis that feeds into the formulation of policy. An example of such a data set is the five-yearly House Condition Survey. This is generated by a survey of a sample of approximately 10,000 properties across Northem Ireland. For each property up to 4,000 attributes are surveyed.

With such a large and growing amount of data within their organisaton, NIHE are interested in techniques that will help them make better use of it. To this end, they have agreed to collaborate with the DMRG in testing the use of data mining techniques on their data.

It was decided in the Grst instance to use the House Condition Survey data set mentioned above as the target data set. Several data mining techniques being explored by the DMRG are being evaluated using this data.

The techniques in question are algorithms for the discovery of classification and association rules. We are also interested in sequential or temporal rules but OUT work on this is less advand.

Classification Rules  This involves flndmg rules that partition data into disjoint groups. For example, consider the problem of tenant placement. We require rules involving neighbourhood and tenant attributes that predict the value of the attribute for length of tenure. If the length of tenure attribute can take the values long, average and short, we might discover the following rule.

ifestate-type = D and retail-fkilities = nearby and public_tranport_access = g o d and no-of-children = 0 and temnt-age > 55 and tenant_car_owners = no then length-of-tenure = tong  Our classification algorithm is based on an existing techique [AGRA92]. We are attempting some enhancements to this in the areas of performance and handlmg of noisy data.

Association @des  A m o r e p e d  rule relabng items within P database is called an association rule. Classification rules are a particular type of association d e  in which the rule has a single consequent attribute.

The following is an example of an association rule.

ifdiStriCt=BT7 and unemployed = No and car-owner = yes then heating-type = oil and prop-value > 50000 andgarage=yes strength = 0.91, support = 0.01  Each such rule bas a strength value and a support d u e .

- The strength value specifies the validity of the rule, ie. the proportion of cases in which the anteadent implies the consequent.

- The support value is the fraction of the database to which the rule applies.

We have been developing two distinct algorithms for discovering association rules. One approach generalises an existing algorithm[AGRA93], so that it handles multivalued attribute types. The other approach is a novel parallel technique based on the mathematical theory of evidence[A"95].

Objectives  The DMRG has set itself two main objectives for its work. The first objective is to devise improved data mining algorithms, in particular for mining classification and association rules.

Some of the areas of improvement being investigated are :  - More efficient algorithms.

- Widening the scope of algoritbms.

- b d h g  of noisy data.

- Incorporation of prior lmowledge into algorithms.

- Measures of interestingness.

The second objective is to evaluate our algorithms on real world data sets, where real world implies:  - Very large databases.

- Databases with many tabIes, many attributes and many attribute types.

- Noisy data, missing and inaccurate data values.

The HCS data set fulfils the above requirements.

Mining Kernel System  To facilitate our work on data mining algorithms we have designed and built a database mining tookit, the M d K e m e l  System, or MKS.

MKS is a toolkit for implementing and evaluating database mining algorithms. It is intended primarily as a workbench for investigating algorithms, but can also be considered a research prototype for a database mining system.

MKS has two main features :  - A set of flexible components for buildmg algorithms. Most algorithms have common components so we avoid duplicating effort.

- Flexible access to a variety of databases. This allows us to work easily with any data set from a relational database.

The virtual view mechanism of MKS allows users to create a virtual dataspace on which to apply their data mining algoritbms. The space takes the form of a relation. The attributes that make up the relation can be mapped to a variety of underlying relational databases. The mapping between the attributes of a view and the attributes of the underlying data source is specified in a view definition text file. The view mechanism enabl& any data in a relational  8/3    database to be brought into a standard memon data structure by simply creating a view definition text file.

Initial results  The MKS toolkit has been completed and the three algorithms described above have been i m w e n t e d  with its facilities. Initial trials of the algorithms using t h w C S  data set are taking pia& mith a formal data mining study scheduled to take place in February.

The initial m a l s  suggest that the performance of the algorithms is reasonably linear with respact to the number of tuples processed, but much less so with respect to both the number of atmbutes and the number of attribute values. Also clear at this stage is the problem of imcrprctauon of the very large number uf rules that be generated ifthe algorithms are not connralncd to particular target rules.
