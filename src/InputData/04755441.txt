Service quality?s impact on mobile satisfaction and intention to use 3G service

Abstract Third generation of mobile technology (3G), being an instantaneous communication medium, is related to mobile commerce (MC) and this has grown rapidly and spread around the globe. IT researchers often place their focus on users? acceptance and its antecedents. Yet factors that influence satisfaction in MC are rarely seen. Viewing 3G service as a mobile technology, this paper has applied technology acceptance model (TAM), coupled with other service quality factors in relation to 3G service from literature that play roles in influencing user?s satisfaction, to empirically test users? perceptions on using 3G service.

The proposed model was evaluated by using data collected from an online survey of 212 3G users. While the tests of internal consistency and validity indicate all scales being reliable and valid, results reveal that users? behavioral intention to use 3G service is influenced by satisfaction and trust. Yet customization, usefulness and ease-of-use were shown to have significant explanatory power in predicting users? satisfaction. This study offers a unique contribution to the mobile communication research by providing empirical evidence of users? perception of service quality.

1. Introduction   Second generation (2G) refers to a cell-phone network and is a wireless mobile technology that is digital instead of analog (1G). Unlike 2G that can only transfer textual data and voice with limited bandwidth, third generation (3G) mobile technology provides a much faster speed for on-line and real-time information data transfer regardless of time and place. Users with 3G technology-embedded phone can send an electronic greeting card with images, have a live video communication connected from two places apart with their relatives, and stay active in on-line commerce activities with their phones. While these services are regarded as 3G service, this interactive feature may be one of the most appealing functions to mobile phone users and also creates a profit opportunity for mobile network operators. Researchers often refer this type of commerce as mobile commerce (MC) [32, 33, 59].

According to a Taiwan Economic News report in June 2003 [55], the number of mobile phone subscribers in Taiwan had a penetration rate of 102.5%. Taking this phenomenon as an advantage, mobile network operators are putting effort into encouraging their customers to use 3G service. For mobile network operators, customer relationship management (CRM) is an important issue. What makes CRM difficult are that users are neither satisfied with 3G service nor aware of the utilities that can be gained by using 3G service. According to Lee and Benbasat [32], poor service quality can be one of the reasons contributing to the growth slower than predicted. Profitability for mobile network operators lies with the number of users. To maintain the users? satisfaction is to provide the satisfactory service quality. Strategies must be based on 3G users? behavior pattern and thus develop a profit-generating model accordingly.

Many researchers have widely explored the research topics in mobile commerce context [21, 22, 31, 33, 36].

They tried to validate the antecedents that affect the users? adoption of 3G service and to determine the loyalty and trust?s formation process towards mobile commerce context. However, little attention has been put on what aspects could be utilized to comfort 3G users, to improve 3G users satisfaction, and, in turn, to influence their behavioral intention to use 3G service.

It seems intuitively logical that there should be a causal link between service quality, satisfaction, trust, and behavioral intention in 3G context. Thus, it becomes our primary concern to investigate service quality that plays a role in affecting 3G users? satisfaction. We believe that with an increased customer satisfaction, the behavioral intention to use 3G service as well as the trust towards using 3G service will also increase.

2. Conceptual background &hypotheses development   The following literature review in the context of mobile commerce is to ensure that comprehensive measures are included. Relevant constructs and related measures in literature are identified and discussed, followed by the proposed hypotheses.

To examine the customers? satisfaction in MC context, an exploratory study is conducted that involves five antecedents of satisfaction: interactivity, customization, responsiveness, usefulness and ease-of- use. These constructs will be individually discussed.

Behavioral intention to use 3G service in this framework is recognized as repeated use after the initial use. To understand how future repeated use of 3G service is influenced, we also discuss the roles of trust combined with satisfaction. Among these constructs, antecedents of satisfactions affects behavioral intention to use 3G service directly after the initial use, while trust affects behavioral intention in the absence of direct experience. Essentially, trusting belief can be enhanced from other users? experience.

Interactivity has many definitions; depending on how it is looked and in what context it is measured.

Rice [49] defined interactivity as the information exchange behavior enabled by the computer-embedded communication system. McMillan and Hwang [38] categorized interactivity on features, process, or perception. To measure interactivity in online environment, Ha and James [17] suggested interactivity in the fulfillment of communication needs and should be 5-dimensional: playfulness, choice, connectedness, information collection and reciprocal communication.

In mobile commerce environment, Lee [33] defined mobile interactivity as continuance of mobile commerce activities irrespective of users? time and location and conceptualized mobile interactivity as 6 dimensional: user control, responsiveness, personalization, connectedness, ubiquitous connectivity and contextual offer. Based on these review of literature, interactivity, which can be perceived as a quality dimension [62, 35], will be primarily focused on ubiquitous connectivity and textual offer in this study because they fulfill the characteristics of mobile service. In the marketing field, the improved service quality positively influences the level of satisfaction [9]. Thus, it is hypothesized that:  H1. Interactivity directly and positively affects the satisfaction of using 3G service.

Customization refers to tailoring ability enhanced by  users? mobile setting [32] and can be used to enhance the mobile interface design and to improve mobile usability [61]. In e-commerce context, customization means to satisfy customers? need and results in customer satisfaction. Thus, in a MC context, the existing evidence suggests that customization is associated with improvement of service quality. Thus, it is hypothesized that:   H2. Customization directly and positively affects the satisfaction of using 3G service.

Responsiveness in the e-commerce context relates to  speedy feedback [7], responsiveness to the user [18] and immediacy of feedback [30]. In IS field, responsiveness is one of dimensions in SERVQUAL, proposed by Parasuraman, Zeithaml and Berry [43, 44, 45]. Based on Jiang, Klein and Crampton [24], SERVQUAL has drawn the attention from researchers and market practitioners not only as a measure but also as a diagnostic tool for uncovering uncovering areas of service quality strengths and shortfalls [26, 27, 28, 46, 58, 59].

Accordingly, responsiveness in this study refers to the willingness or readiness of employees to help customers and provide prompt service. Precisely, it is the response probability and speed. In general, the researchers above treat responsiveness in relation to service quality. In the marketing literature, service quality is long known as an antecedent of customer satisfaction [4, 55]. Thus, it is expected that:  H3. Responsiveness directly and positively affects the satisfaction of using 3G service.

Usefulness and ease-of-use are the two vital  elements in technology acceptance model (TAM) [6].

In TAM, behavioral intention to use is jointly influenced by attitude and usefulness, where the latter affects the former directly. Moreover, ease-of-use directly influences usefulness and attitude. In general, TAM functions to explain and predict individual acceptance of IT.

According to Davis [6], these two factors influence the individual attitude towards using the system. It is closely related to the acceptance of computer technologies [6, 60] and is of great importance for new users [13]. In the mobile service quality context, to measure the service quality, usefulness and ease-of-use are modified to include aspects such as effectiveness and immediateness of purpose fulfillment, skill of using 3G service and degree of easiness of utilizing 3G service. Based on the review of empirical evidence, usefulness and ease-of-use can elicit positive impact on satisfaction [48]. As customers encounter a well- designed interface, the reduced effort will result in a higher satisfaction of using such service. Thus, it can be expected that:  H4. Usefulness directly and positively affects the satisfaction of using 3G service.

H5. Ease-of-use directly and positively affects the satisfaction of using 3G service.

H6. Ease-of-use directly and positively affects the usefulness.

Variables of interactivity, customization,  responsiveness, usefulness and ease-of-use all together are treated as factors of service quality.   Among these factors, a modified TAM was included to test its extended influence on the level of satisfaction. In addition, responsiveness, derived from PZB?s SERVQUAL model, was included to enhance our understanding of service users? behaviour. Moreover, to accommodate mobile characteristics such as ubiquitous connectivity and localization, interactivity was included. Finally, customization, playing a role in satisfying customers? need, was included as a measure to test customers? satisfaction.

Trust refers to the willingness to rely on an exchange partner in whom one has confidence [34]. While trust?s main goal is to create a stable relationship in all normal day-to-day business operations [54], trust is an essential element in e-business [11, 37] and is generally needed in every buyer-seller relationship to facilitate the business transaction [54]. With trust, companies can increase the acceptance of newly marketed product [16].

Moreover, trust has been validated to predict the attitude towards purchasing in an online environment.

In a MC environment, trust can be perceived as consumers? perceptions of particular attributes of m- vendors, including the ability, integrity and benevolence of the vendors when handling the consumers? transactions [29].

In accordance with Lee [33], we adopt the definition of trust in mobile environment as follows: trust is the belief that allows consumers to willingly become vulnerable to mobile Internet site after having taken the Internet site?s characteristics into consideration. In analogy with these findings, it may be reflected that 3G-service users? trust is expected to increase the behavioral intention to use the 3G service. Thus, it is hypothesized that:  H7. Trust directly and positively affects the behavioral intention to use 3G service.

Based on Casalo, Flavian and Guinaliu [3], satisfaction can be defined as an affective consumer condition that results from a global evaluation of all the aspects that make up the consumer relationship [53].

According to Geyskens, Steenkamp and Kumar [14], satisfaction can be raised by economic conditions (e.g.

monetary benefits) or psychological factors (e.g.

promises fulfillment or ease of relationships with retailers). In this study, satisfaction will concentrate on attitudinal psychological aspects that reflect satisfaction from using 3G service.

Researchers often refer customer satisfaction as the antecedent of trust [10]. Past study validated a positive effect of satisfaction on trust in the on-line environment [42]. In addition, Zeithaml, Berry and Parasuraman [63] suggested the variable of behavioral intention is the best indication of customer satisfaction.

Thus, it can be expected that in a MC environment:  H8. Satisfaction directly and positively affects the trust toward using 3G service.

H9. Satisfaction directly and positively affects the behavioral intention to use 3G service.

Figure 1 summarizes the stated hypotheses. The research model attempts to understand two issues. One is to find the influential factors generated from the literature in relation to 3G users? satisfaction and the other is to investigate the impact of mobile users? perceptions of task quality on their acceptance of use of 3G service. The model treats the trust as mediating factor of the relationship. It is expected that the components of service quality will affect the mobile users? trust and satisfaction, and, in turn, influence the behavioral intention towards the use of 3G related services.

Research model   3. Research methodology  3.1. Data collected   Research questions were examined by experienced users of 3G devices. Then, empirical data were collected by conducting an internet-based online (www.my3q.com) survey during the period February 2008 to April 2008. Experienced subjects with 3G devices were induced by the offer of twenty randomly selected movie tickets that will be mailed based upon the address provided. To enhance the data      representativeness, same survey was also posed on mobile communication-related campus BBS boards in Taiwan during the same period. Online questionnaire has numerous advantages as suggested by Tan and Teo [56]. For instance, they can elicit faster responses either geographically or demographically. According to Hsu and Lu [20], such method has been widely used in recent years. With regard to the participants, those who have wireless handheld devices (e.g. PDA, smart phone, 3G technology-embeded cell phone) can be our potential subject. Participants who visited the hyperlink were first confronted by a message stating the purpose of this study and the contribution of this questionnaire based on academic field. Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics of participants.

The online survey yielded 212 valid responses. 46 % were male, and 54% were female; 45% claimed using 3G-embeded cell phone, 34% using PDA phone, and 21% using smart phone. The following table summarized the results.

Measure development   Previous literature was reviewed to ensure a comprehensive list of measures. Components of quality in MC were interactivity, customization, responsiveness, usefulness and ease-of-use [33, 25, 48, 6, 44, 45]. The constructs for satisfaction, trust, and  behavioral intention were adapted from Lin & Wang [36], Hsu, Lu & Hsu [22] and Heijden, Verhagen & Creemers [19].

The questionnaire, made up from the review of literature, consisted of 21 items measuring 8 latent variables (See Appendix A). Pilot test, involving 50 subjects, was conducted to ensure the clarity of content and the appropriateness of aspects. An item in the construct of responsiveness was deleted during the pilot test. In addition, the questionnaire had two parts.

The first recorded subjects? demographic information, while the second asked the subjects to indicate their degree of agreement with each item, which was measured on a five-point Likert scale, ranging from ?strongly disagree? (1) to ?strongly agree? (5).

An exploratory factor analysis with a varimax rotation (using SPSS 13.0) was performed on eight factors that correspond to the 9 hypotheses. Table 2 in Appendix B shows the rotated factors with variables properly loaded onto their respective constructs.

Proportion of total variance explained by the 8 constructs is 78% and Kaiser?s measure of sampling adequacy, 075, indicates that variables included in the analysis were reasonably correlated.

3.3. Initial internal consistency   The internal consistency was determined by calculating Cronbach?s alpha. The Cronbach?s alpha for interactivity (3 items, alpha=0.84), responsiveness (2 items, alpha=0.73), behavioral intention (2 items, alpha=0.82), satisfaction (2 items, alpha=0.85), trust (3 items, alpha=0.80), customization (3 items, alpha=0.86), ease-of-use (3 items, alpha=0.78) and usefulness (2 items, alpha=0.76) imply that measurements of these variables were reliable. Based on Cronbach [5] and Nunnally [40, 41], an alpha value with a minimum of 0.7 can be accepted as reliable.

Table 3. Cronbach?s Alpha  Construct Mean SD Alpha Interactivity 3.44 0.71 0.84 Responsiveness 3.57 0.70 0.73 Customization 3.35 0.73 0.86 Usefulness 3.25 0.71 0.76 Ease-of-use 3.38 0.68 0.78 Satisfaction 3.42 0.88 0.85 Trust 3.42 0.77 0.80 Behavioral intention  3.59 0.74 0.82   4. Results and analysis  4.1. Analysis tool       To test the proposed hypotheses, data were collected  and analyzed by using the structural equation modeling (SEM), a second-generation multivariate technique that combines multiple regressions with confirmatory factor analysis to estimate simultaneously a series of interrelated dependence relationships. SEM has received its popularity in several fields including marketing, psychology, social science and information systems [23, 39, 52].

Results of SEM include two components: the measurement model and the structural model. The measurement model, giving relationships between the latent variables and observed variables, aims to provide the internal consistency and validity based on these variables. The structural model, on the other hand, studies the path strengths and the direction of the relationships among the latent variables.

4.2. The measurement model  A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) using AMOS 5.0 was conducted to test the measurement model.

Seven model-fit measures were employed to assess the model?s overall goodness of fit: the ratio of X2 to degrees-of-freedom (d.f.), goodness-of-fit index (GFI), adjusted goodness-of-fit index (AGFI), comparative fit index (CFI), norm fit index (NFI), root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) and root mean square residual (RMR). See Table 6 in Appendix B for detailed results. Overall, goodness-of-fit for the model was met, following the suggested cut-off value guideline except NFI. NFI was 0.88, which is slightly below the suggested cut-off value of 0.9. After the overall model was accepted, we proceed to evaluate the psychometric properties of the measurement model in terms of reliability, convergent validity and discriminant validity.

Reliability and convergent validity were estimated by the composite reliability and average variance extracted, respectively (See Table 4). Composite reliability for all factors in our measurement model was well above 0.8. Average extracted variances were all above 0.5, which meant that more than one-half of the variances observed in the items were accounted for by their hypothesized factors. Both results satisfied the recommended values [15]. Moreover, convergent validity can also be evaluated by examining the factor loadings. Following Hair, Anderson, and Tatham [15], the factor loadings in our model were all above 0.7, indicating a convergent validity. After all, all factors in the measurement model revealed adequate reliability and convergent validity. Note that the following formula the calculation for the composite reliability:  ( ) ( ) ( )   :  Var C  i  i  i  CR i  ? ?  ? ? =  + .

In words, the composite reliability equals the square of the summation of the factor loadings divided by the sum of the square of the summation of the factor loadings and the summation of error variances.

To examine discriminant validity, we compared the squared correlations between constructs and variance extracted for a construct [8]. The results showed that the square correlations for each construct is less than the average variance extracted (AVE) by the indicators measuring that construct, as shown in Table 5. The formula for AVE is given by the following formula:  ( ) ( ) ( )   i  AVE : Var  i  V  i i  ? ?  ? ? =  + .

Equally stated, AVE equals the summation of the square of the factor loadings divided by the sum of the summation of the square of the factor loadings and the summation of error variances.

Test of structural model  Table 6 showed the structural model?s overall goodness-of-fit. The values overall provided evidence of a good model fit (X2/df=1.26, GFI=0.91, AGFI=0.88, CFI=0.98, NFI=0.89, RMSEA=0.035 and RMR=0.039). Thus, we could proceed to examine the path coefficients.

Figure 2 presents the results with non-significant path as a dotted line and the standardized path coefficients between the proposed constructs.

Hypothesis 1 to 8 but Hypothesis 9 was supported and statistically significant at different confident level.

Users? satisfaction was significantly influenced by the proposed quality dimensions. The path coefficients from the quality factors all together explained approximately 33% of variance in the observed variance in satisfaction. Thus, Hypotheses 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 were supported. Moreover, users? behavioral intention to use 3G service was significantly influenced by satisfaction and trust. The path coefficients of satisfaction and trust accounted for approximately 22% of observed variance in behavioral intention to use 3G service. Thus, Hypotheses 7 and 8 were supported.

Note that Hypothesis 9 did not receive any significant statistical support.

Consistent with our expectations, the modified TAM fits well by the path coefficient of 0.49. Thus, Hypothesis 6 was supported.

Non-significant path   Figure 2. Structural model   While trust, as a mediator, has a significant  influence on the dependent variable (i.e. behavioral intention), it is interesting to decompose the effects on the dependent variable into the direct effect and indirect effect. We rely on the bootstrap re-sampling method by setting the number of bootstraps equal to 1000 times and the confidence interval set at 95 % [47].

The results are listed in the following table.

Table 7. Effects on behavioral intention to use 3G service Construct Direct  effects Indirect effects  Total effects  Satisfaction 0.23 0.04 0.27  5. Discussion and implication   Motivated by the need to understand the formation of satisfaction, we conducted an online survey to empirically investigate proposed factors affecting user satisfaction of using 3G service with wireless handheld devices.  One of the main contributions was that we found that factors of interactivity, responsiveness, customization, usefulness and ease-of-use significantly affected the satisfaction. While testing the variables of trust and satisfaction that influence behavioral intention to use 3G service, another contribution was to realize satisfaction having an existing casual relationship between trust and behavioral intention.

Most importantly, satisfaction was validated as the antecedent of behavioral intention to use 3G service.

Although satisfaction was shown to influence behavioral intention to use 3G service, satisfaction also exerts its influential power indirectly through the mediating variable, trust, impacting on a higher behavioral intention. Practically, this result implies that building a trust relationship between users and network operators may be as important as finding ways to improve users? satisfaction. Moreover, trust was shown to be an important research issue in mobile commerce.

Previous research showed that trust building in mobile commerce can be enhanced through the factors of users? perceptions of service quality such as site quality, business competence and security issues that arise from conducting business activities [50, 51]. Our model lent support to this trust building concept.

However, trust, in our observations, did not influence behavioral intention to use 3G service. This may be due to the reason that indirect experiences (ex. word- of-mouth) were not treated as good way to determine the intention to use 3G service.

Several implications for market practitioners are raised. At first, understanding how satisfaction is built and improved is important for 3G operators because higher satisfaction with service provided may result in a greater customer base. Secondly, service quality factors such as interactivity, customization and responsiveness play keys to improve the satisfaction towards the use of 3G service. Thus, 3G operators should provide an interactive and customized mobile online environment for users especially for their first time use. Thirdly, service feedback is attention demanding. Users need the readily response from 3G service providers when they encounter usage problems.

A major practical implication of this study lies with verifying ease-of-use and usefulness to be another two important factors affecting users? satisfaction. This finding implies that mobile software must be based on users? needs. Interface design and the constraints of mobile devices are especially of great importance.

Furthermore, higher satisfaction refers to the attitude change, which may lead to the behavioral intention to      use the service.  Thus, operators should concern more on the obstacles or barriers that may distract or degenerate users? attitude towards the satisfaction level.

Lastly, satisfaction for the behavioral intention to use the service through trust has significant impact. Thus, 3G service operators should concern on providing a trustable service that does exert a persuasive influence.

The implication for research suggests that an examination of proposed service quality measurement may provide insights into the causality relationship with satisfaction. This would be the case for explaining why the combined quality factors have statistically significant effect on satisfaction and behavioral use decisions.

One of limitations of this study lies with the source of the data. The statistically significant result of satisfaction?s impact on behavioral intention to use 3G service may not be applicable to 3G service providers in other countries. Another limitation would be that we might have omitted other as important factors as ones that affect service satisfaction in this study. Thus, the proposed satisfaction measurement may not possess the sole right to reflect satisfaction.

For the future work, we may pay attention to improve R-square. This can be done by exploring and investigating hedonic factors. Factors that can improve the quality of service can be seen as hedonic such as mobile connectivity and mobile enjoyment. Besides, it is interesting to investigate cognitive factors. Factors of cognition refer to the mental process of viewing the service such as expectancy of satisfaction confirmation.

Furthermore, a slightly modified version of TAM was included in our framework. Despite being an important indicator of satisfaction, extensive research has shown the consequences induced by TAM. Thus, it remains interesting to investigate the antecedents of usefulness and ease-of-use in 3G service context. Future researchers may investigate very specific quality of 3G service and their impacts on usefulness and ease-of-use so as to complement the fundamentals in 3G research issues.

6. Conclusion   Acceptance of 3G service is crucial for the growth of mobile commerce. This paper sheds light on the aspect of satisfaction that acts as a fundamental to influence the 3G service acceptance, thus suggesting service users be equally important to the business operation, compared to the 3G technology integration. Although communication technology facilitates the transaction activities, to 3G service providers, a well-designed service plan to accommodate users? need cannot be absent, which will be especially useful for the first time users as it affects their further service subscription.

After a satisfactory initial use, it becomes easy for service providers to promote further business service in mobile commerce.

In Taiwan, the mobile commerce is open to business opportunities for service providers. As more users subscribe the service and enter the market, the demand for the mobile service will continue to grow and take off. How to retain old users, attract new users and comfort existing users become important issues especially brand switching is a common practice in Taiwan. The results of this study suggest that by focusing and improving the service quality?s factors, service providers can achieve a better service satisfaction. In turn, higher satisfaction may help service providers either retain the old customers or attract new service subscribers.
