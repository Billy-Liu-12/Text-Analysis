Cassini Mission-to-Saturn Spacecraft Overview &

Abstract- In November 2016, the Cassini Mission-to-Saturn Spacecraft will enter a new mission regime, bringing the orbiter  closer to Saturn's gaseous surface than ever before. This unique  orbital profile will call for the vehicle to fly at very high speeds  in a ballistic trajectory with shorter orbits than previously  flown, within the vicinity of the "F" and "D" Rings of the  Saturn ian system. This mission phase is called the "F?  RinglProximal Orbit" segment where a close flyby of Saturn's  moon Titan will place the spacecraft in an orientation which  resides near the outside edge of Saturn's F-Ring, positioning the  vehicle in the proper flight path to complete the final 42 orbits  of Cassini's mission. After 20 F-Ring orbits, a second close flyby  of Titan will place the spacecraft between the innermost D-Ring  and Saturn, where it will continue to collect new and unique  science data for the remaining 22 orbits, before a third and final  distant flyby of this moon alters Cassini's flight path to an  impact trajectory with Saturn's surface, plunging the vehicle  into the planet's atmosphere and ending the spacecraft's very  successful 20-year miSSIOn, on September 15, 2017.

Environmental assessments indicate that the D-Ring contains a  significantly higher dust level than previously encountered by  the spacecraft, while the F-Ring contains relatively little dust.
