On The Need Of Kurtosis-based Technique To Evaluate The Fatigue Life Of A Coil  Spring

Abstract? Automotive suspension systems have big potential of mechanical failure due to fatigue as this system was subjected to the variable amplitude loading under service condition. This study was specifically focuses on coil spring, one of the suspension system parts. When vehicle was driven on any road surfaces and hit potholes or bump, this coil spring is then affected by the significant load. This significant load will cause the damage to this component. The objective of this study to predict the coil spring fatigue damage and then relate it with the I-kaz coefficient, results from a new statistical-based method, I-kaz method. The signal captured from this repeated loading was known as fatigue signal. The car was driven on three different roads, highway, country road and damage- surface road. The strain gauges were mounted on the outer surfaces of the coil spring to capture the fatigue load variable amplitude data on the road. The recorded strain was then analysed for fatigue damage and I-kaz coefficient purposes.

From the analysis, it was found that the damage road gives the highest fatigue damage rather than the other road and also the fatigue damage was proportionally related to the I-kaz coefficient.

I.  INTRODUCTION Automotives industry increasingly seeks to achieve  higher quality level for their vehicles. The vehicle components such as parts of engine, suspension and body structures has come to be required to be able to withstand increasingly higher stresses [1]. This study was focuses on the coil spring, one part of the suspension system as this system was directly experiencing the load when the vehicle driven over the road.

Generally, coil springs are desired to be resistant to high load, in particular, resistant to fatigue. Failure of a coil spring due to fatigue typically occurs through the crack initiation and propagation of cracks when subjected to the cyclic loading. Since fatigue is one of the major causes in vehicle component failure, its life prediction or fatigue damage has become a subject of discussion in many texts. So, it is really worthy if the detail causes of fatigue damage of the coil spring which is specific focuses on the types of road surfaces is studied. Different road surfaces give different amounts of the load to this component under service conditions. The significant amount of this load will give the significant strain to the coil spring.  From this displacement, fatigue life  assessment will come out in this study to predict the fatigue damage of the coil spring. The strain-life (?-N) is used for the analysis as the case study was related to the low cycle fatigue, which is a suitable approach to analyse random data collected from automotive components.

Another analysis to be performed for the purpose of this paper is the statistical analysis, which is a new statistical- based method, called Integrated Kurtosis-based Algorithm for Z-filter Technique, I-kaz. The I-kaz method calculates the related coefficient for the measured fatigue signal.  The input data of the I-kaz method was fatigue signal that was obtained from the road test. The damage for the signal was monitored by the value of the I-kaz coefficient, ?? and three dimensional graphic display of the magnitude distribution [2].

This work was assessing the fatigue damage of the coil spring when subjected to the variable amplitude loading and also the value of the kurtosis-based coefficient using the same fatigue signal. The goal is to determine   the correlation between fatigue damage and I-kaz coefficient of the coil spring. Thus, from the obtained results, the method of assessment of the fatigue damage can be done or not using the kurtosis-based method. Material fatigue properties were obtained from the Glyphworks? software. First the experimental procedure is described. Next the failure analysis, captured fatigue signal as the input to predict the fatigue damage for each of the road and the type of the road which will causes the most damages to this component. Then a statistical analysis as to obtain the kurtosis-based coefficient of the fatigue road signal.    Finally the comparative study is performed in order to determine the correlation of these two parameters and was discussed.



II. LITERATURE BACKGROUND  A. Fatigue Life Assesment Fatigue is a localised damage process of a component  produced by cyclic loading. It is the cumulative process consisting of crack initiation, propagation and final fracture of component. During cyclic loading, localised plastic deformation may occur at the highest stress site. This plastic deformation induces permanent damage to the component and a crack develops. As the component experiences an increasing number of loading cycles, the length of the crack (damage) also increases. After a certain number of cycles, the crack will cause the component to fail.

DOI 10.1109/ICSPS.2009.181     This suspension system component was important and feasible to predict crack initiation in order to avoid fatigue failure by removing the part from service at the appropriate time rather than analysed for fatigue life using crack growth approaches [3]. It is not suitable to apply the crack inspection process for inexpensive components that are made in large numbers as performing this periodic inspections on these components would generally increase the cost of the item [4].

The foundation of the strain-life approach is the Coffin- Manson relationship and it is defined as the following equation  ( ) cfNfbfNE f  a )2('2 '  ? ?  ? +=  (1)  In the real data application of the fatigue service loading, mean stress can have a substantial effect on the metallic fatigue behaviour. In this strain-life approach, two mean- stress effect models are commonly being used, i.e. the Morrow and the Smith-Watson-Topper (SWT) strain-life models. The Morrow?s strain-life model [5] is mathematically defined by  cfNf b  fN f  m E  f a )2(')2('  '  ? ? ??? +?  ?  ?  ?  ? ?  ?  ? ?=  (2)  The SWT strain-life model [6] is mathematically expressed by  cbfffbf f  a NNE ++= )2('')2(  )'( 2 max ??  ? ??  (3)  For all those three strain-life expressions, E is the material modulus elasticity, ?max is the true maximum stress, ?m is the mean stress, ?a is the true strain amplitude, 2Nf   is the number of reversals to failure, ?f? is the fatigue strength coefficient, b is the fatigue strength exponent, ?f? is the fatigue ductility coefficient and c is the fatigue ductility exponent. The Morrow?s strain-life model is significant at lower values of plastic strain and has little effect at higher plastic strains. For loading sequences that are predominantly in tensile, the SWT approach was recommended to be used for fatigue life estimation. In the case where the loading is predominantly compressive the Morrow approach can be used to provide more accurate life estimates [7].

The fatigue damage caused by each cycle is calculated by reference to material life curves, i.e. stress life (S-N) or strain life (?-N) curves. The Nf value for each cycle can be obtained from Equation (1) to (3) for all three models, and the fatigue damage value, D, for one cycle is calculated as  ? ?  ?  ?  ? ?  ?  ? =  fN D 1 (4)  The total damage caused by N cycles is referred to the Palmgren-Miner rule, for which the accumulated damage, ?D, is expressed as  ?D  = ? f  i N N. (5)  Where Ni is the number of cycles within a particular stress range and mean, and Nf is the number of cycles to failure for a particular stress range and mean. A fatigue cycle is defined as a closed loop on a cyclic stress-strain curve.

The fatigue damage is mainly related to cyclic amplitude, or ranges, and not to peak values.

B. Signal Analysis Behaviour A signal is a series of numbers that come from  measurement, typically obtained using some recording method as a function of time . In the case of fatigue analysis, the signal consists of a measurement of the cyclic loads, i.e.

force, strain and stress against time and measured signal is commonly consist of variation of amplitude, frequency, phase and energy. The objective of time series analysis is to determine the statistical characteristics of the original function by manipulating the series of discrete numbers [8].

In actual applications, mechanical signals can be classified to have a stationary or non-stationary behaviour. For nonstationary that is common for the fatigue analysis cases, however, the statistical parameter values of a signal are dependent to the time of measurement. In the case of nonstationary signals the global signal statistical values are dependent on the time of measurement [9].

The global signal statistics are frequently used to classify random signals and the most commonly used statistical parameters are the mean value, the standard deviation value, the root-mean-square (r.m.s.) value, the skewness and the kurtosis. Different types of the road will give the different statistical analysis results because fatigue signal patterns vary for each road. In this work, statistic analysis has been done using the I-kaz method, a new statistical-based method.

Based on kurtosis, I-kaz method provides a three dimensional graphical representation of the measured signal frequency distribution. The time domain signal has decomposed into three frequency bands,  which are x-axis, which is for low frequency (LF) range of 10-20 kHz, y-axis which is for high frequency (HF) range of 20-50 kHz and z- axis, which is for very high frequency (VF) range of 50-100 kHz. In order to measure the scatter of data distribution, the I-kaz coefficient calculates the distance of each data point from signal centroid [11]. I-kaz coefficient is defined as  ??  = vVHHLL sKsKsKn 4441 ++  (6)  Where n is the number of data, KL, KH, KV, are the kurtosis of signal in LF, HF and VF range and sL, sH and sV are the standard deviation of signal in LF, HF and VF range respectively. The standard deviation (?) for n data point is mathematically defined as     ?  =  2/1    )(1  ??  ? ? ?  ??  ? ? ?  ?? =  n  j j xxn  (7)  Kurtosis value was mathematically define as  K  = 4  4 )()..( 1 ?  =  ? n  j j xx  smrn (8)  Kurtosis, which is the signal 4th statistical moment, is a global signal statistic which is highly sensitive to the spikiness of the data. Higher kurtosis values indicate the presence of more extreme values than should be found in a Gaussian distribution. Kurtosis is used in engineering for detection of fault symptoms because of its sensitivity to high amplitude events [19].



III. METHODOLOGIES The input signal that was used in this study was a  variable amplitude (VA) strain loading, and it was sampled at 500 Hz for the 60 seconds record length. Thus, the time series of 30,000 data points was then produced. The arrangement of the actual data acquisition apparatus that was used in this data collection is shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2 shows the block diagram of the experimental process briefly.

The strain loading was measured using strain gauges of 2 mm size and this is shown in Figure 3. This figure presented the strain gauge position at the coil spring when the fatigue signal was measured. The fatigue data acquisition system, SoMat eDAQ Data Acquisition, was used for the fatigue strain data measurement as shown in Figure 1. The signal was measured on the front right coil spring of a car travelling over a highway and country road at the same velocity 70km/h, and damage-surface road at 40km/h. The uneven surface condition of the damage-surface road makes the car to drive slowly. The velocity differences of the car will not actually give the high effect since this work was focuses on the correlation between fatigue damage and kurtosis-based coefficient.

The selected material for the simulation testing purpose was the chromium steel, SAE5160. This material was chosen because it was commonly used to fabricate a coil spring for the vehicle suspension system. The material properties and their definitions are given in Table 1.

The GlyphWorks? software was used to calculate the fatigue damage of the coil spring and MATLAB? software was used to run this analysis as to obtain the I-kaz coefficient and three dimensional graphical representations of the captured fatigue signal which is obtained from the road test.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  A. Time Domain Signal The captured strain loading data was analysed in the time  domain signal plots. The original time domain signal for each types of the road were obtained, and their time histories are presented in Figure 4. It was show that the total strain amplitude or strain range for the highway, country road and damage-surface road were 541 microstrain, 590 microstrain and 981 microstrain, respectively.

The potholes and bumps along the road contributing to the spikiness of the fatigue data. This is can be seen at every signal, for example, the spikiness was observed at 15th  Strain gauge  Data acquisition  Data display  Strain gauge  Suspension system (Coil spring)     seconds for highway. At the same time, the spikiness phenomenon also occurs at the high amplitude compared to the other signal amplitude. From Figure 4 it can be seen that obviously damage-surface road experiencing the most spikiness from 32th to 52th seconds. This is because of the high amplitude loading transferred to the coil spring when the car travelling over that road.

B. Fatigue Damage Analysis Table 2 shows the results for the fatigue damage after  analysing using GlyphWorks?. This analysis was based on Coffin-Manson, Morrow and Smith-Watson-Topper (SWT) approaches. As for fatigue damage for the each approaches, damage-surface road give the highest fatigue damage and then followed by country road. The highway gives the lowest fatigue damage for the Coffin-Manson (CM), Morrow and SWT approach. The values of the fatigue damage can be referred in Table 2.

The damage road experiencing the shortest fatigue life although the velocity of the car was the lowest among the velocity on the other roads, because of the road surfaces that is physically not in well condition such as pothole and not uniform. They are too small distances between one pothole to another and also the uneven depth of the pothole. This gives the high strain when the car passes by the damage- surface road although the velocity of the car is 40km/h. So, this result were matching with the time domain signal that shown in the Figure 4, that shows the damage-surface road gives the highest strain amplitude range rather than the other road.

Country road which is driven at 70km/h gives the lower fatigue damage rather than highway which is also driven at  the same velocity.  Along country road, there are many bumps and potholes. These factors gave the significant load to the coil spring   when the car crosses over it. As for highway, the smooth surfaces make the coil spring did not experience much displacement compared to the damage and country road and this is related to the fatigue damage which is shown in Table 2, highway gives the lowest value for each,  CM, Morrow and SWT approaches, 0.00027 x 10-3, 0.00045 x 10-3 and 0.00066 x 10-3 respectively.

I-kaz Coefficient, ?? The I-kaz coefficient, ?? as shown in the Eq. (6) was  generated which measures the space of scattering of the I-kaz display. After doing the analysis using MATLAB?, the I- kaz Coefficient, ?? for each of the road were obtained and the results were shown in Figure 5.

From Figure 5, damage-surface road gives the highest ?? value that is 0.5413, then followed by country road, 0.3291 and the lowest ?? value is highway, 0.2179. In addition, it viewed clearly in the I-kaz display that the space of scattering of the frequency distribution was relatively going bigger when the ??value is bigger. It means that, the higher frequency present in the fatigue signal, the higher ?? value.

This is the reason for the biggest space of scattering for the damage-road surface. In order to do a comparative study, this ?? values show obviously that the higher value of ?? give the higher value of the fatigue damage as shown in Table 3.

This correlation was illustrated in Figure 6. From I-kaz coefficient versus log fatigue damage versus graph, it shows the proportional correlation between fatigue damage and I- kaz coefficient. The I-kaz coefficient was relatively higher when the fatigue damage is higher. This is actual for every approaches, CM, Morrow and SWT.Kurtosis and standard deviation value for highway, country road and damage road can be seen in Table 4. This is the statistical results obtained using Glyphworks software.  Refers to Table 4, kurtosis value for Country road was higher than damage road value.

This is happen because refers to Figure 4, country road was gave more spikiness or transient rather than damage road although the strain amplitude was lower compare to damage road. This is because kurtosis is highly sensitive to the spikiness of the data.

V. CONCLUSION This paper was discussed on the study of a fatigue  damage and relationship with I-kaz coefficient. The data collected from the coil spring of an automobile which was driven over highway, country road and damage road surface were used as the subject of this study. This comparative study shows that fatigue damage was proportionally related to the I-kaz coefficient. The reason behind this statement is fatigue damage has relationship with kurtosis and I-kaz coefficient was obviously based on kurtosis and standard deviation. This result shows that, fatigue damage determination can be evaluated either using strain-life approach or I-kaz method.
