I. INTRODUCTION Chinese medicine in two thousand years ago has  maintain that a healthy body must be four aspects : diet- regulating, living-regulating, emotion-regulating, work and rest -regulating [1], otherwise it will lead to the occurrence of disease. Physical fitness is a kind of objective existence of the phenomenon of life, is in the process of individual survival, in congenital and acquired basis, demonstrate the morphological structure, physiological function and psychological status and other aspects of comprehensive stable traits, and generally divided into Yin-deficiency type, Phlegm-wetness type, Yang-deficiency type etc. nine constitution [2]. In order to understand the influencing factors as well as the relationship between the physical effects on the body, in this study, living, eating, emotion, work and rest, the climate in the area as well as the WHO quality of life of WHOQOL - 100 scale [3] physiological function ( PF ) ( RP ), physiological function, somatic pain ( BP ), general health ( GH ), energy ( V ), social function (SF ), emotional functions ( RE ) and mental health ( MH ) as the main factor of the object, constructing neural network model[4]-[8], reveal their" super quantization" relationship, and propose a new aggregation algorithm of association rules data mining.



II. BASED ON THE C ROSS ENTROPY TRAINING OF  THE NEURAL NETWORK CONSTRUCTION  The neural network includes an input layer, hidden layer, the output layer, the basic principle is to give each neuron of a plurality of input P and corresponding connection weights  in W, and set a certain offset value B, weighted arithmetic through activation function ( transfer function ) f, get the neuron's output value. Through a set of input and output data of the training, constantly adjust the connection weights of W, in order to get in line with the requirements of the network. This set up physical impact factor set T, T = {T1 ( living ), T2 ( diet ), T3 ( emotion ) ... }, T neuronal input variables, set C to classification of constitution sets, C = {C1 (Yin-deficiency type), C2 ( Phlegm-wetness type ), C3 ( Yang-deficiency type) ... }, C neuron output variables, if the input layer to provide input variable group ( T1, T2, ..., Ti ), should be able to obtain output tuples ( C1, C2, ..., Ci ), when in the presence of Cj (1 j i ) = 1, and Ci 0 when i j , belonging to the class Cj. The present study neural network connection weights are modified using the gradient of the error function to adjust, in the hidden layer of the K node activation value ak f WkPk+bk , in which the vector Pk is ak 1 vector set, f is a nonlinear function, the hyperbolic tangent function f ( x ),  f ( x )=                                           (1)  the network finally the N node output Rn g WnPn+b n , and the function g ( x ),  g ( x )=                                          (2)  it can make the output node activation values in the range [0, 1], In the training algorithm, is introduced into the cross entropy as a function of the error, Wb, We said input nodes and hidden nodes is connected between the weight and the output node and hidden nodes between the connection weights, is constantly modify the connection weights, so that the error function ?(Wb We)=H1(Wb We)+ H2(Wb We) reaches a minimum value. Where u is the number of classes, 1 2 is a two positive weight attenuation coefficient. Their value reflects the network accuracy and complexity. The network training algorithm and gradient descent algorithm with the principle of consistency, when the gradient of ? ( Wb, We ) reaches a minimum value, the training end.

H1(Wb We)                                                                      (3) ___________________________________    H2(Wb We)  (4)   But in fact, the neural network" weights" although to a certain extent, can represent the physical factors and the relationship between its important degree, but as a result of these weights connected through continuous changes, will become overly quantization, namely the" super quantization", the discrete characteristic hinders the association rules mining, so we must use the new correlation algorithm for processing.



III. P OLYMERIZATION  PROCESS AND ALGORITHM  OF ASSOCIATION RULES  In the traditional sense of association rule[9] is an implication: X = > Y, X, Y included in I, and X Y= . The rule X = > Y in D, if D is S% combination of properties including XUY, and C% of D contains X property contains the Y. S for support, C for reliability. Mining association rules in database D is generated to meet the minimum support and confidence in the process of association rules.

This reference to" k-Nearest Neighbor" classification algorithm, put forward a kind of new polymerization association rules: setting minimum support Smin and minimum confidence Cmin  , and minimum sensitivity Vmin, set up a time in the training input node corresponding to the influence factors of di and dj, a training set size count ( D ), di and dj corresponding cosine similarity Scos (di and dj ) for:  Scos di,dj =                                                         (5)  wi ( d ) for the d associated with the network connection weights, the basic algorithm is as follows:  step (1): were calculated for each Scos (di,dj ), and all of the Scos tuple {Scos (di, d1 ), Scos (di, d2 ), Scos (di, d3 ) ... } clustering classification number", when Kn = Vmin clustering end.

step (2): for the same type of Scos classification Kj count count (Kj), which belongs to the calculation of Cj count count ( KCj ), The Support SVmin di,dj = count Kj / count D , The Support SVmin di,Cj = count KCj / count D ; if SVmin di,dj <=Smin,then reduce Vmin, and go to the step  (1).

step (3):calculated the confidence of di=>dj: as di=dj, reliability calculation of Scoss (dj,dj) = Scos (dj,dj ), all of the Scoss tuple cluster, when the classification number Kn< = Vmin, clustering end.

step (4): for the same type of Scoss classification Kp count count (Kp), which belongs to the calculation of Cj count count ( KpCj ), the confidence CVmin (di, dj ) = count ( Kj ) / count ( Kp ), the confidence CVmin (di,Cj ) = count ( KpCj ) / count ( Kp ), if CVmin di,dj <=Cmin, reduced Vmin, and go to the step (3).

step (5) :for more than two of the group, for example the group {di,dj,dk}, then Scos di,dj,dk = Scos di,dj * Scos di, dk * Scos dj,dk , then a similar operation step (1) to step (4), calculation of the corresponding SVmin  di,dj,dk and CVmin di,dj,dk  value.

Neural Network Training Extract 29 sub-health case from No.1 Affiliated Hospital  of Guangzhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, the physical form factor questionnaire input and the formation of physical form factor database. In checking the data integrity, consistency, noise, fill the missing data, remove the invalid data, the physical factors into 0 and 1 variables, and the neural network training, the network training curve as shown in figure 1:  Figure 1.   The Curve Of  Network Training  B. The Data Mining Process According to the aggregation algorithm of association  rules, for the same number of training data, to a group of T = {T2 ( diet ), T3 ( emotional ) } for example, in actual test got Kn, Vmin, count ( Kj ), count ( Kp ) data as shown in table 1:  TABLE 1.     T = {T2 ( diet ), T3 ( emotional ) }  SVmin Kn count Kj  count Kp  9 5 4 3  7 3 6 3  5 2 7 4    In group T = {T2 ( diet ), C2 ( phlegm-wetness type ) } for example, in actual test got Kn, Vmin, count ( KCj ), count ( KpCj ) data as shown in table 2:  TABLE 2.    T = {T2 ( diet ), C2 ( phlegm-wetness type ) }  According to the experimental data, where Vmin = 3, the high frequency of association rules as shown in table 3:  TABLE 3.  High Frequency Of Association Rules

V. ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION The data mining model combined with neural networks  and association rules, data mining provides a new train of thought, its basic principle is that, a network connection  weights can reflect the whole system input and output variables of the relationship, through the connection weights of the comparison of calculation, to explore the relationship between variables. Its main drawback is unstable, only when the Vmin value is low, the classification number is low, the calculation result is relatively stable, when the Vmin is approaching 1, system of calculation results ratio will be the traditional association rule approximation. In addition, compared with the traditional association rules, using the algorithm to calculate the support degree and confidence degree value will be lower, but the low value of the whole, that is to say in the associated sense there is no change, is only the value of low value. The experimental results on mining association rules, basically accord with objective and actual condition, the model algorithm has some innovation, but its stability and clustering precision still need to be improved.
