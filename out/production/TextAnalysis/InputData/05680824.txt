mming Performance using

Abstract One of the powerful data mining analysis is it can  generates different set of knowledge when similar problem is  presented to different data mining techniques. In this paper, a  programming dataset was mined using rough set in order to  investigate the significant factors that may influence students  programming performance based on information from previous  student performance. Then, the result was compared with other  researches which had previously explored the data using statistic,  clustering, and association rule. The dataset consists of 419  records with 70 attributes were pre-processed and then mined  using rough set. The result indicates rough set has identified  several new characteristics. The student who has been exposed to  programming prior to entering university and obtained average  score in Mathematics, English, and Malay Language subject  during secondary Malaysian School Certificate (SPM)  examination were among strong indicators that contributes to  good programming grades. Besides that, the personality factor;  the investigative and social type plus average cognitive person  were also found as important factors that influence  programming. This finding can be a guideline for the faculty to  plan teaching and learning program for new registered student.

I.  INTRODUCTION    One of the essential skills in computer related studies (IT)  is the ability to write computer program well.  Many  universities in the world consider programming as core  subjects which need student to pass the subject. The subject  teaches student to write an error-free program and trains them  to solve problem using the most optimal solution and produces  a quality system.

Many technologies that we enjoyed today are resulted of  the computer programming. A programmer with strong  programming skill has high responsibility to produce a  valuable and quality system. The good programmer is the one  who has ability to analyze and compare his native  programming languages and seek the advantages and  disadvantages of modern languages and language concepts [1].

In job market, there are many vacancies offered which  requires good programming skills as basis. In [2], more  programmers are required in 2010 which is 50% increases in  the number of currently required. This is an opportunity for  candidates with good programming  background to seek  computer related job such as programmer, system analyst, and  software engineer. However, graduates with low programming  skill might get less opportunity in software related job.

To meet the industry requirement, universities are keen to  produced graduates with good programming skill. Yet, high  failure rates were reported among students in higher institution  taking programming courses. [5] and [7] reported that the  failure rates in programming courses are about 30% to 40%  which is considered high. Although the graduates have been  trained with many programming experiences, some of them are  failed to apply the skills when they start working [6].

Learning to program is not an easy task to many students.

Most students believe that computer programming is difficult  and they require more time to master the core concept [3].

Similar to [4], programming is assumed as a tough subject for  new student which distracts their motivation to learn  programming.  In solving problem through programming, the  students are required to develop the abstract representation of  the problems and express them in a logical structure and  detailed realization in programming language which to them is  complicated [8]. Naturally, programming requires thinking and  analytical skill. [3] indicate the student perception on the  programming subject might contribute to their final grade on    the subject as well as high school calculus and science result,  gander, and comfort level. Additionally, the confident level  about their programming capabilities also helps them to  understand the subject easily [4].

Interest in the performance issue among programming  students has long been studied among researchers. Moreover,  there have been few studies in recent years on academic  success in computer programming which lead to assumption  that intelligent student can write a program well. In contrast,  there are students who are proficient at many other subjects  sometimes fail to succeed in programming [6].

Many studies have been conducted to identify the possible  factors that contribute to the successfulness of student grade in  Mining the Student Progra  ???  ___________________________________  978-1-4244-6793-8/10/$26.00 2010 IEEE    computer proficiency. As summarized in literature conducted  by [7], the high school mathematics grade, prior experience,  cognitive ability, learning style, personality types, self efficacy,  mental model, and gender are among the parameters for  evaluating computer skills.  The need of high-quality  programming skills is increased in demand; therefore the  learning ability of end user programming system is important.

Research on learning barrier in programming courses has  primarily focused on languages, overlooking potential barriers  in the environment and human factors such as personality and  aptitude. Therefore, the ability to predict an individuals  potential to learn programming concept is important for many  reasons [9]. [7] discovered students who have good  background in Mathematics and English, own investigative  type personality, have programming experience, and male are  more likely to succeed at programming subject. They  researched undergraduate students profile in order to identify  the relationship between academic background, personality,  and aptitude towards programming skill. In line with [7], [8]  justified that the mother language is a barrier to understand  programming batter.

In this study, we researched the programming  characteristics that influence the student grade using data  mining method. Data mining algorithm called rough set is used    to understand the relationship between characteristics. A  dataset of Malaysians undergraduate student from Faculty of  IT, UUM were mined using rough set.  Rough set is a  classification framework for discovering relationship in  imprecise data and can extract hidden pattern inside data.

Previously, this dataset has been analyzed using statistical  approach [7], decision tree [10], and association rule [11]. We  keen to compare the result with previous finding since different  techniques will generate different sets of relationships although  they are implemented to the same problem and produce  comparable result [12].

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines the  basic notion of Rough Set.  The model development of the  study is discussed in section 3. The experiment and result will  be presented in section 4 and final sections conclude this work.



II. ROUGH SET  In this section, the theory of rough set will be discussed.

The theory was founded by Zidslaw Pawlak in the early 1984s,  provides a mathematical approach to deal with uncertainty and  vagueness [13]. The main goal of the approach is to derive  rules from a set of data which is represented in a decision  system. It is donated as Ds= {U, Dc, Dd} where U is a finite set  of objects called universe, Dc is a set of condition attributes and  Dc is decision attribute. RS theory is based on the establishment  of equivalence classes in training data set and the formation is  almost indiscernible. RS deals with imprecise information in  information system (IS) using the concept of set approximation  which each vague object are described in lower and upper  approximation space. Consider an IS= {U, A} and X|U be a set  of objects and B|A be a selected of attributes.  B-lower  approximation is defined as Bx={X ? U:[x]B ? X} while B-  upper approximation is Bx={X ? U:[x]B ? X ? 0}. The set Bx  (or Bx) consists of objects which are surely belonging to X  which respect to the knowledge provide by B.  The set BNB(X)  = Bx-Bx is called B-boundary of X which consist of those  objects that not surely belong to X.

Rough set modeling assumes the existences of several  attribute in a data set are more important compares to others.

This is done by the reduct function which will determine only  important attribute to represent the whole problem.  Reduct  calculation determines the number rule, rule length, and  accuracy of the classifier. There are several algorithms to    perform reduct such as Johnson Reducer, Genetic Algorithm,  Dynamic Reduct, Holte1R, and SIP/DRIP.  Each method use  different method to control the generation of rule from dataset.

Generally, the rough set approach consists of several steps  leading towards the final goal of generating rule from  information system as given below:  ? Forming decision system by mapping information  from the data source  ? Completion of data  ? Descritization of data  ? Reducts computation of data  ? Obtain rule from the reduct  ? Classification of new unseen data

III. MODEL DEVELOPMENT  The experimental dataset use in this study is called  programming dataset.  It comprises information about  performance profile of Bachelor of Information Technology  students of Faculty of IT, Universiti Utara Malaysia in the year  2004-2005.

The dataset were merging of two data collections.  First,  primary data was collected from two instruments randomly  distributed to students who have taken introductory  programming which represents student personality type.

Second, further data of the respondents on their previous  academic background, demographic variable and grade in  Introductory Programming course was obtained from the  Academic Affairs Department of the university. Figure 1  depicts the model development of the study.

The performance information are the student result in  several programming subject particularly in introductory  programming, demographic information such as gender, prior  experience in programming, Malaysia Certificate of Education  (SPM) grades in Bahasa Melayu, Mathematic and English, a  seven question aptitude test, and personality test. There are 419  records elaborated with 70 mixture types of attributes and a  decision class. They represent about 31% of the population.

The students come from various program such as Bachelor in  Information Technology (BIT), Bachelor in Multimedia  (BMM), Bachelor in Decision Science (DEC) and Bachelor in  Education specializing in IT (EDU) which enroll for  introductory programming subject. Table I shows the    distribution of students in terms of gender and program. There  are 72% female students and 28% male students where about  75% students are from the BIT program.

The preliminary observation on the raw dataset, some attributes  were not related to study, certain values were missing and  duplicate. To mine the data, this study was divided into two  phases namely data preparation for mining and pattern  extraction.

A. Data Preparation for mining  During preprocessing task, all dataset were pre-processed  where all unknown numeric attributes were replaced with mean  value while max value for character attributes.  Then, the data  were discretized using boolean reasoning technique. The  programming dataset contains large number of attributes (70  attributes) and some of them were not related to the study  therefore only important attributes were selected for mining.

During selection, nine attribute which stored student  experience status in particular programming skill namely Java,  C++, C, Visual Basic, ASP, PHP, COBOL, Pascal, and  Prolong were reclassified into three new groups based on the  programming language characteristic.  The new groups were  Object, Structured, and Declarative.  Figure II shows the  reduction of nine attributes into Object, Structured, and  Declarative.

Figure 2.  Attribute reduction on student experience attributes in particular  programming language  Out of the 70 attributes, only 21 attributes were accepted  for the next stage as depicted in figure 3. The data was then  split into training (tn) and testing (tr) using n-fold cross-  validation technique. There were 5 different folds created based  on ratio of tn and tr; 90:10, 80:20, 70:30, 60:40, and 50:50.

Table II portrays the marks of each category. The categories  were considered as target during mining. The output of this  phase was a set of clean data.

List of accepted attributes for mining  The attributes in figure 3 represents the academics and  personality information of the student.  In academic group, it  stores the demographic information of the students (Program,  Gander), previous experience in programming before they  enter the university (PreExp) and also types of programming  they have learn (Structured, Object, and Declarative),  their  grade  in Bahasa Melayu (PBM), Mathematic (PM) and  English (PBI) subject during SPM and aptitude test result  (Aptitude).

The BGold, Bgreen, BBlue, and BOrange in personality  group hold the scores of color test while the Creal, CInv, Cart,  CSoc, CEn, and CCon represent the result of Hollands  ???  personality test.  Each score of the test represent the personality  of the student. Table III and IV elaborate both tests in detail.

Pattern Mining  In this phase, the clean dataset was mined using rough set  technique and ROSETTA was chosen as rough classifier tools.

In the application, it has 4 reduct computation algorithms-  Genetic Algorithm (GA), Johnson Reducer, Dynamic Reduct,  and Holte1R. The reduct method determines the selection of  important attributes that can represent the problem and later use  in generating classification rule. It effects the quality of rule or  valuable knowledge such as the number of rule, the length of  the generated rule, the accuracy of rule in classifying new  problems. Figure 4 depicts the basic reduct computation  method. From the preliminary reduct selection test, GA was  selected to mine the programming dataset since it had  generated better accuracy.  Rough set is a supervised learning    type. Thus, the last column of dataset that is the programming  skill- excellent, good, fair, and weak was considered as target.

To extract the characteristics that influence programming,  the experiment was divided in two processes. First, find the  best model which can be the best representation of the whole  data. The selection of the best model is based on the accuracy  of the model, the less number of rule generated, shorter rule,  and has high coverage. Second, evaluates the best model to  identify the characteristic that influence student programming  grade.  In this step, it focused at excel and weak programming  group.

IV. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULT  In this section, the experiment results of the mining are  represented. The goals and notations of the experiments are  formalized. The rough set model is given as RS. The training  and testing data are given as tr and ts while the chosen reduct  functions namely Genetic Algorithm is given as GA.  Since RS  is a rule based mining method, it generates knowledge in rule  form. Thus, the accuracy (acc), number of rule (nr), and  maximum length of rule (rl), maximum rule coverage (cv) are  recorded during experiment.  Those are the criteria to select the  best model. The acc of the classification shows how good the  obtained rule can classify new cases. Beside that, the nr  indicates the amount of knowledge needed to provide good  accuracy while the rl is maximum number of condition  attribute of the rule. cv refers to coverage of the mined  knowledge towards unseen data. Table V portrays the mining  results of programming data.

THE MINING RESULT  tn:ts GA  acc nr rl cv  90:10 83 32,629 4 0.175472  80:20 86 27,651 3 0.190909  70:30 90.5 23,109 3 0.208108  60:40 90 18.443 3 0.242  50:50 80 15,181 3 0.245833    From the table V, all models seem had generated a  comparable result in term of acc, rl, and cv. The 60:40 model  was chosen as the best model. This was due to the high acc,    good rule cv with less nr.  Although the acc of 70:30 model  was 0.5 higher than 60:40, the distinction was not significant as  well as had generated the greater nr. The model with lesser nr  but generates good acc is better than model that use more rule  to generate same result [12]. Table VI shows the rule  classification of the best model. The last column depicts the nr  of each programming skill and tr is the number of training  record to generate nr.

Figure 5 portrays the sample of rules of the both  groups.

The rule sample of the excellent and weak group  From the analysis on the generated rules, it shows that  student with programming experience before enter the  university has benefit to score the programming subject.

However, some rules indicate that the programming  background is not guarantee the student can score  programming well. The result was similar to [7, 10, 11].  In  line with many literatures, gender plays important role when  male is performed better than female. Furthermore, rough set  analysis found that student can score programming well with  only the average grade in Mathematic and English during SPM  (at least at grade C) and student with lower grade of both  subject might face difficulties in learning programming.

Additionally, another finding which is contradict with previous  study is the majority of excel group student has good grade in  Malay Language (at least B grade).  In term of bachelor  program that needs student to enroll programming subject, all  programs have similar chances to score the subject.

The relationship between personality factors towards  programming grades was also investigated.  Out of 3003 rules  of excellent group, there are 2184 rules which describe the  personality test result.  We further investigated all rules and  from the analysis, many students with investigative type and  average cognitive ability have ability to excel programming.

The findings were similar to [7, 11]. Interestingly, rough set  also identified that the social type student also can do  programming well. From the literature, a social type is an  emphatic, warm, kind, patient and helpful person as well as  prefers to teach and help others. Figure 6 summarizes the rule  analysis of personality test of the excellent group. The figure  shows that the highest score of the investigative type student  (C11-C20 and C21-C32) rule antecedent. It is followed by the  social type student. Based on Holland the theory, it is not  suggested the personality of student must fall into one the six  categories, but rather are composed of one each of the six    personality orientation. Generally, the Investigative, Artistic,  and Social are expected to associate together and less of the  characteristic associated with Realistic, Enterprising, or  conventional personality type [18].

V. CONCLUSION  In this paper, a dataset of undergraduate student from  Faculty of IT, UUM was mined using rough set technique.

Formerly, there were several researches had mined the data  using statistic, clustering, and association rule. This study was  aimed to identify another unique characteristic that influence  student programming grade using other data analysis method.

The study indicates that student prior experience in  programming before university can contributes to a good grade  but it is not guarantee that they can easily score the subject.

The study also reveals that average grades in Mathematic,  English, and Malay language during SPM also can influence  the final grade. Moreover, male student performance is looked  better than female.  In term of personality factor, the  investigative and social type plus average cognitive person are  found as important factors that influence programming.  This  finding can be a guideline for the faculty to plan teaching and  learning program for new registered student.
