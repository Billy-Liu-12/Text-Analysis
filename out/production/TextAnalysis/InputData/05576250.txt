A Summary of Genetic-Fuzzy Data Mining Techniques

AbstractIn this article, we have introduced some genetic-  fuzzy data mining techniques and their classification. The  concept of fuzzy sets is used to handle quantitative transactions  and the process of genetic calculation is executed to find  appropriate membership functions. The main contributions of  this paper are that we first divided the genetic-fuzzy mining  problems into four kinds according to the types of fuzzy  mining problems and the ways of processing items. Then, each  of the four kinds of problems has been described with some  approaches given.

I.  INTRODUCTION (HEADING 1)  In real applications, quantitative transaction data exists and  should also be considered. Since fuzzy set theory is being  used more and more frequently in intelligent systems  because of its simplicity and similarity to human reasoning,  lots of fuzzy data mining algorithms have thus been  proposed [5, 8].

Most of these fuzzy data mining algorithms assume the  membership functions are already known. In fuzzy mining    problems, the given membership functions may, however,  have a critical influence on the final mining results.

Developing effective and efficient approaches to derive both  the appropriate membership functions and fuzzy association  rules automatically are thus worth to be studied.

Genetic algorithms are widely used for finding  membership functions in different fuzzy applications. In this  article, we discuss the genetic-fuzzy data mining approaches  which can mine both appropriate membership functions and  fuzzy association rules [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9]. Thus, the main  contributions of the work are: 1) we divide genetic-fuzzy  mining problems into four categories; 2) different genetic-  fuzzy mining approaches of each of them are described with  some approaches given.



II. LEARNING MEMBERSHIP FUNCTIONS  There were several strategies proposed for learning  membership functions in classification or control problems  by genetic algorithms. Below are some of them:  1. Learning membership functions first, then rules;  2. Learning rules first, then membership functions;  3. Simultaneously learning rules and membership  functions;  4. Iteratively learning rules and membership  functions.

For fuzzy mining problems, many researches have also  been done by combining the genetic algorithm and the fuzzy  concepts to discover both suitable membership functions  and useful fuzzy association rules from quantitative values.

However, most of them adopt the first strategy. It is done in  this way because the number of association rules is often  large in mining problems and can not easily be coded in a  chromosome.



III. GENETIC-FUZZY DATA MINING TECHNIQUES  In this article, we introduce several genetic-fuzzy data  mining algorithms that can mine both appropriate  membership functions and fuzzy association rules. They can  be divided into four kinds according to the types of fuzzy  mining problems and the ways of processing items. The  types of fuzzy mining problems include single-minimum-  support fuzzy-mining and multiple-minimum-support fuzzy-  mining. The ways of processing items include processing all  the items together (integrated approach) and processing    them individually (divide-and-conquer approach). Each of  the four kinds of genetic-fuzzy data mining problems will be  introduced in the following sections.

A. The Integrated Genetic-Fuzzy Problem for Items  with a Single Minimum Support (IGFSMS)  Many approaches have been published for solving the  IGFSMS problem [1, 3, 6, 7, 9]. For example, Hong et al.

proposed a genetic-fuzzy data-mining algorithm for  extracting both association rules and membership functions  from quantitative transactions [3]. They proposed a GA-  based framework for searching membership functions  suitable for given mining problems and then use the final  best set of membership functions to mine fuzzy association  rules. It first transforms each set of membership functions  into a fixed-length string. The chromosome is then  evaluated by the number of large 1-itemsets and the  suitability of membership functions. The number of large 1-   978-0-7695-4161-7/10 $26.00  2010 IEEE  DOI 10.1109/GrC.2010.169   itemsets is obtained by using the set of membership  functions in the chromosome. The suitability measure is  used to reduce the occurrence of two bad types of  membership functions, which are too redundant and too  separate. Two factors, called the overlap factor and the  coverage factor, are used to avoid the bad shapes.

Based on Hongs approach, Alcala-Fdez et al. then also  proposed a genetic-fuzzy data mining approach by using 2-  tuples linguistic representation model. Besides, Kaya and  Alhaji also proposed several genetic-fuzzy data mining  approaches to derive membership functions and fuzzy  association rules [6, 7]. In [6], the proposed approach tries  to derive membership functions, which can get a maximum  profit within an interval of user-specified minimum support  values. It then uses the derived membership functions to  mine fuzzy association rules. Kaya and Alhaji also extended  the approach to mine fuzzy weighted association rules [7].

B. The Integrated Genetic-Fuzzy Problem for Items  with Multiple Minimum Supports (IGFMMS)  It can be seen that lots of researches focus on integrated  genetic-fuzzy approaches for items with a single minimum    support. However, different items may have different  criteria to judge their importance. In such cases, the above  approaches may not be suitable for this problem. Chen et al.

thus proposed another genetic-fuzzy data mining approach  [2], which was an extension of the approach proposed in [3],  to solve it. The approach combines the clustering, fuzzy and  genetic concepts to derive minimum support values and  membership functions for items. The final minimum support  values and membership functions are then used to mine  fuzzy association rules.

C. The Divide-and-Conquer Genetic-Fuzzy Problem  for Items with a Single Minimum Support (DGFSMS)  The advantages of the integrated genetic-fuzzy  approaches lie in that they are simple, easy to use, and with  few constraints in the fitness functions. In addition to the  number of large 1-itemsets, the other criteria can also be  used. However, if the number of items is large, the  integrated genetic-fuzzy approaches may need lots of time  to find a near-optimal solution because the length of a  chromosome is very long. Hong et al. thus used a GA-based  framework with the divide-and-conquer strategy to search  for membership functions suitable for the mining problem  [4].

In the phase of mining membership functions, it  maintains m populations of membership functions, with  each population for an item. Each chromosome in a  population represents a possible set of membership  functions for that item. The fitness of each set of  membership functions is evaluated by the fuzzy-supports of  the linguistic terms in large 1-itemsets and by the suitability  of the derived membership functions. The offspring sets of  membership functions undergo recursive evolution until a  good set of membership functions has been obtained. Next,  in the phase of mining fuzzy association rules, the sets of  membership function for all the items are gathered together  and used to mine the fuzzy association rules from the given  quantitative database.

D. The Divide-and-Conquer Genetic-Fuzzy Problem  for Items with Multiple Minimum Supports (DGFMMS)  The problem may be thought of as the combination of the  IGFMMS and the DGFSMS problems. The framework for  the DGFMMS problem can thus be easily designed from the    previous frameworks for IGFMMS and DGFSMS.



IV. FUTURE DIRECTIONS  Data mining is very important in the information era  especially when the data amounts are extremely large. The  research in this topic will continuously grow but on a  variety of forms. Some possible research directions in the  future about genetic-fuzzy data mining are listed as follows:  1) Analyzing effects of different shapes of membership  functions and different genetic operators; 2) Enhancing  performance of the fuzzy-rule mining phase; 3) Developing  visual tools for these genetic-fuzzy mining approaches; 4)  Extending these approaches to solve other kinds of  knowledge.
