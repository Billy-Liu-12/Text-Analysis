Abstract? This work investigated the effects of using a social media web application to assist learning and teaching in classrooms on learners? performance. We examined Facebook activities of 98 students, consisting of the groups of class of 4/1, 4/3 and 5/1 of Sa school located in Nan province, Thailand, during the first semester of 2011. We applied both statistics and data mining techniques for data analysis to determine the effects of Facebook usages for education on students' learning skills.

Statistics was used to evaluate the correlation between students' Facebook usage and grade point averages, and a data mining technique was used to learn association rules from data. This project has helped us learn the effects of using social media web applications (i.e., Facebook applications) for education on student-learning performance. We found that examining the ratio of number of Facebook posts and comments for educational purposes to the one for non-educational purposes could help us draw a conclusion that Facebook usage does have an impact on students' learning performances.  Specifically, we found that students who spent more time on education-related posting and commenting earned better grades than the ones who did the opposite. Furthermore, as we have to group data to change numerical data to nominal data, we found that data grouping play an important role on the number of rules and their associated confidence values. Too loose and too tight data grouping might be the reason the Association Rule algorithm derives few rules with high confidence values. We hope the results can help learners and teachers realize the advantages, disadvantages and effects of using social media web application for education.

I. INTRODUCTION Driven by the advancement of the Internet and mobile  computing, social media is a popular communication form that allows accesses to and from users throughout the world.

Facebook, by providing easy-to-use web services (such as posting news, sharing knowledge and entertaining media) and a very convenient way to reach other users, is considered one of the top social networking technologies. As of October 4th, 2012, it had registered 1 billion users [1]. In 2013, there are 18.2 million Facebook users in Thailand, 43% of which are students at ages between 6 and 24.

Due to Facebook?s popularity and its service varieties including seemingly instant access to its users, many attempt to utilize Facebook to serve their certain interest, especially in academic areas. Many instructors apply Facebook as a tool for communicating with their students. To the best of our knowledge, there is no research study on quantitative effects of using Facebook in classes. Although Facebook appears useful for connecting with students, it can result in an adverse effect. This is due to the same fact that Facebook provides various types of web applications including games and others for entertainments. These services could easily distract students from their studies. If students are unaware of this unfavorable side and are obsessed with using Facebook for only non-academic purposes, Facebook usage in class could worsen their studying performance instead.

In this paper, we studied the effects of using Facebook as a supplemental educational tool on students? learning performances. We investigated relationships between various Facebook activities and students? performances in classes.

Related work is discussed in Section II. We describe our research method, including collecting, preparing, and analyzing data, in Section III. We discuss our findings from a simple correlation method and an association rule method in Section IV. In Section V, we conclude our paper and suggest future work.



II. RELATED WORK Many previous works [2-6] analyzed the social network in  term of the network of relationships. Mathematics of graph theories were applied to analyzed how people interacted and formed connecting graphs.

Other previous works analyzed the effects of new technologies on student?s learning. Salaway et al. [7] made a survey on technologies students owned, how they used the technologies for both academic and non-academic work, and how technology affected their learning experiences in their perception. Li [8] focused on the role of Chinese online social networks in students? E-learning experience by exploring students? perception of social networks based on a  Quantitative Effects of using Facebook as a Learning Tool on Students? Performance  2013 10th International Joint Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering (JCSSE)     questionnaire analysis. Bunloet [9] analyzed Facebook usage by college students in Thailand.

There were many previous works discussing how teachers could utilize specific new technologies for educations. Block [10] suggested using Twitter in classrooms. Philllips et al. [11] suggested 7 ways educators could use Facebook for their students. Ractham and Firpo [12] suggested a way to enhance learning by using Facebook as a learning resource for learners to share and generate tacit knowledge within a small group environment. Saikaew et al. [13] stated that Facebook could be used as an educational tool for both formal and informal education. They studied the Facebook usage among undergraduate and graduate students in Khon Kaen University, Thailand, and a group of mothers sharing breast feeding information. As a tool for formal education, instructors usually create a Facebook group for learners to share class information, questions, and answers, while document management is usually done by other means, such as Moodle or Google Drive services. Similarly, as a tool for informal education, Facebook users may create a special learning group sharing a common interest, e.g., a group to share information related to breast feeding of Thai mothers.

The paper found that by using Facebook as a learning tool, learners were more enthusiastic about learning and more comfortable to ask questions and share knowledge. Moreover, instructors could quickly provide answers and feedbacks to learners. The work demonstrated that Facebook had a great potential to supplement other learning tools.

Although the works [11-13] mentioned above have studied the effects of using Facebook on learners? performance, their conclusions were based only on subjective perceptions of students via questionnaire, not a quantitative metric such as a Grade Point Average (GPA). In this paper, we extended their works to examine relationships between students? class performance (GPA) and using Facebook as an educational tool. This is to provide numerical evidences on how Facebook usage, as a learning tool, affects learners? performance in a formal education.



III. RESEARCH METHOD In order to find the effects of using Facebook on students?  learning performance, we divided our tasks into three steps: 1) We collected data from classes that actually adopted  Facebook as a supplementary tool.

2) We prepared data for analysis by cleaning data,  interpreting and converting messages into numerical values, and converting numerical values to nominal ones.

3) We analyzed data to find relationships using two methods: simple correlation and association rule learning.

We describe each step in details in the following subsections.

A. Data Collection We collected Facebook usage data from Facebook groups  used for classes in a high school in Nan province, Thailand,  during the first semester of 2011. Facebook groups were used for class discussions by instructors and students in grade 10 and 11. We collected data from 98 students in three classrooms: room 4/1, room 4/3 and room 5/1. Each data instance consists of a student?s GPA and several attributes related to Facebook activities described in Table I.

From the table, the important attributes are posts, comments, average duration in which a student replied to a post, and a student?s GPA. A post is an initiative message published on a Facebook group, while a comment is a reply to a post. We read and interpreted each post and comment and categorized it as related to class or not related to class. We collected 757 posts (490 class-related and 267 non-class- related) and 1984 comments (800 class-related and 1184 non- class-related) in total.

B. Data Preparation We prepared data for analysis as follows. From collected  data, we filtered out posts and comments from teachers and students who did not enroll in a class. Because we were interested in studying the relationships between a student?s GPA and the student?s Facebook activities, we only selected posts and comments from students whom we had access to their GPA information.

For data analysis, we aimed to use simple correlation and Association Rule learning techniques to learn of relationships in our data. Both techniques require data that are non-text.

Therefore, we needed to transform text data into quantitative data, i.e. numbers of activities and durations between activities. As mentioned earlier, we did this by first reading each post and comment, and then categorizing it as related to class or not related to class. Then we gathered counts of posts and comments in the corresponding categories for further analysis.

TABLE I: ATTRIBUTE DESCRIPTION FOR COLLECTED DATA FROM CLASSES  Attributes Descriptions  ID Student ID  Post (PT) Number of total posts made by a student  Post_Yes (PY) Number of posts related to classes made by a student  Post_No (PN) Number of posts NOT related to classes made by a student  Comment (CT) Number of total comments made by a student  Comment_Yes (CY) Number of comments related to classes made by a student  Comment_No (CN) Number of comments NOT related to classes made by a student  PC_Total (PCT) Number of total posts and comments  Avg_Comment (ACD) Average duration (in seconds) of comments made by a student after someone?s posts  GPA Student?s Grade Point Average (GPA)       For the simple correlation method, we removed the attributes ID, Post, and Comment. A student ID does not contribute to a student?s GPA. Post is a sum of Post_Yes and Post_No, while Comment is the sum of Comment_Yes and Comment_No; including Post and Comment would be redundant to the other attributes.

In order to apply an Association Rule algorithm, we needed to transform numerical values into nominal ones (ranges of numbers of posts and comments and ranges of GPAs) for each attribute. As there were several alternatives for dividing our numerical data into ranges (or groups), we experimented with three clustering methods: K-mean, T-score, and Normalized-T. We applied these methods to determine groups of values in each attribute and compared sets of association rules obtained from these different attribute groupings. We would prefer using a method producing ranges of values, which can reveal association rules with the highest confidence. The results of this experiment will be discussed in section IV.

We proposed a Clustering Index (CI) as a metric to measure the quality of our ranges produced from the above three clustering methods. A CI value indicates how well data are grouped together. It is defined as the ratio of the average distances among group centroids to the average distances between group members and their associated centroid. The higher a CI, the closer group members are and the further a group is away from each other. Intuitively, we would prefer groups with a higher CI because there is a clear cut between groups. However, we found in our preliminary results that grouping with low CIs sometimes provides association rules with higher confidence values. To see the effects of CI levels on confidence values of association rules, we also studied the differences in confidence values of association rules derived from data groups with different CI levels.

We defined four sets of CIs: lower, low, high, and higher CIs, for each attribute. For example, we may cluster PCT data into one, two, three, four, or five value ranges (or groups).

Clustering the data into 3 groups yields the highest CI, while clustering the data into only one group yields a lowest one.

Therefore, for attribute PCT, clustering data into three groups would belong to the higher CI set, and clustering data into one group would belong to the lower CI set (as shown in Table 2).

Then we calculated the Average Clustering Index (ACI) over all attributes of each CI set, yielding the ACIs of 2.82, 3.64, 5.52, and 6.03. For example, in a set with ACI equals to 2.82, there are two groups for the attribute PY_PN, three groups for CY_CN, one group for PC_Total (PCT) and three groups for Avg_Comment (ACD). The ACI of a nominal value set (lower, low, high, or higher) is the sum of CIs for each attribute divided by the number of attribute as in the equation below:  (1)  In this equation, D is the number of attributes in the data set and CI is a Clustering Index value of a given clustering of an attribute. For each data set with a corresponding CI level in Table 2, we learn association rules and compares overall rules? confidence values. We would prefer the ACI group that yields more rules with higher confidence. The experiment results are discussed in section IV.

C. Data Analysis As mentioned before, we analyze data using two methods:  simple correlation and association rule. In the simple correlation method, we calculated correlation coefficients between pairs of students? GPAs and each activity attribute.

For example, we found correlation coefficients between GPA and Post_Yes, GPA and Comment_No, and GPA and Avg_Comment. Simple correlation coefficient can be calculated by using the following equation:  . (2)  Denote r as a correlation coefficient, N as the number of instances, and X and Y are data points of two attributes. We were looking for correlation coefficient values higher than 0.6 or lower than -0.6 in order to indicate a strong relationship between GPA and other attributes.

In the association rule derivation, we ran the Apriori algorithm on our nominal data to obtain association rules with the minimum rule support of 10% and the minimum confidence of 60%. An example of an association rule obtained by the algorithm is below:  (A = 0-20) && (B = 0-30) => (C = 3.00-4.00) (3)  We interpret the above rule as follows. If A is between 0 and 20, and B is between 0 and 30, then C is between 3.00 and 4.00. A rule support is a proportion of instances in a data set, in which the A part is true and the B part is true. We can find a rule support by using the following equation:  Support(A,B)= #Instances in which A and B parts are both true #All Instances  (4)  TABLE II.  NUMBERS OF GROUPS OF ATTRIBUTE VALUES YIELDING THE GIVEN AVERAGE CLUSTERING INDEX (ACI)  Attributes Number of  value ranges (or groups)  Lower ACI (2.82)  Low ACI (3.64)  High ACI )5.52(  Higher ACI (6.03)  PY_PN 2 2 3 3  CY_CN 3 3 2 2  PCT 1 4 5 3  ACD 3 4 5 2       Confidence tells how firm the rule is supported by the data.

Higher confidence indicates that, given a set of rule support, there are a higher proportion of instances in the support set matching the rule. Therefore, we would prefer rules with high confidence (close to 1). Confidence of a rule is defined as follows:  Confidence(A,B=>C)= #Instances in which A, B, C parts are all true #Instances in which A and B parts are both true  (5)  After obtaining rules, we examined the rules with corresponding confidence values to see whether they are meaningful. The discussion about the derived rules is in the next section.



IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS We discuss results of our experiments and analysis in this  section. We begin with the results of the simple correlation.

Then we discuss results of the association rule experiments, which include the clustering experiments.

D. Simple Correlation We found that correlations between individual Facebook  activities and GPAs are quite weak. In Table III, we can see that the highest correlation value is 0.414, which is the correlation value between the number of Post_Yes (PY) and GPAs of student in Room 4/3 as well as the correlation value between the Average_Comment (ACD) and GPAs of student in Room 4/1. Most correlation values are around 0.2 or below.

Therefore, we conclude that an individual attribute does not correlate with GPA: an individual Facebook activity cannot be used to reflect student? learning performance.

As the simple correlation method considers only an effect from a single attribute, we then study further to see how more Facebook activity attributes jointly affect students? GPAs.

Next, we experimented with the Association Rule method, which can learn of relationships among several data attributes.

E. Association Rules 1) Data Clustering Before we derived association rules, we needed to convert  numerical data into nominal data as explained in section III.

We experimented with 3 grouping methods: K-Mean, T-score, and Normalized-T. We found that top rules from K-means achieved the confidence of 1 although rules from the two other grouping methods also achieved relatively high confidence.

Table IV illustrates these confidence values.

We can see that the top ten rules of K-means can all achieve the confidence value of 1. The top ten rules from the Normalized-T method can achieve the confidence values of 0.77 or more, while those from the T-score method can achieve little lesser confidence values of 0.67 or more. Since association rules generated from attribute values grouped by the K-means method can achieve the highest confidence values, and K-means is relatively simple to work with, we  used the nominal data set obtained by using the K-means clustering method for the remaining experiments.

To choose an appropriate CI, we examined confidence values of rules obtained by applying the Apriori algorithm on each associated ACI set (shown in Table II). Fig. 1 illustrates the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of these confidence values of different ACI sets. We plot the CDF on the y-axis and rule confidence on X-axis. If a graph slowly rises, there are a high proportion of rules with high confidence values. In contrast, if a graph quickly rises at low confidence values, there are a high proportion of rules with low confidence values.

Grouping set of high ACI yields a rule set with the highest portion of rules with high confidence, since its graph rises the slowest. Therefore, using the data set with the high ACIs is suitable for our purpose.

2) Associate Rules using Non-Ratio Attributes The top five rules are shown in Table V. For example, rule  1 says that if the number of Post is between 0 and 5, then a GPA will be between 2.20 and 2.89. Rule 2 says that if the number of Post_Yes is between 0 and 9, then a GPA will be between 2.20 and 2.89. We can see that, in this rule list, there is only one group of GPAs associating with Facebook activity attributes, GPA = 2.20-2.89. This could mislead us that students with higher or lower GPA ranges might not have Facebook activity patterns with high confidence. For these top rules, we investigated the data and observed that the levels of Facebook activities (the number of posts and comments) are low. So it could mean that students with GPAs in the range of 2.20-2.89 generally have low activities on Facebook.

Additionally, we noticed that there is only one attribute associated with each top rule. Rules with combined attributes start to appear after the eighth rule (not shown in the table).

We were wondering whether these rules were too simple. In any case, after examining our data set more closely, we found that students with higher GPAs tends to have roughly higher numbers of posts and comments related to classes than not related to classes. As a result, we conducted more experiment with a new set of attributes: ratios of posts and comments related to classes over those not related to classes, namely PY_PN and CY_CN.

3) Association Rules using Ratio Attributes Interestingly, after we replaced attributes (i.e., PY, PN,  CY, and CN) with the ratio attributes (i.e., PY_PN and CY_CN) and reran the Apriori algorithm, output rules were changed considerably. In Table VI, most rules are for students in the highest-grade group, GPA = 2.90-4.00. We can see that our prior observation was confirmed; the ratios of activities related to classes over those not related to classes do matter.

Note that if CY_CN is more than 1, it means that a student wrote more comments about classes than those not about classes. The higher the ratio, the more comments about classes relative to those not about classes are there. Rule 1 in Table VI  indicates that if CY_CN is high, students tend to get high GPAs (2.90-4.00). Rule 2-4 say that if a student has no post and/or comment that are not related to classes, the student?s GPA tends to be high (2.90-4.00) with a confidence of 0.64- 0.79. Rules 1-4 can then be interpreted as some students who got high GPAs tend to focus on using classes? Facebook groups for studying purposes since they had high ratio of class-related activities to non-class related ones.

In contrast, rule 5 in Table VI says that if CY_CN is low (0-1.67) while there were some posts and comments (0-34 posts or comments) on Facebook groups, a student tended to get low GPAs (2.2-2.89). This means that although a student participated in Facebook groups, the student might get low GPAs if they did not focus on class-related discussion in the groups.

According to results obtained from our experiments this section, we can conclude that  a) Each activity in classes? Facebook groups did not individually correlate with students? GPAs.

b) A student who had low Facebook activities related to classes tended to have a low GPA.

c) A student, who had a high ratio of activities related to classes over ones not related to classes, tended to achieve a high GPA. In contrast, a student who had a lower ratio, although with some activities in groups, tended to have a low GPA.

The data used in our experiments were obtained from students in three units in only one high school. At this point, we may not be able to generalize the results to students elsewhere just yet. We need to obtain more data from various schools/universities in various locations and examine the trends of relationships between Facebook activities and students? academic performance. We then could observe similarities and compare differences of students? behaviors in using Facebook for classes. Moreover, we could include other attributes that may relate to students? performance, such as time spent on Facebook, the use of other Facebook activities, such as Liking, Sharing, Messaging, Polling, and activities on Timelines, in order to have deeper and more complete understanding of how Facebook affects students? academic performance. However, this work serves as a beginning of our examination to learn about the quantitative effects of  TABLE V.

As discussed in this section, we actually saw some positive trends of using Facebook as a supplementary tool in formal education. Therefore, we would encourage instructors and students to adopt Facebook and other social networking tools, in a right way, to aid in a learning process appropriately.



V. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK After quantitatively studying how using Facebook as a  supplemental learning tool affects students? academic performance, we can see positive effects on students? learning.

Specifically, we examined the relationships between Facebook activities and GPAs of students in a high school in the northern part of Thailand, who joined Facebook groups for class discussions. We investigated Facebook activities, namely frequencies of posts and comments, durations that comments are made after each associated post, and ratios of class-related posts/comments to non-class-related ones. We found that an individual activity attribute is not linearly correlated with students? GPAs. However, when we applied an Apriori algorithm to learn association rules from our data, we found that students who had class-related activities more than non- class related activities tended to have high GPAs. In contrast, students who had lower ratios of class-related activities or low activities on Facebook groups tended to get lower GPAs.

Lastly, we found that data grouping play an important role on the number of rules with high confidence values.

In the future, we plan to explore this issue further by examining other Facebook activities such as Liking, Sharing, Messaging, Polling, Seen indicator and activities on Timelines. This will give us the better understanding of students? behaviors on Facebook. Moreover, we need to expand our data collection to various schools to be able to generalize the results.
