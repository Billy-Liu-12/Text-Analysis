I. INTRODUCTION  The water-fuel ratio control is the difficulty of supercritical unit. The response delay of boiler outlet steam temperature to the changing water-fuel ratio is considerable in supercritical unit. To improve the regulating speed and accuracy of water-fuel ratio, a variety of feedback signals adjusting water-fuel ratio are put forward, such as the heating section temperature, the intermediate point temperature, the flue gas temperature and the radiation temperature of the flame. They constitute more than ten kinds of typical water-fuel ratio control system. However, the existing water-fuel ratio control scheme can?t meet the requirements of large-scale varying load and variable pressure, and can?t give attention to celerity and veracity simultaneously in [1]. Therefore, it needs the further research and improvement.

On the other hand, power enterprises have accumulated a lot of historical data, and finding out the way to improve the regulation quality of the control system has deeply practical meaning and research value. Production data are characterized by plentiful, multidimensional and strong-coupling, and there are some correlations between these operation parameters.

LIANG Li-bo School of Energy and Power Engineering, North China University of Electric Power  Baoding 071003 China  This paper adopts data mining technology and applies multi-dimensional association rule arithmetic, in order to do qualitative analysis and evaluation of the water-fuel ratio related parameters, so that the reasonable operation data is determined to improve the contradiction between the celerity and veracity of the water-fuel ratio control system.



II. WATER-FUEL RATIO AND INTERMEDIATE POINT TEMPERATURE CONTROL PRINCIPLE  The condition that the water and vapor pressure is more than 22.129 MPa is called supercritical state in [2]. In the critical point, there is no the two-phase region of water and vapor, namely, water vaporize in a moment. Once-through boiler is a control object with multiple input and output. Because of no drum strong coupling between output and input variables is previously displayed; while units running in supercritical pressure scale  the changes of water-fuel ratio affect greatly the main steam temperature. So the steam temperature system, feed-water system and fuel system shouldn?t be controlled separately in [3].

A. Water-fuel Ratio Control Principle  Water-fuel ratio is the main adjusting signal of superheated steam temperature, because feed water quickly turns into vapor in the supercritical boiler. Boiler evaporation capacity is determined by feed-water flow and coal feed quantity.

Moreover, boiler heat storage energy is low, so steam pressure greatly fluctuates with external variable loads. There is no stable boundary between each heating surface in the process of heating. When feed-water flow or coal feed quantity are disturbed, they cause the steam temperature fluctuation. When feed-water flow is stable and coal feed quantity increases, heating section and evaporation section would be reduced, causing increase in pressure, temperature and power. When     coal feed quantity is stable and feed-water flow increases, heating section and evaporation section would be lengthened.

Then a part of steam is pushed out. At the beginning, pressure and power are increasing, but the reduction of superheated section lead to the decrease in steam temperature. Steam flow increases, but pressure and power still descend. The temperature monotonously declines, after time putting off. It is stable at a low point at last. Therefore, it is the basic method that keeping water-fuel ratio ensures stable superheated steam temperature. Water-fuel ratio is stood in steady working condition so as to ensure superheater outlet temperature to be set value; in varying condition, water-fuel ratio has to be changed according to certain regulation in order to make full use of the boiler heat storage in [4].

B. Relation between Water-fuel Ratio and Load  Water-fuel ratio is not constant, varying with the load. The relation is indicated as following in [5]:  ist ifw W  FQnet?  ist expresses superheated steam enthalpy(kJ/kg); ifw expresses feed-water enthalpy(kJ/kg); F is coal feed quantity(t/h); W expresses feed-water flow(t/h); Qnet expresses net calorific value of coal (kJ/kg);  expresses boiler efficiency.

Supposed the units? pressure is constant at certain moment, the superheated steam temperature and pressure are the fixed value. Namely, ist is a constant Qnet and  could also be regarded as constant. The boiler feed-water temperature increases along with the load increase, so ifw increases.

Therefore, F/W decreases, that is, water-fuel ratio increases according to the load increase. From the view of energy balance, feed-water temperature falls at low load, and the absorption heat needed by per unit working medium increases, so fuel quantity should be added according to energy balance.

Therefore water-fuel ratio decreases. In the same case, water-fuel ratio increases at high load.

On the other hand, when load changes, the feed-water flow and coal feed quantity are simultaneously adjusted according to water-fuel ratio, but they have different effects on the main steam temperature. In order to reduce the temperature fluctuation in the varying load process, the instruction unit of fuel amount and feed-water which is produced by load varying, have to set up dynamic correction links to ensure  dynamic coincidence of the feed-water flow and coal feed quantity.

C. The Intermediate Point Control Principl  The important point of supercritical units control lies in adjusting the water-fuel ratio. When water-fuel ratio changing, the response of superheated steam temperature puts off a lot.

So superheated steam temperature can?t be taken directly as the feedback signal of adjusting water-fuel ratio. But the intermediate point temperature responds the fluctuation of water-fuel ratio quickly, and corresponding curve is approximately one order inertial link. Therefore, it has been used widely in supercritical unit control.

According to supercritical boiler experienced data, the temperature changes only by which affect superheated steam temperature up to 10  at low load and about 5  at high load. If the intermediate point temperature could be controlled in a certain scale in boiler running process, it can be regarded as each phase transformation temperature stabilized in steam-water system, so that water-fuel ratio is kept at certain value. The intermediate point control principle is to keep the superheat degree of 15 ?20 . If intermediate point temperature is too high, the water wall outlet section will turn into superheater, which endangers the safe operation of water-wall and steam-water separator.

However, if intermediate point temperature is too low, heating surface of water-wall outlet section will work in wet steam zone. When boiler working in the subcritical pressure, steam-water separator run with water, and leads to influent superheater.

Thus it can be seen, the intermediate point temperature is one of important parameters of the supercritical units. As leading signal of the superheated temperature, the intermediate point temperature can not only reduce delay time of temperature regulation, but also control the working medium temperature in water wall in time, as well as protect water wall from film boiling or similar film boiling and wall tube overheating.



III. ASSOCIATION RULE ARITHMETIC  A. Classical Association Rule Arithmetic  Association rule is one of the earliest study objects of the data mining, and it is applied extensively in practice. Mining association rule is to find out potential relations in the    database, which focus on the relations between different data items. The classical algorithm association rule is Apriori algorithm. This algorithm applies the method of iterative searching in each layer, that is, K-1 order item set is used to explore K order item-set. Specifically speaking, the first cycle can gain the first-order frequent item set through scanning the database. The K (K>1) time cycle can gain K-order candidate item set Ck, after the K-1-order frequent item set Lk-1 is implemented Apriori_gen algorithm. Scanning the database again, support degree of Ck is gained, leading to get frequent item set Lk whose support number is the least support number in Ck. Repeat the above steps, and the circulating arithmetic is not stopped until empty frequent item set generated in [6].

B. The Multidimensional Association Rule Mining  The multidimensional association rule is divided into inter-dimension rule and mix-dimension rule. The inter-dimension rule doesn?t permit repetition field in the rule, its form is as follows:  ),(),(...),( 11 itemsXqvXpvXp kii k??  Mix-dimension rule permit repetition field on both sides of the equation, its form is as follows:  )2,()1,(),(...),( 11 itemsXqitemsXqvXpvXp kii k ???  the field type is divided into Boolean and numerical value.

Dealing with the field of the numerical value has three basic methods: (1) static discretization  (2) Boolean discretization (3) discretization based on distance Using the static discretization association rules excavation, the basic steps are as follows:  Numerical field discretization Application Apriori algorithm generating frequent item set  Generation multidimensional association rule

IV. APPLYING DATA MINING TOOL TO ANALYZE WATER-FUEL RATIO  Applying Data Mining Tool to Analyze Water-fuel Ratio Water-fuel ratio and the intermediate point temperature have an important role in once-through boiler control. Based on the real-time data of supercritical unit operation, the data mining tool?Clementine is adopted to analyze the potential relations  between the water-fuel ratio, the intermediate point temperature, the superheated steam temperature and the load.

A. Data Mining Tool--- Clementine  Clementine could help to discover and forecast the interesting and valuable relations existing between the data. Based on the graphical interface, Clementine offers a lot of models of artificial intelligence and statistic analysis, such as neural network, association analysis and clustering analysis. There are six steps in data mining process, as graph 1 shows in [7].

B. Analysis of Data by Association Rule  ? Data Source and Data Format  This paper adopted 1000MW unit?s operation data of a certain power plant in Jiangsu Province, the time segment is from 15:00 to 17:00 on March 3, 2008. A part of the real-time data is showed in table 1. Supposed of under constant pressure, we analyze and process the parameters.

Because of them being linear relationship, first stage pressure replaces main steam flow.

Data processing  Use ?excel node? to choose the analyzed file, at the same time, Clementine can read data. use ?derive node? to set water-fuel ratio the representation is RA07. The continuity data need be transformed discrete value in  association rule. Use ?binning node? to implement the discrete operation, the field of continuity data is divided into a number of same intervals, which are denoted by special symbols. Bin width is set, as table 2 shows. Table 3 shows discrete interval value. A part of the transformed data is showed in table 4.

In addition, it is necessary to set each field attribute, and type node can set data type, which is ?both? attribute in association rule.

?  Multidimensional association rule arithmetic  After the completion of data preprocessing, the ?Apriori node? in modeling zone carries out multidimensional association rule mining. The antecedent and consequent of association rule are chosen according to actual requirements. They denote that if antecedent1 and antecedent2??coexist, consequent will be obtained.

Multidimensional association rule arithmetic  The index parameters, minimum antecedent support and minimum rule confidence, are set by ?Apriori node?. The higher the index value is, the more precise association rules are. Superheated steam temperature and first stage pressure are took as antecedent, the rest are consequent. The minimum antecedent support is equal to 10%, and the minimum rule confidence is equal to 30%, then different association rule is displayed, as figure 2 shows. The meaning is that  If     IT06-BIN=2   RA07-BIN=6 Then   RP02-BIN=2  when intermediate temperature is in the range of [ 416.4881897  416.9881897], and water-fuel ratio is in the range of [8.50758385  8.55758385], first stage pressure is in the range of [17.10667305 17.20667305].

The minimum antecedent support and minimum rule confidence are separately equal to 30% and 100%. In the same way, there are certain relations between intermediate point temperature, water-fuel ratio and the main steam temperature. When intermediate point temperature and water-fuel ratio being in the above section, main steam temperature is in the range of [601.82029785 601.85029785], and feed-water flow is in the range of [601.82029785 601.85029785].

If intermediate point temperature is controlled in a certain range, water-fuel ratio will be a constant. Accordingly, superheated steam temperature is in a certain range. In addition, feed-water flow and fuel quantity can be changed in advance according to potential relation of superheated steam temperature and water-fuel ratio, so as to improve system control quality. For example, supposing the limit value of superheated steam temperature is 602 , we can regulate water-fuel ratio in 601.9  according to the corresponding relation of actual operation parameters.



V. CONCLUSIONS  According to a lot of historical data of production operation in power plant, it has great practicality that applying association rule to analyze the potential relation of the water-fuel ratio, steam temperature and flow. So superheated steam  temperature can be controlled precisely, based on the relation of feed-water and coal feed quantity. This has certain direction significance.
