Harbour Surveillance with Cameras Calibrated with AIS Data

Abstract?The inexpensive availability of surveillance cameras, easily connected in network configurations, suggests the deploy- ment of this additional sensor modality in port surveillance. Ves- sels appearing within cameras fields of view can be recognized and localized providing to fusion centers information that can be added to data coming from Radar, Lidar, AIS, etc. Camera systems, that are used as localizers however, must be properly calibrated in changing scenarios where often there is limited choice on the position on which they are deployed. Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, that includes position, course and vessel?s identity, freely available through inexpensive re- ceivers, for some of the vessels appearing within the field of view, provide the opportunity to achieve proper camera cali- bration to be used for the localization of vessels not equipped with AIS transponders. In this paper we assume a pinhole model for camera geometry and propose perspective matrices computation using AIS positional data. Images obtained from calibrated cameras are then matched and pixel association is utilized for other vessel?s localization. We report preliminary experimental results of calibration and localization using two cameras deployed on the Gulf of Naples coastline. The two cam- eras overlook a section of the harbour and record short video sequences that are synchronized offline with AIS positional information of easily-identified passenger ships. Other small vessels, not equipped with AIS transponders, are localized using camera matrices and pixel matching. Localization accuracy is experimentally evaluated as a function of target distance from the sensors.
