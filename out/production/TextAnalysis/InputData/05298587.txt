Primal Fusion Thought Networking  Demonstration

Abstract?Our thoughts are fleeting and immaterial, this mysterious stuff that?s locked away in our heads.

Painstakingly, we collect our thoughts and transform them into words and documents. This transformation from thought into action is time-consuming and expensive. Thinking is a decidedly ?offline? and manual process.

What would happen if you could instead make your thoughts tangible and concrete? What if you could collect your thoughts as readily as you can search online? What if your thoughts could self-organize around your tasks while you?re off doing other things? Thought networking is the idea that?s driving our efforts at Primal Fusion to explore these big questions.

In this demonstration Primal Fusion will show the thought networking platform and its applications.  This will be an interactive demonstration, where users are invited to try out their own thoughts and actions on the platform. A poster will provide a high-level technical description of the semantic platform components.



I. DEMONSTRATION SET-UP AND FUNCTIONALITY For this demonstration, we will provide a computer and  monitor for demonstrating our user experience, one or more laptops for allowing users to interact with our system independently, and one or more posters outlining some of the technical aspects of our system with respect to semantic engineering.

The subject of the demonstration will be the Primal Fusion thought networking platform and applications of that platform.  Technical aspects of the system will cover key semantic operations, primarily in the area of our approach to semantic synthesis.

The demonstration audience will have hands-on opportunities to use the Primal Fusion alpha products.  The audience is strongly encouraged to engage in dialogue about the technology and future directions for the technical approach.



II. TECHNICAL BACKGROUND  A. What is Thought Networking?

Thought networking is an activity.  It is the creation of  thought networks: concrete semantic representations of our thoughts, ideas, and interests. Encoded as machine-readable data, our thoughts are accessible to the power of computing.

As structured data, thought networks may be used as inputs to software ?agents? to automate much of the drudgery of our online experience.  Thought networks express our thoughts as concrete data structures, structures that can be used to re-organize web data around personal thoughts and interests.

Thought networks are semantic networks that represent thoughts as mini-webs of interconnected concepts; each network is essentially a personalized, idiosyncratic ontology.

Primal Fusion?s platform enables consumers to create, manage, and deploy thought networks without requiring knowledge of the underlying technical structure.

Static semantic representation is only one aspect of a thought network. We don?t merely form our thoughts, we connect them. The word ?thought? signifies a very elemental and dynamic cognitive unit. We manipulate and compound these primitive structures to form ideas, arguments, and perspectives. Primal Fusion uses a semantic synthesis technology to fuse primitive concepts into these higher-order constructs. Synthesis places thoughts in meaningful, task- oriented contexts.

Automation and tasking turn thoughts into action. With our thoughts collected and organized, we can put them to work: our thoughts may be collated with content and expressed as documents, they might traverse the Web to find related information, or they might interface with social networks to connect like-minded individuals. Organized within semantic networks, thoughts have the power to direct computer systems on our behalf.

B. Benefits of Thought Networking Thought networking is intended to provide two main  benefits. First, it will enhance our cognition. Our ability to store and recall information is extremely limited. Thought networks can help by expanding the number of thoughts at our disposal and organizing them effectively.

Second, thought networks will save time and effort.

Consider how much time you spend collecting and organizing your thoughts. Whether you?re writing a paper for school, planning a trip, or researching a medical condition, thoughts are the necessary precursor to action. If we can migrate some of that arduous process online, we can put computers to the task of simplifying your online experience.

Perhaps the best way to summarize these benefits is by way of an analogy to social networks. In social networks, we   DOI 10.1109/ICSC.2009.111     put our identity online. Our digital identities live and interact in social networks even when our attention is elsewhere.

Other people interact with us virtually while we?re off doing other things. And similarly, we can keep tabs on the people we care about, regardless of barriers of time or geography.

The benefits of thought networking are analogous. Once we digitize our thoughts and put them online, our thoughts may interact with the world even when we?re not attending to them. They become both an independent embodiment of our thinking as well as a powerful knowledge asset. Thought networks won?t displace thinking any more than social networks displace our socializing. But they will augment our ability to think and get stuff done.

While semantic technology provides for better search, better content management, and better data integration, it also provides an opportunity to make our thoughts tangible.



III. PRIMAL FUSION PLATFORM AND ONLINE APPLICATIONS  We intend to demonstrate one or more alpha applications that use the Primal Fusion semantic platform. The ICSC demonstration audience will be able to experiment with thought networking and with using their thought networks to engage in activities on the web. The audience will be encouraged to interact with the system and to engage in critical technical discussion about existing functionality and future directions.
