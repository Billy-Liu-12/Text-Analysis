A Scalable Method for Detecting Multiple Loci Associated with Traits using

Abstract    The recent advance in SNP genotyping has made a  significant contribution to reduction of the costs for  large-scale genotyping. The development also has  dramatically increased the size of the SNP genotype  data. The increase of the volume of the data, however,  has posed a huge obstacle to the conventional analysis  techniques that are typically vulnerable to the high-  dimensionality problem.

To address the issue, we propose a method that  exploits two well-tested models: the document-term  model and the transaction analysis model. The  proposed method consists of two phases. In the first  phase, we reduce the dimensions of the SNP genotype  data by extracting significant SNPs through  transformation of the data in lieu of the document-term  model. In the second phase, we discover the    association rules that signify the relations between the  SNPs and the traits, through the application of the  transactional analysis in the reduced-dimension  genotype data.

We validated the discovered rules through the  literature survey. Experiments were also carried out  using the HGDP panel data provided by the  Foundation Jean Dausset-CEPH, which prove the  validity of our new method for identifying appropriate  dimensional reduction and associations of multiple  SNPs and traits.

1. Introduction    In the early days, researchers mainly resorted to  statistical approaches (e.g. logistic regression) for their  attempts to figure out the correlation between genetic  information and phenotypic traits. Lately, however, the  number of SNPs available for genotyping has  exponentially increased because the cost of SNP  genotyping has dramatically reduced. The increase of  the volume of the data has rendered it difficult to apply  the traditional statistical techniques per se that are  tailored for full space search. As alternatives, some  researchers have proposed analysis techniques that are  based on algorithmic analysis such as genetic  algorithm or subspace clustering [1, 2]. Still, the  inherent high-dimensionality problem remains as a  challenge.

In order to address the problem, two well-known  models are put to use in this study: the document-term  model and the transaction analysis model. Using the  two models, a new method is proposed herein to  extract, from SNP-trait data, the multiple SNP loci that  play a critical role in each of the traits. The proposed  method first transforms the SNP genotype data into a  document-term model where a trait is represented as a  document and the corresponding SNPs are represented  as the terms in the document. Once transformed, a  variety of text analysis methods can be applied. In this  study, we used TF-IDF weighting as a dimensionality  reduction tool to filter out non-significant SNPs. We    then apply a transaction analysis model to the reduced-  dimension genotype data to discover the association  rules that signify the relations between the SNPs and  the traits. 1  The contribution of this work is as follows: First,  we demonstrated that by modeling SNP genotype data  in the form of a document-term model, a rich pool of  existing tools for text and transaction analysis could be  made applicable. Second, we showed that it is possible  to tackle SNP-trait association problems through the  use of TF-IDF weighting [3] and class association rule  mining [4]. Third, also proposed herein is a framework  for identifying how multiple SNPs and a trait get  associated, a framework that goes beyond the previous  works that are limited to the single SNP-trait  associations. Lastly, the proposed framework is    *Correspondence should be addressed to Jaewoo Kang at  kangj@korea.ac.kr   978-1-4244-8302-0/10/$26.00 2010 IEEE 318  directly applicable to all SNP genotype data regardless  of the types of traits and SNPs (i.e. whether a trait  represents a disease or sensitivity to a certain type of  medicine) because of the generalization that we  achieved through the abstraction with document-term  and transaction models.

The rest of this paper is organized, as follows:  Chapter 2 introduces previous works related to the  topic of this paper; Chapter 3 describes the background  information necessary to understand the proposed  approach; in Chapter 4 and 5, explored in depth are the  proposed method and the experiment results obtained  through it; and Chapter 6 concludes this paper.

2. Related work    Numerous attempts have been made to study the  relations between SNPs and phenotypic traits. As  mentioned above, the approaches are put in two  categories: statistical approach and algorithmic method.

The statistical approach has drawn a steady attention.

The multi-dimensionality reduction (MDR) is one of  the most outstanding examples of this category [5].

The MDR involves four phases. First, a set of n factors  are chosen. Here, the chosen factors can be SNP  genotype or environmental factors. Second, it  constructs a contingency table for case and control for  all possible SNP combinations. Third, using the  contingency table, it locates SNP combinations that  exhibit significant differences between the case and the  control. In other words, if the ratio of the case and the  control exceeds a predefined threshold, under a certain  combination, then this particular combination is  marked as high risk, otherwise as low risk. Finally,  the above-described processes are repeated through the  cross-validation process. Through this process, the n-  dimensional data representing the n factors is reduced  to 1-dimensional binary data. While the MDR is good  at reducing high-dimensional data, its complexity  increases rapidly as the number of factors in the  combination increases.

Zhang and Liu proposed a Bayesian inference  method titled Bayesian Epistasis Association  Mapping (BEAM) [6]. For the algorithm, they  adopted the Markov chain Monte Carlo method, which  is used to work out the probability of the SNP epistasis.

Each SNP belongs to one of the three groups: Group 0,  which has nothing to do with diseases, Group 1, which  independently operates on diseases, or Group 2, which  operate in conjunction with another SNP on diseases.

The BEAM computes the possibility of each SNPs  belonging to one of the three groups, and, thereby,  finds out the SNP epistasis that affects diseases. Here,  the odds are worked out, based on the Dirichlet  distribution. Although it employs a sophisticated  statistical model, in the test with real data, it sometimes  fails to identify some of the significant SNP epistasis.

In addition to the statistical methods, algorithmic  methods have also been proposed to find out SNP-trait  relations. Chanda et al. proposed a method based on  Shannons entropy to find out multiple loci related to  diseases [7]. In their paper, the entropy for each SNP  locus is computed, and is applied to the forward    selection algorithm to locate multiple loci related to  diseases.

Researchers have endeavored to come up with  algorithms for discovering SNPs related to outbreak of  diseases. For example, a decision-tree method was  proposed to examine interactions of haplotypes or to  interactions of SNPs [8, 9]. Yet another proposal was  made, which was to find out, through the rule-  inference algorithm, SNP combinations involved in  outbreak of diseases [10].

3. Preliminaries    In our approach, we reduced dimensions through  TF-IDF weighting [3], after modeling the SNP  genotype data through the document-term model. Then,  the class association rule mining [4] was put to use to  extract multiple SNP associations. We explain the two  concepts briefly here.

3.1. TF-IDF    TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document  Frequency) weighting is a broadly-used method for  text analysis. Under this method, weights are given to  terms in accordance with their appearing frequencies in  a document that they are in.

The idea of TF literally refers to the number of  appearances that a particular word makes in a  document. The more frequently a term shows up, the  more important the term is believed to be. For example,  if a word baseball shows up frequently in a certain  document, it is likely to believe that the document is  about a sport.

Despite a high frequency of a term, it is irrational to  assign a high weight to the word that is commonly  used in the corpus. In a scientific corpus, for instance,  the word science is not likely to carry a significant  meaning. In this context, a higher weight should be  given to a word that appears in documents in close  connection with a certain topic, while a lower one  should be assigned to those words that show up    without any contextual background. The IDF is used to  capture this. In other words, the number of documents  is multiplied by its inverse where a certain term  appears.

In short, the IDF helps understand the terms that  carry special significance in a certain type of  documents.

3.2. Class association rule mining    The association rule mining is used to identify the  associations of particular item sets from the large  transaction data. Under this method, transactions  involving diverse item sets are analyzed to find out the  sets that are associated with each other. For example,  the mining technique sorts out, in a giant retail shop,  which products are purchased jointly with which  products.

The end condition of the algorithm is determined  when the number of items reaches up to the one  designated by the user, or when the rules are made in  such volume as wanted by the user. Frequency of an  item is determined by the support of the  corresponding item set. The support for Item Set ? is  computed as frequency of I in transaction set T.

If this Support is lower than the user-specified  parameter, minsup, it is ruled out from the further  consideration.

Once the set of frequent k-item sets is determined, a  set of candidates for (k+1)-item sets is generated and  the same selection process is continued for this  candidate sets. When the end condition is ultimately  satisfied, association rules are created from the  discovered sets of frequent items.

Confidence serves as the criterion for extracting this  rule. If the obtained confidence for the corresponding  rule fails to be greater than the user-defined parameter,  minconf, the rule is aborted from the extraction process.

The class association rule mining is a special case of  the association rule mining, where the value of the  right side of the final rule is a class, for example, such    as traits in our context.

4. Method    We propose a new analytical framework to identify  the relations between multiple SNPs and traits. The  proposed method consists of two phases. In Phase 1,  dimensions of SNP genotype data are reduced by  means of the TF-IDF weighting method. Once reduced,  multiple SNP-trait associations are located from the  data in the second phase through class association rule  mining.

4.1. Dataset    We used the HGDP panel data in the study, which  are provided by the Foundation Jean Dausset-CEPH.

The data contain a pool of SNP genotypes of 1,043  individuals selected from 57 population groups. SNPs  of an individual amount to more than 660,000 in  number. To eliminate the impact of the gender factor,  SNPs on sex chromosomes were eliminated1.

The 57 population groups were broadly divided into  Africa, Asia, Europe, Middle East, America and  Oceania.

4.2. Phase 1: Dimensionality Reduction    The SNP genotype data are of high dimension in  nature, which makes it particularly challenging to  apply conventional analysis methods. In order to  alleviate the problem, we first reduce the dimension of  the data using TF-IDF weighting, after transforming  the data according to the document-term model, as  explained above. Under the model, each population  group is deemed a document, and each SNP genotype  as the term constituting the document. Then, the TF-  IDF weight of each SNP genotype is calculated as  follows:    ?? ? ?????  ???? ?  ????         (6)      where TFij is the normalized term frequency of SNP j  in population i, and IDFj is the log-ratio of the total  number of populations and the number of populations  that have SNP j.

In accordance with the calculated TF-IDF weights,  top-k high-scoring SNPs are selected from each  population. Only the SNPs appearing at least once in  the top-k lists are used for class association rule mining  in Phase 2.

4.3. Phase 2: Rule Mining    In the second phase, we analyze the reduced-  dimension SNP genotype data through the transaction  analysis model. If a SNP genotype retained by an  individual is considered as an item, it is possible to  deem each individual a single transaction. Within this  context, SNP genotype data are transformed into a set  of transactions. Further, each transaction is labeled  with a trait, which is in our context, a population group.

Once transformed, the conventional class association  rule mining becomes applicable. The class association  rule is expressed, as follows:    ?  ????????? ? ??????????        (7)    where ??????  ???!" ???#" $ " ???%&, representi-  ng a set of SNP genotypes and Populationj represents    1 http://www.cephb.fr/en/hgdp/   the jth population. This rule implies that the SNPSet is  likely to be associated with the jth population.

In conventional class association rule mining, the  support is defined over all classes. In our context,  however, it may penalize the small-sized populations,  as they are likely to be ruled out because of the  inevitable low frequency co-occurrence of the SNP sets  and the population. In order to address this problem,    we introduce a normalized support that is a support  normalized by the size of population. On the other  hand, for confidence, the conventional definition can  be used as is. The rule confidence and population  support are given as follows:    '???(??)?*??(?  +,-./+.01"+23456?278+,-./+.018      (8)  ??????????9????:?  +,-./+.01"+234561?278+,-3234561?278     (9)    Rule confidence represents how strong the  association between a SNP set and a population would  be. In other words, a rule is given a high confidence  when the SNP set appears frequently in the population  group, and not in the other population groups. On the  other hand, Population support refers to the frequency  of a SNP set existing in a population group. By  appropriately setting these two parameters, we are able  to obtain rules that highlight population specific SNP  associations.

5. Results & Discussion    To attest to the validity of the proposed method, we  conducted three tests. First, we conducted a clustering  analysis using the reduced-dimension SNP genotype  data in order to see the efficacy of the TF-IDF  weighting as a dimensionality reduction tool. Second,  we carried out rule mining to discover rules associating  SNP sets to populations. To prove the validity of the  rules obtained from the experiment, we performed  literature survey. Unfortunately, no studies have been  conducted on the SNPs that we extracted in the rules,  let alone the relations between them and the population.

Finally, we iterated the same test, this time to discover  rules associating SNP sets to the geographical regions  instead of populations. The validity of some of the  rules obtained in this experiment was proven through  previous studies on the SNPs that are related to the  Asian population [12].

For the dimensionality reduction test, each of the 57    population groups in the dataset was considered as a  single document, and a SNP IDgenotype pair with  minor allele was considered as a term. After weighting  the terms using TF-IDF, we extracted top-100 terms  from each population group. Using these terms, the  Jaccard similarity between each population group was  computed.

Figure 1 represents the dendrogram of the  populations that was constructed using the Jaccard  similarity as the similarity metric. The result shown in  Figure 1 suggests that the TF-IDF-based weighting  could be a viable alternative for the dimensionality  reduction for the SNP genotype data. The reason is that  population groups sharing the same branch are those  who live close to each other or those who live in the  same country. It is reasonable to assume that ethnic  groups living in similar geographical regions and  sharing similar cultures must come from the same  origin.

It was difficult, however, to interpret the results  concerning the Bantu group, since most of the  populations in Bantu group had only one or two  samples in the dataset. Still, it seems plausible to  Figure 1.  A dendrogram constructed with top-  100 SNP genotype data using Jaccard similarity   analogically infer that the emerging pattern of SNPs  minor allele of each individual using the Bantu  language is similar to each other. One intriguing matter  is that the Chinese minority group of Uygur population  shares branches with other Muslim population groups.

In other words, Uygur population shows a high  similarity with Muslim group. Indeed, they turned out  the decedents of Osman Turks2.

Rules extracted from the second experiment  where the associations between SNP genotypes and  populations are identified. The M and m refer to major  and minor allele at corresponding locus, respectively.

Previous studies on genetic structures of ethnic  groups reached a similar conclusion. Rosenberg et al.

conducted clustering analysis using SNP data,  clustering 52 peoples into 6 clusters [11]. Each cluster  belongs to one of the following: Africa,  Europe+Middle East+Central/South Asia, East Asia,  Oceania, America and Kalash population. Under this  scheme, Europe, Middle East and Asia populations  constitute one cluster. A similar result was observed  also in our study. For example, in the left part of the    dendrogram, Asian and European populations are  shown to share the same branch. In the middle part,  American populations share a branch. And in the right    2 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uyghur_people  part, Africa populations share one branch and  Central/South Asia populations share another.

Next, the class association rule mining was tested.

The resulting frequent SNP groups of subject  populations further revealed the frequent SNP sets  unique to some population groups. Some of the results  are shown in Table 1. Table 1 depicts top scoring rules  (up to three) per population. Some populations  returned less than three rules that exceed our quality  constraints. We used 0.3 for both Rule Confidence and  Population Support. In the end, 3,779 rules were drawn  out. Under each rule, M indicates the major allele of  the relevant SNP locus, while m refers to the minor  allele of the locus. Most of the rules are 3-SNP rules,  with the 5-SNP rule being the longest. Each rules  weight is computed through the following ; ? 9(?:?:    ; ? 9(?:?  #?<=>?@A?BCDCEF?G=@@EAHAIHCE<=>?@A?BCDCEFJG=@@EAHAIHCE    (11)    A SNP constituting a rule with high scores usually  shows a high frequency of its minor allele in the  corresponding population. For instance, with regard to  genotypes rs1553533 and rs1553554, one of the two  genotypes is found overwhelmingly more often than  the other in Surui population. Other than this  information, however, no studies have been conducted  on the relations between populations and the SNPs  extracted in the rules.

In order to work around this problem, we examined  the association between SNPs and traits in a coarser  level. In this experiment, we examined the association  between the SNPs and the geographical regions. In our  dataset, multiple populations are mapped to a  geographical region. The results are shown in Table 2.

We also used 0.3 for both Rule Confidence and  Population Support for this experiment. The rules    found in this experiment retain F-scores lower than  those in Table 1 This outcome seems to stem from the  increased heterogeneity of the individuals in the same  class (i.e., geographical region). Among the new rules,  KLMNOPQRSTTU ? V9?? suggests that rs256871 SNP has  some relation with Asian populations. Our literature  survey discovered an association between them such  that rs256871 SNP is part of SEPT8 gene, and, in turn,  the SEPT8 gene is known to be accountable for  tuberculosis among Asians [12].

Nonetheless, most of the rules found in this study  were difficult to interpret, because, out of more than  660,000 SNPs used in the study, very small numbers of  such SNPs had been subject to research for    3 The Allele Frequency Database, ALFRED, http://alfred.

6. Conclusion    We demonstrated that the well-refined methods  such as TF-IDF term weighting and class association  rule mining are applicable to the analysis of SNP  genotype data. The proposed method first reduces the  dimension of SNP data by selecting only the SNP  genotypes with highest TF-IDF scores. It then mines  the rules associating SNP sets and the traits using only  the selected SNP genotypes.

The proposed approach is independent of trait types,  and, thus, is readily applicable to all type of traits  without any modification. For example, in  consideration of vulnerability to various diseases and  responsiveness to diverse drugs, their relations with  multiple genotype sets are analyzable. In our future  work, we plan to explore various combinations of  dimensionality reduction techniques and prediction  models for the two phases of our analysis framework.

We also plan to evaluate some of the significant rules  further through wet-lab tests.
