Abstract?Delay tolerant networks (DTN) are characterized by intermittent connectivity, long delays and often con- strained bandwidth. We consider mobile networks where node mobility and covert operation cause frequent discon- nections. Nodes will see each other frequently but due to their movement, end-to-end paths do not remain stable long enough to complete a data transfer or even a simple data ex- change, much less allow current congestion control protocols to react to these highly dynamic environments. To address the challenge of congestion control in DTNs we have imple- mented a novel congestion control mechanism based on the use of tokens. Network nodes must possess a token in order to inject messages into the network. Tokens are initially uni- formly distributed but thereafter move randomly throughout the network. Using a discrete event simulator we show Token Based Congestion Control (TBCC) results in a reduction in the amount of dropped messages due to network congestion.

In cases where drops are not allowed we add a constraint to the forwarding algorithm and show that network transit times are reduced by as much as 40% and total transit times, de- fined as the time from message generation until delivery to the destination, are reduced by 20%. We also show 36% reduc- tion in the amount of intermediate network storage required.

These results are significant since they show a reduction in both space (network storage) and time.
