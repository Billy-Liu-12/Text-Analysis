Abstract?This paper presents an industry-unique approach and improved model-based engineering practices for software- reliant aircraft systems aligned with the Future Airborne Capability Environment (FACETM) open system technical reference architecture.

A lifecycle toolset is described which fuses systems and software modeling and simulation (M&S) capabilities, modular open system architectures (MOSA), and device and sensor integration techniques into a single package to enable rapid design, development, verification, certification, and deployment of interoperable, platform portable, embedded mission-critical safety-critical avionic systems.

TES? MBSE lifecycle toolset, AWESUMTM, supports system architecture and virtual integration (SAVI) of cyber-physical system (CPS) assets, and evaluation of these platform assets through simulated mission rehearsals in a network-centric collaborative virtual environment. The result is improved systems product.

The toolset has been demonstrated to several aviation-focused communities including the American Helicopter Society International (AHS), the Association of Old Crows (AOC), the FACE Consortium, and the US Army?s Aviation and Missile Research Development and Engineering Center (AMRDEC), with favorable response.

TES demonstrated a virtual simulation of realistically modeled and simulated multiple dissimilar aircraft platform systems conducting network centric operations (NCO). With the goal of improving flight-safety and enhancing the situational awareness (SA) of the battlespace, virtual missions were executed showing the interoperations of cyber-physical system (CPS) assets and capabilities from reusable FACE-aligned applications. The simulated battlespace was composed of device-configured simulated flight models of both manned and unmanned rotorcraft platforms operating within a virtual environment of real-world terrain data. The environment included simulated threats and obstacles used to stimulate platform devices that report detections and produce alerts for own-ship flight mishap avoidance. These detections were then packaged into communications messages (VMF) and shared off-platform via NCO to the common operating picture (COP) to enhance the SA operations of the battlespace flight group.

After a decade of development and use supporting US Army military common software programs for the PM-AME and AMRDEC, TES is now making its industry-unique approach and model-based airworthy systems/software lifecycle product line available to industry. The MBSE lifecycle toolset product suite, referred to as AWESUMTM for AirWorthy Engineering  Systems Unified Modeling, is a comprehensive model-based environment aligned to DO-178C, DO-331, AC 20-148, AR 70- 62, and FACETM.

The AWESUMTM tool suite is currently supporting the US Army?s Joint Common Architecture project, a model-based avionics architecture for the Joint Multi-Role family of future vertical lift platforms, and two other FACE-aligned US Army Aviation programs within the military communications and aircraft survivability domains.

This is TES-SAVi?s first publication and presentation to the IEEE. While we have applied our capabilities to the Military Aviation domain, these capabilities can be effectively applied to Aerospace and other domains.
