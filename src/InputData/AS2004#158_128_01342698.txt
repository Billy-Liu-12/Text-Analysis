Mining Dynamic Interdimension Association Rules for Local-scale  Weather

Abstract Mining dynamic interdimension association rules for local-scale weather prediction is to discover abnor- mal weather phenomena changing so that the professional weather forecaster can use these rules to predict some se- vere weather situations, such as hail storm, thunder storm and so on. A weather analysis is composed of individ- ual analyses of the several meteorological variables.

When some of meteorological variables have some spe- cial change tendency, some kind of severe weather will happen in most cases. In this paper, we propose a new al- gorithm, DIAL to discover potential relations between the special change tendency and the severe weather. The algorithm consists three parts: (1) Change the origi- nal static database recording the weather condition data into a new database with the changing tendency of ev- ery measurements of the weather; (2) Discover multi- dimensional association rules from the new generated database; (3) Use the prede?ned predicts to transfer the in- terval rules into the dynamic interdimension association rules.

1. Introduction Data mining was ?rst introduced within the business world. However much of the work on Data Mining is that most, if not all, of this work is just as applicable to the scienti?c environment, such as astronomy, biology, bio- nomics, geography, genetics, medicine, meteorology, and so on [7, 5, 4, 8, 10, 16, 11].We present in this paper our efforts of introducing temporal association rules mining into one of the most important applications of meteorology, weather prediction.

Severe weather is any type of violent or extreme weather event that represents a hazard to public safety and wel- fare [9]. Modern data assimilation requires two sets of in-    formation to generate an estimated analysis of the current state of the atmosphere: (1) a set of recently collected ob- servations and (2) a prior forecast estimate of the state of the atmosphere valid at the time of the observations, known as the background. The new observations are used to adjust, or update the background in a manner designed to produce a minimum-error analysis. The problem of the discovery of temporal association rules comes from the need to discover patterns in transaction data in a supermarket [2]. We ?nd that some special meteorological variables? changing has tight relation with some severe weather situation that will happen very soon. Since the data of everyday weather con- dition are so huge that many relations can not be found eas- ily only by directly observation. Using the discovery of as- sociation rules, we can scan a large amount of the weather record to ?nd more relation pairs hidden behind.

The organization of the rest paper is as follows. In Sec- tion 2, we present the related works and our contribution.

The problem de?nition is formally given in Section 3. In Section 4, we propose an algorithm for mining temporal as- sociation rules on the pre-processed data. We present our experience with the algorithm on a real-life dataset in Sec- tion 5. Finally, we discuss the related future work and con- clude with summary.

2. Related Works and Our Contribution 2.1. Related Works Many other researchers have tried to using some other data mining technologies in areas related to weather predic- tion or global climate changing. The emphasis in [11] is on using K-means clustering to divide the land and ocean ar- eas of the earth into disjoint regions in an automatic so that Proceedings of the 28th Annual International Computer Software and Applications Conference (COMPSAC?04) enables the direct or indirect discovery of interesting pat- terns.

In [13] the probabilityof weather prediction is discussed.

The predictability of weather and climate forecasts is deter- mined by the projection of uncertainties in both initial con- ditions and model formulation.

From [6], we can get that water in its various phases plays a critical role in the climate system. Evaporation of water from the surface keeps the average surface tempera- ture far cooler than it would otherwise be, but water vapor is also the most important greenhouse gas in the atmosphere and condensed water in the form of clouds is also an im- portant absorber of longwave radiation. On the other hand, much of the earth?s albedo is owing to clouds.

The ?rst explicit analysis of the weather prediction prob- lem from a scienti?c viewpointwas undertaken at the begin-    ning of the last century [12], when the Norwegian scientist VilhelmBjerknes set down a two-step plan for rational fore- casting: ?The necessary and suf?cient conditions for the rational solution of forecasting problems are the following: 1. A suf?ciently accurate knowledge of the state of the at- mosphere at the initial time.

2. A suf?ciently accurate knowledge of the laws accord- ing to which one state of the atmosphere develops from an- other.? 2.2. Our Contribution In this paper, we propose a new framework to discover dynamic interdimension association rules for local-scale weather prediction. This framework consists of a formal model de?nition and a three-phase algorithm for discov- ery. We modify the classical association rules model with adding some constrains so that it becomes feasible for min- ing interdimension relations from the weather record data.

We also propose a new algorithm, DIAL, incorporating the algorithm for quantitative association rules mining and the process of database transformation.Using this algorithmwe can get the potential rules for local-scale weather predic- tion.

3. Formal Model In this section, we propose the formal model de?nition for dynamic intermension association rules discovery. In ad- dition, some speci?cations on the parameters selection are also clari?ed in this section.

3.1. Problem Formulation This problem is generated from the requirement of local- scale weather prediction. It captures the essential properties of the measurements of weather condition so that the later proposed algorithm which uses this formulation will pro- vide practically useful rules. The problem is formally de- ?ned as follows: Given: A set of multi-value attributes,     ,   , . . . , .

A database of the weather condition record D.

The minimum support factor minsup.

The minimum con?dence factor minconf.

Find: Dynamic interdimension association rules with the support factor  and con?dence fac- tor  .

Objective: Maximize the support factor and the con?-    dence factor according to the correspondent rule.

Constraints: 1. Each attribute corresponds to a meteorological variable, such as temperature, pressure, dew point, wind, clouds, visibility, condition and so on.

2. The last attribute   as the attribute correspond- ing to the meteorological variable condition.

3.  is a set of predictions according to the at- tributes in set  except   .

4. Every attribute appears at most once in the pre- diction set  .

5. The support factor should be greater than or equal to the given minsup.

6. The con?dence factor should be greater than or equal to the given minconf.

The following rule is an example of dynamic association rule: decrease(Temperature,5) ? decrease(Pressure,0.6) shower[s=3%, c=30%] 3.2. Parameter Speci?cation In above formulation, the problem of rule mining has the following issues which are needed to be clari?ed: (1). The limited predicates used to express the associa- tion rules are: increase, decrease, equal and direction-range.

Two-digit numbers are used to report wind direction to the nearest tens of degrees. Thus, 02 represents 20 ? , 18 is 180 ?

and 32 is 320 ? . North is always taken as 360 ? and is re- ported as 36.

(2). Thirty-six-hour forecasts today are now generally ?perfect?, at least in the general features, and the 72-hour forecasts of today are as accurate as 36-hour forecasts were just ten to twenty years ago [15]. To make our discovery more useful, the moderate range of the record used to dis- cover should be within 36-hour.

Proceedings of the 28th Annual International Computer Software and Applications Conference (COMPSAC?04) Different sever weather situationwill need different time period for forecasting. The sever situations with high speed generation process, such as thunderstorms, need shorter ob- servation period. Others may need a little longer period, once per day or twice per day.

(3). Some sever weather situations are popular in some speci?c seasons. For example, hurricanes often happen in the South of America in summer and blizzards concen- trate in the Midwest of America in winter and spring and scarcely happen in other seasons. We will use different con-    straint values for those situations depending more on sea- sons within the process of discovery.

4. Dynamic Interdimension Association rules for Local-scale weather prediction (DIAL) Algorithm In general, the DIAL algorithm consists of the following three phases.

1. Phase I: Database Transformation 2. Phase II: Generating the Quantitative Associa- tion Rules 3. Phase III: Generating the Dynamic Interdimension Association Rules 4.1. Phase I: Database Transformation The original database  storing the observation data needs to be transformed into a new database   storing the change of each attributes according to the situation. The database   has the same attributes as the database  . The method for generating new tuples is described as follows: 1. from    =2 for all tuples in the database 2. for every attributes   in this tuple     do 3. if Name(   ) = Condition 4.

= 5. else if   = Null 6.

= Null 7. else if     Null 8.

= compare(    ,       )    9. else 10.

= Null 11. add  into    12. endfor 13. add    into 14. endfor 4.2. Phase II: Generating the Quantitative Associ- ation Rules After generating the new database   describing the change of each attribute, we try to discovery the frequent itemsets. Much of the data in   are continuous but not discrete. Therefore, we cannot use ordinary method [3], such as Apriori algorithm, to generate frequent itemsets. We should use the algorithm mentioned in [14] to generate the rules. The following issues should be clari?ed before us- ing the algorithm: (1) The partitions for the attributes. Different measure- ments of the weather need different partition rules. Follow- ing is the detail of the rule: Temperature: The partition of temperature difference would be  (-  , -20), [-20, -15), [-15, -10), [-10, -5), [-5, 0), 0, (0, 5], (5, 10], (10, 15], (15, +  )  .

Humidity: The partition of humidity difference is the same as that of temperature.

Dew Point: Dew point is related to temperature. There- fore they are using the same partition.

Wind Speed: The partition of wind-speed difference is as follows:  (-  , -40), [-40, -20), [-20, -10), [-10, -5), [-5, 0), 0, (0, 5], (5, 10], (10, 20], (20, 40], (40, +  )  .

Wind Direction: The partition of wind-direction is as follows:  (0,6], (6, 12], (12, 18], (18, 24], (24, 30], (30, 36]  .

Pressure: Its partition is:  (-  , -0.8), [-0.8, -0.6), [-0.6, -0.4), [-0.4, -0.2), [-0.2, 0), 0, (0, 0.2], (0.2, 0.4], (0.4, 0.6], (0.6, 0.8], (0.8, +  )  .

Visibility: Its partition is:  (-  , -4), [-4, -3), [-3, -2), [- 2, -1), [-1, 0), 0, (0, 1], (1, 2], (2, 3], (3, 4], (4, +  )  .

Precipitation:Use the same partition as that of pressure.

(2) The minsup for some seasonal sever weather situa-    tion should be set in proportion to the appearance probabil- ity within a whole year.

4.3. Phase III: Generating the Dynamic Interdi- mension Association Rules After Phase II, we discover some quantitative associa- tion rules. At this time we introduce our prede?ned predi- cates into these rules to generate the dynamic interdimen- sion association rules. Since many of the items consisting of the rules are ranges, we can either still use this range or the mean value of the range to express those items. The rules generated include the associations of all of the weather condition, not only those severe conditions. The ?nal phase of this algorithm needs more interaction between the algo- rithm and the end-user so that the discovery may get a much better result.

5. Experience with a real-life dataset We assessed the correctness and effectiveness of our al- gorithm by experimenting with a real-life dataset. The data were weather record data of Dallas City from April 2002 to June 2002 [1]. The data had ten attributes which include Proceedings of the 28th Annual International Computer Software and Applications Conference (COMPSAC?04) eight quantitative attributes and two categorical attributes.

There were 1092 records in the dataset.

5.1. Experiment Design The datasets getting from Weather Underground and NCDC are raw data.The most distinct weather changes which happen in all spring and the early summer accord- ing to Dallas City. Therefore choosing this part of data can clearly re?ect the relation between the meteorological vari- ables and the weather conditions. The ?rst step of our ex- periment is to rearrange the dataset. The ?rst phase of our algorithm is to build a new database re?ecting the changing tendency of the meteorological variables. After this phase, determing the number of partitions for each quantitative at- tribute and how to partition should be accomplished. In the second phase of our algorithm, we use the algorithm in [14] to generate the frequent itemsets. The algorithm used to generate association rules is different to the traditional algo- rithm in [3]. In our algorithm we only generate rule whose right-hand-side only contains the DYSW attribute. The ?nal phase will use our prede?ned predicates to generate the dy- namic interdimension association rules.

5.2. Result Evaluation Evaluating the usefulness of the results from running our algorithm need some special review. However, some rules we get are pretty straightforward. The following rule is gen- erated when we set minsup to 8% and minconf to 20%: direction range (RDIR, 12..18) ? increase(DPTP, 0..5)    Thunder-Storm [ s = 8%, c = 20 %] Dallas City is located near Gulf of Mexico which is lo- cated in the southeast of the city. When the warm air?ow moves toward northwest, it is moisture-conditioned. After its landing, it will meet some cold air?ow existing in the land. If the warm air?ow is stronger than the cold one, it can still go north and push the cold one back. Along this way, there will be a plenty of precipitation. Now looks back to the geographical position of Dallas City. It?s just on the way of the warm air?ow and the distance between the city and the coast is also not very far. That is why the warm air- ?ow can bring much precipitation to this city from south- east. When warm air?ow comes, the relative humility will increase which will make the dew point increase.

6. Conclusions In this paper, we introduce the problem of mining dy- namic interdimension association rules for local-scale se- vere weather prediction. We ?rst transform the original weather record database into a new database expressing the change tendencies of the measurements of the weather.

Then we use the algorithm for mining quantitative associa- tion rules to generate the result rules in quantitative format.

Finally, we introduce some predicates to generate the ?nal rules.

In this paper, we focus on the time-related measurements of weather. In the future, we will incorporate the space- related measurements for weather prediction. In addition, we will improve our model so that it will ?t for a regional, even global weather prediction.
