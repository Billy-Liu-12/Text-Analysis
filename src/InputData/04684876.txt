Identifying interface elements implied in protein-protein interactions using statistical tests and Frequent Item Sets

Abstract  Understanding what are the characteristics of protein- protein interfaces is at the core of numerous applications.

This paper introduces a method in which the proteins are described with surfacic geometrical elements. Starting from a database of known interfaces, the method produces the el- ements and combinations thereof that are characteristic of the interfaces. This is done thanks to a frequent item set technique and the use of statistical tests to ensure a marked difference with a null hypothesis. This approach allows one to easily interpret the results, as compared to techniques that operate as ?black-boxes?. Furthermore, it is natu- rally adapted to discover disjunctive concepts, i.e. differ- ent underlying processes. The results obtained on a set of 459 protein-protein interfaces from the PDB database con- firm that the findings are consistent with current knowledge about protein-protein interfaces.

1 Introduction  Understanding how proteins function, and, particularly protein-protein interactions, is of paramount importance for biology and medicine and is a coveted prize for many re- search efforts [13]. Being able to predict interactions would permit searching a database of proteins and retrieve all pro- teins that can interact with a given molecular structure, e.g.

another protein [4, 11]. This entails two sub-questions: how to predict that two proteins may interact (i.e. bind) and, if so, what are the most likely docking sites (i.e. the ones asso- ciated with the minimal energy of the compound structure)?

Several directions have been explored to solve these problems. The first one is to start from fundamental pre- misses, meaning here the sequences of amino-acids that make up the proteins, and knowledge of their physico- chemical properties and how these translate in terms of  energy. In principle, a sufficiently detailed model should allow one to compute with enough accuracy the energy of each configuration of interest and therefore predict the likely protein-protein complexes and their probable bind- ing sites. This line of attack is however precluded, at least at the present time, by the sheer magnitude of the size of the search space and by the complexity of the energy com- putations. Another route is to try to learn by automatic means to discriminate native-like protein-protein complexes from decoys. Many questions then arise. One concerns the choice of the parameters used to represent proteins and protein-protein complexes that are input to the learning al- gorithm. Another question is the determination of nega- tive instances of complexes, or decoys. As, usually, the databases only contain positive instances of protein-protein complexes, negative instances have to be generated. Most often, this consists in generating other, random, conforma- tions and orientations of the proteins, assuming that these correspond to bad or impossible pairings. However, the quality of these negative instances may be disputed and can profoundly affect the performance of the learning methods.

This is why another approach is proposed in this re- search work. In our work, interfaces of known protein- protein complexes are described by collections of small sub- graphs taken in a dictionary of elementary patterns, much as transactions in a database of purchases in a supermarket are made of collections of items in a given set of products. This analogy suggests to use techniques of data mining in order to detect characteristic regularities in known protein-protein interfaces. This approach presents three advantages over the use of standard supervised machine learning techniques.

First, there is no need for building questionable negative in- stances of protein-protein complexes. Second, the results can be analyzed and may lead to a better understanding of the formation of complexes. And, third, it is easy to convert the regularities discovered into a prediction tool that scores the potential pairings of proteins.

DOI 10.1109/BIBM.2008.68     The paper starts with the representation used for the de- scription of the protein structure. Section 3 describes in a generic way the new proposed method to analyze whether the interfaces of protein-protein complexes have special properties, and, if yes, which ones. The results obtained using the Protein Data Bank [3] and data extracted from the Dockground database [9] are described in section 4. Fi- nally, section 5 discusses the results obtained in light of the overall protein docking problem and opens directions for extensions of this work.

2 Representing the geometry of proteins  In order to understand how two proteins can form a com- plex, we need both to know what defines their surfaces, and more precisisely their interface, and which atoms or amino acids participate in this interface [2, 12]. In this work, we rely on a weigthed alpha complex model which, under some constraints, can be considered as a dual of the Vorono?? model [8].

Let us consider the set of balls B = Bi(pi, wi), where pi represents the center of ball i and wi the square of its radius.

Then, the weighted alpha shape is the domain of these balls and the weigthed alpha complex is the corresponding skele- ton, with alpha controlling the desired level of precision [7].

It contains geometrical patterns (strictly speaking sim- plexes, later to be called items) that are: the points of B, the edges defined by the centers of pairs of balls that have a non empty intersection, the triangle and the tetrahedron defined analogously. The figure 1 shows an example of this repre- sentation in two dimensions, with 14 spheres or balls, with a null alpha (a) and with a non null alpha (b). Alpha controls the level of detail by varying the radius of balls (  ? wi + ?)  and, hence, the nature of the geometrical representation. For more details, see [10].

Equating amino acids with balls (with a radius depend- ing on their physico-chemical properties), the interface of a protein-protein complex is defined as the set of edges, tri- angles and tetrahedra of which at least one point belong to each of the paired proteins.

Additional information about the nature of the amino acids involved is needed. However, because there are twenty different amino acids, the number of possible el- ementary geometrical items (edges, triangles and tetrahe- dra) is too large (? 10600) compared to the number of available examples (here 459 selected complexes). Hence, we have decided to group the amino acids with respect to their physico-chemical properties [6]. Considering five groups defined according to broad biochemical properties: hydrophobic, polar, positively charged, negatively charged and small (resp. noted H , P , +, ? and S), thus brings down the repertoire to 120 distinct descriptive items.

Using this representation, one typical interface between  Figure 1. (a) the alpha shape in 2D with al- pha=0, and (b) with alpha 6= 0.

proteins involves between 15 to 50 items, some of them pos- sibly repeated.

3 Analysis by frequent item sets and statisti- cal hypothesis testing  Thanks to the method described in the previous sec- tion, 459 protein-protein complexes from the Protein Data Bank [3] have been represented as well as their interfaces1.

Each one of these interfaces is characterized by a collection of descriptors taken out from 120 elementary geometrical items. For instance, a given interface could be described as: ?(S1 ! +2), (S1H1?1 ! +2)?, where the subscripts are used to indicate which protein (either protein 1 or pro- tein 2) is providing the amino-acid. In this example, the in- terface involves two elementary geometrical items: an edge made of a small amino-acid S coming from protein 1 and a positively charged amino-acid + coming from protein 2, to- gether with a tetrahedron of which the triplet (SH?) is pro- vided by protein 1 and the amino-acid + comes from pro- tein 2. On average, the interfaces are composed of approx- imately 22 geometrical items, which amounts to approxi- mately 10,000 items for the whole set of 459 interfaces.

The central question is: do the interfaces of the known protein-protein complexes present special regularities?

Given the relatively small numbers of known interface components (? 10, 000) as compared to the number of descriptors (120), the regularities that can be reasonably looked for are, per force, of limited complexity. One first question relates to the composition of the interfaces in terms of items. Is this composition special in some ways?

1 This was done using the CGAL librairy [1].

3.1 Analysis of the frequencies of items  Suppose we observe that a given item, say (SHP ), oc- curs 150 times in all (over the 10,000 items taken alto- gether) and is present in 50 out of the 459 interfaces. What should we think? Is this feature normal? Mildly surprising?

Quite astonishing? One that could be used as a ?signature? of a likely interface between proteins?

To answer this question necessitates that expectation un- der ?normal circumstances? be defined (a.k.a. as a ?null hy- pothesis?) and that deviations from it can give rise to proba- bility assessments. The question is akin to ask what should be the number of each item given the surface composition of the proteins making the compound. In the following, the term semi-interface (possibly associated with a subscript) denotes the half belonging to a protein in an interface.

In order to compute the probability associated with each item A (e.g. (S + +)), one can measure the probability that it would appear as the result of the combination of half- items AiAj (e.g. (S + +) could result from (S ! ++) or from (+ ! S+). In general, given that an event A can result from pairs of sub-events AiAj , its expected number nA under the binomial assumption2 is:  E[nA] = ? i,j  aij ? p(Ai) ? p(Aj) ?N (1)  where p(X) is the probability of the item X as measured in the interfaces, N is the total number of events and aij = 1 if Ai = Aj or aij = 2 if Ai <> Aj . And the variance is given by:  V ar[nA] = (?  i,j  aij ?p(Ai)?p(Aj) )(  1? ? i,j  aij ?p(Ai)?p(Aj) ) N  (2) For instance, suppose again that one is interested in the  (S + +) item. One would measure the probability of hav- ing the semi-item (S), (+), (++) and (S+) in order to get: E[n(S++)] = 2  ( p(S) ? p(++) + p(+) ? p(S+)  ) N , where  p(x) would be the observed frequency of the semi-item x in all semi-interfaces, and N be the number of items in all 459 interfaces, that is 10,000 (the factor 2 comes from the fact that  (? i,j p(Ai) ? p(Aj)  ) =  (? i,i p(Ai) ? p(Ai)  ) +  (?  i,j,i<j p(Ai) ? p(Aj) )  which reflects the fact that the same item can be obtained with an Ai coming from either semi-interface).

One important caveat in our case is that no combination of semi-items should be considered that lead to items with more than 4 elements (tetrahedra). This must be taken care of in the computation of formula 1 and 2.

2 I.e. independent and identical trials.

3.2 Analysis of the combinations of items  It can be expected that what determines the strong cou- pling between the complex structures of proteins are com- binations of elementary geometrical items. It is therefore interesting to look for combinations that would be very dif- ferently represented than what should be expected under a null hypothesis where the items would be independent.

In general, the expected number of a m-combination of m items Ai,Aj , . . . ,Ak? ?? ?  m  is:  E[nAB] = ?l=i,j,...,k ai,...,k ? p(Al) N  and the variance:  V ar[nA] = ( ?l=i,j,,k ai,,k?p(Al)  )( 1??l=i,j,,k ai,,k?p(Al)  ) N  with N the number of observed items of size k and ai,,k the number of permutations of Ai, . . . , Ak.

3.3 Combing the items and combinations  Underrepresented items, while of possible predictive value (their absence in an candidate interface could be con- sidered as a telltale sign of a possible interface), are not to be retained if the goal is to discover elements that are respon- sible for the binding of protein-protein complexes. We keep therefore the items (or the combinations of items) of which the observed number in the known interfaces exceeds its ex- pected number by more than twice the standard deviation: nobsX ? E[nX ] + 2  ? V ar[nX ]. Under the normal distri-  bution assumption, the probability of observing nobsX events or more is then less that 2.5% 3. This rather conservative threshold contributes to yield few false positive elements. 4.

In the same spirit, we would rather identify elements that seem well correlated to as large as possible a fraction of all known interfaces. This means both that they are signifi- cantly over represented (as detected by the above statistical criterion) and that they intervene in a sufficiently large num- ber of interfaces. The number of interfaces in which a given element X takes part is called the coverage of the element and is noted cov(X). A single threshold on the minimal coverage of elements of interest will select the elements that play a role in at least that many interfaces or fraction of the interfaces. For instance, in our study, we chose a 5% thresh- old for the minimal coverage of elements to be considered for further analysis.

3 Strictly speaking, the probability of measuring nobsX outside the range [E[nX ] ? 1.96  p V ar[nX ]] is less than 5%. For symmetry reasons,  p ` nobsX ? E[nX ] + 1.96  p V ar[nX ]  ? < 2.5%. This is also known  as the p-value.

4 For instance, if one keeps all items with nobsX ? E[nX ] +p V ar[nX ], then there is a 16% chance that this happened under the null  hypothesis.

3.4 Measuring the spread of the elements and its atypical character  It is also informative to know if a given element (an item or a combination of items) tends to occur in a widespread fashion among the interfaces or, on the contrary, in a con- centrated way. In the former case, this might indicate a necessary ingredient in at least one type of bonds between proteins. In the latter case, this could be interpreted as the sign of a kind of autocatalytic reaction that favors the co- occurrence of a same element inside interfaces. Either way, one must be able to measure to which degree an element is more widespread or more concentrated than normal.

To do this, we propose to compare the measured cover- age of elements with their expected coverage.

The coverage of an element is easily computed from the database of known instances. The computation of its ex- pected coverage, on the other hand, requires some caution.

Suppose that a given element has been observed to occur n times. The idea is to calculate the number of different interfaces among I (e.g. 459) that can receive at least one element when n elements of the same type are drawn inde- pendently within N elements.

Suppose that the average number of elements in each in- terface is K = N/I , and let k be the number of a given element in a given interface. Then k is the size of the in- tersection between a set of n elements drawn independently from N and a set of K elements also drawn from N . The hypergeometrical equation gives:  p(k) =  ( n k  )( N?n K?k  )( N K  ) In particular, the probability of having a void interface  (w.r.t. the element of interest) is:  p(0) =  ( n  )( N?n K?0  )( N K  ) = (N?nK )( N K  ) And the expected number of non void interfaces is:  I ? p(0) = I ? (  1? ( N?n  K  )( N K  ) ) Several cases can occur that deserve to be considered:  1. The number of observed elements is greater than the number of expected elements AND the observed cov- erage is larger than the expected one. This means that the element is over-represented and is overspread in the known instances. It might therefore be thought of as playing a key role in the binding of proteins.

2. The number of observed elements is greater than the number of expected elements AND the observed cov- erage is less than the expected one. This means that the  element is over-represented and concentrated on some interfaces. This may suggest a kind of autocatalytic process involving the element.

3. The number of observed elements is less than the num- ber of expected elements AND the observed coverage is larger than the expected one. The element is under- represented and is overspread in the known instances.

It might be accidentally associated with the interfaces.

4. The number of observed elements is less than the num- ber of expected elements AND the observed coverage is less than the expected one. The element is under- represented and concentrated on some interfaces.

4 Results on the protein-protein interfaces  4.1 Item selection  459 protein-protein complexes have been extracted from the PDB database, and have been described using weighted alpha shapes (with alpha=0), corresponding to approxi- mately 10,600 items (edges, triangles and tetrahedra). In this description, each interface has been found to involve between 15 to 50 items. There are 120 different items when the amino acids are clustered into five groups. For each one of these items, the total number of occurrences and the coverage have been measured, while the expected number of occurrences (with standard deviation) and the expected coverage have been computed (see the bar chart in figure 2).

We then automatically extracted the items that satisfied a combination of the three criteria:  ? Overrepresentation.

When nobsX ? E[nX ] + C  ? V ar[nX ], with C = 2  when selecting items, and C = 1 or C = 2 when selecting patterns.

? Minimum coverage.

A threshold of 5% or 7% was used for the selection of patterns. None was used when selecting items.

? Difference with expected coverage.

When cov(X) > E[cov(X)].

The list of selected items is then: {+-, SSP, SHP, SPP, SP?, S+-,HHH, HHP, HH+, HP+,H+-, PP+, P+-,++-}.

It is noteworthy that items known as poor candidates such as: ??, ++, ???, +++ have been rejected. On the other hand, items corresponding to mildly hydrophobic or strongly hydrophobic elements have been retained, such as HHH , HHP , HH+, as well as electrically charged ele- ments such as +?, S+?, H+?, P+?, ++?. All of these items are indeed expected to play a role in protein-protein interfaces since they tend to favor stable conformations.

Items that are over-represented (C=2, results in bold, and C=1) and cover at least 5% of the interfaces. Results for C=1 are a superset of the results for C=2.

4.2 Pattern selection  The same analysis was carried over for the combinations of items, including doublets, triplets, and quadruplets (no quintuplet were found to satisfy the selection criteria). In order to test the robustness of the results, another selection was also carried out using C = 1 for the overrepresentation criterion and a minimal coverage threshold of 5%.

Regarding the doublets and the triplets, one can notice a slight overrepresentation of the groups with amino acids  belonging to the hydrophobic group H . In general, how- ever, the items are paired according to global properties.

Two groups of patterns emerge. One with a high propor- tion of hydrophobic amino acids H , the other with opposite charges + and -. Only in one instance, these properties are found together: HH+/++-.

As for the quadruplets, it is noticeable that hydrophobic amino acids are predominant. The electric charges + and - equilibrate each other, and there is a positive charge + left.

The groups with hydrophobic amino acids takes over.

Calculations were also carried out imposing a minimal coverage threshold of 7%, but with the less stringent con- dition C = 1. The results show a large agreement with the ones obtained for C = 2, except for the triplets. A finer analysis is under way to look whether this discrepancy is profound or not.

Doublets: {+-/+-, SSP/SSP, SHP/SHP, S+-/S+-, HHH/HHH, HHH/HHP, HHH/HH+, HHH/H+-, HHP/HH+, HHP/HP+, HH+/HH+, HH+/HP+, H+-/H+-, H+-/++-} Triplets: {+-/H+-/H+-, SHP/SHP/SHP, H+-/H+-/S+-, H+-/HH+/HHH, H+-/H+-/HH+} Quadruplets: {H+-/HH+/HHH/HHH}  5. Discussion and future work  Protein docking introduces very challenging problems.

In this work, we relied on a low-resolution geometrical de- scription of protein-protein interfaces. By contrast with the usual scoring functions that rely on aggregations of mul- tiple factors, the method we propose searches for (geo- metrical) patterns that emerge as strongly correlated with protein-protein interfaces. One important advantage of this approach is that it naturally adapts to the discovery of dis- junctive concepts. While ordinary methods may be severely hampered in their performance by the fact that the phe- nomenon at hand might in fact result from several different processes, our method is geared to bring to light such com- pound models (for instance, antibody, enzymes, cytokine, and other interaction classes). Another advantage is that there is no need for constructing artificial decoys (e.g. [5]).

On the other hand, null hypotheses have to be devised in order to test the significance of the number of occurrences of each pattern and of their coverage.

This discovery method can be applied in every context where the representation of the instances involves counts of patterns taken in a dictionary of patterns that is not too large as compared to the number of instances.

It is not difficult to turn the discovered patterns into a predictive tool. It suffices to retain the combinations of pat- terns that are the most statistically significantly associated with the phenomenon and that together cover most or all of the positive known instances. Each combination can then be used as a predictor of potential interfaces in protein-protein complexes.

We applied our method to the data set of 459 protein- protein complexes taken from the Dockground database.

The items and the combinations thereof that were selected point out to the importance of the hydrophobic amino acids and the association of amino acids of opposite charges.

The findings are aligned with what is known about protein- protein complexes.

We tested the robustness of the results against variations in the grouping of the amino acids into five groups (S, P, H, + and -) and in the threshold for selecting significant pat- terns. The results stayed qualitatively the same, with more patterns selected when the selection threshold was made less severe. The value of the alpha parameter for the alpha- shapes should, however, play a much more important role in the kind of patterns discovered by the method. This remains to be systematically studied.
