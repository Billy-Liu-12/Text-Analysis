Mining Fuzzy Rules in A Donor Database for

Abstract   Given a donor database by a charitable organization in Hong Kong, we propose to use a new data mining technique to discover fuzzy rules for direct marketing.

The discovered fuzzy rules employ linguistic terms, which are natural for human users to understand because of the affinity with the human knowledge representations, to represent the association relationships revealed in the data.  The proposed approach utilizes an objective measure to distinguish interesting associations from uninteresting ones.  Furthermore, it allows the ranking of discovered rules according to an uncertainty measure and allows quantitative values to be inferred by the discovered fuzzy rules.  The domain expert from the organization is interested at finding how the response of a donor is affected by his demographics (e.g., age, education, occupation, salary, etc.) and his donation histories (e.g., the average yearly donation frequency, the average monthly donation amount, etc.).  We applied the proposed approach to the donor database in order to mine a set of fuzzy rules.  The experimental results showed that our approach is able to achieve accurate prediction of donor?s response.  By examining the discovered rules, the domain expert has found some unexpected patterns and formulated some direct mail strategies for future use.

1.  Introduction   In this paper, we describe how to discover interesting rules for direct marketing in a donor database given by a charitable organization in Hong Kong.  The name of the organization is kept confidential upon its request.  The domain expert from the organization is interested at finding how the response of a donor is affected by his demographics (e.g., age, education, occupation, salary, etc.) and his donation histories (e.g., the average yearly donation frequency, the average monthly donation  amount, etc.).  In order to reveal association relationships hidden in the data, existing data mining algorithms (e.g., [1-2, 14, 16]) are typically developed to deal with crisp values and the association rules discovered may therefore be difficult for human users to understand.  Furthermore, these algorithms require human users to supply two thresholds, minimum support and minimum confidence, to determine whether an association is interesting or not.  A weakness of such approach lies in the difficulty in deciding what these thresholds should be.

To allow human users to better understand the associations, we propose to use a new data mining technique to discover fuzzy rules in the donor database.

The discovered fuzzy rules employ linguistic terms, which are natural for human users to understand because of the affinity with the human knowledge representations, to represent the revealed association relationships.  The use of linguistic terms, which are in turn defined by fuzzy sets, also allows the proposed approach to be resilient to noises in the data.

Furthermore, the proposed approach uses residual analysis [3-7] to distinguish interesting associations from uninteresting ones.  This measure can be considered as an objective interestingness measure because it does not require any user-specified thresholds.  In addition to using the objective interestingness measure, our approach also allows quantitative values to be inferred by the discovered fuzzy rules.

Applying our approach in the donor database, it is able to mine a set of fuzzy rules concerning with donor?s response.  Based on the discovered fuzzy rules, the domain expert is able to formulate direct marketing strategies for future use.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows.  In Section 2, we describe the related work.  The donor database is described in Section 3.  The details of the proposed approach are given in Section 4.  In Section 5, we discuss the experiments and the results on applying     our approach to the donor database.  Finally, in Section 6, we conclude this paper with a summary.

2.  Related work   Association rule mining is originally defined in [1] over Boolean attributes in market basket data and has been extended to handle categorical and quantitative attributes [16].  In its most general form, an association rule is defined over attributes of a database universal relation, T.  It is an implication of the form X ? Y where X and Y are conjunctions of conditions.  A condition is either Ai = ai where ai ? dom(Ai) if Ai is categorical or Ai ? [li, ui] ? ? if Ai is quantitative.  The association rule X ? Y holds in T with support defined as the percentage of tuples satisfying X and Y and confidence defined as the percentage of tuples satisfying Y given that they also satisfy X.  An association rule is interesting if its support and confidence are greater than or equal to the user- specified minimum support and minimum confidence, respectively.  A weakness of such approach is that many users do not have any idea what the thresholds should be.

If it is set too high, a user may miss some useful rules but if it is set too low, the user may be overwhelmed by many irrelevant ones [8-9].

To handle quantitative attributes, many data mining algorithms (e.g., [12, 16]) require the domain of these attributes to be discretized into crisp intervals.  The discretization can be performed as a part of the algorithms (e.g., [16]) or as a pre-processing step before data mining (e.g., [12]).  After the domain of quantitative attributes has been discretized, algorithms for mining Boolean association rules (e.g., [1-2, 14]) can be applied to the discretized data.  The discovered association rules can be used later for user examinations and machine inferences, e.g., classification [12].

Regardless of how the values of quantitative attributes are discretized, the intervals might not be concise and meaningful enough for human users to easily obtain nontrivial knowledge from association rules discovered.  Linguistic summaries introduced in [17] express knowledge in linguistic representation, which is natural for human users to comprehend.  In addition to linguistic summaries, an interactive top-down summary discovery process, which utilizes fuzzy is-a hierarchies as domain knowledge, has been described in [11].  This technique aims at discovering a set of generalized tuples.

Unlike association rules, which involve implications between different attributes, linguistic summaries and generalized tuples provide summarization on different attributes only.  The idea of implication has not been taken into consideration and hence these techniques are not developed for the task of rule discovery.

Furthermore, the applicability of fuzzy modeling techniques to data mining has been discussed in [10].

Given a relational table, X, and a context variable, A, the context-sensitive fuzzy clustering method aims at revealing structure in X in the context of A.  Since this method can only manipulate quantitative attributes, the values of categorical attributes are first encoded into numeric values.  It is then applied to the encoded data for inducing clusters in context A.  Although the encoding technique allows this method to deal with categorical attributes, the distances between the encoded numeric values, which do not possess any meaning in the original categorical attributes, are used to induce clusters.  The associations concerned with these attributes discovered by this method may therefore be misleading.

Furthermore, an information-theoretic fuzzy approach has been proposed in [13] to discover unreliable data in databases.  This approach first defines some attributes as input or target attributes in a given relational database and then constructs a connectionist network to evaluate the reliability of values of target attributes in every record as a fuzzy measure.  Unreliable values of target attributes can be removed from the database or corrected to the values predicted by the network.  In addition to evaluating data reliability, the highest connection weights in the network can also be translated into a set of production rules.  Although the information- theoretic fuzzy approach is able to evaluate the reliability degree of data as a fuzzy measure, it requires the domains of quantitative attributes to be discretized into crisp intervals.  To better handle quantitative data, it can be further extended to use fuzzy variables to represent quantitative attributes.

3.  The donor database   The donor database contains the data collected in a direct mail campaign launched in April 2001.  In this campaign, the organization sent mails to single-gift donors who had made at least one donation during the period between April 1999 and March 2001.  A single-gift donor is defined as a person who does not commit to donate regularly but has made one-off donation occasionally.  The organization sent direct mails to these single-gift donors in the campaign to ask for repeated donations and to persuade them to donate regularly.  In the direct mail campaign, the organization sent mails to 65,152 donors and 7,634 of them responded.  In other words, the response rate is 11.7%.

The donor database is stored in a commercial relational database management system and is composed of 5 relations.  These relations and their descriptions are given in Table 1 below.

Table 1.  Summary of the relations in the donor database.

Relation Description DonorMaster Demographics of donors, e.g., gender,  age, occupation, etc.

DonationHistory Donation histories of donors, e.g., date of  donation, amount of donation, etc.

PromotionHistory Direct mails that the donors received,  e.g., direct mail campaign, date, etc.

SourcesInformation Details of direct mail materials, e.g., type  of materials, distribution date, etc.

EventHistory Activities that donors participated in,  e.g., event, attendance, etc.

The domain expert from the organization aims at finding how the response of a donor is affected by his demographics, the direct mail materials he received, the activities he attended, etc. so as to formulate direct marketing strategies for future use.  Using the data transformation technique proposed in [7], the donor database is transformed into a new relation, which consists of 65,152 tuples.  Of these tuples, 7,634 (i.e., 11.7%) are respondents and the remaining 57,518 (i.e., 88.3%) are non-respondents.  We refer to this relation as the donor relation in the rest of this paper.  Each tuple in the donor relation is characterized by 93 attributes, of which 49 attributes are categorical and the remaining 44 attributes are quantitative.  These attributes can be grouped into six different categories listed in the following:  ? Demographic data of donors; ? Past donation behaviors of donors; ? Reponses of donors to the pervious direct mail  campaigns; ? Themes of direct mails that donors responded to; ? Promotion materials that donors responded to; and ? Events that donors participated in.

After the data transformation, we can apply the proposed fuzzy data mining approach to the donor relation and present the discovered fuzzy rules to the domain expert for formulating direct mail strategies.

4.  A fuzzy approach for data mining   Our approach is capable of mining fuzzy rules in large databases without any need for user-specified thresholds or mapping of quantitative into binary attributes.  A fuzzy rule describes an interesting relationship between two or more linguistic terms.  The definition of linguistic terms is presented in Section 4.1.

The details of this approach are then given in Section 4.2.

In Section 4.3, we describe how interesting fuzzy rules can be identified.  A confidence measure, called weight of  evidence [3-7], is then defined in Section 4.4 to provide a means for representing the uncertainty associated with the fuzzy rules.  In Section 4.5, we describe how to predict unknown values using the discovered fuzzy rules.

4.1.  Linguistic terms   Given a set of records, D, each of which consists of a set of attributes J = {I1, ?, In}, where Iv, v = 1, ?, n, can be quantitative or categorical.  For any record, d ? D, d[Iv] denotes the value iv in d for attribute Iv.  For any quantitative attribute, Iv ? J, let dom(Iv) = [lv, uv] ? ? denote the domain of the attribute.  Based on the fuzzy set theory, a set of linguistic terms can be defined over the domain of each quantitative attribute.  Let us therefore denote the linguistic terms associated with some quantitative attribute, Iv ? J as Lvr, r = 1, ?, sv, so that a corresponding fuzzy set, Lvr, can be defined for each Lvr.

The membership function of the fuzzy set is denoted as  vrL ?  and is defined as:   ]1 ,0[)(: ?vL Idomvr?   The fuzzy sets Lvr, r = 1, ?, sv, are then defined as:   ? ?  ?  ? ?  ?  ?  =  ?  ?  continuous is  if )(  discrete is  if )(  )(  )(  v Idom v  vL  vIdom v  vL  vr  I i  i  I i  i  L  v  vr  v  vr  ?  ?     for all iv ? dom(Iv).  The degree of membership of some value iv ? dom(Iv) with some linguistic term Lvr is given by  vrL ? .

Note that Iv ? J can also be categorical and crisp.  In  such case, let } ..., ,{)( 1 vvmvv iiIdom =  denote the domain of Iv.  In order to handle categorical and quantitative attributes in a uniform manner, we can also define a set of linguistic terms, Lvr, r = 1, ?, mv, for each categorical attribute, Iv ? J, where Lvr is represented by a fuzzy set, Lvr, such that   vr vr  i L  1=   Using the above technique, we can represent the  original attribute, J, using a set of linguistic terms, L = {Lvr | v = 1, ?, n, r = 1, ?, sv} where sv = mv for categorical attributes.  Since each linguistic term is represented by a fuzzy set, we have a set of fuzzy sets, L = {Lvr | v = 1, ?, n, r = 1, ?, sv}.  Given a record,     d ? D, and a linguistic term, Lvr ? L, which is, in turn, represented by a fuzzy set, Lvr ? L, the degree of membership of the values in d with respect to Lvr is given by ])[( vL Idvr? .  In other words, d is characterized by the  term Lvr to the degree ])[( vL Idvr? .  If 1])[( =vL Idvr? , d is completely characterized by the term Lvr.  If  0])[( =vL Idvr? , d is not characterized by the term Lvr at all.  If 1])[(0 << vL Idvr? , d is partially characterized by the term Lvr.

Realistically, d can also be characterized by more than one linguistic term.  Let ? be a subset of integers such that ? = {v1, ?, vm} where v1, ?, vm ? {1, ?, n}, v1 ? ? ? vm and |?| = h ? 1.  We further suppose that J? = {Iv | v ? ?}.  Given any J?, it is associated with a set of linguistic terms, L?r, r = 1, ?, s?, where ?  ?  = ?  ? v  vss .

Each L?r is defined by a set of linguistic terms, LLL ?  mmrvrv ..., ,  .  The degree, )(d  r? ?L , to which d is  characterized by the term L?r is defined as:   ]))[( ..., ,])[(min()( 111 mmrmvrvr  vLvL IdIdd ??? ? =L   D can then be represented by a set of fuzzy data, F, which is characterized by a set of linguistic attributes, L = {L1, ?, Ln}.  For any linguistic attribute, Lv ? L, the value of Lv in a record, t ? F, is a set of ordered pairs such that   )} ,( ..., ), ,{(][ 11 vv vsvsvvvt ?? LLL =  where Lvk and ?vk, k ? {1, ?, sv}, are a linguistic term and its degree of membership, respectively.

For any record, t ? F, let )(to kpq ?LL  be the degree to  which t is characterized by the linguistic terms Lpq and L?k, p ? ?.  )(to  kpq ?LL is defined as:   ) ,min()(  kpqkpq LL to  ?? ??=LL  (1)   We further suppose that  kpq deg  ?LL is the sum of  degrees to which records in F characterized by the linguistic terms Lpq and L?k.  kpqdeg ?LL  is given by:    ? ?  = F  LLLL t  todeg kpqkpq  )( ??  (2)    Based on the linguistic terms, we can apply our approach to mine fuzzy rules in fuzzy data and present them to human users in a way that is much easier to understand.  Due to the use of fuzzy technique blurring the boundaries of adjacent intervals of numeric qualities, our approach is resilient to noise such as inaccuracies in physical measurements of real-life entities.

4.2.  The fuzzy data mining algorithm   It is important to note that a fuzzy rule can be of different orders.  A first-order fuzzy rule can be defined to be a rule involving one linguistic term in its antecedent; a second-order rule can be defined to have two; and a third- order rule can be defined to have three linguistic terms, etc.  Our approach is given in Figure 1 below.

The fuzzy data mining algorithm.

4.3.  Discovering interesting rules in fuzzy data   In order to decide whether a relationship between a linguistic term, L?k, and another linguistic term, Lpq, is interesting, we determine whether    k  pqk kpq  ?  ? ? L  LL LL  by  zedcharacteri records which  todegrees of sum  and by  zedcharacteri records which  todegrees of sum )|Pr( =  (3)   is significantly different from    M pq  pq  L L  by  zedcharacteri records which  todegrees of sum )Pr( =  (4)    where ?? = =  = p  ipu  s  u  s  i  degM 1 1  ?  ?LL .  If this is the case, we  consider the relationship between L?k and Lpq interesting.

The significance of the difference can be objectively evaluated based on the idea of an adjusted residual [3-7] defined as:    kpq  kpq  kpq  z d  ?  ?  ? ? LL  LL LL =  (5)   where  kpq z  ?LL is the standardized residual [3-7] and is  given by:    kpq  kpqkpq  kpq e  eegd z  ?  ??  ? LL  LLLL LL  ? =  (6)   where  kpq e  ?LL is the sum of degrees to which records are  expected to be characterized by L?k and Lpq.  It is defined as:    M  degdeg  e  p  kpuipq  kpq  s  u  s  i ??  === 11 ?  ?  ?  ?  LLLL  LL  (7)   and  kpq ? ? LL  is the maximum likelihood estimate [3-7] of  the variance of kpq  z ?LL  and is given by:      ? ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  ? ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  ?  ? ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  ? ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  ?= ??  ==  M  deg  M  deg p  kpuipq  kpq  s  u  s  i 11 1 1 ?  ?  ?  ? ?  LLLL  LL  (8)   If 96.1>  kpq d  ?LL (the 95 percentiles of the normal  distribution), we can conclude that the discrepancy between Pr(Lpq | L?k) and Pr(Lpq) is significantly different and hence the relationship between L?k and Lpq is interesting.  Specifically, the presence of L?k implies the presence of Lpq.  In other words, it is more likely for a record having both L?k and Lpq.

4.4.  Uncertainty representation   Given that a linguistic term, L?k, is associated with another linguistic term, Lpq, we can form the following fuzzy rule.

][ kpq  wpqk ?? LLLL ?   where  kpq w  ?LL is the weight of evidence measure that is  defined as follows.

Since the relationship between L?k and Lpq is  interesting, there is some evidence for a record to be characterized by Lpq given it has L?k.  The weight of evidence measure is defined in terms of an information theoretic measure known as mutual information.  Mutual information measures the change of uncertainty about the presence of Lpq in a record given that it has L?k is and, in turn, defined as:    )Pr(  )|Pr( log):(  pq  kpq kpqI L  LL LL  ? ? =  (9)   Based on mutual information, the weight of evidence  measure is defined in [3-7] as:     )|Pr(  )|Pr( log  )):(():(  U  U  qi  pik  pqk  qi kpikpq IIw kpq  ?  ?  =  ?=  LL  LL  LLLLLL  ?  ?  ???  (10)    kpq w  ?LL can be interpreted intuitively as a measure of  the difference in the gain in information when a record with L?k characterized by Lpq and when characterized by Lpi, i ? q.  The weight of evidence measure can be used to weigh the significance or importance of fuzzy rules.

Given that L?k is defined by a set of linguistic terms, LLL ?  mmkvkv ..., ,  , we have a high-order fuzzy rule as  follows:   ][  ..., , 11 kpqmm  wkvkv ?LLpqLLL ?   where v1, ?, vm ? ?.

4.5.  Predicting unknown values using fuzzy rules   Given a record, d ? dom(I1) ? ? ? dom(Ip) ? ? ? dom(In), let d be characterized by n attribute values, ?1, ?, ?p, ?, ?n, where ?p is the value to be predicted.

Let Lp, p = 1, ?, sp, be the linguistic terms corresponding to the class attribute, Ip.  We further let lp be a linguistic term with domain } ..., ,{)( 1 ppsppldom LL= .  The value  of ?p is given by the value of lp.  To predict the correct value of lp, our approach searches the fuzzy rules with Lpq ? dom(lp) as consequents.  For any combination of attribute values, ??, p ? ?, of d, it is characterized by a     linguistic term, L?k, to a degree of compatibility, )(dk??L ,  for each k ? {1, ?, s?}.  Given those rules implying the assignment of Lpq, ][ kpqwpqk ?? LLLL ? , for all  k ? ? ? {1, ?, s?}, the evidence for such assignment is given by:   ? ?  ?= ?  ? ??? ? k  dww kkpqpq  )(LLLL  (11)   Suppose that, of the n ? 1 attribute values excluding  ?p, only some combinations of them, ?[1], ?, ?[j], ?, ?[?] with ?[j] = {?i | i ? {1, ?, n} ? {p}}, are found to match one or more rules, then the overall weight of evidence for the value of lp to be assigned to Lpq is given by:   ? =  = ?  ?  ][  j q jpq  ww L  (12)   As a result, the value of ?p is given by  )} ,( ..., ), ,( ..., ), ,{( 11 pp spsqpqp www LLL .  When a crisp  value is to be assigned to ?p, the following methods are used depending on Ip is categorical or quantitative.

In case that Ip is categorical, lp is assigned to Lpc if  wc > wg, g = 1, ?, ps?  and g ? c (13)  where ps?  (? sp) is the number of linguistic terms implied by the rules.  ?p is therefore assigned to ipc ? dom(Ip).

If Ip is quantitative, a new method is used to assign an appropriate value to ?p.  Given the linguistic terms,  ppsp LL  ..., ,1 , and their overall weight of evidence,  psww  ..., ,1 , let )( pL ipu? ?  be the weighted degree of  membership of ip ? dom(Ip) to the fuzzy set Lpu, u ? {1, ?, sp}.  )( pL ipu? ?  is given by:  )()( pLupL iwi pupu ?? ?=?  (14)  where ip ? dom(Ip) and u = 1, ?, sp.  The defuzzified  value, )(  1 U ps  u puLF  =  ? , which provide an appropriate value  for ?p is then defined as:     ?  ? ??  ??  =  ?  ?  ?? =  )( ...

)( ...

For quantitative predictions, we use the percentage error as a performance measure.  Given a set of test records, D, let n be the number of records in D.

For any record, r ? D, let tr be the target value of the class attribute in r and or be the value predicted by our approach.  The percentage error, error, is defined as:   ? ?  ? =  Dr r  rr  o  ot  N error  1  (16)   5.  Experimental Results   The domain expert has defined appropriate linguistic terms for the quantitative attributes in the donor relation.

For example, 5 linguistic terms are defined for attribute AVGEVER, which represents the average amount of monthly donation.  These linguistic terms are shown in Figure 2.

0 200 400 600 800 1000  AGVEVER  D eg  re e  of M  em be  rs hi  p  Very Low Low Medium High Very High    Figure 2.  Linguistic terms for attribute AVGEVER.

As another example, 5 linguistic terms are defined for  attribute FREQEVER, which represents the average number of donations in a year.  These linguistic terms are shown in Figure 3.

We randomly selected 30% (i.e., 19,546 in total) of the tuples in the donor relation for testing by deleting from them the values of attribute RESPONSE, which represents whether a donor responded in the direct mail campaign.  Our approach was then used to mine rules from the rest of the donor relation (i.e., 70% or 45,606 tuples).  The discovered rules were then used to predict the missing RESPONSE values in the test tuples.  Our approach discovered 31,865 rules from the training tuples and the classification accuracy on the test tuples is 63.57%.  Since it is a difficult task, the domain expert     considers the accuracy achieved by the proposed approach is good.

0 2 4 6 8 10  FREQEVER  D eg  re e  of M  em be  rs hi  p  Very Low Low Medium High Very High    Figure 3.  Linguistic terms for attribute FREQEVER.

Furthermore, we ranked and presented the discovered  rules to the domain expert and she found that some of them are very useful in a way that she is able to formulate direct mail strategies for future use based on these rules.

A rule, which the domain expert found to be useful, is given in the following:   Rule 1: ENROLL = Yes ? RESPONSE = Yes [w = 4.45; s = 1.28%; c = 74.33%]   where w, s, and c denote weight of evidence, support, and confidence, respectively.  This rule states that if a donor enrolled on any donor activities or gatherings in the past, he will probably respond to the direct mail he received.

Instead of sending direct mails to all the donors, the domain expert suggests that the organization should send mails to those who enrolled any donor activities or gatherings in the past.

Another rule, which is found to be very useful and related to Rule 1, is:   Rule 2: ENROLL = Yes ? ATTENDED = No ? RESPONSE = Yes [w = 7.67; s = 1.23%; c = 96.41%]   This rule states that if a donor enrolled on any donor  activities or gatherings but he did not attend or his enrollment was not accepted, he will probably respond to the direct mail.  It is important to note that Rule 1?s weight of evidence is greater than Rule 2?s by (7.67 ? 4.45) ? 4.45 = 72.36% but Rule 1?s support is less than Rule 2?s by 0.05% only.  Taking this fact into consideration, the domain expert further suggests that the  organization should send direct mails to the donors who enrolled any donor activities or gatherings but they did not attend or their enrollments were not accepted.  The domain expert considers this rule extremely useful because of the organization?s limited resources.

Let us consider the following rules the domain expert finds useful.

Rule 3: FREQEVER = Medium ? RESPONSE = Yes [w = 1.62; s = 1.39%; c = 28.96%] Rule 4: FREQEVER = High ? RESPONSE = Yes [w = 1.84; s = 0.48%; c = 32.20%] Rule 5: FREQEVER = Very High ? RESPONSE = Yes [w = 3.12; s = 0.09%; c = 53.58%]   These rules state that a donor who donated with  medium to very high frequency in the past will probably respond to the direct mail and the likelihood to respond increases with the donation frequency.  They confirm the rule of thumb that one who donated frequently in the past will be more likely to donate in the future.

6.  Conclusions   Given a donor database by a charitable organization in Hong Kong, our task is to reveal how the response of a donor is affected by his demographics (e.g., sex, age, occupation, education, etc.) and his donation histories (e.g., average yearly donation frequency, average monthly donation amount, etc.).  In order to accomplish the task, we proposed to use a new fuzzy data mining algorithm to discover a set of fuzzy rules from the donor database.

These fuzzy rules employ linguistic terms, which are natural for human users to understand because of the affinity with the human knowledge representations, to represent the interesting association relationships hidden in the data.  To distinguish interesting associations from uninteresting ones, the proposed approach uses residual analysis, which can be considered as an objective interestingness measure because it does not require any user-specified thresholds.  Our approach also allows the ranking of discovered rules according to an uncertainty measure and allows quantitative values to be inferred by the discovered fuzzy rules.

We applied the proposed approach to the donor database and discovered a set of fuzzy rules.  Our approach achieved a classification accuracy of 63.57% and the domain expert from the organization considered the accuracy is good because the task on hand is difficult.

Furthermore, we ranked and presented the discovered rules to the domain expert.  The domain expert found that     the rules are very useful in a way that she can formulate direct mail strategies for future use based on these rules.
