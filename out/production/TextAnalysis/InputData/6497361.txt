Selective Fusion of Out-of-Sequence Measurements with  EK-IMM Estimator

Abstract-In m ultisensor track fusion systems, according to the transmit or processing delay,the measurements can come to the fusion center out of sequence.In order to avoid either a delay in the output or the need for reordering and repro? cessing an entire sequence of measurements, such measure? ments have to be processed as out-of-sequence measurements (OOSMs).Most of the algorithm dealing with OOSMs consid? ered to always process these OOSMs.But sometimes dealing with OOSMs may not bring the improvement of track accu? racy.Instead of always processing the OOSMs, we present a extended Kalman filter(EKF) based selective fusion method for the OOSM.Through assess the impact of OOSM data, deter? mine the threshold and select the OOSMs to be fused.In order to make the algorithm suitable for hybrid stochastic dynamic system,we extension the selective fusion mechanism into the extended Kalman based interacting multiple model(EK-IMM) estimator. Simulation results are presented using measurements from Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast(ADS-B) and Secondary Surveillance Radar(SSR).lt is shown that selective fusion with EK-IMM estimator can reduce computational costs while maintaining near optimal performance.

INTRODUCTION  In multisensor track fusion system, the measurements of the same target from different sensors can arrive at the fusion center out of sequence(disordered).These measurements are called out of sequence measurements(OOSMs).For exam? ple, in modern air traffic control(ATC) system, the position of one aircraft can be obtained from secondary surveil? lance radar(SSR) and Automatic Dependent Surveillance? Broadcast(ADS-B) system.According to the transmit delay or the the rotation period of radar, the measurments from SSR   sometimes can be delayed, and result in OOSMs problem.

Directly discarding the out-of-sequence measurement will result in low surveillance accuracy. Standard filters(such as Kalman filter,Particle filter,etc) cannot be directly applied to the out-of-sequence measurement problem. Reprocessing the measurements in a sequence way will need more computa? tion time and storage amount.How to process the OOSMs with less storage amount and computation time,keeping high surveillance accuracy is a problem.

Bar Shalom developed the optimal procedure for incorporat? ing an I-step lag measurement into a Kalman filter (KF) and showed that a simpler algorithm, designated as B [2](origi? nated in [ I]), is nearly optimal for processing such an OOSM.

Algorithm BI [3] generalized algorithm B for an I-step lag OOSM.However, algorithm BI requires I steps to carry out the update. Subsequently, [4] showed that an I-step lag OOSM can be processed similarly to an I-step OOSM, in one single step via another algorithm called Bll, rather than in I steps that would be required by algorithm B/.When the maneuver? ing of the target is nonlinear, the effect of the Kalman filter based OOSM processing method will be not so well.Because the IMM filter has the excellent performance of target track? ing, so it is always used in the air traffic control(ATC) system.

[6] designed an interacting multiple model(lMM) filter for the ATC system. [5] considered the problem of maneuvering target tracking in clutter with OOSM,and gives an AS-IMM? PDA algorithm. [7]presented an algorithm for incorporating OOSMs into the (nonlinear) IMM estimator via the Bll approach.However, the IMM filter is more complex than the KF filter,so the computation amount is a little bit higher. [9] and [10] give an selective fusion of the OOSMs policy, and achieve the similar performance with the always fusing pol? icy. The selective fusion method is applied to the measurement extrapolation Kalman filter(MEKF), augmented state Kalman filter(ASKF) and minimum storage filter.All the filters used in the selective fusion method is linear Kalman filter.We consider to extension the selective fusion mechanism of the OOSM into the non-linear system using the IMM filter.

In this paper, we will show the combination of selective fusion method and the interacting multiple model filter.

First,we give a extended Kalman filter(Bll approach) based selective fusion method for the OOSM.We combinate the signal-to-noise ratio(SNR) based selective fusion mechanism and the Bll approach. Then we extend this method to the IMM estimator.A fusion threshold is given to each filter used in the IMM estimator. Each filter will assess the impact of the OOSM on the estimation fusion based on the singal? to-noise ratio(SNR).lf the impact of the OOSM exceed the fusion threshold, the OOSM is considered to be filtered. On the contrary, the OOSM will not be processed. The advantage of this method is that only those affecting OOSMs are used    for the fusion.In some cases, the OOSMs has little impact on the fusion result, so we do not have to deal with this part of the OOSMs. This provides the opportunity to modify existing delay-handling algorithms to selectively fuse only those measurements important for filtering. Motivation for exploring such a methodology is provided by two sources of potential saving. First, the computational burden of fusing out-of-sequence measurements may be significantly reduced. Second, the nolinear interacting multple model filter has better tracking performance when the maneuvering of the target is nonlinear.

This paper is orgnazied as follows:Section II presents the formulation of the problem.Section III gives a selective fu? sion of OOSMs with extended Kalman filter.Bll approach and the selective fusion mechanism are combined. Section IV extend the extended Kalman filter based selective fusion method to nolinear maneuvering target,which combine the EK-IMM estimator and the selective fusion mechanism to? gether.Simulation results are presented in Section V.Section VI presents conclusions.

2. FORMULATION OF THE PROBLEM  The state of the system is assumed to evolve from time tk-1 to time tk according to  x(k) = fk(x(k - 1), v(k, k - 1)) (1) where, using only the index of the time arguments,jk is the known system state nonlinear functions from time tk-1 to time tk and v(k, k - 1) is the zero-mean Gaussian process noise for this interval. The order of the arguments in both A and v(k, k - 1) are according to the convention for the transition matrices. Typically, the process noise has a single argument, but here two arguments will be needed for clarity because the time td, when the OOSMs was make,assumed to be such that  (2)  This will require the evaluation of the effect of the process noise over an arbitrary non integer number of sampling inter? vals.Note that I = 1 corresponds to the case where the lag is a fraction of a sampling interval; for simplicity this is called the l-step-Iag problem,even though the lag is really a fraction of a time step.

The measurement equation is  z(k) = hk(X(k), w(k)) (3) with the standard assumptions about the noises as zero-mean, white with covariances  E[v(k,j)v(k,j)'] = Q(k,j),E(w(k)w(k)'] = R(k) (4) and mutually uncorrelated. The problem is as follows. At time t = tk one has  x(klk) = E[x(k)IZ(k)], P(klk) = cov[x(k)IZk] (5) where the cumulative set of measurements at tk is  (6)  Subsequently, the earlier measurement from time td, z(d) = hd(X(d), w(d)) (7)   Measurement ----,-----?--,------,------__,c_-? arrival time  ADS-B measurement anival rime  ?SSR l?eas?ement arnval tune  Figure 1.

Figure 1 shows the out of sequence measurements problem in the ADS-B and SSR multisensor track fusion system.

3. SELECTIVE FUSION OF OOSMs WITH EXTENDED KALMAN FILTER  One step Extedded Kalmanfilter for OOSMs  Bar Shalom,et al proposed the one step solution for the update of OOSMs [4],which is called the Bll approach. Here we extend this algorithm to the extended Kalman filter,which performs better in the nonlinear case. Suppose x(klk) is the state estimate at time tk .The time index of the OOSMs is td ,and the OOSMs is Zd .The retrodiction of the state to td from tk is  x(dlk) = fdlk(X(klk), 0) (10) The covariances associated with the state retrodiction are calucated as  Pvv(k, dlk) = G(dlk)Q(k, d)G(dlk)' (11 )  Pxv(k, dlk) = Pvv(k, dlk) -P(klk -1)S*(k)-l Pvv(k, dlk) (12)  where  S*(k)-l = P(klk _ l ) -1 -P(klk _ l ) -1 x [P(klk _ l ) -1 + R(k)-l]-l P(klk _ l)-1  The covariance for the state retrodiction is  (13)  P(dlk) F(dlk)[P(klk) + Pvv(k, dlk) -Pxv(k, dlk) -FTV(k, dlk)']F(dlk)' (14)  where  F(dlk) = 8idlk(X(k), v(k)) I ox( k) x(k)=x(klk),v(k)=O (15)    G(dlk) = Ofdlk (X (k ) , v(k))  I oV(k) x(k)=i(kl k) ,v(k )=0 The convariance for the retrodicted measurement is  S(d) = H(d)P(dlk)H(d)' + U(d)R(d)U(d)'  where  (16)  (17)  H(d) = Ohd (X (d) , w(d))  I (18) ox( d) x(d)=x(dlk),w(d)=O U(d) =  Ohd (X (d) , w(d)) I (19) ow(d) x(d)=x(dlk),w(d)=O  The covariance between the state at time k and this measure? ment is caluated as  Pxz(k, dlk) = [P(klk) - Pxv(k, dlk)]F(dlk)' H(d)' (20)  The gain used for the update is  W(k, d) = Pxz(k, dlk)S(d)-l (21)  The update with the OOSM z(d) of the most recent state estimate x(klk) is  x(kld) = x(klk) + W(k,d)[z(d) - z(dlk)] (22)  where the predicted OOSM is  z(dlk) = hd(X(dlk),O) (23)  and the retrodicted state x(dlk) is given by (10).

The calculated covariance for the update state estimate is  P(kld) = P(klk) - Pxz(k, dlk)S(d)-l Pxz(k, dlk)' (24)  In addition to the above, one has the following algorithm? specific requirements:  ALGORIT HM EK-BlI Computation of P(klk-l) and S*(k) will need to store the following quantities:  1) ti, i = k - lmax, ... ,k - 1 requires lmax scalars indicating the time stamps of measurement sequence,  2) P(k - lmaxlk - lmax), ... ,P(k - 11k - 1) requires lmaxn(n + 1)/2 scalars of the covariances corresponding to the state update sequence.

Fusion threshold  Selective fusion of the OOSM with Kalman filter is proprosed in [9 ] and [10] by D.K.Tasoulis,et al.Most of the algorithms for OOSMs problem have to fuse the delayed measure? ments.However,it is proved that the OOSMs do not have to be fused sometimes, when the OOSMs have little impact on the fusion track.Threshold technique is used to determine whether to fuse the OOSM or not.More specifically, we can modify the delay-handling methods by introducing a thresh? old, called the fusion threshold (FT). Delayed measurements are only incorporated when this norm exceeds FT, meaning that it will have ample impact on the filtering procedure.

Presently, we treat FT as a free parameter and explore its impact for a range of values. For the one step Kalman filter with OOSMs,let z(d) denote the bias between the delayed measurement and the retrodiction target state:  z(d)=z(d) - H(d)x(dlk) =z(d) - H(d)F(dlk)x(klk) (25)   z( d) is iteratively updated, from the moment a measurement is delayed up until either the measurement arrives or the threshold condition is satisfied.At each time step that the delayed measurement has not arrived, if Ilz(d)11 > FT then the fusing procedure is dropped. Thus,all subsequent computations to update z( d) are saved,and the operation of the filter continues normally.

,' . _ {X(kld) x(klk, d) - x(klk)  Ilz(d)11 ::; FT Ilz(d)11 > FT  (26)  where FT is the fusion threshold. There are many ways to set the value of FT .Because z( d) is the bias of the mea? surement,so the covariance of the out of sequence measure? ment has constraint on z(d).From (15),the covariance of the OOSM is  S(d) Var(z(d) - H(d)x(dlk)) R(d) + H(d)P(dlk)H(d)'  ? R(d) + H(d)F(dlk)P(klk)F(dlk)' H(d)(27) Under the gaussian assumption of the measurement error,so the probability density function(pdf) of z( d) is  pdj(z(d)) = 1 e-ri(d)'S(d)-'z(d) (28)  IS(d)11/2? Because the measurements from ADS-B or radar are very  Figure 2. Probability distribution function with covariance Sed)  accurate, so the variances of ADS-B and radar data are very small.Figure 2 shows the probability density function z(d) It is obvious that z( d) has direct impact on the performance of the covariance of the fi Iter.ln order to make sure that the performance of the estimate more accuracy, II z( d) II should be small enough.So FT should be a small value which satisfiy that  r pdj (z( d) )dz( d) = 1 - c (29) Jllz(d)II?FT where c is a pre-defined constant. For simplify,we give another condition that  pdj(llz(d)11 ::; FT) :::-. (1 - c)pdj(z(d) = 0) (30) For simplity,we give another condition that  z( d)' S( d) -1 z( d) ::; In(1 - c) This is equal to that  Ilz(d)11 ::; Illn(l- c)S(d)111/2 So we can let FT equals that  FT = Illn(1 - c)S(d)lll/2  (31)  (32)  (33)    4. SELECTIVE FUSION OF OOSMs WITH EK-IMM ESTIMATOR  In fact, the maneuvering of the target is often nonlin? ear.Kalman filter is usually applies to linear target motion, and not suitable for non-linear maneuvering.Nonlinear tar? get tracking filter includes nonlinear interacting multiple model(IMM) filter, particle filter(PF),et al. The computation of PF is expensive. In air traffic control system, the IMM filter is always used to track the aircraft. Therefore, we extend the selective fusion algorithm based on extended Kalman fi Iter to the IMM filter,which will be applied in practice.

There are four steps to update the OOSM:  ? Model conditioned reinitialization; ? Selective fusion of OOSMs with EK-Bll; ? Model probability update; ? Update of the current combined estimate and covariance.

Selective-IMM-OOSM and its computation struc? ture  Figure 3 illustrates the computation structure involved for each of ]v! models in one cycle of the Selective-IMM? OOSM recursion.The strucure of Selective-IMM-OOSM is very similar to that of the IMM filter.The difference between them is that the filter used in each model of the Selective? IMM-OOSM is based on the selective fusion based EK? Bll approach. One cycle of Selective-IMM-OOSM recursion involves following major steps:  Model-conditional reinitialization  A class of stochastic hybrid systems with additive noise can be described as  x(k) = JIklk - 1, m(k), x(k - 1), v(k - 1)] (34) whereJIklk - 1, m(k), x(k - 1), v(k - 1)] is the state tran? sation matrix from time tk-l to time tk with model m(k).M is the number of maneuvering models in the stochastic hybrid systems.v(k - 1) is the process noise.

The measurement equation is  z(k) = h[k, m(k), x(k), w(k)] (35) and the "system mode" is a homogeneous Markov chain with probabilities of transition given by   M is the set of model states (i.e., models). The model of the target at time tk-l is mi,and is mj at time tk,the mixing probability  fLilj(k - 1 1k - 1) = (l/cj)'TrijILi(k - 1) (37) where Cj is a normalization factor  (38)  POj(k - 1 1k - 1) L {Pi(k - 1 1k - 1) + x X x'}  XfLilj(k - 1 1k - 1) (40) where x = xi(k - 1 1k - 1) - xOj(k - 1 1k - 1).

Selective fusion of OOSMs with EK-Bll  There are M models in the IMM filter.The OOSMs should first be updated in each model using the EK-Bll filter with selective fusion.According to section liThe fusion threshold of modeli is FTi .Let T} 1VI 1\1 denote the bias of the delayed measurement to be incorporated at time step tk .

ThvllVI = z(d) -H(d)xi(d, klk) (41) The value of FTi has very important impact on the estimation result.If FTi is too large, most of II T} 1VI 1VI II will be smaller than FTi,so most of the OOSMs will have to be processed using the Bll approach.As a result, the computation time of the algorithm will be longer.lf FTi is too small, most of II TJ 1\1 1VI II will be larger than FTi ,so most of the OOSMs do have to be dropped.As a result, the computation time of the algorithm will be shorter. There is a suitbale value of FTi,which will give us shorter computation time and good estimation accuracy. According to the selective fusion proce? dure given in the previous section,the threshold of model i set in the algorithm should be  (42)  If II T} 1VI 1\1 II > FTi ,the fusing procedure of model i is dropped. Then the output of the state estimate and covariance are  (klzk, z(d)) = xi(klk) pi(kld) = pi(klk)  (43) (44)  If II T} 1VI 1VI II ? FTi,then the OOSM will be updated using the Bll approach described in section II. The procedure is described in Table I.

The likelihood function of each model is evaluated based on the OOSM and the corresponding retrodiction from the current time. The likelihood function of mode i based on the OOSM from time td is  Ai(d) = 12'TrSi(dlk)I-1/2  exp {-? [Z(d) -zi(dlk)l'Si(dlk)(-lJ[z(d) -zi(dlk)]} (45)    Table 1.

Each model at time tk has its probability JLi(klk).The model probability at time tk(before the OOSM) is  ,which are to be updated with the OOSM into  according to  M  ILi(kld) = -;-:[L Aj(d)IIij]/Li(klk) j=l where the normalization constant is  M M C = L L Aj(d)IIljJL1(klk)  1=1 j=l  (47)  (48)  (49)  (50)   Update o{the C urrent Combined Estimate and Covariance  The new combined estimate, after the OOSM, is M  x(kld) = L xj(kld)JLj(kld) (51) j=l  and its covariance is M  P(kld) = L JLj(kld) j=l  {pj (kid) + [xj (kid) -x(kld)] x [xj (kid) -x(kld)]'} (52)  We call the algorithm presented above Selective-IMM? OOSM,which combines the selective fusion threshold tech? nique and IMM estimator together. The performance of this algorithm has matter with the fusion threshold of each filter PTi. When PTi is big enough, each filter of Selective-IMM?OOSM becomes a BIl filter;then Selective-IMM-OOSM has the same performance with IMM-OOSM [7]. When PT i is small enough, xi(klk) and pi(klk) can be directly used as the output of each filter;thus the computation cost can be re? duced.Because the selective mechanism depend on IITIMM II and PT i can assess the impact of OOSMs on the fusion estimation, the accuracy of the result can be guaranteed [10].

5. SIMULATION STUDY  We consider a aircraft tracking problem with latitude,longitude and height measurements from ADS-B,as well as range,azimuth and elevation measurements from radar. The aircaft per? forms complex maneuvering movements in the air.The two sensors get the position information from the aircraft asyn? chronously.The average update rate of the ADS-B message is 1.0 second,and the average of the radar data update rate is 5.0 seconds. Sometimes the radar message can become OOSMs. We choose a period of data with out of sequence measurement. The duration of the data we choosed is about 100 seconds with one out of sequence measurement at the last.The trajectory of the aircraft is showed in figure(3) be- 10w.From figure(3),we can see that the last measurement from the radar is an OOSM.

IMM-OOSM is comparable to that of IMM-OOSM, IMM? ISM,and better than that of Select-ASI<F.

Figure(5) shows the time used by different algorithms with the IIRII (the bias of the OOSM)changing from 2.8 x 1O-7to 4.6 x 1O-7.The lag of the OOSM is I .The runtime of the algorithm(including IMM-OOSM and in sequence IMM) do not change very much when the fusion threshold changes. The in sequence IMM algorithm costs the longest time. The run? time of Selective-IMM-OOSM reduces when the IIRII get larger and larger.Figure(6) shows the runtime of Selective? IMM-OOSM with 2lags OOSMs. It is also shown that the runtime of Selective-IMM-OOSM is the smallest.Figure(7) also shows that the runtime of Selective-IMM-OOSM is the smallest.

Our results show that fusing delayed measurements in a non? linear system can even be worthless. To address this we propose a thresholding technique to reduce the computational cost involved in fusing measurements, by only incorporating measurements that sustain filter performance. We find that most of the filtering performance of each method can be maintained by fusing fewer delayed measurements. Apart from computational savings, this capacity allows computa? tion efficiency in sensor network applications. The proposed automated thresholding procedure also allows data driven control of the selection procedure.
