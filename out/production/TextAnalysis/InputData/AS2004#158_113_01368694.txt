Abstract? Vector-based association rule discovery models have been provided to look for spatial knowledge in terrestrial applications recently. Most of them just consider the attribution relationship of local space or the topological relationship between parcels or objects. And they are difficulty to consider the temporal change, distance relationship or direction relationship.

In this presentation, an geo-event association rule discovery model(GEARDM) is developed, which is based on the spatiotemporal grid and rough set, and the experiment in marine fishery application is provided in support of the model. In GEARDM, the continuous spatiotemporal process is discretized by fuzzy pre-knowledge as spatiotemporal assignment and will be assigned into a decision table. The mining algorithm based on rough set results from the decision table in the geo-event association rules, which shows what kind of pattern of spatiotemporal assignment of environmental factors determine the happen or attribution of the geo_events. After the mined rules being analyzed by knowledge, the refined knowledge is obtained and the spatiotemporal assignment will be renewed.

Then the flow of GEARDM feeds back to the phase of discretization and iterates until the final rules are reasonable.

These knowledge-based rules also can be used in the expert system to predict the happen or the scale of geo-event as the experiments show.

I. INTRODUCTION In the early, association rule was provided and used to look for the association rule among items in business database (Agrawal, 1993; Fayyad, 1996). Later, it entered the spatial domain (Lu et al, 1993; Han, 1996;). According to the rule mined from the environmental database, it can be divided into three categories, spatial characteristic rule, spatial discriminating rule and spatial association rule. For example, (city, on coastline)-&gt;(citizen, high income) is a spatial association.

The characteristic or discriminating rule is generalized from the nonspatial attributions, which associate the spatial position (Lu et al,1993; Han and Fu 1996).

The third kind of rule focuses on the dependency between attributions of one parcel and other parcels, which have topologic relationship (Koperski, 1996). Its arithmetic is complex when judging the topologic relationship through the vector database and the data type of the attribution in these models has to be limited as category. Except the topologic relationship, it is difficulty to take other spatial relationships into account, i.e. spatial position, spatial distance relationship, spatial direction relationship, and the relative value of  attribution. And it is based on the spatial status, which will not be changed with time and has the static topologic relationship.

Additionally, it is based on the terrestrial application, in which the land can be usually divided as parcels by determinate boundaries.  But in the environment research, the continue field also is important research content, especially in meteorology    also is important research content, especially in meteorology and oceanography. (Miller and Han,2001).

Once some attributions at a position or in an area get their values at one time, we may say a geographic event (geo-event) happens. Besides the local attributions, geo-event often depends on the condition around the position (Ester,1999;Miller,2000).  The condition includes the temporal attribution, the position of the objects, topological relationship, spatial distance relationship, spatial direction relationship and the attribution value with the relative values among these objects. We define this condition as spatiotemporal assignment (Su et al, 2001). According to the definition of geo-event, the spatiotemporal assignment will change with time.

In the recent years, the oceanography and marine fishery has been benefiting from GIS technology and also the GIS has been benefiting from oceanography and marine fishery (Wright and Goodchild, 1997; Meaden, 2000). But the knowledge- based spatial model has not been integrated with marine till now.

In this work, we developed the Geo-event Association Rule Discovery Model(GEARDM), which is based on the spatiotemporal assignment, and finished an experiment for marine fishery. The continuous spatiotemporal process will be discretized as spatiotemporal assignment and will be assigned into a decision table. From the table, the geo-event association rule will be mined by the algorithm, which base on the  rough set. These rules also can be used in the expert system to predict the happen or the scale of geo-event as the experiments show.

II. GEARDM In this section, we will describe the flow to set up the GEARDM (figure 1).

Firstly, the spatiotemporal process will be discretized as a time serial of space state or geo-event. Secondly, according to the pre-knowledge, a neighborhood will be constructed to obtain the parameter of each geo-event and a decision table will be filled, which can describe the serial of geo-event. Then some original rules will be mined from the table by the method of rough set. Finally, some real rules will be chosen from these original rules by analysis with knowledge. All these steps can feed back. For example, after analyzing the original rules, we get new knowledge, we can re-constructe the neighborhood to obtain more suitable parameter of geo-event to mine more reasonable rules.

The detail technology will be described as follows.

2.1. Spatiotemporal assignment In order to express the spatial assignment, we divide the 2- dimension space as grid. And set the cell in which the geo- event happens as focus. According to the qualitative or fuzzy knowledge, some factors in some areas or points around focus will affect the happen of the geo-event. These areas or points are defined as neighbor. The focus with the neighbor make up of the neighborhood.

The shape of neighborhoods can be a rectangle, a circle, an annulus or a slice of a circle. According to different geo-events, or different themes in a same geo-event, the neighborhood may be defined as different shape, director with distance or resolution.

2.2. Describing the geo-event association rule Definition: A geo-event association rule contains in the form of X?Y    X?I, Y?I,  X?Y=?.

Where X or Y is an associated event, or X and Y compose one associated geo-event. I={i1, i2, ?, im} denotes the attribution aggregate of X and Y, item im denotes one of the attributions of spatiotemporal assignment, which may be the temporal attributions, or the attributions to describe spatial topological relationships, spatial distance relationships, spatial direction relationships, nonspatial attributions or their relative values. X or Y is a subset of I and X or Y is a sub-event of I. For presentation easily, we also call X and Y as geo-event. Once    presentation easily, we also call X and Y as geo-event. Once the attribution aggregate of I gets its value, we call it one realization of an associated geo-event (GE) and use a GEID to identify it. The aggregate of GE will be arranged as a geo- event table. The formula of (1) means geo-event X can infer or result in geo-event Y.

2.3. From geo-event to decision table In order to reduce the rule for geo-event, a decision table should be constructed. According to the definition above, one record in the table includes the attributions of X and that of Y.

It means that one record is an geo-event with its attributions.

2.4.  Discretization for the numeric attribution In general, if attribute is numeric value and its domain of values is large, it will enlarge the search time and make the rule mined too thin to be ignored. So it should be partitioned into different intervals firstly, then it can be mapped each (attribute, interval) pair to a boolean attribute and it will be suitable to the two algorithms above.  For example, the domain of value of A is [l, r]. The domain can be divided into ranges [lk, rk] and (A, value) can be mapped to (A, K).

2.5. Mining algorithm In this presentation, we adopt the algorithm which based on rough set for it can find firstly the most important factor.

In section 2.3, the geo-event has been transformed to the decision table. The decision table describes a subset of the reality world, which includes some geo-events. Let the aggregation of geo-events as U, the condition attributions as C and the decision attributions as D. let C?D =A. That means A denotes the attribution set.  The table can be identified as (U?

C?D, V, f), where V is the aggregation of values of C?D, function f: U?C ? D ? V defines the value of the spatiotemporal assignment.

If B ? A, there is a related duality relationship, i.e.

indiscernibility relation, as following IND (B)={(x, y) ? U: a ? B?a (x)=a (y)}.

That means the attribution set B cannot distinguish some geo-events, such as x and y.   a (x)=a (y) means that the value of attribution a is the same for geo-event x and y.

For example, there is a reality world k={U, {p, q, r}}, where U =={x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7, x8}, IND (p)= ={{x1, Spatiotemporal process Serial of spatial state of event Pre-knowledge Neighborhood Decision table Final rule set Original rule set Spatial discretization Temporal discretization Parameter obtaining Reduced with Rough Set Analysis by knowledge Fig.1.

if R={p, q}, then IND(R)={{x1, x5}, {x2}, {x3}, {x4, x8}, {x6}, {x7}} and [X1]R={x1, x5}. Here x1 and x5 is indiscernibility relation depending on R.

If there is a category X, X? U and X??, R can divide the U as Xi, i=1, 2, ?, n, where Xi ? Xj= ?. Xi  is called as R- basic set. R-basic set can be used to describe the category X as R-lower, R-upper approximation and R-boundary region of X: R_(X)={x ?U|[Xi]R? X} R-- (X)={x ?U|[Xi]R?X??} BND (X)=R--(X)-R_(X) In order to extract the core spatiotemporal assignment which decides the happen of geo-event, we should apply some concepts below.

If a ?A, and IND (A)=IND (A- {a}), then the attribution of a is dispensable in A. Otherwise it is indispensable. If each    a is dispensable in A. Otherwise it is indispensable. If each attribution or their composing is indispensable, we say A is independent. Otherwise A is dependency.

Further more, if B? C, where C is the condition attribution set, we say that D depends on B in a degree k (0?k?1) when k=?B(D)=card (POSB(D)/card (U) Where POSB(D)=U {B_(X)|X ?IND (D)} called a positive region of the partition IND (D) with respect to B, is the set of all geo-events that can be uniquely classified to blocks of the partition IND (D), card (U) is the number of geo-events in the table.

The rough set can be used to search the indispensable attribution in the spatiotemporal assignment. Then the model can continue to find the more item sets, such as 2-item sets, 3- item sets and so on, till the value of k is larger than a certain value.



III. EXPERIMENT In this section we will try to find the rule which could show what kind of pattern of sea surface temperature will make the fish assembling.

3.1Research area and the data The study area (fig.2) lies in Dasha area, the south of the Yellow Sea. This model will be used to study why and when the fishing ground will come into being. Firstly the area is discretized as grid cells (fig.2), cells identified by Ids and corner points identified by T1,T2?T9. When the catch per net is larger than 500 boxes, we look this position as fishing ground or fish assembling.

As figure 2 shows, we set the cell of T6T7TaTb as the focus cell and set the positions of T1, T2?T9.Tg as its neighborhood. We extract the temperature structure of the neighborhood and the fish density at the focus cell as table1, where 8801 denotes the first week in the year of 1988. T1, T2?Tf, Tg denotes the temperature at the position. Tg-T1, Tg- T2, ?, Td-T3, Td-T4 is the relative value of SST between each other. Density is the catch per net in the focus cell. According to the fuzzy pri-knowledge that the fish assembling relates to the grads of temperature in the direction of northwest and in order to show the computing process clear, we only select the Tg-T1 among the relative values of SST.

The SST is derived from NOAA image and the pelagic fish density is calculated by fishing catch data. Let temperature as condition attributes and density as decision attribute.

We name the geo-events as e1, e2, e3, e4, e5, e6, e7, e8, e9, e10. Set C={t1, ? , t7} as condition attributions, density as decision attribution, i.e. D={Density}.

Using the method of rough set to search the rule, the best rule has been mined as following: (ID, 888)?(WEEK, 1)?(T6, b) ?(Ta, b) ??Tg-T1, Y ??(Density, Yes)  100% The result shows the density depends on the {ta?t6?tg- t1} in a degree 100%. That means, for the target cell in the first week, there will be a fishing ground if the temperature of its left-upper position point lies in the range of 13?15?C and that of its left-lower is in the range of 13?15?C and there is a special difference of temperature in the direction of southeast- northwest. The difference of temperature in the direction of southeast-northwest makes the fish concentrate in a relative small area then the density of fish is high.



IV. CONCLUSION The model is based on the discretization of geo-event, which makes it convenient to take the time, location, topologic relation, direction relation, distance relation, and attribution value with the relative value. That means it can reveal the spatiotemporal assignment that makes the geo-event happen.

The calculation of the model is relative simple and can be realized easily. The reduce method of rough set can find the dependency between the condition attributions and the decision attribution.

What the data type of previous association rule model is category. This model can process all data types in scalar, for example, nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio. For the vector field, it may be expressed as two scalar fields. One identifies its value. Another denotes the direction. If so, it can be regarded as two themes in the model.

The model based on grid is suitable for the temporal change frequently and is suitable to process the continue field with the fuzzy boundary, especially in the Oceanography and the Meteorology. And it can use the data directly in the model, which derived from the Remote Sensing with the grid format natively.

The experiment shows that this model can refine the pri- knowledge, which is fuzzy or uncertain.
