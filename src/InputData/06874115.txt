Service Science in top IT Vendors

Abstract?When Service science, management, and engineering (SSME) was introduced in the mid-2000s, top IT vendors, IBM, HP, and Oracle were very aggressive and established research organizations and standardization organizations. But today, it seems that they have changed their course. IBM says it plans to expand Pre-tax Income margins through a shift to higher value material, namely, Software. HP?s CEO, Meg Whitman, said in her interview on February 20, 2014 that ?We are doubling down on Hardware?. Oracle joined in creating an industry consortium called the Service Research and Innovation Initiative (SRII). But we can?t find its name on SRII Management team. As for their sales goods (materials) aspects, all of them are eagerly selling so-called converged infrastructure products, which consist of server, storage, network, and management software, and are featuring UX (user experience) interface to realize self-service system. They put strong emphasis on cloud system, which enable users to construct their systems more easily than before without the help from Services or Solutions Providers. But, these phenomena do not mean that SSME became past relic for IT vendors but mean that IT vendors are trying to develop holistic service systems. Third Platform, which is defined by IT Research consultancies and includes Mobility, Cloud, Social, IoT (Internet of Things) and Big Data as key components, makes it possible to realize its arrival.

In this paper, We overview what is really happening in IT industry and discuss a mechanism about why Third Platform makes it possible to invite a new era through the holistic view of Service Science framework.

The way to discuss the above topic is simple. I used basic Holistic Systems Science approach, i.e., fixed the perspective and methodology at first, then case-studied IT vendors? activities, and at last analyzed them. The curious thing is that personal behavior seems to affect whole system, namely, IT vendor?s activity more intensely than we usually expect and that whole system (environment) affects personal behavior vice versa.

I.  INTRODUCTION IBM gave birth to the term, ?Service Science?, in 2004.

And then IBM Chairman and CEO, Samuel Palmisano, published a report in Innovate America to insist its importance.

Many cooperate and academic researchers and companies themselves got strong interest in it. Top IT vendors, which were competitors with IBM in some way, especially got strong interest and established their research centers for Service Science. IBM itself had established its first IBM Research group completely dedicated to understanding service  innovations from a sociotechnical systems perspective, IBM Almaden Service Research, in 2002. HP has created the Centre for Systems and Service Science in 2005. And Oracle, IBM, HP, and other IT vendors created services consortium, Service Research & Innovation Institute (SRII), in 2007. In its press release in 2009, IBM proclaimed that it was collaborating with hundreds of universities driving curriculum change for a smarter planet and that 250 universities in 50 countries were offering courses or degree programs in Service Science, Management and Engineering (SSME).

But, how is current momentum? Unlike Open Source Software activities, Big Data business, cloud computing platform business and others, IBM did not make B$ level big investments for the promotion of Service Science. I am not able to find the web pages of HP?s Centre for Systems and Service Science now. And no Oracle employees are on the list of Service Science Research & Innovation Institute (SRII) Management team. (At least, Oracle was not a sponsor of SRII Global Conference 2014.) Charlie Bess, HP Fellow, quoted the statement of Paul Maglio, a Professor of Technology Management and Cognitive and Information Science at the University of California, Merced in his blog post about a new California Center for Service Science (CCSS) on August 9, 2013 that ?Although the service sector accounts for about 80 percent of the jobs and GDP in California, there is currently no organized center for education and research on service at UC or in California more broadly. The mission of the new California Center for Service Science is to advance the frontier of service science research and education, and to emerge as an engine of skill, innovation, and job growth for the state and the nation.? From a negative point of view, its statement might reflect poor results of service science research activity.

These superficial observations are an origin of misunderstanding. So, this paper has done a case study for three top IT vendors with a view of holistic system thinking to get deep insight about Service Science, which IBM now calls Service Science, Management, and Engineering (SSME).

This case study is separated to five chapters. After Introduction chapter, research model and method is presented as Methodology chapter. In the next chapter, we analyze the case background and company transition from past to present as Case Study chapter. It is followed by the chapter which presents the results and finding. In the final chapter, we discuss and summarize the findings and give suggestions for future research.



II. METHODOLOGY  A. Research Perspective There is no clear definition of Service, Service Science, and  Service Science, Management, and Engineering (SSME) which is recognized as common consensus. In WIKIPEDIA, the free encyclopedia on the Internet, SSME is explained as an interdisciplinary approach to the study, design, and implementation of services systems -complex systems in which specific arrangements of people and technologies take actions that provide value for others. Considering this explanation, the confusion of definition might be the fate of a group work of many people who have quite different backgrounds.

Anyway, the first thing we should do is to clarify what we need to know and how. And in these kinds of theme like Service Science, it is sometimes useful for us to clarify ourselves as next step. Who am I? Why have we got interested in the difference between past status and present status of Service Science? What kind of standpoint, in other words, mental models, should we have? And based on these recognitions, we can clarify our needs, namely, research subject and research method. Why do we go through such process? Because we get over our subjectivity brought from uncertainty and obscurity in Service Science. Human brain?s function is very simple, i.e., not so highly sophisticated to treat uncertainty and obscurity without good foothold.

Then, in my case, I am a business person with over twenty years? experience for a certain IT vendor, strategist, though a humble one. As such entity, my strong interest is to get the insight for the behavior of human kinds and organizations as their aggregate, from the view of scientific perspective. So I had some feelings about the change of IT vendors? behavior regarding Service Science. From this point of view, I know and try to adopt holistic systems thinking view like Jim Spohrer of IBM Almaden Research Center this time. With these kinds of races, i.e., seasoned lay person, trans-disciplinary approach might be effective though very tough one.

Based on this background and recognition, I use this time the concept of ?Service Chain?, which includes supply chain as a special case, as my mental model, which is being advocated by Deguchi[6] as a method to construct systems as chains of services.

Fig. 1. Example of Sservice Chain (Healthcare)    Someone might like other new framework, e.g., The Abstract-Entity-Interaction-Outcome-Universals (AEIOU). But AEIOU is suitable to treat system as system. But Service Chain model is very effective when extracting the core mechanism from many entities and events. (Of course, all modeling methods for complex systems have constrains because they extract only essence.)  And about the definition of service itself, this paper adopts the definition from Service-Dominant Logic: the fundamental basis of exchange, that is, service is exchanged for service: all firms are service firms; all markets are centered on the exchange of service, and all economies and societies are service based. (Service-Dominant Logic by Steve Vargo (2006)) And we also recognize service as chained object with ?goods? and ?event? and its mechanism.

B. Research Subject The purpose of this paper is set to understand the basic  mechanism and status quo of cooperation behavior composed of humankinds. Then we decide our research subjects, the granularity of service chain element, to corporation and distinguished individuals as its elements. Though we adopt holistic view approach, IT industry is not the research subject as we discussed. We also don?t research each service activities for its granularity.

C. Research Method The purpose of this paper is set to understand the basic  mechanism and status quo of cooperation behavior composed of humankinds. Then we decide our research subjects, the granularity of service chain element, to corporation and distinguished individuals as its elements. Though we adopt holistic view approach, IT industry is not the research subject as we discussed. We also don?t research each service activities for its granularity.

? Annual report ? Presentation of their strategy to analysts ? Press release ? Internet magazine and interview with executives ? Company blog ? IT Consultancy companies? opinion ? Corporate Website   After listing, Zahir[4] adopted the questionnaires to IT venders managers to evaluate cooperate status, but this case study adopts different approach because people?s recognitions do not liked to their behavior directly and it may be difficult to ask their past recognitions to grasp the difference between past and present.



III. CASE STUDY The purpose of this paper is to explore effectiveness of  holistic system thinking approach for analyzing companies, so we choose three companies, IBM, HP, and Oracle to test examine prospective.

A. IBM IBM was the No.2 largest U.S. firm in terms of employees  (435,000 worldwide, 100,000 in the US) by Fortune in 2012.

It has 12 research laboratories and holds the record of most patents generated by a company for 20 years. Six employees got Nobel Prizes.

In its 10-K annual report with SEC filing published in February 2014, IBM explains, ?International Business Machines Corporation was incorporated in the State of New York on June 16, 1911, as the Computing-Tabulating- Recording Co. (C-T-R), a consolidation of the Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating Machine Co. and The International Time Recording Co. of New York. Since that time, IBM has focused on the intersection of business insight and technological innovation.?  Patricia Murphy, Vice President, presented its current strategy to investors in September, 2013. Based on her presentation, titled IBM Business Perspective 2013, IBM has beliefs that ?New Era of Computing (New era solutions, middleware, and infrastructure)?, ?New Buyers, New Markets (CMOs, CHROs, CFOs, City Leaders, Smarter Industries & Cities, and Growth Markets)?, and ?New Ways of Working (Expertise, Innovation, and Client-centric)? will come. Based on those beliefs, it has three strategic policies.

? ?Deliver innovation with industry-leading high-value solutions and expertise that improve client and industry outcomes?  ? ?Help enterprise clients apply innovation and technology to capture value across the organization, including the front office?  ? ?Manage a smarter, social enterprise, with a highly engaged and skilled global workforce and ecosystem of partners, to provide a world-class experience?  It also explains that ?this new era of computing is reshaping the IT landscape and creating new market dynamics? with four key ingredients, Cloud, Social, Mobile, and Internet of Things (IoT) centered on Big Data as market situation, and that ?IBM is addressing the new era of computing with a full suite of systems, software, services and research, combined with deep industry insight?. The pillars of New Era Solutions are Smarter Analytics, Smarter Commerce, Social Business, Smarter Cities, and Watson Solution. ?IBM is continuously trying to change its business mix toward higher- value, more profitable technologies and market opportunities.

It expects about 50 percent of IBM segment profit to come from Software by 2015?.

IBM consists of nine major business units: Global Technology Services, Integrated Supply Chain, IBM Global Business Service, IBM Global Financing, Research Division, Sales and Distribution, Software Group, CHQ-Corporate, and Systems and Technology Group. Watson Group, a new business unit dedicated to the development and commercialization of cloud-delivered cognitive innovations, will soon be added to them.

And especially for Software Group, it was sub-divided into two groups, Middleware and Solutions.

TABLE I.  SEGMENT PRE-TAX INCOME OF IBM ($ IN BILLIONS)  Year 2000 Year2012  Hardware/Financing 3.3 (35%) 3.3 (14%)  Services 3.7 (38%) 9.9 (41%)  Software 2.6 (27%) 10.8 (45%)  Total 9.6 (100%) 22.0 (100%)    About mergers and acquisitions exceeding $1B, we can find eleven companies since 2002.

? PWC (Consulting and Services) ($3.5B)(2002) ? Rational Software Corporation ($2.1B)(2003) ? Ascential Software Corporation ($1.1B)(2005) ? FileNet (Management software) ($1.6B)(2006) ?

? SoftLayer acquisition ($2B) ? Investment to SoftLayer Data Center ($1.2B) ? Investment to Watson business ($1B) ? Donation to OpenStack(OSS) activity ($1B) About reverse investment, it sold x86 server business to  Lenovo for $2.3B in 2013.

IBM issued five press releases for Service Science. All of  the themes are collaboration with universities. It is different from what IBM is doing about Watson business, which does also collaboration with healthcare industry and others, not only with universities.

The top shareholder is Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. with 6.73% (68,121,984) of all IBM stocks. Next is State Street Corporation of 5.81%, and third position is ranked by Vanguard Group, Inc. of 5.48%.

It is interesting to see major direct holders. Samuel Palsamino holds 285,107. Steven Mills, VP of Software group holds 153,913. And Virgina Rometty, present CEO and Chairman of IBM, holds only 17,832 shares.

B. HP HP has more than 300,000 employees. And in its 10-K  annual report published in March 2014, HP explains itself, ?We are a leading global provider of products, technologies, software, solutions and services to individual consumers, small-and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), and large enterprises, including customers in the government, health and education sectors. Our offerings span the following: personal computing and other access devices; imaging and printing- related products and services; enterprise information technology (IT) infrastructure, including enterprise server and    storage technology, networking products and solutions, technology support and maintenance; multi-vendor customer services, including infrastructure technology and business process outsourcing, application development and support services, and consulting and integration services; and IT management software, information management solutions and security intelligence/risk management solutions.?  Mohamad Ali, Chief Strategy Officer (CSO), presented HP?s current strategy to investors in January 2014. He said about market status that ?New Style of IT? is driven by four new elements, namely, Mobility, Cloud, Social, and Big Data and that HP?s customers are seeking comprehensive solutions that bridge from the past to future and integrate across Hardware, Software, and Services platforms. Printers & Personal Systems, Converged Infrastructure, and HP software are main ingredients for HP?s Services. He has a view that in some cases it may good for HP does hardware, software, and services at the same time. Asked about smart phone business at the conference, he made a comment like this. ?So the first thing I want to say is mobility isn't just about the devices.

There's a whole stack of value creating opportunities within mobility services. There's substantial services value. And as a matter of fact, services and software actually dominate the profit pool for mobility. So devices are important as an element, and we participate in that.? He insisted that HP CEO, Meg Whitman, had the same opinion.

HP issued no press releases regarding Service Science. A lot of data related to Service Science is issued from HP lab.

HP has no common expression for Service Science. It sometimes uses ?Science of Service? or ?Services Science?.

HP is periodically issuing Service Science related information through HP Fellow?s blog titled ?The Next Big Thing?.

HP reports financial status with six segments. It is not categorized as hardware, software, and services.

Non-GAAP operational profit  About investment, HP made $1B investment to make software product using OpenStack Open Source Software in May, 2014. Mergers and acquisitions are;  ? Compaq (2002)($25.0B) ? Procter &Gamble IT (2003)($3.0B) ? Mercury Interactive software (2006)($4.5B) ? Opsware software (2007)($1.6B) ? EDS (2008)($13.9B)  ? 3Com (2009)($2.7B) ? 3PAR (2010)($2.4B) ? ArcSight (2010)($1.5B) ? Autonomy (2011)($11.0B)  C. Oracle Oracle says in its web site that ?For more than three and a  half decades, Oracle has been the leader in database software.

And as it has further developed technologies and acquired best-in-class companies over the years, that leadership has expanded to the entire technology stack, from servers and storage, to database and middleware, through applications and into the cloud. It all began when Larry Ellison saw an opportunity other companies missed: a description of a working prototype for a relational database.? It now has more than 122,000 employees and the revenue of 2013 fiscal year was $38.18B.

At the beginning of its 10-K annual report, Oracle explains itself like this. ?We are the world?s largest provider of enterprise software and a leading provider of computer hardware products and services that are engineered to work together in the cloud and in the data center.? And the beginning of second paragraph it says ?We believe that internal growth and continued innovation with respect to our software, hardware and services businesses are the foundation of our long-term strategic plans.? Third is ?Our software, hardware systems and services businesses are further divided into certain operating segments.? It seems that Oracle categorizes its business to three segments.

But its ?service? is quite different as we use because its services business represented 12% of its total revenues in fiscal 2013. Oracle says it is comprised of the remainder of its operating segments and offers consulting services, managed cloud services and education services. It means that ?hardware? and ?software? include some kinds of services because, in software business, maintenance support fee usually equal to license fee.

And Oracle is also a little bit different in its strategy. For the powerful CEO, it usually doesn?t make long perspective strategy and sometimes changes its short time strategy. It might be the reason why it meager and acquire companies more than $5B. Oracle itself says in its annual report that ?We believe that an active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy as it enhances the products and services that we can offer to customers, expands our customer base, provides greater scale to accelerate innovation, grows our revenues and earnings and increases stockholder value.? Oracle?s acquisitions more than $1B since 2002 are like this. (IBM?s biggest acquisition is SoftLayer for $2B.)  ? PeopleSoft ($10.3B)(2005) ? Siebel Systems software ($5.9B)(2006) ? Hyperion Corporation software ($3.3B)(2007) ? BEA Systems software ($8.5B)(2008) ? Sun Microsystems ($7.4B)(2010) ? Art Technology Group software ($1.0B)(2010) ? Endeca software ($1.1B)(2011) ? RightNow Technologies software ($1.5B)(2011)      ? Taleo software ($1.9B)(2012) ? Acme Packet service provider ($2.1B)(2013)  Oracle has issued little information related to Service  Science since 2009. Before that, Oracle was eager to publish Service Science related information through corporate blogs.

D. SRII (Service Research & Innovation Institute) Infoworld and other IT magazines reported the article titled  ?IBM, Oracle, others create services consortium? on March 28, 2007. It said they had joined in creating an industry consortium focused on establishing Service Science as both a key area for investment by companies and governments and as a full-blown academic discipline. The vendors along with two services organizations -the Technology Professional Services Association (TPSA) and the Service & Support Professionals Association (SSPA) -and other IT companies and universities launched the Service Research & Innovation Initiative (SRII) Wednesday.

Based on a brochure issued 2011, ?SRII is being led by IBM, HP, Microsoft, SAP, Oracle, Cisco, Ericsson, EMC, Symantec, Intel, AMD, Wipro, Infosys, TCS and other Mjor IT Companies.? But Oracle sends no employees to SRII as Management, Global Leadership, or Advisory Council board team. Instead, Vint Cerf, VP of Google, is a member of Advisory Council. And about SRII Annual Global Conference 2014, participants were Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Intel, Citrix, Micsoft, IBM, HP, Infosys, TCS, eBay/PayPal, Accenture, and many others.

E. IT consultancy companies? opinion IDC, ITC research and consulting company, issues annual  prediction every year with great effort. As for 2014, Frank Gens, SVP and Chief Analyst, made his remark in the related press release that ?The 3rd Platform's impact was felt throughout the ICT industry in 2013 as a high-profile CEO lost his job, a major IT player went private, numerous vendors endured cash cow stagnation, and billion-dollar bets were placed on 3rd Platform technologies. In 2014, we'll see every major player make big investments to scale up cloud, mobile, and big data capabilities, and fiercely battle for the hearts and minds of the developers who will create the solutions driving the next two decades of IT spending. Outside the IT industry, 3rd Platform technologies will play a leading role in the disruption (or ?Amazoning?) of almost every other industry on the planet.?  IDC predicts as No. 7 of Top 10 predictions that Social technologies will become increasingly integrated into existing enterprise applications over the next 12-18 months and that, in addition to being a strategic component in virtually all customer engagement and marketing strategies, data from social applications will feed the product and service development process. And as No. 10, it predicts that the 3rd Platform will continue to expand beyond smartphones, tablets, and PCs in 2014 to the Internet of Things (IoT) and that new industry partnerships are expected to emerge as traditional IT vendors accelerate their partnerships with global telecom service providers and semiconductor vendors to create  integrated offerings in the consumer electronics and connected device spaces, which lead to reach the 30 billion autonomously connected end points by 2020.?  Fig. 2. The position of  3rd Platform  F. Job recruiting And about job recruiting, there seems little needs for  Service Science specialist. I used Google to Indeed and Glassdoor job recruiting web sites, which are famous in U.S., using search words, e.g., ?Service Science?, ?Service Scientist?.

The result was that I found several jobs requiring Service business experience or Service Science background. They required much more needs for their companies? industry information. Healthcare and Food service industries were its typical case.

G. Corporate Blogs HP Fellow, Charlie Bess, mentioned about a frank  discussion with Industrial Key persons of Service Science in his blog post on February 16, 2012. They agreed that mind sets of education institutes teachers should be changed to bring up Service Science specialists.



IV. THE RESULT AND FINDINGS  A. The chains of Service are expanding from the start point, e.g., software developers to individual people (end users).

Service systems are continuing evelution.

IBM, HP, IDC, and Oracle, are repeatedly referring to end  users who use smart phone or like such devices as end users.

And IBM and HP are investing a lot of money and human resource to open source software (FLOSS) development activities. The corporate structures are also changing to amalgamated business organization. Though I used the expression ?are expanding?, we will soon see the real figure of the existence of Holistic Service chains. And if Sophrer[1] is right, we also see chains are expanding within whole system and accelerating transformation like evolution.

B. IBM, HP, and Oracle, don?t promote Service only. They treat Hardware, Software, and Service holistically like Service-Dominant Logic.

It seems that they have the view similar to Service-  Dominant Logic. Service is the fundamental basis of exchange, that is, service is exchanged for service: all firms are service firms; all markets are centered on the exchange of service, and all economics and societies are service based, as I quoted in Methodology chapter. IT vendors? M&A activities may substantiate the view. Companies don?t invest where they don?t need.

And it is quite natural for me. Regarding my company, the division I belong to made ?Service business development department? last year. With this knowledge and other IT vendors? movement, Service is a kind of air for me.

C. We might need some kinds of mechanism if we want to develop Service Science.

?Individual? and ?motivation (background)? seem to affect  corporate activities. I didn?t mention in the case study chapter, but former IBM CEO, Samuel Palmisano, was once the top of IBM Global Services. He started his career as sales person of IBM. And HP CEO, Meg Whitman, was once CEO of eBay and had experience to work at Disney. Both of them know services very well, and they are good at understanding end users.

But IT vendors are IT vendors, not for the entity for promoting Service Science but for the entity which is superior to developing hardware and software. We might be able to say system environment chose them.

But SRII, once established by top IT vendors, now have new members from Facebook, Amazon, Google, Apple, and so on. Of course, it is good for SRII to get new comers. But it seems that many of them have a feature to have function to affect end users directly. Can we expect the natural evolution of value co-creation in these kinds of entities (Service systems)?

Fig. 3. End Users centered in System    D. Companies need Scientists not only for services but for many disciplines.

As a seasoned business person, I agree with people who  regard Service Science critically important and welcome new employees who studied Service Science.

But, I also need other expertise, e.g., software programming or electronic engineering because we sell hardware and software, not only Service. Usually, they are more important than service expertise in many cases. Based on the case study observation, education is present hot topic. The participation of Tokyo University, top ranked institute in Japan, to SRII annual conference in 2014 was good news. I also agree with its importance and know the idea of T shaped skill set. But isn?t it good for us also to consider employment mechanism?



V. DISCUSSIONS AND SUMMARY This case study is a first approach to understanding IT  vendors from the view of Service science. As such one, it was very useful to have introduced the view of ?Holistic Service Chain? concept. I think it may help us to carry on our research to IT industry or whole world.

But one concern is structural difference between existing IT vendors and new comers like Amazon, Google, Facebook, and so on. Because, if we see the business model of Facebook through Selectorate theory invented in political science, it seems they try to collect tax from citizen (end users) more efficiently, rather than creating new value co-creation. If it is true and a nature of their business models, we need to research the way to modify this mechanism if we want to benefit customers. So, what kinds of mind set should we have to research Service science system itself? I have no intention that existing IT vendors? one is good, though its member.
