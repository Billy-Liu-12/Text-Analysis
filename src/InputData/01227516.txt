RQ in a fuzzy context. We transform the initial implication into a fuzzy implication and the matching process is modeled by the extension .of the fuzzy ~Galois connection while considering a fuzzy quantifier. We want to implement a retrieval engine only based on the-computation of this fuzzy Galois connection. Another research area we want-to explore is a combination of the direct and reverse implication, as suggested by the initial general logic framework proposed by Nie.

As work-in progress, we propose to use the proposed extension of the fuzzy Galois connection in textmining to extract fuzzy'association rules between terms and perform query expansion using these fuzzy associations between terms.
