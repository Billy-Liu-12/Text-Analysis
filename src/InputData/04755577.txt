PCCR Study for Italy: Meat Consumption, Preparation , and Meat-derived  Carcinogens on the Risk of Sporadic Pancreatic Cancer

Abstract  The objective of our hospital-based study was to identify dietary meat and preparation type factors as well as meat-derived mutagens that are associated with risk of pancreatic cancer (PC). Data collected on 99 case-control pairs matched by age, gender and region, enrolled in the international Pancreatic Cancer Collaborative Registry (PCCR), were analyzed. Conditional logistic regression produced adjusted (AOR) and unadjusted (UOR) odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for tertiles determined from the control subjects, as well as P values for trend (Ptrend) using the medians for the tertiles. PC was associated with dietary intake of processed meat (Ptrend = 0.0495) in a non-linear fashion as well as increased intake of the mutagen MeIQX (Ptrend = 0.0444, AOR = 2.327) and, to a lesser extent, with frying (Ptrend = 0.1337) in a non-linear fashion, and the increased dietary intake of the mutagen BaP (Ptrend = 0.0687, AOR = 2.212).

1. Introduction   Genetic  Pancreatic cancer is relatively rare causing only an estimated 2% of all cancer cases in the world in year 2000, with 90-95% of these cases being sporadic [1]. However, it is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths for men and women in the USA, with 5-year survival rate that is less than 5% [2-3].

Some 37,170 new pancreatic cancer cases and 33,370 pancreatic cancer related deaths were estimated to occur in the United States in 2007 [3]. About 80% of patients have metastatic disease by the time of the first clinical visit. Only 10% of the patients have been found to be operable at time of diagnosis, and even in these patients the postoperative five-year survival rate has remained below 20% [4, 5]. Many patients die within the first three months after surgery because of the extremely high rate of recurrence.

Few factors associated with the age of onset of pancreatic cancer have been well established so far because it is a rare disease and the data sets available  for analysis are often too small (particularly, in terms of the number of  pancreatic cancer cases). There are some suggested factors that may increase the risk of pancreatic cancer development. These factors include age, race, gender, genetics, and lifestyle habits (such as physical activity, smoking, alcohol drinking, and diet).

Similar to all other forms of cancers, about 75% of pancreatic cancer occurs in people at age 65 or older.

Thus, age is the strongest, yet nonmodifiable, risk factor known for this malignancy [6].  The second most important and best established (and modifiable) factor for pancreatic cancer after age, is cigarette smoking [7, 8]. Smokers have a significantly increased risk of pancreatic cancer, making smoking the most consistently observed environmental risk factor.

Nearly every study has shown approximately a two- fold increased risk for sporadic pancreatic cancer in smokers compared to nonsmokers [6, 9-14]. There is a 50% increased risk of pancreatic cancer in African- Americans compared with Caucasians, and a 30% excess risk in males compared to females [6].  Familial history of pancreatic cancer as well as high sugar intake and diagnosis of diabetes mellitus have also been associated with the disease [8, 15]. Diabetes and pancreatic cancer are undoubtedly associated, although the temporal relationship and possible causation has remained difficult to establish [16, 17].

Dietary factors may contribute to 30-50% of pancreatic cancer cases, although due to limited and inconsistent study findings the specific role remains unclear [9, 18]. Meat, eggs, and dairy products have been associated with elevated pancreatic cancer risk in some studies but not in others [19-22]. Different types of animal fat as well as meat and meat preparation methods [7, 8, 23-27] have also been studied as possible contributors to pancreatic cancer. However, the existing direct epidemiological and other evidence for such contribution is insufficient and consensus on this issue does not exist among specialists. On the other hand, meat cooked at high temperatures is a source of heterocyclic amines (HCA) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) [28] which have been shown to be mutagenic in Ames Salmonella Tests and      often in animals [29, 30]. Other epidemiological data suggests that nitrosamines in preserved food cause stomach cancer [31]. The role in the etiology of pancreatic cancer of dietary exposure to mutagenic factors found in cooked meat (nitrosamines, HCA, and PAH) has been elucidated in a recent population-based case-control study [32] and a hospital-based case- control study [33]. It was found, in particular, that a higher intake of dietary mutagens (those in the two top quintiles) was associated with an average 2-fold (between 1.5 and 2.4) increased risk of sporadic pancreatic cancer.

Identification of modifiable environmental and lifestyle factors could lead to health policies that delay disease onset whereas identification of nonmodifiable factors would be useful when counseling at risk individuals that could be enrolled in therapeutic and preventive interventions. The objective of this international multi-center hospital-based study was to identify dietary meat factors, as well as meat preparation methods and mutagenic factors found in cooked meat (nitrosamines, heterocyclic amines ? HCAs, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ? PAHs) associated with the carcinogenesis and risk for pancreatic cancer. We calculated the meat-derived daily intake of three HCAs (MeIQx, DiMeIQx, and PhIP), one polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) BaP, and a mutagenic index (revertants per gram of daily meat intake) estimated by a previously validated meat preparation questionnaire and a mutagen database (http://charred.cancer.gov/hpfs.html). Data from the Pancreatic Cancer Collaborative Registry (PCCR) were analyzed.

2. Patients and Methods  2.1. Study design   The Pancreatic Cancer Collaborative Registry (PCCR) is a web-based, multi-center, international pancreatic cancer registry that was established in 2003 to collect disease-related information in a standardized and efficient way [34]. It offers extensive computer- based quality control procedures and user-friendly web-based questionnaires. The overall goal of the PCCR consortium has been to create a collaborative infrastructure that would allow researchers from multiple centers around the world to collect a variety of critical information and biospecimens data on pancreatic cancer patients and high-risk subjects, as well as to mine the collected data and perform sophisticated data analysis. At present, eight cancer centers (seven in the USA and one in Italy) utilize this system. As of May 22, 2008, the PCCR contained data  on 1,530 subjects with sporadic and familial pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The data collection is accomplished through a complex survey that is completed either on- line or via a multi-page form, and requires approximately one hour to complete. Data collected in the PCCR have been used as a platform for several research projects on familial pancreatic cancer [35-37], which should lead to a better understanding of the etiology and treatment of pancreatic cancer.

The matter of details on standardization and categorization of the collected data has been carefully worked out and rigorously implemented from the inception of the PCCR. For this purpose, four committees (Pathology / Specimen, Epidemiology / Instrument, Imaging Collection, and IRB) were organized from a group of twenty-one experts. A core data set for the PCCR has been agreed upon by these groups. It is generated from questionnaires that have already been utilized in the participating institutions, as well as from established forms for the socio- demographic, environmental, clinical and family history data of individuals and family members with a history of pancreatic cancer. Existing standards, such as Health Level 7 (HL7), International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9), Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED), and Common Data Elements (CDE), were utilized during the development of the forms.

A list of required data elements for clinical, epidemiological, nutritional, pharmaceutical, and quality of life (QoL) studies is presented below:  Date of birth Date of study Age at diagnosis/age at study Birth country Gender Marital status Race/ethnicity Current height & weight Usual weight at age 20, 50, prior to illness Education ? highest level completed Tobacco/smoking habits Alcohol consumption (current & past) Confirmed index case (Y/N) Imaging studies done Stage (pathologic & clinical) at diagnosis Surgical intervention (Y/N) Medications Other Diseases & date of diagnoses Previous surgery Previous involvement in other cancer research Radiation exposure Summary of family history      Optional data elements cover a variety of questions divided into Personal, Demographic, Lifestyle, Physical Activity, Dietary Habits, Family History, QoL, Medical History, Treatment, Surgery, Biospecimen, and Follow-up questionnaires.

Experts suggested that: (i): Personal, Demographic, Lifestyle, Physical Activity, Dietary Habits, Family History, Quality of Life, information may be provided by the subject; (ii) information on Medical, Treatment, Surgery, Biospecimens, and Follow-up must be provided by clinician/institution involved in the subject?s care; and (iii) the core data set should also include the following administrative data elements: Date when the case was submitted; Current status of the case; Registering institution code; Person completing the case (Name, telephone, email); Subject identification code.

PCCR Architecture. The PCCR system has been implemented using a three-tier, Web-based architecture: (i) a client that interacts with the user; (ii) an application server that contains the business logic of the application; and (iii) a resource manager that stores the data. The components of this system are written using Java, SQL, and JavaScript programming languages. PC-related data is stored in a relational database (Oracle 10g).

PCCR Web Interface.  The PCCR website can be accessed at http://pccrproject.org. The PCCR user interface is designed to eliminate ambiguity in the data collected and assist users with accuracy and ease of completion. Most of time, users are given the lists of standard options to choose from, instead of text fields.

The validation components prevent the users from entering erroneous information into the system. The quality of the PCCR user interface has been one of the major focuses during the project development.

PCCR Security. The security of the patient?s personal information collected in the PCCR has been addressed using recommendations of the Computer-based Patient Record Institute (CPRI) and the electronic information security standards mandated by the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).

According to the CPRI, a complete security solution that maximizes the benefits of networked data communications must contain the following elements: User Authentication, Access Control, Encryption, Physical Protection, and Management. User authentication, access control, and data encryption issues have addressed during the application?s initial development, while physical protection and network management have been provided by the production environment.

2.2. Study population   One thousand one hundred and ten (1,110) sporadic cases diagnosed with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (exocrine) were enrolled in the Pancreatic Cancer Collaborative Registry (PCCR) as of May 22, 2008. Of these cases and the healthy controls enrolled in the PCCR at the Italian collaborating center (University of Genoa), we selected for the study 99 case-control pairs matched by age (within 5 years), gender and region who satisfied the inclusion- exclusion study criteria. All cases were individuals with newly diagnosed and pathologically confirmed primary pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (International Classification of Diseases for Oncology code C25.3, WHO, 2000). The controls were noncancer individuals admitted to the hospital for diseases other than cancer and unrelated to digestive tract disease or to known risk factors for pancreatic cancer. The main diagnostic categories for hospital admission are acute surgical and musculoskeletal diseases. Men and women diagnosed with pancreatic cancer at age 35-85 years since 1980 were included in the study as cases. Included were patient cases and control subjects who completed the meat questionnaire, while excluding those with missing or erroneous information. The Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) of all institutions participating in the PCCR had approved this study protocol.

2.3. Dietary assessment   The questionnaires implemented in the PCCR are well established in the cancer research community, such as the NCI Quick Food Scan Percent Fat Screener questionnaire [38, 39]. To create the physical activity page, the American Cancer Society?s (ACS) examples of moderate versus vigorous physical activity guidelines for cancer prevention were used [40].

Whenever possible, in-person interviews were conducted with the subjects to obtain information including basic demographic information, cigarette smoking history, dietary intake, physical activity, and medical and family history, among others. The NCI Quick Food Scan Percent Fat Screener questionnaire [39] was the basis for the assessment of the percent of energy from fat intake.  A self-administered meat- cooking practices module (FFQ), developed at the NCI, was completed to assess the consumption of 14 meat/preparation items using a matrix format that asked about participants? weekly consumption before beginning to feel sick. Each of 4 types of meat (beef, pork, poultry, and fish) were crossed with each of 3 types of preparation (BBQ/grilled, fried, and baked) to form 12 meat/preparation combinations, whereas 2      more combinations (cold cuts, smoked meats) involving any type of meat were separately surveyed, bringing the total of meat/preparation combinations to 14. The questionnaire collected information on how many servings (0, 1-2, 3-4, 5-6) of the 14 meat/preparation combinations were consumed per week. The intake of mutagens and carcinogens from cooked meat were assessed by the Computerized Heterocyclic Amines Resource for Research in Epidemiology of Disease (CHARRED) database system, using the average values for doneness since information on doneness was not collected.

CHARRED has been developed at the NCI (http://charred.cancer.gov/hpfs.html) and comprises a detailed meat cooking module within a food frequency questionnaire (from some 120 categories of meat) in conjunction with a mutagen database. Thus estimates on mutagenic activity (which is a measure of total mutagenic potential that summarizes all meat-related mutagens), heterocyclic amines (HCAs: MeIQx, DiMeIQx, and PhIP), and a and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH: benzo(a)pyrene (BaP)), were obtained using average portion size and the frequency data from the dietary meat and preparation frequency questionnaire.

2.4. Statistical analysis   The data were summarized and reported using means and standard deviations for continuous variables or, as appropriate for categorical variables, proportions or odds ratios (OR), with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). When cases were compared with controls for the demographic and risk factor tables, the two- group non-parametric Wilcoxon test for continuous variables and, respectively, the Pearson Chi-square test for categorical variables were used. Correlations between variables were reported using the non- parametric Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient. Dietary meat and preparation type variables (measured in servings per week) as well as mutagens were modeled as continuous variables (as the log of the number of servings) when a model was examined for the presence of interactions, and also as categorical variables by comparing the lowest tertile to the second and third tertiles. The tertiles were determined from the distribution among the control subjects.  On those occasions when test for trend was performed, the medians for the respective tertiles of dietary pattern were used in the analysis as exposure scores [41]. The reported unadjusted Odds Ratios (UOR) are for the effect on pancreatic cancer risk of the respective risk factor (meat or preparation type or mutagen) when analyzed alone in a conditional logistic regression model. All adjusted Odds Ratios (AOR) are  from the expanded conditional logistic regression model when the effect of the respective risk factor has been adjusted for the following known and suspected, mostly nondietary, risk factors for pancreatic cancer: age, sex, height, usual weight, smoking, education, percent of energy intake from dietary fat, and a history of diabetes for >2 years prior to the date of cancer diagnosis in PC cases or data collection (a.k.a. pseudo- diagnosis) in control subjects. All covariates were chosen based on previous research implicating them as putative risk factors for pancreatic cancer (with only age and smoking firmly confirmed, as mentioned in the introduction section). There were at least 10 case- control pairs (i.e. outcome events) per predictor variable (EPV) thus satisfying the rule of thumb requirement for logistic regression models [42]. Since we have not collected data on total energy intake, we indirectly adjusted for it using height, usual weight, and BMI, as suggested in [43]. We further fitted models for AOR with and, respectively, without height, usual weight, and BMI, but here we have presented only the results from models adjusting only for energy from dietary fat (which was statistically significant) and not for height, usual weight, and BMI, since the two models led to the same results and fewer individuals were excluded due to missing values.

When first-order interaction terms were tested in a model (e.g. between meat consumption variables or total meat and demographic factors), they were selected by a backwards selection procedure with 0.10 significance level for staying in the model. The statistical package SAS 9.1 (SAS Inst, Inc, Cary, NC) was used in all analyses, and all reported P values are two-sided. When reporting statistical significance we have always referred to level of significance 0.05.

3. Results  3.1. Demographics   This study sample included 99 pancreatic cancer cases and 99 noncancer controls pair-matched by age (within 5 years), gender and region who satisfied the inclusion-exclusion study criteria and were available from the PCCR registry as of May 22, 2008. Patients? records were collected by the medical center in Italy (University of Genoa) where the matching had been performed initially. The vast majority of cases and controls were Caucasian (over 99% in both groups), with slightly higher number of males among the matched pairs, 50 (50.5%). The average age at diagnosis for the cases was 65.8 years, which was lower than the average age of 69.9 years at data collection (a.k.a. pseudo-diagnosis) for the controls      (with P = 0.0068). The mean percent of total energy intake from dietary fat was higher for the cases compared to the controls (resp. 30.9% versus 29.1%, with P = 0.0004). Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus was higher among the cases compared to the controls (resp.

14.1% versus 4%, with P = 0.0137). There was also difference in smoking status between the cases (34.3%) and the controls (16.2%), with P = 0.0033. However, mean BMI was similar for the cases compared to the controls (resp. 26.4 kg/m2 versus 24.4 kg/m2, with P = 0.1247), and so was the percent of individuals with at least some college education (resp. 17.2% versus 9.1%, with P = 0.0931). The demographic characteristics of the study participants are presented in Table 1.

3.2. Diet   For the purposes of reporting and analysis of meat type, we combined beef and pork into one category, ?red meat?, as is customary. The results are presented in Table 2.

Total average meat consumption for our Italian subjects whose data were analyzed in this study was significantly less compared to responders at the US centers (15.55 weekly servings). These results were comparable with reported per capita average weekly meat consumption in Italy and the USA in 2002, the last year for which data were available (http://earthtrends.wri.org) of 1.74 kg and 2.40 kg, respectively. Indeed, assuming average serving size of 150 g, the latter quantities translate to 11.6 for Italy and, respectively, 16.0 weekly servings for the USA. Grilling was the preferred preparation method for both cases and controls, with 5.79 and 5.34 weekly servings, respectively. Also for grilling, red meat was on average the predominant choice among both cases and controls. Whereas the type of meat was concerned, the controls consumed similar number of servings of poultry and fish as the cases, (6.33 versus 6.29) but the cases consumed more servings of red meat than the controls (4.95 versus 4.48). The difference in consumption of grilled red meat was statistically significant (P = 0.0199), as was the difference (P = 0.0386) for the consumption of grilled fish, although the directions of these two differences were opposite. Cases and controls consumed on average similar amounts of servings of baked meat, poultry and fish, as well as processed meat.

Consumption of processed meat was also similar in cases and controls. For the purpose of the analysis, we followed the matrix format of the dietary meat questionnaire and grouped the response variables into two groups for the weekly consumption frequencies: (i) meat preparation method (grilling, frying, baking, meat processing) and (ii) meat type (red meat, poultry, and fish). Since each of the original variables (i.e. fried poultry, baked red meat, etc.) contributed to each of these two groups, the pairwise correlations between meat preparation method variables and meat type variables were quite high. In particular, the highest values of the Spearman correlation coefficient were between red meat and frying (rrf = 0.59), red meat and baking (rrb = 0.53), and grilling and poultry (rgp = 0.47). The correlations among meat types were moderate (Spearman correlation coefficients ranging from 0.17 to 0.23). On average, the smallest were the correlations among meat preparation methods, ranging from ?0.13 (between frying and grilling) to 0.23 (between frying and baking). These results indicate much stronger selectivity among the responders for the meat preparation method than for the meat type. All mentioned correlation coefficients were statistically significant (P < 0.01).

We also examined the differences between cases and controls with respect to mutagens intake, as determined by the CHARRED system. The intake of      all mutagens (MeIQx, DiMeIQx, PhIP, and BaP) as well as mutagenicity was consistently higher for the cases, but was statistically significant (P = 0.0109) only for MeIQx, and marginally significant (P = 0.0779) for BaP (Benzo(a)pyrene). The results are presented in Table 3.

The effect of total meat consumption in both the unadjusted and adjusted model was not statistically significant.  The results are presented in Table 4.

Next, we investigated the main effects of intake  (servings per week) of type of meat (red meat, poultry, fish, and processed meat) and type of preparation (frying, grilling, baking, and processed) on the risk of pancreatic cancer. The results are presented in Table 5.

As indicated in Table 5, processed meat (adjusted  Ptrend = 0.0495) and frying (adjusted Ptrend = 0.1337) were more strongly associated with pancreatic cancer than the other meat and preparation types. Particularly, increased frying was marginally significantly associated with increasing of pancreatic cancer risk, while processed meat (cold cuts and/or smoked meats) consumption showed first increasing and then decreasing statistically significant (non-linear) trend.

For the preparation methods grilling and baking, as well as for the meat categories red meat, poultry and fish, both the unadjusted and adjusted Ptrend exceeded 0.35, and were not associated with pancreatic cancer risk.

The last analyses focused on the mutagens and their  plausible effect on risk for pancreatic cancer. The results are presented in Table 6.

Of all mutagens, including the mutagenicity index,  only MeIQX was significantly associated with the risk of pancreatic cancer. Tertile analysis showed that increasing intake of MeIQx across tertiles was significantly associated with increased risk of pancreatic cancer (Ptrend = 0.0444), with AOR = 2.33 for the highest tertile group compared with the lowest tertile group. Similarly, BaP across tertiles was marginally significantly associated with increased risk of pancreatic cancer (Ptrend = 0.0687), with AOR = 2.21 for the highest tertile group compared with the lowest tertile group.

4. Discussion   In this hospital-based matched-pairs case-control study, pancreatic cancer was positively associated with dietary intake of processed meat (in a non-linear fashion) as well as increased intake of the mutagen MeIQX and, to a lesser extent, with frying and the increased dietary intake of the mutagen BaP. The associations were robust to multivariate adjustment.

Neither total meat nor the mutagenicity index (which reflects the total meat consumption to a great extent in our study) showed significant effect on the risk for pancreatic cancer.

In our discussion below we have focused on three recent cohort studies [20, 25, 26] of pancreatic cancer that have dealt with meat consumption and/or methods of preparation, and one very recent hospital-based case-control study [33] that has investigated the association of mutagens and pancreatic cancer. Our study differed from the three cohort studies in its design (matched-pairs case-control versus cohort), in its method of statistical data analysis (logistic  regression versus the Cox model), and in the number of the pancreatic cancer cases ascertained. As long as the case-control study is concerned, ours differed from it in the matching, the number of study participants and the level of detail in the questionnaires used. However, some of our conclusions were similar to those arrived at by these four studies.

Michaud et al. [20] have conducted a cohort study ascertaining 178 pancreatic cancer cases, and have found that intakes of total meat and red meat were not related to risk. This is similar to what we have found.

In [20], individual food items contributing to intakes of total meat or fish had not revealed any specific association. However, the influence of cooking practices, intake of meat mutagens, as well as other dietary habits on the risk of pancreatic cancer was not examined in [20], and comparison could not be made.

Larsson et al. [26] have used the Cox proportional hazards model in a prospective study of 172 incident pancreatic cancer cases, and found that long-term red meat consumption was positively associated with risk of pancreatic cancer (Ptrend = 0.01), long-term poultry consumption was inversely associated with the risk (Ptrend = 0.04), whereas fish consumption was not associated with pancreatic cancer risk. Our study differed from [26] in its design (matched-pairs case- control versus cohort), in its method of statistical data analysis (conditional logistic regression versus the Cox model), and in the number and the sex of the pancreatic cancer cases ascertained (289 men and women versus 172 women). However, we also found that fish consumption had no effect on pancreatic. The adjusted Ptrend = 0.07 for red meat consumption was found in [26] when data from their earlier (1987?1990) consumption questionnaires were used and adjusting for virtually the same covariates (a.k.a. Model 2 in [26]) we had in our model. Another difference between our study and that in [26] was that processed meat was associated with risk for pancreatic cancer in our study.

However, [26] did not investigate the methods of meat preparation or the effect of mutagens/carcinogens, and no comparison with our study can be drawn with respect to those.

N?thlings et al. [25] have also used the Cox proportional hazards model in a prospective study of 482 incident pancreatic cancer cases, and found that red and processed meat intakes were associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer. The strongest association in [25] has been found with processed meat (Ptrend < 0.01), although intakes of pork and of total red meat have also been associated with increases in risk (both Ptrend < 0.01). No association of pancreatic cancer risk has been found with intake of poultry and fish, similar to our study. In [25], intake of total fat from meat was associated with statistically significant      increases in pancreatic cancer, whereas in our study we measured only percent energy from fat which turned out to be a very significant risk factor. However, [25] did not investigate the methods of meat preparation or the effect of mutagens/carcinogens, and no comparison with our study can be drawn with respect to those.

Li et al. [33] have conducted a hospital-based case- control study on the association of meat-derived mutagens and risk for pancreatic cancer involving 626 cases and 530 noncancer controls. They have found that the cases had a higher daily intake of food mutagens and mutagenicity activity (revertants per gram of daily meat intake) than controls did, similar to what we found. In [33], the daily intakes of DiMeIQx and benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), as well as the mutagenic activity, were significant predictors for pancreatic cancer, with adjustment of other confounders. In quintile analysis, they have also observed a significant trend of elevated cancer risk with increasing DiMeIQx intake (Ptrend = 0.024), which was different from our own result when adjusted Ptrend = 0.239. Particularly, in [33] they have found that a higher intake of dietary mutagens (those in the highest two quintiles) had been associated with a 2-fold increased risk for sporadic pancreatic cancer, similar to our finding of AOR = 2.33 for MeIQx. Interestingly, Li et al. [33] found a possible synergistic effect of dietary mutagen exposure and smoking that was observed among individuals with the highest level of exposure (top 10%) to PhIP and BaP.

Our study has its weaknesses and room for future improvement. For example, because PCCR is still gathering strength and numbers, in future studies we should be able to recruit a larger number of suitable controls for case-control matching (e.g. within centers for age and sex), which will likely increase the statistical power. An improved (i.e. more detailed) meat and preparation methods questionnaire with portion size and donennes would also likely increase the statistical power and make possible to obtain more precise estimates of the effects of the studied risk factors. It should be noted that completion of the current questionnaires requires about an hour already, and extending them would likely make it more difficult for the study participants (particularly the pancreatic cancer cases) to complete them.
