Measuring System Complexity to

Abstract- Systems and System-of-Systems (SoS) are being used more frequently either as a design element of stand alone  systems or architectural frameworks. Consequently, a  programmatic need has arisen to understand and measure  systems complexity in order to estimate more accurately  development plans and life-cycle costs. In a prior paper, we  introduced the System Readiness Level (SRL) concept as a  composite function of both Technology Readiness Levels  (TRLs) and Integration Readiness Levels (IRLs) and touched  on system complexity. While the SRL approach provides a  repeatable, process-driven method to assess the maturity of a  system or SoS, it does not capture all aspects of system  complexity.

In this paper we assess the concept of cyclomatic complexity as  a system complexity metric and consider its utility as an  approach for estimating the life-cycle costs and cost growth of  complex systems. We hypothesize that the greater the number  of technologies and integration tasks, the more complex the  system and the higher its cost to develop and maintain. We  base our analysis on historical data from DoD programs that  have experienced significant cost growth, including some that  have been cancelled due to unsustainable cost (and schedule)  growth.

We begin by describing the original implementation of the  cyclomatic method, which was developed to estimate the effort  to maintain system software. We then describe how the  method can be generalized and applied to systems. Next, we  show how to estimate the cyclomatic number (CN) and show  the statistical significance between a system's CN metric and  its cost. We illustrate the method with an example. Last, we  discuss opportunities for future research.
