I. INTRODUCTION Systematic coal mine hidden danger management applies  more and more widely as coal mine hidden danger is one of the important factors that lead to accidents. In the process of hidden danger continuous inputting, it produced a large number of hidden danger data. However, the problem of ?data rich, but information poor? still persists. Hidden danger information of the accidents can reveal the inevitability of the accident and hidden information within the association to a certain extent. In order to extract useful information on the safety management from the massive hidden danger data, this paper uses an improved Apriori algorithm for association rule mining of coal mine hidden danger data. The introduction of Apriori algorithm which belongs to association rules algorithm is to analysis the hidden danger data by mining potential data information to explore the occurrence regular pattern inside the hidden danger information. Then provide a scientific basis for avoiding accidents.



II. CONCEPT DESCRIPTION OF ASSOCIATION RULE Mining Association Rule is finding interesting, frequent  pattern, association and correlation from the transaction database, relational database and other information which is stored in a large number of data items set. It focuses on the relationship between the different attributes of the given data set to find the potential relationship rules that meet the conditions by setting the support and confidence threshold.

This review focuses on the association rule mining in the  safety hidden danger of coal mine workplaces data analysis application and provides a basis for decision making on the prediction of the accident.

Assuming transaction database mining for association  rules, 1 2, , , , ,k nD t t t t , any element  1 2, , , , , 1, 2, ,k j pt i i i i k n corresponds to a transaction, each transaction has a unique identifier TID, element ji 1, 2, ,j p in kt is called a project. Suppose  1 2, , , nI i i i is a collection of all the items. Any subset  X of the set I is called the set of items in the set D .

If X k , then call the set k-set. Association rule is an implication of expression of X Y ,where X I , Y I and X Y .the rules X Y established in the transaction setD .

Support of X Y represents a percentage of the  transaction D included X Y , denoted bysup port X Y .

sup support X Y port X Y P X Y Confidence of X Y means the percentage of  transaction D contains both X and Y , denoted byconfidence X Y .

sup 100%  sup port X Y  confidence X Y P Y X port X  If sup min_ support X Y and  min_confidence X Y conf , then call the association rules as the strong association rules. Strength of association rules can use the support and confidence to measure. In general, only the association rule that both the support and confidence are high is of interest to the user and contains valuable association rules. Thus, the association rules mining becomes finding all strong association rules that meet the given the support and confidence. It can be subdivided into two sub-problems: 1) find all frequent item sets in D that meet the  condition sup min_ support X .

Obviously, the second step is simply by definition to find rules that meet the minimum support and minimum confidence. So this step is relatively easy. Thus, the focus of the study is that the first step in how to find out all frequent item sets. Apriori algorithm is used to solve this problem.



III. APRIORI ALGORITHM AND ITS IMPROVEMENT  A. Apriori Algorithm and its Problem Apriori is a classic algorithm of mining frequent item set  which generates Boolean association rules. The basic principle is to use the iterative method for layer-by-layer search. It mines valuable association rules from static data information, the general idea is as follows: Scan the database for the first time, make a count on all supports of single project, and projects more than a given minimum support compose frequent item set L1. Then scan the database repeatedly, obtain the final frequent item set through recursion.

It can be simplified to the following three steps: 1) Connect step: connect (k-1) frequent item set to  form k-item candidate set.

Connect condition: The first (k-2) items in the two (k-1)  item sets are equal, and the (k-1) item in the first item set is smaller than that in the second set.

2) Delete step: Prune the k-candidate set based on  important nature of Apriori algorithm.

Pruning rules: If any (k-1) item sub-set in the k-item  candidate set do not belong to (k-1) item frequent set L, k- item set of this candidate set can be deleted.

3) Counting step: Scan the transaction database,  accumulate the number of occurrences that k-item candidate set appears in the database.

Counting method: If transaction log contains the candidate set, the number of occurrences of the candidate set plus l. Then generate k-frequent set according to a given minimum support threshold.

Data flow diagram is as follows:  Figure1. Data flow diagram of Apriori Algorithm  Apriori algorithm goes on layer-by-layer iterative research based on frequent item sets. The process is relatively simple, and easy to implement. But it still has some difficult deficiencies to overcome.

(1) Scan the database for too many times, and the process  occupies most of the time the program runs.

(2) Iterate repeatedly, scan again and again to determine  whether the first (k-2) items in the two (k-1) item sets are equal and whether the last items are different. It causes the performance of the algorithm lower.

(3) It generates a large number of candidate frequent  item sets in the iterative process, and it does much pattern matching. Thus it spends a lot of time on the O/I, and the process is inefficient.

B. Apriori Algorithm Improvements For those deficiencies of Apriori algorithm, the paper  researches for a corresponding improvement and proposes the improved algorithm of Apriori. It takes advantage of an important nature of Apriori algorithm in the optimization of the connection policy: all non-empty subset of any frequent item set are also frequent item sets. By use of this nature, it conducts a screening before each time the candidate set are obtained by connection step, and it also can greatly reduce     the number of scanned item sets, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the algorithm. For optimization of the database, the method is to use the Boolean matrix to record each transaction in the database information, so that it can achieve a one-time scan of the database.

(1) Improvement of connection For (k-1)-frequent sets La and Lb, if La and Lb cannot  connect, all (k-1) frequent item sets behind La and Lb can also not satisfy the connection. The process is determined because each transaction item in the database is arranged by order, thus can greatly reduce frequency of analyzing and save a lot of time. The improved algorithm is described as follows:  for each La?Lk-1 {for each Lb?Lk-1 {if(La[1]=Lb[1]?Lb[2]?La[k-2]=Lb[k-2]?La[k-  1]<Lb[k-1]) {C=La?Lb;// two item sets connect together Ck=Ck?{C};}  else break;// the itemsets behind Lb cannot connect with La  } }  Then prune the frequent set, this step applies an important nature of Apriori: a necessary condition which k- dimensional data item set is a frequent item set is its all k-1 dimensional subsets are frequent item sets. The connections of frequent (k-1) item set draw candidate k-item sets, and by calculating the intersection of affairs of (k-1)-frequent item sets in the support k-item sets ( provided La?Lk-1?Lb?Lk-1, then La?Lb?Ck, and calculate TLa?TLb=TLa?TLb), it derives the transaction set that supports the each k-item set.

And delete item sets that support transaction number is less than the minimum number of support transactions, finally draw frequent k-item sets.

(2)Database optimization Improved algorithm of Apriori raises the efficiency of  the algorithm by record each transaction in the log database using Boolean matrix. The specific definitions are as follows: Definition 1 Matrix of item sets I denoted by  11 12 1  21 22 2 1 2  1 2  ( , , , )  n  n n  p p pn  d d d d d d  D D D D  d d d Among which p is the number of transactions, n is the  number of items.

Definition 2 Each vector of item jI denoted by   j  j j  pj  t  t D  t  Among it,  j i  ij j i  I T t  I T .

Thus the Support count of jI is  sup _  p  j ij i  port count I t .

Definition 3 Vector of 2-item sets ,i jI I denoted by  1 1  2 2  i j  i j ij i j  pi pj  d d  d d D D D  d d Among which ? ? is the AND operator. Thus the Support count of 2-itemsets ,i jI I is  sup _ ,  p  i j ki kj k  port count I I d d .

Definition 4 Vector of k-item sets  1 2, , , kI I I denoted by  12 1 2 1 2 1k k k kD D D D D D D D  Thus the Support count of k-item sets 1 2, , , kI I I is  1 2 1 2 1  sup _ , , , p  k q q qk qk q  port count I I I d d d d

IV. APPLICATION OF THE IMPROVED APRIORI ALGORITHM IN THE ANALYSIS OF HIDDEN DANGER DATA  More and more coal mine hidden danger record entry are saved in the form of a database, we can do correlation analysis on the hidden danger properties of the hidden danger records to mining association rules between these data. Then to provide guidance for the management of coal mine safety decision-making advice, help to improve the efficiency of safety management and play a proactive role in prevention of the occurrence of the accident.

Following is a coal mine under a Bureau of Mines? 2137  hidden danger data between February to December 2011 in the coal mine workplace as an example to illustrate. Table I shows the extract from the hidden danger record table we are going to the association rule mining items.

The workplace safety hidden danger properties are divided into two tiers concept hierarchy: The first layer is [team attribute A, time attribute B,  location attribute C, hidden danger type attribute D].

The second layer is a refinement of the first layer: Team attribute [Monitoring team A1, Ventilation team A2,  Geodetic team A3, Transport team A4, Hydraulic mining team A5, Mechanical and electrical team A6].

This paper uses MATLAB7.0 programming in Core 2.0GHz PC to achieve the improved Apriori algorithm. The first step is to generate frequent item sets of safety hidden danger in the workplace. Then mine association rules between the hidden danger attributes according to the given minimum confidence threshold.

Set minimum support threshold min_sup of 5%, using  Apriori algorithm from an order set, calculate each order in turn frequently set of data items. The frequent item sets calculated results are as follows: 1 order frequent item sets: {A2?A3?A6? B3?B4?  C1?C4?D1?D3?D4?D8?D10} 2 order frequent item sets: {A2B3? A2B4? A2C1?  A2C4?A2D1?

A2B3D4?A2B4C1?A2B4C4?A2B4D1?A2B4D3?A2C1D1? A2C1D3 ? A2C1D10 ? A2C4D3 ? A2C4D10 ? A3B3C1 ? A3B3C4 ? A3B4C1 ? A3B4C4 ? A3C1D4 ? A3C1D10 ? A3C4D3?A3C4D8?A3C4D10?B3C1D1?B3C1D4?B4C1D3} 4 order frequent item sets: {A2B3C1D1? A2B3C1D4?  A2B3C4D8?A2B4C1D3?A3B3C1D4?A3B4C1D8 } And then proceed to the association rule mining, given  minimum confidence threshold min_conf of 8%, association rules must satisfy the condition: rules confidence ? min_conf.

According to the confidence and reverse confidence  formula: Confidence:  sup 100% /  sup port X Y  confidence X Y P Y X port X  Reverse Confidence:  sup 100% /  sup port X Y  confidence Y X P X Y port Y  System mining association rules and their confidences are shown as the following table.

TableII Association Rules and Confidences Table  association rule confidence reverse confidence  A2?B3C1D1 A2?B3C1D4 A2?B3C4D8 A2?B4C1D3 A3?B3C1D4 A3?B4C1D8 B3?A2C1D4 C1?A3B3D4 D4?A2B3C1  27.09 8.69 69.25 34.75 67.77 12.67 83.21 25.00 33.33  78.00 85.00 33.33 100.00 82.35 79.55 10.07 78.00 80.79  The 4th association rules in above table, for example, this association rules and their confidence indicate that confidence of the ventilation team occurs ventilation hidden danger in 18:00-24:00 time period at the wellhead face is 34.75%. And confidence of 18:00-24:00 time period at the wellhead face which occur ventilation hidden danger is the ventilation team is 100%. By this rule, we can give guidance to strengthen the work of the wellhead face hidden danger investigation between 18:00-24:00 hours in order to exclude hidden danger and prevent accidents more effectively.
