I. INTRODUCTION  The research and application of spatial data mining have  become hotspot for people. Spatial association rules is one of  important part of spatial data mining, which mainly extracts  these interactions, spatial dependency and spatial symbiosis  patterns with spatial objects as in [1]. Nowadays, traditional  association rules is expanded to spatial data mining, there are  mainly three kinds methods of mining spatial association  rules as in [2], such as, layer covered based on clustering as  in [2], mining approach based on spatial transaction as in [3,  4 and 5] and mining approach based on non-spatial  transaction as in [2]. Mining approach based on spatial  transaction uses spatial overlying and buffer analysis to  search spatial predicate of spatial objectives and other  objects in spatial database, and extracts Boolean association    rules from spatial transaction database formed by these  spatial predicate. This method is used to mining monolayer  transverse association rules and multilayer transverse  association rules, which is one of wide applied techniques.

Spatial topological relation is one of typical and important  multilayer spatial relation. And so, this paper introduces an  algorithm of mining spatial topology association rules based  on Apriori via mining approach based on spatial transaction,  which uses spatial topological relation as example to present  multilayer spatial association rules mining.

II. PRELIMINARY KNOWLEDGE  As we all know this basic knowledge as in [1, 2],  preliminary knowledge of spatial topology association rules  is expressed as follows:  Spatial association rules mainly contain three parts as  follows, spatial association among properties of the same  objects in the same spatial relation pattern, spatial  association among different objects in the same spatial  relation pattern and spatial association among different  objects in the different spatial relation pattern. The first part  is known as spatial lengthwise association, the second and  third parts are known as spatial transverse association.

Association rules expressing as the second spatial relation is  known as monolayer transverse spatial association rules.

Association rules expressing as the third spatial relation is  known as multilayer transverse spatial association rules.

According to mining approach based on spatial transaction,  this algorithm uses spatial topological relation as example  extracts multilayer spatial association rules, and so we only  thick seven kinds of spatial topology association as table 1.

Definition 1 Spatial Transaction to Binary Digit, a spatial  transaction expressing topological relation is denoted by  binary digit.

The course of turning spatial transaction into binary digit  is expressed as follows:  Step 1 , we define target object class and non-target object  class, target object class is denoted by Ot. There are m non  target objects classes, which are denoted by ik (k=l ...m).

Step2, we use 3 non-zero binary digits to denote a kind of  topological relation that expresses sole spatial topological    relation between target object and non-target object.

Step3, the number of bit is 3 times the number of classes  in non-target objects of spatial transaction database.

Step4, spatial topological relation is denoted by binary  digit as following table I .

TABLE 1. SPATIAL TOPOLOGICAL RELATION  No. Topological relation Spatial Predicate Binary Digit  1 disjoint disjoint (0" ik) (001)2  2 touch touch (0" ik) (010)2  3 overlap overlap (0" ik) (011)2  4 cover cover (0" ik) (100)2  5 contain contain (0" ik) (101)2  6 covered covered (0" ik) (110)2  7 inside inside (0" ik) (111)2  Here, we let (000)2 express this spatial relation that there  are no non-target objects in buffer of target objects.

Example, item sets of spatial non-target objects class is  expressed as 1= {iJ, i2, i3, i4, i5}, we also define the order of  binary digit according to the order of item sets.

Suppose here is a entity of target object class denoted by  Db Ot touches a entity of non-target object class as i2, spatial  predicate is denoted by touch (Db i2), namely, binary digit is  expressed as (01Oh. Ot contains a entity of non-target object  class as i3, spatial predicate is denoted by contain (Db i3),  namely, binary digit is expressed as (101h. Ot insides a  entity of non-target object class as i4, spatial predicate is  denoted by inside (Db i4), namely, binary digit is expressed  as (111 )2. All the entities of two non-target objects class as i[  and i5 are not in the buffer of the entity of target object class  as Ot. The spatial topological relation may be expressed as  Fig. 1, we also may use (000, 010, 101, 111, 000)2 express  the spatial to 010 ical relation.

0,  Figure 1. The spatial topological relation  Definition 2 Topological Relation Bit, it is a binary digit  with 3 bit, which expresses a kind of topological relation  between two entities of target object class and non-target  object class.

Example, if a spatial transaction is denoted as a binary  digit (000, 010, 101, 111, 000)2' we think (010)2, (101)2 and  (111)2 as Topological Relation Bit.

Definition 3 Spatial Transaction to Integer, a spatial    transaction expressing spatial topological relation is denoted  by an integer.

Example, if a spatial transaction is denoted by this binary  digit (000, 010, 101, 111, 000)2' we will use this integer 1390  to express this spatial transaction.

Definition 4 Spatial Transaction Length, which is  denoted as STL. Its value equals the number of non-target  objects class in buffer of entity of target object class. Namely,  it also equals the number of spatial topological relation  between two entities of target object class and non-target  object class.

Example, the spatial transaction as Fig.l is expressed as  {touch (Db i2), contain (Db i3), inside (Db i4)}, which is  expressed as binary digit p = (000, 010, 101, 111, 000)2, its  length equals to 3, namely, STL (P) = 3.

Definition 5 Transaction Relation to Integer Relation, a  spatial transaction ST[ is expressed as integer IJ, another ST2  is expressed as integer h if ST[ c Sh and we will define  I[ch  Example, item sets of non-target spatial object class is  expressed as 1= {iJ, i2, i3, i4, i5}' Let ST[ be {touch (Db i2),  contain (Db i3), inside (Db i4)}, denoted by 1390, let ST2 be   {contain (Db i3), inside (Db i4)}, denoted by 366. Obviously,  ST 2 c ST J, and then we record 366 c 1390.

Property 1 There are two binary digits p and q with m  Topological Relation Bits, p is used to express a spatial  transaction STp, q is used to express a spatial transaction STq  The necessary and sufficient condition for STp c STq is p /\  q = p, and STL(q/\(?p))= STL(q) -STL(P).

Proving of sufficient condition is expressed as follows:  We use TRBi express value of No.i Topological Relation  Bit in a binary digit.

Suppose, TRBi"* 0 (i = jt,j2 .. A, k<m) in this binary digit  p, and others are O. In these Topological Relation Bits, we let  No.bs (s =1, 2 ... t, t ? 3m) binary bit be 1, and others are O.

For p /\ q = p, and so in these Topological Relation Bits of q,  these No.bs (s =1,2 ... t, t ? 3m) binary bits are all equal to 1  (otherwise, p /\ q "* p), and others are 0 or 1.

And for STL(q/\(?p))= STL(q) -STL(p), and so TRBi "*  o (i = j[,j2 .. A, k<m) in this binary digit q are all equal to the  same Topological Relation Bit in this binary digit p    (otherwise, STL(q /\ (?p)) "* STL(q) - STL(p)), and others  are 0 or 1. As definition 1 and 5, we know STp C STw  Proving of necessary condition is expressed as follows:  Suppose, TRBi"* 0 (i = jJ,j2" jb k<m) in this binary digit  p, and others are O. In these Topological Relation Bits, we let  No.bs (s =1, 2 ... 1, t ? 3m) binary bit be 1, and others are O.

For STp c STq, according to definition 1 and 5, and so TRBi  "* 0 (i = jhh .. A, k<m) in this binary digit q are all equal to  the same Topological Relation Bit in this binary digit p  (otherwise, here is NoA spatial topological relation, it  belongs to STp, but it doesn't belong to STq, this contradicts  with STp C STq), and so in these Topological Relation Bits of  binary digit q, these No.bs (s =1, 2 ... t, t ? 3m) binary bits are  alII, and others are O. And so the rest of binary bits in binary  digit q are 0 or 1. Hence, p /\ q = p, and STL( q /\ (?p))=  STL(q) -STL(P).

Deduction 1 There are two binary digits p and q. If P is  turned into integer Ip, q is turned into integer Iq, and p /\ q =  p, and Ip ? Iq.

Deduction 2 Let integer Ip express a spatial transaction  STp, and let integer Iq express a spatial transaction STw If Iq ?

Ip, and STp ct. STq  Property 2 Let binary digit p express spatial transaction  STp, and let binary digit q express spatial transaction STw  Andp /\ q =p,andSTL(q/\(?p))=STL(q) -STL(P).

If STq is a frequent itemset, and STp is also a frequent  itemset.

If STp is not a frequent itemset, and STq is not also a  frequent itemset.



III. THE ALGORITHM OF MINING SPATIAL TOPOLOGY  ASSOCIATION RULES  A. Forming Mining Database  In order to form mining database of spatial topology  association rules, from original spatial database, we need  turn spatial transaction into a digit. The course of turning  used by the algorithm is described as follows:  Firstly, we define target object class 0 and non-target  object class ik (k=1...m), and then define the order of non  target object class as 1= {iJ, i2 ... im}, and so each non-target  object class h existing in spatial transaction has an order  denoted by Nk If there is a kind of spatial topological  relation as table I between entities of target object class and    non-target object class Ik, obviously, according to definition  1 and 2, this spatial topological relation is able to be denoted  by some Topological Relation Bit as table I. And then. we will put this Topological Relation Bit in  No.k 10catlOn.

Finally, we will gain a binary digit with 3m bit.

According to this way, the algorithm will gain a digit by  scanning every spatial transaction, and mining database is  formed of these digits.

Now we save these digits by this data structure expressed  as follows:  Structure spatial transaction {  Int Digit; I I saving digit expressed as spatial transaction  Int Count; II saving the sum of same digit expressed as  spatial transaction} ST  Example, here is three entities of target objects class as  OJ, O2 and 03, and non-target object class 1= {iJ, i2 ... is}.

No.1 spatial transaction ST] is expressed as {touch (OJ,  i2), contain (0], i3), inside (OJ, i4)}, we use binary digit p =  (000,010, 101, 111,000)2 to express this spatial transaction,  namely, this integer 1390 may express ST].

ST [1 ].Digit= 1390, ST [1 ].Count= 1.

No.2 spatial transaction ST2 is expressed as {contain (02,  i3), inside (02, i4)}, we use binary digit p = (000, 000, 10 ?,  111, 000)2 to express this spatial transaction, namely, thIS  integer 366 may express ST2  ST [2].Digit=366, ST [2].Count=1.

No.3 spatial transaction ST3 is expressed as {touch (03,  i2), contain (03, i3), inside (03, i4)}, we use binary digit p =  (000, 010, 10 1, 111, 000)2 to express this spatial transactio?,  namely, this integer 1390 may express ST3 As thIS  information has been saved, we only add 1 to Count.

ST [1 ].Digit= 1390, ST [1 ].Count=2 ...

B. The course of generating frequent topological item sets  The course of generating frequent topological item sets is  similar to Apriori, namely, according to down-top search  strategy, the algorithm uses three stages to generate frequent  topological item sets, which is expressed as follows: .

Firstly, the algorithm computes all these I-topologIcal  item sets, and gains all the I-frequent topological item set?.

Secondly, the algorithm connects I-frequent topolOgIcal  item sets to generate these entire 2-candidate frequent  topological item sets.

Finally, the algorithm computes (k+ I)-candidate frequent  topological item sets, and generates all these (k+l )-frequent  topological item sets (k> 1) by iteration connecting.

C. The method of computing support  According to property 2, we know that the method of  computing support is formed two steps as follows:  Let an integer Iq express a spatial transaction ST q, let  another Ip express a candidate frequent item sets CSTp.

Stepl , computing this value Ip /\ Iq , if Ip /\ Iq * Ip, we  will know that CSTp ct ST q, namely, the spatial transaction  ST q does not support candidate frequent itemsets CSTp. If Ip  /\ Iq = Ip, then going to step2.

Step2, if STL{lq /\ (? Ip))= STL{lq) - STL(Ip), and  CSTp C STq. And so we will know that the spatial transact?on  ST supports candidate frequent itemsets CSTp. OtherwIse,  the  q  spatial transaction STq does not support candidate  frequent itemsets CSTp.

D. The process of mining topology association rules  According to the down-top search strategy of Apriori, the  process of Inining topology rules is expressed as follows: .

Step 1 , the algorithm computes all these I-topologIcal  item sets, and gains all the I-frequent topological item sets.

Step2, the algorithm connects I-frequent topological i?em  sets to generate these entire 2-candidate frequent topologIcal  item sets.

Step3, the algorithm computes (k+l )-candidate frequent  topological item sets, and generates all these (k+1)-frequent  topological item sets (k> I) by iteration connecting. . . Step4, the algorithm outputs all frequent  topologIcal Item  sets.

Step5, according to confidence given by user, the  algorithm computes all topology association rules.



IV. THE ANALYSIS AND EXPERIMENTAL RESULT OF  ALGORITHM  Nowadays, there are very little documents of research  spatial topology association rules. Here we only present the  capability and experimental result of the algorithm:  A. The Analysis of Capability  The algorithm is suitable for mining short frequent    topological item sets because it adopts down-top search  strategy to generate candidate frequent topological item sets.

B. The experimental result of the algorithm  Now we use experiment to prove above analyses.
