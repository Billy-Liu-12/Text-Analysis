Spatial distribution, evolution and driving force of floating population of Chongqing  Municipality in 2000-2010

ABSTRACT: This paper studies the spatial distribution,  evolution and driving force behind the floating population in  Chongqing Municipality from 2000 to 2010. The research is based on the data of the fifth and sixth population censuses and  the temporary resident censuses for those same years. The paper  will first introduce characteristics of Chongqing's decline and  rise in population from 1996 to 2010. Chongqing had continually been in the mode of population outflow but this trend stopped in  2007. Second, the author analyzes the spatial divergence evolution of floating population (FP) among Chongqing's districts and counties from 2000 to 2010. The performance in population absorption of four planning policy areas was studied  and the outcome shows that many peripheral districts and  counties transferred from population inflow to outflow,  especially those with preferential policies. Both the population  and economy proportions of the One Hour Circle area and the  regional centers shrunk from 2000 to 2010. Third, the correlation between FP distribution and economic and income factors confirmed, with some notable exceptions, the rule that  people tend to migrate towards these areas with a booming economy, preferential policies and higher income. In short, after  having been designated as a municipality directly under the  Central Government and having 13 years of strong economic development, Chongqing municipality is still losing its labor  force rather than absorbing it. The factors determining the  floating population's location are not institutional, but economic,  such as industrial development and transportation conditions.

Differing from other developed cities in east China, the inflow  population of Chongqing is mainly concentrated in the city  proper. The effect of the spatial policies in Chongqing is not very  evident, not that there is something wrong with the spatial  policies, but highlighting the need for more cooperation between  spatial and non-spatial policies.

I. INTRODUCTION  Before 1997, Chongqing Municipality was part of Sichuan province. However, to better organize the Three Gorges project immigration work, an area with an independent administrative status equal to a province was necessary. At that time, Chongqing municipality was upgraded to a Zhixia municipality, one which was directly under the central government. This was the third time in modern times that Chongqing had become a Zhixia munilipatily. The fIrst was in 1939, during the Anti-Japanese War (1937-1945) when the Nationalist Party Government moved to this inland city and brought a large amount of  industries and an influx of population. After the war, the population of Chongqing increased by about 900,000 and one-tenth of them were military workers. From that time forward, Chongqing became an important centre for Chinese industry. The second time lasted from 1950-1954, at the initial founding of the People's Republic of China, which can be viewed as an inheritance of its post-war economic prosperity .

The ambitious Three Gorges Project can be attributed to Sun Yat-sen, the founder of Republican China and who has also been honored as the father of modern China. When the Chinese Communist Party decided to begin the project, they thought it necessary to form a Three Gorges administrative region (or something similar) to take charge of the massive emigration of millions of people. Instead of creating a new region altogether, the government decided to make Chongqing Municipality almost equivalent to a province with Zhixia status. The territory of this new Zhixia municipality included the former Chongqing, Wanxian, Fuling and Qiangjiang areas which had all belonged to Sichuan before the upgrade in status. The new area consisted of 81411 k m' with a population of more than 30 million. This new colossal municipality was poverty-stricken with 43% of its population living in poor conditions and the GDP (Gross Domestic Product) per capita at only one-third of that in Beijing and one-quarter of that in Shanghai in 1996. Both of those cities were also Zhixia municipalities [II.

From 1996 to 2010, the annual GDP of Chongqing has grown from 133 billion to 793 billion and the revenue of local government has risen from 5.5 billion to 199.1 billion.

During that same time period, per capita disposable income of metropolitan households increased from 5,023 yuan to 19,100 Yuan. Chongqing is now a crucial inland advanced manufacturing and modern service industry base, an innovation centre and the southwest integrated traffIc hub.

The Chongqing's industrial base has transformed from a high majority of military plants to include many different types of industries such as mechanical, comprehensive chemical, pharmaceutical and manufacturing industries.

Chongqing is still the largest weapon production base in China. It is also an important offshore fmancial centre and international fmancial settlement centre in China with 6.1 % of its GDP contributed from the fmancial sector. Chongqing has the third highest amount of retail commodities trading in China after Shanghai and Guangzhou. Ten local enterprises in Chongqing are listed among China's top 500, leading all municipalities in western China.

In 2009, according to the national urban planning system, Chongqing became one of the five national central cities of China. It also was the only one of the five cities located in Midwest China. Chongqing is also a pilot district of the national urban-rural coordination reform testing region.

Additionally, the Liangjiang New District in Chongqing, established in 2010, became the first ever national level new district in inland China. Under this vibrant circumstance, the Chongqing government revised its master plan in 2007 and formed a regional spatial structure consisting of one circle and two wings. The circle represented areas which could be reached in one hour from the metropolitan area, and included 23 districts or counties. The two wings represented the northeast Three Gorges Dam affected areas and the southeast combination of Wujiang River Catchments and Wulin Mountain Areas. The separate wings are composed of 11 and 6 districts or counties respectively. According to the new master plan, the goals for these two wings, which had been majority rural and poverty areas, were to launch ecological emigration and facilitate transfer of surplus farm laborer.

B. Goal, analytical approach, definition and data The main propose of the paper is to quantitatively  measure the dynamics of floating population and its spatial pattern and to discuss how its evolution interacts with economic and industrial development and urban policy. The administrative level of a Chinese city, to a large extent, determines its institutional resources and autonomous power.

Therefore, the institutional environment of the Chongqing municipality changed a lot after being upgraded to a Zhixia municipality. The Chongqing government also implemented a large number of intervention measures in regard to its spatial development. This paper aims to evaluate the actual effects of these institutional changes and spatial policies by measuring labor absorption and dispersion in different areas of the Chongqing municipality.

The paper quantizes the spatial distribution by analyzing the variation of its absolute amount and location quotient of  the floating population (FP) from 2000 to 2010 at the district and county level. It also analyzes the FP concentration degree for the territory area by calculating the difference index and concentration index.

FP, as a concept, comes from China's distinct institution of Hukou (household registration system). It is defined as those populations which migrate to someplace without transferring their Hukou register to their new destination.

Floating population incorporates both inflow and outflow population. Inflow population (lP) refers to those living in a location without Hukou for at least half a year. The outflow population (OP) refers to those who keep their Hukou in a location but did not live there for at least half a year.

Permanent population (PP) refers to those populations living in a location at least a half a year before a census period, whether they had Hukou in that location or not.

Registered population (RP) is merely that population which possessed Hukou, with no regard given to their actual place of residence. By looking at census data, we can determine the registered population (the population with Hukou) and permanent residents and the difference between the two is generally the net floating population. The data of PP and RP used in this study are from the fifth and sixth population censuses taken in 2000 and 2010 at both the district and county level. The economic and other data comes from statistic yearbooks.

In China, the Public Security Bureau takes charge of the registration and management of IP. The registered IP was classified as temporary population (TP) which has its own decennial report. This TP census data has more detailed information which can be used to a better analyze the features of IP. The TP data used in this paper are from the provincial level temporary resident censuses of 2000 and 2010.

This article is organized into five additional sections. The first is a review of prior research on the spatial distribution features of FP and its influencing factors. The second is an introduction of overall development of Chongqing's     population after 1997. The third section analyzes and compares the location quotient, difference index and concentration index to demonstrate the FP spatial difference among districts and counties of Chongqing. In the fourth section, the article lays out a correlation analysis between the population evolution and various influencing factors, as well as some explanations to certain exceptions. The fmal section comprises a conclusion and discussion of the results.

C. Prior research Migration is a common and unavoidable phenomenon in  a market economy and in a growing urbanized society. In China, due to a series of institution barriers, China's migration is characteristically different from migration in other nations. The focus of this part of the article concentrates on the research of FP spatial distribution in the province and municipality level. Some past studies have shown that in these areas, especially in those areas with a highly developed export-oriented economy, the spatial distribution of inflow pOJ)ulation displays an obvious trend of hierarchy and gradation [2,3.4.51. In some other areas, it has a strong relationship with the city level, population size, natural conditions such as topography and other such classifications [6.7.81.

What are the influencing factors of floating population distribution? Some researchers have attributed it to the territory divergence of foreign investment[91, industrial development[Io? adjustment and transformation of industrial structure, lower cost of living, lifestyle preference, administrative control, infrastructure, etc[5,1O, Ill.

Simultaneously, there exists a significant difference between the floating population located in urban areas and suburban areas in source, time of residence, age, education level, occu?ation, income, household and housing conditions etc etc[4. 21.

According to a study by Y. Yang and C. Zhan[131, from 2000 to 2008, emigrated population accounts for a main part of the total floating population of Chongqing. However, compared to 1990, the proportion of immigrants increased, especially those classified as business immigrants. In 2000, agricultural production such as fanning, fishing and forestry dominated the list of original occupations for internal migrants of Chongqing. But for external migrants, a large proportion of which were better educated, a high percentage of their original occupations were in the professional and technical, commercial and service fields[141.

Current research on floating population distribution at the province and municipal level is predominantly focused on those stronger economically developed provinces and cities which process a large amount of inflow population. Scarce, is the research on developing areas like the Chongqing municipality, which is currently a hotbed for policy reform.

Prior research has tended to treat the study area as an intact entity and use statically descriptive analysis. That research lacked transverse comparison at a more detailed spatial level or longitudinal comparison of a specific period. Previous studies have also lacked deeper discussion of the relationship between floating population distribution and the socio? economic development and evolving spatial policies at the  sub-municipal level. A deeper discussion and analysis is exactly the new knowledge which China's planning discipline is calling for and this paper tries to provide it during this process of transfonning from a planned economy to a market economy.



II. OVERALL DEVELOPMENT OF CHONGQING'S POPULATION AFTER 1997  A. Total amount variation From 1996 to 2010, the permanent resident population of  the Chongqing municipality underwent two noticeable trends. For the first nine years of that period, the popUlation declined and then steadily rose from 2005 until 2010.

However, the amount of permanent urban residents around Chongqing kept increasing at a relatively high rate of 4% which was to be expected with China's trend of urbanization.

In 2009, the registered urban population showed an abrupt increase. This may have been due to a loosening in the Hukou transfer policy. Although the Houku policy reforms did not officially take place until 2010, the gradual slacking of institutional barriers for rural-urban migration wes realized sooner. Chongqing has been classified as a popUlation outflow city for many years. From 1996 to 2007 the outflow population increased from 1.47 million to 4.19 million and then fluctuated through 2010.

B. Chongqing's temporary population variation among China and their occupations  Due to the existence of some institutional barriers as seen in the Hukou system, many immigrants did not permanently settle down in their new locations and had to be identified as temporary popUlation (TP) by authorities. The data in 2000 and 2010 (Table 1) shows that: (1) The rate increase and proportion of TP of Chongqing municipality is about to catch up with Tianjin, another less-developed Zhixia city, but still far from Beijing and Shanghai. However, since Chongqing has a much larger territory, the actual gap between Chongqing and the other Zhixia cities is much larger than the figure represents. (2) The main parts of population     absorption are still traditionally the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and the Pearl River Delta (PRD). While Guangdong Province still tops the list with 21 % of all total population absorption, it is much lower than its 30% total in the 2000 census. Guangdong has now become the province which has lost the largest percentage of TP. However, in the YRD, there is a different trend that has appeared. Shanghai, Jiangshu and Zhejiang provinces are leading the increase of TP and constitute 12.3% of the whole in an aggregate. (3) While it will take a longer time for the TP population in Chongqing to catch up with other more developed municipalities and provinces, it has shown a sign of eventually outpacing other western provinces. Its proportion of temporary resident tops them with a 0.76% increase rate from 2000 to 2010, except Xijiang province.

The economic prosperity Chongqing has encountered is due to its secondary industry development. The main career for the TP is factory/industrial worker and that position makes up 23.87% of total TP residents. This coincides with a 21.42% increase ratio of secondary industry development which made up 55.00% of the entire gross domestic product in 20lO, compared to only 43.27% in 1996. It is interesting to note that while the share of the primary industry is decreasing, Chongqing had attracted almost 12 thousand immigrant farmers between in 20lO. which is the third main career of the TP (Table 2).

III. THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION EVOLUTION OF FLOATING POPULATION AT DISTRICT AND COUNTY LEVEL FROM 2000 TO   A. Spatial distribution divergence among districts and counties  To evaluate the overall spatial distribution divergence of FP in Chongqing municipality, the range, standard deviation and weighted coefficient I of variation of the location quotients 2 of Chongqing FP in 2000 and 2010 were measured. (Table 3) The range and standard deviation of location quotient of FP decreased, indicating that the absolute spatial divergence deceased. But the weighted coefficient of variation increased, showing that the relative divergence of the LQ had actually increased. Taken in sum, we can see the spatial distribution of Chongqing's floating population became more unstable between its districts and counties from 2000 to 2010.

2 The notion location quotient comes from regional economics and was used to measure the relatively concentrated level of a certain industry to a certain region. In the paper, it is used to measure the relatively concentrated level of floating population among Chongqing municipality. The FP location quotient stands for the ratio of the proportion ofFP ofPP in a certain district or county to  Fi the proportion ofFP ofPP in Chongqing, is that LQ = .!jj-. F i  and P i  p refers to the FP and PP of a certain district or county; F and P refer to the FP and PP of the whole Chongqing municipality.

These districts and counties had been divided into a population inflow group (15 districts and counties in 2000 and 9 districts and counties in 20 lO) and an outflow group (25 districts and counties in 2000 and 31 districts and counties in 2010) and calculated respectively (Table 4). Both of the two groups had declines in their difference index and the concentration index, which illustrates less spatial concentration of FP to the territory, meaning: the spatial unbalanced distribution was weakened.

Concentration index refers the concentration degree ofFP to the territory. when rank and add the  FP of each district or county from less to more to the half of the total FP , the value of the ratio of the added area of these districts and counties to the total area is concentration index. A bigger concentration index value indicates a more concentrate distribution ofFP to territory.

Spatial divergence evolution of the four policy regions As mentioned before, the Chongqing government revised  its master plan and divided its territory into one circle and two wings. The one circle area incorporated the metropolitan area (MA) and some other districts and counties which for the purpose of this paper are called emerging metropolitan areas (EMA). To evaluate the actual effects of the government's spatial intervention policies on labor absorption and dispersion, the paper compares the FP     location quotient difference between 2000 and 2010 (Figure 4), and concludes: (1) Some districts and counties in EMA, even in Northeast Wing (NW) and Southeast Wing (SW) met the conditions of population inflow in 2000. But in 2010, it turned out that the entire area of EMA, SW and NW became population outflow areas. The districts and counties switching from inflow to outflow were Bishan, Qijiang, Fuling (EMA), Fengdu, Chengkou (NW) and Wulong (SW).

(2) The main population inflow area still focused on the MA.

The top 5 districts in 2010 were Jiangbei, Jiulongpo, Yubei, Dadulou and Shapingba. This sequence was almost unchanged from 2000, except the Yubei district, which was formed in 1994 and is the main part of the Liangjiang New District; it climbed from seventh to third in population count for inflow areas. (3) Both of the regional centers of NW and SW - Wazhou and Qijiang - met outflow conditions and had increased outflow population in absolute terms, but increased in location quotient.

This analysis may show that even the government would like to boost the development of the EMA area and the regional centers. Both of these areas had their population and economy proportions among the whole municipality  steadily growing and becoming more popular with manufactures. Abbreviations and Acronyms  Defme abbreviations and acronyms the fust time they are used in the text, even after they have been defmed in the abstract. Abbreviations such as IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, sc, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable.

A. Economic factors 1) Economic development  Some prior studies have shown[5.15] that the aggregation of non-registered population (similar to the notion of temporary resident) has a correlation with a certain district's GDP, Fixed Investments and the development of private companies. The analysis of Chongqing municipality has typically supported this argument (Table 6). Moreover, there is statistical correlation between FP and total retail sales of consumer goods in Chongqing which does not exist in other areas [5.16]. However, for the detailed case analysis, there are some exceptions. Kaixian, Jiangjing, Rongchang and Wanzhou ranked 20th, lith, 5th and 4th respectively in their  TABLE V.

What policy reforms had been taken in these areas? What is the relationship between this situation and these policies? More study and explanation will be put forward in our next section.



IV. THE DRlVING FORCE OF FLOATING POPULATION DISTRIBUTION  Unlike the developed cities in eastern China, whose migrants tend to located in suburban or fringe areas, the main feature of migrant distribution in Chongqing is their concentrated population within the districts of MA area except Yuzhong district. This area has traditionally been an industrial area. It is currently undergoing an industrial transformation, changing from large state owned factories founded during the planned market period to the more modern and advanced manufacturing and service industry, now under various kinds of ownership. The functions of the lands were also transferred from relatively unitary plants and living quarters to office complexes, commerce, hotels, entertainment districts, and residences. At the same time, a new industrial district, Yubei, in the Liangjiang New area is  2010 if  GDP Floating GDP Gross Domestic  Proportion Population Product (million)  Proportion (%) (thousand) (%)  38.20 1,338 349,083 44.78  38.93 -843 614,532 32.81  17.49 -2,525 134,753 16.96  5.38 -821 43,273 5.45  100.00 -4,188 792,558 100.00  GDP, but only 40th, 34th, 27th and 26th in FP. The biggest exceptions to the general rule were Rognchang and Wanzhou. They had an annual GDP increase of 30% and 23% from 2000 to 2010, but their pennanent residents did not increase significantly. The pennanent resident population increased only slightly in the Rongchang district at 0.03% annually. The Wanzhou district had a drop in permanent residents, falling 0.52% annually. Ironically, both Jiangjin and Wanzhou are regional centers and Kaixian county is the sub- regional centre as designated by the new master plan.

The term "development zone" refers to specific areas designated by governments of all levels, managed independently and implementing various preferential policies to foster economic development and urbanization[171. Some research has shown that due to the relatively small number of institutional restraints and rapid job growth, abundant working-age people would be attracted to and become temporary residents in these development zones[181.

Correlation analysis indicates that the establishment of development zones was statistically significant upon the FP location quotient of these districts or counties (Table 7).

These results have been recognized as a good way to gauge the success of development zone policies in absorbing the labor force.

For the two districts partially designated national development zones in the EMA and NW area, Changshou and Wanzhou, both achieved great economic success but failed to maintain their population. There could be a simple explanation for the two areas losing population. It may be due to their capital-intensive industrial model or a squeezing effect on the lesser educated and skilled population. After losing their farmland, a great number of the rural population in Changshou and Wanzhou had few qualifications to be employed in the burgeoning industries, which at the same time had not yet expanded enough to support some traditional consumer services which would be better suited for those former farmers. The end effect was the farmers were squeezed out of their homeland because no opportunity for work existed.

Improvement of transportation condition According to Ravenstein's Laws of Migration, cited from  [19], the proportion of migration grows less when distance increases and the facilities of transportation and communication may countervail the disadvantages of distance and promote popUlation outflow. A model of Ravenstein's Laws of Migration can be seen in the periphery areas of Chongqing. The 4C Wanzhou airport and the Yu? Sui high speed railway opened in 2003 and 2006 respectively. In 2007, Yu-Huai railway was opened to passenger traffic for the entire line, which went through the most impoverished southeast area of Chongqing to Huaihua, Guizhou province. This railway has been called by many as a railway which aids the poor. In term of highways, the annual increase rate of highway length in the EMA and SW areas were 24.l% and 27.9% from 2004 to 2010, higher than the 2l.0% of the EA area and 18.3% of the NA area.

Paradoxically, Chongqing has many competitive advantages over other Chinese CitIes in attracting manufacturing industries. To maintain those competitive advantages, modes of transportation will undoubtedly be improved in the coming years. However, by looking closer at current circumstances, we can determine that regional population and urbanization will not increase if the only policy undertaken is promoting new and improved transportation. For increased popUlation growth and urbanization, policies promoting the enterprise marketing environment and cutting regulations and red tape for establishing businesses would be more helpful.

C. Regional income gap The correlation between FP location quotient and income  for 2010 (no data for 2000) was analyzed and showed a significant difference between the two. (Table 8). Areas with higher residential income had more inflow population and those with lower income had more outflow. The analysis also found that districts and counties with a lower urban? rural income gap had a tendency to attract a higher inflow population. This fmding confirms the law of people migrating from low income areas to where they may obtain higher incomes. However, there are two notable exceptions to this rule. Jiangjin and Hechuan, districts, which had preferential policies, showed weakness in population absorption even with a low urban-rural income gap.

V. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION  Form the above analysis, the overall spatial distribution of FP of Chongqing became more unstable from 2000 to 2010. The divergence between population inflow and outflow became larger among the districts and counties in Chongqing municipality. However, the extent of spatial distribution to territory was weakened.

The population inflow of Chongqing was mainly concentrated in the city proper. This differs greatly from the more developed cities in east China. In Chongqing, The centripetal effect of FP distribution is predominate. Due to the implementation of massive industrial and land renewal projects, this trend of population inflow concentration in the city proper may continue in the near future. At the same time, the prosperity and rapid population expansion of Yubei district (the future Liangjiang New district), a fast growing development zone near the city proper, is quite evident.

However, the prospects of the peripheral counties and sub? center cities such as Wanzhou and Qiangjiang are not so clear. Along with the improvement of transportation systems and the implementation of many industrial projects, more     rural residents may be pushed out of these areas in the near future due to a lack of education and job ski lis.

The institutional barriers in Chongqing, a mega city in mid-west China, are not as solid as in more developed cities in the east. The main restriction of population and labor development is the economic and industrial progress itself, as well as some micro factors like cost of living, and the employment and entrepreneurial environment. It is necessary to point out that economic and industrial progress will not consequently lead to the development of population and improved quality of life. The effect of spatial policy in Chongqing is not very evident. This does not mean there is something found faulty with the spatial policies implemented, but instead, means that more cooperation of spatial and non-spatial policies are needed.

For Chongqing municipality, whose territory is as large as a province, the study at the district and county level is still too general. It would be much more beneficial if the data were detailed enough to support an analysis at the community level. For the lack of data, there may be more important influencing effects that were missed from this study, such as the divergence of living cost and the capability of public service between districts and counties. The author wishes to proceed with further study on these issues when detailed data becomes available or by supplementing information by way of questionnaires and interviews.
