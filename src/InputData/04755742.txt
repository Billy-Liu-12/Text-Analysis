The State of IT Governance in Organizations from the Public Sector in a  Developing Country

Abstract  Today in many organizations in the public sector, the use of IT has become crucial in sustaining and extending the organizations? strategies and objectives.

This pervasive use of technology has caused a critical dependency on IT that calls for specific focus on the IT Governance. This paper discusses the current state of IT Governance practices in five public sector organizations from a developing country, like is Tanzania. The results of this research approach are looking into the IT Governance mechanisms in place in terms of structures, processes and relational mechanisms. Moreover the paper includes a discussion on the problems and consequences inherent to inhibitors of effective IT Governance for a further improvement of the public service delivery in this environment.

1. Introduction Many organizations today rely on Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and continue to make significant IT-enabled business investments [1].

Public sector organizations are among them. This is due to, among other things, the constantly increasing demand for more efficient and cost-effective services for citizens, businesses and also among public organizations themselves and the continuing effort to embrace e-government [3], [22]. Furthermore this has led to pervasiveness and dependency on IT in the current dynamic and often turbulent multiservice provision environments, where effective management of IT and its alignment with business goals is essential for the success.

The prudent management of such IT environment calls for IT Governance, which is the organizational capacity to plan and control the formulation and implementation of IT strategy to ensure fusion of business and IT [4]. For example, the MIT/CISR study on IT Governance related issues indicated that there is a 20% better return on IT-enabled business investments when effective IT Governance is in place [5].

A need for effective IT Governance is also becoming  essential in the public sector in developing countries, in which various adjustments of regulatory and commercial policies, both macroeconomic and within ICT?s converging sector have been made and where the public sector organizations in particular experienced dramatic changes in the use of ICT [6].

Today, there is general use of the computers, specific business applications and a variety of IT organizations in most of them. However, like in many developing nations these developments are coupled with a variety of fragmented IT initiatives and relatively lower IT deployment, management, literacy, culture and resources [7], [8].

Therefore this paper describes the state of IT Governance based on the results of ongoing research in five public sector organizations in Tanzania. Mainly it analyzes two important aspects. The first aspect assesses the current state of IT Governance mainly regarding the mechanisms in use [9] and how these are contributing to a better Governance of IT in the public sector in Tanzania. Moreover the analysis considers the practices along IT Governance key focus areas [10] and key decisions [5]. Secondly the research addresses IT Governance related problems and the potential consequences in the studied organizations.

2. The studied organizations from the public sector in Tanzania In order to understand the IT Governance practices in the pubic sector, five organizations were selected. This was based on the level of IT deployment in the organizations and the multiplier effect in the services provided to the public and related organizations. By virtue of being public sector and in a developing country, the way they establish, use and manage ICT represents fairly the state of IT Governance in other organizations of similar set-up and environment. These organizations are the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA), Medical Stores Department (MSD), Prime Minister?s Office - Regional Administration and Local Government (PMO-RALG), President?s Office, Public Services Management (PO-PSM) and the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs (MoFEA).

TRA (A) is an authority liable for administration of central government revenues. Through its 1st, 2nd and now 3rd corporate strategic plans, various initiatives including IT have been implemented towards more efficient and cost-effective revenue collection. For example, while in 2003/04 about US$1.4 billion was collected by close to 3,457 employees, 46 being IT staff, in the last financial year, 2007/08, TRA expected to exceed the planned budget of about US$3.3 billion by almost the same number of employees. Also the authority has an organization-wide operating budget estimated at US$115m with IT using US$1.3m.

Computerization has been undertaken and a number of systems are in place such as Integrated Income Tax IS (ITAX) and Customs Management IS (ASYCUDA).

Most of the staff have undergone IT literacy courses and have computers that are also connected to the corporate network and the Internet [11], [19].

MSD (B) is an autonomous body under the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare with the objective to develop, maintain and manage an efficient and cost-effective system of procurement, storage and distribution of approved essential drugs and other medical supplies required for use across the country. It has a country-wide distribution network with 9 zones and serves a customer base of about 4,000 health facilities in different programmes. Also it serves district, regional, specialized and referral hospitals.

Through its corporate strategic plan and an expanding infrastructure, MSD services have raised from about US$14m in 1998 to US$100m in the 2006/07 financial year. It is managed by over 350 employees, 9 of them being IT staff.  Computerization has been undertaken mainly with ORION system that manages procurement, storage and distribution of medical supplies and recently the Integrated Logistics System (ILS) that manages varied health supplies using a single set of procedures. Also many staff have attended IT literacy courses and most have PCs that are also connected to the corporate network [12].

PMO-RALG (C) is the Ministry with a mandate to coordinate regional and local government affairs.

Through its strategic plans and the Local Government Reform Programme (LGRP), the Ministry has been improving its coordinating functions where 21 Regional Secretariats (RSs) have been enabled and 133 Local Government Authorities (LGAs) empowered to provide public services in their localities. Currently, the Ministry is supported by 250 staff, six of whom are IT staff. Additionally, there is one IT staff at each of the 21 RSs who also provides assistance to the LGAs in the area. Computerization has been undertaken and the main systems in place include the Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS), Planning and Reporting (PlanRep), Local Government Monitoring Database (LGMD) and LGAs ByLaws  Database. A number of staff have computers but there is still a notable demand which gets greater down the ministry hierarchy, RSs and LGAs. A number of staff, especially in the Ministry itself, have undergone IT literacy courses and most of them have PCs connected to the corporate network. However, there are relatively IT access difficulties at RSs and LGAs level [13].

PO-PSM (D) is a Ministry under the President's Office in charge of public service management, to ensure that Public Service is effectively and efficiently managed through improved human resources management, systems and structures. Through various strategic plans, the Ministry has put in place a Human Capital Management Information Systems (HCMIS) that manages all government employees, currently about 400,000. The Ministry also facilitates the Public Service Reform Programme (PSRP) that has empowered Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) in various aspects of public service delivery improvement, including putting in place several ICT facilities, applications, Strategic Plans (ISSP) and capacity building. Currently, the Ministry has a budget of about US$ 35.7m, with 2.85m for IT (8%) and supported by 300 staff, 15 of whom are IT staff [14].

MoFEA (E) is the ministry responsible for managing government revenue, expenditure and financing and provides advice on the broad financial and economic affairs in support of the government?s economic and social objectives. Through its strategic plans and the Public Financial Management Reform Programme (PFMRP), among other achievements, it has introduced several IS to facilitate its role. These include the IFMIS that manages the budget and expenditure and is rolled-out countrywide. Together with PO-PSM, the said Ministry has established the HCMIS that runs the payroll for government employees. Currently, the Ministry is supported by 1,200 staff, 100 of whom are IT staff [15].

3. Research Methodology In order to describe, understand and explain the IT Governance practices in the public sector and uncover problems and consequences in this environment, a qualitative research methodology [16] was used. This was mainly done through a case study research methodology [17]. Such approach was necessary to be able to carry out a holistic and in-depth investigation of the problem, and get the required details from the viewpoint of the participants, using multiple sources of data [27]. Also a multi-case approach was necessary due to the existence of several similarly patterned organizations in the public sector and a need to strengthen the results by replicating the pattern- matching, thus increasing confidence in the robustness of the outputs (17). Consequently, five cases were      Figure 1: Nine top most IT Governance context/drivers in the studied organizations from the public sector  Figure 2:  The necessary elements of an IT Governance framework [9]  selected to meet these needs as were described earlier.

The collection of the data was carried out by  conducting face to face in-depth interviews and through structured questionnaires. This process was undertaken between December 2007 and June 2008 with both IT and business representatives from five organizations from the public sector in Tanzania. In these organizations IT representatives included IT directors and managers, while business representatives included core and support services directors and managers as well as Chief Executives Officers (CEOs) and board members where applicable. Based on the IT Governance framework [9], key focus areas [10], key decisions [5] and IT Governance Assessment Process Model [18], five interview questionnaires were developed; two for IT peoples (CIO and the rest) and three for business peoples (directors/managers, CEOs and Board members (BM)). The distribution of the respondents is shown in Table 1.

Also in each organization as part of our study, other data were collected including organizations? brochures, strategic and action plans, policies, reports, presentations, and so forth. These data were mainly obtained from the Chief Information Officer (CIO) (known as Director of IT, IS, MIS or IT services).

Table 1: Distribution of the respondents  Respondents\Organiz ations  A B C D E Total  IT Management 8 5 5 6 7 31 Business Management including  CEO & BM  6 6 6 5 6 29  Total  14 11 11 11 13 60   The data captured through questionnaires were analyzed using the software applications i.e. SPSS and Microsoft Excel. Furthermore, triangulation was done to incorporate data gathered through interviews and documents in this analysis, which was again validated in the studied organizations. This has led to the output of this research work i.e. IT Governance practices, problems and consequences in the studied organizations from the public sector in Tanzania.

4. The state of IT Governance practices In this section the study findings are presented briefly.

First, the context of the IT Governance related practices are highlighted (Fig. 1), secondly, IT Governance mechanisms are covered (Fig. 2) and finally, a summary & discussion on the IT Governance practices is presented.

The context of IT Governance in the sector is as indicated in Fig.1, with quality of service and customer satisfaction, strategic alignment/partnership between IT  and business, and organizational performance on top, certainly due to the nature of the sector. Other contexts are inherent in the ministries? or agencies? specific roles such as the case of TRA with its vision to be a modernized tax administration; where well-governed IT seemed to be a key integrator for the efficient realization of higher revenue collection and PMO- RALG where IT is necessary for a good governance and efficient coordination and information management between LGAs, RSs and MDAs.

Moreover the IT Governance can be implemented using a combination of elements (Fig. 3) and the      Figure 3: TRA IS Steering Committee (ISSC)  practice found in the sector is described in terms of structures, processes and relational mechanisms [9].

4.1.   IT Governance Structures One of the main determinants for effective IT Governance is how the IT function is organized in an organization. Furthermore structures involve the organization and location of the IT function that clearly defines the roles and responsibilities of a diversity of IT/business committees [4]. In the survey we have done in the public sector in Tanzania, the organizations were found to be practising a number of them as are shown in each individual case.

4.1.1. TRA. The decision-making structure is organized around four core departments headed by Commissioners and seven support departments including IT, all headed by Directors.

At the top level it is managed by the Commissioner General (CG) under the supervision and control of Board of Directors. The IT department is at the same level as other departments, headed by the Director of ICT and reports to the CG. The head is also part of the executive management and attends the Board.

While there is no IT strategy committee, the IT function is supported by the IT steering committee called the Information Systems Steering Committee (ISSC). It meets quarterly and members are both from IT and Business departments (Fig. 3). Generally, it oversees the IS investment and specifically it provides strategic leadership for IS operations in the Authority.

Also the authority has several committees at project level to oversee the project activities. These also include IT and business people that increase the partnership and acceptability [26]. The committees at this level are chaired by the Commissioner or Director of the business department concerned. At the lower levels there are implementations and technical teams all comprising IT and business people. An example of the project committees is the Drivers? Licences System (DLS) committee that oversees the processing and issuing of drivers? licences in the country.

The IT structure indicated to be in place, among others, has increased greatly the strategic alignment between IT and business [19]. It has also reduced some duplication of the efforts and resources, and increased the awareness and ownership of IT enabled projects by taking onboard the business people which further increased the partnership and IT contribution to the organizational goals.

4.1.2. MSD. The decision making structure is organized in function of three core and two support directorates including IT, all headed by Directors. At  top level it is managed by Director General (DG) under supervision and control of a Board of Trustees. As indicated here, the IT Directorate is at the same level as other directorates. It is headed by Director of IS and reports to DG. Also the head is part of the executive management and attends the Board.

While there is neither IT strategy nor IT steering committees, IT functions are supported by several other committees. An example is the Information Security Committee that oversees security related policies and procedures, chaired by the Chief Internal Auditor with members from IT and Business departments. Others are project-based committees. For example at the moment there are Bar-Code and Integrated Logistic System (ILS) Projects committees.

Both of them oversee the relevant projects conceptualization and implementations, and are chaired by the directorates of the processes concerned and have proved useful.

4.1.3. PMO-RALG. The decision-making structure of the Ministry is organized around eight divisions including IT division, headed by a Director. At the top level the Ministry is led by the Minister and managed by the Permanent Secretary (PS). As indicated here, IT division is at the same level as other divisions. It is headed by the Director of MIS, who reports to the PS and who is also part of the executive management.

While there is no IT steering committee at the Ministry level, recently they have proposed the high level ICT Steering committee to cut across the ministries that are heavily interacting with the LGAs through IT applications indicated earlier, thus likely to      Figure 4:  Governance of ICT based Projects ? an example of HCMIS Project Committee, PO-PSM  minimize duplication of efforts while optimizing IT resources. Again IT function is supported by other committees like IT specialists Working Group (ITWG) that comprises of IT specialists from all 21 regional secretariats (RSs) in the country, and IT and business people from the ministry. It is mandated to develop standards and oversee their implementation in their respective areas. Observation shows that with these setups in place, governance is getting better and certainly duplication of efforts will slowly decrease especially if higher levels and business people in the ministry, RSs and LGAs continuously get feedback and kept engaged in the process [26].

4.1.4. PO-PSM. The decision-making structure of the Ministry is organized around seven divisions including MIS Division, all headed by Directors. At the top level the Ministry is led by the Minister and managed by the Principal Secretary. As hinted earlier, IT division is at the same level as other divisions in the organization and is headed by the Director of MIS that reports to the PS and is part of the executive management.

There is no IT steering committee; however, the decisions related to ICT are mostly handled in the executive and operational management meetings.

Normally, at major projects level, there are project committees, e.g. the case of HCMIS that has a committee chaired by the business department concerned, with IT and business people, and in this case going beyond a single ministry given its utility; HR (PO-PSM) and Payroll (MoFEA) issues (Fig. 4).

4.1.5. MoFEA. The decision-making structure is organized around ten divisions including IT services  division; some are headed by commissioners and others by directors. At top level, the Ministry is led by the Minister and managed by the PS. As indicated here, IT division is at the same level as other divisions in the ministry. It is headed by the Director of IT Services, reports to PS and is part of the executive management.

Currently, there is no IT steering committee; however, interestingly they have a Website Board that oversees content matters and have both chairman and secretariat from the business and memberships from IT and business. In this way this board seems to contribute to its state of the art including updated content [15].

4.2. IT Governance Processes Processes refer to the strategic IT decision-making and monitoring [2] and the practices are indicated below.

4.2.1. TRA. The authority has several processes in use including elements of ITIL, a framework for IT service management [20]. At the moment this is used for problems and incidents management to ensure best practices that serve better the IT users. Also, the authority has a project life cycle that uses PRINCE2, a worldwide known project management methodology [20]. This in combination with the earlier mentioned projects committees ensure success in the whole project life cycle from the request for pre-study, idea processing and validation, prioritizing up to development or acquisition and maintenance. If there is a problem at any stage of the project, it is likely to be captured earlier and mitigation prompted. It also provides consistency across the organization, thus reducing the learning curve.

Recently, the authority has also introduced the balanced scorecard [21] at corporate level and cascaded it down to departments including IT. This has increased the alignment between IT and business including improvement in the reporting mechanisms and track of the IT achievements back to business goals [10]. Continued improvement and enforcement will further increase compliance to ISO 9000 (quality management systems) being deployed and performance of IT in relation to business goals.

4.2.2. MSD. The department does not follow any internationally recognized best practices and does not have IT strategic plan; rather IT plans are embedded within the corporate strategic plan. Also there are practices such as the use of a performance-based yearly business plan that indicates objectives to meet each year, activities to achieve them and KPIs for monitoring and evaluation.

Also elements of ROI are applied in appraisal of IT investment whether it is a new project or an upgrade of  Chairman Director, Establish ment, PO-  PSM  Director, IT  Services, MoFEA  Director, HR  Developm ent, PO-  PSM  Director, Managem  ent Services, PO-PSM  Secretariat Director, MIS PO-  PSM  Director, Pension, MoFEA  Director, Governme nt Budget, MoFEA      the system. In additional SLA are used, mostly embedded in the contract, for acquiring and managing services by third parties. However, there are no such SLAs practices between IT and user departments.

4.2.3. PMO-RALG. The Ministry does not practice any international recognized standard or framework and does not have IT strategic plan; rather IT plans are embedded within the ministry strategic plan. However, they have developed a comprehensive IT Operational Plan for short- and medium-term periods based on previous MIS strategies and current ministry Strategic Plan. This Operational plan has Key Result Areas (KRAs) that are also linked to the targets of the ministry Strategic Plan. Some important aspects to note is that one of the KRAs is specifically on Information System Governance and these KRAs indicate clearly the activities and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

4.2.4. PO-PSM. It does not follow internationally known approaches and does not have IT strategic plan; rather IT plans are embedded in the overall ministry Strategic Plan. This strategic plan includes general KPIs also for IT. Apart from that, the Directorate has created Client charter as SLA with user departments.

Though recently introduced, it allows measuring and improving its performance on a short-term basis.

Moreover, best practices like SWOT analysis are used in preparing IT plans as part of the ministry strategic plan. These altogether make the process of decision-making and monitoring more consistent not only to the Ministry but also to the facilitated MDAs.

4.2.5. MoFEA. The Ministry does not follow any internationally recognized approach and doesn?t have an IT strategic plan. However, it has an IT plan embedded in the overall strategic plan with activities deployed and monitored accordingly. This is also tracked from the expenditure point of view, where Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) standardized across the government is used. This allows tracking to be done both from a strategic plan and expenditure point of view, and the link established.

4.3. IT Governance Relational Mechanisms Relational mechanisms are a catalyst for attaining and sustaining business-IT alignment, even when structures and processes are in place [4]. These mechanisms are important in the studied environment given the size of the organizations and nature of interaction required for a successful ICT integration in the corporate strategies and operations. Its practices are indicated below.

4.3.1. TRA. Both IT and business people seemed to be equally aware of practices related to shared  understanding of business/IT goals, shared learning and dialogue, informal meeting between business and IT management and cross-functional business/IT training. For example, several training opportunities exist for IT people in business issues, like tax administration and business people on IT. Meetings from strategic to operational levels are yet another opportunity bridging the training gap, e.g. using annual managers meetings to introduce new IT developments.

4.3.2. MSD. In this department, practices include understanding of business and IT goals; for example, no IT plans are formulated and/or implemented without consultation with the management and project-based committees. This ensures subsequent accountability in implementation and use in respective departments.

Others are informal meetings between Business and IT management for example to discuss business logic related issues during planning and implementation.

Furthermore, cross-functional business/IT training is also practiced in several themes such as customer care and effective use of infrastructure and applications.

4.3.3. PMO-RALG. Practices include shared understanding of business and IT goals, where major IT initiatives are presented and discussed in the management meetings that comprise Business and IT people. This also applies to plans and implementation done through benchmarked ministry strategic plans and IT operational plan. Others are shared learning and dialogue for example through workshops; informal meeting between Business and IT people for example during project initiation and implementation; and cross-functional business/IT training for example on leadership and supported information systems. These together with other mechanisms ensure alignment and accountability in IT enabled projects [26], resulting to higher IT contribution to achieve ministry goals.

4.3.4. PO-PSM. The survey found out that there was consistency of practices related to shared understanding of business and IT goals, learning and dialogue, informal meeting and cross-functional business and IT training. For example, several joint awareness and training sessions have been held on e- government and public service reforms. Also meetings span from executive and operational management types to the project-based and ad-hoc ones. These practices have assisted the Ministry to integrate IT to the current stage, which apparently has impact in the constantly improving public service delivery.

4.3.5. MoFEA. The majority were aware of the shared understanding of business and IT goals, informal meeting between Business and IT and cross-functional      business and IT training. The first two are for example practiced through management and project meetings, and strategic planning and budgeting processes. The last one is practiced in terms of joint awareness/training related to deployed IT and area of application. A good example is the case of IFMIS among IT and accountants where general knowledge in accounts and IT are provided, followed by the actual use or management of the system. Although the Ministry has a long way to go for effective IT Governance, the mechanisms in place have assisted the Ministry in ensuring that IT contributes to the organizational goals.

4.4. A Summary on IT Governance Practices The practice on IT Governance mechanisms across the public sector in the studied organizations spanning from structure, processes to relational mechanisms pointed out earlier in each individual case, are summarized (Table 2) and discussed in the perspective of the commonality or differences.

Table 2: Summary of IT governance structures, processes and relational mechanisms in the studied organizations  Practice Type Practices across studied organizations i) Structures Organizational structure of IT function  All are headed by directors, report directly to CEO and are part of the executive management and directors attend the board where it applies.

How is IT instituted in the organization  They are mostly centralized and in some cases with staff distributed to work directly in a user department or branch.

Committees There are no IT steering Committees with exception of one of them.

At the level of the major projects, generally there are committees established to oversee implementation.

Also in some organizations there are several other committees to handle cutting-across issues like security, change controls and website content.

ii) Processes Strategic IS Planning  Not directly applied. However, generally there are elements of its application in preparing corporate/IT strategic plans.

SWOT Analysis  Mostly applied across studied organizations in different magnitudes; lower in corporate strategic plans that include IT and highly in the IT strategic plan currently in one organization.

Balanced scorecard  Generally not applied. However one of the organizations started to practice it  from the corporate strategic plan down to departments and individuals.

ROI calculation and measurements  Not applied per se. However, major IT investment needs non-financial and some financial benefits justifications like the case of HCMIS project cited earlier.

COBIT or related IT Governance frameworks  Not applied. However, one organization has started implementing some aspects of ITIL and indirectly some areas of COBIT.

Service Level Agreements (SLAs)  Hardly applied internally. However, it is mostly applied for external service providers as part of the contracts.

Activity Based Costing/ Budgeting (ABC)  Applied in most of them based on Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), a government wide tool for planning activities, resources, and associated performance.

iii) Relational Mechanisms Shared understanding of business/IT goals  It is widely practiced mostly through normal management mechanisms like management meetings and special IT project/programmes-based committees.

Shared learning and dialogue  Somehow practiced through meetings, workshops and training on issues pertaining to business and IT in relation with IS development and use.

Informal meetings between business and IT management  It is widely practiced at different levels for example in clarifying some IT/Business issues especially when a new IT enabled project is being initiated or implemented.

Cross- functional business/IT training  It is widely practiced through workshop and training on matters of interest among IT and business people.

Performance/ Partnership rewards and incentives  It is not systematically practiced.

However, occasionally some people are rewarded due to outstanding performance on innovative solutions.

Cross- functional business/IT job rotation/ co-location  Not widely practiced. However, in one of the cases, co-location across the units and zones/branches has been applied.

"Virtual meeting" for business and IT people e.g.

Intranet use  Not practiced. Although there is already Intranet in many of these organizations, it has not been widely used due to cultural and enforcement issues.

Knowledge management  Not widely practiced in terms of having the knowledge base of general or specific areas.

The analysis of these mechanisms indicates that there are some strengths and weaknesses as far as the practices for each category, are concerned.  Generally the studied organizations indicate to have strength in supportive IT organization structure with exception of not having IT strategy and steering committees in most of them. The major weaknesses seem to be on the processes where best practices and standards like Strategic Information Systems Planning, IT Management/Governance & performance management frameworks are rarely applied and this could be detrimental to the consistency and enforcement in deployment, use and management of IT. Also while there is some strength in relational mechanisms practices like shared understanding of business/IT goals and Informal meetings between business and IT management across the studied environment, there are also weaknesses in many of these mechanisms including knowledge management, virtual meeting points and performance/partnership rewards and incentives. It is also worth to note that improvement on these practices is continuously being done, however not as a specific IT Governance project but rather as normal progress in governance of IT to further increase IT contribution to achieve corporate goals.

Looking at these results in the international context, we see that they are in contrast with related studies in the developed world, like is the case of six organizations in Belgium [9], which indicated that most of them had specific IT Governance projects and applied best practices and standards  like COBIT, ITIL, PRINCE2 and Balance Scorecard.

Taking into account the fact that one of the key determinants of the effective IT Governance in the organization, apart from constitution of IT structure, is where the IT decision-making authority is located in the organization [5]. Also taking into account the practices in place in relation to IT Governance key decisions in terms of who provides input on one hand and decides on the other, the findings across the studied organizations indicate that generally both are distributed across the organization as indicated in Fig.

5. Specifically, however, the notable pattern indicates that IT provides most of the inputs throughout the decisions except on the Business application needs where inputs are equally coming from business related groups. The decisions indicate a different trend as are mostly made by executive management comprising IT and Business people, which if done well is likely to increase alignment of IT and business and smooth implementation of IT applications and its use [26].

Looking at related studies elsewhere and taking the case of MIT-CISR work and specifically on the public sector [5], it is obvious that there are similarities in the pattern especially on decisions where federal dominates in both cases. However, differences appear  in decisions related to IT architecture and infrastructure, done by IT Monarchy while in our case it is done by the same Federal. Notably, when it comes to the input, the difference seems to be substantial due to the fact that while IT monarchy dominates most of the inputs in the compared studies, our related study environment indicates to be dominated by Federal.

Looking at the differences in both cases we can see that the mature IT Governance practices especially on structures might be one of the determinants of the differences and required governance effectiveness.

5. Discussion: Problems and consequences Use of ICT in the studied environment is still a relatively new culture and this has contributed to the problems encountered [7], [22]. These problems are discussed here based on the representative case studies seen earlier. Also this section indicates the consequences in order that the implications for not taking necessary actions are known, so that this could be taken as motivation for change or further research.

5.1. Problems As it was earlier indicated, one vital way of looking at IT Governance related problems in an organization is its key focus areas [10] also applied by other earlier studies [23]. These areas, i.e. strategic alignment, value delivery, risk management, resource management and  Figure 5: The IT Governance key decisions patterns in the studied organizations  1?5: No. Of  Cases Occurence      performance management, are also applied here to look into the problems as were embedded in the questionnaires used in the survey. These problems are ranked according to the interviewees? perspective on their seriousness in the sector (Table 3) and respective discussion is done as per IT Governance focus areas.

Also the highlight is provided taking into account the summary and discussion on the current practices unveiled in the earlier section.

5.1.1. Strategic Alignment. This focuses on ensuring the linkage of business and IT plans; defining, maintaining and validating the IT value proposition; and aligning IT operations with enterprise operations [10]. Looking across the studied organizations it is clear that there is no specific IT strategic plan in most of them that could tie the business and IT activities more holistically and effectively. This, among others, leads to the biggest problem, i.e. lack of ownership by business people in IT-enabled projects (Table 3) and in some cases organizations being forced to allocate IT personnel to do what business people should be doing, rather than supporting them.

The aspect of inadequate or absent ICT policies and procedures is another problem that is also consistent across most of them. It hampers consistency in ICT usage and management, which is yet another serious problem. Lack of IT Governance awareness and certainly some guidelines are also seen as problem.

This is also linked with HR related problems on lack of clear roles, responsibilities and accountability that sometimes, among others, leads to the ad-hoc practices. While it appears that there are mechanisms to communicate ICT plans and goals e.g. through meetings and workshops, inadequate enforcement mechanisms still hamper the widespread use of ICT and promised benefits. An example is Intranet which seems to be in place in many organizations and can increase IT/Business partnership [26] and internal efficiency but it is still not being used widely enough.

5.1.2. Value delivery is one of the IT Governance outcomes and is about value proposition throughout the delivery cycle, ensuring that IT delivers the promised benefits against the strategy or plans [10]. In this regard it was found out that despite the high cost of IT there is still lower return or business value. This happens due to the mentioned earlier non-optimal use, missing synergies, and inadequate facilitation and enforcement for a widespread use. One of the interviewees claimed that some offices were still using computers merely as fast typewriters.

5.1.3. Risk Management. Risk management requires awareness by senior and operational officers and embedding of risk management responsibilities in the  Table 3: Ranked problems seriousness as per survey in the studied organizations      organization [10]. The survey indicates that generally there is still a weak risk-based approach in designing and operating IT related services which is also consistent with earlier studies on IT security matters in the environment [8].  However, for the very critical and country wide systems like Integrated Financial MIS (IFMIS) that manages all government expenditures, risk management is relatively higher and sometimes exaggerated. The latter is due to the fact that it has a separate physical network within the ministry concerned and across some government offices.

5.1.4. Resource Management which ensures optimal investment and the proper management of critical IT resources [10] is yet another problematic area in the sector. The issue of attracting and sustaining skilled and competent IT personnel is still a nightmare to solve, despite some efforts continually made.

Availability of essential budget for the required IT resources is yet another problem especially for low level staff, in regions and branches. Together with these is the case of fragmented IT initiatives with duplication of efforts and a loss of synergies and exploitation of the economies of scale. For example, one could find heavy duty printers or photocopiers with capacity to serve many employees or offices only serving a single person or office, thus mostly staying idle. Moreover, there are still some fragmented business applications in the studied organizations.

5.1.5. Performance Management that is important for tracking and monitoring strategy and plans implementation and benefits accrued and measured beyond the conventional accounting [9], is yet another problematic area. Although there is progress in this direction like the recently use of the balanced scorecard in one of the organizations or metrics embedded in the ministerial strategic plans, the environment generally poses some weaknesses. This again came out strongly in the survey (Table 3).

Others include inadequate follow-up and enforcement on the matters discussed in the IT related committees and meetings. This also indicates that putting IT structures in place is not enough; one should go beyond to implement necessary processes and relational mechanisms to ensure the returns on investment [26].

As indicated earlier, Table 3 presents the ranked problems in the public sector. These results are also comparable to other related studies like those produced by the IT Governance Institute [24], [25] and the MIT- CISR study on 256 organizations worldwide [5]. While there are differences among them like lack of ownership of IT projects, relatively lower acceptance of new IT applications, fragmented IT initiatives and inadequate enforcement mechanisms that hamper the optimal use of the IT resources, there are also  similarities. These include staff matters but in this case going further to the staff shortage and inadequate IT skills and competency. Others are weak measurement of IT performance and value to the business, high cost of IT but low ROI and security issues.

5.2. Consequences Several studies have indicated possible consequences for not having effective IT Governance in place, in the cases related to public sector in a developing country [5], [22]. Based on these cases and a preliminary survey in the public sector, possible consequences were investigated and bundled together as shown in Fig. 6. According to the study results there are serious consequences in the sector that can be detrimental to the effort towards effective IT Governance, and hence improvement in the public service delivery. The most serious problem noted is the difficulty involved in holding individuals accountable for their results.

Others are ad-hoc solutions due to user and management frustrations, which are obviously outcomes of not having a good IT governance in place, where people finds their own solutions, and sometimes take this loophole to misuse the IT resources.

Figure 6: Ranked consequences as a result of the survey in the studied organizations       Additionally, there are traditional consequences like IT investment losses, and given the magnitude of systems put in place in these kinds of organizations, they encounter the loss of a lot of money and effort when a project fails to deliver its promises.

Similarly, there are reputation damages which are also a nasty consequence to such large organizations; for example, at a revenue authority if the system that deals with customs clearance or tax payments have some problems and there is no adequate governance that ensures the timely recovery or alternative solution, this will be in the news the following day. Knowing the problems and associated consequences will assist the IT decision makers in prioritizing activities and solutions for effective IT governance and consequently the improvement in the public service delivery.

6. Conclusions In this paper, based on the analysis of five public organizations, we have described IT Governance current practices, problems encountered and the consequences in the public sector in a developing country. The IT Governance mechanisms, together with key focus and decision areas provided the means for a thorough investigation into the studied environment. The combination of these approaches was found to be useful in uncovering practices of interest in this environment, where on one hand IT resources are scarce and its development and management are relatively less established and on the other hand the use of ICT in providing public services is gaining momentum and several efforts are being made to carry it out successfully. The analysis of IT Governance practices in the studied organizations indicate diverse practices in relation to structures, processes and relational mechanisms with notable weakness in the processes where, in contrast with developed world, best practices are rarely applied in most of them.

It was also noted that improvement on these practices are being done continually, not as a specific IT Governance project but rather as normal improvement to increase the IT contribution to the organizational goals. The analysis revealed a number of problems and their consequences in the organizations. The problems we found are categorized in the IT Governance key focus areas, and are including the lack of a specific IT strategic plan in most of them; lack of business people ownership in IT- enabled projects; inadequate or absent ICT policies and procedures; lack of IT Governance awareness and guidelines; inadequate follow-up and enforcement mechanisms; and lack of clear roles, responsibilities and accountability. Others problems found are a weak risk-based approach in designing and operating IT  related services; attracting and sustaining skilled and competent IT personnel; inadequate budget for required IT resources; fragmented IT initiatives with a loss of synergies and exploitation of the economies of scale; high cost of IT with lower business value; and weak measures of IT performance and value to business.

In addition, to the problems and challenges in the public sector, several consequences that can be detrimental to the efforts towards effective IT Governance and hence improvements in the public service delivery were also revealed. The most common ones include the difficulty of holding individuals accountable for their results; ad-hoc solutions due to user and management frustrations; and traditional consequences like IT investment losses and damage to the reputation of the organization in question.
