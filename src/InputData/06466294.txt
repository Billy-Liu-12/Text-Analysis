Application of Association Rule Mining: A Case  Study on Team India

Abstract? This paper applies Association Rule Mining algorithm to sports management, especially mining relationship from data on performance of Indian cricket team in one day international (ODI) matches. This analysis will help in determining factors associated with the match outcome so as to enable the team to formulate match winning strategies. Data has been obtained from secondary sources to obtain deeper insights on playing conditions and the match outcome. The association among factors such as outcome of toss, playing in a home ground or playing abroad, batting first or batting second, and the match outcome, i.e., win or loss is examined. The outcome of the analysis reveals that Team India has performed well in the last ten years (since 2001 to 2010) as compared to entire period since the team started playing its first match (since 1974 to 2010).

I.  INTRODUCTION Association rule mining (ARM) algorithms are used to  extract associations among a large set of items or events. ARM is increasingly used in retail to determine customer buying behaviours through the data obtained from the stores? transactional databases, and is called Market Basket Analysis [3]. ARM technique has been successfully applied in a variety of fields such as marketing, finance, telecommunication, etc.

This paper discusses the application of ARM in sports, especially in cricket. In this paper, the activities in cricket, such as result of toss, setting a target or chasing a target, home venue or away venue are considered similar to examining the transaction data in retail industry.  Further, an attempt has been made to investigate the association of different activities in a match on the outcome of a match. Interesting results are obtained based on the analysis are discussed.



II. LITERATURE REVIEW Association rule mining looks for frequently occurring  patterns in the data and is often used for market basket analysis. Reference [1] introduced the concept of mining association rules and an approach called apriori algorithm to discover interesting relationship between items in the large database. Most of the previous studies have proposed different  mining algorithm which is similar to or modified version of apriori algorithm [2] [10] [12] [11] [8]. Some of the widely used mining algorithms are apriori algorithm, tree projection algorithm and FP growth algorithm [1] [9]. Since mining association rules in large database is computation intensive, researchers attempt to reduce the computation effort by extracting rules from sampled data taken from the large databases. Some of the sampling methods proposed in the past are simple random sampling, finding associations from sampled transactions (FAST), and epsilon approximation sample enabled (EASE) [13] [5] [4].

Mining association rules finds its application in domains such as retail, bio-informatics, insurance, judicial document classification and banking [3]. Though operations research techniques and data mining algorithms are applied in sports activities, but the use of ARM techniques to draw patterns is very limited [15] [7]. Hence an attempt has been made in this study to mine association rules from the cricket match records.



III. METHODOLOGY Given two product items, X and Y, ARM in the form of an  association rule X|Y, indicates a purchase pattern that if a customer purchases X then he or she also purchases Y. Two measures, support and confidence, are commonly used to select the association rules. This paper analyzes the association of outcome of the match with opponent team e.g., Australia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, type of venue (home ground, opponent ground or neutral venue), inning order (setting the target, chasing the target) and outcome of the toss. In essence, the paper attempts to investigate the factors which may be associated with the match outcome, except the team composition. Team composition is a known but complex factor, and hence, it is not included in the study.



IV. DATA DESCRIPTION Data was collected from the cricinfo website on the  matches played by India against all the other test playing nations from 1974 till now [6]. Two data sets are considered for this study, which are as follows.

Dataset 1: All ODI matches played by team India till 05- June-2010.

Dataset 2: ODI matched played by India during the last ten years (since 25-March-2001 to 05-June-2010).

Dataset 2 is a sub-set of dataset 1. The rationale behind using two data sets is that the recent data may be a better predictor of performance.



V. VARIABLES USED IN THE STUDY In this research, the association between factors  representing playing conditions and the match outcome are examined. A description of the various playing conditions included in the study is discussed in the subsequent sections below.

A. Toss Outcome The outcome of toss is an important factor in a cricket  match, because it decides whether the team will field first or bat first; thereby the toss outcome will impact the outcome of a match. E.g. seaming condition in the morning will help the bowlers as the seaming balls will pose difficulty for the batsmen, dew in the evening or under the lights will be a challenging factor to the spinners and fielders as it will be difficult to grip the wet ball.

B. Venue The nature of the venue is considered to analyze the  performance of team India in home ground, opponent ground, and neutral venue. Usually, the home team performs well in its home ground as the team is aware of local conditions and the nature of the pitch, whereas the when the team plays in alien conditions it is difficult for the visiting team to get accustomed to the alien conditions including weather, humidity, and pitch conditions. For the purpose of analysis, the playing conditions based on the venue are considered as home condition and away from home (which includes opponent field and neutral venue).

C. Innings Order The innings order is considered to analyze the performance  of team India in pressure situation. It is a general notion that chasing the target (batting second) is more stressful than to set a target in a match.

D. Match Outcome The possible outcomes for a match are winning the match,  losing the match, tied result, and no result as the match is abandoned. We have eliminated the matches with no results or tied results and considered only the match outcome with either winning the game or losing the game.



VI. ANALYSIS AND RESULTS Data is analyzed using Weka version 3.6.3 software. The  support for the analysis is varied from 1.0 to 0.1 and the Confidence for the analysis is set at 0.5. The analysis has resulted in some interesting results, contradicting the general notion about Indian cricket team. The results of the analysis  against each test playing nations considering Dataset 1 is presented in Table 1. The results of the analysis against each test playing nations considering Dataset 2 (i.e. data for the last ten years) is presented in Table 2.

It is widespread opinion that India wins more matches at home than overseas, but this analysis shows that the performance of team India against Australia is dismal. The toss outcome, innings order and venue does not have any impact on the performance of team India against Australia. This finding clearly shows the superiority of Australia over team India.

Further, Australia is one of the top ranked teams in world cricket for a long period of time.

On the contrary, the performance of team India is commendable against Bangladesh. The toss outcome, innings order and venue has not impacted the outcome of the match.

Team India has demonstrated its superiority over Bangladesh.

Team India has performed well against England at home as well as away from home, except when team India bats first in both conditions, or wins toss in away conditions.

Team India performance against New Zealand is better at home than while playing away. However, it is interesting to note that Team India?s chance of winning against New Zealand is around 56% when Team India chases the target even in away condition, whereas the chance of Team India winning against reduces to 50% if team India wins toss in away condition.

The performance of Team India against Pakistan is not encouraging at home and away conditions. The chance of Team India winning while chasing the target against Pakistan is 58% when playing away from home. Team India?s performance against South Africa is better in home condition than in away condition. India wins against South Africa at     home but loses most of the time while playing away from home with a relatively high level of confidence.

The performance of team India is commendable against Sri Lanka. The toss outcome, innings order and venue has not impacted the performance of team India against. One of the interesting associations that came out of this study is the performance of West Indies cricket team against team India.

Team India?s chance of winning against West Indies is 72% when team India wins the toss and bats first, whereas other rules conclude that team India will lose against West Indies in all other conditions.

The performance of team India is commendable against Zimbabwe. Team India record against Zimbabwe is poor only when Team India loses toss and bats first in away condition, whereas Team India has demonstrated their superiority over Zimbabwe in all other scenarios.

Team India has lost to Australia irrespective of playing conditions. See Table 2 for details. The performance of Team India against Bangladesh and England has been laudable. Further, India tends to win against New Zealand while chasing a target. It is also surprising that Team India wins against Pakistan while playing away from home.

For Team India to win against West Indies, winning the toss seems to be crucial.

A comparison between the two data sets shows that India?s chance of winning against Australia has dropped considerably over time; the confidence with which India loses has increased while the outcome does not depend on the pitch or innings order. When India plays against Bangladesh, the outcome of  the match has not changed much over the last ten years. As seen in Table 1, when India plays against South Africa at home, the outcome of the match did not depend on toss outcome or the innings order but in recent times (see Table 2), winning the toss favorably impacts the match outcome.

Against England, it is interesting to find the Team India?s record of chasing is more promising in away condition if Team India has lost the toss, whereas it is otherwise, even in the last ten years. In home conditions, if team India bats first, then the chance of team India losing the match against England is 86%.

The outcome of India vs. Sri Lanka matches has remained almost unchanged over time though confidence of both winning and losing increased. When India faces West Indies as opponents, winning the toss is very crucial, both while playing at home and away. Team India?s performance against West Indies has improved in the last ten years.

In the last ten years, India has won more matches even while playing away from home than the overall scenario and the confidence of winning matches has also increased. ?The present team, under the leadership of the Mahendra Singh Dhoni since 2007, has a national record for most number of One Day International (ODI) wins including nine straight wins and has become one of the strongest cricket teams in ODI cricket matches? [15].  Further, it is observed that winning the toss matters at home as well as away from home except against New Zealand and Pakistan. Innings order has not impacted the outcome of the matches as compared to the whole set of data.

In essence, India has adapted itself to the changing conditions outside the country, in the last ten years. Indian cricket team has won 152 matches out of 285 matches with a winning percentage of around 55%.



VII. CONCLUSIONS This article has discussed the application of ARM in sports  management, especially, in cricket. The impact of the toss outcome, ground conditions and innings order on of the outcome of the match has been examined. The difference in the outcome between the entire data set and the recent data (last ten years) has also been discussed. Some of interesting the results are:  ? It is a notion that Indian cricket team is unbeatable in home conditions, but the analysis shows that the teams from Australian, Pakistan and West Indies cricket team have done exceptionally well against Team India in Indian conditions.

? Overall, the performance of Indian cricket team in the last ten years is encouraging. Even in foreign condition, Indian cricket team has improved its performance over the past ten year though Indian cricket team is termed as ?poor travelers?. Indian cricket team has won around 101 ODI matches played in foreign countries out of 177 ODI matches, whereas Indian cricket team has won 51 ODI matches out of 92 ODI matches played in home conditions.

These results have important implications for Team India?s managers and the captain, especially while deciding on playing strategies, e.g., batting or chasing, etc. The current research,     being the first of its kind to apply ARM to cricket, has its limitations. Firstly, this article has not considered the direct impact of team composition on the match outcome as it has varied much over the time horizon in which the data has been collected. Further, only the matches played by Team India are considered. In future, matches played by other teams could be analyzed to get deeper insights on the game of cricket.

Furthermore, analyzing the newer format of the game, i.e., T20 may also provide more understanding on the playing conditions and thereby the match outcome.

Note: The terms Indian cricket team and Team India have been used interchangeably.
