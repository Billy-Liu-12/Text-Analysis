INTRODUCTION  In data mining approach, association rules mmmg  algorithms are promising for actual applications such as  marketing problems. Recently, it has been applied also to the  other fields such as biological knowledge extraction. However,  the association rules mining is essentially based on Boolean  attributes constitution in database. In order to apply the mining  algorithm to further various problems, the quantitative  attributes should also be appropriately dealt with as well as the  Boolean attributes. Especially in manufacturing area,  quantitative attributes such as states of a process, conditions of  manufacturing, and measured quality of products, are  necessary for quality control[8], manufacturing management,  planning, and decision of management strategy. In order to  deal with the quantitative attributes in mining association rules,  algorithms based on the generalized association rules that  handle the continuous attributes as the Boolean vector by  partitioning into several intervals are proposed[1 ][2]. Though  several methods were also proposed to improve the  computational efficiency and utility[ 11], the process  performed by the algorithms was still time consuming and    complicated to the user. Fuzzy association rules mining  approaches are proposed to overcome such disadvantages  based on the fuzzy set concept[3-6,1 0, 11]. These approaches  are based on fuzzy extensions of the classical association rules  mining by defining support and confidence of the fuzzy rule.

978-1-4244-8314-3110/$26.00 2010 IEEE 68  The fuzzy association rules mining has a good property in  terms of quantization of numerical attributes in database  compared with Boolean quantized generalized association  rules mining[12,13]. Though the mining results of fuzzy  association rules are easy to understand for corresponding  human operators, two drawbacks are still remained for  applying such fuzzy approaches to the actual problems. One is  the computational time for mining from database, and the  other is huge redundant rules extraction as the result of mining.

The issue of computational efficiency is critical for fuzzy  association rules mining compared with traditional Boolean  rules mining, as the number of fuzzy items for mining  increases for quantization of numerical attributes.

In order to deal with such computational efficiency, a  memory based approach is proposed and shows significance  of the performance[14]. However, the method occupies the  necessary internal computer resource, i.e. memory, for mining  calculation. In the another point of view, a mining method that  extracts association rules with multiple minimal support  thresholds of items in database[15]. Though the method is also  necessary for actual applications, the decision problem of the  importance of each item realized as minimal support is still  remained as an indispensable issue.

In this paper, we discuss an improvement of algorithm for  extracting fuzzy association rules from database. The objective  of the algorithm is to improve the computational efficiency of  data mining and to reduce the redundant rules extracted for the  actual application. Firstly, we define redundancy of fuzzy  association rules inspired by [16]. We also prove essential  theorems concerning with redundancy of fuzzy association  rules. Secondly, we propose a basic algorithm based on the  Apriori algorithm for rule extraction considering redundancy of  rules. The basic idea is to calculate the confidence of the rule  and the redundancy in the extraction process, instead of final  calculation of the confidence in conventional methods.

Utilizing the confidence and the redundancy of the rule,    candidate itemsets generation can be restrained by the proposed  algorithm. Through numerical experiments using UCI  benchmark data(abalone)[7], the performance of the proposed  algorithm is demonstrated.

The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, extraction  technique of fuzzy association rules is introduced. In section 3,  basic concepts of redundancy of fuzzy association rules are  described. The algorithm to improve the computational  efficiency based on the redundancy is proposed in section 4. In  section 5, results of numerical examples to confirm the  proposed algorithm are shown. Finally, conclusions are drawn  in section 6.



II. EXTRACTION OF Fuzzy ASSOCIATION RULES  A. Fuzzy Association Rules  Fuzzy association rules are extension of Boolean  association rules based on quantization using fuzzy sets. Fuzzy  association rules extraction is performed as the following steps.

Let F = {P,Q,T} denotes the fuzzy itemset which consists of  fuzzy sets in different attribute, where P, Q, and T denote the  fuzzy sets. Support of the itemset F is defmed as:  s(F) = L,uF(Xp)  m  (1)  where x p denotes the transaction of the database, J1 F (x P )  denotes the membership value calculated by the product  operation (t-norm) of each item(Fuzzy Set) in F, and m  denotes the total number of transactions in the database. It is  obvious that the definition is equivalent to the wel1-known  "Boolean mining problem" when the item sets consist of "crisp  sets." From the support value, confidence of the fuzzy  association rule G ? H is calculated by:  c(G ? H)= s(GuH)js(G) (2)  where G and H are fuzzy item sets. The fuzzy association rule is  extracted when these values of the rule are more than pre  defmed minimal support and pre-defmed minimal confidence.

When we apply the mining algorithm to the actual huge  problems, the support calculation is critical calculation  concerning the number of queries to the database. The item set  which has the value greater than predefined threshold is called  "frequent itemset." One of the main problems of mining fuzzy  association rules is how efficiently fmd the "frequent itemsets"  from the database.

B. The Apriori Algorithm  The Apriori algorithm is an essential and effective method  for finding the frequent itemsets. The basic idea is that the  frequent itemset should contain the subsets of frequent  itemsets. Owing to this characteristic, frequent itemsets can be  compounded from the smaller frequent itemsets one after  another. Let k-itemset denote an itemset having k items. Let Lk  represent the set of frequent k-itemsets, and Ck the set of  candidate k-itemsets. The algorithm to generate the frequent  item sets is as fol1ows:  AI) Ck is generated by joining the item sets in Lkl  A2) The itemsets in Ck which have some (k-l)-subset that  is not in Lk_1 are deleted.

A3) The support of itemsets in Ck is calculated through  database scan to decide Lk.

It should be noted that the plural fuzzy sets defined in the  same attribute cannot be included together in the same item set.

After LI is decided first through database scan, the above Al  A3 procedures are iterated until Lk becomes empty set. The  association rules are extracted by combining the decided  frequent item sets to calculate the confidence of the association  rule by Eq.(2). Finally, the association rules that have values  more than pre-defined minimal confidence are decided.



III. REDUNDANCY OF THE RULE  First we need an appropriate measure of redundancy of  extracted rules. In this study, we deal with the redundancy  based on the certainty factor[10,1l,16]. The certainty factor is  an important and popular used measure of belief to inference  rules since MYCIN era. The certainty factor(CF) of the  rule A ? C is defined as follows:  CF(A ? C) =  Conf(A ? C) -supp(C)  l-supp(C)  ; if Conf(A ? C supp(C)  CF(A ? C) =  Conf(A ? C) -supp(C)  supp(C)  ; if Conf(A ? C)s, supp(C)  CF(A ?C) =1 ; if supp(C) = 1  CF(A ? C) = -1 ; if supp(C) = 0 (1)  In this study, we defme redundancy of fuzzy association    rules inspired by the conventional studies[16,17]. Whereas Xu  et. al proved the redundancy of rules having different  conclusion parts, we assume that the conclusion part of rules is  identical for redundancy theorem from the viewpoint of  application in this study.

Theorem 1: Let X ? Y and X' ? Y be two fuzzy  association rules.

If Conf(X ? Y) ? Conf(X' ? Y)  then CF(X ? Y) ? CF(X' ? Y)  Proof Assume that S = CF (X ? Y) -CF (X' ? Y) .

1) Assuming that Conf(X'? Y) > supp(Y) . Because  Conf(X ? Y) ? Conf(X' ? Y) we have  Conf(X ? Y) > supp(Y) .

s = Con/(X ? Y)-supp(Y) _ COn/(X'? Y)-supp(Y)  1 -supp(Y) 1 -supp(Y)  = Con/(X ? Y)-Con/(X'? Y) ? 0  I-supp(Y)  2) Assuming that Conf(X' ? Y) s, supp(Y) . In this  situation, we have two cases.

(i) Conf(X ? Y) s, supp(Y)  In this case,  s = Conf(X ? Y)-supp(Y) _ Conf(X'? Y)-supp(Y)  supp(Y) supp(Y)  = Conf(X ? Y)-Conf(X'? Y)  :2:   supp(Y)  (ii) Con/(X ? Y) > supp(Y)  In this case,  s = Conf(X ? Y)-supp(Y) Conf(X'? Y)-supp(Y)  1 -supp(Y) supp(Y)  = Conf(X ? Y)-supp(Y) + supp(y)-Conf(X'? Y) :2:   1-supp(Y) supp(Y)  3) In special cases of supp(Y) =1 or supp(Y)=O, the inequality  is obviously hold.

Theorem 2: Let A ? Y, B ? Y and A,B ? Y be three  fuzzy association rules, where A, B and Yare fuzzy itemsets.

If max(Conf(A ? y), Conf(B ? Y)):2: Conf(A, B ? Y) ,  then max(CF(A ? Y),CF(B ? Y)):2: CF(A,B ? Y).

Proof  1) Assuming that min(Conf(A ? Y), Conf(B ? V))    ;:0: Conf(A, B ? y), we have  max(CF(A ? V), CF(B ? y));:O: min(CF(A ? y), CF(B ? V))  :2: CF(A,B? Y) from Theorem 1.

2) Assuming that min(Conf(A ? Y),Conf(B ? V))  < Conf(A, B ? y) , we have Conf(A, B ? y) :0:; Conf(A ? y)  or Conf(A, B ? Y) :O:; Conf(B ? Y) . From theorem 1,  max(CF(A ? Y),CF(B ? Y)):2: CF(A,B ? Y).

We can extend the Theorem 2 to the general condition.

Theorem 3: Let X ? Y be a fuzzy association rule, where X  and Yare fuzzy item sets. Let Q be Q = 2 x - X -  , where  2x is the power set of X and  is the empty set.

Conceptual Diagram of Redundancy of the Rules  Definition 1: Let X ? Y be a fuzzy association rule, where X  and Yare fuzzy itemsets. Let Q be Q = 2 x - X -  , where  2x is the power set of X and  is the empty set.

If max{Conf(Z ? y));:o: Conf(X ? Y) , then we call the rule  ZEQ  X ? Y redundant rule.

If max{Conf(Z ? Y)) < Conf(X ? Y) , then we call the rule  ZEQ  X ? Y non-redundant rule.

The redundant rule has never maximum value of CF among  the subset fuzzy association rules. On the contrary, the non  redundant rule has maximum value of CF among the subset  fuzzy association rules from Theorem 3. Fig.l shows the  conceptual diagram of the redundant rule and the non  redundant rule.

The objective of association rules mining becomes to find  the fuzzy association rules that are non-redundant and satisfY  traditional confidence and support conditions. Clearly we can  calculate the redundancy and prune the redundant rules after    mining procedures. Our motivation in this study is to utilize the  redundancy for extracting algorithm of fuzzy association rules.



IV. IMPROVEMENT OF APRIORI ALGORITHM BASED ON  If max{Conf(Z ? y));:O: Conf(X ? y) , then REDUNDANCY OF THE RULE ZEQ  max{CF(Z ? y));:O: CF(X ? y).

ZEQ  Proof From the assumption, there exist P E Q that satisfY  Con/(P ? y);:O: Con/(X ? Y) . From Theorem 1, CF(P ? y)  ;:0: CF(X ? Y). Hence,  CF(X ? y):O:; CF(P ? Y) :O:; max{CF(Z ? V))  ZEQ   The necessary point in the Apriori algorithm for extracting  association rules is to generate the frequent item sets efficiently.

Though the confidence of the association rules are calculated  [mally after all decision of frequent itemsets in traditional  Apriori algorithm, the basic idea of our proposal is that the  confidence of the rule can be calculated after each step A3 in  the Apriori algorithm and used for pruning the redundant  itemsets. The issue is to decide which itemset should be pruned  utilizing the confidence information. Then we define "strong  redundant rule" and "strong redundant itemset".

Confidence  1.0  2 3 4 The number of  items  Figure 2. Conceptual Diagram of Pruning Method  Definition 2: Let X ? Y be a fuzzy association rule, where X  and Yare fuzzy item sets. Let Q be Q = 2 x - X -  .

If min(ConJ(Z ?Y)?ConJ(X ?Y) , then we call the rule  ZEQ  X ? Y strong redundant rule.

Let k-rule denote the rule that has k attributes(items) including  consequent part, and the "subset rule" denote that itemset  corresponding to the rule is subset of the item set of larger rule  and the consequent parts of both rules are the same set.

Definition 3: Let Z be a fuzzy itemset that has k items( k>2 ).

When all the k-rules generated from Z are strong redundant, we  call the itemset Z strong redundant itemset.

Fig.2 shows the concept of strong redundant rule and strong  redundant itemset. Since the Apriori algorithm generates the  candidate itemsets in tum from l-itemsets, the pruning based    on the redundancy should be performed simultaneously.

In addition to the basic Apriori algorithm, the following  procedures are employed for k> I as:  A4) The association rules are decided by calculating the  confidence of k-rule based on Lk and Lk.j  AS) The strong redundant k-itemsets in Lk are deleted.

The concept of the procedure is that the confidence value of  rule should increase by increasing the number of antecedent  items. In other words, the procedure is based on valid heuristics  that the combination of items in antecedent part which  deteriorates the confidence value will become redundant in the  following iterations. We can expect reduction of computational  time and redundant rules pruning by the additional procedures.

It should be noted that the confidence calculation in each  iteration does not lead to the increase of overall calculation  time in association rules mining.

v. NUMERICAL EXAMPLES  We develop the fuzzy mining system based on the  redundancy pruning and evaluate the proposed algorithms  through numerical examples. We apply the system to "abalone  data" available from the vcr Machine Learning Repository[7].

The abalone data set consists of 4177 measured data with 1  nominal attribute and 8 continuous attributes as shown in   Table. I. In the experiments, the nominal attribute is  transformed to the continuous attribute. Table 2(a) shows the  statistics and the fuzzy partition information of attributes are  summarized in Table 2(b). The range of fuzzy partition is set  wider than the actual data distribution for performance  evaluation. The fuzzy partition example is shown in Fig.3. We  use two types of fuzzy sets with different width, i.e. triangle  type and trapezoid type. Although it is better to use the factor  such as "interesting" for pruning the derived rules in addition,  we apply the native association rule extraction for proposed  algorithm evaluation. The minimal support is set as 0.2.

Fig.6 shows the number of extracted  rules by the conventional Apriori algorithm. Many redundant  rules are extracted as well as the necessary non-redundant rules.

Our issue is to restrain the extraction of redundant rules. Fig.7  shows the results of the number of deleted rules by the  proposed algorithm. Some redundant rules are deleted  simultaneously along with frequent itemsets extraction.

However, since a few non-redundant rules are also  unexpectedly deleted at the lower threshold value of minimal  confidence, we have to investigate further about heuristics, i.e.

strong redundant itemsts and relation of threshold values. It  should be noted that the number of deleted rules has less  dependence on the minimal confidence.

These results are promising in terms of computational time  and redundant rules pruning. However, the improvement is  limited in terms of computational time. We consider that the  performance of the proposed method must be improved by  applying the output field specification method[17]. We expect  that the number of pruned rules becomes larger based on the  specifications. Moreover, the other measures to prevent  redundant rules extraction in fuzzy association rules mining    could be applied as well as the proposed algorithm .



VI. CONCLUSION  In this paper, we proposed a basic algorithm based on the  Apriori algorithm for rule extraction utilizing redundancy of  the extracted rules, in order to improve the efficiency of the  association rules mining and to prune the redundant rules  extracted. We also proved the redundancy defmition of the rule  based on the CF(certainty factor). The performance of the  algorithm was evaluated through numerical experiments using  benchmark data, "Abalone". From the results, the method was  found to be promising in terms of computational time and  redundant rule pruning. Our future plan includes sophistication  of the proposed algorithm, application to the huge data mining  problem, and further improvement of fuzzy association rules  mining.
