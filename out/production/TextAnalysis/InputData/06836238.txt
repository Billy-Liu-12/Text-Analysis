Improving CubeSat Downlink Capacity with Active Phased Array Antennas

Abstract?Power budgets on small satellites are restricted by the limited surface area for solar panels. This limits the power avail- able for radio communications, which constrains the downlink budget. The limited transmit power translates to low downlink data rates on small satellites. Antenna gain from directive an- tennas may be a power efficient way of improving the downlink budget, thereby increasing the downlink rate of small satellites.

We have developed a prototype low-power, electrically-steered S-band phased array RF front-end suitable for a CubeSat that could efficiently increase the EIRP, permitting higher data rates.

A prototype of the array has been constructed and tested in an anechoic chamber. The four element array provides a minimum gain of 2.5 dB and average gain of 5 dB compared to a single patch antenna element with a 5 W power envelope across a range of up to 60 degrees from broadside of the array. Given the 100 mW overhead of each phased array element, the design is expected to scale to a 16 element array, which could fit on two 20 cm by 10 cm deployable panels on a 2U CubeSat. With a 10 watt average power budget for the transmitter, such an array would provide an estimated gain of 11 dB compared to a single omnidirectional antenna.
