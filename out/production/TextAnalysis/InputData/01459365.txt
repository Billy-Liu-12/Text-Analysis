Abstract This paper studies the d - e t  passive location and hacking problem of multiple passive sensors.

Since bearingonly locaticm of mullisensor will produce a  lot of false intersection points in dense envirorqnents. In order to dintinate these false intersection points correctly  and quickly, two-Ievd bearing measurement association algorithm is propcsed in this paper. This method firstly uses a ruie to elinhate some false intersection points, so the computation burden is decreased. Then, the ?um  likelihood algorithm is used to associate the bearing  measurements, which can ensure the true association rate is high Simulation is also made, and the results reveal the feasibility and validity of the bearing measurements  association algorithm presented in this paper, and multiple tar5ts can be located and tracked at the same time by passive sensors.

1 hh-oduction  Passive location systems have the advafitage of high concealment and can get a lot of properties of targets. When using passive location methods to track targets, the existence and anti-interference capability of the passive location systems can be improved [ 1 1. Compared with active radar, passive location system possess the potential capability of detect stealth air vehcle, low altitude target and anti radar missile. Now passive radars have drawn increasing interest in military applications, and many people pay much more attention to passive location techmque now [2,3].

When target positions are estimated by bearing only measurements of a single moving platform, the estimation problem is hi&ly nonlinear and in certain conditions the range is not even ?observable? [4,5]. Now using several sites to locate targets seems to be a highly adopted approach[6,7]. In the absence of noise, interference and missed detections, bearing lines  from two passive sensors wiU intersect to determine a unique location (sparse scenario is assumed). However, in dense environments there may be multiple targets in a given plane, and the bearing lines of passive sensors will triangulate and create a number of false intersection points. In order to diminate these false intersection points correctly and quickly, two-level bearing measurement association algorithm is proposed in this paper. This method firstly uses a rule to eliminate some false intersection points, so the computation burden is decreased. Then, the maximum Ilkelhood algorithm [8] is used to associate the bearing measurements, which can ensure the true association rate is high. Simulation is also made, and the resuits reveal the feasibilay and validity of the bearing measurements association algorithm presented in hi paper, and multiple targets can be located and tracked at the same time by passive sensors.

2 Bearing Measurements Association  Let Z,(k) , Z , ( k )  , * a * ,  Z,(k)  denote the bearing measurement sets measured by M passive sensors at time k ,  where Z,(k)=(8,,,8,,,...,8~~ 1, s1,2;-, M, and N, denotes the number of the targets measured by the s* passive sensor.

We select one bearing measurement randofily from the measurement sets Zl(&) &(k) .Znrfk) to form a measurement combination, and so on The r?h bearing measurement combination is denoted as   0-780%8562-4jQ4?$20.00 02004 IEEE. 356    - Then, twr,level bearing measurement Y ,  = Y v  - Y ,  association algorithm is presented as hllows to judge whether these bearing measurement combinations are true or false one  2.1 First Level Association In order to reduce computation burden, one  bearing measurement of the i'" combination I C  Zl't12...w =ie,,, ,ezr2 1 is only combined with the next one, i.e. e,, 1s combined with &,, , ea, with 03,>, with e,,, , and so on.

Use of eqs.(lO) and (12), then yields  = DT $ P-'D ja  This variable a&, submits tof(2) distribution approximately. Similarly, one can obtain variables of the other intersection points. In order to reduce computation burden, one intersection point is only     test variable S, i.e.

The partition that has the maximum likelihood firnction is the true one, and the measurement combinations of this  cmespmd to differed true targets, Ih"-'u  3*  Suppose three passive sensors are used to locate and track three targets. The imgets are naval shps, and he velocity of them is 1 5 d s .  The  preserved measurement sampling interval of these passive sensors is 1s.

When masured beering error standard deviation Is all o.s*, through Mante-carlo ev-ents, the  range errors o? these three targets are shown in Fig.1 to Fig.3 respectively, and table 1 k the  combinations form a set 27.

STEP  Fig2 R;mge mor of target 2  Fig3 Range mor of target 3  From table 1 one can see that when bearing measurement error is small the true correlation rate is hgh, and when bearing measurement error is large one can not obtain the accurate location coordinates of targets. From Fig. 1 to Fk.3 me can also see that through using the method discussed in this paper, passive location system can estimate the range of targets accurately, The simulation results also show that the location accuracy is sensitive to the be- measurement error, and it is also greatry dependent on the d~~tdxtion of passive sensors and the s e p t i o n  between targets and sensors.

4 Conclusions  Since there are more and more electronic countermeasures in modern war, people pay much more attention to the passive location technique  now. This paper studies the bearing measuremmts association algorithm, and presents a new method, that is t he  twDlevel bearing measurement association algorithm.
