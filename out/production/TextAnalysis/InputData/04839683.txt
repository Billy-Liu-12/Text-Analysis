Abstract?The performance of military ground vehicle systems quickly degrades due to high operation tempo and extreme environments while performing in-theater service.

Current maintenance methods associated with this degradation are not sufficiently optimized for cost and performance. To address this issue, the United States Army is implementing a policy of Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) and being supported by the Army Materiel System Analysis Activity (AMSAA). CBM is a plan of maintenance for a system based upon the actual condition of the system as enabled by the application of usage, diagnostic and prognostic processes executed on a Health and Usage Monitoring System (HUMS).
