Abstract Discovering ussociation d e s  is  one of' the mosi important l a s h  in data mining and many eflcient algoi'ithms were proposed ifl literature. Ho wever, the number of discovered rules is open so large, so the user cannol analyze all discovered nrles. To uvercome that problem several methods for mining interesting nrIes only huve been proposed. Mony measures have been pvoposcd in litevafure to determine the intercsiingnrss of the rule. In this paper we have selected (I total of eight dgerent measures, we have compared these rneaszires by zuing a data set and w e have mode some recommendation about the use of the measslriwjbr discoverir?g the most interesting r-ziles.

1. Introduction In the previous few years a lot o f  work is done in the field of data mining especially in finding association between items in a data base of customer transaction. Association rules identify items that are mast often bought along with certain other items by a significant fraction of the customers. For example, we may find that"95 percent of the customers who bought bread also bought milk." A rule may contain more than one item in the antecedent and the consequent of the mIe. Every mle must satisfy two user specified constraints: one is a measure of statistical significance called support and the other a measure of goodness of the rule called confidence. Tn this paper we have identified a set of measures as proposed by the literature and we have tried to conclude that a single measure alone can not determine the interestingness of the rule.

This paper is divided in to three sections the first section gives the fortnal definition (as presented in the literature) and some explanation of each measure. The measures we have chosen are Support, Confidence, Conviction, Lift, Piatetsky-Shapiro, Coverage, Correlation, and Odds ratio. The second section gives- us the calculatioii of each measure on our sample data (customer transactions) and the last section contains our recommendation on using which measure for discovering the interesting rules.

2. Description of Different Measures To make the measures comparable all measures are defined using probabilities. The probability of encountering itemset X is given by colmt( x&gt; ID1 P ( X )  = Where, count(X) is the numbcr o f  transactions that contain the itemset X and ID] is the size (number of transactions) of the database.

2.1. Support 111 Introduced by R. Agrawal, T. Imielinski, and A.

Swami. Mining associations between sets o f  items in large databases. In Proc. o f  the ACM SIGMOD Int'I Conference on Management of Data, pages 207-216, Washington D.C., May 1993.

Suppoit is defined on itemsets and gives the proportion of transactions that contain Z and therefore  is used as a measure of significance (importance) of an itemset. Since it basically uses the count of transactions it is often called a frequency constraint.

An itemset with a support greater than a set minimnm support threshold is called a frequent or large itemset.

Supports main feature i s  that it possesses the down-    Supports main feature i s  that it possesses the down- ward closure property (anti-monotonicity! which INMIC 2004 means that all subsets of a frequent set are also frequent This property {actually, the fact that no super set of infrequent set can be frequent) is used to prune the search space (usually thought o f  as a lattice or tree of item sets with increasing size) in level-wise algorithms (e.g., the Apriori algorithm).

The disadvantage of support is the rare item problem. Items that occur very infrequently in the data set are pruned although they would still produce interesting and potentially valuable rules. The rare item problem is important for transaction data which usually have a very uneven distribution of support for the individual items (few items arc used all the time and mos't item are rarely used).

Its values are in range EO; I]. If antecedent and consequent are not occurring in transactions it is equal to 0. And if they are occurring in all transactions its value is equal to 1 .

2.2. Confidence [I] Introduced by R. Agrawal, T. Imielinski, and A.

Swami. Mining associations between sets of items in large databases. In Pmc. of the ACM SIGMOD Int'l Conference on Management of Data, pages 207-2 16, Washington D.C., May 1993.

P(X and Y ) P ( X &gt; confidence(X -+ Y )  = Confidence is defined as the probability of seeing the rule's consequent under the condition that the transactions also contain the antecedent. Confidence is directed and gives different values for the rules X -+Y and Y+ X.

Confidence is not down-ward closed and was developed together with support by Agrawal et al. (the so-called suppart-con fidence framework). Support is first used to find frequent (significant) itemsets exploiting its down-ward closure property to prune the search space. Then confidence is used in a second step to produce rules from the frequent itemsets that exceed a min. confidence threshold.

A problem with confidence is that it is sensitive to the frequency of the consequent (Y) in the database, Caused by the way confidence is calculated, consequents with higher support will automatically produce higher confidence values even if there exists no association between the items.

Its values are i n  range [ O ;  I ] .  If antecedent and consequent are independent it is equal to 0. For implications occurring in all cases measure's value is equal to 1 .

2.3. Conviction [I) Introduced by Sergey Brin, Rajeev itlotwani, Jeffrey D. Ullman, and Shalom Tsur. Dynamic itemset counting and implication rules for market basket data.

In SIGMOD 1997, Proceedings ACM SIGMOD pages 255-264, Tucson, Arizona, USA, May 1997.

Conviction was developed as an alternative to confidence which was found to not capture direction of associations adequately. Conviction compares the probability that X appears without Y if they were dependent with the actual frequency of the appearance of X without Y. In that respect it i s  similar to lift (see section about lift on this page), however, it contrast to liR i t  is a directed measure since it also uses the information of the absence of the consequent. An interesting fact is that conviction is monotone in confidence and lift .

Its values are in range [ O ;  +m]. If antecedent and    Its values are in range [ O ;  +m]. If antecedent and consequent are independent it is equal to 1. For implications occurring in all cases measure's value is equal to +CO.

2.4. Lift [l] Introduced by S .  Brin, R. Motwani, J. D. Ullman, and S. Tsur. Dynamic itemset counting and impiication rules for market basket data. in Proc. of the ACM SIGMOD Int'l Conf. on Management of Data (ACM SIGMOD '97), pages 265-276, 1997.

Lift measures how many times more often X and Y occurs together than expected, if they where statistically independent. Lift is not down-ward closed and does not suffer from the rare item problem.

Its values are in range [a; fq. Values lower than 1 mean, that satisfying condition of antecedent decreases probability of consequent in comparison to unconditional probability. Consequently, values higher than 1 mean, that satisfying condition of antecedent increases probability of consequent. in comparison to unconditional probability. If antecedent and consequent are independent then lift i s  equal to I , 2.5. Leverage 111 2.8. Odds Ratio Introduced by Piatetsky-Shapiro, G., Discovery, analysis, and presentation of strong rules. Knowledge Discovery in Databases, 199 I:  p. 229-248.

Leverage measures the difference of X and Y appearing together in the data set and what would be expected if X and Y where statistically dependent. The rational in a sales setting is to find out how many more units (items X and Y together) are sold than expected from the independcnt sells. Using minimum leverage thresholds at the same time incorporates an implicit frequency constraint. e.g., for setting a min. leverage thresholds to 0.01% (corresponds to 10 occurrence in a data set with 100,000 transactions) one first can use an algoritliin to find all itemsets with minimum support of 0.01% and then filter the found item sets using the lcverage constraint. Because of this property leverage also can suffer from the rare item problem.

The odds-ratio is a statistical measure which is defined as the ratio of the odds of an event occurring in one group to the odds of it occurring in another group, or to a data-based estimate of that ratio. [3] P(X and Y ) P ( x  and r) P(X and y )P(x  and Y) odds( x + v) = Its values are in range [O; +ocJ. If antecedent and consequent are independent it is equal to 0. For strong associations its value is equal to +e 3. Comparison of Measures This section compares all the measures, discussed in the first section. We have chosen a data set on which we have performed the A-priori algorithm to find out the frequent item set. AH the measure are applied on each of the frequent item set, and then in the end the recommendation d a t e d  to choosing a measure to decide which rule is interesting are given.

2.6. Coverage [l] 3.1. Sample Data P(X  and Y ) PV) cov evage(X + Y )  = I t  shows what?part of iteinsets from consequent is covered by a rule. Its values are in range [O; 11.

2.7. Correlation Correlation is a statistical technique which can show whether and how strongly pairs of variableditemsets are related.

Corcelation is a bi-variant measure of association    Corcelation is a bi-variant measure of association (strength) of the relationship between two variableditemsets. It varies from -1  (perfect negative linear relationship) to I @erfect linear relationship) and in between them 0 means no relationship. To the extent that there is a nonlinear relationship between the two variables being correlated, correlation will understate the relationship. [4] The sample data for the analysis purpose is taken from a store database of customer transactions there are six different types of items and a total of ten transactions. In each transaction a 1 represents the presence of an item while a 0 represents the absence of an item from the market basket.

Table 1: Sample Transactions TID I Items 1 3.2. Generating Frequent Itemsets Rules A-tF F+A B+D D+B The frequent item set generated by the sample data using A-priori algorithm is shown in the following table: Measures Confidence Correlation Odds Ratio 0.83 0.82 ca 1 .oo 0.82 a, 1.00 0.65 CO 0.71 0.65 00 ltemset 40% 50% 5 0% 40% The minimum support used for the generation of the frequent item set is 40%.

3.3. Calculations All the measures discussed in the first section are calculated for each nile, which is the output of the A- priori algorithm. The results are shown in table 3.

3. Conclusion Any measure alone cannot determine the Interestingness of the rules. We have to look at a combination of different measures in order to get the rule that is really interesting. There are two types of measures one is symmetric measures and the other is asymmetric If we look at a symmetric measure e.g.

Odds Ratio we can conclude the A-tF, F+A both  the rules are interesting but the Confidence value of F+A suggest that it is more interesting as compared to A+F hence we can not conclude alone from a symmetric measure we also have to look for an asymmetric measure in .order to know the interestingness of such types of rules A+B, B+A.

The table sown above contains the subset of measures and rulcs taken from the above table. The Odds Ratio in this table suggest that all the rules are interesting but if we look at the Correlation along with the Odds Ratio we will come to know that A+F and F+A are more strongly related to each other. On combining another measure i.e. Confidence with these two measures we will come to know that only the rule F+A is more interesting, 5.
