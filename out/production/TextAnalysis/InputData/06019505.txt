Abstract--Mutually-inversistic rough fuzzy logic is the integration of mutually-inversistic fuzzy logic constructed by the author and rough fuzzy sets. Mutually-inversistic fuzzy logic can be used to mine fuzzy association rules on the finer granule objects, while mutually-inversistic rough fuzzy logic can be used to mine fuzzy association rules on the coarser granule equivalence classes.

I. INTRODUCTION The truth table of material implication in classical  logic[1] cannot be used to make hypothetical inference. To remedy it, the author proposes mutually-inversistic logic[2,3] .

Fuzzy logic[4] is an extension of classical logic, the definition of fuzzy implication also cannot be used to make fuzzy hypothetical inference. To remedy it, the author extends mutually-inversistic logic to mutually-inversistic fuzzy logic, also called mutually-inversistic logic with uncertainty[5] . Rough fuzzy set[6] is the integration of rough sets[7] and fuzzy sets. Mutually-inversistic rough fuzzy logic is part of granular computing[8]. In mutually-inversistic fuzzy logic, fuzzy association rules on the finer granule objects can be mined. In order to mine fuzzy association rules on the coarser granule equivalence classes, the author integrates mutually-inversistic fuzzy logic and rough fuzzy set to form mutually-inversistic rough fuzzy logic.

Compared with rough fuzzy logic, mutually-inversistic rough fuzzy logic needs less rules.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 briefly introduces rough fuzzy sets. Section 3 briefly introduces mutually-inversistic logic. Section 4 briefly introduces mutually-inversistic fuzzy logic. Section 5 discusses mutually-inversistic rough fuzzy logic. Section 6 compares with related work. Section 7 is concluding remarks.



II. ROUGH FUZZY SETS  Rough fuzzy set is the integration of rough sets and fuzzy sets. It introduces equivalence relations in the definition of fuzzy sets, defines membership grades on the equivalence classes. The objects in the same equivalence  class have the same membership grade. The definition  of rough fuzzy set is given below:  Suppose U is the given universe, A is a fuzzy set, R is an equivalence relation on U, the partition R make is U/R={U1 , U2 , ? , Un }, then the lower and upper approximations of the fuzzy set A under the equivalence relation R are  ?RA (Ui)=inf{?A(u):u?Ui}, ? R A(Ui)=sup{?A(u):u?Ui},  respectively.



III. MUTUALLY-INVERSISTIC LOGIC Material implication in classical logic is defined as  Table 1.

Table 1 material implication A    B  |  A?B ----------------------- F    F  |     T F    T  |     T T    F  |     F T    T  |     T   Table 1 correctly reflects the establishment of an  implicational proposition. Take the establishment of ?if it rains, then the ground is wet? as an example. On Aug. 20, 2006, in Xi?an, it rained, and the ground was wet. This is the fourth row of Table 1. On Sept. 30, 2006, in Beijing, it did not rain, but the sprayers sprayed the ground wet. This is the second row of Table 1. On Oct. 1, 2006, in Beijing, it did not rain, and the ground was not wet. This is the first row of Table 1. It never happens that it rains and the ground is not wet. That is, the third row of Table 1 never occurs.

Therefore, from ?it rains? and ?the ground is wet?, we establish ?if it rains, then the ground is wet?.

Table 1 cannot be employed to make hypothetical inference. The affirmative expression of hypothetical inference is from A?B being true and A being true to infer B being true. The negative expression of hypothetical inference is from A?B being true and B being false to infer A being false. While Table 1 is a truth function, and the evaluation of a function is from the arguments to the value.

In Table 1, A and B are the arguments, A?B is the value.

So, the evaluation of Table 1 can only be from A and B to A ?B.

Although Table 1 cannot be used to make hypothetical inference, its inverse functions can. Following this clue, mutually inverse implication ?-1 is defined as Tables 2 through 4.

Table 2 Establishment of ?-1 A    B  |    A?-1B ----------------------------- F    F  |       T F    T  |       n T    F  |       F T    T  |       T  Table 3 Employment one of ?-1 A?-1B    A  |  B --------------------------- F       F  |  u F       T  |  u T       F  |  u T       T  |  T  Table 4 Employment two of ?-1 A?-1B    B  |  A -------------------------- F       F  |  u F       T  |  u T       F  |  F T       T  |  u  N in Table 2 means ?needn?t determine?. U in Tables 3 and 4 means ?unable to determine?. Tables 3 and 4 are the inverse functions of Table 2, A? -1B in them are the arguments. Table 2 is similar to Table 1, used to establish A ?-1B. After it is established, it becomes known, becomes the argument, then we can employ Tables 3 and 4 to make hypothetical inference. Table 3 is the affirmative expression of hypothetical inference, saying that if A?-1B is true and A is true then we can infer that B is true, in the other three cases we cannot determine the truth value of B. Table 4 is the negative expression of hypothetical inference, saying that if A?-1B is true and B is false then we can infer that A is false, in the other three cases we cannot determine the truth value of A.



IV. MUTUALLY-INVERSISTIC FUZZY LOGIC There are 12 logical operators in mutually-inversistic  fuzzy logic. Three of them, namely, ?f (fuzzy negation), ?f (fuzzy conjunction), ?f-1 (fuzzily mutually inverse implication) are indispensable. ?f a is defined as 1-a. A1 ?f a2 is defined as (a1 +a2 )/2. ?f-1 manifests itself as the mutually inverse processes of establishment (mining) and  employment. Establishment process is from the membership grade of the antecedent a and that of the consequent c to establish (to mine) the strength of support (membership grade, certainty) of the major premise (the fuzzy association rule) a?f-1 c. Employment process is from the membership grade of the major premise a?f-1 c and that of the minor premise a to infer that of the conclusion c.

Establishment process can be described by the equi-strength-of-support lines diagram shown in Fig. 1.

Suppose a=0.75, c=0.5, shown as point A in Fig. 1.

Point A is on the 0.75 equi-strengtb-of-support line, so, the strength of support ss of a?f-1 c is 0.75.

Establishment process can also be described analytically. All of the equi-strengtb-of-support lines in Fig.

1 can be written as the slope-intercept equation of straight lines (1):  c=a+int.       (1) Int in (1) are the intercepts of the straight lines on axis c.

From (1) we can obtain (2):  int=c?a.      (2) According to Fig. 1, the relationship between int and ss is given in (3): 0.5,  0.5?int?1  (neutral area) 1?int, 0?int<0.5  (support area) ss=   1+int, ?0.5<int<0  (support area)  (3) 1+int, int=?0.5    (neutral area)  1+int, ?1?int<?0.5  (opposition area)  Suppose a=0.75, c=0.5. By (2) we obtain  int=0.5?0.75=?0.25. Int belongs to the third row of (3), so, ss=1+int=1+(?0.25)=0.75. The result is the same as point A in Fig. 1.



V. MUTUALLY-INVERSISTIC ROUGH FUZZY  LOGIC Mutually-inversistic rough fuzzy logic is used to mine  the lower and upper approximations of fuzzy association rules of equivalence classes. It is also used to make predictions.

Fig.1  Equi-strength-of ?support line diagram  c  a 0 1   0.5   0.75 0.5  0.25   0.5 0.5  0.75  A ?     Suppose we have an English study relational database shown in Table 5.

Table 5 English study relational database  Universe U  English study time every  day T  Attention A  English test score  S x1 3 100% 90 x2 4 75% 100 x3 2 25% 70 x4 3 0% 60   We want to mine the fuzzy association rule: If x?s  English study time every day (T) is longer, then x?s English test score (S) is better. Longer and better are fuzzy concepts, their membership functions are shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3.

Using Fig. 2 to convert the second column T of Table 5,  we obtain the fuzzy set T: T=0.5/x1 +0.75/x2 +0.25/x3 +0.5/x4 .

Take the third column A of Table 5 as the equivalence  relation, take A?50% as the equivalence class Attention={x1, x2}, take A<50% as the equivalence class Inattention={x3, x4}; we obtain the lower approximation AT and upper approximation A T of T.

AT=0.5/x1 +0.5/x2 +0.25/x3 +0.25/x4 .

A T=0.75/x1 +0.75/x2 +0.5/x3 +0.5/x4 .

? AT(Attention)=0.5, ? AT(Inattention)=0.25, ? A T(Attention)=0.75, ? A T(Inattention)=0.5.

Using Fig. 3 to convert the fourth column S of Table 5, we obtain the fuzzy set S.

S=0.75/x1 +1/x2 +0.25/x3 +0/x4 .

Again, take A as the equivalence relation, we obtain the lower approximation AS and upper approximation A S of S.

AS=0.75/x1 +0.75/x2 +0/x3 +0/x4 , A S=1/x1 +1/x2 +0.25/x3 +0.25/x4 ,  ? AS(Attention)=0.75, ? AS(Inattention)=0, ? A S(Attention)=1, ? A S(Inattention)=0.25.

The fuzzy association rule we want to mine is T?f-1S  (if x?s English study time every day is longer, then x?s English test score is better). And (2) becomes (4):  int=?AS??AT     (4) For the int obtained by (4) we use (3) to calculate the strength of support ss.

Now, for equivalence class Attention, let?s calculate the lower approximation of T?f-1S:  int=?AS(Attention) ??AT(Attention)=0.75?0.5=0.25.

Int=0.25 belongs to the second row of (3), thus,  ss=1?int=1?0.25=0.75.

So, the strength of support ss of the lower  approximation of T?f-1S of the equivalence class Attention is 0.75. Likewise, the strength of support ss of the upper approximation of T?f-1S of the equivalence class Attention, the strength of support ss of the lower approximation of T?f-1S of the equivalence class Inattention, the strength of support ss of the upper approximation of T?f-1S of the equivalence class Inattention are all 0.75.

Now, we can make predictions. Suppose x5 study English 3 hours every day, and his attention is 75%, let?s predict his English test score.

The major premise is the rule mined ?if x study English every day longer, then x?s Engligh test score is better?. The minor premise is ?x5 study English every day longer?. From the major premise and the minor premise we can infer the conclusion ?x5 ?s English test score is better?.

And the membership grade of the major premise times that of the minor premise is that of the conclusion. By Fig. 2, 3 hours is converted to membership grade 0.5, so, the membership grade of the minor premise is 0.5. And the membership grade of the major premise is 0.75. The membership grade of the conclusion is that of the major premise times that of the minor premise, that is, 0.75*0.5=0.375. So, the membership grade that x5 has a  T  Fig.2  Membership function for longer  ?longer   5 3 1  S  Fig.3  Membership function for better  ?better   100 60 80     better English test score is 0.375. Using Fig. 3 to convert 0.375 back to score, we obtain that x5 ?s English test score may be 75.



VI. COMPARISON WITH RELATED WORK In rough fuzzy logic, the membership functions for  longer, medium, and shorter are given in Fig. 4, that for better, average, and worse are given in Fig. 5.

Fig.4 Membership functions for longer, medium,and shorter               Fig.5 Membership functions for better, average, and worse   In rough fuzzy logic, three rules need to be mined ?if x study English every day longer, then x?s English test score is better?. ?if x study English every day medium, then x?s English test score is average?, ?if x study English every day shorter, then x?s English test score is worse?. While in mutually-inversistic rough fuzzy logic, Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 are proportional functions, and the equi-strength-of-support line  1 stretches from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner, also a proportional function. This means one rule is enough ?if x study English every day longer, then x?s English test score is better?.



VII. CONCLUDING REMARKS  In mutually-inversistic fuzzy logic, fuzzy association rules at the finer granule objects are mined. In mutually-inversistic rough fuzzy logic, fuzzy association rules at the coarser granule equivalence classes are mined.

In mutually-inversistic fuzzy logic, every object in the universe must be mined. In mutually-inversistic rough fuzzy logic, an equivalence class need only to be mined twice, once for the lower approximation, once for the upper approximation, thus, lowering the computational complexity. Compared with rough fuzzy logic, less rule is needed.
