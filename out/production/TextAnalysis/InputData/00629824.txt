Grouping Web Page References into Transactions for Mining World  Wide Web Browsing Patterns *

Abstract Web-based organizations often generate and collect  large volumes of data in their daily operations. Ana- lyzing such data involves the discovery of meaningful relationships from a large collection of primarily un- structured data, often stored in Web server access logs.

While traditional domains for  data mining, such as  point of sale databases, have naturally defined trans- actions, there is n o  convenient method of clustering web references into transactions. This paper identifies a model of user browsing behavior that separates web page references into those made for navigation pur- poses and those for  information content purposes. A transaction identification method based on  the brows- ing model is defined and successfully tested against other methods, such as the maximal forward reference algorithm proposed in [I]. Transactions identified by the proposed methods are used to discover association rules from real world data using the W E B M I N E R  sys- tem [TI.

1 Introduction and Background As more organizations rely on the World Wide Web  to  conduct business, traditional strategies and tech- niques for market analysis need to be revisited. Or- ganizations collect large volumes of data and analyze it to determine the life time value of customers, cross marketing strategies across products, and effectiveness of promotional campaigns. In the Web, such infor- mation is generally gathered automatically by Web servers and collected in server or access logs. Anal- ysis of server access data can provide information on how to restructure a Web site for increased effective- ness, better management of workgroup communica- tion, and analyzing user access patterns to target ads  This work was supported in part by NSF grant ASC-  to  specific groups of users. Most existing Web analysis tools [2, 3, S] provide very primitive mechanisms for reporting user activity, i.e. it is possible to determine the number of accesses to individual files, the times of visits, and URLs of users. However, these tools usually provide little analysis of data relationships among the accessed files, which is essential to fully utilizing the data gathered in daily transactions. Web server access logs have been used as a testbed for the application of certain data mining tasks such as the discovery of frequent episodes [6]. Recently, maximal forward ref- erences have been proposed [l] as a way to extract meaningful user access sequences.

The overall task of Web usage mining is not one of simply adapting existing algorithms to new data.

Because of many unique characteristics of the client- server model in the World Wide Web, including rad- ical differences between the physical and logical data organizations of web repositories, it is necessary to develop a new framework to enable the mining pro- cess. Specifically, there are a number of issues in pre- processing data for  mining that must be addressed be- fore the mining algorithms can be run. These include developing a model of web log data, developing tech- niques to  clean/filter the raw data to eliminate outliers and/or irrelevant items, grouping individual page ac- cesses into semantic units (i.e. transactions), and spe- cializing generic data mining algorithms to take ad- vantage of the specific nature of web log data.

This paper presents a general model for identi- fying transactions for data mining from WWW log data. The specific contributions include (i) definition of generic transaction identification modules, (ii) def- inition of a user browsing behavior model that can be used to  separate important or information con- tent page references from references used for naviga- tion purposes, (iii) development of specific transac- tion identification modules based on web page refer- ence lengths or web site structure, (iv) and evaluation  0-8186-8230-2/97 $10.00 0 1997 IEEE    of the different transaction identification modules us- ing generated server log data with known association rules.

2 User Browsing Behavior Model  In order to group individual web page references into meaningful transactions for data mining, an un- derlying model of the user?s browsing behavior is needed. A reasonable assumption seems to  be that a given user treats each page in one of two ways, either for navigation purposes to find links to the desired data, or for actual information or content purposes.

What is merely a navigation page for one user may be a content page for another. While it may be possible to classify some web pages based on the number of links versus text contained on the page, most pages will probably not fit clearly into only one category.

For example, a page that contains a title followed by a list of links to  other pages can easily be classified as a navigation page. However, a page with a mix of text and links can not easily be classified as naviga- tional or content, and could serve a different purpose for different users.
