Dispersed generation is increasing in distribution networks. This development is affecting the protection behaviour adversely. Maloperation of protection relays becomes likely. Thus methods of protection security assessment are necessary to cope with the new network conditions of distributed generation and all their impacts. This paper is presenting such a methodology using fully software assisted procedures. A systematic protection security assessment of variants of network and protection configurations is feasible with a restricted operating expense. For the evaluation and illustration of the big amount of output data, an appropriate graphical approach will be shown.
