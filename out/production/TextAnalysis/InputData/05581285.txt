Data Mining In Personalized Travel Information  System

Abstract?Information retrieval is the most popular database technology, which is focusing on data analysis, association rules, pattern discovery and so on. It is critical to find efficient ways of mining large data sets. In this paper we present a Personalized Travel Information System, called PTIS.  PTIS can automatically link to the travel sites to collect information, and then create new data rules.  According the rules to provides valuable information for tourism to make travel plan.  In addition, we also evaluate the impact of parameters on the algorithm.

I.  INTRODUCTION Data mining in recent years is a very important issue,  especially in this decade of information explosion.  How to use information technology to manage and extract data to useful information is currently one of the important researches.

Marketing of tourist destination has recently become a very interesting field of research.  In particular, how to make the decision from the large information in web sites for the tourists has become a very important issue in the marketing research in the tourism industry, since many countries use promotion and global marketing in the web sites.  Such research is increasingly important since the information of a destination is an essential factor in influencing tourist satisfaction and choices (Castro et al.,2007; Han, 1990; Chin-Tsai Lin) [1][2][3].

However, data mining is very effective for determining destination for tourists.  It also has been widely adopted to predict the tourists behavior (Giudici & Oasseribem2002)[4].

Data mining is one of the most popular methods for identifying potential customer knowledge in business database to improve decision-making in a firm, by automatically or semi- automatically mining and analyzing large amounts of data in a business databases, and discovering potential significant underlying patterns and association rules in the data (Hsu & Chen, 2007; Liao, Hsieh) [5][6].  K-means is widely used to analyze market segmentation and position.  Data mining is undoubtedly an effective way of discovering the destination for tourists.

Tourism web sites provide a wide range of tourist information, but users do not have all information on demand.

This study has two main aims: (1) to adopt data mining to build a model for assessing a destination for tourists and (2) to help tourism planners to meet their requirements of their target travel.  In this paper, we proposed an algorithm to establish the Personalized Travel Information System (called PTIS) which can categorize the information and through the association rules establish that can help to find the useful information.

The article is organized as follows.  In Section 2 we briefly describe the related works.  In Section 3 we present the personalized travel information algorithm and analyze its performance.  In Section 4 we describe several experiments we did with in implementation of our algorithm on large data sets.

Finally, Section 5 we present our conclusions and future work.



II. REALTED WORKS Clustering in data mining is a very important technology, it  can be a large number of data to identify the distribution of data and find its hidden meaning. Clustering analyzes data which gathered similar information together.  The biggest difference between clustering and classification is that clustering is not pre-set categories represent meaning, adding new property prior to cluster similar data elements together into groups of clusters.

Association rules were first proposed by Agrawal and Srikant [7] to, mainly, extract the items, out of a data bank, that frequently occur jointly in transactions.  Hence, the rules are often used in a market basket analysis. For example, the items within purchase transactions are the purchased items in a market's sales data bank, and a pattern extracted by association rules will be the items often jointly purchased. Agarwal et al.

proposed an Apriori feature: To a frequent itemset, all its non- empty subsets must also be frequent [7].

The Apriori algorithm will generate a big volume of candidate itemsets in the Join portion, while using a frequent pattern tree will not. The tree adopts pattern growth style to recursively establish even longer patterns. Since Apriori-like algorithm requires multiple scanning a data bank, Han and Pei et al. proposed a pattern growth concept in 2000 [9] [10] and     initiated a free span [10] and a prefix span [8] [9] in a pattern growth algorithm to mine sequence patterns.

K-means is the widely used to cutting-type clustering algorithm based on (J. MacQueen,1967) [11], it is a cluster center of gravity as a cluster of representative points, if the cluster does not necessarily representative of the point, so it can find the best clustering.



III. PORPOSED ALGORITHM The expert traveler agent suggests user traveling package.

The tour packages available are defined in a Travel Agency application, according to the variations in the supply and demand of tours. Traveler is in charge of offering these tours to customers in a personalized way.  To achieve this, traveler learns about a customer?s preferences through different sources.

The information obtained from the different sources is used to build the user profile.  A user profile comprises: the content- based user profile, the collaborative user profile and the demographic user profile.  The content-based user profile contains knowledge about the user?s traveling preferences obtained from his/her purchases and complaints.  The algorithm is doing research of this part.

The proposed algorithm is divided into two parts:  ? Data collection  ? Cluster establish  Fig.1 shows the model of the PTIS. A two stage method was used to build the PTIS model.  In the first stage, the contents of travel web sites will be collected.  The second stage uses the K-Means to clustering the data sets.

Figure1.  Research Model of Personalized Travel Information  System  A. Data Collection Data collection is simply how information is gathered.

There are various methods of data collection such as personal interviewing, telephone, mail and the Internet. Depending on the survey design, these methods can be used separately or combined.

In this study the data were collected from 20 Taiwan Tourism Forum and web sites. This initial search resulted in a set of 13,028 WWW pages containing all or most of the elements. These were scanned and the apparently relevant pages were retrieved and stored for further analysis.  The data contain web contents and the information about train, airplane,  travel packages, climate and hotel price.  Fig. 2 shows the data collection from several web sites.

B. Cluster Establish Cluster K-Means is optimized for speed, and is suitable for  very large data sets.  Moreover, K-Means can handle different types of variables, especially those that occur in database records.  Clustering is one of the most popular data mining methods.  The goal of clustering to identify distinct clusters in data sets.  We classify the web sites information into four categories: recognize people custom, reverence historical humanity, regard environmental construction and respect recreational element.

The procedure follows a simple and easy way to classify a given data set through a certain number of clusters (assume k clusters) fixed a priori. The main idea is to define k centroids, one for each cluster. The main idea is to define k centroids, one for each cluster. These centroids should be placed in a cunning way because of different location causes different result. So, the better choice is to place them as much as possible far away from each other. The next step is to take each point belonging to a given data set and associate it to the nearest centroid.

When no point is pending, the first step is completed and an early group is done. At this point we need to re-calculate k new centroids as centers of the clusters resulting from the previous step. After we have these k new centroids, a new binding has to be done between the same data set points and the nearest new centroid. A loop has been generated. As a result of this loop we may notice that the k centroids change their location step by step until no more changes are done. In other words centroids do not move any more.  Finally, this algorithm aims at minimizing an objective function, in this case a squared error function. The objective function is shown in Eq. (1)      )(   |||| cx j n  i  j  i  k  j  J ?= ?? ==  (1)  Where 2)( |||| cx jji ?  is a chosen distance measure  between a data point x j  i  )(  and the cluster centre c j  is an  Data Base K-Means Cluster 1  Cluster2  Cluster3  Cluster4  Travelers? Destination  Data Collection  Web sites    indicator of the distance of the n data points from their respective cluster centres.

Table I presents the average results of influential factors and the levels of affinity for the destination. The factors include environmental, traffic (train and airplane), climate and hotel price, landscape and the culture.  People in cluster 1 are most satisfied with traffic ? airplane (mean=2.847) and hotel price (mean=2.684).  Clearly, this group people tend to use airplane for traveling.   In cluster 2, cluster 3 and cluster 4, travelers like to take train for traveling.  It seems train is still the best choice for people in traveling.

V. CONCLUSIONS Data mining is an important real-life application for  businesses.  It is critical to find efficient ways of mining large data sets.  The increase in market-driven competition and adoption of information technology causes tourism market conditions and visitors? needs to change rapidly.  Travelers are no longer satisfied with mass tourism information anymore, and mass tourism customization becomes an alternative to destination variety choices that are efficient resources and reasonable cost structure.  The ability to fulfill diverse tourists?  needs is insufficient to catch the new opportunities if destinations cannot sense the changes.

This paper applies data mining to analyze enormous data sets, and help defines the customization and contribution, thus formulating the Personalized Travel Information System model application approach.  We proposed the algorithm that gathering the web contents for clustering and filtering the conditions to meet the tourists? need.  Our experiments also show that has a good reference for tourism.

In the future, our study will focus on the fully automated processes and more extensive information to provide tourist information more accurately.
