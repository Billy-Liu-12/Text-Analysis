OpenFridge: A Platform for Data Economy for Energy  Efficiency Data

Abstract? The energy sector is becoming an important showcase for data economy, because of the societal, environmental and business value that can be created based on the vast amounts of newly available energy-related data.

Utilizing the explosive growth in Big Data technology solutions, and the steady march of open data initiatives, this development is mainly driven by the requirements regarding CO2 emissions reduction, and the vision of environmentally sustainable energy consumption and production in the Smart Grid. The market for energy efficient home appliances, renewable energy generation equipment, and accompanying services that monitor, control and increase efficiency of energy consumption and own energy generation is drastically increasing, pulling the demand and expectations of the mass consumers. In addition to almost well- established automated metering and demand response business models, one interesting new opportunity is emerging: based on the data directly available from home devices and appliances, their manufacturers can develop new customer engagement approaches and added-value services. In this paper we describe the preliminary architecture that integrates Big Data and semantic overlay components, developed in the project OpenFridge with the goal to create data economy for energy efficiency information. The project addresses different challenges of offering specific type of energy efficiency information to various interested stakeholders (appliance manufacturers, end users, utilities, municipalities, etc.) under the new access mechanisms and business models. The initial service focuses on energy consumption analysis of large household appliance(s) such as a fridge, and involves the real end user communities.

Index Terms? Energy Awareness, Data-centric Energy Services

I. INTRODUCTION Data is the source of knowledge and competitiveness. The  concept of the data value chain has been present for many years now, but recent advances in service, semantic, cloud, and big data technology are making real data economies possible [1].

In the energy domain, automatically read energy meters? data is recognized as the number one enabler for the Smart Grid, as it creates a basis for more efficient approaches to  power management, in particular involving integration of the distributed renewable generators and flexible demand [2]. It is estimated that the ?world will have 250 million smart meters by 2015, representing a $3.9 billion market? [3]. The smart meter as the central part of the automated metering infrastructure is often a synonym for two-way exchange of the consumption / production data and the tariff data between the consumers and the power sector. Hence, smart metering generates new business models and new tariffs, and the smart meter is recognized as an essential hardware enabler for the data economy in the Smart Grid.

However, it is also obvious that the metering concept will need to develop beyond measurements at the aggregated household level. As the metering technology matures, it will integrate many different fine-granular metering components measuring energy consumption directly at the appliances, or the generating equipment. This may help to directly close some demand management control loops at the level of particular energy service (lighting, cooling, heating?) [4].

In the same time, a new generation of home appliances are offered that are far more energy efficient than the old ones.

The European Commission has released a delegated regulation with regard to the energy labeling of household appliances.

This should help consumers to decide on energy saving standards when replacing for example an old refrigerator with a new one. The energy efficiency index (EEI) categorizes refrigerating appliances from A+++ for very good to G for very bad. The EEI is defined by this regulation and shows an indication of the annual power consumption of the device relative to reference consumption. It denotes that an A+++ appliance is saving in minimum 78% of the reference appliance.

Consequently, for a consumer, exchanging an old appliance with a new one may be the best step towards saving energy and lowering the energy bill. Energy awareness is an important motivation for such a decision, but energy awareness at the level of particular energy service is still not well supported. Even when user measures consumption of individual appliances by using smart plugs and systems based      on them (e.g. such as [5]), he is typically offered only low- informative one-hour aggregation of energy consumption and no insight in what usage patterns would lead to increased energy efficiency.

In this paper we present the preliminary results of the OpenFridge industrial research initiative, which goal is to contribute to data economy for energy efficiency by creating high-performance user-friendly infrastructure for on-line assessment and comparison of home appliances? efficiency information in a broader context of different usage parameters and within a community of users. The goal is to provide necessary explanations to motivate corresponding users? actions towards improving the energy efficiency of services.

In addition, this data is a valuable input for the business sector.

The OpenFridge platform integrates Big Data and semantic technology: the Big Data domain guarantee the maintenance of large volume of raw data, and offers analytics tools to transform raw data into the parameterized information; the semantic domain is where new data models (ontologies) are used to link parameterized energy efficiency information with the usage context information within a semantic repository ? the knowledgebase - with reasoning and querying capabilities. Combined with an elaborate content management platform it supports interfaces for community building and access to add-value data services.

The focus of the first OpenFridge pilot is on the energy efficiency assessment of refrigerators as they are the largest energy consuming home appliance. The same principles, however hold for other appliances as well.

This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews relevant enablers for data economy in the energy efficiency domain, and outlines the OpenFridge approach, Section 3 presents the architecture and the workflow designed for the OpenFridge platform, and Section 4 concludes the paper.



II. ENABLERS FOR OPEN ENERGY DATA SERVICES AND OPENFRIDGE APPROACH  The volume of public open data, as well as the enterprise and private - closed ? data, which can be shared is growing exponentially. In the energy domain, the home automation data can bring energy efficiency at the new level with products reporting their life cycles, provenance and quality, and contribute to better planning, citizen inclusion, understanding of social trends and their translation into services that come closer to meeting consumers? needs. A whole new industry implementing services on top of large data sets can be envisioned. In line with this, the EU Commission has launched an Open Data Strategy for Europe [6], which is expected to deliver a ?40 billion boost to the EU?s economy each year.

On the other hand, the success of semantic technologies (as they are already used by the Web companies such as BBC, Google, Yahoo) is being gradually extended to important high impact industry segments and markets ensuring that they thrive and generate value. Some successful examples of opening previously ?closed? data, that already exist for other  segments are the biggest database of all kind of information regarding steel, or the database with information about companies? financial data or affiliations and with information how to do target marketing.

The attempts to extend these approaches into the segment of Internet of Things have already come to fruition. A number of studies envisioned pioneering concepts of future domestic communication technologies since Weiser?s seminal paper [7].

Concepts such as ambient intelligence, pervasive computing and the internet of things are interchangeably used, referring to the human-computer interactions that are invisible but everywhere. Recent studies in smart homes recognized that limitations for acceptance still remain such as the high percentage of old house stocking, limited network connectivity, and little attention to real user needs [8]. Despite this, there are a number of smart home projects such as Georgia Tech?s Aware Home, MIT?s Place Lab, Microsoft? MS Home and Samsung?s Smart Home Project. The extension of the semantic approach for the home energy management has been reported as well [9].

There are tree important enablers for open energy data services: hardware interfaces for data acquisitions, interfaces for data services with privacy and security protection, and interfaces for community building. These are described in the subsequent sections.

A. Hardware Interfaces for Energy Data Acquisition For the fine-granular measurements of the energy  consumption in home the availability of networked in-home metering solutions is an essential requirement. Regarding innovative hardware settings, different companies are pioneering smart plugs, and Home Gateway solutions are evolving which are able to connect and control a large variety of heterogeneous devices. E.g. Cisco is applying its Home Gateway Controller in pilot projects under the Connected Urban Development initiative, particularly in Madrid.

The OpenFridge is using a mature smart plug solution with an open web-interface (PlugWise) [5]. The metering technology deployed in smart plugs will eventually be deployed directly at the appliances or other energy consumers, and the web service interface is currently considered the most promising standard for accessing services of different home gateway solutions [10]. Therefore the platform can be easily extended for other similar systems of emerging solutions in the future.

B. Data Services with Privacy and Security Protection Regarding the relevant services, several projects have  already addressed user requirements and response mostly regarding the smart metering service. One example of an energy efficiency service for end-consumers was a Google?s PowerMeter, which was based on the technical infrastructures of partnering providers and manufacturers, and has been retired in summer 2011 due to the fact that the ?efforts have not scaled as quickly as we would have liked?, the latter caused presumably by the high entry barrier to the platform restricted by B2B agreements.

Pachube (lately sold to LogMeIn) is a platform for supporting data streams in general, and it currently integrates     also individual data streams relevant to energy usage; the platform is not bound to any specific smart home hardware and it does not provide energy efficiency services. In contrary to Pachube, OpenFridge focuses on provisioning of energy efficiency information rather than live streams.

Among research approaches, semantically enabled demotic systems have been constructed [11;12], but user acceptance aspects are reported only within the scope of small scale controlled studies. Also purely Web-based services and interfaces for energy awareness have been designed, however, without connections to sensors and smart homes [13]. Also semantically enabled platforms for mashing up sensor data are currently being developed [14].

Semantic-based approach to achieve privacy protection through fine-grained access control mechanisms is generic and flexible: the use of a high level access control specification language allows the definition of a variety of access control user requirements. The RDF access control approach adopted [15] is designed to scale, as it orients itself at previous work on database systems, provides a formal semantics as in [16], and proposes an annotation-based enforcement mechanism.

Even where technical development is relatively simple, such as the RFID, barriers to acceptance related to privacy, security and trust, hinder diffusion of ubiquitous computing in domestic environments. In [17] authors highlighted the incompatible issue of security login in ubiquitous computing environments, as users were required to constantly access a wide variety of devices. It has also been argued that the security and privacy issue were deeply intertwined with concerns such as system control and information sharing [18].

C. Community building for usage of linked energy data Energy efficiency domain has numerous heterogeneous  communities of stakeholders that can be addressed, and the essence of ontologies are to inseparably reflect the communities using them [19;20], OpenFridge approach for ontology engineering will be inseparably connected with the OpenFridge communities.

Today multiple initiatives on generic data repositories are currently appearing on the market such as DataMarket, Factual, Infochimps. Certain existing datamarkets have address specific communities (for example, Timetric, focusing on economic data) ensuring the data quality standards (e.g. by relying on a limited number of verified data providers, like Windows Azure Marketplace Datamarket), however, none of them address the energy efficiency field. Accordingly the key specifics of OpenFridge platform is related to handling sensitive energy efficiency data with clear concerned consumer and business addressees and communities.

A success in applied services-driven research and industrial settings to a large extent depends on the ability to identify and adopt promising directions and technologies which are leading to economically viable services or products.

For OpenFridge platform the key enabler of approaching energy data-intensive services market is integration of the Big Data and semantic technology which provides the cutting edge  of the data analytics and data-as-service interfaces.

OpenFridge focuses on infrastructure for scalable and fine- granular semantically linked data and services to unleash commercialization potential of energy efficiency data.



III. THE OPENFRIDGE SYSTEM The OpenFridge aims to open energy efficiency data of the  home appliances for two different types of users envisioned.

On the one hand, there is a community of home adopters ? the owners of the appliances - who contribute the data about the appliances as well as the measurements of the usage profiles acquired within controlled data acquisition (measurement) actions. These users are provided with corresponding analysis and visualizations including comparison of the efficiency of appliances within the community. In addition, there is a business user community who has the access to analytic data- services.

The OpenFridge platform collects raw energy consumption data and user-provided data from the home domain, stores them within the Big Data infrastructure and processes them eliciting the parameterized model of the usage profiles characteristic for the conditions of the measurement actions. These parameters of the model are linked to the general and anonymized attributes of the appliances, homes, and users, as well as parameters of the measurements, e.g., environmental parameters (sensor- or user-provided) and any other relevant data entry. This linked data are the bases for the data services (for both communities consumer and business community) which are essentially complex queries over the semantic knowledgebase.

A. Open Fridge Architecture The architecture and high level workflow for data services  in the OpenFridge platform is illustrated in Figure 1. In this initial architecture main sources of the data are users and the appliances, e.g., refrigerators. The system integrates the raw data acquisition component, the data analytics component and the data service provisioning component based on the reasoning on the semantic knowledgebase.

The hardware enabling the collection of the raw energy data integrates smart plugs and a flexible web-based interface for access to this data. This product is typically used for periodic power measurement and simple integration and aggregation of this data into the hourly aggregated consumption values which are locally presented to the user.

These measurements run constantly in the background. While this type of measurements can provide the user with some level of energy awareness, they are not enough granular to provide more insight into the inner life of the appliance and to explain some unexpected results.

On the contrary, the OpenFridge focuses on offering the user interfaces and incentives to perform controlled measurement actions in which much more granular data is collected within shorter periods of time. The raw data is sampled with the frequency which shall provide enough insight into the state of the device, the cycle or the program of     Figure 1. OpenFridge A  use. This approach enables simultaneous context and the consumption data withou possibility to add other external data he illustrated.

The raw data are captured within infrastructure, and is subject to Map-Reduce results of the raw data mining is input knowledgebase, which is the basis for creatio services ? visualization and community bui the users  and business intelligence services sector.

Some challenges that OpenFridge platfo addresses are explorative and interactive in data acquisition, assuring privacy of user an setting Hadoop/MapReduce infrastructure deployment as well as analytics on raw extraction and feeding into the semantic kno Mappers and Reducers. Further we address i engineering and management to support grow services [21; 22], as well as flexible design o services for semantic analytics.

The usage profile captured within the semantic repository shows the real consumption patterns of the refrigerator, comprising the periods of cooling, periods of inactivity, etc.

The detailed profiles offer the ground to compare: different refrigerators, refrigerators of the same type, the consumption of the same fridge, at different environmental conditions, fridge loadings, impact of opening the doors, inserting warm dishes, impact of aging, and impact of installation.



IV. CONCLUSIONS The OpenFridge platform presented in this paper is a data  marketplace which goal is to increase energy awareness, aid adoption of new energy efficiency and renewable generation technology, create need for energy management products and services, and build community for propagation of energy efficiency social values. It supports the creation a community of users with easy access to appropriate analytics results. The data-service interfaces towards the energy efficiency data home appliances shall contribute to the creation of new business models and innovative services and products for different types of enterprises.
