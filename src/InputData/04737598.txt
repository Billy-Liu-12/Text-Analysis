An Empirical Study on the Concentration Ratio of Stockholders Equity and the   Corporate Governance Performance in Listed Companies

Abstract  With the 169 listing enterprises of machinery, equipment and instrumentation industries as the samples and by means of the 2004 ??? 2006 data, this paper deals with the empirical relation among the first major shareholders equity ration, the second to the fifth largest shareholding ratio and Z index and the corporate governance performance. The research results indicate that, before the share reform, the first major shareholders equity ratio is not in obviously correlation with the corporate governance performance, but in remarkable correlation with the agency cost, and that the second to the fifth largest shareholding ratio is in significant correlation with the corporate governance performance. Z index is in the significant negative correlation with the corporate governance performance. After the share reform, the first major shareholders equity ratio is in significant positive correlation with Tobin?s Q value and the agency cost, and the second to the fifth largest shareholding ratio is in significant positive correlation with corporate governance performance, but is in significant negative correlation with agency cost; and also Z index is in significant negative correlation with corporate governance performance.

1. Introduction  Research on the relationship between the ownership structure and the Corporate Performance was started by Berle and Means (1932), they held that the company stockholder's rights dispersion degree and the company performance appeared to the reverse correlation relationship. But a formal study was made by Jensen and Meckling (1976), they held that the company's value depended on the proportion of internal shareholders? shares [1]. Demsetz (1983), contended that there should not exit a fixed  relationship between the company performance and the shareholding structure [2]. Stulz (1988) studies showed that there was a curve relationship between the value of the company and the proportion of internal shareholders? shares [3].

The domestic empirical study results on the concentration ratio of stockholders equity and corporate performance were also inconsistent.

Accordingly, the empirical conclusion can be divided into four basic types: positive correlation, negative correlation, uncorrelation and curve correlation. Xu Xiaonian, Wang Yan (1999) shared the view that the concentration ratio of stockholders equity was in a significant positive correlation with the market value of the total assets and book value ratio. But it was in weak correlation with return on total asset and return on net asset [4]. Zhang Hongjun (2000) reached the conclusion that the concentration ratio of stockholders equity was in a significant positive correlation with corporate governance performance by the analysis of the relationship between the top five major shareholders equity ratio and Tobin Q [5]. MingHua Gao, Yang Jing (2004) selected the return on net asset (ROE) and the earnings per share (EPS) to measure corporate performance, and obtained the conclusion that the concentration ratio of stockholders equity was in a basic uncorrelation with corporate governance performance[6]. But the corporate governance performance indicators covering the companies accounting profit indicators, indicators of corporate value and cost indicators should be selected to carry out the assessment of the company governance performances. This paper mainly deals with the relationship between the concentration ratio of stockholders equity and corporate governance performance before the reform and after the reform.

DOI 10.1109/ICIII.2008.293     2. Theoretical analysis and assumptions  Before the reform of equity shares dispersion, there exists a general phenomenon of one big share in the listed companies in our country. The first major shareholder?s impact on corporate governance performance has both positive and negative effects.

The first major shareholder has the higher proportion of share-holding and holds the controlling interest of the listed company. In considering their own interests, the major shareholders of listed companies have more enthusiasm to operate their listed companies well, and must take a certain effective incentive and supervision and restraint methods, enabling operators to work hard so as to maximize the interests of shareholders.

Accordingly, the enterprises have paid much more attention to their long-term development, in such a way that their performance will increase, but accompanied by an increase in a corresponding agency cost. As viewed from that sense, the higher concentration of equity shares will be beneficial to the business. in the case of absolute controlling interest, the first major shareholders will lack of constraints so that they are likely to take advantage of their own absolute controlling interest for the occupation of the interests of listed companies, as viewed from that sense, the higher concentration of equity shares will not favor to the normal operation of the company. There are two main aspects of equity shares constraints of listed companies: First, Shleifer (2000) suggested "the tunnel effect" and he held that in the highly centralized equity shares and in the case of weak equity shares constraint, the major shareholders often took the advantage of affiliated transactions to transfer business interests, at the expenses of the interests of small shareholders to seek their own interests [7]. On the other hand, the study con-ducted by Xu Liping et al (2006) showed that much high equity shares constraint relationship could make the shareholders mutual involved, whereby reducing the efficiency of the decision-making business so that there could be a negative impact on the performance of listed companies [8]. With the completion of China's stock reform, the first major shareholders equity ratio has been gradually declining, but other major shareholders decline in the equity ratio far below the first major shareholders decline in the equity ratio. The share reform made the concentration ratio of stockholders equity reduced and the relationship of equity shares constraint decreased gradually that was, Z index decreased gradually. As the level of Z index would affect the major shareholders? behavior and the company's operating efficiency, the lower is the Z-index, the more it will favor the company's operating. We  assume that there is no "tunneling effect" that the major shareholders are more willing to obtain the increase in personal income through normal operating by the company's performance increase rather than non-normal means.

Before the share reform, the following assumptions can be made: H1: before the share reform, the first major shareholders equity ratio is in the positive correlation with corporate governance performance and agency costs. H2: before the share reform, the second to the fifth shareholding ratio is in the positive correlation with corporate governance performance, but is in the negative correlation with agency costs. H3: before the share reform, Z index in the negative correlation with corporate governance performance.

After the share reform, the phenomena of different rights of the previous tradable and non-tradable shares have been changed so that the interests of tradable and non-tradable share-holders tend to become the same, whereby a corporate governance basis of common interests has been formed. As a result, the managers of listed companies have been converted into corporate valuable managers, to the sustainable development of the company. The objective of the management committee can be correspondently transformed into the maximization of the company, because the effect of changes in the prices of the securities market shares upon their rights and interests can be less than the benefits brought about by its operating company performance. the following assumptions can be made:H4: after the share reform, the first major shareholding ratio is in the positive correlation with the Tobin?s Q value and agency cost.H5: after the share reform, the second to the fifth shareholding ratio is in the positive correlation with corporate governance performance, but is in the negative correlation with agency costs. H6: after the share reform, Z index is in the negative correlation with corporate governance performance.

3. Research design  3.1 Sample selection and data sources  According to the SFC Industrial Classification standard (CSRC), in this paper, the listed companies of machinery, equipment and instrumentation industries of Shanghai and Shenzhen stock in the year of 2004 and 2006 are taken as samples. Finally, 169 companies are obtained. Data from the Chinese Center for Economic Research Service are used to study.

3.2 Variable Selection  The used governance performance indicators in the study by many research scholars are: earnings per share, return on total asset, net profit, the Tobin?s Q value, information disclosure index, agency cost, and relate party transaction, stock profit, stock net rate, stock sale rate, debt assets ratio, How ratio, quick ratio, the growth rate of total assets, the growth rate of operating revenue.

contribution rate can be obtained quickly.

According to a (k) ? 85%, earnings per share, return on total asset, the Tobin?s Q value, information disclosure index, and agency cost, are selected as the measurable indicators of corporate governance performance. These study variables in this paper including the explanatory variables, controlling  variables and Interpreted variables are divided into three categories, of which the explanatory variables include the state-owned stock variable, the legal person ratio and the flow stock ratio. The control variables are taken from the asset-liability ratio and the size of companies. Interpreted variables are expressed by performance indicators, with the concrete conditions as shown in table 1.

3.3 Model Construction  Based on the above assumptions and theoretical analysis, we assumed the regression function model:  )1(3210 ?eELETTSIZEP ii ++++= ????   where, Pi represents the corporate governance performance variables, with earnings per share, return on assets, Tobin?s Q value, information disclosure index, and the acting interpreted variable costs; ?0 is the intercept; ?i  Table 1.

4. Empirical Studies  4.1 Description analysis of statistical variables  It can be seen from Table 2 that the first major shareholders equity ratio of the mean value appears to have the de creasing trend from 2004 to 2006. But there is no change in the maximum values. The second to the fifth largest share-holding ratio of the mean is 16% in 2004; the highest in 2005 to 17%, and reduced to 16%in 2006, which appears to have an inverted U-shaped varying trend, of which the minimum value appears to have an increment trend.

The Z index's change is more obvious. We may see  that the years of 2004-2006.the concentration ratio of stockholders equity is in the gradual reduction.

each net income, the property return rate, Tobin?s Q value and the information disclosure appear to have the upward U change tendency along with the year change, but the agency cost appears to have the downward U change tendency, whereby indicating that the 2005 reform enables the stockholder's rights structure to have the immense changes, resulted in corporate governance performance was greatly improved in 2006.

4.2 Statistical regression analysis of variables  It can be seen from Table 3. that the variable regression results of the second to the fifth largest shareholding ratio and corporate governance performance show that the significance of regression equation is SigF <0.05, indicating that the regression equation is significant, whereas ?3  Table 3.

This can prove that the assumption H2 is established. The variable regression results of Z index and corporate governance performance show that the significance of regression equation is SigF <0.05, whereas ?3 coefficient of agency costs is greater than zero, and ?3 significance is SigT <0.05. Assumption H3 is established. The variable regression results of the first big proportion of shareholding ratio and corporate governance performance is SigF <0.05, ?3 significance is SigT <0.05. But ?3 significance of other governance performance variables is SigT > 0.05 but empirical conclusions and assumptions H1 are inconsistent.

It can be seen from Table 4, the Tobin?s Q value regression equation is SigF <0.05, and ?3 coefficient is greater than zero, and ?3 significance is SigT <0.05.Whereas the significance of other governance performance variable regression equation is SigF> 0.05, and ?3 significance is SigT> 0.05. These show the empirical results can prove that the assumption H4 is established. The variable regression results show that the significance of regression equation is SigF <0.05, and ?3 coefficient of agency cost were less than zero, and ?3 coefficient of other governance performance variables were greater than zero, and ?3 significance is SigT <0.05. Show that the second to the fifth largest shareholding ratio was positive correlation with corporate governance performance, and was negative correlation with agency cost. The  Table 4.

The variable regression results of Z index and corporate governance performance showed that the significance of regression equation were SigF <0.05, the regression equation significantly, and ?3 coefficient of agency costs were greater than zero, and ?3 coefficient of other governance performance variables were less than zero, and ?3 significance was SigT <0.05. These showed that with the decrease of the Z index, and other corporate governance performance variable was a significant increase. This proved that assumption H6 was established. After the reform, the relationship of checks and balances had played a significant role in performance decrease of Z index can increase checks and balances to the first major shareholders.

5. Conclusion of the study  The listed companies of the machinery, equipment and instrumentation industries are selected as the studying samples with the following conclusions obtained:(1) Before the share reform, the first major shareholders equity ratio is not in the significant positive correlation with corporate governance performance, but is in the positive correlation with agency cost. Empirical studies have proved that there exist the ?tunneling effect? in China's listed companies and controlling shareholders of listed companies can harm the interests of listed companies by their absolute control advantages. The second to the fifth shareholding ratio is in the positive correlation with corporate governance performance, Z index is in the negative correlation with corporate governance performance.(2) After the share reform, the first major shareholding ratio is in the positive correlation with the Tobin?s Q value and agency cost. This shows that compared with corporate governance performance, the major shareholders are more concerned about market value of the company.

The second to the fifth shareholding ratio is in the positive correlation with corporate governance performance and in the negative correlation with agency costs. This shows that with an increase in the second to the fifth shareholding ratio, this is was conductive to the improvement of corporate governance performance. Z index is in the negative correlation with corporate governance performance.

This shows that the degree of relationship between the equity share constraints or the checks and balances will produce a great impact on the corporate governance performance.
