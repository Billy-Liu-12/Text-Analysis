Smart Honeycomb Tile for Small Satellites

Abstract- Traditional satellite technologies integrate solar panels, thermo mechanical subsystems, power management,  data processing and harness subsystems together in a late stage  of design. More recently this approach has become inefficient  and its limitation can easily be overcome with modern  manufacturing technologies. This paper proposes an innovative  approach to embed power, signal processing and harness  together with thermo mechanical subsystem(s) and when  required, solar panels. The approach has been developed for  the AraMiS architecture for low-cost modular satellites, but it  can easily be adapted to other architectures, missions and  spacecraft sizes. The architecture consists of tiles or panel  bodies containing solar panels on exterior side and all necessary  electronic subsystems on the interior side. The proposed  approach uses very thin commercial PCBs (0.2 or 0.3mm thick)  as the lateral skins for honeycomb structure. The interior side  also contains commercial tile processors and plug & play connectors for any desired subsystem placement. The  processors implement common functionalities for signal  processing, data communication and control operation. The  interior side can also host power conversion, for an improved  fault-tolerant interface of solar panels with the power  management subsystem. A high-performance power  distribution bus has also been tested, for a distributed  approach to satellite power management. The proposed design  uses exclusively the UML diagrams for illustration purpose and  software handling of housekeeping data.
