Stride Information Monitoring and Sensing in Sports

Abstract?Accurate measurements of athletes? stride parameters, such as stride/step length, stride/step frequency, stance times and foot contact times are important to coaching support and biomechanics research in sprinting. Existing stride parameter monitoring approaches are either expensive, or insufficiently accurate, or not suitable for supporting daily training sessions.

This paper investigates the use of cost-effective, low quality track-side and on-body sensors in a novel way to enable practical capture of accurate stride information of sprinters. It was investigated how information fusion could play a big part in practical sensing systems; and how novel system design could avoid the need of sophisticated synchronisation between intra- and inter- homogeneous and heterogeneous subsystems. The work also explored the importance of linking heterogeneous data streams to support easy information fusion. Experiment results show that the presented system has an accuracy of 1.661? 1.002cm (mean ? SD) for stride length measurements, with 50% errors fall within 3ms and 80% errors fall within 5ms for foot contact time.

I. INTRODUCTION There are several well known factors that affect sprinters?  performances (i.e. speed), such as stride/step length, stride/step frequency, foot contact times, stance times1, etc.

These are important factors to coaching and biomechanics research. Due to the competitive nature of sprinting - the difference in performance between elite sprinters is often within milliseconds ? the accuracy of athletic sport performance monitoring systems is therefore important.

Existing stride parameter monitoring approach commonly uses optical-based systems [3][9]: active or passive markers are placed on different segments of a subject, the data of the motions are captured, and regenerated into 2D or 3D space motion by the system, and the results are subsequently analysed. These systems are very accurate (millimeter-level accuracy [12]) but also very expensive, time consuming to setup, and have limited viewing angle. Thus, existing studies   1 Foot-on is the motion when the foot is touching down on the ground.

Stride length is the horizontal distance between two subsequent foot-ons of the same foot. Step length is the distance between two subsequent foot-ons of an athlete. Stride frequency is the rate at which a stride is made. Foot contact time is the amount of time the foot is on the ground; stance time is the amount of time the foot is in the air.

are limited to small-scale and short-term study. A long-term collection of accurate, fine-grain stride parameters of a large poll of athletes with different physical characteristics, combined with a record of the corresponding training strategies, would provide important data to address a fundamental question in sprinting that are yet to be answered: what are the characteristics that distinguish between faster and slower sprinters?

In recent years, the use of sensors in many application domains has been reported: for example in energy sensing, health sensing, and more. The use of sensors in the sports domain, however, has attracted relatively less attention. The best practice for designing and implementing ubiquitous computing systems for sports performance monitoring was outlined in [14]. A wearable piezoelectric force sensing system for detecting scoring kicks in Taewondo matches was presented in [13]. The use of a network of light sensors for speed monitoring of athletes was reported in [1][11]; the use of radio-based localisation techniques for monitoring the continuous speed of athletes was reported in [8]. Since the performance differences of elite athletes differ only slightly, a sports performance monitoring system that provides data for characterising the performance differences between athletes must be reliable and robust, and must deliver results of a high level of accuracy. Yet, the system must be practical and the monetary cost of the system must be kept low so that the scale of deployment is maximised in order to collect a large data set over long distance runs and over a long period of time2. These challenges raise a series of interesting research questions that have not been fully addressed before in the sensing community: could low cost sensors ? which often have limited functionalities and less than desire data qualities - deliver results with a level of accuracy that is comparable to ones obtained using expensive gold-standard technologies in a reliable way? In a real sensing system where heterogeneous (sub)systems are integrated to deliver useful results, precise synchronisation is often considered as a major issue; but are there any novel way(s) one could adopt to avoid the need of sophisticated - potentially complicated - synchronisation in the system(s)? How could one utilise the idea of information fusion in sensing system to push the limits of sensing systems?

2  Identifying the exact number of data samples needed for  biomechanics research is out-of-scope of this paper; but none-the- less, existing solutions are not suitable, therefore cheap and practical solutions are needed.

Are there other methods that could be adopted to ease information fusion, instead of just combining data together?

The authors argue that sensing technologies - when combined with creative system designs - could provide practical, accurate, reliable and cost-effective solutions to everyday problems. This paper attempts to address the above research questions through the process of designing, developing and deploying a highly accurate, cost-effective and practical sensing system - known as the Step Information Monitoring and Sensing (SIMS) system [20] - which fuses data from on-body sensors and track-side sensors to deliver the full, complete package of stride parameters of athletes. The design, design factors and evaluation results of the integrated sensing system are presented in this paper. A prototype was developed for evaluation purpose; the results are presented in this paper. To the best of the authors? knowledge, the approach presented in this paper is novel and the system is the first of its kind.

This paper begins with an overview on existing approaches, with their advantages and disadvantages highlighted; secondly, the SIMS system and its design features are presented, and the design choices and other possible options are explained. Thirdly, the results of a series of experiments using a prototype of the SIMS system are presented and discussed. Then, the applicability and potential impact of SIMS are discussed. This paper finishes with a conclusion and future work.



II. RELATED WORK  A. Gold-Standard Technologies It was discussed in section I that optical-based systems are  accurate but also very expensive, which makes them far from ideal to be used on a daily basis by coaches and athletes. For example, CODA [3] is an active marker system. Each scanner (i.e. camera) costs ~?20,000, and has limited viewing angle.

Thus, multiple scanners would be needed to cover a long track (e.g. 60 to 100m+ for straights). Also, each scanner must be setup and recalibrated for each training session; athletes must also wear multiple markers. The same constraints apply to passive marker systems such as Qualisys [9]. Alternatively, high speed video cameras (2Kfps) could be used to capture video footage of athletes. The advantage being that no on- body markers would be needed; but these cameras are also very expensive (>?5k per camera). For precise measurements, such as measuring the exact moment and the exact position of foot-on and foot-off (for deriving foot contact times, stride frequency, and stride length etc.), high quality lens and intensive lighting would be needed; the cameras must also be placed horizontally to the track and close to the ground level; but even so, the use of video-based systems to measure contact times is difficult. Due to the limited viewing angle, multiple precisely synchronised cameras3 would be needed in order to  3 To determine the stance time between two subsequent foot-ons,  each captured by a different camera (i.e. when the subject is at the edge of the viewing angle of the camera), the cameras must be precisely synchronised (i.e. frame-by-frame) in order for the time- related parameter to be meaningful. FireWire cameras would be  cover for a long distance, which adds complexity to the approach. These drawbacks make high speed cameras not suitable for monitoring regular training sessions either.

Force Plates (FPs) are the gold-standard for foot contact time measurements due to their high accuracy. However, FPs are very expensive, generally come in small size due to the high cost involved, and must be embedded underneath the lanes. The Opto-jump system is the closest work related to the presented system. It comprises a series of 1m long metal square sectioned tubes which link together. Infrared beams emanate from the tubes very close to floor level, the feet breaking the beams would give the step lengths and times. They are very expensive (US$3K per 1m), very time consuming to setup and must be removed after every training session.

B. Wireless Sensor-based Technologies Sensor-based systems tend to be monetary cheaper than  gold-standard technologies. One of the approaches in the wireless sensing community is to obtain stride parameters through on-body inertial sensors [2]. For example, the use of inertial sensors for monitoring the stride parameters of pedestrian and runners have been reported in [5] and [6] respectively. The speed (i.e. acceleration) of the subjects in the experiments, however, was only half of the typical speed of a sprinter (i.e. 4.72 to 5.28m/s vs. 7 to 10m/s). A wireless, radio- based localisation system for estimating stride length of athletes was reported in [8]. The paper reports that through examining gold-standard stride data of sprinters, a relationship between stride length and the corresponding CoM forward displacement was established; thus, one could obtain stride length by combining the CoM forward displacements of a sprinter obtained through a wireless localisation system, and the foot-on moments detected by on-body sensors. The paper identified that the stride length and CoM forward displacement are more closely related during the secondary acceleration phase, maximum speed phase and the deceleration phase of a sprint; but the two are less related during the first acceleration phase (e.g. when the sprinter is raising from the block at start) due to the differences between individual?s starting technique. Thus, from a coaching support point-of-view, CoM forward displacement is not equivalent to stride length. Thus, another approach should be investigated to deliver stride information to the required level of accuracy and reliability for coaching support and biomechanics research.



III. SUBSYSTEM DESIGN The SIMS system has two integrated subsystems: an on-  body foot-pressure sensing system and a track-side video- sensing system. The former subsystem provides accurate time- related information of stride parameters, such as foot contact time, stance time, and stride/step frequency. The latter subsystem provides fundamental positional information ? when integrated with time-related stride information from the on- body foot pressure sensing subsystem ? would enable one to derive accurate stride/step length.

suitable but at a high cost and high complexity with wires running along the track between cameras.

A. System Requirements and Assumptions A stride information sensing system should capture the  following information: stride/step length, stride/step frequency, stance time, and foot contact time. The system must be accurate at any speed. The system must be cost-effective, that it should be significantly cheaper than other systems, and must be scalable, that its design should provision the system to be expanded to cover longer lanes. Since the track is a shared environment, the number and size of track-side equipment should be minimised so that the disturbance to other track users would be kept to a minimal. It should be robust and user- friendly, that it can be used on a daily basis by non-computer experts. On-body sensors should be small in size, light in weight, non-intrusive, and easy to attach.

This paper defines stride length as the forward, horizontal displacement of the same foot during subsequent foot-ons.

According to the regulations, athletes are forbidden to cross lanes during a sprint [7]. Also, it is assumed that the immediate space on the lane ahead of the sprinter is clear of obstructions for safety purposes. Athletes trains a couple of sets per day, and each set lasts no more than a few hours to avoid fatigue and injury, so batteries could be recharged after a day session; thus, energy issues are not addressed. Security and privacy issues are beyond the scope of this paper.

B. The Foot Pressure Sensing (FPS) Subsystem  433MHz FR transceiver  Pressure sensors  Sensor node  Figure 1 ? The SIMS FPS  The SIMS Foot Pressure Sensing (FPS) subsystem (Figure 1) includes two Force Sensing Resistors (FSRs), a sampling sensor node, a wireless transceiver for synchronisation, and a microSD card. FSRs have been commonly used for foot contact time (and subsequently stride frequency) monitoring: cheap, flat, tiny pressure sensors are embedded into the insoles.

Foot-on and foot-off moments are detected by measuring the direct impact of force the foot exerted on the embedded sensors at foot-on and foot-off. Besides, FSRs are very cheap. The two FSRs under the toe on each insole are connected to a sampling sensor node (i.e. a MSP430 processor) through short wires, just long enough so that the sampling sensor node can be attached to the subject?s ankle. The foot-on and foot-off moments ? represented by the moments the pressure exerted on the sensors  exceed beyond and fall below a certain threshold respectively ? are timestamped by the sampling sensor node to deduce foot contact time; from which, stance time (i.e. the time duration between two subsequent foot-on of the same foot) and stride frequency can be calculated. Note that the FSR on the heel (see Figure 1) is not used because sprinters do not sprint on heels.

(3.4)  In more detail, the FPS system is designed around Interlink Electronics Force Sensing Resistor (FSR) model 406.  These are thin 1.5? square sensors attached at the toe positions on a standard shoe insole, as shown in Figure 1. The conductance, rather than resistance, of the FSRs varies approximately linearly with applied force. As recommended in [15], a current- to-voltage converter circuit is used to generate force signals from the FSR insole. This circuit is an op-amp non-inverting amplifier, as shown in Figure 2, with output represented in equation (3.1). The circuit therefore increases, very approximately, linearly with applied force.  The output is  limited to vary from  REFV  to REFV , where REFV  is the  supply voltage, but the circuit has the advantage of requiring only a single-sided power supply. The output signals generated from the FSR electrical interface are recorded by the sensor node, which is no more than a general purpose logging board.

Data is recorded to an on-board microSD card at a rate of 300Hz, on multiple channels, via a 12-bit ADC (giving 11-bit precision due to half-supply voltage swing). In the evaluation sections (section V.A and V.B), it will be shown that 300Hz is sufficiently high enough for the purpose of the system. The result is an unobtrusive, self-contained system.

C. Wireless Synchronisation in FPS To obtain step frequency (i.e. how often the foot of the  same person lands), two FPSs would be needed, one on each foot. Furthermore, the two FPSs must be synchronised. One option is to introduce a centralised ?on-body synchronisation server?, placed at CoM, with wires running down the subject?s leg to their feet (i.e. where the FPSs are located), which has an accurate clock and delivers sync pulses to the FPSs to drive the sampling activity. This approach is similar to the Xbus inertial sensing system from xSens [4]. This approach, however, is least preferred because of the presence of wires running along the lower segments, which may lead to safety hazards.

To address this problem, the SIMS FPS system uses wireless synchronisation. The on-body sampling node is connected to an on-board wireless module (i.e. RF650 from RF Solutions, a RF transceiver operating in the 433MHz channel) for receiving wireless sync pulses from a (track-side) wireless sync pulse generator. The sampling node samples from three ADC channels at 1kHz (i.e. ~300Hz per channel): data from the two pressure sensors under the toe respectively and sync pulses received through the wireless module. Thus, a common timebase between data samples and sync pulses is achieved.

The wireless sync pulses are sent at 1Hz, which is sufficiently frequent to address the small time drift in the devices.

D. The Video Sensor (VS) Subsystem As discussed in section III.B, the SIMS FPS subsystem is  capable of capturing all time-related stride parameters. The remaining parameter is stride/step length. One may argue that stride/step length could be captured by any conventional video- based systems. To do so, one must identify where the foot is touching down. However, it was discussed in section II.A that, even with high definition, expensive high speed video cameras, one would find it difficult to determine this information unless the cameras are placed close to the ground level, horizontal to the track, and with intensive lighting, which are tasks that are very difficult to achieve in a shared environment such as a running track in a stadium.

Camera-based systems or video sensors, however, are the candidate technologies that are more likely to generate accurate positional measurements than any other systems. The first challenge, therefore, is to provide a means for low-cost video sensors of low resolution that are placed far away from the track ? such as in the roof of a stadium (to minimise disturbance to other track users) - to determine exactly where the foot is touching the ground. The second challenge is to design the system so that even with the presence of the on- body sensors and multiple track-side video sensors (for wider coverage), no precise synchronisation between the video sensors and on-body sensors would be needed. The elimination of complex protocols in the system improves reliability and helps bringing down the cost, which in turn, improves practicability and scalability.



IV. THE INTEGRATED SIMS SYSTEM From existing literatures, it was observed that: a) the  minimum foot contact time of elite athletes is between 90 to 100ms [10], which is a relatively long time compares to the  frame-rate of a half-decent video sensor (typically at 100Hz+); b) during a foot-on, the toe is stationary, it is the heel that is rotating; and c) during a sprint, at any one point, only one foot would be on the ground. Based on these observations, the SIMS FPS includes a 3mm orange-red LED (Maplin, N29BY).

The LED is placed on the side of the shoe at the toe (one on each shoe) facing towards the track-side VSs. and the corresponding LED is turned ON when the pressure measured by the FPS exceeds a certain threshold (i.e. at a foot-on). The LED is turned OFF when the pressure falls below a certain threshold (i.e. at a foot-off). Video sensors are placed at fixed, suitable locations above the track (i.e. in the roof of the stadium), and would capture all the motion of the athletes.

Thus, a bright red dot in the images captured by the fixed- position track-side video sensor(s) would represent the exact position where the foot is on the ground. Together with the camera?s calibration data, one would be able to determine stride/step length, which is essentially the horizontal distance between each subsequent red dots (Figure 3).

Illustration of stride length determination in SIMS and calibration points  The video sensor chosen for experimentation in this paper is from PointGrey (CMLN-13S2C-CS 1.3MP Chamelon, USB2.0) with a maximum sampling rate of 30Hz. A 4mm lens was used to maximise the view of coverage. Readers should note that the presented system is not restricted to one type of technology: a frame rate of 30Hz is sufficient to capture the red dots at foot-ons (i.e. the latter has duration ranges from 90 to 100ms), which is a very reasonable requirement for modern cameras. A video sensor with a global shutter is preferred for shorter exposure. Note that SIMS is applicable in other sports domains that require accurate stride parameter measurements, such as sprint training in football (i.e. soccer), rugby, etc.



V. EXPERIMENTS & RESULTS Some important questions must be answered through  evaluation: a) how accurate is the FPS for foot-on and foot-off detection? b) How accurate is the FPS?s internal synchronisation? c) When the LED is ON, does the LED in the images captured by the VS subsystem standout clear enough to allow the image processing software to identify the LED?s pixel coordinates? d) Can one convert the LED?s pixel coordinates to real-world coordinates, accurate enough for stride/step length calculation? In this section, firstly, the experiment results on the accuracy of FPS for foot-on and foot- off detection and synchronisation will be presented. Secondly, the above questions related to the VS subsystem will be addressed through a series of experiments. Readers should note     that the system?s hardware and software are not limited to those used in these experiments.

A. Foot Contact Time Accuracy of FSR  6000 6200 6400 6600 6800 7000 7200         FSR-Heel FSR-Ball FSR-Toe Force Plate  FP FSR-toeFSR-ball FSR-heel  Figure 4 ? Raw data from FPS and FP during running (>6m/s)  To evaluate foot contact times (and subsequently stride/step frequency), the raw data from the FPS system and the Force Plates (Kistler Instrumente AG, Winterthur, Switzerland) are compared. In running, the heel barely touched the ground or had very short time on the ground (Figure 4). This confirms that the stride length should be derived from toe?s positions.

The sharp increase in each channel of the raw data from the FPS system indicates the ?touch-down? of the point where the sensor was attached, and the sharp decrease in the raw data indicates the ?take-off? of the point. These sharp increases and decreases were detected by finding the local maximum and minimum of the first-order differentiation of the raw data. For each stride, the first touch-down time among the pressure sensors should be the foot-on time for the stride, and the last take-off time within the toe pressure sensors should be the foot- off time. In running or sprinting, the touch-down and take-off from the toe sensor were used for foot-on and foot-off timings.

The stance duration, which is the time the foot is in contact with the ground, was calculated by taking the difference between the foot-off time and foot-on time.

For validating the accuracy of time-related stride parameters of FPS, the FPS and the FP are synchronised, and data was collected from ninety-five strides at different speeds (from ~3 to ~6.5m/s). On average, two strides were collected per trial. The synchronisation method involves delivering a sync signal from the FP to the FPS?s track-side sync server via a BNC cable. Note that the sync server is also sending wireless sync pulses at 1Hz to the on-body sensors; thus, synchronisation between intra- and inter- homogeneous and heterogeneous systems is achieved. The FPS is sampling at 300Hz per channel. The error distributions of the foot-on times and stance durations are shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6 respectively. The standard deviation of the foot-on time and stance durations calculated from FSR is 3.1ms and 4.2ms respectively compared to those from FP, with 50% of the strides having error within 3ms and 80% having the error within 5ms in both foot-on time and stance durations.

Assuming an athlete sprints at an average speed of 7m/s, a 5ms error is equivalent to a 3.5cm positional error, a 3ms error is equivalent to a 2.1cm positional error. These errors are within  the requirement. Note that stride/step frequency are calculated from these time parameters.

Synchronisation Accuracy of FPS The accuracy of the pulse-based synchronisation between  the FPS sensor node and the sync server was validated in this section. Note that because the maximum sampling rate in SIMS is low (i.e. 300Hz in FPS), the accuracy of the synchronisation method needs only to be 3.33ms. The two boards and a sync pulse generator were switched on and the boards? logging started at a rate of 300Hz. A trigger signal was generated, consisting of rising and falling edges at arbitrary intervals, and logged directly into a channel on both logger boards simultaneously. The timings of the trigger signal edges from each board were then converted to a common timebase, using the received pulses, and differenced. From 150 trigger edges, the mean absolute timing error was 0.647ms with a standard deviation of 0.715ms. 67.3% of the edges times were no more than 1ms (1 sample period) different, 88% were no more than 1.01ms different, and 100% were no more than 2ms (2 sample periods) different. This is an acceptable result, considering at     an average speed of 7m/s, a 2ms error would translate to 1.4cm positional error. Note that because the FSR is synchronised, one could work out which step is which even if the VS subsystem fails to pick up the odd steps.

C. Image Processing of Video Sensing Subsystem It is important that the image processing software would be  able to: a) distinguish from a series of images whether the LED is ON (i.e. the capability to separate the images with red dots from those without a red dot); and b) from the images which show the LED is ON, identify the pixel coordinates of the red dot. For this purpose, all the images were then processed by a custom-written Matlab program using the Image Processing Toolbox. Once the pixel coordinates of a series of red dots (i.e.

foot-on positions) are identified, the custom-written Matlab code maps the red dot?s pixel coordinates into real world coordinates (in metre) in order to derive the stride length. Due to the distortion of the lens, the lane of interest would appear slightly bent towards the edges of the images. Thus, the program makes use of the pixel coordinates of a set of pre- determined ground-truth calibration points (the white crosses on the lane in Figure 7) on the lane for stride length calculation.

The region of interest is 10m along one lane (each lane is 1.2m in width 4 ). The calibration points in this experiment are separated by 50cm (horizontally) and 60cm (vertically). This is sufficiently fine-grain enough for step length calculation. It should be noted that calibration is only needed to be done once only per installation because the video sensors? locations are fixed. Because all the calibration points? real-world positions are fixed and known, one could calculate stride length between any two red dots. Experiments over 15 trials confirmed that an area of 0.5m x 0.6m per zone on a lane of 1.2m width is sufficiently fine-grain enough for calibration.

D. Evaluating Stride Length Accuracy of SIMS  0m for starts  10m  1.2m  Figure 7 ? An interlaced picture showing a series of foot-ons captured by the VS subsystem (one FPS on each foot) for a maximum  speed trial  An experiment was conducted at the National Indoor Athletic Centre (NIAC), Cardiff, UK to evaluate the accuracy of step length calculation of the SIMS system. One adult   4 Regulations state that the width of a standard running lane is fixed  at 1.2m.

subject sprints for 15 trials5 (i.e. a total of 42 steps over nine starts and six maximum speed sprints 6 ); the step lengths calculated by SIMS are compared with those obtained by a gold-standard system (i.e. CODA) [3]. CODA ? which is commonly used for body movement monitoring in sports science - was used as the gold-standard technologies for evaluation because of its widely recognised high level of accuracy (i.e. millimeter level accuracy [12]). In this experiment, four synchronised CODA scanners are placed horizontally to the track to monitor the 2D7 movements of the subject?s foot over a 10m region of one lane. The SIMS VS subsystem is placed on the balcony of the stadium in the middle of the 10m region. Note that the further away the VSs, the less sharp the images are; thus, the image processing is more challenging. Note that this setup is the exact opposite to the setup required for high speed video camcorders; the latter requires high frame rate cameras with high resolution lens to be placed close to the track with intensive lighting.

A 4mm lens was used for the VS to maximise the range of coverage; the total range of coverage of each VS is ~15m, but the effective view of coverage of the VS subsystem is 10m because the focus is lost at the edges. The FPS is attached to both feet of the subject. Note that the LED is orange-red in colour; thus, a red spike was used to create the worst case scenario. For completeness, a green spike was used for the last trial and it was observed that the colour of the spike has no effect on the accuracy of the system. The LED is placed on the side of the toe to ensure it is as close to ground as possible.

CODA active markers are placed next to the orange-red LED.

These markers would enable CODA to recreate the foot?s motion in 2D space. Figure 7 shows a series of snap shots of an athlete at touch-down captured by the VS subsystem of one of the trials.

The results show that the system has an absolute accuracy of 1.661?1.002cm (mean?SD) for stride length measurements.

The minor errors are most likely to be caused by the errors related to the calibration point measurements, which was done manually using measuring tape. To further improve accuracy, measurements could be done by hand-held laser rangers, which are commonly used in construction sites. Thus, the result is comparable to the 1cm accuracy reported in existing literature [19].



VI. DESIGN FEATURES AND TRANSFERABLE KNOWLEDGE SIMS provides a practical and elegant way of capturing  accurate stride-related information of sprinters using low cost sensors in a novel way; and its design provisions for coverage over a long distance of straight and oval tracks, in both indoor  5  The number of trials in biomechanics and sports science  experiments is limited due to the involvement of (human) subjects and environment constraints (i.e. a shared environment).

6 Starts mean the subject is doing either a standing-start or block-start just before the calibrated area on the track; maximum speed means the subject starts at 30m away from the edge of the calibrated area.

The two sets were included to ensure the stride lengths are different (at maximum speed, stride length is maximised).

7 Step length is the horizontal distance between two foot-ons; so 2D data of the foot is sufficient for the purpose of this paper.

and outdoor environments. In this section, its unique design features and transferable knowledge will be discussed.

A. Utilise the Technique of Linked Information Fusion The wirelessly synchronised FPS subsystems enable the  collection of all time-related stride parameters accurately. The inclusion of the red LED in FPS enables the exact location on the track where the foot is on the ground to be identified by the video sensors, thus enabling an accurate calculation of stride/step length by the VS subsystem. Only minimum track- side equipments are needed to be installed (i.e. the video sensors in the roof, which is the least disturbing location to other track users). Once the system is installed and calibrated, it would require minimal maintenance.

Differences between different approaches  The presented approach illustrates how information fusion is achieved through integrating data from heterogeneous systems to deliver accurate results that otherwise would be difficult to obtain. More importantly, the data being fused are linked. In contrast to existing approaches, which relies solely on on-body inertial sensors and post-data collection analysis using signal processing techniques [2] (Figure 8a), or fuses synchronised but independent video data with inertial sensors, which creates a challenge of precise wireless synchronisation (discussed in section II.A) and the need of potentially complicated image processing algorithms (Figure 8b), the presented approach (Figure 8c) fuses different types of data together ? in this case foot pressure data and video data - but with the latter being linked to the former. The red LED of FPS subsystem provides a crucial piece of information to the VS subsystem which enables the latter to work out easily the point of each foot-on (hence the corresponding stride/step length), which is otherwise difficult to achieve. Using conventional networking expression, instead of the conventional approach which fuses two streams of data from independent systems, the presented approach provides the much needed interface between the two subsystems, so that the two data streams being fused are no longer independent but related. The VS subsystem can now easily work out when the foot-on moments are (i.e.

the images with red LED detected) and most importantly where  the foot-on positions are (i.e. the pixel coordinates of the red LED, which is translatable to real-world coordinates). The immediate benefit is a significantly simplified and more robust data analysis process with high accuracy. Figure 8 shows the differences between existing approaches and the presented information fusion approach.

B. Enabling Low Sampling Rate The optimal sampling rate is the minimal rate that would  deliver data up to the level of accuracy required. In [17], 21?s was suggested as a suitable benchmark sampling rate in WSNs, using audio codecs rate at 48kHz as a reference. In [8], sampling nodes with sampling rate ranges from 1k to 1MHz was reported. The optimal rate is therefore conventionally considered as application dependent [17].

In this paper, it was illustrated that with novel system design with linked information fusion, low capability sensors of low sampling rate, such as 300Hz for the FSR and 30Hz for the VSs, would be sufficient to deliver highly accurate results.

Without the use of information fusion, one would anticipate the system requires a higher sampling rate (for example, a typical high speed video camcoder or a laser range finder would operate at 2kHz). Keeping sampling rate as low as possible has a number of advantages: less data are collected, therefore less work for the sensor node to do which in turn frees up the sensor node to do other work, etc.; but also - as will be discussed in next section - a low sampling rate system means one could deploy a less sophisticated, less complicated synchronisation protocol; which in turn, would enable one to use less intelligent, cheaper devices such as micro-controllers on sensor node, because no complex algorithms need to be run in real-time for system operation: the use of simple devices that carry out simple operations reduces the level of (distributed) complexity in the system, which in turn improves the overall robustness and reliability, and enables easier maintenance.

C. Evaluating the Need of Sophisticated Synchronisation Protocols It should be noted that a sensing system, should it consist of  a number of sensing devices, would require some form of synchronisation. A number of synchronisation protocols for sensor networks have been proposed, each with different levels of accuracy and complexity, but all existing work require the participating nodes to adopt a common synchronisation protocol (i.e. a homogeneous environment). Also, sensor nodes with an embedded Operating System (OS) for implementing the protocols are often assumed [17][18]. In many existing work that involve multiple wired sensing systems - especially those involving multiple video sensors - precise synchronisation (i.e. frame-by-frame synchronisation) is often a must requirement [16]. It should be noted that in the real world, synchronisation is beyond synchronising devices within a homogeneous system; but instead, inter-system synchronisation over heterogeneous systems must also be addressed. Adapting existing synchronisation approaches would add cost and complexity to the system development process.

The authors argue that, system designers must identify how accurate their systems needed to be synchronised. Identifying the answer to this question would enable one to which protocol is the most suitable. SIMS only requires low sampling rate devices; thus a less complicated synchronisation protocol is used (as discussed in section III.C and V.B). Furthermore, through the use of information fusion and a creative system design, only a very loose form of synchronisation (i.e. a common start such as a 3.3V falling edge signal delivered via BNS cable) would be needed for synchronising the VSs (i.e.

synchronisation within a homogeneous system), and for synchronising the VS subsystem with the FPS?s track-side sync server (i.e. synchronisation across heterogeneous systems).

Such arrangement has a significant impact on the system?s design: even for large scale coverage which requires multiple video sensors at different places along a track, no precise synchronisation between the video sensors and the on-body sensors would be needed because all time-related information are provided by the internally synchronised FPSs, which uses a simple, validated synchronisation method. The evaluation results show that a one-way synchronisation protocol would be sufficient for achieving the desired level of accuracy in synchronisation. Another advantage is that the cost is driven down significantly because less sophisticated video capture devices are used: each foot-on is >90ms, thus a video capture device with a sampling rate >10Hz would be sufficient for capturing the short-live flashes from the LED.

It should be noted that, however, the presented argument does not mean that existing synchronisation protocols are ineffective; but instead to point out the importance and benefits of information fusion, and how creative system designs could play a big part in simplifying the system?s design; yet the system would still be capable of delivering highly accurate results but using less complicated protocols with low-cost devices. The authors argue that these are the major factors for pushing the limits of sensing systems.



VII. CONCLUSION In sprinting, accurate measurements of stride-related  information, such as stride/step length, stride/step frequency, stance times, and foot contact times are important parameters to support coaching and biomechanics research. This paper presents a novel, accurate, cost-effective, practical and user friendly integrated sensing system - which includes an on-body foot pressure sensing system and a track-side video sensing system - that is capable of delivering the complete set of stride- related information of sprinters. The system is expandable to cover any distances of straights and oval tracks. The system uses a novel design to eliminate the need of sophisticated synchronisation, and it is applicable to other types of sports performance monitoring. It was discussed why the system was designed in such a way, and how the design considerations and factors are applicable to fellow sensing system designer and developers.

The presented work highlights the fact that information fusion on data from multiple heterogeneous, low cost, low sampling rate sensing systems has an important role to play in pushing the limits of sensing systems; but ? through novel  system design ? complicated synchronisation between heterogeneous systems is not necessary, yet gold-standard comparable accuracy is achieved. It was demonstrated that - when fusing data together - why one should explore the relationship between independent data streams; the result is a much more practical system with significantly simplified data analysis algorithms and accurate results. The authors conclude that sensing technologies do provide a practical and cost- effective alternative approach to existing systems with comparable accuracy. To the best of the authors? knowledge, the presented system is truly novel and it?s the first and only system capable of delivering accurate stride/step parameters of athletes using practical and low-cost sensors.
