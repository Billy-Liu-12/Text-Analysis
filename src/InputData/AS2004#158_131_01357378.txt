Abstract For achieving the adaptive learning, a predefined concept map of a course is often used to provide adaptive learning guidance for learners. However, it is difficult and time consuming to create the concept map of a course. Thus, how to automatically create a concept map of a course becomes an interesting issue. In this paper, we propose a Two-Phase Concept Map Construction (TP- CMC) approach to automatically construct the concept map by learners? historical testing records. Phase 1 is used to preprocess the testing records. We apply Fuzzy Set Theory to transform the numeric testing records of learners into symbolic, apply Education Theory (Item Analysis for Norm-Referencing) to further refine it, and apply Data Mining approach to find its grade fuzzy association rules. Then, in Phase 2, based upon our observation in real learning situation, we use multiple rule types to further analyze the mined rules and then propose a heuristic algorithm to automatically construct the concept map. Finally, the Redundancy and Circularity of the concept map constructed are also evaluated.

1. Introduction With vigorous development of the Internet, e-learning system has become more and more popular. Therefore, in the last five years, many adaptive learning and testing systems [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9] have been proposed to offer learners customized courses in accordance with their aptitudes and learning results. For achieving the adaptive learning, in many Computer-Assisted Instructional (CAI) environments [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9], a predefined concept map of a course, which provides teachers for further analyzing and refining the teaching strategies, is often used to generate adaptive learning guidance. However, it is difficult and time consuming to create the concept map of a course. Thus, how to automatically create a correct concept map of a course becomes an interesting issue.

Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Two-Phase Concept Map Construction (TP-CMC) algorithm to automatically construct a concept map of a course by historical testing records. In the first phase, we apply Fuzzy Set Theory to transform the numeric testing records of learners into symbolic, apply Education Theory to further refine it, and apply Data Mining approach to find its grade fuzzy association rules. In the second phase, based upon our observation in real learning situation, we use multiple rule types to further analyze the mined rules  and then propose a heuristic algorithm to automatically construct the concept map according to analysis results, which can be used to develop adaptive learning system and refine the learning strategies of learners.

2. Related Work In 1984, Novak [7] proposed Concept Map to    In 1984, Novak [7] proposed Concept Map to represent the knowledge as a network consisting of nodes as concepts and links as the relations among concepts.

Concept Map can be used to demonstrate how the learning status of a concept can possibly be influenced by learning status of other concepts and give learners adaptive learning guidance.

Thus, Appleby [1] proposed an approach to create the potential links among skills in mathematics domain. The direction of a link is determined by a combination ofthe relative difficulty of skillsand the relative values of cross- frequencies. For example, f BA represents the amount of learners with wrong answers of skill A and right answers of skill B. If BABA ff ? , an easier skill A could be linked to a harder skill B, but backward link is not permitted.

0-7695-2181-9/04 $20.00 ? 2004 IEEE Hsu [6] also proposed a conceptual map-based notation, called Concept Effect Relationships (CER), to model the learning effect relationships among concepts.

In brief, for two concepts, Ci and Cj, if Ci is the prerequisite for efficiently learning the more complex and higher level concept Cj, then a CER Ci? Cj exists. Later, based upon statistical prediction and approach of Hsu [6], a CER Builder was proposed by Hwang [5]. Firstly, CER Builder finds the test item that most students failed to answer correctly and then collects the other test items failed to answer by the same students. Thus, CER Builder can use the information to determine the relationships among the test items. Though the CER Builder is easy to understand, only using single rule type is not enough to analyze the prerequisite relationship among concepts of test items, which may decrease the quality of concept map.

Tsai [9] proposed a Two-Phase Fuzzy Mining and Learning Algorithm. In the first phase, Look Ahead Fuzzy Mining Association Rule Algorithm (LFMAlg) was proposed to find the embedded association rules from the historical learning records of students. In the second phase, the AQR algorithm is applied to find the misconcept map indicating the missing concepts during students learning. The obtained misconcept map as recommendation can be fed back to teachers for remedy learning of students. However, it is not a complete concept map of a course, only represents the missing learning concepts, its usefulness and flexibility are decreased.

3. Two Phase Concept Map Construction (TP-CMC) In TP-CMC, the Test item-Concept Mapping Table records the related learning concepts of each test item. As shown in Table 1, five quizzes contain these related learning concepts A, B, C, D and E, where ?1? indicates the quiz contains this concept, and ?0? indicates not.

Moreover, a concept set of quiz i is denoted as CSQi, e.g., CSQ5={B, D, E}. The main idea of our approach is to extract the prerequisite relationships among concepts of  test items and construct the concept map. Based upon assumptions, for each record of learners, each test item has a grade.

Table 1: Test Item?Concept Mapping Table As shown in Figure 1, our Concept Map Construction includes two phases: Grade Fuzzy Association Rule Mining Process Phase and Concept Map Constructing Process Phase. The first phase applies fuzzy theory (Grade Fuzzification), education theory (Anomaly Diagnosis), and fuzzy data mining approach to find four fuzzy grade association rule types, L-L, L-H, H-H, H-L,    fuzzy grade association rule types, L-L, L-H, H-H, H-L, among test items. The second phase further analyzes the mined rules based upon our observation in real learning situation. Even based upon our assumptions, constructing a correct concept map is still a hard issue. Accordingly, we propose a heuristic algorithm which can help construct the concept map.

Figure 1: The Flowchart of Two Phase Concept Map Construction (TP-CMC) 4. Grade Fuzzy Association Rule Mining Process In [9], the Look Ahead Fuzzy Association Rule Miming Algorithm (LFMAlg) can be used to find the associated relationship information embedded in the testing records of learners. In this phase, we propose an anomaly diagnosis process to improve LFMAlg and reduce the input data before the mining process.

4.1 Grade Fuzzification For objective judgment of learner's performance, we apply fuzzy concept to transform numeric grade data into symbolic, called Grade Fuzzification. Three membership functions of each quiz?s grade are shown in Figure 2. In the fuzzification result, ?Low?, ?Mid? and ?High? denotes ?Low Grade?, ?Middle Grade? and ?High Grade? respectively. Qi.L, Qi.M, and Qi.H denotes the value of LOW, MIDDLE, and HIGH fuzzy function for the quiz i.

Testing Records 4.2 Anomaly Diagnosis Based upon Item Analysis for Norm-Referencing of    Based upon Item Analysis for Norm-Referencing of Educational Theory [8], the discrimination of item can tell us how good a test item is. If the discrimination of the test item is too low (most students get high score or low score), this item as redundant data will have no contribution to construct the concept map. For refining the input testing data, we propose the anomaly diagnosis, called Fuzzy Item Analysis for Norm-Referencing (FIA- NR) by applying Item Analysis of Educational Theory, shown in Figure 4. A test item will be deleted if it has low discrimination.

Algorithm: Fuzzy Item Analysis for Norm-Referencing (FIA-NR) Symbol Definition: RiH /RiL:The sum of the fuzzy grades on test item i of each student in the high(H)/Low(L) group.( H=1, M = 0.5, L=0 ) NiH /NiL:The number of learners in high/low group.

Step3: Compute PP P iLiH i + ?= and ,PPD iLiHi ?= for i=1,?, k.

Step 4: Delete the test items with low Discrimination (&lt;0.5).

Table 2: Sorted Fuzzified Testing Grade on Q4 Table 3: Difficulty and Discrimination Degree of Each Quiz As shown in Table 3, by applying FIA-NR algorithm, since Discrimination D4 of Q4 is 0.33, learners? grade on Q4 will be deleted. Accordingly, the test sheet can be redesigned.

4.3 Fuzzy Data Mining After filtering out these useless quizzes, we can apply Look Ahead Fuzzy Association Rule Mining Algorithm [9] to find the fuzzy association rules of test items. The mining process is shown in Example 3.

Example 3:For the data shown in Examples 1 and 2, Figure 5 shows the process of finding the association rules with large 2 itemset by LFMAlg algorithm.

Qi.L notation denotes that the ith question (Q) was tagged with low (L) degree, e.g., Q2.L?Q3.L means that learners get low grade on Q2 implies that they may also get low grade on Q3. The confidence is used to indicate the important degree of a mined association rule. For example, the confidence of rule Q2.L? Q3.L can be obtained as follows.

Concept Map Constructing Process Before constructing the concept map, we can get the prerequisite relationship among concept sets of quizzes from analyzing four association rule types, L-L, L-H, H- L, and H-H, based upon our observation obtained by interviewing the educational experts, in real learning situation. Therefore, we can conclude the Heuristic 1: given two quizzes Q1 and Q2, if concepts of Q1 are the 0-7695-2181-9/04 $20.00 ? 2004 IEEE prerequisite of concepts of Q2, Learner gets low grade on Q1 implies that s/he may also get low grade on Q2 or Learner gets high grade on Q2 implies that her/his grade  on Q1 is high.

As shown in Table 5, for each rule type, we use Heuristic 1 to get its prerequisite relationships among concept sets of quizzes with parameterized possibility weight, which are used to construct the concept map.

Symbol Definition: QiCS : indicate concept set of quiz i WRi : indicate the possibility of the possible scenario of the rule Table 5: Prerequisite Relationship of Association Rule In this paper, association rules generated from Large 2 Itemset are firstly used to analyze the prerequisite relationships between learning concepts of quizzes. Based on the prerequisite relationships of concept sets and the Test item-Concept Mapping Table, we propose a Concept Map Constructing (CMC) Algorithm to find the corresponding learning concepts of concept sets to construct the concept map. Therefore, by looking up Table 5, we can obtain the prerequisite relationships of concept sets of quizzes with the possibility weight (Wi) for each mined rule in Table 4. The possibility Wi is a heuristic parameter of CMC algorithm and it can be modified according to different domains and learners? background. Moreover, the related explanations of the analysis in Table 5 are shown in Table 6. Table 7 shows    analysis in Table 5 are shown in Table 6. Table 7 shows the result of transforming association rules in Table 4 by analyzing the prerequisite relationships in Table 5.

Table 6: The Explanations of Rule Types Table 7: Result by Analyzing the Prerequisite Relationships in Table 5 In Figure 6, the mined rules, Q1.L?Q2.H and Q1.H?Q2.L, can be transformed into corresponding prerequisite relationships of concept sets, resulting in a cycle between concept sets, called circularity. That is, concepts of Q1 and concepts of Q2 are prerequisite of each other, which is a conflict in our analysis. Therefore, we have to detect whether a cycle exists or not, e.g., CSQ1?CSQ2?CSQ1.

Because each concept set may contain one or more learning concepts, we further define a principle of joining two concept sets and then generate corresponding concept-pair, (Ci, Cj), that is, if CSQ1= }{ 1 i na ?  and CSQ2= }{ 1 j m b ? , the set of concept-pair is CSQ1 JOIN CSQ2 = )},({ 1 ji k ba ? , where ji ba ?  and mnk ??   . For example, if CSQ1={a1,a2} and CSQ2 = {b1,b2}, CSQ1 JOIN CSQ2 = {(a1,b1), (a1,b2), (a2,b1)}, where a2=b2 is deleted. The related definition used in creating the concept map is given as follows: Concept Map CM = (V, E), where z V = {Ci | denotes the learning concept, each node is unique in CM} z E = { jiCC  | i ? j, denotes that Ci is the prerequisite of Cj.} The jiCC has a Influence Weight, kIW , denotes the degree of relationship between learning concepts. The formulation of kIW is = k/)ConfWIW) 1k(( kk1-k ?+?? , 1?k?

n, where n is the amount of jiCC .

.

For the CMC algorithm shown in Figure 7, the main purpose of Cycle Detection Process is to detect the unreasonable prerequisite relationship as a cycle among concept sets. The Influence Weight, kIW , denotes the degree how the learning status of concept Ci influences Cj. Therefore, the number of jiCC  will enhance the value of Influence Weight. In the formulation of influence 0-7695-2181-9/04 $20.00 ? 2004 IEEE weight, the Wi denotes the possibility of the learning scenario of the association rule in our analysis. Thus, the educational experts can assign different value of Wi to the algorithm according to different domains and learner?s backgrounds.

Figure 7: Concept Map Constructing (CMC) For the association rules given in Table 7, the process of CMC algorithm is shown in Figure 8. In Figure 8.b, the edges drawn as dash line have the lowest confidences in cycles will be deleted in Cycle Detection Process.

Moreover, Table 8 shows the example of computing the Influence Weight of Concept-Pair (B, D) in Figure 8.f.

Because the Concept-Pair (B, D) has two edges between CSQ5 and CSQ1, we have to compute the Influence Weight twice.

Conclusion In this paper, we propose a Two-Phase Concept Map Construction (TP-CMC) approach to automatically construct a concept map. In Phase 1, we apply Fuzzy Set  Theory to transform the numeric testing records into symbolic, apply Education Theory to further refine it, and apply Data Mining to find its grade fuzzy association rules. In Phase 2, based upon our observation in real learning situation, we use multiple rule types to further analyze the mined association rules and then propose a heuristic algorithm to automatically construct the concept map without Redundancy and Circularity. Moreover, we also evaluate the constructed concept map, that is, Non- Redundancy: the anomaly diagnosis can filter many useless test items with low discrimination for refining the input data and Non-Circularity: the cycle detection process can delete these cycles, which make the concept map un-ambiguous.  In the near future, we will analyze the effect of rules with large-3 itemset for improving the concept map and do some experiments based upon real learning testing records.
