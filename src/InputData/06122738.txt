Lately, the pre-fetching strategies become more complicated in which to support new types of application especially in wireless environments. Due to this complication, new method is introduced where it requires data mining technique to improve the pre-fetching process.  Previously, the pre-fetched data item is filtered using an data driven measurement for data interestingness and the data generated are based on the structure of a query pattern and quantified using statistical methods. The measurement is not good enough to solve the rule quality problems as in predicting next query in mobile environment. In this paper, a new measurement method is proposed to generate new criterion of pre- fetched data items before sending to mobile users.  This method is improved by introducing user driven measurement for user interestingness where it will consider the subjectivity and the understandability of the users.

I. INTRODUCTION  In mobile environment pre-fetching is used to prevent network congestion, delays, and latency problems as in [9], [15] and [16].  Mobile applications store the predicted data item in their local cache and in the remote server for back up procedure so that mobile users can use in future. Pre-fetching is very effective technique in mobile environment in improving data availability especially during disconnection time. It prevents mobile users from any delay of ongoing job or terminate job due to the disconnection and they are free from needing any re-connection. User interestingness is an important criterion in determining the availability of data items where the expected data items will be useful and significant to mobile users. They will expect that the data that available during disconnection time will be useful and important in finishing their job successfully.

Interestingness in this case refers to the existence of power to attract users? attention because of the exciting or the un- expectedness criterion. From [6], there are two types of interestingness and measurement categories. The first type is  called data interestingness where the data itself are having the criterion to attract users? attention. The data items are generated from data driven measurement or objective measurement. The second type of interestingness is called user interestingness where the combination criterion of data and users are required to attract other users? attention. In this case, the data items are generated from user driven measurement or subjective measurement.

In this study, for the pre-fetching process, not only the data interestingness to be considered but also the user interestingness will be considered. From previous researchers, the pre-fetched data items were measured based on the data interestingness. The predicted data items are depend on the structure of a query pattern and the data are quantified using statistical methods. The quantity and quality of the data items are controlled by support and confidence metrics. The interestingness is more concerned on the data driven measurement rather than user driven measurement. The measurement is not good enough to solve the rule quality problems as in answering user query in mobile environment [17].

In this study, a new prediction method is proposed to predict new criterion of data item before sending to mobile users. The new criterion of pre-fetched data items is not only measured based on data accuracy but also will be measured based on the subjectivity and understandability of previous users. The additional metrics used for this measurement are un-expectedness of the pattern and action-ability of the data items. Table 1 shows the difference between the data driven measurement and the user driven measurement.

The difference between this study and the previous study is the criterion of the pre-fetched data items. The pre-fetched data items are generated from an un-expected pattern. The new items are unknown to the users or contradict to the user?s existing knowledge [14]. The data items are available and can attract other mobile users? interestingness in making decision even though they are on moving.

IT & Multimedia at UNITEN (ICIMU 2011) Malaysia  14 ? 16 November 2011      Table 1: The Comparison between Data Driven Measurement and User Driven Measurement  Type of Measurement and Description Data Driven Measurement User Driven Measurement  It captures the statistical strength of a pattern and the underlying data used in the discovery process only. It is more generic and independent of the application domain. Can generate patterns that are objectively interesting but which are still of little interest to the user [4].

Measurement is based on the domain knowledge, believes on preferences of the user. More effective at discovering truly novel or surprising knowledge to the user since it explicitly takes into account the user?s background knowledge.

Metric Used and Description Metric Used and Description Support Confidence Un-expectedness Action-ability  Used for filtering out infrequent rules.

Support (X??? = P (X??????  Support is the probability of X and Y happen together, in which X and Y is the transaction set of user queries and the results of the requested data items respectively.

Measure the implication of relationship from a set of items to one another.

Confidence (X??? = P (X?????? ?.

Confidence is the probability of X and Y happen together with respect to probability of X in which X and Y are the transaction set of user queries and results of the requested data items respectively.

The data are unknown to the users or contradict to the user?s existing knowledge/ belief/expectations [14].

Using Bayesian Approach: In this approach, the degree of ??????? ?? ?	? ??? ??? ??? ?	? defined as a conditional probability ?? 	?|??? ????? ?? holds, given some previous evidence ?? supporting that belief. Given new evidence E, then the update degree of belief in ?? ?(?|E,?) where P(?|E,?)=P(E|?,?)P(?|?) / (P(E|?,?) P(?|?? )+P(E| ?,??  )P( ?|?)) .

The interestingness measured for pattern p: I (p, B) = ??? ?? B|P (?|p, ?) ? P (?|?) | / P (?|? ) [4].

The users can do something/re-act on the data to their advantage. It is also defined as the extent to which a user can get benefit from the discovered patterns.

No specific method to measure action-ability.

Existing measures depend on the applications. For example, measured action- ability as the cost of changing the customer?s current condition to match the objectives [12]. Measured action-ability as the profit that an association rule can bring [21].

The action-ability of the data items occur when the mobile users can react to their advantage [14]. Although the two metrics are independent of each other, majority of actionable patterns are un-expected and majority of un-expected patterns are actionable [3]. Therefore, the un-expectedness is a good approximation for action-ability [14] and [2]. In this study, we use un-expectedness as the metric to measure the user interestingness. By having this additional criterion of data items, mobile users can use them and proceed with their job without any problem especially during disconnection. The un- expected pre-fetched data items are always available and can avoid them from higher expenses on reconnecting to network and problem with un-finished job.



I. RELATED WORK  There are many pre-fetching strategies that have been introduced before. The trend in pre-fetching started with semi- automated hoarding set where they rely on user intervention to some extent [7] and [11]. There were based on observing past  accessed patterns of users and involve in maintaining the user?s profiles. Another pre-fetching approach was designed and operated in specific environments and focused were on semi-structured data such as for location dependent web pages and location dependent data services [8], [16] and [20].

Lately, with the advancement of mobile computing technology the pre-fetching techniques in mobile systems become more complicated in which to support new types of applications such as in wireless environments [20] and [5].

Due to this complication, researchers start to introduce new technique where it requires data mining technique. Existing automated of pre-fetching techniques did not focus on the granularity of mobile databases. They focused on the files such as web pages [22] and [9]. The pre-fetching data item was being measured by the data driven measurement in which the data generated are based on the structure of a query pattern.  The quantity and the quality of generated data are controlled by the support and confidence metric only.

Other researchers concentrated on mining tuples in a mobile relational DBMS environment, however their approach can still be further improved to get optimal solutions [1] and [15].

They also used data driven measurement where the pre- fetched data items were computed based on support and confidence in which the pre-fetched data items are not semantically enough for the mobile users especially during disconnection time.

There are many pre-fetching strategies that have been introduced but from our knowledge, none of them are concerned on the user interestingness for the pre-fetching data items by using user driven measurement.



II. METHODOLOGY  In this research, we introduced two methods using user interestingness in belief system concepts, called Interestingness Relative to One Global user value, (IROG) and Interestingness Relative to Set of Global user value, (IRSG).

These methods not only consider the data interestingness but there will be consideration on the global user interestingness.

The confidence value is treated as the initial belief of the global users in determining the user interestingness values of the local users. IROG refers to only one confidence value, which is the highest value, treated as the initial belief of global users. Whereas IRSG refers to all set of confidence values, which are treated as the initial belief of global users. The confidence values and the interestingness values are used to compare between the data interestingness and the user interestingness.

A TPC-D data schema [18] is used to perform the experiment. The data is generated using random generator given by Transaction Processing Council, for Decision Making as given in TPC-D database schema. The data set consist of five regions, twenty five nations and we choose a sample of part brands. We treat the region data as global data set and the nation data as local data set. Firstly, we make an assumption by assigning a priority index for each nation and region. We assume that mobile users registered their application at local level. Then the nation is assigned as the local level priority index and the region will become the global level priority index. For example, in this case, users are chosen from China and India from Asia region. Results for data interestingness and user interestingness using IRSG are shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2.

A. Results Analysis:  From Figure 1, the confidence values show the expected order pattern and the interestingness values show the un- expected order pattern for part brands. Users from China will expect to order many part brands based on the most frequent ordered part brands before. In descending order of confidence value, after having order part brand B#2, users will expect to order part brands B#9, B#18 and B#10 and so on, i.e. in association rule form, B#2????, then B#2???????and then B#2?????. Whereas after taking into consideration user  interestingness values, the pattern shows that un-expected ordering pattern of part brands. The initial expected part brands are no longer interested to order. In descending order of the interestingness values show that after having order part brand B#2, the users are un-expected to order other part brands, i.e. B#19, B#13 and B#7 and so on, in association rule form, B#2?????? then B#2?B#13 and then B#2?????? Summary of the expected and un-expected patterns for ordering part brands for users from China are shown in Table 2.

Table 2: Summary of expected and un-expected pattern in ordering part brands for users from China  Measurement Used / Types of Interestingness  First   part brand to be ordered after B#2  Second part brand to be ordered after B#2  Third  part brand to be ordered after B#2  Data Driven Measurement / Data Interestingness  B#2???? B#2????? B#2?????  User Driven Measurement / User Interestingness  B#2????? B#2????? B#2????  Similar un-expected ordering patterns occur for users from India as in Figure 2. The confidence values show that there are many part brands that users will expect to order, i.e. after having order part brand B#2, the users will expect to order B#9, B#17, B#15, and so on, i.e. in association rule form, B#2?????? then B#2?B#17 and then B#2?????. Whereas after taking into consideration user interestingness values, the pattern shows that the part brands that initially expected to order are no longer interested to order. Again, after having order part brand B#2, the users are un-expected to order other part brands, i.e. B#5, B#20 and B#12 and so on, i.e. in association rules form, B#2?????? then B#2?B#20 and then B#2?B#12. Summary of the expected and the un-expected patterns for ordering part brands users from India are shown in Table 3.

Local Users in China  Figure 2:  Comparison of Data Interestingness and User Interestingness ? Local Users in India  The implementations are also applied to other users in other nations to see the interestingness. By using IROG, the total confidence values for data interestingness and total interestingness values for user interestingness are also measured and compared.  Figure 3 shows the result of the data interestingness and the user interestingness.

B. Discussion:  From Figure 1 and Figure 2, every confidence value in the data driven measurement gave an expected pattern of data interestingness to local users. The values are controlled by the support and the confidence metrics of the global users. By introducing new method in user driven measurement, the interestingness value will give un-expected pattern to local users. By treating the confidence values as the initial degree of belief for local users, it will generate and produce a contradictory and un-expected pattern in ordering part brands as expected by to the global user belief.

Figure 3 shows the results for data interestingness and user interestingness for all local users in the region. The values of Total Confidence in descending order which are controlled by the support and the confidence metrics gave an expected interestingness pattern based on the most frequent nation for specific ordered part brand. By using these values, the requested part brand from China is the most interesting compared to other nations since users in China is the highest total confidence value. After taking into consideration the global user beliefs, an un-expected pattern of nation interestingness is produced. The initial interestingness of users from China is no longer interesting compared to other nations.

The new pattern using user driven measurement in descending order are contradicted to the initial patterns using data driven measurement.  Summary of data interestingness and user interestingness for the expected and the un-expected patterns for nations in Asia are shown in Table 4.

III. CONCLUSION:  By taking into consideration user interestingness, we managed to generate an un-expected pattern for next interesting items request or next query request for local users.

The un-expected request data items or queries will be more interesting to the users especially if this technique is applied to mobile users. The data items will be pre-fetched during the connection time and will be updated or refreshed when the mobile users are reconnected. Further experiment will be carried out to show that, by taking into consideration the user interestingness values into pre-fetching process in mobile environment, a significant performance will be expected in terms of better cache hit ratios compared to pre-fetching without taking consideration of the user interestingness values.
