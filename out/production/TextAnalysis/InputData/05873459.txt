I. INTRODUCTION In the drilling process, drilling troubles may occur at any  time, such as well leakage, blowout and so on. If not detected early, they can lead to not only the waste of more human, material resources and time, but also the well abandoned and personal injury. Whether we can predict the occurrence of one or more complications, whether one complication can cause other complications, so we can take measures to minimize the enormous losses that complications caused in advance. It is good practical guidance for drilling engineering.

At present, each big oilfield mainly rely on expert system[1] to predict the complication, which has strong subjective initiative and the accuracy is not high. Judging from home and abroad research, in the field of computer technology, we mainly make use of neural network[2-4] to predict a kind of complex situations, but the studies of the connections among the complex situations are rare. Taking many years? well history information as the researching data, this paper studies the drilling troubles happened around and establishes model with association rules algorithm to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the drilling complex situation forecast and provide a reference for further research in this field.



II. THE IDEA OF THE APPLICATION OF ASSOCIATION RULES ON DRILLING COMPLEX SITUATION FORECAST  The main characteristics of association rule mining is to discover the potential associations among items[5]. In the process of drilling complex situation forecast, we consider each oil well as a transaction, regard complications that have happened as items , so as to find out the potential associations among them.

The more similar the factors of geology and engineering are, the more similar complications that have happened are.

Therefore, this article regards the complication that have occurred around this oil well as the research object, and the coordinates of the research object depend on whether the factors of geology and engineering are similar, that is to say, different oil may determine different research object. The next is to generate a library from association rule mining, then, based on the library and the complications that have occurred in this oil well, it is to predict whether the complication that have occurred can cause other complications or not. The last is to analyze the forecast results. In addition, if this prediction is not in the library, it will be added into the library.



III. THE APPLICATION PROCESS OF THE ASSOCIATION RULES IN OIL COMPLICATION  The data format of well history information is not well suited to the requirements of association rules, therefore, the first need is to preprocess the well history information; the following is the steps of association rules mining, including looking for frequent item sets and association rules; finally the result of analysis is to obtain the relevance of drilling complications; shown in Fig. 1.

A   Data preparation stage Data preparation is a process after which we can obtain  the data format that association rule mining process required through data pre-processing. therefore, the data preparation    stage includes three steps, that is the original data?s selection, cleaning and integration, conversion. To gain the data that association rules required ultimately, the specific process is shown in Fig. 2.

(1) Select the useful information in raw data Well history information including well number, start  time, end time, recording contents, recorder and other property were listed as TABLE? shows, of which only the well number and contents is the data that the association rule mining needs, therefore, the first is to select the necessary attributes for association rules algorithm from well history information .

TABLE I.  ORIGINAL WELL HISTORY INFORMATION  well number  start time  end time recording contents recorder  oil Well  A   Drilling to well depth 2181.53m,severe limp and jump drill suddenly appear, the weight of drill was from 850kN down to 650kN, pump pressure reduceed from 17MPa to15MPa.Thus, judging from this, drilling down accident occurred. Drill wells to the well depth 1580m met difficulties, on 18 wipe eyes to well depth 2072.85m (head position),pull out of drill down to well depth 169.14m sticking.

(2) clean-up and integrate the raw data As the drilling situation is not unique and successive, the  records for the same well in well history information is scattered too. That is, the same well in the database may correspond to multiple records spaced by the data records of other wells,  therefore, need to clean up the raw data and integration, the specific implementation process is shown in Fig. 3.

Knowing from Fig. 3, after clean-up and integration, the  form of the data stored in the database is shown in TABLE? .

TABLE II.   THE DATA TABLE OF WELL COMPLEX SITUATIONS  Well number Recording contents  Oil well A  Drilling to well depth 2181.53m,severe limp and jump drill suddenly appear, the weight of drill was from 850kN down to 650kN, pump pressure reduced from 17MPa to 15MPa.

Thus,judging from this, drilling down accident occurred. Drill wells to the well depth 1580m met difficulties, on 18 wipe eyes to well depth 2072.85m (head position), pull out of drill down to well depth 169.14m sticking.

(3) the conversion of raw data Data conversion uses the string matching algorithm,  specific steps are as follows: 1) First, establish a data dictionary, where 10 kinds of the  complex case as an example are used to set up the data dictionary, as shown in TABLE?, in which each situation as a substring named T, and recording contents are the main string named S.

TABLE III.  DATA DICTIONARY  number 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  String T  Wells Bay  well blowout  Well fall  Lost circulation  Pipe- sticking  Gas cut  Barbed drill  drill pipe  falling  Borehole plugging  End bit  2) Second, match each T and S by order, if the match succeeded, that is to say the complication has happened, set the value of the corresponding property of the transaction as 1, otherwise, match is unsuccessful, that is to say the complicated situation did not happen, put the value of the corresponding attribute of the transaction as 0. After data conversion, the form of data is shown in TABLE?.

TABLE IV.  DATA TABLE AFTER CONVERSION  Complication   well number Well Bay  well blowout  Well fall  Lost circulation  Pipe- sticking  Gas cut  Barbed drill  drill pipe  falling Borehole plugging  End bit  Oil well A 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0  A. Establish Forecasting Model for Association Rules (1) Determine the scope of the original data The first step to determine the scope of the original data  is to determine the coordinates of center of oil wells, in this instance, the coordinates of A is the well center; the next step is to determine a radius R and ensure that similar geological    conditions and other factors; the last is to draw a circle so that the well history information which wellhead coordinates are in this circle,is the original data used to build the association rule model  (2) Select the target data In mining Association Rules, only two or more kinds of  complications happened, can this well have good values for data mining, thus, select the records in which the number of complications that have happened is more than two as target data. In this application example, after data preprocessing, we finally collect the data of 1021 oil wells, that is to say, there are 1021 records in transaction database, part records are shown in Fig. 4.

Fig. 4 part records (target data) (3) Establish Association rules model for the association  rules Application of association rules algorithm is the process  of mining association rules, including two steps, that is to find frequent item sets and association rules. In the actual mining process, the determination of the minimum support and minimum confidence is very important, if the value is set too large, some rules we need may not come out; if the minimum support is set too small, it will generate a large number of frequent item sets and a large number of redundant association rules, and spend a long time.

Experienced designers can determine the appropriate minimum support and confidence as quickly as possible after using the prediction model in a long time. In this application example, we initially set the minimum support as 5%, set the minimum confidence as 40%, and use the association rules algorithm that is  mentioned in reference 6 to establish models, finally generate 86 rules after data mining, take some for example, as shown in TABLE?.

TABLE V.  SOME ASSOCIATION RULES  association rules support(%) confidence(%)  Lost circulation => Well Bay 15.3 66.7  Wells Bay + Wells all => drill pipe falling 13.4 43.3  Wells Bay + Lost circulation => drill pipe falling 21.6 83.2  Well Bay => well blowout 10.4 42.7  B. Application of association rules and result analysis Suppose in a oil well lost circulation has occurred,  knowing from the association rules that lost circulation is likely to lead to the occurrence of Wells Bay. Because when lost circulation happens, the drilling fluid liquid will drop, liquid pressure become lower as well, then the ground- borehole pressure balance system will lose when the drilling fluid pressure below the pore pressure, then fluid will flow into the well bore resulting in the occurrence of wells bay.

Wells bay without control will cause the emitted fluid or formation fluid increased over turntable after the above, what we call a blowout.

Thus, there are close association in all complications happened in drilling process. Some strong rules can be mined from the application of association rules, so that we can take preventive measures to reduce unnecessary losses.



IV. CONCLUSION By the way of studying the complications happened  around the well, association rules can predict accurately whether one or more complications happened will lead to others, then connections among complications can be found in time, so staff can adjust the drilling fluid by the concentration of parameters in advance to prevent possible complications, minimizing their losses and impact, and even prevent it from happening. The next research is to combine the forecast from causes and the forecast from complications to achieve a comprehensive drilling forecast.
