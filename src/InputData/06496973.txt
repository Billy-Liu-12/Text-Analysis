Abstract? This paper presents an overview of using a single semantic data model (HELIOLIB) and science data analysis code base (MIDL) throughout all phases of a spacecraft mission from integration and testing to archive submission. By using a single code base to create both ground support software and analysis software, we reduce costs and increase the integrity of the final science data product. The detailed, error-prone task of decoding telemetry is coded only once, and is tested early in the instrument development cycle. Not only does this result in better science telemetry processing later on, but can also reveal instrument or data design issues while the instrument is still on the ground. The telemetry processing code is then encapsulated within a data model that allows the code to be used as a pluggable reader module within science analysis tools. The daily use of these tools (MIDL) by instrument scientists helps validate the code. Final archive products can then be created with the same code base (same jar file even), ensuring that the quality of the archive products is as good as the data used routinely by the instrument team.
