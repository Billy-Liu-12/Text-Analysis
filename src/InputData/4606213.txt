Using Methods of Association Rules Mining Optimizationin   in Web-Based Mobile-Learning System

Abstract   With the rapid development of Internet and Mobile  technologies, Web-based Mobile-Learning System has created new ways for educators to communicate with learners . Association rule mining is one of the most important fields in data mining and knowledge discovery in databases.Rules  explosion   is  a  serious problem which causes great concerned,as conventional mining algorithms often produce too many rules for decision makers to digest. Since Web-based Mobile- Learning System collects vast amounts of learners profile data, data mining and knowledge discovery techniques can be applied to find interesting relationships between attributes of learners, assessments, the solution strategies adopted by learners and so on. Therefore ,this paper concentrates on a new data-mining algorithm,combined with the advantages of improved genetic agorithm,called ARGA(Association rules based on an improved Genetic Algorithm), to mine the association rules from a Web-based Mobile-Learning system. This paper first takes advantage of the genetic algorithm designed specifically for discovering association rules.

Moreover, the analysis and experimenst are also made to show the proposed method is more efficient and accurate than the Apriori algorithm in Mobile- Learning system.

1. Introduction   The development of Internet and Mobile technologies have created new ways and defined new relationships between educators and learners. Mobile- learning(m-learning) inherits advantages from e- learning, but extends research by making use of portable(handheld) wireless technologies [1]. M- learning is the exciting art of using mobile technologies to enhance the learning experience.Mobile phones, digital media players (e.g.

iPods, MP4 players), PDAs(e.g. Palm, Pocket PC) and the Internet can be blended to engage and motivate learners, any time and anywhere.Recently,the fastest  growing web community has been mobile visitors who browse web pages or retrieve web information using PDAs or cell phones via wireless networks.Similarly, the development of educational technologies recently has tended to be mobilized,portable, and personalized.These trends have led to learning forms changing from traditional classroom learning to electronic learning,or mobile- learning.Among these novel learning forms,mobile- learning is effective and flexible;that is,mobile- learning can overcome restrictions of time and space, enabling learners to study whenever and wherever possible [2].Modern learners have increasing demands on their time and are often forced to study in their lunch breaks, in the evenings and at weekends; and to study at work or on the bus, train or in the car. They also facilitate learning where learners can often take advantage of unexpected free time since they frequently have their devices with them.The Mobile-Learning researchers focused on applying distance learning techniques to mobile devices instead of desktops. Learners studied the sequence of instruction developed and experimented by transforming traditional distance education into a form more suitable for a Mobile-Learning environment. HuaZhong Normal University has pioneered some learning systems to provide an infrastructure.The research presented here is performed on a part of Web-Based Mobile-Learning System ,The research of foreign Chinese long-distance visualized teaching model,in this University .

Data Mining,as one of the promising technologies since 1990s, is the iterative and interactive process of extracting desirable konwledge or interesring valid, novel, useful, and understandable patterns form existing and massive databases for specific purposes.

Data Mining means searching for valuable information in large volumes of data, using exploration and analysis, by automatic or semi-automatic means, of large quantities of data in order to discover meaningful patterns and rules.Data mining can be categorized into several interesting areas, such as clustering, association rules, decision tree analysis, prediction, regression, etc [3].In particular, since Agrawal, Imielinski, and  International Symposium on Electronic Commerce and Security  DOI 10.1109/ISECS.2008.223         Swarmi introduced the notion of association rules in 1993 [4] , association rule mining plays a key role in boosting the research, development and application of data mining techniques.This leads to a great many significant technologies and methodologies for identifying association rules ,and association rule mining becomes one of the widest applied data mining styles.Meanwhile,association rule mining has attracted more and more attention of academia and practitioners with applications such as customer relation management,market baskets,economic and financial time-series analysis methods, production process, manufacturing diagnosis, etc [5],[6] .

Genetic Algorithm (GA),has been shown to be an effective tool to use in association rule mining and pattern recognition[7].

2. Association rules and the Definition of Problem   The problem of mining association rules was introduced in 1993 by Agrawal [2]. Here are the general notations and definitions:  I = { miii ,,, 21 ? } ? set of items; D = set of transactions; each transaction T is included in I ; X = set of items from I, T contains X ; An association rule is a pair X? Y, where X ?  I , Y ?  I, X? Y =?  ; The association rule here is an implication of the  form where X is the conjunction of conditions, and Y is the type of classification. Each rule has an associated support and confidence . The support S(X? Y) of the rule is the measure of frequency both X and Y in D.

S(X ? Y)= };:{ DTTYXT ???  /  D     (1) The confidence measure C(X? Y) of Rule is for  the premise that includes X in the bargain descend, in the meantime includes Y.

C(X ? Y) = };:{ DTTYXT ??? /  DTTXT ?? ;:         (2)   3. The Structure and Description of ARGA  3.1. Genetic Algorithm (GA)   Genetic Algorithm (GA),has been shown to be an effective tool to use in association rule mining and pattern recognition. GA is a self-adaptive optimization searching algorithm,and it obtains the best solution, or the most satisfactory solution through generations of  chromosomes constant evolution includes reproduction, crossover and mutation etc.

Here is the general description of this problem:  F(t) = a ? S(t) + b ? C(t)                                      (3) where,a, b is constants,0 ? a ? 1,0 ? b ? 1;S(t) is the  support, and C(t) is the confidence.

3.2. Encoding and the Initiation Population   This paper employs the natural number to encode the variable ij? . That is, the number of the lines of every range in the matrix ?  in which the element 1 exists is regarded as a gene. Meanwhile,the genes are independent of each other. And ,they are marked by 1K , 2K ,? jK ,?, nK ,in which jK ?  [1,n] , j? [1,n] and nK  may be a repeatedly equal natural number.

When the distributive method at random is employed to produce the initial population comprised of certain individuals, the population must be in a certain scale in order to achieve the optimal solution on the whole. The best way is the generated M individuals randomly that the length is n, then the chromosome bunch encoded by the natural number is calculated as the initial population.

3.3. The Fitness Function  Each individual is assigned a fitness value derived from its raw performance measure given by the objective function. This value is used in the selection to bias towards more fit individuals. Highly fit individuals, relative to the whole population, have a high probability of being selected for mating whereas less fit individuals have a correspondingly low probability of being selected. Therefore,in this paper,the fieness function is as follow:  ))()(( 1)(  minmin C RC  S RSRf +?=                              (4)  In which, R is a pair X ? Y. is minS  minimum support, and minC  is minimum confidence.

3.4. Reproduction Operator   Reproduction is the transmission of personal information from the father generation to the son generation. Each individual in each generation determines the probability that it can reproduce the next generation according to how big or small the fitness value is. Through reproducing, the number of         excellent individuals in the population increases constantly, and the whole process of evolution head for the optimal direction. We are adopting roulette selection strategy; each individual reproduction probability is proportion to fitness value [8].

1) Computing thereproduction probability of all the individuals.

? =  = M  i  if  ifiP   )(  )()(                            (5)  2)  Generate a number r randomly, r=random [0, 1] ; 3) If P(0)+ P(1)+?+ P(i-1)<r< P(0)+ P(1)+?+  P(i),the individual i is selected into the next generation.

3.5. Crossover Operator   The crossover operation is not necessarily performed on all strings in the population. Instead, it is applied with a probability Pc when the pairs are chosen for breeding .The crossover probability Pc directly influences the convergence of the algorithm. The larger Pc is the most likely is the genetic mode of the optimal individual to be destroyed .However, the over-small of Pc can slow down the research process [9].Here is the definition of the crossover operator: (1) Computing crossover probability Pc   ? ?  ? ?  ?  ? ???  = 8.0  )()( ))()((05.08.0  minmax XfXf XfXf  Pc  )()(,  )()(,  XfXf  XfXf  ?  ?   (6) In which, )(max Xf  is the maximum fitness value  of the population, )(min Xf  is the minimum fitness value of the population and )(Xf is the average fitness value of the population.

(2) Generate a number cr  randomly ,in which  cr =random[0,1].if cr <Pc,then conducting the following formula [10]: Offspring = parent1 + cr ? (parent2 ? parent1)        (7)  And formula above is properly transformed into the following formula:  ??  ? ? ?  ??+?=  ??+?=  '   '   )1(  )1(  VrVrV  VrVrV  cc  cc                               (8)  In which, 21,VV are both father indiviuals,and '  '  1 ,VV  are both sons indiviuals.

3.6. Mutation Operator   A further genetic operator, mutation is applied to the new chromosomes, with a set probability Pm. Mutation causes the individual genetic representation to be changed according to some probabilistic rule.Mutation is generally considered to be a back-ground operator that ensures that the probability of searching a particular subspace of the problem space is never zero.

This has the effect of tending to inhibit the possibility of converging to a local optimum, rather than the global optimum.The selection of the mutation probability Pm is the vital point because it influences the action and performance of ARGA.hereis the defintion of the mutation operator:  Computing the mutation crossover probability Pm:  ? ?  ? ?  ?  ? ???  = 02.0  )()( ))()((08.002.0  minmax XfXf XfXf  Pc  )()(,  )()(,  XfXf  XfXf  ?  ?   (9) In which, )(max Xf  is the maximum fitness value  of the population , )(min Xf  is the maximum fitness value of the population,and )(Xf  is the average fitness value of the population.

3.7. Termination Condition   When the matching error  0?? or the condition is not coincident, the process will naturally stop.

4. Simulation Experiments and Result Analysis  In order to measure the proposed ARGA performances and accuracy, an experiment was set up, using an intranet network that connects four local area networks (each with ten IBM Compatible PCs of Intel Pentium IV CPU 2.40 GHz,1 GB of main memory),with the WindowsXP and Linux operating systems. Both algorithms were implemented using Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0. The experiment data included the synthetic and real data.

For ARGA,we used 300 individuals in our population.First,we compare the performance of our proposed method with the classical Apriori algorithm.Fig.1 shows the relationship between runtime and minimum support value for both algorithms.As the value of minimum support increases, the runtimes of both algorithms decrease; nevertheless, the runtime of Apriori algorithm is 2-3 times more than ARGA when the the value of minimum support is low.

Conclusions and future work  With the development of Internet and Mobile technologies,Web-based Mobile-Learning System has created new ways for educators to communicate with learners.Since Web-based Mobile-Learning System collects vast amounts of learner profile data, data mining and knowledge discovery techniques can be applied to find interesting relationships.Most association rule mining algorithms suffer from the twin problems of too much execution time and generating too many association rules. In this paper, we foucs on an improved data-mining algorithm, called ARGA to to address the first problem from a Web-based Mobile- Learning system. We have implemented the algorithms proposed in this paper .Moreover,the research presented here is performed on a part of Web-Based Mobile-Learning System developed at HuaZhong  Normal University.The analysis and experiment results are also made to show that the proposed method ARGA runs 2?3 times faster than the classical Apriori algorithm in Mobile-Learning system.

Future work is focused on the evaluation and optimisation of the association rules discovery system implementation.Another important issue is the implementation combing ARGA with Apriori algorithm. So,we will futher generalize our approach to manage the proposed ARGA in other fields.
