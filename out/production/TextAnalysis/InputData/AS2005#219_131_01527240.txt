Abstract:  This paper discusses two patterns in data mining: association rules and sequential patterns, and describes the process to find these patterns by mining historical securities trading database. Through the analysis of mining result, this paper presents the concept and realization of customer behavior model, and successfully applies the model to advance the performance of Internet securities dealing system of CITIC Securities Co. Ltd. The customer behavior model presented by this paper is an important improvement of traditional securities trading.

Keywords: Data mining; Association rules; Sequential patterns;  Customer behavior model; Internet securities dealing  1.  Introduction  With the rapid development and wide application of database technology, people have accumulated more and more data. Storing data with database management system and analyzing data with machine learning method have become the best way to discover knowledge in database.

Because of the development of Internet securities dealing in recent years, securities companies have already collected and stored a large amount of historical trading data. If these data can be utilized effectively, the characteristics and regularity of investor?s trading behavior could be effectively perceived. It is very important for securities companies to improve the service with these characteristics and regularity.

2.  The concept of Association rules and Sequential patterns  The task of data mining is to discover patterns from data. Association rules and sequential patterns are very  important knowledge discovery pattern. [1] Definition 1: Supposing  is a group of articles, W is a set composed by a group of transactions.

Each transaction T in W is a group of articles, T?R.

Supposing there is an article set A, a transaction T, if A?T, we can claim article set A is supported by transaction T.

Association rule is a formal implication: A?B, A and B are two groups of articles, A?R?B?R?and A?B= ?. There are four indexes that weigh association rule: Confidence, Support, Expected confidence and Lift  ),,,{ 21 mIIIR =  [2].

The concept of sequential pattern is the same as association rule, but there are two differences: The relation between data is correlated with time in order to find sequential pattern; The element of sequential pattern can be an element, and also can be an itemset[3-4].

Definition 2: Itemset is a non-empty set composed by item. In general, Itemset refers to an article set in which articles are not in ordering.

Definition 3: Sequence is an itemset in which items are in ordering.

There are two sequences A<a1,a2?an> and B<b1,b2?,bm>, m>n. If a1? b1?a2?b2???an?bn , then A?B. In a set of sequences, if s is not included in any other sequences, s is maximal.

3.  Mining association rules and sequential patterns from historical trading database  3.1. Thoughts  Historical trading database, composed by customer transactions, is a large-scale database, whose each transaction is composed by customer Id, transaction time and stock code item. A random sample is as follows (Table 1).

All transactions of a customer can be regarded as a      sequence ordered by transaction time, which could be called customer-sequence. Usually, a customer-sequence expressed as: ?itemset(T1) itemset(T2) ? itemset(Tn)?.

Illustrated by table 2.

Table 1: Source database sorted in customer Id and transaction time   Customer Id  (Tran_time)  (Stock_Item)      000001?600693  000600?600600?500001 24733 20030625 600800?000002?500001   000600?500001  24735 20030711 600030   Table 2. Customer-sequence in database   Customer  Id   Customer Sequence  < (600800) (600030) > < (000001,600693) (600800) (000600,600600,500001) >  < (600800,000002,500001) > < (600800) (000600,500001) (600030) >  < (600030) >   If customer-sequence of customer A includes sequence s, then s is supported by customer A. Support of sequence s can be defined as the quantity of all the customers who support s. Given a database which is composed by customer transactions, mining sequential patterns from the database is to look for maximal sequence which at least has minimum support appointed beforehand. Such maximal sequences that represent sequential patterns are called large sequence.

For example, supposing minimum value of support s is 25%, namely there are at least two customers who support s in total five customers. From the analysis of table 2, we can see that two customer-sequences are maximal: < (600800) (600030) > and < (600800) (000600,500001) >.

Customer-sequence < (600800) (600030) > is supported by customer 24731 and 24734. Although customer 24734 exchange item?000600,500001?between item (600800) and (600030) , he still supports the customer-sequence < (600800) (600030) >, because the patterns we look for do not always need keeping continuous. Customer-sequence < (600800) (000600,500001) > is supported by customer 24732 and 24734. Customer 24732 exchange item 600600, and he also exchange 000600 and 500001 at the same time, that still supports this pattern because item (000600,500001) is the subset of item (000600,600600,500001).

Customer-sequence <(000001,600693)(600800)> has not minimum support. Although other customer-sequences have minimum support, such as <(600800)>< (000600) >< (500001) >< (600030) >< (600800) (000600) >< (600800) (500001) > and < (000600,500001) >, they are not maximal because each of them can be included in the maximal customer-sequences.

So the two customer-sequences are sequential patterns.

The result is as follows:   Table 3. Mining result    Sequential Pattern with support > 25%  < (600800) (600030) > < (600800) (000600,500001) >    3.2.  Algorithm analysis  The length of a sequence is the quantity of itemset. A sequence with length of k is called k-sequence. Large itemset is an itemset with minimum support [5]. Every item in large itemset has minimum support. Large sequence is a list of large itemset.

There are five steps to find sequential patterns.

Step1. Sorting phase: Sort historical trading database on customer-id (major key) and transaction-time (minor key). In this phase, transaction database is transformed into the database that is composed by customer-sequence.

Step2. Large itemset phase: Mining association rules with Apriori algorithm is used to find large itemset [6-7].

These large itemset group a set L, where L is also a 1-sequence.

Step3. Transformation phase: In this phase, we constantly inspect whether a given set of large sequence is included in customer-sequence. Each customer-sequence is replaced by large itemset that it includes. If a customer-sequence does not include any large itemset, it should be deleted. But these customers are counted in total number all the same. So a customer-sequence is transformed to a set ,  represents a large itemset.

},,,{ 21 nlll il  Step 4.  Sequence Phase: The sequence can be found by utilizing the large itemset through several times of pass.

In every pass, beginning from seed set that is composed by large sequence, we can generate a new latent large sequence.

In the process of database pass, support of candidate sequence can be calculated. So after a database pass, we can find large sequences in candidate sequences, and form seed set of next pass by these large sequences. Before the first pass, all the 1-sequence obtained in large itemset phase      form seed set.

Apriori algorithm is as follows:   1L = {Large 1-sequences}; // Result from Large itemset Phase  For (k = 2; ? ?;k++) do 1?kL Begin  KC = New Candidates Generated from        1?kL For each customer-sequence c in the database do  Increment the count of all candidates in  KC that are contained in c.

KL  = Candidates in  with minimum support. KC End  Answer = Maximal Sequences in ?k  KL   kL  represents the set composed of all k-sequence, Ck represents the set composed of candidate k_sequence.

New Candidate Generation algorithm: (1) Union:  Insert into Ck Select p.litemset1,?,p.litemsetk-1,q.litemsetk-1 From Lk-1p,Lk-1q Where p.litemset1 = q.litemset1,?, p.litemsetk-2 = q.litemsetk-2;  (2) If the (k-1)-subsequence of sequence c is not included in Lk-1 , delete all c? C ? K   Step 5. Maximal phase: Find maximal sequences in large sequence set.

For ( k = n ; k > 1 ; k-- ) do For each k-sequence S k do Delete from S all subsequences of Sk    4. Structuring customer behavior model based on mining result  Based on sequential patterns mined from historical trading database, customer behavior model can be effectively structured:  ? ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  ? ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  =         KPK  c  b  a  SS  SS SS  SS  CBM          (1)  This model is also called behavior matrix. In the matrix, each row represents a sequential pattern. Every element of the matrix is a large itemset composed by several stocks. Apparently, length of each sequential pattern is different, so zero is used to offset the shortness. From row 1 to last row, support of sequential pattern is  decreasing.

Model CBM reveals the maximum probability of  stock?s trading order which customer exchange in Internet securities dealing. For example, in table 3, if a certain customer exchanges stock (600800), we could forecast that the next stock he will transform is (600030) or (000600,500001) through searching the matrix. So customer behavior in Internet securities dealing can be deduced through the model.

5.  Application of customer behavior model in Internet securities dealing The behavior matrix can be applied to securities companies? Internet dealing system. In Internet dealing system, how to quickly update stock quotations of clients is a key problem. Utilizing behavior matrix, customer?s behavior of trading can be predicted. For example, supposing customer A is buying stock B at moment t, if B is found in the itemset  in behavior matrix, the next trading stock at moment t+1 can be determined in the itemset (k=j+1) with great probability. So the quotations of next stock can be pushed into customer?s computer beforehand.

ijS  ikS  Obviously, if the value of support of sequential pattern is different, the scale of behavior matrix is different. Too large scale of behavior matrix will seriously affect the efficiency of Internet dealing system, and too small scale will decrease the push hit ratio. After testing and using behavior model in Internet dealing system in CITIC Securities Co. Ltd?Listed Companies in Shanghai stock exchange?code 600030?, our experience shows that the best value of support is 55% in mining association rules and sequential patterns from historical trading database.

6.  Conclusion  Mining association rules and sequential patterns from historical trading database to structure customer behavior model are an innovative and practical method in data mining field.

Knowledge is strength, and it is also treasures. As a powerful analysis and assistant decision tool, data mining theory and technology have been gradually applied and developed in securities industry. Since China has become a member of WTO, data mining technology will become more and more important to advance domestic securities companies? core ability of competition.
