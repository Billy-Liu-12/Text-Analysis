In this paper, we relax the model by allowing a pattern to be significant during a contiguous portion of the entire sequence. A user is asked to specify the mini- mum GIG a significant pattern must cany over a subsequence of data. Upon satisfying this requirement, the suhsequence(s) that maximizes the GIG of a pattern will be identified. In the previous example, the pattern ( a l ,  a*) is very significant in the first half of S2, but may not be significant over the entire se- quence.

Although the generalized information gain is a more mean- ingful metric for the problems addressed previously, it does not preserve the downward closure property (as the supporf does). For example, the pattern (a,, a*, e )  may have sufficient GIG while both (a l :  *,*) and (*,a*,*) do not?. We can not take advantages of the standard pruning technique developed for mining association rules. The observation that the triangle inequaliry3 is still preserved by the generalized information gain motivales us to devise a threefold algorithm as the core of our pattern discovery tool, InfoMiner+.

First. the sjgnificant patterns involving one event are dis- covered.

Next, candidate patterns involving multiple events are generated based on the friangle inequality.

All candidate patterns are validated and for each pattern which is significant, the corresponding subsequence con- taining the pattern is also identified.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The problem is formulated in Section 2 while our approach is pre- sented in Section 3. We conclude this paper in Section 4.

2 Problem Formulation Let 3 = {a l  : u 2 , .  . . , } be a set of events and D he a sequence of events in 3. We now introduce some notations that we will use for the remainder of the paper. As mentioned previously, we want to discover the patterns P such that there exists some subsequence D? of D ,  where P is significant in D?.

Definition 2.1 A pattern with period 1 is an array of 1 evenfs ( p l  : p a : .  . . ,PI). each of which is either an evenf in 8 or  *, i.e., p j  E 3 U * ( 1  < j  sl).

(P? is a snhpattern of P )  $p> = * o r p j  = p i , for all 1 5 j 5 1.

2We will explain it in more detail later in this paper.

3 F ~ r  example. the GIG of ( n ~ ,  n2, *) can not exceed the summation of  that of ( a , , * , * )  and (*,az.*).

Note that an event can appear at multiple positions in a pat- tern. For example, (al, a d ,  *, *, uq) is a pattern of period 5 and its first, second and fifth positions are instantiated. It is also a superpatternof (a l ,* :* ,* ,a4) .

We found that the i n f o m f i o n  measure [ I ]  which is widely studied and used in information theory field fulfills the first two properties. It is hence used to measure the amount of pos- itivehegative influence to the overall significance of a pattern caused by each occurrencelabsence. Based on it, we devise a novel measurement, generalized informarion gain, to quantify the significance of a pattern within a subsequence of events.

The following is the definition of the information and the gen- eralized information gain.

Definition 2.2 For an event uj E S and a sequence D of N events, le1 Prob(uj)  be the expecfed probability fhaf oj oc- curs at any given position in D 4 .  Then the information of aj wifh respecf fo D is defined as I ( a j )  = log & = - logProb(aj) .  The information of the ?eternal? evenf * is always 05.

In the information theory community, information is originally used to quantify the apriori  uncertainty that an event will oc- cur or the ?surprise? if the event occurs; and is defined as a continuous function of the probability that an event occurs.

When the probability of an event occurrence approaches 1 ,  the information of that event approaches 0. This enables us to handle the eternal event seamlessly. In addition, information is additive for independent events. This does not only provide a solid theoretical foundation, but also offer computational ef- ficiency.

Definition 2 3 The information of a pattern P = (p l  p z ,  . . . ,PI) is the sum- mation of the informarion carried by each individual posirion, i.e.. I ( P )  = L 5 j g I ( P 1 ) .

Definition 2.4 Given a paffern P = (p1 :y2: . . . , p l )  with pe- riod 1 anda sequence of l events D? = d l ,  dz, . . . , d,, we say that D? is in compliance with P at position j (1 5 j 5 1) i f l eifherpj = * o r p j  = d j  holds.

For example. the sequence a l ,  nl, u p ,  n3 is in compliance with the pattern (a,, u., a3,  *) at positions 1 and 4.

Definition 2.5 Given a pattern P = (p1 pa, . . . , p t )  with pe- riod 6 and a sequence of l evenfs D? = dl , d z ,  . . . ~ dt, we say that P matches D? (or D? supports P),  i f D ?  is in compliance w i rhPa teverypos i f ion j (1  5 j  51).

4For the s&e of simplicity of exploration. we assume that, without addi- tional qualification, aj KCUTS equally likely at any position with probability Piob(aj). All results presented in this paper can be modified to apply to a more gcneral scenario.

SAno!her way of looking at it is that Piob(*) = 1 at any time.

For instance, the sequence al a4;  a*, as ,  aq supports the pattern (al,a4,*,:;a4) while the sequence alraq;a2;a3,ae does not support it since the sequence is not in compliance with the pattern on the last position.

Definition 2.6 Given a parrern P with period I and a se- quence D of N ( N  2 I )  evenrs: d l ,dz ,  . . . ;  dN, the support of P within D is the number of subsequences  drxj+c that support P.

Intuitively, the event sequence can be viewed as a list of segments, each of which consists of 1 contiguous events. There would be LN/I] full segments, among which the segment that P matches will count for the support of P.

Definition 2.1 Given a pattern P = (PI, p riod 1 and a sequence of 1 events D' = information loss of D' on position j with respect to P is the information of the event p j  iff D' is nor in compliance with P at position j and there is no information loss otherwise. The overall information loss of D' with respect to P is the summa- tion of the information loss of each position.

Definition 2.8 Given a partern P with p e n c e  D of N(N 2 I )  events: d l , d z mation loss of D with respect to P is the summation of the information loss of each segment drxj+i dix  j + a : .  . . ~ drxj+r with respect to P.

the support of P within D, and the information loss of D with respect to P ,  respectively.

In a subsequence, the first match of a paltern is viewed as an example, and only subsequent matches contribute to the gen- eralized information gain6.

Definition 2.9 Given a pattern P, a sequence D and a gen- eralized information gain threshold 9. ifthere exists a subse- quence D' of D so that the generalized informarion gain of D' with respect to P is at least y, then P is a valid pattern.

Theoretically, the period of a valid pattern could be arbitrary, i.e., as long as the event sequence. In reality, a user can specify an upperbound of period length according to hidher domain knowledge. As a result, we use L,,, to denote the maximum period allowed fora pattern. However, L,,, can be arbitrarily large, e.g., ranging to several thousands. Now we can rephrase our problem model by employing the generalized information gain metric. For a sequence of events D, an information gain threshold y, and a period bound L,,,, we want to discovery all valid patterns P whose period is less than L,,,. In addi- tion, for each valid pattern P, we want to find the subsequence  'Since we aim at mining penodic patterns. only repeated wcurence~ of  a paltern are used to ~ C C E U I I U I I C  the generalized informstion gain.

which maximizes the generalized information gain of P. In the remainder of this section, we give some more definitions which enable us to present our approach and communicate to readers more effectively.

Definition2.10 For any hvo parterns P = (plrpz2;. . . ,pr ) and P' = (pi  p ;  . . . p i )  of the same period 1. P and P' are complementary ifeither p ,  = : or p i  = *for  all 1 5 j 5 1.

A set of patterns of the same period are said to be comple- menrary if every pair of patterns in the set are complementary.

Definition 2.11 Given a set II of complemenrary patterns of the same period 1, the minimum common superpattern (MCSP) of n is the pattern P of period I ,  which satisfies the following WO conditions.

Each pattern in lI is a subpartern of P.

There does not exist (I subparrern P' of P (P' # P )  such that each patrern in Il is also a subpattern of P'.

It follows from the definition that the information of the MCSP of a set. II. of complementary patterns is the summa- tion of the information of each pattern i n n .

For a given event segment D' = dl d2 ~ . . . ~ dt and a set, II, of complementary patterns, the information loss of D' with respect to the MCSP of Il satisfies the following equalily  where LD(P)  is the information loss of D' with respect to P.

The rationale is that if D' is not in compliance with a pattern P in n on position j. then the j th position must be instantiated and D' must not be in compliance with the MCSP of lI on position j either. In general, for any event sequence D, the overall information loss of D with respect to the MCSP of a set of complementary patterns II is equal to the summation of the information loss of D with respect to each pattern in II.

Definition 2.12 A pattern P = (PI: p~:. . . ,PI) is a singular pattern ifon/y one position is instantiated.

Intuitively, a singular pattern of period 1 consists one regular event and 1 - 1 eternal events. The event may occur at one of the 1 positions. For example, (a:  :, :), ( : ;a ,  *), and ( * ; * : a ) are all singular patterns of period 3 involving event a.

Proposition 2.1 (Triangle Inequality) Given an event se- quence D and two complementary patterns P and P' of the same period, /er Q be the minimum common superpattern of P nnd P'. Then the generalized information gain of D with respecr to Q is at most the summation of that of P and P'.

Proposition 2.1 can be easily generalized IO a set of comple- mentary patterns, which is stated as follows.

Proposition 2.2 Given an evenr sequence D and a ser of com- plementary parrerns n, ler Q be rhe minimum common super parrern of n, then the generalized information gain of D with respect to Q is ar most the summation of rhar of each pattern in n.

3 General Approach In this section, we outline the general strategy we use to mine patterns that meet certain generalized information gain thresh- old y. There exist three challenges for mining patterns with information gain: (I) The number of different patterns is  (I 3 11 -1) = O(l 5 I'"==) O<lSL"%*=  where I S I and L,,, are the overall number of distinct events and the maximum period length, respectively. Since L,,, can be quite large, e.g., in the thousands, it is infeasible to verify each pattern against the data directly. Some pruning mecha- nism has to he developed to circumscribe the search space. (2) By definition, the generalized information gain measure does not have the property of downward closure as the traditional suppon measure does. This prevents us from borrowing ex- isting algorithms developed for association rule problems to mine the qualified patterns. (3) The subsequence concept in- troduced in this paper poses a difficult challenge to determine when a subsequence should start and end. If a pattern misses some "matches", it is hard to tell whether this signals the end of a subsequence or this merely means some noise within a subsequence.

Fortunately, the triangle inequalify holds for the general- ized information gain. In other word, for a set of comple- mentary patterns Il, the generalized information gain of the minimum common superpattern (MCSP) of II is always less than or equal to the sum of that of each individual pattern in II over the same subsequence of events. Inspired by this ohser- vation, we can first collect the generalized information gain of all singular patterns, and then generate candidate patterns by combining these singular patterns.

In the first phase, the valid singular patterns are discovered.

The second phase generates the candidates of valid complex pattern based on the candidates of valid singular patterns via triangle inequality. Finally, InfoMiner+ verifies all candidates, and finds the corresponding subsequence for each valid pat- tern so as to maximize its generalized information gain. The first phase can be further divided into two steps: ( I )  identify the likely periods for each event and (2) find the valid singular pattern for each likely period. In the first step, the negative impact of gap penalties towards the overall GIG is taken into account to prune out disqualified periods of each event; while in the second step all possible format of singular patterns are considered and evaluated. For each likely period 1 of event a ,  there are 1 possible singular patterns, e.g.. for 1 = 3. the  threesingularpatternsare ( a , * : * ) .  (*:a,*),and ( * , * , a ) .  Af- Ler valid singular patterns are identified, the candidate complex patterns are generated according to the triangle inequality, and then verified. At the same time, for each significant pattern, we will find its associated subsequences. Due lo space limitations, we omit the detailed description of the InfoMiner+ algorithm.

4 Conclusion In this paper, we propose a new mining problem of partial pe- riodic pattern with random replacement. To qualify signifi- cant patterns in a sequence, we introduce a new measurement generalized information gain. This new metric can seam- lessly accommodate the different frequency of event occur- rences in an event sequence and the gap penalties and provides us with solid theoretical foundations. The triangle inequality preserved by the generalized information gain enables us to devise a linear algorithm to mine the significant pattern in any subsequence combinations.
