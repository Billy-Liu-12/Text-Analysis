It is predicted that, by 2020, there will be 50 to 100 billion devices connected to the Internet, and these devices will be capable of generat- ing big data in need of analysis to enhanced decision making, insight discovery, and process optimization. As a result, IoT and big data have the potential to revolutionize the whole telecommunication industry.

Nevertheless, business and IT executives are also gradu- ally learning through harsh experience that big data inevitably brings big security headaches. One example is the crowdsourc- ing, in which it is essential to aggregate data from a crowd of users to get true facts or consensus opinions. In the sce- nario, some attacks could be launched by internal and/or external adversaries. As a result, the crowdsourced data could be suffered from the ubiquitous message injection/modification attacks. Furthermore, along with data getting big data, it is sig- nificantly challenging to identify true and valuable data from the large-scale and heterogeneous ones. Therefore, it is undeni- able that the security issues in the crowdsourcing are magnified by big data. Although traditional security mechanisms are plentiful today, they are inadequate to solve the big security challenges in big data era, as they are tailored to securing small-scale or isomorphic data.

The response to our Calls for Papers on this Special Issue was overwhelming, with 34 papers submitted from around the world. During the review process, each paper was assigned to and reviewed by multiple experts in the relevant areas, with a rigorous two-round review process.

Thanks to the courtesy of the Editor-in-Chief of this JOURNAL, Dr. X. Shen, we are able to accept ten excellent arti- cles covering various aspects of big security challenges in big data era. We are also glad to note that many authors of these papers have industry background. In the follow- ing, let us introduce these papers and highlight their main contributions.

In ?Data Exfiltration From Internet of Things Devices: iOS Devices as Case Studies,? the authors use iOS devices as case studies and highlight the potential for pairing mode in iOS devices (which allows the establishment of a trusted relation- ship between an iOS device and a personal computer) to be exploited for covert data exfiltration. In their three case stud- ies, the authors demonstrate how an attacker could exfiltrate   data from a paired iOS device by abusing a library and a command line tool distributed with iTunes. With the aim of avoiding similar attacks in the future, the authors present two recommendations.

1) In order to achieve a more fine-grained restriction that is not just limited to paired computers, Apple should pro- vide mechanisms that allow users to selectively authorize a client software to access device resources on the user?s behalf.

2) Users should practice security hygiene.

Location-based services (LBS), which are a general class  of computer program-level services that use location data to control features, and the polygons spatial query, which can provide more flexible LBS. In ?Efficient and Privacy- Preserving Polygons Spatial Query Framework for Location- Based Services,? the authors investigate this challenging topic.

Specifically, the authors present an efficient and privacy- preserving polygons spatial query framework for LBSs, called Polaris, and an efficient special polygons spatial query algo- rithm over ciphertext is constructed. Polaris can search outsourced encrypted LBS data in cloud server by the encrypted request, and respond the encrypted polygons spa- tial query results accurately. Detailed security analysis shows that the proposed Polaris can resist various known security threats. In addition, performance evaluations via implement- ing Polaris on smartphone and workstation with real LBS dataset demonstrate Polaris? effectiveness in term of real environment.

Affording secure and efficient big data aggregation meth- ods are very attractive in the field of wireless sensor networks research. In ?A Secure and Efficient ID-Based Aggregate Signature Scheme for Wireless Sensor Networks,? the authors focus on data integrity protection and give an identity-based aggregate signature scheme with a designated verifier for wireless sensor networks. According to the advantage of aggregate signatures, the proposed scheme not only can keep data integrity, but also can reduce bandwidth and storage cost for wireless sensor networks. Furthermore, the security of identity-based aggregate signature scheme is rigorously presented based on the computational Diffie?Hellman assump- tion in the random oracle model.

In ?A Privacy-Preserving Data Sharing Framework for Smart Grid,? the authors propose a framework to share data in smart grid by leveraging new advances in homomorphic encryption and proxy re-encryption. The proposed frame- work allows energy resources to analyze consumer data while ensuring consumer privacy. An additional benefit of this frame- work is that consumer data is transmitted over the smart grid only once. Furthermore, the authors present a concrete  See http://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/rights/index.html for more information.

In ?An Efficient and Fine-Grained Big Data Access Control Scheme With Privacy-Preserving Policy,? the authors pro- pose an efficient and fine-grained big data access control scheme with privacy-preserving policy. Specifically, they hide the whole attribute (rather than only its values) in the access policies. To assist data decryption, the authors also design a novel Attribute Bloom Filter to evaluate whether an attribute is in the access policy and locate the exact position in the access policy if it is in the access policy. Security analysis and performance evaluation show that the proposed scheme can preserve the privacy from any linear secret-sharing schemes access policy without employing much overhead.

Mobile crowdsourcing enables a task owner to obtain data from a large number of smartphone users, and further perform data analysis on the aggregated data. In ?Privacy- Preserving Verifiable Set Operation in Big Data for Cloud- Assisted Mobile Crowdsourcing,? the authors propose to use cloud to compute set operation for the requester, at the same time workers? data privacy and identities privacy are well pre- served. Besides, the requester can verify the correctness of set operation results. The authors also extend their scheme to support data preprocessing, with which invalid data can be excluded before data analysis. By using batch verification and data update methods, the proposed scheme greatly reduces the computational cost. Extensive performance analysis and experiment-based on real cloud system have shown both the feasibility and efficiency of proposed scheme.

In ?SPFM: Scalable and Privacy-Preserving Friend Matching in Mobile Cloud,? the authors propose a novel Scalable and Privacy-Preserving Friend Matching protocol, or SPFM in short, which aims to provide a scalable friend matching and recommendation solutions without revealing the users personal data to the cloud. Different from the previous works which involves multiple rounds of protocols, SPFM presents a scalable solution which can prevent honest-but- curious mobile cloud from obtaining the original data and support the friend matching of multiple users simultaneously.

The authors give detailed feasibility and security analysis on SPFM and its accuracy and security have been well demon- strated via extensive simulations. The result shows that the proposed scheme works even better when original data is large.

IoT is a typical complex macrosystem, and the security of the IoT is of course a very complex problem. In ?General Theory of Security and a Study Case in Internet of Things,? the authors study the problems of ?security meridian-collateral? and ?security confrontation? systematically, they give the reachable theoretical limitation of the attack ability of hacker and the defend ability of honker precisely.

In ?A Secure Mechanism for Big Data Collection in Large Scale Internet of Vehicle,? the authors propose a secure mech- anism for big data collection in large scale IoV for improved security performance and efficiency. To begin with, vehicles need to register in the big data center to connect into the network. Afterward, vehicles associate with big data center via mutual authentication and single sign-on algorithm. Two different secure protocols are proposed for business data and confidential data collection. The collected big data is stored securely using distributed storage. The discussion and perfor- mance evaluation result shows the security and efficiency of the proposed secure mechanism.

Last but not least, in ?Privacy-Preserving Ride Sharing Scheme for Autonomous Vehicles in Big Data Era,? the authors propose a scheme to organize ride sharing and address the unique privacy issues. This scheme uses a similarity mea- surement technique over encrypted data to preserve the privacy of trip data. The ride sharing region is divided into cells and each cell is represented by one bit in a binary vector. Each user should represent trip data as binary vectors and submit the encryptions of the vectors to a server. The server can measure the similarity of the users? trip data and find users who can share rides without knowing the data. The proposed scheme can organize ride sharing without disclosing private information.
