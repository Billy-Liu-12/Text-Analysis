Abstract?This paper proposes an antenna selection algorithm for Mars Exploration Rover (MER), where MER can autonomously  select which antenna to use between X- band Direct-To-Earth (DTE) and UHF for communication according  to its constrains and limitation to effectively use their resources and thereby increase data return. When MER selects a path for communication, it simultaneously selects an antenna for transmission of data to earth.
