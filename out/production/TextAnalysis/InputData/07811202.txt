Abstract?Association link network (ALN) can organize massive web information to provide many intelligent services in the era  of Big Data. Effective semantic layered technology not only can provide theoretical support for knowledge discovery in Web  resources, but also can improve the searching efficiency of the related information system such as Web information system and  industrial information system. How to realize the layer division of association semantic by the hierarcy analysis of ALN is an  important research topic. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a hierarchy-cutting model of association semantic. First,  some experiments of four types of keywords with different linking roles are conducted to discover the possible distribution law.

Experimental results show that these keywords with association role reveal previous power-law distribution. Then, based on the  discovered power-law distribution, up-cutting and down-cutting points are presented to divide the association semantic into  three layers. At the same time, the theories of hierarcy-cutting model are presented. Finally, the examples of the current core  topic and permernent topics belonging to a domain are given. The experiments show that hierarcy-cutting points have high  accuracy. The multilayer theory of association semantic can provide a theoretical support for knowledge recommendation with  different particle sizes on ALNs.

?????????? ? ??????????  1 INTRODUCTION  eb information contains plentiful, significant  knowledge including explicit and implicit knowledge  [1]. How to organize the Web information for  facilitating knowledge discovery has been deeply investigated  by some researchers. Association link network (ALN) is a kind  of semantic link network built by mining the association  relations among Web resources for effectively supporting Web  intelligent application such as Web semantic association  search, Web knowledge discovery, and recommendation [2, 3].

Xu et al. have studied on cloud environment for surveillance  data management using video structural description [4],  generating temporal semantic context of concepts [5]. Zhu et  al. present discovering and learning communities and  emerging semantics in semantic link network [6]. With the  rapid development of information technology, human kinds  are more likely to read and share information by similar  intelligent applications. For example, the distributed and  collaborative learning [7], semantic representation of scientific  documents for supporting e-learning [8], discovering and  searching of correlation between shared resources [9], and  smart component technologies for human-centric computing  [10], etc.

Based on the research about ALN, this paper explores the  hierarchy-cutting model of association semantic by network  analysis on the keyword-layer ALN. The model not only can  provide theoretical support of domain topic (or say it as a kind  of knowledge) discovery, recommendation on different  particles/layers for users, but also can improve the searching  efficiency based on ALN. The significant contributions of this  paper are as follows: ? The discovery of power-law distribution of three  types of keywords with association linking role. According to the role of association semantic link (ASL), two kinds of basic semantic features are defined. Further, ASLs are extracted on a given support and changing supports to compute the distribution of the three kinds of keywords with association role. The keywords with association semantic rolereveal obvious power-law distribution characteristic.

? The presentation of hierarchy-cutting model of  association semantic. Based on the power-law distribution of association keywords, the basic idea of hierarchy-cutting model is presented by finding the up-cutting point and down- cutting point. And some corollaries about three-layer association semantic are presented. Top-layer association semantic is refined, which can improve the searching efficiency. And the bottom-layer association semantic can provide more details for user?s information requirements including query and browsing.

In addition, based on the proposed model, some examples  of the current core topic and permanent topics belonging to a  domain are given. To our knowledge, the multilayer method of  association semantic has not been well studied in the existing  work.

2 RELATED WORK This section reviews two related works. One is the semantic  representation and extracting semantic links. The other is  about network analysis.

First, the semantic representation of a scientific document is  proposed to generate the interconnection of the merged SRDFs  belonging to one domain, which can be reflected by keywords'  relations and their weights [11]. Luo et al. propose the  extracting method of domain keywords of text for text  classifying, clustering, and personalized services [12].

Recently, power series representation (PSR) model [13] is  proposed, which has a lower computational complexity than  latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). Also, it contains more  knowledge than vector space model (VSM).

In links/rules extracting, the algorithm of significant  association rules between the items in the database is  presented, which incorporates buffer management and novel  estimation and pruning techniques [14]. The proposed relation  extraction method mines generalized associations of semantic  relations conveyed by the textual content of Web documents  [15]. Xu et al. mine and annotate a semantic relation with  temporal, concise, and structured information, which can  release the explicit, implicit, and diversity semantic relations  between entities [16]. These links have been widely applied in  many fields such as co-experiencing in multiple spaces in  lifetime [17] and organizing multimedia Big Data [18]. Andrei  et al. have explored the graph structure in the Web, and found  the power-law of degree distribution [19]. Ordinarily, the  connection topology is assumed to be either completely  regular or completely random. To interpolate between regular  and random networks [20], with the help of recursion relations  derived from the self-similar structure, Zhang et al. obtain the  solution of average path length [21]. A theoretical approach for  metric properties of uncorrelated random networks with  hidden variables was presented. The approach was applied to  calculate the exact expression for average path length in  random networks [22]. It is commonly known that there exist  short paths between vertices in a network showing the small-  world effect [23]. Yet vertices, for example, the individuals  living in society, usually are not able to find the shortest paths,  due to the very serious limit of information. To theoretically  study this issue, here the navigation process of launching  messages toward the designated targets is investigated on a  variant of the one-dimensional small-world network (SWN)  [24]. Recently, some researchers have explored the spatial  patterns of close relationships across the lifespan [25].

To our knowledge, the existing technologies on association  semantic network cannot efficiently support the analysis of  domain topic in large-scale Web pages because of two basic  issues: 1) The existing methods fall short of multiple-layer  model of large-scale Web resources for supporting the  discovery of domain topic. 2) The existing network analysis  mainly focuses on the characteristic analysis; there is no  method or algorithm of division of association semantic to  satisfy different users? information requirement. In this paper,  we focus on how to realize the hierarchy-cutting of association  semantic for analyzing the domain topic.

3 THE BASIC SEMANTIC FEATURE OF KEYWORDS IN ASL  In this section, two basic semantic features are presented to  analyze the semantic association tendency of keywords.

Further, all keywords in ALN are divided into four types of  keywords with different association roles. Note that these  keywords are domain keywords, which are extracted by the  prior extracting method from Web resources [2].

3.1 Two basic semantic features  Definition 1: Active Traction Feature of Keyword (ATF)  Active Traction Feature of Keyword (ATF) is a kind of  semantic feature, which is owned by antecedent keyword in a  keyword-level ASL. In our research, a keyword with active  traction feature must satisfy the following two conditions:  ? A keyword mk with ATF must be extracted from a  domain Web resource on a given time window. This can ensure that this keyword can be used as an element of representing the domain knowledge.

? The keyword must be used as an antecedent keyword  occurring in one or more ASLs.

This type of semantic feature comes from two types of  knowledge. One is the well-known knowledge, which is  human?s association cognitive sense hidden in the human mind.

For example, association link {?insulin?->?diabetes?} in  health domain belongs to this type of knowledge. The other is  unknown knowledge, which must be mined from Big Data.

For example, association link {?polio?->?Bill Gates?} belongs  to this type of knowledge. Here, ?insulin? and ?polio? have  active traction semantic feature.

Usually, a keyword with ATF can be used to describe the  attribute of an object or event. Or it is used to describe the part  of an object or event. For example, in Figure 1(a), the keyword  ?woman? is an object, which has been listed with four  attributes (described using keywords with active traction  feature) such as ?supplement,? ?menopause,? ?pregnancy,?  and ?fertility.? In Figure 1(b), ?Google? and ?apple? are two  described objects, which have been listed with some active  traction features such as ?search,? ?iPad,? and so on.

Definition 2: Passive Traction Feature of Keyword (PTF)   Fig. 1. Two basic association semantic features.

This article has been accepted for publication in a future issue of this journal, but has not been fully edited. Content may change prior to final publication. Citation information: DOI 10.1109/TII.2017.2647986,  AUTHOR ET AL.: TITLE 3    Passive Traction Feature of Keyword (PTF) is another kind  of semantic feature, which is owned by descendant keyword in  a keyword-level ASL. In our research, a keyword with passive  traction feature must satisfy the following two conditions:  ? A keyword mk with PTF must be extracted from a  domain Web resource on a given time window. This kind of keyword is also used as an element of representing domain knowledge.

? The keyword must be used as a descendant keyword  occurring in one or more ASLs.

Usually, these concept keywords with high frequency have  this type of semantic feature. For example, the association link  {?pregnancy?->?woman?} in human health domain (see  Figure 1(a)), ?woman? has passive traction feature. Similar  keyword example with PTF include ?emission,? ?climate? in  environment domain, ?Google? and ?apple? in Internet  domain.

In general, which semantic feature a keyword owns, ATF or  PTF, is determined by its own semantic. Anyway, it is the  basic unit of semantic representation of Web resources.

Semantic feature is the source of the semantic link from a Web  resource to other Web resources. A Web resource is linked to  other Web resources, which are related to its ATF and PTF  keywords. This problem will be discussed in the next section.

3.2 Four kinds of keywords  Based on the two basic semantic features, active traction  and passive traction, all the extracted keywords that need to be  used as a representation of domain knowledge from the Web  resource [2] are divided into the following four types.

Definition 3: Active Traction Keyword (ATK)  For a keyword mk , if it belongs to active traction keyword,  it must satisfy the following two conditions:  ? This keyword must be extracted from a domain Web resource and must be appointed/defined as one of the domain  keywords by the TF/IDF method. This ensures that it can be  used as an element of representing the semantic of Web  resources.

? This keyword only has the semantic feature of active  traction. That is, it must occur as the antecedent keyword of a  keyword-level ASL on a given time window. Certainly, this  ASL is a part of the keyword-level association semantic  network.

Definition 4: Passive Traction Keyword (PTK)  Similar to the definition of ATK, if a keyword mk  belongs  to passive traction keyword, it also must satisfy the following  two conditions. One is that it must be one of the domain  keywords extracted from a domain Web resource. The other is  that it only has the semantic feature of passive traction. That is,  it must occur as the descendent keyword of a keyword-level  ASL on a given time window.

Definition 5: Bridging Traction Keyword (BTK)  As a Bridging Traction Keyword (BTK), it has two types of  semantic features. That is, in an ASL, it occurs as the  antecedent keyword, which has the semantic feature of active  traction. In another association link, it appears as descendent  keyword, which has the semantic feature of passive traction.

Certainly, it is a necessary condition that it is one of the  domain keywords extracted from a domain Web resource.

Obviously, this type of keyword has a more important link role  in the semantic representation of Web resources.

Definition 6: Non-Traction Keyword (NTK)  The fourth type of keyword is the conversion to the BTK in  the semantic feature. It does not have the two semantic  features of active traction and passive traction. It is only used  as one of the domain keywords extracted from a domain Web  resource to represent the semantic of Web resources. Based on  the definitions of the four kinds of keywords, we can simply  plot their modes as in Figure 2.

This article has been accepted for publication in a future issue of this journal, but has not been fully edited. Content may change prior to final publication. Citation information: DOI 10.1109/TII.2017.2647986,     Usually, these concept keywords with high frequency have  this type of semantic feature. For example, in the association  link {?pregnancy?->?woman?} in human health domain (see  Fig. 1(a)), ?woman? has passive traction feature. Similar  keyword example with PTF include ?emission,? ?climate? in  the environment domain, and ?Google? and ?apple? in the  Internet domain.

4 THE DISTRIBUTION OF FOUR KINDS OF KEYWORDS This section aims to explore the distributions of four kinds of  keywords on two conditions: a given/fixed support and  different/variable supports of ASLs. At the same time, the  distributions of all keywords and ASLs are analyzed to do  comparisons with the distributions of four kinds of keywords.

4.1 The Distribution of Keywords at a given/fixed support and confidence  In this kind of distribution analysis, data sources are Web  resources of three domains (i.e., health, internet, and  environment) on Reuters Website. Then, these Web resources  are produced in a month according to a series of steps:  extracting domain keywords, semantic representation, and  mining ASLs. Note that the ASLs are mined at a given support  and confidence by the first mining and second re-mining [2].

The support and confidence are set as 2% and 50%,  respectively.

Based on the above steps, all the keywords are analyzed to  classify them into one of the four kinds of keywords defined in  Section 3.2. The statistical results of the four kinds of  keywords have been plotted in Fig. 3. From Fig. 3, in the  keywords of a domain, the proportion of NTK keywords is  very high. It is more than 95% according to the statistical  results of the three domains. At the same time, the proportion  of these keywords with association role (i.e., constructing  ASLs, antecedent keyword, and descendant keyword) is very  low. The statistical results are, respectively, 2.2%, 3.5%, and  3.8% for the three domains, health, internet, and environment.

According to these statistical data, the result about  ?association link/chain role? can be concluded as follows.

In the domain web resources text, the keywords with the  semantic association link/chain role are very small. Most other  keywords do not appear in the ASLs, and they do not have the  role of semantic association. Actually, they only play the role  of each text semantic description and representation.

In addition, the proportion of the keywords with the  semantic association link/chain role in the different domains  also reflects the clustering characteristics of the Web resources.

For example, the semantic link network of Web resources of  health domain has higher clustering coefficient [2].

Accordingly, its proportion of keywords with ?link/chain? is  smaller than the other two domains. Environment domain has  smaller clustering coefficient. Accordingly, its proportion of  keywords with ?link/chain? is higher than the other two  domains.

4.2 The distribution of four kinds of keywords at the changing support  Next, the analysis is carried out on different supports. So,  we first give the calculation procedure of the distribution by  adjusting the support as follows.

Algorithm 1: Analyzing the distribution of four kinds of keywords and their related ASLs  Input: the variable support, the semantic representation of  Web resources on a month  Output: the number of different keywords and related ASLs  1: set the support of ASLs as 2  2: get the ASLs from the given semantic representation of Web  resources by the method of ASL  3: count the number of four kinds of keywords occurring in  these Web resources, and their related ASLs  4: if the number of obtained ASLs is 0, then go to step 6  5: else add the support of ASL, and go to step 2  6: end  Note that, in this analyzing algorithm, the support is  simplified as an integer variable. Usually, the support is the  proportion of the document frequency and the total number of  Web resources. Because the total number of Web resources is  fixed in our adjusting process, the support can be simplified as     Fig. 4. The distribution of four kinds of keywords and their  related ASLs   Fig. 5.

According to this adjusting process, the distribution of four  kinds of keywords, the related ASLs, and their regression  results are plotted in Figure 4. In this regression analysis,  different regression methods are adopted. Based on the  probable trend, we employ power-law regression to analyze  the distributions of ATK, PTK, BTK, and ASLs. Multinomial  regression is selected to analyze the distribution of NTK. From  Fig. 4, we can find that the distributions of ATK, PTK, BTK,  and ASLs follow power-law function. And the distribution of  NTK follows four times the multinomial function. Further, the  Web resources of Internet and environment domain are  selected to analyze the distribution of the four kinds of  keywords and their related ASLs. The achieved parameters of  the regression analysis are listed in Table 1.

TABLE 1  The power-law exponent and its complex correlation  coefficient of regression analysis on four different supports  ATK PTK BTK ASL NTK  H b 2.25 2.87 2.39 3.76 /  R 0.98 0.99 0.96 0.99 0.99  I b 2.71 3.47 2.77 4.10 /  R 0.97 0.987 0.94 0.99 0.98  E b 2.19 3.11 2.95 4.21 /  R 0.98 0.97 0.96 0.99 0.99  In Table 1, ?b? denotes the exponent of power-law regression  and ?R? denotes the complex correlation coefficient of  regression analysis. From Table I, we can find the following  coincident result:  Result of regression analysis: four kinds of keywords and  their related ASLs except NTK strictly follow the power-law  distribution. Higher complex correlation coefficients show the  correctness of the regression analysis. More importantly, the  ?core semantic? gradually occurs with the bigger support of  ASLs.

5 HIERARCHY-CUTTING MODEL In this section, we first give the basic idea of the layered  theory. Then, the layered theory based on semantic  concentricity degree is presented. Third, the computing steps  of hierarchy-cutting model are presented.

5.1 The basic idea of hierarchy-cutting model  From the result of regression analysis in Section 3, all the  keywords with semantic traction feature, ATK, PTK, and BTK  follow the power-law distribution. At the same time, the  keywords and their related ASLs are becoming less with the  occurrence of larger support of ASLs. This means that some  ?basic semantic? is stripped and the ?core semantic?  gradually occurs.

If we regard the keywords-level association semantic  network at a given support as a filled circle, then we have  some concentric circles on different supports (from Figure 5(a)  to Figure 5(b)). Further, these concentric circles can be  simplified/reduced as Figure 5(c). Subsequently, the simplified  concentric circles can be mapped into a multilayer semantic as  shown in Figure 5(d).

Definition 7: Three-layer Association Semantic (TL-AS)  For the Web resources on a given time window, we can get  some keywords-level association semantic network (k-  ALN) 1 2,G G , mG (corresponding to some concentric circles)  on different supports 1{ ,fre 2 ,fre ,  }mfre . If we can  simplify them as Figure 5(c), then three-layer association  semantic can be defined as follows:  ? 1G can be named as the ?basic semantic? of the Web  resources on the given time window. This kind of semantic corresponds to the largest (i.e., outer) of concentric circles in Fig. 5(c).

? iG can be named as the ?main semantic? of the Web  resources on the given time window. This kind of semantic corresponds to the second large concentric circle in Fig. 5(c).

? jG can be named as the ?core semantic? of the Web  resources on the given time window. This kind of semantic corresponds to the smallest concentric circle in Fig. 5(c).

Actually, this basic idea is reasonable from the  mathematical theory. Because the keywords with ?link/chain?  reveal obvious power-law distribution, inflexion points are  easily found. In Figure 6, the power-law distribution curve is  divided into three areas according to two inflexion points, i.e.

up-cutting point and down-cutting point. Therefore, the main  tasks of hierarchy-cutting model are exploring the related  theory and completing steps.

5.2 The layered theory based on semantic concentricity degree  Based on the basic idea of the layered theory, we present the  detailed layered theory and its related concept.

Definition 8: Association Semantic Concentricity (ASC)  Association semantic concentricity is the repeatability score  of association semantic contained in two k-ALNs ,i jG G . For  the Web resources on a given time window, if two supports  { }i jfre fre? are given, two related k-ALNs ,i jG G  can be  achieved by Luo?s method [3]. ASC ( , )i jASC G G can be  defined as  ? ( , ) /i j Gj GiASC G G R R? , /Gi iR Count ?? ????????????  where GiR and GjR denote the semantic radius of iG  and jG .

iCount denotes the number of ASLs in iG .

This article has been accepted for publication in a future issue of this journal, but has not been fully edited. Content may change prior to final publication. Citation information: DOI 10.1109/TII.2017.2647986,     For the Web resources on a given time window, iG  and  jG are two k-ALNs generated on different supports  ifre jfre? , then we have 0 ( , ) 1i jASC G G? ? .

According to Definition 7, for two supports ifre  and jfre ,  if there is i jfre fre? , then, based on the generating method  of k-ALNs,  ? j iG G? ?????????????????????????????????????????????????  Correspondingly, we have  ? Gj GiR R? ????????????????????????????????????????????3??  That is,  ? ( , ) 1i jASC G G ? ????????????????????????????????????  In addition, for any ALN, we have  ? GjR 0? ?????????????????????????????????????????????????  So,  ? ( , ) 0i jASC G G ? ????????????????????????????????6??  Combining formulas (4) and (6), we have  ? 0 ( , ) 1i jASC G G? ? ??????????????????????????????  Corollary 2. The relations between the ASC and the  exponent of power-law distribution  Larger exponent of power-law distribution leads to smaller  average value of ASC. It is true on the contrary.

For the Web resources on a given time window, we can set  m support fre , and ALNs 1 2,G G , mG  can be obtained.

Larger exponent of power-law distribution means the changing  velocity of association semantic among these ALNs. This  inevitably leads to smaller average value of ASC.

Corollary 3. The changing trend of ASC  For m  ALNs 1 2,G G , mG , if the number of their ASLs  follow power-law distribution, then we have the sequence of  ASC, 1 2( , )ASC G G ? 2 3( , )ASC G G , 1( , )m mASC G G? ,  which is an increasing sequence.

Proof?Obviously, we only prove (1, )i m? ? ? 1( , )i iASC G G? < 1( , )i iASC G G ? .

According to the definition of ASC, we have  1( , )i iASC G G? = 1/Gi GiR R ?  = 1* / * / b b  i ia fre a fre? ? ? ?  ? = /2[( 1) / ]bi i?  (8)  Similarly,  ? 1( , )i iASC G G ? = /2[ / ( 1)]bi i ? ?????????????????????????  Therefore,  ? 1 1( , ) / ( , )i i i iASC G G ASC G G? ? = 2 2 /2[( 1) / ]bi i? <1? ?????  That is,  ? 1( , )i iASC G G? < 1( , )i iASC G G ? ? ?????  Thus, Corollary 3 is proved.

5.3 The computing steps of hierarchy-cutting  model  Corollary 3 proves that the standard sequence of association  semantic concentricity (ASC) is a strictly increasing sequence  in the case of power-law distribution. However, the actual  sequence of ASC is not a strictly increasing sequence. There is  a certain difference between the standard sequence and the  actual sequence. When the number of ASLs containing  keyword-ALN of adjacent layer changes sharply, the semantic  layer may have a large transition/jumping (such as the  semantic transition/jumping from the "main semantic" to the  "core semantic"). Thus, the following hypothesis of hierarchy-  cutting of association semantic is proposed.

Hypothesis about association semantic cutting point: If it  is called the theory of "standard ASC" on the condition of fully  satisfying the power-law distribution. Obviously, when the  difference between the actual ASC and the standard ASC is  larger, larger transition/jumping occurs between two adjacent  keyword-ALNs. Accordingly, the largest maximum and the  second maximum transition/jumping location (i.e., a given  support) can be viewed as two hierarchy-cutting points.

Based on the above hypothesis, the computing steps of  hierarchy-cutting model can be described as follows:  (1) Computing the number of ASLs  On the m  supports fre ?  { 1fre , 2fre , mfre }, the  keyword-ALNs { 1G , 2G , , mG } can be generated according  to the extracted ASLs. Based on the regression analysis, the  function between the number of ASLs count  and support  fre  should follow the equation  *count fre ?? ??  (12)  where ? and ? are two constants. According to equation (12),  the possible/theoretical value of the number of ASLs can be  achieved, { '  1count , '  2count , , '  mcount }.

(2) Computing the association semantic concentricity According to the real value of the number of ASLs, the  semantic radius of { 1G , 2G , , mG } can be computed.

Further, association semantic concentricity of any two adjacent  layers can be computed as 1 2( , )ASC G G , 2 3( , )ASC G G , ,  1( , )m mASC G G? . In addition, the possible/theoretical value of  association semantic concentricity of any two adjacent layers  are also computed by equation (12), '  1 2( , )ASC G G , '  2 3( , )ASC G G , , '  1( , )m mASC G G? .

(3) Completing the hierarchy-cutting This step aims to find the down-cutting point and up-cutting  point. It can be described as finding two obvious  changing/increasing values of ASC of any two adjacent layers,  i.e.

iASC? = '  1( , )i iASC G G? - 1( , )i iASC G G?  (13)  Suppose iASC? and jASC? are the maximum and  secondary values by equation (13), then the up-cutting point of  support frequency is i , and down-cutting point of support  frequency is j .

Citation information: DOI 10.1109/TII.2017.2647986,  AUTHOR ET AL.: TITLE 7    In this section, we present the experimental data and result  analysis to verify the multilayer theory of association semantic.

6.1 Experiment for layered theory  Three domain news data are selected from the Website  http://www.reuters.com, including health, environment, and  internet, to build keyword-level ALNs on different supports.

The time window of experimental data is set as a month.

For each domain news data, we independently execute the  extracting method of ASL on an adjustable support. The initial  value of the adjustable support is set as 2. Then, it is increased  gradually. The increasing step is 1. The ASC of any two  adjacent layers of keyword-level ALNs are computed by  Definition 7. The computed results are listed in Table 2.

Table 2  The ASC of three domains on different supports  sup H-ASC I-ASC E-ASC  2,3 0.343132 0.414126 0.412968  3,4 0.637229 0.628666 0.474075  4,5 0.686762 0.639767 0.61808  5,6 0.758913 0.682575 0.641689  6,7 0.703211 0.662589 0.845154  7,8 0.788811 0.781736 0.894427  8,9 0.779194 0.797724 0.707107  9,10 0.8044 0.755929 ?  aver 0.687706322 0.670389113 0.656214  In Table 2, the column ?sup? denotes two supports of two  adjacent layers. ?H-ASC,?  ?I-ASC,? and ?E-ASC,?  respectively, denote the association semantic concentricity of  health, Internet, and environment news domains. And the  average value of association semantic concentricity of each  domain is listed in the last row of Table 2. From Table 2, the  following conclusions can be drawn.

? Larger exponent of the power-law distribution leads  to smaller average value of ASC. It verifies the correctness of Corollary 2. We compare the results of power-law exponent listed in Table 1 and the average value of association semantic concentricity listed in Table 2. The keyword-level ALN of environment news domain has the largest power-law exponent and the smallest association semantic concentricity.

? It has larger ASC at larger support between two  adjacent layers. It verifies the correctness of Corollary 3. From Table 2, although a few decreases in association semantic  concentricity have occurred, this kind of increasing trend of two adjacent layers in total is obvious.

6.2 Evaluation method of hierarchy-cutting model  The evaluation of hierarchy-cutting model is mainly the  precision of cutting points including up-cutting point and  down-cutting point.

Let 1iG ? and iG denote two keyword-level ALNs of  adjacent layers. Figure 7 gives the possible constitution of two  keyword-ALNs of adjacent layers. In Figure 7, iG  is made up  of two subgraphs, 1S  and 2S . And 1iG ?  is made up of three  subgraphs, 1S  , 2S , and 3S . From Figure 7, 1iG ?  has been  added to two kinds of ASLs. One is making the semantic of  old subgraph more plentiful, which is plotted by dashed line in  subgraph 2S . The other is new occurring ASLs, which  constitute a new subgraph. Obviously, the proportion of this  kind of new subgraph is larger, the effect is better as the  cutting point of hierarchy model.

Therefore, the evaluation method of hierarchy model can  convert into the computation of the proportion of newly  occurring ASLs. For the series of keyword-level ALNs  { 1G , 2G , , mG }, the proportion series of added new  occurring ASLs can be achieved, which is denoted as  { 2pn , , mpn }. Then, the next task is finding the maximum  and secondary values in { 2pn , , mpn }.

Citation information: DOI 10.1109/TII.2017.2647986,     6.3 Experimental results for hierarchy-cutting model  Based on the proposed evaluation method, three groups of  experiments have been carried out and the results are plotted  in Figure 8. The first group is Figure 8(a) and (b), which  shows the experimental results of health domain on two sizes  of ALN. The other two groups are, respectively, internet and  environment domains. From Figure 8, the following  conclusions can be drawn.

? Two obvious peak values. From the three groups of  experiments, the proportion series of added new occurring ASLs between adjacent layers are all occurring between two obvious peak values. These two peak values ensure the precision of the hierarchy-cutting model.

? The stability of peak values. Two peak values have  stability on the given support. For three domains, the supports of down-cutting point are about 2.7%, 2.3%, and 2.0%, respectively. And the supports of up-cutting point are about 8.5%, 8.0%, and 7.8%, respectively.

7 DISCOVERY OF DOMAIN TOPIC ON THE WEB  In this section, two kinds of domain topics on the Web are  given. One is the current core topic of a domain; the other is  long-term topic.

7.1 Examples of current core topic of a domain  Current core topic of a domain can be defined as a kind of  topic focused by users during a short time (e.g., a day, a week,  a month). The data resources of this paper are processed  within a month on the environment of Big Data. So, it can  satisfy the time requirement of mining the current core topic of  a domain. In addition, the layer of ?core semantic? separated  by hierarchy-cutting model can provide support for the  discovery of current core topic. Actually, the discovery of  current core topic can be simplified as the searching of  semantic subgraph from the layer of ?core semantic.? Figure 9  has given examples of current core topic of the health domain.

Fig. 9 shows four core topics of health domain on 2015.11.

The first topic discusses about the ?aids? including infection,  antibiotic, etc. The second topic tells us about the problem of  ?smoking? and health. The third topic describes a new  technology about ?cancer treatment? problem such as breast  cancer, prostate cancer, and so on. The fourth topic discusses  the relation between ?heart attack? and ?cholesterol.?  7.2 Examples of long-term topic of a domain  Long-term topic of a domain can be defined as a kind of  topic focused by users during a long time (e.g., a year or more).

The layer of ?main semantic? can provide support for the  discovery of long-term topic. Similar to the discovery of  current core topic, finding long-term topic can be simplified as  the searching of semantic subgraph from the layer of ?main  semantic.? Figure 10 has given examples of long-term topic of  the health domain.

Fig. 10 presents the semantics of 11 long-term topics in the  health domain. They include: healthcare plan followed by  Obama, heart disease, human blood disease, AIDS, all kinds of  food safety licensing issues approved by the U.S. Food and  Drug Administration (FDA), women's health including  pregnancy, menopause, breast cancer and so on, tobacco and  smoking, the influence of education mode to kids disease;  medical insurance coverage, vaccine shot, and drug  prescriptions.

8 CONCLUSIONS The hierarchy-cutting model is presented to realize three-  layers division of association semantic for ALNs, which is  suitable for organizing Web resources on the era of Big Data.

It not only can provide theoretical support of the analysis of  domain topic (e.g., current core topic, long-term topic  belonging to a domain), but also can satisfy users? information  requirement on different particles/layers. The power-law  distribution of keywords with association linking role has been  discovered by regression analysis. According to the role of  ASL, two kinds of basic semantic features are defined. Further,  ASLs are extracted on different supports to compute the  distribution of four kinds of keywords. All the keywords with  association semantic role reveal obvious power-law  distribution characteristic by regression analysis. The  hierarchy-cutting model of association semantic has been built.

Based on the power-law distribution of association keywords,  the basic idea, theory, and steps of hierarchy-cutting model are  presented. The proposed model has completed the division of  three-layer association semantic, that is, ?basic semantic,?  ?main semantic,? and ?core semantic.? ?Core semantic? can  provide the support for discovering current core topic. And the  other two semantic layers can provide more details of the  related topic.

In future, we need further efforts to explore the organization   Fig. 9. Examples of current core topic of the health domain   Fig. 10.
