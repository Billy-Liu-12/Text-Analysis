Research and Design of Applying Association Rule in Course Management System

Abstract?Course Management System (CMS) is web-based system which is designed to simplify, streamline, and automate many aspects of the course?s management. But, traditional CMS has some problems in helping teachers gathering students? information. In this paper, we have designed a framework of association rules application called ARMOCMS, and implemented the prototype on Moodle platform, which is a popular open-source CMS. We adopted an improved version of PredictiveApriori algorithm to mine data. Specifically, we integrate the experience evaluation of experts and subjective evaluation of teachers into the system?s knowledge base. And then, the system will form weighted precision with rules being mined to strengthen the subjective interestingness evaluation.

Besides, the system can provide some suggestions to enhance the intelligibility of rules. The rules which are not matched will be classified according to their novelty in rank. The experiment result shows that our work can help teachers make better decisions.

I. INTRODUCTION With the rapid development of computer network  technology, Online Course Management System (CMS) is becoming more and more popular, and becomes an important platform of modern distance education. While CMS helps a lot in distance education, it still has some problems during the education. For instance, teachers can?t monitor the students? learning behavior directly in remote CMS teaching environment. This means that teachers need to gain more potential information about students? learning behavior to assist them in teaching guidance and decision-making.

However, the increasing CMS recorded data makes it difficult to analyze data manually. Data mining technology can automatic extract internal, efficient, novel and potentially utility knowledge from large data sets. Therefore, we can use data mining technology to help teachers evaluate teaching system[1]. Recommendation systems, which use data mining technology, can be classified into two types according to their target users: (1) student-oriented. We call this kind of system as Adaptive and Intelligent system(AIS), which provides better individualized learning experience for students based on their preferences and level of knowledge; (2) teacher-oriented. This kind of system can help teachers or system administrators  improve the system performance based on students? learning data.For the teacher-oriented application, HuangTao[2] used association rules tools to mine students? exercises and provide the relevance of knowledge to teachers, it can help teachers improve the exercises; Ramli[3] used association rules algorithm Apriori to mine the access log of online course page and analyze the relevance of visit path, then provide the information for teachers to adjust course structure. However, most teacher-oriented data mining systems paid little attention to the complexity of using the system. Besides, the algorithm configuration parameters are difficult to set, and the rules output are redundant and difficult to understand. In addition, the teacher-oriented systems paid little attention to rules interestingness, users need to filter the rules based on their own experience. This could increase the complexity for users.

Considering all of these, we have designed an association rules mining of CMS for teachers called ARMOCMS, and implemented its prototype in Moodle platform[4][5]. The prototype system uses an improved algorithm of PredictiveApriori (FPA) for mining association rules, this algorithm assess the interestingness of association rules through custom prediction accuracy. The system can get N most interesting rules by setting only one parameter and will not require users to have experience in data mining. The system integrates the experience evaluation of experts and the subjective evaluation of teachers into the rules knowledge base.

Then it forms weighted precision with rules being mined to strengthen the subjective interestingness evaluation, and then gives some suggestions to enhance intelligibility of rules. The rules which are not matched will be classified according to their novelty in rank, and this can help teachers make better decisions.



II. SYSTEM OVERVIEW  A. System Framework Figure 1 shows he basic framework of ARMOCMS. It has  been divided into three parts: (1) ?module for teachers", which is applied for the teachers to mine rules; (2) "module for experts", which is provided for experts to maintain rules knowledge base; (3) "Moodle platform", which is used to manage courses and record the learning behaviors.

1) Association rule mining. After the teachers make  courses in Moodle, students will produce a large number of learning data after learning courses. In "module for teachers" part, ARMOCMS uses FPA algorithm to mine data and find the N "best" association rules, then teachers can specify the scope of mining, such as which item should be included or ignored in the preceding paragraph and the latter, or restricted the length of them.

2) Subjective analysis. After the generation of association rules, we will implement the subjective evaluation of interestingness in order to provide suggestions to teachers.

There are two steps in our evaluation: firstly, we will make interestingness evaluation with weighted precision based on rules knowledge base, then sort the rules according to IAS[9] classification method.

3) Formation rules knowledge base. Rules knowledge base includes information about rules itself, description of problems and suggestions. Knowledge bases are initially provided by experts who have experience in this field. At the same time, teachers involved in the association rule mining process also implies a vote to rules. There may exist two situations in the association rules to be mined: one is "expected rules", it refers to the rules which exactly match the rules in the knowledge base, it means that knowledge of the rules has already been established in the knowledge base, teachers can adjust courses according to the recommendations of the rules, and when teachers adopting rules means that the rules are voted; the other situation is "unexpected rules" which refers to the rules that not exactly match any rules in the knowledge base, teachers can mark the rules which they want to add to the knowledge base, and then, these rules will be reviewed by the experts.

4) Suggestions. Results will be presented to teachers after  the process above. And the results will show the problems existing in the course so that the teachers can consider the recommendations and decide whether to adopt them.

B. Key Technology ARMOCMS uses FPA algorithm to mine students'  learning data and form the objective evaluation of rules, then implements the subjective interestingness evaluation, firstly, we should make interestingness evaluation with weighted precision based on rules knowledge base, and then sort the rules according to IAS classification method. Subjective evaluation is based on the experience of users and will be used to judge whether rules are interesting, the metrics suggested by Silberschatz[6] is: 1) Novelty: the rules, which are unknown or contrary to the  knowledge of users, are interesting.

2) Enforceability: the rules which allow users to take  measures or improve themselves, are interesting.

C. FPA algorithm The characteristics of PredictiveApriori algorithm[7] is  simple parameters configuration, we can get the N most interesting results by simply inputting one parameter N, but when the data which needs to be mined is large, it will take too much time. Therefore, we can adopt the transaction compression thought of AprioriTid algorithm[8] to improve the efficiency of the algorithm. PredictiveApriori algorithm needs to scan all of the transactions in the database twice when producing the frequent itemsets, this will greatly increase the I/O operation and reduce the efficiency of data mining if the database is large. According to the properties that the superset of any non frequent itemsets must be non frequent itemsets, we know that the transactions which don?t contain any k-itemsets could will not contain any (k+1)-itemsets. Therefore, we can ignore these transactions when solving the frequent itemsets whose length are bigger than k, thus we can gradually reduce the transactions of scanning and then reach the purpose of improving the efficiency of original algorithm.

We conducted the experiment using two sets of artificial data, one set of data contains 5 items, the other one has 10 items, each set contain 20 datasets whose size range from 500 to 10000, for each dataset we mined 100 rules, the result of this experiment is shown in figure 2.

Figure 2. The efficiency of PA and FPA algorithm     As shown in figure 2, the efficiency of PA and FPA algorithm have little difference when the data is small. In fact, FPA/5 processes data slower than PA/5 about 500 or 1000 data, this phenomenon is caused by the different sample prior distribution (c) that adopted to calculate predictive precision.

But when the data is large, there is significant difference in the execution time of PA and FPA. The performance of FPA is more excellent than PA.

D. Weighted precision evaluation of expected rules 1) Weighted precision evaluation of expected rules. The  value of weighted precision determined by two factors: (1) predictive precision Acc which calculated by FPA; (2) experts and teachers according to their prior knowledge to judge the weights W of the rules. The calculation of W is determined by the experts' and teachers' vote for rules.

Let R = {R1, R2,..., Rn} represent all the expected rules, then the weight of the rule Ri voting by teachers is calculate as follow formula:  m  j j  i t  RNumVT  RNumVT W  )(  )( (1)  In formula (1) NumVT (Ri) is the number of teachers that have voted for rule Ri.

By applying the same reason to the experts? votes:  k  j j  i e  RNumVE  RNumVE W  )(  )( (2)  In Formula (2) NumVE (Ri) is the number of experts that have voted for rule Ri.

According to the above formula the weight of rules W=Wt*Cu + We*Ce and Cu+Ce = 1, Cu and Ce represent the weight coefficient of teachers and experts respectively, they are all equals 0.5 in ARMOCMS. Then the Formula of weighted precision is:  m  accRij WWA  m  j RiRi  1* (3)  According to Formula (3) WRi is the weight of the rule, and accRij are the predictive accuracy returned by the PA algorithm for each teacher that has voted for the rule Ri.

2) The result of unexpected rules are classified as  unexpected consequent rules, unexpected condition rules and both-side unexpected rules according to IAS[9]. Thus the subjective analysis of expected rules and unexpected rules according to the result set is completed, and it provides a clearly-sorted result to teachers according to interestingness.



III. SYSTEM OPERATION  A. Moodle data Moodle course is a tree structure, the course is divided into  several units, each unit is divided into several lessons, units and lessons contain many learning activity such as web links, forums, quizes and so on. Each lesson contains several exercises and concepts which are relevant to the subject, the description of concept is shown in various forms such as documents, image and flash etc.

The attributes mined by ARMOCMS are mainly related to the course learning time, activity participation and course scores etc. The specific mining attributes are listed in table 1.

Table 1. ARMOCMS association rules mining attributes list  Level Attibute Description  Course  ctime Completion time of course  cscore Average score of course cattempts Attempt time of course  cquiz_attempts Attempt time of quiz cquiz_score Score of quiz  cchat_messages Chat messages cassignment_score Score of assignment  cforum_read Read number in forum cforum_post Post number in forum cdoc_view Document views of  course  Unit  ulessons Lessons contained in unit utime Completion time of unit uscore Score of unit  uattempts Attempt time of unit uforum_read Read number in forum uforum_post Post number in forum  udocview Document views of unit Lesson lconcepts Concepts contained in  lesson ltime Time of lesson  Exercise etime Completion time of exercise  escore Score of exercise  B. Operational steps Generally speaking, the application of ARMOCMS is  divided into modules for teachers and modules for experts.

According to the mining process of association rules, modules for teachers will be divided into four steps:  1) Pretreatment. Before association rules mining we should preprocess the data table so that each data can be mined according to FPA algorithm, the main work is the discretization of continuous value items. The operation is shown in figure 3, the classification of property data is divided into LOW, MEDIUM and HIGH through the discretization width, scores partition and manual setting operation.

Figure 3. Pretreatment interface  2) Parameter configuration. The operation is used to configure mining parameters so that mining area can be restricted. As shown in figure 4, it can set the max number of rules, the max number of items included in preceding paragraph, and the rules that should be ignored. In addition, we still need to choose the mining depth such as course- lesson, lesson-exercise, unit-lesson etc.

Figure 4. Parameters configuration interface  3) choosing rules knowledge base. The specific rule knowledge of a course does not suit to others, so the rules in knowledge base is classified according to the specific course, include the type of course (computer science, linguistics etc.), grade of course (university, middle school etc.) and difficulty of course (basic, intermediate, advanced etc.). The rules knowledge base has been chosen, so we can ignore this step. And only the administrator needs to do this, as shown in figure 5.

Figure 5. Choose rules knowledge base interface  4.) Processing results. The result will be listed after mining and it will be divided into unexpected rules and expected rules.

For the unexpected rules, teachers can mark them after analysis, and then submit them to knowledge base so that the experts can make sure. For the expected rules, some rules pointed out the specific issues of the course which can be directly modified or deleted in system, while others pointed out the general problems and provided corresponding operation suggestions. For example, the description about exercise time and obtain scores is: If ctime=HIGH(10) Then cscore=LOW(10). This rule describes that students spend a long time on the exercise but obtain a very low score. Finally, for this kind of rules the interpretation is as follows: (1)the exercise is wrong or ambiguous, teachers should correct the problem; (2)the exercise is too difficult for students, teachers should adjust the difficulty. In addition, other rules like "If uscore=LOW Then cscore=MIDDLE", it describes that students obtain a very low score after learning the unit but still obtain a relatively high score of course, it means that there is some kind of problem in that unit and teachers need to analyzed this unit.

Figure 6. Processing results interface  The primary function of "module for experts" is provided to maintain the rules knowledge base, experts can add new rules and vote for them, as shown in figure 7. Rules knowledge base is formed by the joint action of experts and teachers. Experts vote for the evaluation and certainty of a rule,     as shown in figure 8, the full mark of each item is 100, and each level is classified into very low(20), low(40), general(60), high(80) and very high(100), finally we can obtain the weight We in formula (2) by taking the average of the six items; besides, teachers vote for a rule when they adopt it, the vote of a rule is either 0 or 100 so that we can get the weight Wt of teachers.

IV. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we have designed a framework of association  rules application in CMS called ARMOCMS for teachers, and implemented the prototype on Moodle. Our goal is to help teachers improve the network learning course through the recommendations of association rules mining. This paper introduces the overall framework of system, then describes the key technology of system, such as FPA association rules mining algorithm and weighted precision evaluation etc. After that we make a detailed description of our system.

In fact, there still exist some drawbacks in the system, for example, the expansion of rules knowledge base needs the continuous participation of experts and teachers, and the experimental environment is relatively strict, and needs many  students to study the course for a long time to obtain enough mining data. Our future work is continually improving the system by analyzing the mining data and verifying the effectiveness of the system.
