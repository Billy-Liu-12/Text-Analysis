I.  INTRODUCTION Online studying can provide courses. Each user is often  only interested in one course or several courses. Thus lots of information on the website is useless to single user. How to find users? interests, and bring the convenience and enlightenment for users in a web environment, is discussed in this paper.

The users leave many web access log files which reflect their study customs and interests. In order to obtain single user?s study custom and interest, this paper presents a personalized recommendation system based on web log mining .It?s to find not only single user?s frequent sequential paths that he had visited in the past, but also associated courses and pages that he might hadn?t visited before. Thus different users could enjoy different recommendations in the improved online studying environment.



II. WEB MINING TECHNOLOGY The web data includes web server access log, proxy  server log, browser log, user registration information, and users ? session [1].In this paper we mainly use web log as data source, so we use the concept of web log mining instead of web mining .

The process of web log mining is as follows: (1) Data preprocessing or data preparation is the first  stage of web log mining. The raw data is converted into the data with which pattern discovery could deal. It includes data cleaning, user recognition, session recognition, path supplement, transaction recognition and so on. Web log data preprocessing has a direct impact on the correctness of models and pattern rules which are discovered in the next stage. (2) In the second stage, using various methods, we attempt to find models and pattern rules of users? access  behavior. Common technology is as follows: sequential patterns, association rules, clustering, and classification and so on. This paper chooses two applications of sequential patters and association rules. (3). In most cases, web usage mining can find all the modals and rules. Pattern analysis is used to extract valuable interesting patterns from all these models and rules.



III. RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM FRAMEWORK A personalized service model is presented in the paper.

With the mining technology and analysis of web logs or other records, the system could find users? interests and habits. While an old user is visiting the website, the system will automatically match with the active session and recommend the most relevant hyperlinks what the user interests. The model is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1.  Personalized service model  A. Analyzing requirements The requirements of online studying personalized  recommender system are as follows: (1). Pattern mining engine that system provides finds single users frequent paths, and adds hyperlinks to his pages. In other words, system can automatically identify each user?s frequently sequential pages and store them .When the user visit the site next time, hyperlinks of those pages will be added so that he could directly link to his individual pages being remembered. (2) In addition to single user?s own frequent access paths  Web log data  Extract ?interested? patterns  Real-time information recommendation  Studyers  2009 International Symposium on Intelligent Ubiquitous Computing and Education  DOI 10.1109/IUCE.2009.79   2009 International Symposium on Intelligent Ubiquitous Computing and Education  DOI 10.1109/IUCE.2009.79     recommendation, the system also recommends relevant pages that are visited by other users. That is to say, those who have partly visited the same pages may have similar interests. The recommended pages serve for every user as suggestions; moreover, it is important enlightenments and suggestions.

B. Designing framework In order to achieve these individual requirements, web  log mining and personalized recommendation model are integrated and designed as follows: (1) Data preprocessing module: corresponding to the data preprocessing process of log data. (2) Data mining module: in the module, the difficulty is how to deal different issues with different algorithm. Frequent sequential paths mining algorithm and Apriori algorithm for association rules mining will be implemented in this paper, to achieve requirements of personalized service. (3) Real-time intelligent recommendation module: it is the only online processing module; moreover, it?s adapter between users and system.

The following figure shows the architecture of personalized recommendation system.

IV. WEB MINING ALGORITHM Users? frequent path can mostly reflect the users?  interests is a sequence of pages browsed during a certain period of time. Providing personalized service according to one?s interests, users? frequently access path mining is of great importance obviously. In the frequent paths mining algorithm, input is a set of transaction recognition: MFP set [2]. Output is a set of user?s frequent paths and the corresponding support rate. Based on these conclusions the system could find users? interest modes. Relevant definitions and concepts are as follows.

Definition 1 Let P={?1, ?2,?, ?n}be a page sequence, and P is called a frequent page sequence or frequent access patterns if P meets the condition:  m { | } | 100%  | | T P T S  W TS ? ? ?                     (1)  Where T is a web transaction; S min (0< S min <1) is a  minimal support rate threshold specified by user; WTS is a web transaction set.

Definition 2 A page sequence of length ?n? is also called an n-sequence.

Construct k FP in order to mine users? k-length frequent access path. The main idea of this algorithm is based on the concept of candidate paths set. Find a candidate path whose length is k from MFP set, and then calculate its support rate in all the single user?s sessions.

The M largest support of paths set is FP k m . .

Construct FP k  Algorithm: Input: a user?s MFP set: F i Output: a user?s frequent access path set: FP k (k> l) For every F i {  For each { ? 1, ? 2 ??, ? n } in F i { If (k > m){ For (j =1; j< m ---k + l; j + +) {  if{ ? j??? ? j+k-1  } in FP k support of{ ? j??? ? j+k-1} +1  else if support of{ ? j??? ? j+k-2}7S k-1   and { ? j??? ? j+k-1}7S k-1   inser{ ? j??? ? j+k-1}in to FP k ;  } }}}  Before call the above algorithm, calculate support of  every page whose length is 1 in the session. Then from 2 to k call this algorithm cyclically, and each cycle uses the results of the last cycle supports.

For the exploration of the association rules, many researchers usually use the classic Apriori algorithm. Some research articles have shown that the association rules of a relational database can provide a useful method for mining knowledge on different application areas [3-4]. At the beginning, the classic Apriori algorithm is designed to find hidden associations from a massive of market records. To put relevant goods adjacently is beneficial to sales.

Similarly, to put relevant pages or courses together on education websites could beneficial to users. In a web education environment, association analysis is to find the relationship among different courses and information provided by the website. This paper uses the Apriori algorithm as a methodology of association rules for data mining.

The process of Apriori algorithm is based upon transaction database[4], so the original web log should be converted to transaction database. The web page-viewed model presented in this paper is as follows:  T= { t1 , t2 , ? , t m }                                                 (2) t i = < tid,, uid, p i >, p i = < p i1 , p i2 , ? , p ik >     (3)  Where T is a web page-viewed transaction database; t i consists of three parts: tid stands for a transaction?uid stands for a user, and i p stands for different pages the user browsed. So this model records all pages which are visited  Studying online system  Web Server  Web log  Real-time recommendation  Mode set  Web mining algorithms  Session (transaction)  Data preprocessing     by the users.



V. CONCLUSIONS The personalized recommendation system presented in  the paper could find users? customs and interests. Due to the convenience and enlightenment for online users, the personal services are achieved to a great extent.

Web mining technology is a good choice for intelligence and personalization system. However, both in theory and in practice, there are still some problems in web mining. In future we will research on such directions: to accurately identify the users in an agent environment, to effectively judge session boundaries and to improve the efficiency of algorithms for web mining.
