Title Named Entity Recognition using Wikipedia and  Abbreviation Generation

Abstract? In this paper, we propose a title named entity recognition model using Wikipedia and abbreviation generation.

The proposed title named entity recognition model automatically extracts title named entities from Wikipedia so constant renewal is possible without additional costs. Also, in order to establish a dictionary of title named entity abbreviations, generation rules are used to generate abbreviation candidates and abbreviations are selected through web search methods. In this paper, we propose a statistical model that recognizes title named entities using CRFs (Conditional Random Fields). The proposed model uses lexical information, a named entity dictionary, and an abbreviation dictionary, and provides title named entity recognition performance of 82.1% according to experimental results.

Keywords? Title named entity, Wikipedia, Conditional random field, Abbreviation generation.



I.  INTRODUCTION A named entity refers to a word that is not registered in  regular dictionaries or is a proper noun such as a person?s name, a name of a location, or an institution name. Named entity recognition refers to the recognition of such named entities within the natural language and categorizes them according to their meaning. Studies on named entity recognition mainly began with the recognition process of people, location, and institution names. Recently, various named entity categorization systems are being developed and studied for various application fields.

With the recent and active development of voice conversation interfaces on IPTVs and smartphones, new named entity categorization systems and recognition technologies are required. In particular, constant renewal of a named entity dictionary is necessary for cases where new named entities are continuously generated such as song, drama, and movie titles.

Furthermore, since title named entities are commonly used as abbreviations, maintenance of a dictionary is inevitably costly.

Wikipedia (www.wikipedia.org) is an open encyclopedia where numerous editors continuously write and edit while everyone can freely access such information, and as such can be useful as a massive knowledge source.

In this paper, a title named entity recognition model utilizing Wikipedia is proposed. Constant renewal is possible for the proposed model since the named entity dictionary is  generated using Wikipedia. Moreover, an abbreviation dictionary is generated in order to recognize title named entities described as abbreviations. The statistics-based model CRF (Conditional Random Fields) was used as the named entity recognition process, and vocabulary, part of speech, the named entity dictionary, and an abbreviation dictionary were used as features.



II. RELATED WORK Named entity recognition research mainly utilizes statistics-  based classification models. The most widely used statistics- based models include MEMM (Maximum Entropy Markov Model), CRF (Conditional Random Fields), and SVM (Support Vector Machine) [1][2]. Unfortunately, there were not many studies on title named entity recognition recently. In [3], titled named entity recognition for English was proposed. This paper presented a method involving the repetition of pattern expansion using dictionary information and expansion of the dictionary using the expanded pattern information. As a study on analyzing abbreviations, [4] analyzed abbreviations based on the finding that most English abbreviations are composed of capital letters and that the initial letter of each word is used for arranging during abbreviation generation. [5] defined an abbreviation generation rule for Korean to establish an abbreviation dictionary.

III. TITLE NAMED ENTITY DICTIONARY In this Chapter, we describe a method that generates title  named entity and abbreviation dictionary using Wikipedia and web search. A diagram of the overall composition of the proposed model is shown in Fig. 1.

A. Title Named Entity Dictionary Construction using Wikipedia New words are constantly created with the passing of time  and this creates the burden of continuously renewing and updating the named entity dictionary. To solve this problem, data from Wikipedia are used in this study to generate a named entity dictionary. Pages of Wikipedia include classification information tags, and thus the classification of the named entity of the corresponding page can be identified through the classification information. Fig. 2 shows the classification information tag for the Wikipedia page of the TV program ?I am a Singer (?? ???)? as an example. It can be seen through the classification information that ?I am a Singer? is under the classification of ?Program(????)?.

Figure 2.  Example of a Wikipedia page Na-neun Gasooda(?? ???)  In this study, the 10 classifications of ?Title(??)?,  ?Song(??)?, ?Program(????)?, ?Movie(??)?,  ?Drama(???)?, ?Cartoon(??)?, ?Novel(??)?,  ?Animation(?????)?, ?Book(?)?, and ?Essay(??)? from the Wikipedia classification information were selected as the classifications to determine a title named entity. The titles of pages categorized within the selected classifications were used to construct the title named entity dictionary. As a result, a total of 7751 named entities were extracted. Here, extraction is performed by comparison with the last syntactic word of the classification information tag.

B. Abbreviation Generation of Title Named Entity In actuality, there are numerous cases where a title named  entity is used as an abbreviation in a natural language. For example, ?Na-gasoo(???)? is used as an abbreviation for  ?Na-neun Gasooda(?? ???)? while ?Moo-do(??)? is used for ?Moo-han-do-jun(????)?. When a title named entity appears as an abbreviation like these examples, they cannot be applied to the title named entity dictionary. In this  study, the abbreviation rule studies in [5] were used to generate an abbreviation candidate for each title named entity. Two abbreviation rules were used and they are shown in Table 1.

When the title is longer than 5 syntactic words, only the first 5 syntactic words were extracted.

TABLE I.  ABBREVIATION GENERATION RULE  Rule1. Multiple syntactic word combination type  disc.

For title named entities composed of more than 2 syntactic words, abbreviation candidates are  generated using the 2 or more initial morpheme, syllable, or a combination of each syntactic  word comprising the title named entity.

For title named entities composed of a single syntactic word, among the morphemes that  compose the title named entity, a combination of the initial syllables of 2 or more morphemes is  used to generate abbreviation candidates.

Moo-han-do-jun(????) ?[??/NNG+??/NNG]  = Moo-do(??)   Among the generated abbreviation candidates, there are a number of candidates that are not used in real life. It is thus necessary to verify whether the candidates are abbreviations that are actually used. In this study, verification is performed through an Internet search under the assumption that the title named entity and the corresponding abbreviation can be found in the same page. At this point, the second stage verification is attempted.

First, the target title named entity is collected by searching the Internet using a search engine, and among the search results for each questions, 100 snippets are extracted. The abbreviation candidate that is most frequently encountered in the extracted snippets is selected as the solution abbreviation.

Second, the abbreviation selected through the first stage verification is conversely verified through an Internet search.

The abbreviation is searched using a search engine and if the title named entity exists in the snippets, the abbreviation is chosen as the final abbreviation. Fig. 3 shows the verification example of ?Na-neun Gasooda(?? ???)? and its  abbreviation ?Na-Gasoo(???)?.

IV. MACHINE LEARNING MODEL  A. Conditional Random Fields In this study, a probabilistic model for title named entity  recognition using Conditional Random Fields(CRFs)[6] was produced. We have used the toolkit CRF++ 0.54[7]. All morphemes contain the morpheme unit boundary tags ?B?, ?I?, ?E?, or ?O?. ?B? is the first morpheme of a title named entity, ?I? is the middle morpheme of a title named entity, and ?E? is the last morpheme of a title named entity. If there is only one morpheme, the ?B? tag is given. Also, morphemes not included in the title named entity are given the ?O? tag. Fig. 4 shows the tagging results for ?I want to watch Na-neun Gasooda(??  ?? ??? ?? ??)?.

Figure 4.  Example of a BIEO tagging  B. Feature set The set of basic features for the probabilistic model  includes the morpheme, part of speech, and spacing. Here, the spacing feature is Boolean value of first morpheme in syntactic word. In addition we use dependency relation of position i as feature.  Table II shows the basic features that are used.

In this study, features were generated through the named entity dictionary generated from Wikipedia and the abbreviation dictionary generated using abbreviation rules. The named entity dictionary feature uses the Boolean value of the  longest named entity among the named entities in a sentence that match a named entity in the title named entity dictionary.

Table III shows the dictionary features that are used.

V. EXPERIMENTS In this paper, the corpus of 3808 sentences in Korean,  where the BIEO information of each title named entity was tagged, was used. We have used the UTagger[8] library for morphological analysis and POS tagging. We also used a dependency parser[9]. In a corpus, a total of 2056 title named entities exist. 80 percent of the corpus was used for learning and 20 percent was used for evaluation. For the evaluation of performance, the Recall, Precision, and F1 score were used as the criteria for each named entity unit. The results are shown in Table 3.

TABLE IV.  RESULT OF EVALUATION  feature set Table Column Head  Recall Precision F1 score Lee[3] (in English) 0.584 0.522 0.552  basic feature 0.438 0.489 0.462 +Named Entity Dic 0.730 0.952 0.826  +Abbreviati on Dic 0.733 0.958 0.831    The F1 score was 81.4% when the abbreviation dictionary was not used as a feature set while the F1 score was 82.1% when the abbreviation dictionary was used as a feature set.

Among the test data, for the cases where the title named entity was described as an abbreviation, an F1 score of 0% was obtained when not using the abbreviation dictionary.

Meanwhile, an F1 score of 75% was attained when using the abbreviation dictionary. It is unfair to compare directly Lee[3] and our model, because Lee model used corpus in English. But it is sufficiently to explain that our model make good use to title named entity tagging.



VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, a method of establishing a title named entity  dictionary using Wikipedia and an abbreviation dictionary using abbreviation generation rules was proposed. In addition, a web search based verification method for verification of the extracted abbreviations was proposed. Also, a CRFs probabilistic model using the morpheme, title named entity dictionary, and abbreviation dictionary as features for title named entity recognition of a natural language was proposed, and a performance evaluation resulted in an F1 score of 82.1%.

For the named entity recognition, the dictionary has to be constantly renewed due to the generation of new named entities; however, the cost increases. On the other hand, the proposed model utilizes Wikipedia, which is continuously updated, and thus a dictionary can be automatically established with no additional cost.

As a freely accessible massive knowledge source, Wikipedia has potential to be applied to a diverse range of fields. For future studies, various methods to apply and utilize Wikipedia should be researched.
