An Intelligent Peak Search Program for Digital  Electron Diffraction Images of 3D Nano-crystals

Abstract?Electron diffractograms are lattice images of crystalline samples taken in transmission electron microscopy for molecular structure determination studies. Electron diffraction is a technique widely used in material science and recently it is gaining significance also in life science for studying 2D and 3D organic crystals. However, often the images suffer from strong background noise, masking the data points. Moreover, they suffer also from the strong center beam exposure or a big beam- stop which covers a lot of useful information.

This paper presents a user-friendly peak search program in which an autocorrelation algorithm is utilized creatively to intensify the signal and to center the image in the particular regular lattice. An adaptive background removal algorithm is designed to remove the central beam and to reduce the background noise. The latter algorithm can be used for a wide range of applications, such as 2D spectral analysis in physics, NMR Analysis, stars recognition of aerospace photographs.

I.  INTRODUCTION In electron crystallography diffraction images have been  successfully used for structure determination of crystalline materials (e.g. metals and alloys) in inorganic material research [1, 2]. Electron diffraction images are also used for solving molecular structures of 2D crystals of transmembrane proteins [3, 4], crystals far too small for X-ray crystallographic studies.

Electron diffraction can be used for studying 3D organic nano-crystals which are relatively easy to grow for a large group of materials compared to the micro-size crystals, which are a prerequisite for X-ray crystallographic studies. As a potential new method of bio-molecular structure determination, electron diffraction is gaining more popularity and importance.

In protein 3D electron crystallography, recent progress includes standard procedures for determining the 3D unit-cell parameters [5]. Image processing of such electron diffraction images is indispensable. Peak search is generally the first important step in processing the digital electron diffraction images of the 3D nano-crystals.

Several peak search programs are available in X-ray crystallography and physics, e.g. [6-7]. Other peak search programs are specially designed for electron-crystallography, e.g. [8-11]. These programs were tested with our diffraction  images of 3D protein nano-crystals. However, the programs either failed or performed quite poorly probably due to the high variance background of the central electron beam and the irregular shadow of beam-stop.

We designed and implemented an automatic peak search program with a graphic user interface, called AMP (Autocorrelation Mapping Program), for pre-processing the diffraction images of 3D nano-crystals and peak position location. In our program, the new idea of using autocorrelation maps is implemented to intensify the signal and to accurately center the image (see [5] for more details). This new idea makes use of the particularly regular lattice in electron diffraction patterns. A more general method of adaptive background removal is designed and implemented subsequently for accurate peak search. The automatic peak search program was shown to have a stable performance by processing a large amount of experimental diffraction images.



II. PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION  A. The graphic user interface (GUI) The new program AMP (Autocorrelation Mapping  Program) was designed to be user-friendly. Its goal, therefore, is to be able to read and visualize all the images that are being processed in the peak search program. A graphic user interface (GUI) is implemented to provide the users a simple ?select and click? way for running the image processing jobs. The program is written in Matlab. It has been compiled into a standalone executable program.

Figure 1 shows a screenshot of the AMP main interface.

The diffraction image that is going to be processed is visible on the left and more options and controls are provided to the user on the right panel. Except for the necessary input parameters, the user can select which intermediate output needs to be visually checked in the processing. Notices and information on the run is shown on the bottom right. Currently, AMP supports TIFF (both 16-bit and 32-bit deeps) and JPEG image formats the most widely-used formats in storing digital images.

Supports for other image formats can be arranged easily.

Figure 1.  Main GUI of the intelligent peak search program ? AMP. The  image displayed on the left is a digital electron diffraction image of an aspirin nano-crystal with a strong central beam and the shadow of the beam-stop. On the right is given the panel with options for input and output of parameters.

The main task of this program is to remove the irregular background and to search for reflection spots on the diffraction images. While running the task, the program creates an autocorrelation map (an inverse Fourier transform of the electron diffraction pattern) which fills up gaps or absences in the data, enhances the signal-to-noise ratio and centers the diffraction pattern. The autocorrelation map and peak coordinates generated by the program are used as input files for later structural analysis of the nano-crystals (e.g. unit-cell determination [5]) and for solving the molecular structure.

B. Batch processing and testing results The program was designed to process all the images in one  directory as a batch. One can choose to work with JPEG, TIFF images or both at the same time. The program takes less than 2 minutes to process a single 32-bit gray image with a size of 1024 by 1024 pixels on a single-core Pentium 4 PC with 1GB memory.

Since there is always a limited amount of virtual memory available in a computer and the diffraction images that will be processed are normally very big, the maximum amount of images windows that can be opened simultaneously is limited.

To avoid running out of memory, if there are a lot of images in one directory, it?s suggested to disable all the options of ?figure output?.

AMP expects electron diffraction images of about 1024 by 1024 pixels (though they don't need to be exactly this size). By default, diffracted intensity should be positive (?white? on most display programs). If the spots are negative (black on a white background), the ?Inverse Intensity? option needs to be selected. It is good practice to store all the data of one EM experimental session in one directory for latter data analysis.

For testing the program, six experimental image data were used, including data from both organic and inorganic nano-  crystals: lysozyme, penicillin, mayenite, aspirin, ferric phosphate and oxacillin. More than 400 diffraction images in total were tested. The results showed a high performance of the program with a ~96% success rate. One of the results of the peak search program is given on figure 2. The images show that the peak searching program was able to correctly identify (pick) the diffraction reflections in spite of the high background noise present in the original diffraction image.



III. METHODS  A. Autocorrelation mapping for intensifying the signal and filling up the missing spots In electron crystallography, it is important to find the lattice  coordinates in the peak search step, because most of the peaks are located in a regular lattice due to the planar lattice feature of the electron diffraction pattern. However, for organic data the diffraction spots may be missing due to the crystalline symmetry, beam damage, crystal imperfections, the strong central beam exposure or strong noise (also see figure 2a).

Once we know the lattice, we know where to find the peaks.

An inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) is applied to the original image to yield an autocorrelation map which is the correlation of a signal with itself. This is very useful for finding a repeating pattern as well as to reduce the random noise. Since the spots are regularly distributed in the electron diffraction image, the spacing between spots is also regular. An autocorrelation map of this image will also show a regular lattice, in which the signal is strengthened (figure 2c).

If an image has a high degree of repetitive elements, an autocorrelation map will show bright/strong spots which have an intensity that is considerably higher than the background.

One can easily find the peaks on such an image. By superimposing the original electron diffraction image and its autocorrelation image, we can search for peaks only near the peaks region of the autocorrelation image. As a result, an accurate peak search can be performed which is less affected by the noise level.

B. Adaptive Background removal The level of the background noise is very different for the  different images. Therefore the background removal algorithm cannot use a simple fixed-threshold method. Statistic features (e.g. rotation average value & variance curves) must be used to remove the background noise. Although the signal of the autocorrelation images is stronger, the noise from the original image is still present, affecting the peak search accuracy. The background noise needs to be removed from both the original diffraction image and its autocorrelation image. The only difference is that the radial central beam doesn't need to be removed from the autocorrelation images. A three-step procedure is employed to erase the background:  ? Radial central beam removal  In order to generate an autocorrelation image of good quality, the strong background noise and the strong intensity of the central beam as well as the shadow of the beam-stop must be removed as efficiently as possible.

The blue circles indicate the selected peak positions. (c).

Inset of an autocorrelation image of the background removed image. The autocorrelation image has the same orientation and spacing as the original electron diffraction image - (a), but unlike the original image the autocorrelation map is naturally centered. Strong and regular signal spots (no missing reflection near the  center area) are present on the pre-processed image - (c)  Calculating the centroid of the whole image helps us to find the preliminary center of an electron diffraction pattern. Then, by calculating the rotation average intensity curve of the image, the radial feature of the central beam can be easily found. By subtracting the image with a fitted disk background most of the circular intensity caused by the direct beam exposure can be removed.

If a beam-stop is used, a shadow of the beam-stop appears in the diffraction image (e.g. the image in figure 1). The irregular shape of the beam-stop makes the calculated preliminary center differ a bit from the real center. Within a user-defined tolerance, the program can still continue processing and accurately center the image in a later step (that will be introduced below). User-interference is also an alternative choice (provided as ?user beam remove tool? in figure 1) to help the program to more accurately locate the center, which is useful if the beam-stop is rather large and affects the preliminary centering procedure too much.

? Gaussian-filtered background subtraction in real space  After radial central beam removal, a peak search function can be carried out directly. However, problems arise when one is dealing with spots that have roughly the same intensity as the background or when large artifacts are introduced by irregular illumination or strong noise. These problems are also introduced in the autocorrelation map which is additionally affected by the ?big empty hole? caused by center beam/beam- stop removal (see figure 3a). In this case one needs an algorithm that provides an intensity background landscape of the total image to be subtracted rather then setting a fixed threshold value for the whole image to locate the peak regions.

In image processing, conventionally a high-pass Gaussian filter is used for the removal of the low frequency global background. It works in Fourier space and affects the global features of the images. In our case, most of the noise and turbulence intensities are locally gathered around the center of the image, therefore we expect that the noise is subtracted locally while the rest of the intensity is less affected. Therefore the high-pass Gaussian filter is not an optimal way to remove the irregular background here. Irregular background is subtracted in real space in our program.

(a) 3D view of an image after the three-step background removal procedure (b) Quadratic fitting curve (green) of the rotational average intensity (red, without the sharp center) of the final processed image. The fitting curve is employed as adaptive threshold to define the potential peaks region in which the exact  center of the peaks may be located.

Gaussian filters (low-pass Gaussian filter) are normally used to smooth data, because of its averaging small signal variations. If one uses a very large/wide Gaussian filter it actually blurs an image to a high extent. Each intensity peak is broadened until it becomes almost flat. The result is an image that serves as a background of the original image.

An intensity background landscape is calculated (as shown in figure 3b) by filtering the image with a wide Gaussian filter (e.g. a width of 1/32 of the image size). This landscape is then subtracted from the image as an irregular background in real space. Subtracting this background from the original image yields sharper peaks with lower intensities, while the background is set to a value near to zero. The contrast between peaks and background become larger. Figure 3c shows an example of this subtraction (a smooth filter is also applied), as a result, the complete signal spots clearly show up compared to the background.

? Low-pass Gaussian filter to erase spike noise.

A narrow low-pass Gaussian filter is applied to smooth the image (erase random noise). By default, several pixels width of Gaussian filter is enough to remove the spikes or singularities in the image. This Gaussian filter is done in Fourier space, which is different from the Gaussian background subtraction in real space in the previous step.

The resulting image is smooth (figure 3c and 4a) and the final autocorrelation map shows sharp peaks in which artifacts play no role of importance. The important difference between figures 3c and 3a is that the ratio between high and low intensities has increased massively which is used in the final peak search step.

A fitting (green line in figure 4b) is applied to the rotational average intensity (without the sharp center) of the processed image afterwards, which serves as a dynamic threshold to restrict the region for searching the peaks in the image.

C. Definitively centering the original images with the autocorrelation images At the beginning, we calculated the centroid of the whole  image as the preliminary center of an electron diffraction pattern. This center is accurate enough for imaging processing work, but not sufficient for precise scientific data analysis.

The center of an autocorrelation map is known by the definition. The autocorrelation map is thus also used for definitive centering of the original diffraction image: Using the autocorrelation map as a template and shifting the original or background-removed image, until the image fits best with the autocorrelation map. The program thus finally centers the original image.

D. Locating the Peak center The peak search algorithm reduces each spot ? consisting of  numerous pixels above the adaptive threshold - to a single (x,y)-coordinate. To complete this task, pixels are checked against their neighbors. Only those pixels with a lower value in each direction will be treated as a final peak (see figure 5), and are stored in an output file. Figure 2b show an example of the resulting peaks, which are clearly marked by blue circles in the diffraction image.

IV. DISCUSSION A new idea in the program is the application of  autocorrelation maps to intensify the signal and finally to center the original image. Intensifying the signal is important for improving the signal-to-noise ratio as well as for identifying diffraction spots which are masked or buried under noise. The algorithm presented shows improved performance especially when the noise is high and weak signal spots tend to be absorbed in related areas.

This method particularly makes use of the planar lattice feature of the electron diffraction. Slight curvature of electron diffraction images is not a problem in this particular application, since the autocorrelation map is only used as a reference and we still go back to search peaks in the original images. This method has been shown to give very good results when dealing with regular patterns, but not in general for other peak search applications that do not have a repetitive signal.

The adaptive background removal algorithm can be used in a wide range of applications, although it is originally developed to extract peaks from diffraction patterns. This algorithm has the main advantage of Gaussian filtered background subtraction in real space. In real space, the noise is subtracted locally while the rest intensity is less affected.

To give an example, the algorithm is applied in background removal of Star clouds. This algorithm can remove backgrounds in an image that shows the hot blue stars at the core of globular cluster M15, yielding only the single stars (figure 6). While a similar function, Imtophat (a built in function of Matlab to remove background), has problems to distinguish real spots from the background, which results in missing stars and a lot of background noise.

V. CONCLUSION A program with a user-friendly interface for peak searching  in digital electron diffraction images of 3D nano-crystals is presented. The program yields stable results during the test of various types of experimental images. The results of the program provide a solid base for further data analysis and  structure determination of 3D nano-protein crystals from electron diffraction images.

The regular spacing of diffraction signal was strengthened in a new method in which autocorrelation mapping is applied.

The implemented background removal algorithm is general for peak search applications. An example of star recognition was successful and shown in the discussion.

The program is available as a free pre-processing program for analyzing electron diffraction data of nano-crystals. The output of the program is used further for unit-cell determination of crystalline materials. The program of AMP is available at http://www.bfsc.leidenuniv.nl/software/.
