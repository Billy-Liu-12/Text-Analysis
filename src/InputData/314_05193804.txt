An Algorithm of Quantitative Association Rule on Fuzzy Clustering with  Application to Cross-selling in Telecom Industry

Abstract   One application of data mining technology is to find the relationship of some product and sell appropriate product to appropriate customer at appropriate time.

In order to applying data mining technology to help telecom companies  find more cross-selling chances and carry out more available marketing measures to existing customers, an algorithm of quantitative association rule on fuzzy clustering is used in this paper. By combining fuzzy C-means and subtractive cluster method, a fast discrete algorithm can determine some initial clustering centroids avoiding initializing again.  We also do some empirical analysis for telecom industry to identifying cross-selling opportunity.

Empirical results show that fast discrete algorithm combining FCM and SCM can make association rule index trends differentiation which improves the probability of cross-selling success. The algorithm of quantitative association rule on fuzzy clustering can solve the problem of fasten iterative rate and identify classification of discrete self-adoption, so as to help business department doing exact decision making.

Key words: cross-selling; data mining; fuzzy  clustering; quantitative association rule  1. Introduction   With IPTV and 3G coming, the amount of value-  added operation will increase, telecom companies are always thinking about a new question: how to introduce appropriate product to appropriate customer with appropriate price? The traditional way to solve the problem is inspiration. Only relying on inspiration can lose many business opportunities, for many good sales opportunities can not be seen directly. Final sales depend on many factors: age, profession, consumer behavior, life style, experience, etc. Comprehensively  analyzing these influence factors of marketing based on data mining technologies can accomplish the task well.

The large-scale telecom operators in China pay more efforts to apply information technology and establish some systems such as operation data store, data ware and customer relationship management. The amounts of data of telecom enterprises are mass, including basic customer information, behavior information and valuable information, such as time length, frequencies.

For the purpose of gaining competitive advantage, business intelligence system in telecom industry also changes from simple record data to complex analysis of customer behavior and provides marketing decisions-making. Business intelligence system take up with sharing data collected by subsystems and use mass information to analysis customer behavior and improve marketing efficiency. Marketing decision need to use multi-dimensions data to inquire, rotation, drill and slice for synthesis analysis and create report forms to give some conclusion for decision-making reference. Dataware and data mining are important forms of business intelligence and play an important role in customer relationship management.

Cross-selling is a CRM-based marketing strategy to sell more products and services  in accordance with customers? needs. Felix (2001) studied cross-selling applied in banking  and  indicated that sequencing the cross-selling products being offered to the customer can assist the bank?s sales to  define a ranking of the different products and select the products which corresponds best to the customer?s profile[1].

Cross-selling in Chinese telecom industry in research and practice are still beginning, there exist many questions unresolved. There still lacked for academic researches about applying cross-selling to telecom industry, including customer trait, operation characteristic, identifying cross-selling opportunity, etc. As data mining tools being more and more applied  2009 International Joint Conference on Computational Sciences and Optimization  DOI 10.1109/CSO.2009.441   2009 International Joint Conference on Computational Sciences and Optimization  DOI 10.1109/CSO.2009.441   2009 International Joint Conference on Computational Sciences and Optimization  DOI 10.1109/CSO.2009.441   2009 International Joint Conference on Computational Sciences and Optimization  DOI 10.1109/CSO.2009.441       to telecom industry, some technologies like data mining and knowledge find will play important role in improving customer relationship level.

In Chinese telecom industry, data mining can help improve marketing efficiency on relative integrated and mass data. This paper represents a data mining approach for telecom enterprise to identify cross- selling opportunities. The goal is to find appropriate product combination, and then telecom companies can introduce the rest products to customers who have buy part of the product combinations and find customers who have the most probability to buy these product combinations.

2. Algorithm of quantitative association rule   In literatures of data mining, there are a lot of researches on association rules. However, it may be true that the results of association rule are not directly useful for Chinese telecom business sector. Therefore, more and more improved technologies had been put up to match business requirements and give solutions of some particular issues, such as cross-selling. Mass data collected from service management system and charging information system have been used to transfer to marketing chance and knowledge discovery using data mining technologies to improve marketing validity and efficiency in telecom sector. Guo and Shu (2004) discuss data mining's idiographic applications and its commercial value in telecom field and study the structure model of information system of telecom enterprises, which includes the application of data mining [2]. Ding (2000) tries to find internal association among age, education, industry, profession, and place before buying with the application of data mining [3]. In data process progress, the author first transfers the classification attribute of education and profession, quantitative attribute of age and income and so on, and then applies association rule to data mining.

In the studies of association rule application, quantitative variables will be prior defined concept classified by experience or telecom experts to discrete.

This kind of discrete is prior determined, not considering the actual condition, which can be defined to static discrete method. Static discrete method can not follow the change of consumer behavior, which should cause poorly business meaning  due to immoderate data discrete. We adopt a method of fuzzy cluster to solve this question and combine subtractive cluster method to improve transaction capability and self-adapt, which overcome the shortage of incorrect hierarchical.

Srikant & Agrawal (1996) put forward a formal quantitative association rule mining frame [4]. The research methods of quantitative association rule can be divided in to two ways. One way is taking classification attribute considering solely or separating quantitative variables as mining item and then apply Boolean association rule to data mining. Finally, we can classify  data mining rules according to quantitative variables partition standard. The deficiency of this method is that if the amount of classification attribute and quantitative variables is very big, the result will output overfull rules or rules under the minimum support level. The other way is partitioning quantitative variables into several zones according to specific standard which transfer quantitative variables to Boolean variables, and then apply Boolean association rule to data mining. In this way of data mining, discrete mapped of attribute variables become a key factor of quantitative association rule. Degree of partition attribute zones of discrete mapped is a critical factor of quality of data mining.

In the methods of partition, K-means is a prevalent method but is found to be non-robust. Garcia-Escudero & Gordaliza (1999), Looney (2002) also referred some weakness of K-means algorithm such as centroid will be different under different initial condition which leads to different results of partition [5] [6].

Bezdek?1973?brought fuzzy C-means algorithm to improve the weakness of K-means method,   which based on an iterative optimization of a fuzzy objective function, and designed the partition coefficient to measure the amount of overlap between clusters [7].

The objective function is  ( ) ( ) ( )?? = =  = c  i  N  k  m  m ikikVUJ du 1 1  ,min  Nku c  i ik ??=?  =  1,1  ;  ikik VXd ?= ,  ( )?? ,1m  s.t.    ? =  ??= c  i ik Nku  1,1  Nkciuik ?????? 1,1,10  ? =  ??<< N  k ik ciNu  1,0  iV  is classification cluster center. ikd  refers to the distance between data point kX  and iV . Superscript m       is weight index which indicate fuzzy extent. The amount of m big means fuzzy extent is big, the amount of m small means fuzzy extent is small.

The fuzzy clustering algorithm is used for unsupervised classification. In many applications, this algorithm depends on assumptions made about the number of subgroups present in the data. Therefore, we discuss ideas behind cluster validity measures and propose a method for choosing the optimal number of clusters. We adopt subtractive cluster method to decide cluster center to avoid the weakness of classification in fuzzy c-means algorithm.

Subtractive cluster method is a fast and independent cluster method, which take all data point as cluster center candidate. { } Mn RxxxX ?= ,,, 21 ?we define density of xi is  Di,  Di = ?? ?  ?  ?  ?? ?  ?  ? ? ?  ? ??  ? ???  = 2   exp rxx ji  n  j  ? , the maximum  of Di is 1cx , we choose 1cx as the first cluster center.

Assumed kc  x is number k cluster center?which density index is  kc D ?we modify the density function  as follows:  clii DDD ?= exp ?? ?  ?  ?  ?? ?  ?  ? ? ?  ? ??  ? ?? 2  2 rxx cli ?  We choose the maximum density index 1+kc  x as new cluster center. The amount of calculation has linear relation with amount of data point, but has none business with dimension. In SCM algorithm, the amount of cluster is controlled by proportion parameter, and can restrict upper limit of the amount of cluster under k. The order of subtractive cluster center is decided by density index, which appear more early may more likely be initial cluster center in fuzzy C- means. Therefore we can take the first appearance i cluster center as new initial cluster center so as to improve the efficiency of cluster method.

3. Applications to cross-selling   We apply our improved cluster method to telecom sector and test its validity. We choose customer data of July 2007 from a North China province. The scope of chosen customer is normal subscribers which consume more than one kind of new business. We choose five operations as objectives to apply quantitative association rule, MMS (Multimedia Message Service), Mobile Newspaper, SMS (Short Message Service), call forwarding, weather forecast. We select MMS as  quantitative attribute to discrete. We also give results of Boolean association rule in order to compare the effect of cluster.

Firstly, we eliminate zero volume and empty data, transform data adopted Z score, and then doing sigmoid transform, the result input to discreteness. The output of cluster center adopting subtractive cluster method and fuzzy c-means is as follows: 0.4701 433063.4556 0.9776 2382.609 cluster 1 [0.46?0.47] cluster 2 [0.49?0.50?0.51???1]  Based on the result of cluster, we get the two partition of MMS defined more MMS and few MMS, which including subscriber 963208 and 1655985 respectively, the corresponding proportion is 36.77% and 63.23%.

After data preparation, we use data mining tool software TWM4.1 to analysis business, setting minimum support 0.01, minimum confidence 0.01, minimum lift 1.0 and minimum Z score 3.We adopt two methods: Boolean association rule and quantitative association rule, the results are presented in table 1 and table 2.

Table 1 Boolean association rule result  Prod uct 1  Product 2 Sup- port  Confi- dence  lift Z score  MMS Mobile Newspaper  0.086 0.386 4.13 454.49  MMS SMS 0.204 0.917 1.09 41.55 MMS Call  forwarding 0.018 0.082 1.24 28.64  MMS Weather forecast  0.035 0.159 1.05 10.18   Table 2 Quantitative association rule result  Prod uct 1  Product 2 Sup- port  Confi- dence  lift Z score  More MMS  Mobile Newspaper  0.066 0.928 9.94 726.89  Few MMS  Mobile Newspaper  0.028 0.179 1.92 111.11  More MMS  SMS 0.065 0.926 1.10 24.48  Few MMS  SMS 0.141 0.905 1.07 28.42  Few MMS  Call forwarding  0.012 0.077 1.17 17.60  More MMS  Weather forecast  0.015 0.211 1.39 40.70   4. Discussion         Comparing two tables, we can see there exist obvious difference. Some of corresponding index changed because of discretion MMS to more and few classification.

1. More clear association rule index We can find that in the association rule of MMS  and Mobile Newspaper quantitative association rule index trend to extreme. Four quantitative association rule index of more MMS and Mobile Newspaper are all higher than that in Boolean association rule. Four quantitative association rule index of few MMS and Mobile Newspaper are all lower than that in Boolean association rule. Practical explanation is subscribers who have used MMS more have high recognition and business stickiness about MMS, thus will be more likely to subscribe Mobile Newspaper.

2. Weak association rule index eliminated In the Boolean association rule of MMS and call  forwarding, lift index is 1.24, confidence index is 0.082, but in quantitative association rule more MMS and call forwarding is eliminated for support index less than 0.01.

The change of association rule index and change of support index can eliminate weak association rule index. The change of lift and confidence can make clear of association rule so as to learn more about business characteristic and describe clear profile of targeting customer, which improve  cross-selling efficiency. We apply cross-selling operation with subscribers who had MMS and Mobile Newspaper.

The amount of targeting customers is: 2619193?? 1-0.386?=1608185, the probability of cross-selling success is four times of that to common customer. If we apply cross-selling operation with subscribers who had MMS and Mobile Newspaper, the amount of targeting customers is: 963208? ? 1-0.928 ? =69350 ? the probability of cross-selling success is ten times of that to common customer. We also can see from the result that the amount of targeting customers of more MMS and Mobile Newspaper is twenty three parts of that of MMS and Mobile Newspaper, the probability is 1.5 times more.

5. Conclusion   In research of dynamic discrete of quantitative  association rule, we combine fuzzy c-means and subtractive cluster method to improve cross-selling efficiency. This fast discrete method can fasten iterative rate and identify classification of discrete self- adoption so as to help business department doing exact decision making.
