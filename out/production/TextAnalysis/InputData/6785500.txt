PATTERN DISCOVERY IN BIG DATA STREAMS  Name: Silviu Paun Supervisors: Udo Kruschwitz and Massimo Poesio ? University of Essex  Mike Fisher and Paul Mckee - BT    OVERVIEW ? Generic area of interest: Big Data  ? Challenges: the 3Vs ? Heterogeneous sources: Microblogs, IoT sensors  ? Context: Smart Cities ? Transport sector  ? Stride project ? Focus: the analysis of useful correlations between event-  related data in Microblogs and data coming from various sensors.

? These correlations are candidate patterns and the system  in question should be able to perform different pattern- related operations such as detection, verification, prediction and description.

A PRACTICAL EXAMPLE THE MICROBLOGS SIDE    A PRACTICAL EXAMPLE THE SENSORS SIDE    A PRACTICAL EXAMPLE OVERVIEW OF THE FRAMEWORK    CONCLUSION This work targets to identify patterns using data correlations observed from Microblog platforms and IoT sensors in a large scale system, a scale which simulates the dimensions (3Vs: volume, velocity, variety) of Big Data.
