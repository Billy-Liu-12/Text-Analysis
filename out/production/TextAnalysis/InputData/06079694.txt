Abstract?Data mining is a key technology to get useful knowledge, This paper discusses the data mining association rules' important role in online shopping, through discussing ,building and analysis ing the model based on actual data, obtain that data mining association rules are playing an more and more important role in every aspects of our life and make a forecast to the future development.

Keywords-data mining, online shopping,  association rules analysis

I. OVERVIEW With the development of e-commerce and  logistics, online shopping plays an increasingly important role in people's life. People can get the commodity they want without going out and the time to shopping out is saved. With a number of B2B, C2C, B2C companies and third-party payment platform, people make the virtual trading on line true. Some well-known e-commerce site get lots of benefit from mining association rules. These online shopping site use mining association rules to get useful information from the huge database, and then set the commodity in bundle that the customer intends to purchase together. And there are also some shopping sites use them to set the appropriate cross-selling, where when the customer who bought one product will see another related commodities? advertising.

The online shop can provide customers with more convenience through the data analysis of sale goods. And what?s more, the online shop can analysis consumer?s preferences and shopping patterns by data mining to make the personalized product recommendations.

As computer?s applications wide spread, the accumulation of data becoming larger and larger.

We can extract useful information to us by data mining techniques. The web site can process their business information deeply based on original information system so as to strengthen their competitive advantage and increase their turnover.

The data mining of online shopping can help to predict sales, marketing, select the right time to participation in product sales promotion such an  seckill, group purchase, which will useful to make profit for the shop.



II. THE APPLICATION OF DATA MINING IN THE ONLINE SHOPPING  A. Basic Concepts An affair happened may result in another affair.

Or the two affairs may occur at the same time largely. Then we can predict another affair by the happened affair with the association rules in order to better understand and master the development of things, trends and more. This is the basic meaning of association rules in data meaning. The famous Wal-Mart's "diapers and beer" is discovered by data mining.

Suppose I is a set[1] of items. Given a transaction database, where each transaction is a nonempty set of I, namely that each transaction is corresponds to a unique identifier TID (Transaction ID).Association rules in D support is the percentage of the probability of the transaction contains both X and Y; Confidence is the percentage of the transaction containing X also  Y namely conditional probability. Association rule is interesting, if the minimum support threshold and minimum confidence threshold which thresholds are set based on man-made excavation needs.

B. Practical application of mining association rules technology  It is widely applied in online shopping, its main application at present are  as follows: 1) Recommended to buy[2-3].

When we shopping online, there is usually a "frequently purchased together," "Customers who bought this product also buy" or "view customers who buy this product ultimately ".These dugged data can be decision-making reference to the customers. By analysis the relevance of the data in the database, the various goods available potential link could be attained. With the tradition techniques such as statistical techniques and traditional techniques, we can take the strategy of binding sale and recommended sales and also the similarity goods recommended for purchase, eliminating the customers to face a vast amounts of information and difficulty to find the necessary goods .

2011 Fourth International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Design  DOI 10.1109/ISCID.2011.153         2) Inventory management and sales forecasting[4].

In the holidays, the shop can take the strategy such as seckill, price discounts, free Shipping if full amount or full capacity in the premise of the inventory allow. For example, winter and summer seasonal sales, seckill, group purchase forecast.

According to information stored in the database to identify the sales curve and predict the future, to have a better control of inventory.

3) Market positioning.

Use the data mining tools and statistical models of the database to analyze the data carefully and study the customer's consumption habits, advertising success rate and other important information. We can take a research in the goods of different types, in order to facilitate market positioning, and through the excavation of the information and analysis, forecasting demand of commodities, stock trends and determine commodity prices.

4) Customer analysis.

Through the analysis of customer purchase history, you can analyze customers? preferences, take certain strategies, such as full capacity automatically become a member to discount stores, to explore new customers, retain old customers.



III. CASE STUDIES IN PRODUCT SALES We tend to focus on the customer's relationship  with the goods, that is, different clients (different ages, different regions) preference for different goods, which can use to supply personalized services. But we often overlook another aspect, the relation between commodities. For example, a typical association rules as follows: " 90% of customers who bought bread and butter also buy milk", which indicate the potential exists association among bread, butter and milk.

We analysis the record sales (2000 records) of a corporate[5] which sell cosmetics and toiletries, Suppose there are four kinds of products, for example: 1, 2, 3, 4:  (1)Among the 2000 transaction records, the number of records(NR) that contain two commodities is as Tabl  shown.

TABLE I.  THE NUMBER OF RECORD THAT CONTAIN TWO COMMODITIES                     (2) In the 2000 transactions, the number of commodities ,shown in Table :  TABLE II.   THE NUMBER OF COMMODITIES     (3)  According to Table ?, calculate the support  as follows:  TABLE III.  THE SUPPORT OF X TO Y   X  Y 1 2 3 4 5  1  0.4125 0.3900 0.2800 0.3010 2 0.4215  0.4060 0.2260 0.2910 3 0.3900 0.4060  0.2065 0.2600 4 0.2800 0.2260 0.2065  0.4790 5 0.3010 0.2910 0.2600 0.4790  (4) Calculate the confidence in the condition  that the minimum support threshold is (0.3), the confidence as follows:  TABLE IV.  THE CONFIDENCE OF X TO Y   X  Y 1 2 3 4 5  1  0.6990 0.6468  0.5 2 0.6915   0.7160 3 0.6341 0.6602 4     0.7549 5 0.4500   0.7149  Listed all the rules whose minimum confidence  threshold (0.67) namely the rules derived from association analysis:  Rulel: 1 2 surport=0.4215   confidence=0.6990 Rule2: 2 1 surport=0.4215   confidence=0.6915 Rule3 2 3 surport=0.4060   confidence=0.7160 Rule4: 4 5 surport=0.4790   confidence=0.7549 Rule5: 5 4 surport=0.4790  confidence=0.7149 From the above rules we can draw the  following conclusions: ? customers who bought 1cream ,most of  whome will buy 2; ? customers who bought 4, most of whome  will buy 5 at the same time, and vice versa;   X  Y 1 2 3 4 5  1  843 780 560 603 2 843  812 452 582 3 780 812  413 520 4 560 452 413  958 5 603 582 520 958  NAME   1 2 3 4 5 NR 1260 1134 1230 1269 1340         ?customers who bought 2, most of whome will buy 3, but otherwise is not very common.

According to the conclusion from the above, companies can adjust their marketing strategies: the associated products should be placed in a similar place, products should be associated together in the promotion.

For example when the customer purchased the 1, We can recommend a variety of2, including a list of their links to web sites.



IV. THE DEVELOPMENT OF DATA MINING Nowadays there are many data mining system,  but its application in practice is not very strong.

The key lies in how to combine data mining technology with existing technologies and expertise knowledge in every fields. Expand and improve continuously. Data mining has the trend to the visualization, unstructured and multimedia so that to make the data mining process can be understood by more and more users.

With the advent of information age, the degree of corporate information continues to deepen. The enterprise collect a large materials and data of products, customers, sales and other information, how to dig out valuable knowledge from these data, to help decision support will be a theme of knowledge-based economy. Using data mining techniques to make a deeper process of data, obtain the general characteristics of data and forecast the trends. The techniques will play a key role to improve the competitiveness of enterprises and provide reliable and reasonable basis for better usage for business people, financial, and material.

In the near future, the data mining technology is no longer the monopoly of people who have professional background but a popularity tool.

Many foreign industries such as telecommunications, credit card companies, banks and stock exchanges, insurance companies, advertising agencies, shops, etc. have used the data mining tools to help to carry their business activities. At present ,our country in this application is still in its infancy and has great potential in the market. The people who preferred to use this technology will get more benefits. Thus it can be expected that data mining technology in various industries, especially commercial fields will be widely used.

Because many applications are often more complex, lots of reaearch extend the association rules  from different point of view to combine more factors into association rule mining method in order to rich the application of association rules, broaden the scope to support management decision-making.

Such as taking the hierarchical relationships of attributes, tense relations, multi-table mining into consideration. Association rules research in recent years are focusing on two aspects, namely extend the solving scope of classic association rules and improve the efficiency of classical association rule mining algorithms and rules of interest .

One important issue the data mining will face is privacy and information security, Some social issues such as privacy, illegal data trading , data valuation and other issues will inevitably in the process .These deep-seated problems will become increasingly prominent with data mining technology continues to evolve.This may not only requires self-discipline of business, law?s perfect but also need the joint effort of client. What?s more, further study of related method is needed so as to ensure privacy and security in appropriate information access and mining process.
