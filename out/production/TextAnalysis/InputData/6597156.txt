Surveying Systems of Global Climate Change Simulation Data and Access Logs to them

Abstract?This paper introduces the browser for multi- dimensional dataset such as global climate change simulation datasets and the visualization system for access logs to the datasets which we are now constructing. Many of large scientific datasets have multi-dimensional structures and it is necessary to consider multi-dimension to browse such datasets in order to utilize the data efficiently and to understand the behavior of the requests for them.

I. INTRODUCTION The global warming becomes very important issue in the  world. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) described in their fourth assessment report that warming of the climate system was unequivocal, there was very high confidence that the global average net effect of human activities since 1750 had been one of warming and more extensive adaptation than was currently occurring was required to reduce vulnerability to climate change[1]. IPCC is now making the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). The simulation datasets used for the AR5 are Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) data by World Climate Research Programme (WCRP)[2]. CMIP5 data consist of the simulation results from more than 50 models by more than 25 institutes in the world and they are archived and published in the distributed system called Earth System Grid (ESG)[3]. The ESG currently archives more than 1.5PB of CMIP5 data. Our system (Data Integration and Analysis System: DIAS) is one of the ESG nodes and the CMIP5 data from Japan are published through DIAS.  The number of archived and published CMIP5 data in DIAS is more than 800,000 and the size of those is almost 420TB. DIAS is the largest node in ESG.

Large scientific dataset such as CMIP5 data have multi- dimensional structures. For example, the files and the dataset in the CMIP5 data are identified by several attributes such as institute name responsible for the datasets, model name generating the datasets, experiment (simulation scenario), and so on. That is, the CMIP5 data has multi-dimensional structure where the attributes are recognized as axis. The user interface in the ESG portal site serves searching dataset  in the CMIP5 data. It shows, however, only the list of the datasets possessing the attribute values user specified. In addition, in this interface the user can select only an item in each attributes. The CMIP5 data providers do not always publish the all datasets with every attribute items. They only provide only some datasets with some attribute items.

Therefore, it is not easy for the users to grasp the availability of the required datasets. The scientists concerned with global climate change often compare the some datasets in the CMIP5 data and in such cases they need the group of datasets with all the same attribute items except one or two attributes. To search such groups of datasets and to grasp the available of them we are now constructing the browser for multi-dimensional dataset such as CMIP5 data for the DIAS users. In this browser the user can select any combination of attribute items to search and the search results are shown in a table where any two attributes can be assigned to the row and the column.

In the data node administrators? view, to understand the behavior of access requests is important. In the large archiving system, the pattern of accesses affects the performance significantly. To analyze the pattern and optimize the file placement make it possible to improve the response time of the system and moreover it may reduce the power consumption of the storage. The ESG does not provide any tool for analyzing the access logs. Therefore we are constructing a visualization system for the ESG access log. This visualization system provides with the 3 dimensional view of access pattern to understand the behavior of the request sequences.

In this paper we describe the CMIP5 data and our data node briefly and then introduce the browser for surveying of multi-dimensional dataset availability. We explain the application of this browser to the CMIP5 data. After that we describe the system for 3 dimensional visualization of the access logs of our data node.



II. CMIP5 AND ESG  A. Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) The CMIP5 data is generated for the AR5 by IPCC. It is  expected that some of the scientific questions that arose  2013 IEEE International Congress on Big Data  DOI 10.1109/BigData.Congress.2013.52     during preparation of the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) will through CMIP5 be addressed in time for evaluation in the Fifth Assessment Report. Therefore the CMIP5 data is larger and more precise than CMIP3 used in AR4. Not only the experiments (simulation conditions and scenarios) but also the data format and the name space in metadata are regulated precisely[4][5][6]. Each file and each dataset are identified by the attribute values described in Data Reference Syntax (DRS). The dataset is uniquely identified by the attribute values of Activity, Product, Institute, Model, Experiment, Frequency, Modeling realm, MIP table and Ensemble member (Table I). Additionally the published dataset is labeled by the version number to specify the revised dataset. The dataset consists of several data files separated by the variables. The data file is identified by the attribute value in Variable name in addition to the attribute values of the datasets. Furthermore, the data files may be divided into several files according to the time periods of the simulation. In this case, Temporal Subsets attribute is labeled to the data file. These attributes is not always independent of each other.  Each experiment requires its own variable sets and time periods.  The level of dataset requirement is also defined in each experiment. The data providers do not have to publish all of the datasets. They provide with some of datasets depending on their model characteristic and their ability. Therefore the number of files differs according to the model, the experiment, the frequency and so on.

TABLE I. ATTRIBUTES OF CMIP5  Attribute Description Activity The model intercomparison  activity or other data collection activity. For CMIP5 all data have ?CMIP5? activity.

Product Product name. Depending on the requirement level, ?output1?, ?output2?, etc. are assigned.

Institute The institute responsible for the model results.

Model The used model. This name might include a version number.

Experiment The experiment name which specifies the simulation scenario and so on.

Frequency The interval between individual time-samples in the atomic dataset. For example, ?yr?, ?mon?, ?day?, etc.

Modeling realm High level modeling components relevance for the dataset. For example, ?atmos?, ?ocean?, ?land?, etc.

Variable name The name of the physical quantity.

MIP table The name of table which describes  the requested variables and the level of requirement for the experiment and the frequency.

Ensemble member Triad of integers which  distinguishes among closely related simulations by a single model. There integers roughly represent realization, initialization and perturbation conditions respectively.

Version number The version number of a publication-level dataset. The version number is updated when any file included in the data is modified, replaced, or removed, or when an additional file is added to the dataset.

B. Earth System Grid (ESG) 1) Archtecture  The all of CMIP5 data are published only through the ESG[7][8]. ESG is a distributed system developed by Earth System Grid Center for Enabling Technologies (ESG-CET).

Several kinds of open source software such as MyProxy, THREDDS Data Server and so on are used as a component of ESG.

ESG consists of several kinds of nodes. Data node provides with services for publishing and serving data, IdP node provides with services for authenticating users, index node  provides with the applications necessary to index and search metadata and compute node provides with services for data analysis and visualization. The typical data downloading steps are as follows. At first the user accesses to the index node which also works as ESG web portal site and searches the dataset by selecting the items in the attributes. To download the searched dataset, the user clicks the item in the result list and the request is jumped to the appropriate data node. The data node serves the datasets through the THREDDS data server and/or GridFTP server[9].

Through the ESG portal site the user can also obtain the script to download searched datasets. At present 14 index nodes and 25 data nodes are working in the world.

2) Access log The access record through the THREDDS data server is  described into the log file when the transaction starts and ends. At the time of the start, timestamp, remote host IP address, request ID, target of request etc. are described and at the end of the transaction, timestamp, status code, transferred data size etc. are described. These records are described into a single file including error information. Accordingly, for a single transaction, two records are described at the start and at the end. These records can be matched by the request ID.

The request is continuing when only the record of starting is described in the log file. The access histories are also recorded into the ESG management database system, however, the recorded items are different between the log file and the database system.   Some items are stored on either of them. Therefore, to obtain whole information about the access, it is necessary to retrieve the information from both log file and database system and to match them by the timestamp, the remote host IP address and the target file name.

3) DIAS as the ESG data node     Data Integration and Analysis System (DIAS) at the University of Tokyo in Japan works as the data node of ESG and it provides the all original CMIP5 datasets generated by the data provider groups in Japan. The data provider groups send their CMIP5 datasets to DIAS and they are archived in DIAS. The stored CMIP5 datasets are published through the THREDDS data server. From Japan, the CMIP5 datasets by 3 institutes and 9 models are published and additionally the datasets in the other activities as TAMPI, LUCID and GeoMIP. DIAS started providing the CMIP5 data as the ESG data node on September in 2011 and currently, 890,000 files, 7,200 datasets and 420TB CMIP5 data are served through DIAS approximately. The total amount of the CMIP5 data served through the all ESG nodes is about 1.9PB and DIAS is the largest data node in the ESG system.



III. SYSTEM FOR SURVEYING OF CMIP5  Figure 1. Multi-dimensional dataset browser  CMIP5 dataset has multi-dimensional structure as described in II.A, however the files do not distribute equally in the multi-dimensional space. The existence of files or the number of files depends on the attributes such as the model, experiment and so on. On the other hand, the user requires the groups of files with the same attribute values except a few attribute values in order to compare the difference of the simulation results and to evaluate the effect of the difference between the attribute values. The ESG portal site only provides with the interface that shows the lists of the search results and in it the user can select only one item per one attribute. Therefore the result list is not all the same as what the user requires. For example, if the user requires the datasets of ?rcp26? experiment and ?rcp45? experiment, it is necessary to search the dataset of ?rcp26? and those of ?rcp45? separately. In some case the dataset of ?rcp26? does not exist even if the dataset of ?rcp45? exist. It is not easy for the users to understand the availability of comparable files through the interface. To help these situations, we are constructing the multi-dimensional dataset browser.

Figure 1 shows the window of the multi-dimensional dataset browser. In this interface, the user can select any combination of item values in an attribute. The numbers of files matching with the selected item values are shown in the table blow the item value selection field in the same window adding to the total number of files and amount. The user can assign any attribute as X and Y axis. To drill down the search results, clicking the cell in the table shows the list of matched files. The DIAS does not have the index node of ESG and therefore, it takes a long time to obtain the catalog from the index node of ESG far from DIAS. Accordingly, for this browser the server in DIAS collects CMIP5 data inventory from the index node of ESG periodically and stores them into its own database system independent of user requests. Since the browser is implemented in JavaScript, almost all web browsers can be used. First, the system reads the list of attributes from the configure file, retrieves the all candidate values from the database and shows them with the check boxes. According as the user checks/unchecks them, the system generates the query corresponding to the selected item values and the attribute names as X and Y axis,  executes it and displays the result value into each cell in the table asynchronously.



IV. SYSTEM FOR SURVEYING OF ACCESS LOG  A. 3 Dimensional Visualization of Access Log DIAS has been received more than 1,900,000 requests  except those with error status until now and the published CMIP5 datasets through DIAS have many kinds of attribute values. Since it is difficult to understand the request pattern, we are constructing the 3 dimensional visualization system to survey the pattern of the access requests for the administrators in DIAS.

Figure 2. 3 dimensional visualization system. Figure 4. Request tracing function of 3 dimensional visualization system  Figure 3. Filtering function of 3 dimensional visualization system.

The system is implemented using WWW server-client  mechanisms. In the server side the system collects the ESG access request information from the ESG access log file and the management database system in ESG and stores them into its own database system. When the server side system receives the request from the client after authentication, it retrieves the ESG access request information from the database system according to the client request and sends  back them to the client. The client visualizes the received access request information. The client system is implemented in JavaScript, Dojo Toolkit and WebGL.

Accordingly, the client system works in many web browsers without any special plug-ins.

Figure 2 shows the window of the client of the 3 dimensional visualization system. In this window the user can assign the CMIP5 data attributes, the remote host and the time to X, Y and Z axis. The client displays each request as a cube according to the assigned axis. When the CMIP5 data attributes and the remote host are assigned as the axis, the user can specify the alphabetic order, the order of access requests or the order of transferred amount. The color of the cubes can be specified same as the axis. The focused time is specified and when the request was active at the focused time, the corresponding cube is represented in bright color. The focused time can be input in direct, can be selected through the calendar window or can be pointed by the slide bar. To improve the recognition, the vertical plane to each axis can be displayed.

B. Filtering Function The user can filter out the selected attribute items from  the targets of visualization as shown in figure 3. DIAS provides more than 300 kinds of variables and has received the requests from more than 600 users and 1,000 hosts. To display all requests in the specified period makes the focusing requests ambiguous. To eliminate the unnecessary access requests improves the recognizability.

C. Request Trace Function The 3 dimensional visualization system has request  tracing function to animate the visualized image moving the     focused time backward or forward. Figure 4 shows the window image with request tracing function. In figure 4, the user set time as X axis, remote hosts as Y axis and variables as Z axis. Using request tracing function, as the focused time moves, the cubes representing accessed requests become bright. Following the movement of bright cubes makes the user to understand the behavior of request sequence.



V. RELATED WORKS The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) is the database  system of astronomical observation[10]. The SDSS has many kinds of interfaces including that for directly submitting a SQL query. The SDSS does not always aim at comparing the observed images each other repeatedly.

Therefore, the SDSS does not have the interface to show the number of categorized images as a table based on user?s definition, though the user can obtain such number by submitting SQL query.

There are many commercial and non-commercial analysis tools for web logs[11][12][13][14]. These tools show the bar charts or pie charts of statistics of access requests. Some of them display more detailed reports of user behavior. However, the main target for them is not data server but ordinary web site; they do not take account of the stored data structure. They do not categorize or summarize the transferred data based on multi-dimensional data attributes. In addition, they do not have the animated request trace function.



VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we introduced the visualization systems for  surveying global climate change simulation datasets and access requests for them. At first, we explained the CMIP5 datasets in brief and then introduced the two visualization systems. First one is the system to display the matrix of the datasets where the user can set any attributes as axis to understand the distribution of the datasets. The second one is the 3 dimensional visualization system of the access requests to recognize the access pattern to the datasets. These systems are not special for the CMIP5 and they can be applied easily to multi-dimensional datasets. Most of large scientific dataset has multi-dimensional structure, therefore, these system might be useful for them.
