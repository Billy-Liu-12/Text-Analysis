Technologies and Networks Supporting Maritime Wireless Mesh Communications

Abstract?The recent advances in wireless mesh communi- cations technologies have given the rise to evolve maritime wireless mesh networks (MWMNs). Maritime users require more high data rate applications, where the cost associated with the conventional satellite and the legacy systems that provide low data rate applications have posed major limitations for the emergence of MWMNs. Besides, the network architecture and protocol design remain big challenges in coping with the different ship mobility patterns and with the numerous navigational scenarios in the maritime environment. Most of the research studies [1], [2] have focused on the development of maritime communications technologies, where less attention has been considered to provide a realistic and reliable framework to implement a network that can satisfy maritime users? requirements. This paper provides a detailed research study (an in-depth overview) on maritime communications technologies which can be deployed for imple- menting reliable and resilient maritime wireless mesh networks.

Comprehensive guidelines are outlined to easily understand and critically assess the different deployed maritime communications networks, and identify the milestones in the process of developing MWMNs. Wireless service providers will use the outcome of this research research in expanding their communications infrastruc- ture to the maritime environment.



I. INTRODUCTION  Maritime communications technology is a growing area of interest for both academia and industry point-of-view.

The unprecedented development of maritime network appli- cations and the fast emergence of wireless communications technologies necessitate more advanced and reliable commu- nications network architectures to offer the increasing and diverse communications requirements that can satisfy maritime network applications and users [3]. Note also despite the advances in satellite-based networks connectivity, resulting in higher speed, reduced size, and lower cost electronic, satellite communications remain expensive due to the cost of launching satellites into orbit and the required stabilizers for on-board antennas. In addition, legacy ultra-high frequency (UHF) and very-high frequency (VHF) based maritime communications networks have small capacity and cannot support high data rate applications [4]. Within these circumstances, the basic maritime mesh networks can only support simple applications, such as text messaging, email, video, web surfing, collab- orative planning voice, and automatic identification system (AIS) [5], [6], [7]. However, maritime business applications show a steep ramp in the use of enterprize resource planing associated with increased use of onboard ship management systems for logistic, surveillance, telephony or email applica- tions. There is also increased security and other transport ori-  ented applications onboard ships, which increase the require- ments for guaranteeing high-speed and ubiquitous maritime communications. More shipping companies are improving the living conditions of their staff by offering staff social communications and interaction with external world during their time onboard ships. These ever increasing business and social networks needs cannot be satisfied with the conventional communications media such as satellites and legacy systems, both from the data rate and cost perspectives.

The authors of [2] introduce a research study which focuses on using wireless mesh technology [8] to extend the high bit-rate and low delay terrestrial communications networks to cover water environments (e.g., sea and ocean) to support maritime networks applications requiring larger bandwidth, while reducing the cost of maritime communications and their operation as well as management. Fig. 1 depicts a typical mesh network which extends the terrestrial networks further in a water environment through mesh network using multi-hop connections.

Mesh networks [8] are regularly distributed networks that generally allow transmission only to a node?s nearest neigh- bors. The mesh networks can also be referred to as peer-to- peer networks, since the network nodes are assumed to be identical. Even though all nodes may be identical and have the same computing and transmission functionalities, certain mesh nodes can be designated as mesh group leaders which then take  This regular paper was presented as part of the main technical program at IFIP WMNC'2013     on additional leadership functions to form a mesh network. If a group leader is suddenly disabled, another node will then inherit, and take over these group leadership duties, recovering the disabled network in a real-time fashion. Mesh networks are, therefore, good models for expanding existing terrestrial networks to form large-scale maritime networks which are distributed over a wide range with buoys.

To maintain backward compatibility with the existing mar- itime communications deployment and guarantee reliable mar- itime communications, legacy maritime communications sys- tems are integrated as part of maritime wireless mesh networks (MWMNs). The goal is to build an integrated maritime com- munications network in which mesh and satellite as well as ra- dio communications resources can be used in an optimum way to provide the best possible overall communications capability for maritime users [9]. The TRITON network [10], [11] has developed ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore mesh network that provides an alternative high-speed communications network which can operate reasonably well in busy shipping lanes, narrow water channels and traffic lanes close to shorelines.

In TRITON, the coverage extension is achieved by forming a wireless multi-hop network amongst neighboring ships, marine beacons and buoys using wireless communications technology (WiMAX) [10]. The multi-hop wireless network is connected to the terrestrial networks via land stations, which are placed at regular intervals along the shoreline. The TRITON network resembles a vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) but with some unique characteristics given by the distinct ship mobility pat- tern, position awareness of neighboring ships via the automatic identification system (AIS), wave rocking movement and wave occlusion due to sea surface.

A nautical ad-hoc network (NANET) has shown a possi- bility of forming mesh and/or ad-hoc network in the case of establishing maritime networks on (near) the shore or in the ocean [12]. The proposed network considers specific factors for maritime communications, such as mobility and route of the ship, ship density on the sea, and ocean wave fluctuation.

Maritime communications network is basically a heterogenous network which may consist of cellular communications and satellite mobile communications such as integrated wireless maritime communications network (IWMCN) [13]. Maritime- Manet is introduced as a network concept for communications between maritime platforms such as vessels, commercial ships or buoys. The network is based on multiple directive antennas for transmission, which is the key difference from the con- ventional approach to the ad-hoc networks that uses omni- directional antennas. The former approach provides much longer transmission range in the maritime environment [14].

Another example of the maritime communications network is the MarCom network [15], which aims at developing an inno- vative digital communications system to overcome the lagging of mobile network applications in the maritime environment.

The main objectives of the MarCom project are to extend the network coverage and range at sea for the conventional and novel terrestrial wireless systems and technologies, inte- grate digital satellite communications (SATCOM) to provide  coverage beyond the terrestrial capability and obtain smooth transition between the systems.

There are several maritime safety and security systems mandated by the international maritime organization (IMO).

These systems include AIS and the global maritime distress and safety system (GMDSS). The GMDSS allows a ship to send a message if it is in danger through several means to en- sure a due manner response. The GMDSS is a heterogeneous system which uses medium frequency (MF), high frequency (HF), VHF and maritime satellite (COSPAT-SARSAT) [16].

The mentioned systems have low bandwidth, which limits the exchange of data to the extend of transferring essential navigation data required to improve safety and security at sea. E-navigation has been proposed by the IMO to enhance safety, security and protection of the maritime environment.

The concept utilizes electronic mean to improve the collection, integration, exchange, presentation and analysis of maritime information. The e-navigation requires a high-speed and cost- effective maritime wireless communications link to be a successful radical departure from the conventional maritime communications systems [8]. Table I summarizes the different maritime systems and networks with their communications standards and technologies.

The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section II investigates maritime communications networks challenges.

Section III reviews in-depth the different proposed networks and systems. Section IV draws conclusions to this paper and outlines some future research directions.



II. CHALLENGES IN MARITIME COMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS  As discussed above in Section I, maritime networks widely face challenges compared to the terrestrial networks, which have much higher data rates and different mobility patterns.

Thus, building a robust maritime communications network face numerous challenges, such as:  - Low bandwidth environment: The current maritime net- works are prone to congestion given the needs for high bandwidth networks to support a multitude of communi- cations applications such as large file transfer, VoIP, video conference and high-speed web surfing. As the most obvious option, internet connectivity onboard ships is provided through SATCOM For military and surveillance applications, a high bandwidth network will enable rapid exchange of location awareness to tackle the problem of piracy, intrusion, distress and dispatch management.

To achieve efficient and effective location awareness, video surveillance cameras would be required along the shores, ships and beacons at sea. The requirement for high bandwidth is also crucial for the petroleum and gas companies to interlink their supply ships, floating terminals, petroleum and gas installations, etc. when the proximity among them is entitled [11].

- Rapid network reconfiguration: The aim of traffic en- gineering (TE) is to optimize the conflicting data ex- change requirements efficiently through the readily avail- able communications technologies. To fully understand the traffic characteristics of maritime networks and the consequence of TE schemes, an accurate traffic model is essential. The typical application types in the maritime networks are: internet surfing, image and video transfer, email, messaging services and VoIP. Rapid network re- configuration is required due to the frequent change of the critical traffic streams and the relative significant of different traffic types [1].

- Cost-effective communications: As previously mentioned, one of the most compelling challenge is the cost associ- ated to the maritime communications through SATCOM.

The unavailability of high bit rate terrestrial communica- tions to ships in sea yields the dependency on costly satel- lite links. Furthermore, the unavoidably high latency over 500 millisecond indicates the unsuitability of satellite connectivity for real-time applications. To further reduce the overall spending cost, shipping companies install data files compression software onboard ships to send them via SATCOM. Generally, expensive satellite equipment cannot be afforded by different operators. Therefore, cost- effective communications constitute a corner angle for the maritime networks [19],[20].

- Secured and private communications: One of the ma- jor concerns in tactical networks is to have secured and private communications. Data integrity, confidential- ity and authentication of network operations should be considered when developing a maritime network. Since wireless mediums are being utilized in developing such a network, the probability of messages being resent, intercepted, and protocols subverted requires protection of maritime network to cope with denial of service attacks and sensitive data routing through un-trusted devices. For  specific military and surveillance operations, a proprietary ad-hoc network or a dedicated frequency channel for securely conveying the data is paramount [21].

- Compatibility with currently in use communications sys- tems: The integration of new technologies should support the communications with equipment and systems already deployed. A transition phase is needed, when introducing any new technologies. Since, most of maritime com- munications systems are based on legacy systems and SATCOM, the transition phase will likely be soft, while initiating MWMNs.

- Mobility Management: Several wireless communications technologies are co-existed in the MWMNs. Hence, vertical handover will occur to the always best con- nected technology. A challenging issue is to maintain a continuous land communications for efficient mobility management. In the maritime environment context, ship mobility pattern and the sea movement will affect the wireless communications. Instability of signal reception and quality onboard ships is caused by the constant sea motion, which causes the communications antenna to fluctuate. The sea surface which is rough and random reflects the wireless signals and the reflected signal will interfere with the other traveling signals in the air. The wave tides and occlusions could break the communica- tions links. To build a MWMNs, ship mobility pattern has to be included as ships normally need a much longer time to turn, accelerate and decelerated to a new steady state speed [21],[22].

- Physical layer perspective: The feasibility of extension of the terrestrial wireless communications to the sea should encounter the characteristics of radio signal propagation model at the sea, the employment of active, passive or re- generative repeaters, mobile multi-hop relay (MMR) and mesh/ad-hoc networking. The system design relies on the accurate prediction of the radio propagation model. For shore scenario, physical layer exhibits different structure from its land counterpart. Reliable radio channel models for propagation over sea are essential for precise coverage and range predictions, and appropriate improvement of antenna system. The radio frequency spectrum allocation presents a crucial limitation for the maritime applications.

The international telecommunication union (ITU) has released the 450-470 MHz and 698-862 MHz frequency bands as the migration from the analogue to digital terrestrial TV. These frequency bands facilitate the devel- opment of low cost radio equipment with reasonable size and weight. Consequently, The UHF (698-862 MHz)is a target band by the WiMAX forum, and the sub-GHz WiMAX bands are already commercially deployed. The exploitation of sub-GHz frequencies will motivate the coverage and range extension of the terrestrial wireless communications system to the sea. Another stimulator is the economical advantage from deploying 2 base stations to cover the same at 450 MHz compared to 30 base stations at 3.5 GHz [4]. The propagation model, doppler    shift, and the signal reflections/variations are the common challenges for robust and effective transmission of data.



III. MARITIME WIRELESS MESH NETWORKS AND SYSTEMS  Traditionally, maritime networks are useful in naval task group deployments, but they are equally applicable to other maritime activities such as commercial fishing, shipping, emer- gency operations, or coast guard duties [3]. Typically, as shown in Fig. 2, for such deployment, a relatively small number of maritime nodes (ships) are dispatched in small groups.

A satellite ground base station installed on a shore provides access to server-based application services and act as a satellite switching center [23]. Basic maritime mesh networks consist of a network operational center (NOC) acting as a land-based relay for all satellite communications, a limited number of mobile nodes (ships or potentially maritime land/air units), and the links connecting them. The communications links available to transfer information within the network include ship-to- shore satellite networks (e.g., super-high frequency (SHF) and (SATCOM)), commercial satellite (e.g., INMARSAT B), high- frequency (HF) beyond line-of-sight (BLOS), HF extended LOS (ELOS), and UHF/VHF line-of-sight (LOS).

Fig. 2. Satellite based basic maritime mesh network.

Most nodes in maritime networks communicate using a combination of two communications modes [23], [1]. First, network nodes may communicate back to their home network via the NOC using satellite communications which can also be relayed at the NOC to provide indirect ship-to-ship commu- nications. Satellite communications provide high-bandwidth but high-delay and high-cost communications [24]. Second, ships communicate directly with other ships via limited range radio. The UHF/VHF relay technology has been improved to the point that LOS radio systems may form mobile ad- hoc networks (MANETs) [25]. In PACTOR-III, the MF/HF bands modem can cover up to 40, 000 km with the data rate of 9.6 kbps, whereas the typical coverage for VHF band modem is 4, 000 km with the data rate of 14.4 kbps [26].

If one ship has neighboring ships within 30 km, a mesh or an ad-hoc network can be formed using multi-hop communi- cations. But, if there is no neighboring ships within 30 km,  it is impossible to form mesh or ad-hoc network. Since the allocation of the VHF band for maritime communications in the 2007 world radiocommunication conference (WRC) [4], new maritime communication systems have been developed in addition to AIS [26]. AIS is a telematic system in the maritime environment which performs automatic data exchange among ships mainly used as an additive source of information for collision avoidance by ships, ship identification by shore- based vessel traffic services (VTS) and ship location. AIS automatically and periodically broadcast static and dynamic data of ships, such as position, velocity, length of the ship, destination port, and expected time of arrival as well as short short safety messages. PACTOR-III is an example of maritime communications systems which use MF/HF band with typical coverage range 4, 000-40, 000 km [18], [27]. AIS also uses VHF band, which adopts self-organized time division multiple access (SOTDMA) to prevent collision and provides safety voyage by transporting the information about the ships. The maritime communications systems which use MF/HF and VHF bands enjoy the advantage of long transmission distance without the support of high data rate service [28].

The maritime wireless mesh network that enables the ex- tension of the terrestrial network to the sea will complement or replace the existing high-cost satellite communications. In highly dense harbors and navigation channels, ships mobility is restricted by shipping lane directions and traffic laws.

Ships can skew at pre-assigned areas within a fixed minimum and maximum speed shipping lane. The shipping lanes will strict the network topology. Ships have rich power supply for onboard communications and localization equipment [22].

Wireless mesh network (WMN), which is a communications network made up of radio nodes structured in a mesh topology, has emerged as a key technology for next-generation wireless networking [4]. Industrial standards, such as IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.16, are all actively working on new specifications for WMNs. A WMN also provides basic networking infrastructure for communications in maritime mesh network. Some of the benefits of using WMNs in maritime wireless mesh networks are highlighted as follows:  ? Increased communications reliability and automatic net- work connectivity: Since redundant paths usually exit in WMNs, network robustness against potential problems, e.g., node failures and path failures can be improved. Fur- thermore, generally speaking, a WMN is self-organized and self-configured. This feature is crucial for maritime communications networks automation, since it enables MWMNs to cope with new connectivity requirements driven by maritime nodes demands.

? Large coverage and high data rate: WiMAX mesh net- work can enable both long distance and high data rate communications. The IEEE 802.16 is a wireless broad- band standard designed for long range wireless metropoli- tan area network (WMAN). In MWMNs, a large amount of critical information and social activities onboard ships is exchanged. Therefore, a communications network with large coverage and high data rate is necessary.

Technically, maritime networks and wireless mesh network (WMN) are two different concepts. In the physical layer, IEEE 802.16 uses OFDM and at the media access control (MAC) layer, the channel access is performed by time- division-multiple-access (TDMA). A mesh network supported by the standard (e.g. IEEE 802.16d) allows network node to communicate directly with each other without the coordina- tion of the base station even if the network nodes are not within the coverage of the base station. A wireless multi- hop network can be created, since the network nodes will cooperate in data exchange. In terrestrial wireless systems, the base stations installation will help in deploying the network.

However, the same approach cannot be implemented at sea where the ships can be scattered. The frame structure of the mesh networking consists of a control sub-frame and data sub-frame. The control messages will be conveyed in the control sub-frame in a free-collision scheduling mechanism.

The data sub-frame is divided into 256 slots. The transmission time for each packet has to be defined before relaying out the packet. The definition of transmission time is based on a distributed or a centralized algorithm. In the distributed scheduling algorithm, network nodes forward their resource allocation bitmap through control packet. Avoiding contention and interference in data exchange is achieved by three-way handshake manner which is based on the resource allocation information. In the three-way handshake resource allocation manner, the transmitter node sends a bandwidth request to the receiver node initially; the receiver node responds by allocating the resources according to the resource bitmap and sends back the endowment allocation. Upon receiving the reply from the receiver node, the transmitter node rebroadcasts the allocated resources to its neighbors for collision and interference mitigation. The resource allocation bitmap will be updated for the nodes receiving the grant or grant confirmation.

In the centralized scheduling algorithm, the network node sends a bandwidth request to its respective base station. Then, the base station will send the allocated time slot resources to the corresponding nodes. The centralized scheduling algorithm allows resource allocation via multi-hop. The network nodes relay bandwidth request and acquire information for other network nodes. Generally, delays will be associated to the bandwidth allocation if the requesting network node is further away from the base station. The concentration of the routing tree will affect the selection of the scheduling algorithm.

If the tree is not large, centralized scheduling algorithm is better. However, if the routing tree is deep, then distributed scheduling algorithm is better due to the associated delay of the centralized scheduling algorithm [29].

The following sub-sections introduce networks which use WMN technology to extend the terrestrial network to the sea environment and support reliable maritime communications.

A. Nautical Ad-hoc Network  A typical coverage for a base station provides optimum transmission with a single hop. Therefore, the present cellular systems or wireless point-to-point systems will only benefit  ships in certain circumstances such as busy ports and narrow navigation channels. Mesh technology addresses the coverage of ships beyond the cellular systems capability. Recently, mesh technology has been actively researched for the terrestrial mobile wireless systems. There are several standards that adopt mesh technology in IEEE. However, the empirical application of these standards in maritime environment has not been widely deployed. As a result of a conducted market study that relies on real ship mobility model, the transmission range of a well-connected mesh network is at least 18 km. IEEE 802.16 mesh standard is released for a wireless metropolitan access network (MAN) with a typical coverage that can vary to 50 km. From a coverage prospective, this standard is suitable for the maritime mesh network. The result of some conducted research experiments show that, given an antenna height of 16 m and IEEE 802.16e, broadband transmission in a maritime ship-to-ship environment can stand up to 45 km [8].

If a ship is surrounded by another within 30 km, a mesh/ad- hoc network can be created using VHF modem to build multi- hop network connections. However, if no ship falls within its coverage 30 km, then it is not possible to form the mesh or ad-hoc network. As a result, MF/HF modem activates dual- mode operation, which can cover up to 40, 000 km with the data rate of 9.6 kbps. Through three different nautical ad- hoc network (NANET) configuration scenarios, this network is configured on harbor, shore, and in ocean. A NANET covers a harbor using an existing terrestrial communications network which can be extended by installing base stations across the coast. Ships under the coverage of a base station on a shore can directly communicate with this base station. If, however, the ship is located outside the coverage of the base station, i.e.

there is no direct link to the base station, then a mesh network can be formed with other ships/buyos to reach the base station [12]. As mentioned above that the mesh network can be implemented with various wireless and radio communications technologies, such as IEEE 802.11, WiMAX IEEE 802.16e, and long-term evolution cellular network (LTE).

When ships are faraway from the shore in the ocean, they cannot reach the base stations on the coast, and henceforth ships through mesh networks can establish peer-to-peer com- munications to reach the base stations. Note that if there are no ships within the ship?s coverage distance of the VHF modem, then the existing MF/HF modem can be employed which can allow a transmission distance up to 40, 000 km, so that a direct communications with the base station can be achieved [12]. In the NANET architecture, the difference between mesh, and ad-hoc network is the existence of the base station under the former approach. However, the low coverage of the VHF modem will hinder the establishment of the mesh/ad-hoc network. Therefore, the dependency on MF/HF in this network for the ocean scenario limits the practical implementation of NANET.

B. TRITON High Speed Maritime Mesh Network  TRITON network devises a novel maritime architecture for establishing a high bandwidth maritime network which    can guarantee the QoS levels required for maritime nodes in busy and narrow shipping lanes along the coastal areas.

TRITON network is based on a market survey compiled from different potential users ranging from commercial vessels, petroleum enterprizes to civilian sea transportation ships to collect the requirements needed for a feasible maritime broad- band wireless network. The WiMAX wireless technology is used in the network core architecture to establish a multi- hop maritime mesh network among neighboring ships, marine lighthouses and buoys [10]. The maritime mesh network is integrated with the terrestrial networks through base stations placed along the coast at regular intervals. A maritime node (ship) carries a configurable mesh radio device which has the capability of switching the operating frequency depending on the geographical locations or sea conditions. When these nodes are getting nearby port waters, the operating frequencies are limited to the terrestrial base stations. Satellite is integrated with the conceived architecture to provide communications for low distribution of ships, since the mesh network is ideal for sufficient ships. This, however, places limitation when there is a low distribution of ships, hence, the relaying transmission medium will be switched to a satellite link. A continues link quality measurement is performed and a switching middle- ware automatically switches the link based on the provided measurement since acceptable QoS level is the desired aim of the network.

C. Integrated Wireless Maritime Communication Network  The proposed integrated wireless maritime communication network (IWMCN) is composed of two parts: cellular commu- nications part and satellite mobile communications part. This enables network nodes to communicate among them using cellular communications or satellite mobile network through a network gateway. Based on this maritime wireless commu- nications network, a number of maritime systems have been developed to reliably support maritime communications. An integrated maritime service system (IMSS) provides various value-added services such as navigation, distress warning, voice communications, positioning, weather forecasting, and recreation. Users mobility is managed through virtual home environment (VHE) in 3G-IP multimedia sub-system (IMS).

VHE is a concept of personal service environment portability among network boundaries and between terminals. In VHE, within the capabilities of any network and any terminal, users are presented with the same personalized attributes, user interface customization and services wherever the user is located. Concerning VHE services, user data profile is stored in home subscriber server (HSS). Aligning with the subscriber profiles, HSS performs authorization and authentication of the user, provides information about the location of the subscriber and IP information. The positions of mobile users onboard can be supplied to HSS through onboard satellite gateway and satellite network [13]. In the IWMCN architecture, ships forming an ad-hoc network considered as a transit network in the ship-to-shore communications network and transmission network in ship-to-ship communications network. A satellite  is connected to an ad-hoc ship network via shipbone satellite gateway (SGW), and connects to the cellular communications system via terrestrial gateway (TGW). The IEEE 802.11s wireless mesh network standard is used to implement ship- to-ship ad hoc network.

The IEEE 802.11 standard enables mesh clients to com- municate directly with each another and access the network through multiple mesh access points (MAPs). Different net- work domains can be connected through MAPs which estab- lish mesh links with each other over the path determined by a routing protocol. A hybrid wireless mesh protocol (HWMP) based on ad-hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) and tree-based routing is considered as the default protocol in IEEE 802.11s [30]. To form an ad-hoc network among ships, initially, each ship sets up a MAP, where a single-hop wireless link is created among neighboring ships.

MAPs transmit at adjustable power according to the quality of the path among adjacent MAPs to enable radio signals to reach neighbor MAPs. When an ad-hoc network is formed among ships, data exchange can be performed through stan- dard IP protocol and ship-to-ship voice and video communi- cations can be established. Ships can be equipped with a po- sitioning system such as GPS or GALILEO receiver terminal integrated with electronic chart display and information system (ECDIS) which sends positioning information to other ships within ad-hoc network connecting ships. The selection of the communications system is based on the service requirements for ship-to-shore or ship-to-ship communications, which de- pends mainly on the condition of the each communications system within the network and the location of the ships.

Algorithm 1 summarizes the selection of communications system procedure [13].

Algorithm 1 Selection of communications system in IWMCN (s, v, cs, sn) ? Ship, VANET, cellular system, and satellite network 1: if s ? v then 2: v(s) ? VANET is used 3: else 4: if v ? cs then 5: v(cs) ? cellular system is used 6: else 7: v(sn) ? satellite network is used 8: end if 10: end if  For ship-to-ship communications, if the mobile user is within VANET between ships, then VANET will be selected to establish a connection. For ship-to-shore communications, if the mobile user is within the coverage of the cellular system, then a radio link can be established using cellular system.

However, if the user is not within the coverage of the cellular system, the satellite network will be utilized to establish a connection. IWMCN depends on the coverage of the cellular system to reduce the usage of the satellite system. Hence, in the ocean scenario, i.e. when the mobile user is far away from    the shore and if the cellular system does not take into account to optimize its coverage extension to the sea, the involvement of the satellite network will increase the cost associated to this network. Another drawback of IWMCN is when a connection needs to be established for ship-to-ship communications and when the mobile user is not located within VANET, then how the IWMCN will handle the selection of the communications link?.

D. MaritimeManet  A distributed surveillance application can be deployed in MaritimeManet network which provides uninterrupted surveil- lance over a large maritime area of responsibility (AoR). The distributed surveillance application called sensors in concert (SiC) has been developed due to the inefficient and expensive existing maritime surface surveillance using satellites, mar- itime petroleum aerial vehicles, or multiple navy vessels [31].

SiC nodes create SiC systems, each node senses its surround- ings up to 18 km using radar, automatic identification system, optionally equipment operator (EO), and passive sonar to communicate with its neighboring nodes to exchange sensor data and integrates its own sensor data with the other received sensors data using MaritimeManet [32].

SiC nodes can be conveyed over buoys, relatively small navy vessels, unmanned surface vehicles (USV), commercial ships, or oil rigs. SiC nodes should be placed at sufficient height so that the optical horizon complements the sensing range to achieve suitable spatial deployment which results in continuous and full coverage of area-of-responsibility (AoR) even when islands exist. To enable SiC, maritime nodes should be able to communicate in an ad-hoc network manner. The underlining protocol of SiC nodes operates in three parts: The distribution middleware sub-system (transport layer), the ad-hoc IP (MANET, SSM, DiffServ) sub-system (network layer), and the transmission sub-system (data link and physical layers). A publish-subscriber data-oriented distribution mid- dleware provides interconnection between different application processes. In the network layer, an ad-hoc routing protocol is used jointly with other IP forwarding capabilities such as protocol independent multi-casting with source specific multicast (PIM-SSM), and differentiated services (DiffServ).

With a novel approach of neighbors? discovery, LOS com- munications between nodes relies on multi-beam antennas. For beyond line-of-sight (BLOS) communications, an alternative wireless technology based on HF and near vertical indices skywave (NVIS) antenna is used when LOS is not supporting a connected network. The ad-hoc routing protocol will be defined by one of the available routing protocols of MANET.

Obviously, nodes are located on surface platforms with fairly moderate speed and non rapid changes in the network typol- ogy. To optimize routing protocol, modifications have to be applied to a proactive protocol such as open link state routing (OLSR)  In MaritimeManet each node transmits data to the nodes when they need it. The coordination and forwarding methods for data transmission can be configured using existing IP capa-  bilities [33]. In the distribution middleware, a node publishes its data types defined by data model and irrespective of the designed system to other nodes which can show interest in one or more of them.

The source-specific multi-cast (SSM) [34] is the bearer for data dissemination where a unique data delivery channel is created by the IP-address of the source and the group addresses. Also data types are uniquely mapped to group addresses. Deficiency arises as this method operates well only in systems with multiple nodes having the same capabilities such as SiC despite that, SSM uses multicast forwarding which is utilized for communications sessions between two nodes [14]. SSM must be activated in the network in order to use the source address and the group addresses channels.

Therefore, internet group management protocol (IGMP) is essential to permit nodes to join and receive packets from a certain channel. The delivery tree for the group addresses will be formulated by SSM routing protocol. In order to use the channel, multicast forwarding is needed to exchange data.

By using SSM in state of the ordinary multicast where any node can send to a multicast group avoids the exploitation of complex multi-cast routing. In SSM, unicast routing protocol is adequate. In MaritimeManet, the loss and delay values for specific data types service quality that can be tolerated for each data type are achieved during forwarding in the network.

Based on the control bits in the packet header, DiffServ allows controlling over the buffering of packets. Prior to the packet forwarding over the network, a node maps the indicated loss and delay values to the best matching forwarding service and sets the controlling bit in the header. The control bits deal with the delay and discard priorities of the packet. During the transmission of the packet at each intermediate node, the control bits decide how packets are treated in the queue.

By doing this, simple and efficient service differentiation is achieved with applications while guaranteeing their QoS requirements.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTION  In this paper, we have discussed the wireless commu- nications technologies for building reliable maritime mesh networks while outlining the challenges and requirements for guaranteeing high quality maritime wireless mesh com- munications. The presented maritime communications net- works and systems provide ubiquitous maritime applications by integrating and expanding the terrestrial network with/to the maritime environment. This research study classifies the research work which has been done so far on maritime wireless mesh networks deployment and technologies. Generally, a maritime communications network should maintain backward compatibility with satellite and other maritime radio commu- nications to provide seamless handover in case of any network disruption or failure. As a next step in our research work we will be working on multi-hop routing for maritime wireless mesh networks with the aim to improve the transmission speed and reduce the cost of maritime communications.
