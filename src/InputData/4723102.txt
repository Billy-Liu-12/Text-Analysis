Keywords-Event; Formal concept analysis; Association  extraction; Intent reduction ?.INTRODUCTION Many philosophers believe that the world is material,  and the world is composed of object and event. Event is  specific facts, and object is the eternal nature of the event.

Different events have internal links between them [1]. Many  cognitive scientists believe that basic unit of human  proposition memory is event, and human brain stores the  event components as well as relationship of the stored events  [2]. In the field of artificial intelligence, in 1963 McCarthy  has put forward Situation Calculus, which is used to carry  out calculus on predicate [4]. Nowadays, event calculus  draws many scientists? attention [5-6].

Some cognitive scientists, study the structure of event  mainly from the brain's memory principles and structure of  the events. Zacks a researcher from Stanford University, his  research shows that an event is an action to the real world  observed by the spectators, which can be understood by time  series and casual link between event basic elements [3].

Norman and Lindsay put forward an integrated memory  model (Elinor model), which is also a network model,  composed by connecting nodes and components. In the  model nodes represent concept, events, scenarios, and links  between nodes are used to express proposition. Concepts are  formed by object and their links, and events are formed by  action concept and relation, and scenarios are formed by  events and different type of relations between events. In  Norman and Lindsay?s paper, there are two relations  between events, juxtaposition relation and followed-by  relation [2].

In the field of information retrieval, is considered as a  refinement of the search for the theme.  In topic  identification and tracking (TDT) conference sponsored by  U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  (DARPA), event is deemed as smaller than a topic and is  formed by several sub-events [7-8].This means that the  events closely links with time, events can be viewed from  different levels and can be described indifferent granularity.

Event description and analysis based on formal concept  analysis are presented to formally describe event and to  extract association rule between events in this paper.  It is  introduced formal context to describe events and their  occurring time period. Then establish concept lattice  according to the formal context. Finally extraction  association rule by using the established concept lattice.  ?. EVENT DESCRIPTION MODEL BASED ON FCA Formal concept analysis (FCA) after being produced by  professor R.Wille, its core structure concept lattice has  attracted broad attention and being used in various fields.

Concept lattice is a concept hierarchy structure which is  established according to the binary mapping between objects  and attributes, vividly embodies the concept of the  generalized and specialized relations [9].

Definition 1: If an event from start to finish has no  partitions, so that it is said to be sustained, otherwise it is  said to be intermittent. @ is a binary relation, E@T means  that event E occurs at time period T, and is also formally  denoted as <E,T>.

Definition 2: A region c=[a,b] is a real number  set{x:a?x?b}, then a is called an interval number. If a=b,  then [a,b] is called a degrade interval, and is denoted by a  number a [10].

Obviously, time can be naturally expressed by an  interval number. An event can be decomposed to several  sub-events, that is E={e1,e2,?,en}. If sub-event is sustained,  sub-event ei occurs at time [ti,ti?], and is denoted as ei@[ti,ti?].

If sub-event is intermittent, sub-event ei occurs at several  time periods, and is denoted as ei@[t1,t1?] [t? 2,t2?]?? [t? n,tn?].

Beginning time of event E  Tb(E)=min(Tb(ei)),i=1,2,?  ,n. Ending time of event E Te(E)=max(Te(ei), i=1,2,? ,n.

Definition 3: Interval number decomposition is a  binary function, which is denoted as ?, [a1,b1] ? [a2,b2]=I1,I2,I3=[a1,a2?b1], [a2,(a2 b? 1) b? 2],[(a2 b? 1) b? 2,b1 b? 2]. In this formula, ? and ? are binary function, and a?b means min(a,b) and a?b means max(a,b).

If after carrying out interval decomposition, we get  Ii=[a,b](i=1,2,3), there are three situation needs to be tackled.

a. if a=b, then [a,b] is a degrade interval, just delete it  directly.

b. if a>b, then [a,b] is not a interval number, just delete  it directly.

c. if we get same interval numbers, just keep one.

In the following, we give some interval number  decomposition examples.

[3,7] [3,7]=[3,7];? [3,7] [3,9]=[3,? 7],[7,9]; [3,7] [1,7]=[1,3],[3,7];? [3,7] [2,4]=[2,3],[3,4],[4,7];? [3,7] [5,9]=[3,5],[5,7],[7,9].? Definition 4: Time set T, which is composed of several  interval numbers, after carrying out interval number  decomposition, and event set E, and relation between T and   DOI 10.1109/CSSE.2008.117    DOI 10.1109/CSSE.2008.117     E, namely, @ ? T?E, T and E and @ form a triple K=(T,E,@), and then we call K a formal context.

Definition 5: Given sub-Time ? T and sub-Event? E, exist two mappings, f: 2  sub-Time ?2  sub-Event and g:  sub-Event  ?2 sub-Time  . If these two mappings satisfy  f(sub-Time)={sub-Event| ? sub-Event ? E, sub-Event@sub-Time} and g(sub-Event)={sub-Time|  ? sub-Time ? T, sub-Event@sub-Time}, and then we call f,g Galois link of a formal event context.

For the sake of convenient, mapping f and g are both  represented simply by symbol (?) . Given a concept c(A,B),  A? means f(A), B? means g(B). Thus we have A?=B, B?=A,  A??=A, B??=B.

Definition 6: Given formal event context K=(T,E,@)  and subsets sub-Time ? T and sub-Event ? E, if sub-Event=f(sub-Time) and sub-Time=g(sub-Event), then  we call (sub-Time, sub-Event) a formal event concept.

Sub-Time is called extent of a formal event concept, and  sub-Event is called intent of a formal event concept.

Definition 7: Given formal event context K=(T,E,@)  and two formal event concepts c1=(sub-Time1,sub-Event1)  and c2=(sub-Time2,sub-Event2), if sub-Time1 ? sub-Time2, we call c1 a sub concept of c2 , and c2 a super concept of c1,  and the relation between them is denoted as c1?c2. Relation ? and concepts set c(K) form hierarchy structure is called event concept lattice, and is denoted as L(T,E,@)=(c(k),?).

Example 1: Given event set E={a,b,c,d,e,f,g} and  relations: a@[0,3] [4,5],?  b@[1,6], c@[0,3] [4,7],? d@[5,6], e@[1,6], f@[5,6] and g@[1,3] [4,5] [6,7].? ? After carrying out interval number decomposition on time  set, we get intervals [0,1], [1,3], [3,4], [4,5], [5,6] and [6,7].

These interval numbers are denoted as t1, t2, t3, t4, t5 and t6.

The event formal context is shown in Table 1, and its  concept lattice is shown in Fig.1.

For example, if event a occurs, and at the  same time period event b will occur, and event a and  event b always has this relation, then an association is  founded, that is a?b.

3.1 Related Work  Association rule extraction based on FCA is by  computing intent reduction, via intent reduction association  rule can be found [11]. Xie defines minimal cover, and finds  the relation between minimal set cover and intent reduction,  at the end designs algorithm to compute intent reduction and  to find association rule [11].  The following definition and  theorem make up of Xie?s main idea.

Figure 1. Event formal concept lattice  Definition: Given set F={F1,F2,? ,Fn}, if G satisfies (1) ? Fi ? G (G?Fi? ? );(2) ? S ? G, ?  Fi ? G ,  S?Fi=? ,then G is called a minimal cover [11].

Theorem: Given a concept C=(A,B) and a sub-set  P ? B, P is an intent reduction of c if and only if P is a minimal cover set of {B-Bp|Cp=(Ap,Bp)}; Cp is a super  concept of C [11].

3.2 Intent Reduction  Definition 8: Given a formal event concept C=(T,E), if  set R satisfies (1) R?=E?=T;(2) if ? ? R1 ? R, then R1? ? R?, then R is an intent reduction of C [11].

Theorem 1: If concept P has super concepts  PF1,PF2,?,PFn, then intent reduction is bibj, bi and bj belongs  to PFi and PFj?s intent respectively, and bibj doesn?t belong to  any P?s super concept?s intent synchronously.

Prove: Let P.B represents concept P?s intent. Given  bi?PFi.B and bj?PFi.B, i?j,bibj?PFk.B(k=1,2,?,n), we can get (bibj)? ? P.B?. Beside this we have bibj ? PFk.B (k=1,2,?,n), then ((bibj)?,(bibj)??) doesn?t contain any super  concept of P, and this means ((bibj)?,(bibj)??) is not a super of  P, then we get (bibj)?=P.B?. Then this theorem is proved.

?  Deduction 1: If a concept P has only one super  concept PF, then intent reduction is b, and b?{P.B-PF.B}.

Algorithm 1: (CIR algorithm) Compute Intent  Reduction of a concept  Input: concept lattice L(T,E,@), concept P;  Output: intent reduction R of P;  Step1: initialize R=? ; Step2: find super concept of P, and store them as  F1,F2,? ,Fn. If n>1, carry out Step 4; otherwise, carry put Step 3;  Step3: compute D=P.B-PF.B, every element in D is an  intent reduction, then R {b|b? ?D}, goto step5;  #8  #6  #3  #9  #5  #7  #4  #2 2345,be 12456,c  245,bce 124,ac 246,cg  5,bcdef 24,abceg  ( ),abcdefg  #1 123456,( )     Step4: For i=1 to n-1  For j=i+1 to n  {  bi?PFi.B?bj?PFi.B? For k=1 to n  If {bi,bj} ? PFk.B? {bi,bj}is an intent reduction? R?{bi,bj}? }? Step5: return R, this algorithm is finished.

Using intent reduction of concepts, we can get  association rules. If R is an intent reduction of concept  C=(T,E) and R? E, then we can get an association rule R?E-R. An association rule means if event R occurs, event  E-R will occur.

Using CIR algorithm, we can get the following results  in Example 1.

#3 concept({1,2,4,5,6},{c}) : intent reduction is {c},  and no association is generated.

#4 concept({2,4,5},{b,c,e}): intent reduction are  {b,c}and {c,e}, and association rules bc?e and ce?b are  generated.

#8 concept({2,4},(a,b,c,e,g)): intent reduction are {a,b},  {a,e}, {a,g}, {b,g},and {e,g}, association rules ab?ceg,  ae?bcg, ag?bce, bg?ace, eg?abc.

The other concepts? intent reduction and extracted  association rules are omitted. Using Xie?s algorithm we can  get the same result.

3.3 CIR Algorithm Performance Analyses  Algorithm performance is estimated by the times of  carrying comparison of single element. When averagely  every concept has n super concepts and every concept has m  attributes, then CIR Algorithm complexity is O(mn2). In  order to compare CIR algorithm and Xie?s algorithm [11],  we do the following experiment.

Randomly generate a context, which has 300 rows  (object) and 30 columns (attribute), and probability of  existing relationship between object and attribute is 0.2.

Adopt Godin Algorithm [12] to generate concept lattice.

Then randomly select 50,100,150,200,250 concepts to  compute intent reduction. The experiment is carried on a  micro computer with P4 1.7GHz CPU and 256M memory.

The experiment result is shown in figure?, in which L1 shows Xie?s algorithm?s performance, and L2 shows CIR  algorithm?s performance.

Then produces a model based FCA to represent event,  which focus on event and its occur-time. On this model,  association rule extraction is studied, and compares two  different way to compute intent reduction.
