The newly derived minimum support value will thus be changed to ?j + ?. A new fuzzy membership function will also be created by addition of a random value ? to the center or to the spread of an existing linguistic term, say Rjk.

+ ? Mutation at the fuzzy membership  function may, however, disrupt the order of the resulting fuzzy membership functions. These fuzzy membership functions then need rearrangement according to their center values.
