The Representative Basis for Association Rules

Abstract  We dejne the concept of the representative basis for in- teresting association rules, and an inference system which is purely qualitative, The representative basis is unique, and minimal with respect to (wrt) the inference system. On the representative basis, the inference system is correct and complete. Experimental results show that the number of rules in the representative basis is sign$cantly reduced wrt the number of rules generated by other existing approaches.

1. Introduction  Faced with the exponential number of association rules extracted from a dataset, there is a trend searching for their concise representations, called generating sets or bases [ l ,  2,4, 61. A generating set is a small set of informative as- sociation rules from which all other interesting association rules can be derived. The concept of frequent closed item- sets [4, 61 is proposed as a theoretical basis for generating sets. These approaches have the main common points: ( i ) They distinguish the basis for exact rules from the basis for approximate rules. ( i i )  Rules that can be derived by tran- sitivity or augmentation are discarded from the basis. As consequences, the inference on these bases has to use tran- sitivity and augmentation. However, a rule derived by tran- sitivity is not always interesting. Computing the confidence of the derived rule, basing on the confidences of the rules in the basis, is necessary to know if it is interesting. A rule derived by augmentation (on the left- or right-hand sides) is not always interesting. Only the augmentation using items obtained by Galois closure operators [3] can ensure the in- terestingness of the derived rule. We argue that these com- putations are not evident to the end users.

We present an approach to generating set, called the representative basis, which is different from the above ap- proaches in these two points. In particular, we shall see the inference on the representative basis is very simple, and no  computation of the confidences or closures is needed.

2. Preliminaries  Association rules are extracted from a dataset 2) = ( 0 , Z , R )  where 0 is a finite set of objects, Z is a finite set of items, and R is a binary relation on 0 and Z. A sub- set I Z is called an itemset of V. For each 0 5 0 and each I C 1, let g ( I )  = {o E 0 I Vi E I ,  (0, i) E R}, and f(0) = {i  E Z I Vo E O , ( o , i )  E R}. Thecouple ( f , g ) is called a Galois connection [3] between 2O and 2?. The Galois closure operators are the compositions: h = f o g and h? = g o f .  Let I be an itemset of D, h ( I )  = f ( g ( I ) ) is called the closure of I .  Indeed, I 5 h ( I )  = h(h(1)).

An itemset I is closed if h ( I )  = I .  The support of I is sup( ] )  = card(g( l ) ) /card(O) ,  where card (X)  is the cardinality of X .  Given a support threshold, denoted by minsup,  0 5 minsup  5 1, an itemset I is frequent if sup(1)  2 minsup.  I is frequent closed if it is frequent and closed [ 1, 61. An itemset I is called a frequent key itemset [2] if there is no I? c I with sup(1?) = sup(1).

An association rule r is an expression of the form I1 + 12, where 11, I2 5 Z. The support and confidence of r , denoted by sup(r )  and conf ( r ) ,  respectively, are sup(r )  = sup(11 U I2), and c o n f ( r )  = sup(11 U I2) / sup( I1) .  If con f ( r )  = 1, then r is called an exact rule. Otherwise, T is called an approximate rule. Let minsup and rrzincon f be the thresholds for supports and confidences of associations rules, respectively. An association rule r is interesting if sup(r)  2 minsup and con f ( r )  2 mincon f .

Example 1. The left part of Table 1 represents a dataset; in the right part are the itemsets with their supports.

But wrt minsup = 315 and minconf = 415 these rules are not interesting.

Basis  424 1578 384 1221  Definition 1 The representative basis for  interesting asso- ciation rules extracted front a dataset 2, (called the repre- sentative basis of V, in short), wrt the thresholds minsup and mincon f ,  is the set of interesting association rules I -+ J such that I c J and there is no other interesting association rule I' + J' such that I' C I and J C: J'.

The representative basis of the dataset in Table 1, wrt minsup = 215 and mincon f = 112, consists of the fol- lowing rules: A -+ ABCE, B -+ ABCE, C -+ ABCE, E -+ ABCE, 0 -+ BCE, 0 -+ AC.

Proposition 1 The itemset on the right-hand side of every association rule in the representative basis is a frequent closed itemset.

Proposition 2 The itemset on the left-hand side of every as- sociation rule in the representative basis is a frequent key itemset.

Proposition 3 Uniqueness. The representative basis of D wrt minsup and mincon f is unique.

Definition 2 LD System. Let I ,  J ,  K be itemsets. The LD- System consists of the inference rules:  ( 1 )  Weak Left-Augmentation ( w h ) :  I f I  + J K  is inter- esting, then infer that I J  + J K  is interesting.

(2)  Decomposition: I f  I -+ I1 I2 is interesting then infer that I -+ I1 and I -+ I2 are interesting.

Let I- denotes the inference using the LD system. We have 0 -+ AC k C -+ AC,A -+ AC (wLa). C + AC,A -+ AC k C -+ A , A  -+ C (Decomposition). Sim- ilarly, we can infer all other interesting rules, approximate or exact, using the LD system on the representative basis.

Proposition 4 Soundness. Given a set of interesting asso- ciation rules A, all association rules derived from A using the LD system are interesting.

Proposition 5 Completeness. All interesting association rules extracted from a dataset V wrt minsup and mincon f can be derived from the representative basis of V wrt rninsup and mincon f ,  using the LD system.

Proposition 6 Minimality. Let M be the representative basis of a dataset V, wrt minsup and mincon f .  Then for  any association rule T E M ,  T cannot be derived from M \ { r }  using the LD system.
