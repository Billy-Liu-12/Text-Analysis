Research of Mining Algorithm based on  1NF Strongly  Correlated Item Pair

Abstract - In order to reduce the computation cost of candidate pairs, we have developed the Taper algorithm according to 1NF property. The developed TaperR algorithm can cut the number of candidate pairs to improve efficiency.

Experimental results exhibit that the new algorithm is well- worked in the mining of all-strong-pairs. So it is more suitable for real relation database system.

I. INTRODUCTION Association rules in data mining is hot issue. At present, the  framework of mining association rules is based on support, so that will not only lead to a real correlation between the data (Correlation) failed to be found, and in the resulting rules are also many do not have real relevance, it is an inescapable fact.

Therefore, in order to make up for lack of association rules, more and more researchers have begun using statistical correlation methods. In recent years, people are strongly related to projects (in the transaction database with statistical significance) of the excavation to give a certain attention.

Strong problem of mining-related projects should be relevant in a given minimum threshold and be the premise of mining transaction databases, to identify all meet the Pearson's correlation coefficients of not less than the project right.

Xiong et al [1] proposed the Taper algorithm can effectively meet the conditions of strong mining-related projects right. Pearson correlation coefficient based on the technology sector, pruning is the key of the algorithm. From the literature [2] The analysis and test results can be seen, Taper pruning algorithm used to filter out a large number of candidate item pairs. However, if the number of projects and transactions are very large, then even after the reduction still need to test very high computational cost of projects that the remaining candidates, extreme cases, lead to memory is not enough, the algorithm can not run properly completed.

Since a large number of business data is stored in a relational database, while most of the data mining applications are for a relational database, so strong in the relational database research project related to mining, its theoretical value and practical significance are very significant. This paper studies the strong relational database on the problem of mining-related projects, Pearson correlation coefficient for the relevant  measure, with a statistical correlation instead of the traditional association rules, and then design efficient mining algorithms [3].



II. PEARSON CORRELATION COEFFICIENT AND TAPER ALGORITHM  From view of statistical point, the strength of association between variables can be used to describe the correlation measure. For discrete variables, the Pearson correlation coefficient indicated a relationship between variables. Pearson correlation coefficient is the correlation coefficient of binary variable in a special form[4-6].

Suppose that two binary variables A and B, the distribution of their values shown in Table 1.

Tab.1 The distributing figure of variables?value B  0 1 Line sum  0 P(00) P(01) P(0+) A 1 P(10) P(11) P(1+)  Column sum P(+0) P(+1) N Then, correlation coefficient is calculated as:  )1()0()1()0(  )10()01()11()00(  *** **  ????  ? ?  PPPP PPPP  ?  Among them, that )(ijP meet the A == i & & B == j  conditions the number of objects (i = 0,1; j = 0,1). In addition,  )( ?iP meet the A == i said the number of objects (regardless  of the values of B), that satisfy B == j the number of objects (regardless of the values of A). So, the relationship between  )( ?iP ,  )( jP ? and  )(ijP can be expressed as follows:  ? ?  ? ?  )()(  j iji PP  and ?  ? ? ?   )()(  i ijj PP  N is the total number of all objects, that is  )1()0()1()0( ???? ???? PPPPN .

PPPP PPPP  ?  )1()0()1()0(  )10()01()11()11()10()01(  *** **)(  ????  ???? ?  PPPP PPPPPPN  )1()0()1()0(  )11()01()10()11()11(  *** )(*)(*  ????  ??? ?

So, if you use the degree of support for mining association rules of representation, then the item (set) A, B and AB, respectively, the degree of support can sup (A), sup (B) and  sup (A, B) to indicate, then N  P A )1()sup( ??  ,  N P  B )1()sup( ?? , N  P BA )11(),sup( ? . Re-use  N P  A )1()sup( ??  formula to substite, end up, for the  transaction database, A and B on the two projects, with the coefficient can be calculated form the formula (1), said:  ))sup(1(*))sup(1(*)sup(*)sup( )sup(*)sup(),sup(  BABA BABA ??  ? ??      (1)  Which, sup (A), sup (B) and sup (A, B) denote the item (set) A, B and AB of support.

In addition, the set {A, B} is a given project, sup (A) is the A of the support, sup (B) is B's support, we may assume that sup (B) <= sup (A). Also, because sup (B)> = sup (A, B), therefore, according to the formula (1), the project of {A, B} of the correlation coefficient can be the upper bound of the following formula[7]:  ))sup(1(*))sup(1(*)sup(*)sup( )sup(*)sup()sup()( ),( BABA  BABupper BA ?? ?  ??  The above equation can be further pushed and simplification:  ))sup(1(*))sup(1(*)sup(*)sup( ))sup(1(*)sup(  BABA AB  ?? ?  ?  )sup(1 )sup(1*  )sup( )sup(  B A  A B  ? ?  ?  Therefore, the upper bound )( ),( BAupper ?  of the correlation  coefficient ? of  the project {A, B}  can finally be expressed as  equation (2)  )sup(1 )sup(1*  )sup( )sup()( ),( B  A A Bupper BA ?  ? ??           (2)  By the formula (2) and the process, the upper bound )( ),( BAupper ? of the correlation coefficient ? of  the project  {A, B}  is only with A, B related to their support; other words, the calculation of {A, B} of the correlation coefficient ?  does not need to know the upper bound of the project on the {A, B} of the support. Therefore, in the Taper algorithm, that can not meet the conditions of the project can use this upper bound to filter, which has been pruned out of the project no longer need to calculate the degree of support, the efficiency of the algorithm can be improved.



III. NORMALIZATION THEORY ON RELATION DATABASE Relational database is one of the common database  structure. Relational database normalization theory in 1971, first proposed by Dr. EFCodd. Since then, the theory can be continuously deepened and improved. Normalized relational schema design theory as the theoretical guide and a powerful tool, but also other data model database based on the logical design theory, and in the relational database for data mining provides a useful constraint information.

Let relational schema R, X, Y, if r?Ins (R), and any two tuples u, vr, by u [X] = v [X] introduced u [Y] = v [Y], called XY is a function dependent on R, say X or Y function depends on the X function to determine Y.

Different types of paradigms can be used to define the concept of functional dependency, including 2NF, 3NF and BCNF. As we all know, the first paradigm is that each relationship must meet the most important paradigm. It is defined as:  If a domain unit is indivisible unit, then the field is atomic.

A relational schema R if all the attributes of the domain are atomic, we call the relational schema R is the first paradigm (1NF).

In association mining, the first important application of a paradigm is: a project of the two projects can not be from the same property. Thus, we can use this property to reduce the mining process the number of candidate projects, the efficiency of the algorithm can be improved.



IV. MINING ALGORITHM BASED ON THE STRONG CORRELATION 1NF -TAPERR ALGORITHM  To further reduce the relational database project on the candidate's test cost, we use the nature of 1NF improved Taper algorithm, designed to improve the TaperR algorithms, data mining process to reduce the number of candidate projects, to increase the efficiency of the algorithm [4] .

First, we introduce the subsequent chapters will use the symbols and concepts.

Let A1, ..., Am are, respectively, the domain D1, ..., Dm on the property. Order data set D = {X1, X2, ..., Xn} is a collection of tuples. Attribute Ai of the set of attribute values expressed by Vi, the property values of Ai on the number of different attribute ip  is used, ie || ii Vp ? . Require special attention, where the definition data set D and the traditional relationship between the tables are equivalent. The general meaning has been more clearly, we are no longer given special emphasis and distinction.

TaperR algorithm is composed of two steps: candidate generation and pruning project. In the production process of the candidate projects, the use of the nature of 1NF project to reduce the number of candidates; in the pruning process, using the upper bound to filter out those who can not meet the conditions of the project, so that pruning out of the project's support the calculation of avoided costs.

First, according to Theorem 4 Theorem to 1 and a series of theorems, starting with the advantages of the algorithm is proved theoretically TaperR.

Theorem 1: Algorithm for pruning the original Taper  produce a candidate  )1(*)(  ??? ??  m  i i  m  i i pp  before the  process of the project right.

Proof: In a relational table, a total ? ?  m  i ip   items, Taper  algorithm produces candidate operation by linking the project right.

By Theorem 1 we can see, the original Taper algorithm will not take into account the special nature of relations between tables, it generates all possible combinations.

Theorem 2: Before pruning, TaperR algorithm generates a candidate item pairs  ))  )1(* (   )1(*)( (   11 ? ??  ?  ?? ?? ? m  i  ii  m  i i  m  i i pp  pp .

Proof: Since there is a project  ? ?  ?m  i  ii pp  )  )1(* (  that  does not meet the 1NF, so TaperR algorithm does not produce these items right. Therefore, TaperR pruning algorithm  produced only candidate before the  project ))  )1(* (   )1(*)( (   11 ? ??  ?  ?? ?? ? m  i  ii  m  i i  m  i i pp  pp .

By Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 shows that, in the generation of candidate projects on this step, TaperR algorithm to produce  ? ?  ?m  i  ii pp  )  )1(* (  less than the Taper algorithm had a  project, they are not in a relational database on the right.

Number of projects to reduce the size of Ai by the property attribute values on the number ip  of different decisions. If the relational data table contains a lot of property and the number of attribute values are more than the Taper algorithm then TaperR algorithm with more obvious advantages.

In addition, the relational database is not the correct item on the correlation coefficient may not be able to use ?  the upper bound pruning process is cut off, therefore, computational cost increase. In other words, the original Taper Algorithm in the process of pruning algorithm than TaperR need to see more projects, such as the theorems 3.

Theorem 3: Let Taper algorithm and TaperR algorithm is not cut out of the number of projects (related to a given minimum threshold ? ) and, respectively, ?1R and  ?2R  the representative ? ?  ?m  i  ii pp  )  )1(* (  of a relational  database that is not the correct item has not been lost on the the number of projects on, there.

Proof: Let Taper algorithm and TaperR algorithm before pruning process of the project that were used for the collection and said that according to Theorem 1 and 2, there is a relational database and the project is not set correctly. Thus, R1 () = R2 () + R3 () was established proof of the theorem.

Theorem 3 shows that, Taper algorithm not only in the process of pruning redundant checks a project must also scan the database more checks in the items right. Therefore, 1NF nature of the algorithm makes TaperR pruning and scan the database in two steps in both the lower computational cost, which for large data sets, data mining is particularly important.

Pruning algorithm for TaperR upper bound operation, those who can not meet the conditions of the project on this upper bound can be filtered out of the project to avoid pruning the support of the calculation of cost efficiency of the algorithm can be improved. However, this upper bound is always greater than 0, it is easy to see from the formula. So, if the minimum threshold value related to very small, such as 0.01, then by pruning out the number of candidate projects will be very small, so the upper bound on the effect of pruning techniques will become very poor.

Therefore, for this problem, through the use of the special structure of relational tables, we further reduce the number of candidate projects. The basic idea is described below.

May wish to set Vi = {u1, u2, ..., up} and Vj = {v1, v2, ..., vq} attributes Ai and Aj are the property of values. These two properties can generate p * q project right. However, this p * q is not a project are necessary, because sup (uk) = sup (uk v1) +     sup (uk v2) + ... + sup (uk vq).  sup?Or, sup (uk vq) = sup (uk) sup (uk vq-1).? ... ? sup (uk v2) ?(uk v1)  In other words, can sup (uk), sup (uk v1), sup (uk v2), ..., sup (uk vq-1) export support sup (uk vq). Furthermore, the project contains vq of support without the need for scanning the database directly in the process of calculation. Therefore, in scanning the  1) project? 1) * (q ?database, just calculate (p  right.

Optimization effect of the technology is given by Theorem 4.

Theorem 4: In TaperR algorithm, assuming that does not use pruning techniques, then scan the database for the process, we need to check the items up on the support.

Proof: For each property's attributes Ai and Aj, the use of this technology, = degree of support for a project do not have to scan the database in the process of inspection. Consider all the attributes, a total project right. According to Theorem 3-2, TaperR algorithm to generate a project before the cut right.

Therefore, the maximum degree of support items required for the database in the process of scanning checks.

Theorem00204 shows that, even in technology-based pruning effect on the community is not an ideal situation, the new algorithm can still effectively reduce the number of projects. That is, even in the smallest little relevance threshold when, TaperR algorithm can still be effective on the excavation project[8].

In summary, TaperR algorithm described in Figure 2.1, the overall process can be used. Algorithm contains three steps: 1) generate candidate projects; 2) pruning of candidate projects; 3) Scan the database to get the final result.



V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS We use TaperR algorithm to test on real data sets and  related results are given in the algorithm execution time and number of projects on the two dimensions compared with the original Taper algorithm. The two data sets from the experimental point of view the experimental results prove the validity and superiority.

Taper mentioned in this section are algorithms and TaperR through Java programming. Experiment operating environment are a Pentium4-2.4G, 512 M RAM running Windows 2000 Professional PC.

A. Experimental Data Sets In the experiment, two data sets used in this article:  Mushrooms (Mushroom) data set and soybean (Soybean) data sets, are from the well-known UCI database (Http:// www.ics.uci.edu/ ~ mlearn / MLRRepository . html), following a brief overview of the two data sets.

soybean (Soybean) data set: In	 this data set, each record is a sample of soybeans, 35 feature attributes; the same time each record has a class label, marked as 4 in one disease, namely: Diaporthe Stem Canker, Charcoal Rot, Rhizoctonia Root Rot, and Phytophthora Rot. This data set 47 records, including records of Phytophthora Rot, 17, and the remaining 10 diseases have a record of each.

mushrooms (Mushroom) data set:	 In this data set, each record is a sample of mushrooms, there are 22 characteristics of properties, including color, shape, skin, etc.; the same time each record has a class label, that is toxic mushrooms is non-  toxic. This data set a total of 8124 records, the number of toxic and non-toxic mushrooms 4208 and 3916, respectively.

B. Experimental Results First, we observe the algorithm associated with the  minimum threshold for a given increase in the project need to check the number of changes.

Figure 1 and Figure 2 are given in the mushrooms (Mushroom) data set and soybean (Soybean) data sets, Taper algorithm and TaperR algorithm associated with the minimum threshold for a given increase in the project need to check the number of comparison. Consistent with previous theoretical proof, Taper algorithm always need to check the project for more than TaperR algorithm. Therefore, the superiority of this algorithm is proved by the experiment.

Figure.1 Comparison of the number of items desired to be checked in Mushroom dataset  Figure. 2 Comparison of the number of items desired to be checked in Soybean dataset  These results show that the algorithm designed TaperR relational database on the strong correlation of the excavation project, showing good results, more suitable for practical application of relational database systems.



VI. CONCLUSION Since a large number of business data stored in relational  databases, and most of the data mining is also against the relational database, so strong in the relational database on the project of mining-related research, its theoretical value and practical significance are very significant. This paper studies the strong relational database on the problem of mining-related projects, Pearson correlation coefficient for the relevant measure, with a statistical correlation instead of the traditional association rules, and then design an efficient mining algorithm.

Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed algorithm in a relational database TaperR be strong on the mining-related projects on time, showing good results,     and various aspects are better than existing similar Taper algorithm.
