Abstract  It has been shown that literal information can enhance geolocation information in the multi-target tracking and data association problem. Thi's paper continues previous efforts in establishing a sys- tematic approach to the combination of both types of information using membership functions based upon multiple-valued logic. Filters are established for literal and non-numerical attributes, somewhat analogous to the well-known Kalman filter. The major result, however, is an improvement and clari- fication of a previous theorem establishimg asymp- totic forms for the posterior possibility distribu- tion of the unknown data association parameter as information granularity decreases and as inference rule structures become more definitive.

1. Introduction  The multi-target tracking and data association (or as comnnly called, "correlation") problem still remains the center of much activity and interest. In the past, emphasis was placed upon the use of only geolocation data-i.e., information containing reports on (usually) two- or three- dimensional target positions, together with possi- ble velocities, accelerations and related equations of motion parameters [1-31. More recently, an ef- fort has been carried out in utilizing in a more rigorous or systematic manner other types of infom ation , including various sorts of sensor systen parameters that could also be formally treated in terms of equations of motion. In addition, use of attribute information of radically different natures is also sought. This includes visual sight- ings, classifications, and other,often non-numerical and linguistic-based (or narrative),information which cannot be treated from traditional statistical analysis. This work is presented in [4-6], based upon, and related to,in general, previous and on- going researc?i in possibility and fuzzy set theory and its realtionships to classical probability theory and multi-valued logic and set theory [7-9).

In this paper we continue to attempt to estab- lish a unified approach to the integration of both types of Information for the multi-target tracking and data association problem. However, since the results are carried out on a general level, with suitable modifications, applications to medical diagnosis, fault determination, and other problems involving non-sequential knowledge-based systems can be established [9].

As stated before, this work still unfortunate- ly requires both a sense of "art" as well as sci- ence in achieving its goal.

2. Basic Problem  The basic problem can be stated as follows: Observed or reported data arrives,usually in-  dexed by time t , attribute typo k, and sensor source u. For pWrposes of simplicity, we will omit the last index and assume the multiple sensor source problem is resolved and plays no role in the analysis here. Attributes A, k=l,2,..,M", can be either objective or statisdcal in nature or they can be subjective or linguistic in nature. Denoting the natural domain of values (which can be numbers, vectors of nunbers, lin2uistic labels, etc.) of each attribute A as Dk- dom(A ), statistical att- ributes typical19 have their dhmains D CRRnk with error distributions in the form of cldas ical prob- ability functions, typically being discretized versions of Gaussian or mixtures of Gaussian dis- tributions. Thus, in general, unless representing dirac or mass-point distributions, the error prrob- ability functions are not normable,i.e., they have maximal values less than unity (due to the obvious constraint of probabilities adding up to one). On the other hand, subjective attributes Ak typically have D being some finite set of labels with no naturat spacial ordering present, unless D repre- sents a set of n -tuples of measurement quintities, where for examplbT,A7= "large" could have D7 con- sisting of pairs (a,b), with a being weight in lbs and b length in meters. The error distributions corresponding to subjective attributes are often in the form of normable possibility functions-but not probability functions-obtained from a panel of experts, in contrast to the geoblation-physical derivation of statistical attribute error distri- butions. For motivation for such subJective distri- butions, representing overlapping and/or vague compound events - in contradistinction to statisti- cal distributions representing disjoint exhaustive events- see again [4]. Each error distribution represents the conditional possibility (possibili- ties include probabili-ties as special cases) that a particular attribute domain value is actually present, given an observed/reported domain value.

Whether statistical or subjective, it is assused that at least theoretically each such distribution is obtainable.

In addition to error distributions and observ- ed data, a collection of inference rules is assumed to be present. Each such rule R consists of an antecedent part ant and a condquent part conseqv connected by an impYication operation. ant con- sists of the conjunction (more generally, s&me com- bination of conjunctions, disjunctions, and/or ne- gations ) only of modified matching tables for each attribute from some subset of all the attri- butes. Each modification modv k of basic matching table M for is assumed ' to be in the form of an ihtens ifcation or strengthening or an exten- sification or weakening. More generally,modifica- tions can involve positive and/or negative forms.

For simplicity, we asstue throughout here that only positive forms are present.(See [10) for more background on modifiers and hedges for attributes.) In ordinary English, intensifications can be rep- resented in a simple order as e.g. ... 'slightly very",.. ,"very",.. .,"very,very",. . ,"extresely" ...

Extensifications can be expressed as e.g. . .."very very little oft,..,"very little of",..,"more or less of",..,"moderate amount of",.. The conse- quence consists of a single modification modv (again, either a positive intensification or ex- tensification) of the basic data association level.

Then, as data arrives, track histories are built up (wlth some eventually discarded) sequent- ially in time, consisting of those data reports which are adjudged as belonging to the same target source. The decision on associatinq together or not a given pair - a previously established or tentative track history with a new report- is based upon the application of the set of inference rules and error distributions upon the two data vectors, where it is understood that the previously established track history i is suitably updated for comparisons with the new report J. Of course, for a given track history the updating of the data history for a statistical attribute, under linear- Markov or Gaussian assumptions,can be made using the now well-established Kalman filter [11). On the other hand, the very different struetured subject- ive attributes require another approach. For ex- ample, A might be "color of flag" with D = {red, red-ora4n3,orange,..., blue,...,black str4 ed, .}, or A might be "class" with D - { C C ,.

How 21 we "filter"or predict aLong sub, {iJes?

Thus an attribute filter is sought for these cases.

But after a moment's thought, the answer to this problem is relatively simple: obtain the possibil- ity analogues for the probability function situa- tion. This is spelled out in section 4.

Hence a reasonable measure of cen- tral tendency for e so described is , using formal- ly expectation notation  E(el diag,2J)=;R,P)t S0.d*(ldiag,Z(I ;R,P)  (See also [6] for further discussion) (  A simplified outline of a data association procedure utril zng the PACTalngorthm as describ- ed above is given in Figure 1i  Figure 1. Flow Chart for Data Association From One Data Sampling Time to the Next  5. Some Asymptotic Results  Given the above scheme for obtaining the final posterior possibility function for the level of data association between two track histories, the following natural question arises: Can some analogue with the classical case of statistical consistency be established here? In [6] it was shown that as the fineness of the domains of statistical attri- butes increased- and dually, the granularity de- creased- under certain reasonable conditions,the posterior function for data association converged to a computable function of a statistical expecta- tion. In turn, the behavior of this limiting ex- pression as inference rules and error distributions became more precise was considered, leading to, under perhaps too stringent conditions, a form of consistency. In order to clarify this further, a similar result, under weakened conditions and with     more specific applications, will be presented.

An important famnily of t-norms and t-conorms is due to Frank [13). (See also [12).) These satis- fy the basic modular relation  *or(x,y) = x + y - *&(x.y) , (22) for all x,y ? [0,1]. Frank has shown that this family can be characterized by the Archimedean class - i.e., all *&* *or such that for all x c (0,1),  (23)*&(x,x)<x and or(x,x)>x s which i's also DeMorgan, i.e.

Indeed, the Archimedean class of Frank contains many common t-norms and t-conorms and can be con- veniently parameterized, using parameter s :  s(x b b Xq log'(lt$+ (SX-l)4s-l )q-k) with or(xl..xq) determined from the DeNorgaA25) or modular relations, for all x 1.,uxq e [0,1) , with generator function hs given as  h (x) = - ogtsXl)(s-l)); x ?

It follows that if all t-norms and t-conorms used in the computations for the posterior function of e are culled from Frank's family and the assump- tions (a)j,b),(f) hold, then Theorem 2 is valid, and the key computations for K and v are  For generator h5, of or' si'  Cd hs (x)/dx)x.1 - _ 0<s'<c+Ws'#I)  CI(s'=l ) , (30)For *&,sI, (sX-l)/(s-l) (a *^,(X.Y)/y)y=0 = (O<S<ce,sOl)  (s=l ) * (31) For =&Ps O&MS1 '  (o0 s')/c,2s-l))2M'-l K - O<s 1<4,n ((lg1  (s'-l) % (32)  Finally, let us consider briefly the effect of the choice of inference rules and the accuracy of the error distributions upon the asymptotic posterior function for e as given in Theorem 2.

So far, iatching tables have not been discussed.

In general, although the basic strutures of the inference rules do not depend upon time and the  particular pair of track histories in question, the matching table does. For subjective attributes, these could be chosen as some type of symmtrlza- tion of the corresponding error distributions, while for statistical attributes, the matching tables can be naturally chosen as  M (i'J) = I-F cxcz(iJ)n (33) where k,m nk k ,m '(34)  k,m k,m k,m km km k,, k,m and Fn is the probability di;tribution functionnk of x corresponding to the Z(t) being r.v.'s with a connon expectation, bqt oflerwise described by independent p.d.f.'s f ,kt) as for V in Theorem 2.
