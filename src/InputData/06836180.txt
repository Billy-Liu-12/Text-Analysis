A Cooperative Radio Resource Management Strategy for Mobile Multimedia LTE Uplink

Abstract?LTE and LTE-A have promised to provide high data rates to the end users with innovative radio techniques that are not only power efficient but also spectral efficient. One such technique is Single Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA), which is employed by the LTE uplink. SC- FDMA can provide power efficiency to battery-limited devices due to lower PAPR compared to OFDMA. An open issue in SC-FDMA is related to the implementation of efficient radio resource management (RRM) techniques able to provide enough radio resources to comply with user requirements in mobile environments characterized by time-varying channel conditions.

Obtaining accurate channel state information (CSI) under these conditions is often quite impracticable. In this paper, we are proposing a cooperative radio resource management (RRM) algorithm inspired by Game Theory for localized-SC-FDMA systems in the presence of terminal mobility and imperfect channel estimation. Our approach is based on the maximization of minimum required Quality-of-Experience (QoE), expressed by means of suitable Mean-Opinion-Score (MOS) metrics. Pre- liminary simulation results can prove that the time varying char- acteristics of the channels can be counteracted in a better way if negotiations among users are enabled. We further show that such negotiations can maximize the QoE of user populations, compared to other state of the art strategies, particularly in the case of higher mobility channels.
