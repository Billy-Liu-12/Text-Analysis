This research aims the understanding of the spread of IT Governance models and quality instruments in this context and the occurrence of several IT problems in the analyzed organizations. The main contribution is the identification of the respondent?s perception about the relationship between the IT Governance models and quality instruments adoption and their impact on several IT problems throughout statistical analysis of the collected data.

1. Introduction   The organizations, especially government, have been demanding from software providers that they prove high quality software development. This has motivated the creation of several IT Governance models, software process quality models, methodologies, practices and techniques. Software companies are investing effort on IT Governance models adoption and software processes improvement (SPI) and quality management initiatives to achieve the quality demanded by software consumers. It creates a new kind of relationship among these initiatives, the organizations and the usual Information Technology (IT) problems.

In order to explore and understand this relationship, a quantitative research was conducted among 260 participants of a software quality event in Brazil. This paper presents the preliminary results of this research.

It was carried out statistical analysis in the collected data aiming to understand the level of spread of each quality instrument and the impact of their adoption in a set of usual IT problems.

This paper is organized in six sections. This introduction is the section 1 and it is followed by the literature review in the section 2. The section 3 presents the research method. The section 4 presents the data analysis. The section 5 presents some discussion on the findings and the section 6 presents our conclusions.

2. Literature   Since the shift from the industrial age to the age of the information, the adoption and utilization of IT becomes expressive. However, as IT evolves, the complexity of IT environment evolves as well. Also, it turns necessary to improve the IT management in order to reduce costs, increase control of the IT and improve the alignment between IT and business goals.

This way, organizations around the world are looking for methodologies, practices and techniques to enable the management of IT. This paper analyzes some of these methodologies, practices and techniques.

In this paper, we named them generically as quality instruments.

The organizations need gradual cultural change in order to turns the strategic alignment effective.

According to Freedman [1] and Digman [2], the organizational culture is composed of behavior, values, goals and ideological inheritance. Successful organizations must be able to integrate IT and strategies, culture and organizational ethics, to remain in compliance with business goals [3].

According to the ITSMF-International, the process of providing a service is a combination of production and usage, where client and supplier interact [4]. The ITIL has been pointed by both academy and industry as a good way to manage IT services. The ITIL service management presents best practices that organizations can use in different ways independently of their size or business area [5].

The ISO 9000 standards were created to deal with quality management. In these standards the quality is understood as all product or service characteristics  ______________________________________________________ Study developed by the Research Group of the PDTI 01/2008, financed by Dell Computers of Brazil Ltd. with resources of Law 8.248/91.

required by the consumer, and the quality management as the way to assure the compliance to consumer requirements [7].

The PNQ (a Portuguese acronym to National Quality Prize) was developed and it is maintained by the Brazilian National Quality Foundation, a Brazilian foundation oriented to research and share knowledge about management excellence. The PNQ is based on excellence criteria that constitute a systemic approach of management adopted by several organizations of world class [8].

CMMI was created to help organizations on their process area capability and maturity assessments, and on establishing and implementing the improvements prioritization [9][30]. CMMI is different than other CMM models as it allows its implementation either in only one process or organization area or in all organization areas. Those implementations are known as staged and continuous.

IT Governance Institute has designed and created the COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and related Technology). As stated in [10], IT governance is the responsibility of the executives and the board of directors, and consists of the leadership, organizational structure and processes that ensure that the enterprise?s IT sustains and extends organization strategies and objectives.

3. Research method   This work has an exploratory nature, proper to be applied when the goal is evaluate a theme or an investigation problem not widely studied or that has no previous study [11][12]. This research method aims comprehension of the state of art in the situations where the practice comes before the theory [13].

The research strategy adopted was the survey, which looks for characteristics for a specific population or phenomenon, and establishes the relationship among variables [14], giving to the researcher information about situations, facts, opinions or behaviors found in the evaluated population [13].

The survey utilized primary data, i.e. data obtained specially to attend the research needs. The unit of analysis is the respondent. The data was collected by applying a form that was filled out by the respondents.
