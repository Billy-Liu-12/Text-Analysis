IIPP and CIT based Intelligent Autonomous QA System

Abstract   This paper proposes an architecture of autonomous Question Answering system, which is based on Intelligent Information push-pull (IIPP) technology, Comprehensive Information (CI) Theory and Intelligent Autonomous Decentralized Systems (IADS).

In this system, topic-based Association Rules Mining is applied for finding all association rules and a new criterion, IIPP for acquiring the required knowledge from large information source. The effectiveness of this system is demonstrated in the rural information system, which has not only Autonomous controllability and coordinability, but also some Activity, Mobility, Sensibility, Reactivity and Sociality.

1. Introduction   The boom in the use of the Web and its exponential growth are now well known. Just the amount of textual data available is estimated to be in the order of one tear byte. In addition, other media, such as images, audio, and video are also available. Thus the Web can be seen as a very large, unstructured, heterogeneous but ubiquitous database, which triggers the need for efficient tools to retrieve and filter information from this database. The general search engines are such tools, but could not satisfy the users? information needs, since the user?s interests were represented only in keywords but the contents of the presented information were a list of Web pages. Without the support of a powerful tool for analyzing the huge raw data, finding the user-needed information sometimes resembles looking for a needle in a bottle of hay.

To help users in this task of finding their needed information, Question Answering (QA) systems, whose main task is providing a short answer to a natural- query, were proposed. However, the current  QA systems don?t necessarily match the user?s individual interests and knowledge.

Intelligent Information Push-Pull (IIPP) Technology just is developed to solve the problems above. ?Push? and ?Pull? have their own merit and shortcoming, and they should learn each other.

Combined with artificial intelligence, knowledge engineering, database and Internet, ?Push? and ?Pull? can help the user overcome the ?information overload?.

Comprehensive Information Theory (CIT) is a new way of describing knowledge, which makes use of syntactic information, semantic information and pragmatic information of data attributes. We present IIPP and CIT based Intelligent Autonomous QA System (IAQA), which can provide services to users under heterogeneous requirement levels and changing situation of users and providers.

2. The Architecture of autonomous Question Answering system   Much of the classical research and development in QA system has occurred in context of centralized systems. These systems postulate a service provider who is in effect a ?service czar? having complete control over the service aspects of the system.

However, it is generally agreed that implementing and maintaining the service systems is difficult.

As the breakthrough over the conventional systems, Intelligent Autonomous Decentralized System (IADS) have been proposed by Prof. Tu Xuyan and their technologies have been developed [1]. In IADS we must go beyond the traditional view to consider systems which have multiple autonomous points of control service. IADS is composed of Autonomous Decentralized Systems (ADS) and Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI), Large Systems Cybernetics (LSC) and Intelligent Management Systems (IMS). Three Architectures of IADS based on     Agent are given: Union-IADS, Market- IADS and Group- IADS.

IADS has three design methods and two implementation techniques. Three methods are ?Agent-Oriented?(A/O) method, ?Generalized Modeling Method?(GMM) and ?Intelligent Optimization Method?(ZOM), while two techniques are ?Multi-Bases Cooperation?(MBC) and ?Intelligent Information push-pull?(IIPP) for IADS.

IADS based on Multi-Agent Systems (MuAS) and Mobile Agent Systems (MoAS) has not only Autonomous Controllability and Autonomous Coordinatility, but also some anthropopathic Distributed Artificial Intelligence(DAI) such as: Activity, Mobility, Sensibility, Reactivity and Sociality.

A general architecture of Intelligent Autonomous QA System is shown in Fig 1.

3. The technique of autonomous Question Answering system   ?Push? and ?Pull? are popular methods in question answering system. Pushing information is when users say, "I need to know this information immediately when it happens." Push is a new model for delivering information over the web. Push simply means that new information is retrieved and delivered automatically from a remote computer to the user?s PC.  It is helpful to the user mining the valuable information efficiently.

Pulling information is when users say, "I want to have access to this information when I decide to go get it." The "puller" just needs to know where it is stored and uses the Web to send a query and gets the needed information.

To improve the efficiency of acquiring the useful information from the Internet and database, enlarge the capability of the Internet and database offering the active and personalized information service, we combine the artificial intelligence with knowledge engineering and database to develop a technology of IIPP-Intelligent Information push-pull[3] ( see Fig.2).

Intelligent information  push-pull  information pushing, information pulling  machine learning, knownledge discovering  artificial intelligence,  knowledge engineering Internet, database  Fig.2 the Framework of the IIPP  3.1. IPushAgent   Through the association rules, standard technique and user model, Intelligent Information Push is an automatic mechanism for getting information that statifies the users? perspective from the web, and regularly transferring the information by Web page or email to the user. The structure of the IPushAgent is:  IPush Agent { MAgent     //Management Agent DFAgent    //Directory Facilitator Agent WCAgent    // Web Crawling Agent ARMAgent  //Association Rules Mining  Agent IRAgent      // Information Retrieval Agent IPAgent      //Information Push Agent RM         //Resource Management &  Task Coordination MTS         //Message Transport System }  IPush Agent can automatically search the topic information that users concern and transfer it to the users at the time and spot the user preference after selection, classification and ranking, according to the user?s request including the user?s personal archives, information topic and research direction, etc.

Intelligent Information Push Technology realizes the professional and intelligent network topic information     service in the Internet/Intranet environment, and it will become the technology base of personalized knowledge service in the future. Intelligent Information Push Technology switches the search mode from ?people search information? to ?information search people?, sends information to people by email, channels pushing and Web ordering.

3.2. IPullAgent   Intelligent Information Pull is a multi-agent system.

IPull Agent decomposes the user?s query task, generates query term, then searches the user-concerned information efficiently, accurately and feedback it to the user.

The structure of IPull Agent is: IPull Agent {  MAgent     //Management Agent DFAgent     //Directory Facilitator Agent PGAgent    // Question Parsing Agent REAgent    //Result Extraction Agent IRAgent     // Information Retrieval Agent IPAgent     //reasoning Agent RM        //Resource Management &  Task Coordination MTS      //Message Transport System }  IPull Agent provides the direct answers to user questions by consulting its knowledge base. Combined with information retrieval (IR) and NLP techniques, IPull Agent has the potential to answer questions of a wide variety of topics from huge documents collection (e.g., the web itself),.

IPull Agent lies on the top of documents collection and handles retrieval requests. In the context of web, this is a search engine that indexes web pages, analyzes these documents and extracts answers from them.

3.3. IIPPAgent   The IAQA system is an information service system  that recommends the selected information by user?s interest, concern and preference. It requires the system be able to track the user?s daily browsing and the searching, deduce the information user need and recommend the new information.

Association rules identify collections of data attributes that are statistically related in the underlying data [6]. An association rule is of the form X => Y where X and Y are disjoint conjunctions of attribute- value pairs. The confidence of the rule is the conditional probability of Y given X, Pr(Y|X), and the  support of the rule is the prior probability of X and Y, Pr(X and Y). Here probability is taken to be the observed frequency in the data set. The traditional association rule mining problem can be described as follows. Given a database of transactions, a minimal confidence threshold and a minimal support threshold, find all association rules whose confidence and support are above the corresponding thresholds.

Topic-based Association Rules Mining will apply the CIT for finding all association rules and a new criterion, which makes use of syntactic information, semantic information and pragmatic information of data attributes.

The Comprehensive Information provided by an object and perceived by a subject is defined as a trinity ? the form, the meaning, and the value all related to the object?s states and the manner of the states varying. So, CI is a name for the entirety of syntactic, semantic and pragmatic information of the object concerned (see Fig.3).

Fig.3 Model of comprehensive information   As we can see from Fig.3, the states of objects can be represented by sequence of symbols. Relation among them can demonstrate the manner of states varying, so they are the formalized syntactic information of objects. When symbols are used to refer to realistic object, the syntactic information is endowed with true meaning, which is semantic information. And when these two kinds of information are related with specific human users (subjects), they will exhibit certain value, or utility, to the user?s goal, which is pragmatic information.

The characteristic of CIT makes it especially fit for our IAQA system, since in the case of personalized recommendation syntactic information concerns if a user utterance can be parsed. Semantic information concerns if the utterance?s meaning is true in logic.

Pragmatic information describes if the user utterance is related with the previous system utterance.

For any given object { }nxxxX ,,, 21 L= , three kinds of descriptive parameters are introduced, named  Syntactic Information    Meaning                     Value     Semantic                        Pragmatic Information                     Information  Object State /  Symbol Subject     the certainty denoted by { }ncccC ,,, 21 L= , the logical truth denoted by { }ntttT ,,, 21 L= , and the utility denoted by { }nuuuU ,,, 21 L= . CI can thus be described by using a matrix.

4. An Application   The information service system for the rural area  and society development resource is an application of IIPP and CIT based Intelligent Autonomous QA System (see Fig.1), including:  Crawling Agent: discovering, collecting the web pages from the Website automatically with the support of a high performance spider (or robot). A crawler acts like hyper-caffeinated web browsers. Seeded with a set of URLs, it downloads Web pages, then: extracts all links on every page for further Crawling; finally hands the pages off to the indexer.

Filtering Agent: filtering for MBC, index is established from the retrieved Web information, in which inverted files is generally used. An inverted file is a word-oriented mechanism for indexing a text collection.

IPullAgent: The system performs the personalized information retrieval and information push-pull with the users? interests to achieve high-speed, high-precise, personalized information service.

IPushAgent: The popular key-word based retrieval technology retrieves information from the Web according to user keywords and their logic relation, and then returns the relative information to the users. It only concentrates the syntactic information and ignores the semantic information, causing much useless information retrieved. In addition, several keywords are unable to express the user?s query, especially for the low-educated peasants for their query usually is in  some colloquial style. In order to make the computer understand the user?s request and improve the retrieval efficiency, we apply the natural language processing technique into the system.

QA Management Agent: A friendly, simple and easy-using interface is very important to the main users of the system-people in the rural area. The use interface of the system can acquires users input, display retrieval results, provides feedbacks, which take the user favorites into consideration carefully.

5. Conclusion   Based on the combination of IIPP and CIT, the Intelligent Autonomous QA System is proposed and developed, which helps user cope efficiently with the rapidly evolving widespread growth of the Internet. In this paper, IAQA system?s architecture and performance are given. Some methods and techniques for design and implementation of IAQA system are introduced. IAQA system is more effective as the value-addition to the user?s information service system which is built under the open and standard technologies.
