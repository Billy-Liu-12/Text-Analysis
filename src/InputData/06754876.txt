Design and analysis of high speed low power reusable on chip bus based on  wishbone

Abstract? FPGA and ASIC design based on SoC technology have been widely used in the embedded systems. A  flexible interconnection scheme is crucial in SoC design. In this  paper, we adopt the Wishbone bus to interconnect a variety of  devices due to its open architecture and many a free IP core with  a Wishbone interface supplied by Open Cores organization. In  general SoC system, a single bus interconnects all devices that are  not divided into high-performance unit such as CPU,on-chip ram  and low speed devices like uart,gpio and so on. It leads to a big  problem: all Wishbone bus cycles run at the speed of the slowest  device. We have to add the corresponding logic to regulate the  system frequency for some low-speed devices, but it causes a new  problem which increases the overall system power consumption.

In view of the drawback, based on Wishbone bus, the paper  proposes a double bus that makes first level Wishbone bus and  the second level bus to interconnect the different devices  according to the speed of the devices.Finally, we set up a SoC  system to verify the performance of the proposed bus and the  result shows that the double bus is feasible in low-power SoC  design.



I. INTRODUCTION  Wishbone bus Specification is defined as a kind of  common interface within the interconnection of IP  core. So it defines a standard set of signals and bus  cycles to connect different modules, and it can  interconnect between soft-core, solid-core and hard-  core. Furthermore, it has no special required on the  development tools and target hardware and almost  compatible with all existing mainstream EDA  synthesis tool, and you can use a variety of hardware  description language to achieve it. a double bus that  makes first level Wishbone bus and the second level  bus to interconnect the different devices according to  the speed of the devices.Finally,we set up a SoC  system to verify the performance of the proposed bus  and the result shows that the double bus is feasible in  low-power SoC design.



II. PROPOSED STUCUTURE Main implementation of the double  wishbone as shown below where it consists of two  wishbone bus and opb bus inside address decoder,  wishbone bus 2 and wishbone bus 1 is select the signal  based on address decoding .data is input to the opb bus  from data generator, address decoder decode the address  and select the particular wishbone bus for data  transmission to peripheral device. Every peripheral  device is assign with address if the assign address is high  it select the high data transmission wishbone bus  otherwise if lower address it select low data transmission  wishbone bus.

The figure1 below can apply to the  wb_conmax structure  used as double wishbone bus  structure so that it cover the master ?slave interface  through bridge.  In the design,wb_conmax0 directly  adopts the wb_conmax provided by Opencores  organization;wb_conmax1 handle address decoding  on the basis of wb_conmax0;The bus bridge process  the interconnection and synchronization of data and   DOI 10.1109/ICSIP.2014.37    DOI 10.1109/ICSIP.2014.37    DOI 10.1109/ICSIP.2014.37     address signal between wb_conmax0 and  wb_conmax1. The devices interconnect through the  standard wishbone bus signal,unlike the AMBA  which consiste of AHB and APB.So the bus bridge  do not think over the bus signal conversion,just  need to realize the task of address encode and  synchronization within different clock siginal.

Figure 1: Double wishbone bus opb connection  a.  Address coding Wb_conmax1 address encode is independent of  the wb_conmax,and we can simply assign the relative  address0x0000_0000,0x0100_0000,0x0200_0000,0x030  0_000,,0x 0f00_0000.Each slave device have address  space of 16MB that satisfy the requirement of the low-  speed devices in embedded systems. According to figure  3,wb_conmax1 was connected to slave interface 13 of  wb_conmax0,the address of low-speed devices is  0xd000_0000,0xd100_0000,0xd200_000,0xd300_0000,  0x df00_0000. We get address encoding of bus bridge  by decoding of the 24th to 27th of address bus and select signal of first-level bus, as is showed in figure 2.

Figure 2 Master slave inter connection through addres decoder  b. Synchronous logic In the double wishbone bus,we must design  synchronous logic of bus brideg because two level  bus have different frequency.The logic is designed  by response signal waiting mechanism, In the  design,the second-level bus operating frequency is  the even-frequency of the first-level bus frequency,  so the synchronization logic is designed by the  response signal waiting mechanism. The frequency  of hign-speed bus is 4 times or 2 times as often than  low-speed bus in multi-level bus system[6].Taking  into accout the operating frequency of the  peripheral devices in secondary-level bus,ratio of  frequency of two levle bus set up to four times in  the bus bridge.



III.     Simulation  Simulating the written VHDL code in ISE  simulator and verifying the waveforms generated by  the simulator. If the required simulated output is not  achieved, then the VHDL code is checked and  necessary corrections are made. The required  waveforms are noted down as a reference to the     synthesis stage or at the final stage. The waveforms  are presented subsequently.



IV. IMPLEMENTATION  All the VHDL module files are integrated  and a top file is selected to run the whole  implementation.  Implementation compresses of  different stages like translate, map and place and  route (PAR).  A programming file is generated  which creates a bit format file, which is dumped on  the Xilinx or SPARTAN-III using Xilinx (software)  through a Joint Task Acting Group (JTAG)  communication cable.  On the hardware, if the  design works according requirement, then design is  corrected, if any error occurs then reconsider the  design.



V. RESULTS As we can seen from simulation result the chip  select signal low the data ?aabbccdd? trasmit  through higher order wishbone bus and when chip  select signal is high the data is trasmitted through  lower order wishbone bus.

VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK  The paper design a kind of double wishbone bus  based on wb_conmax released by Open Cores  organization. The two different type of IP core link  with the two level bus respectively,the architecture  can not only improve the "Design-reuse" ,it also  provide the optimal strategy for reduction of power  consumption.Finally,the paper set up a SoC system  based on double wishbone bus and get synthesis  report and power analysis report, the result verifys  the feasibility of low-power design by adopting  double bus structure in SoC system. This  implementation design only for 2  periperal device  it can be extended for                         more  devicess.The timing and clock frequence can be  reduced by reducing the number of resource  utilization. Area and power consumption can even  be reduced by reducing number of gate and flip  flop.
