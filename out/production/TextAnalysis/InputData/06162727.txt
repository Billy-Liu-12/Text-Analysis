Abstract?Power distribution incidents collected by the electric utility through their customer service centers and incident management systems are analyzed systematically in this work.

An incident is defined by the actions carried out by the utility to return the system to its normal operation when a failure occurrs.

A sequence of incidents is a set of dated incidents recorded in a region or a network during a period of time, but only some subsets of them are of interest, either because they present similar features or because they are related in a way that allows them to be considered together (timing, periodicity, etc.). These subsets of significant incidents in a sequence are called episodes and are instances of possible patterns that define the behaviour of the system. The analysis is oriented to extract useful information from sequences of historical data to recognize relevant episodes that show a pattern of behaviour which could be useful to forecast future incidents or assist planning and operation. With this goal, the authors evaluate the use of a pattern discovery algorithm in sequences of incidents gathered in a network as part of the case study. Since the incidents can occur by random factors not all the frequent episodes that can be found are relevant. Then, it is proposed a methodology based on set theory to choose the relevant episodes which are especially useful to recognize outstanding episodes in sequences that have high randomness, which is the case of sequences of incidents in electrical networks.

I. INTRODUCTION  The exploitation of information gathered from the networkis one of the challenges posed by the smart grids. The huge number and variety of components in networks (overhead lines, cables, circuit breakers, transformers, fuses, insulators, etc.) that can be affected by failures makes difficult to deploy monitoring strategies that individually supervise all of these elements. Consequently, new paradigms are needed to develop low cost solutions to assist maintenance policies. They should be oriented to extract and exploit useful information from historical data (call centers, event repositories and power quality data bases, control center data bases,etc.) and on-line events generated during both normal and abnormal conditions [1], [2].

Failure of components in power networks cause problems related with power quality and reliability [3]. Factors such as environmental conditions, external agents or component status are involved in the occurrence of faults and failures. While faults are short circuits caused, for example, by dielectric breakdown of the insulation system, the failures are the termi- nation of the ability of the components to perform its required functions [4]. The component failures normally induce faults and these faults are reflected as disturbances in the supply voltage. Utilities usually use the term incident to indicate the existence of such faults or failures and the activity performed by the utlity to restore the normal operation of the system.

Examples of incidents are a failure in a cable by aging and its reparation or the actuation of protective system in the head of a feeder by a lightning followed by a restoration sequence.

Maintenance policies (preventive, based on condition mon- itoring, etc) are implemented to reduce the impact of faults in the network. Also, fault prediction based on the early identification of symptoms, or incipient faults, leading to the appareance of faults is a topic of interest in power systems and several frameworks are available [5], [6], [7], [8], [9].

Moreover, the events generated by those faults can present different shapes depending on many factors such as the phases affected (including number of phases, unbalance...), the load (presence of laterals, affected load, etc.), fault impedance (high/low value, pure resistive or not), type of affected line (aerial, cable or a combination of both), among others. The study of significant features for each type of fault and the episode associated with them is a hot research topic because it offers possible ways to automatically diagnose the cause of the fault or to be used as a prediction tool [10]. However, methods must be developed to improve the systematic analysis of events caused by faults and their propagation along the network in order to discover fault patterns associated with frequent causes and their origin or to maintain accurate fault diagnoses and predictions. Automatic association among event records and incidents reported in the control center are also of great interest to improve knowledge of system performance and to contextualize the occurrence of faults in the system.

This work focuses on the incidents of the power systems that are reported in the control center and collect information from customer service centers and incident management systems.

The aim is to discover useful information from the analysis of sequences of those incident reports. Since not all the incidents are produced by failures and they have different origin and causes, the first step is to recognize frequent and relevant episodes that shows a representative pattern of the incidents and could be used to forecast similar incidents in the future     or to predict the consequences of occurring some typologies of them again.



II. PATTERN DISCOVERY IN SEQUENCES OF EVENTS  Pattern discovery in sequential events has been widely applied in different fields (financial series, alarms in com- munication networks, sequences of queries in databases, se- quences of customer transactions, etc.). The task focuses on the discovery of temporal patterns called episodes that occur often in a sequence. Episode discovery approach was proposed in [11] and it was generalized in [12] adding explicit time constraints and new methods for measuring the frequency of those episodes.

A sequence of events, S, is the set of events, ei, typically collected during a period of time (t1 ? tn):  S = S(t1, tn) = ?e1(t1), e2(t2), . . . en(tn)?  The events in S are sorted according to their time stamp (ti > ti?1, i = 2, 3, . . .n). The length of the sequence S is denoted by |S| = n.

An episode, E, is an ordered collection of events (E = ?ei, ej , . . . ek?) in S (E ? S) that occur together following an order relation (partial order relation). The support is a measure of how frequent an event is appearing in the sequence.

Intuitively, it can be simply defined as the number of times that an event is found throughout the sequence.

Several algorithms have been developed to discover frequent episodes in sequences such as WINEPI and MINEPI in [11], MINEPI+ in [13], and the generalization of frequent episodes [12]. All these methods are defined to work with categorical events, i.e., there must be a set of event types that occur throughout the sequence.

The methods for discovering frequent episodes usually start the search with frequent events (episodes of one event) and, by an iterative procedure, at each new step the algorithm com- putes a collection of candidate episodes built from the frequent episodes found in the previous level, and then their frequency of occurrence is checked. This procedure is called APRIORI [14]. The algorithms proposed in [11] and [12] contemplate the existence of more complex relations (serial, parallel or non-serial non-parallel) between events in the episode. These algorithms differ mainly in the way of calculating the support of the episodes.

The general method can be summarized as: ? Input: A sequence of events and the value of the minimun  support.

? Initialize a counter equal to one (l=1).

? Build the first set of candidates episodes of length one  (Cl) from the set of events types.

? While Cl 6= {}  ? Calculate the support of each episode in Cl.

? Keep the episodes with support greater than the  minimum support (El).

? Increase l (l = l + 1) ? Build the set of candidates episodes of length l (Cl)  from the set of frequent episodes El?1.

Fig. 1. Example of a sequence of events.

? Output: For all l show El.

This procedure ensures that the frequent episodes of length  l (l > 1) are composed of l subepisodes of length l?1 that are also frecuents. In this paper the WINEPI algorithm is used to discover the frequent episodes in sequences of incidents. Then, relevant episodes are selected from those frequent episodes based on probabilistic criteria that will be explained in section III.

In WINEPI the support of an episode is calculated using the sliding window paradigm. An observation window w is defined as the events occurred between two time instants ti and ti+tw, where tw is the width of the window in time units, with ti ? t1 and tt + tw ? tn, then w(ti, ti + tw) = S(ti, ti + tw).

This window moves along the sequence as it is shown in Fig.

1, increasing the value of ti as ti + ts, where ts is the sliding time (step).

The support of each episode E is defined as the percentage of windows in which the episode occurs:  fr(E,S, tw) = |w ?W (S, tw)|E ocurrs in w| / |W (S, tw)|  where W (S, tw) is the set of all windows w on S. The total number of windows on S is equal to (tn ? t1)/ts + tw ? 1.

According to Fig. 1, an event will be observed in several windows. If the first window contain only the first event and the last window contain only the last event of the sequence then all events are observed in an equal number of windows, that is approximately equal to tw/ts with 0 < ts < tw/2.

In Fig. 1, the window width tw is 4, the sliding time ts is 1 and the total number of window is 8. Table I resumes the events observed in each window and the serial episodes whose support is greater or equal to 1/4 (it must be observed in at least two windows). Serial and parallel supports for each episode is also shown in Table I. Notice that to compute the support of parallel episodes, the order of the events in the episode is not taken into account.

Finally, Table I shows that the frequent episodes of length l (l > 1) are composed of l subepisodes of length l? 1 that are also frecuents. For example, the episode ?a, b, c? is composed of three episodes of length two: ?a, b?, ?a, c? and ?b, c?, which are also frequents.



III. FREQUENT AND RELEVANT EPISODES  The occurrence of incidents in a grid over time is usually considered as a stochastic process, i.e., it is assumed that non-existent or unknown cause-effect relationships between different types of incidents and their appearance or origin can     TABLE I ANALYSIS OF THE SEQUENCE IN FIG. 1  Window Events Serial Serial Parallel Observed episodes Support Support  w1 a ?a? 7/8 7/8 w2 a, b ?b? 7/8 7/8 w3 a, b, c ?c? 1/2 1/2 w4 a, b, c, a ?a, b? 3/4 3/4 w5 b, c, a, b ?a, c? 1/4 1/2 w6 c, a, b ?b, a? 1/4 3/4 w7 a, b ?b, c? 3/8 1/2 w8 b ?c, a? 3/8 1/2  ?c, b? 1/4 1/2 ?a, b, c? 1/4 1/2 ?c, a, b? 1/4 1/2  Fig. 2.

only be estimated on the basis of probabilities. If the incidents are considered as independent events then the number of incidents occurring in a given period (month, year, etc.) follows a Poisson distribution [3]. This implies that the time between consecutive events are exponentially distributed.

However, it is possible to create dependencies between incidents in a sequence through the study of frequent episodes using the WINEPI method. Consider for example the set W of all windows w on the sequence of Fig. 1 described in Table I. These windows can be grouped as shown in Fig. 2.

In Fig. 2, W represents the set of all observation windows constructed by the method WINEPI, A, B and C represents the set of windows containing events which type is a, b and c, respectively. The intersection between A and B represents the set of windows that simultaneously contain events type a and b that form parallel episodes ?a, b?, while the intersection between A, B and C represents the set of windows that simultaneously contain events type a, b and c that form parallel episodes ?a, b, c?.

In turn, the intersection between A and B, can be divided into three groups considering the types of episodes that each window can contain (episodes of two events), for this example F if the window that contain serial episodes ?a, b?, G is the window that contain serial episodes ?b, a? and the intersection between these two F and G:  F = {w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7}  G = {w4}  F ?G = {w4}  TABLE II SEARCHING RELEVANT SERIAL EPISODES IN THE SEQUENCE OF FIG. 1  Serial Similarity between Similarity between episodes the subepisodes support serial and parallel support ?a, b? 1 1 ?a, c? 4/7 3/4 ?b, a? 1 1/3 ?b, c? 4/7 3/4 ?c, a? 4/7 3/4 ?c, b? 4/7 1/2  ?a, b, c? 1/3 1/2 ?c, a, b? 1/3 1/2  Similar groups can be found for other observation windows that contain serial episodes like ?a, c?, ?b, c?, ?a, b, c?, for example.

Note that the percentage of windows in each of the groups that have been described represent the support of the episodes observed in each group. Then, the support represents the probability of occurrence of an episode in an observation window along the sequence. The support of episodes and subepisodes can be used to discover true causal relationships between events in an serial episode, based on the following rules:  1) Frequent episodes consisting of different type events: a) The support of the l subepisodes (length l ? 1) of  an serial episode must be similar. This similarity is calculated as the ratio between the lowest support and the biggest support.

b) The support of the serial episode must be similar to the support of the parallel episode composed of the same events. This similarity is calculated as the ratio between the serial support and the parallel support.

2) Frequent episodes consisting of same type events: a) The support of the episode of length l must be  similar to the support of its subepisodes of length l ? 1.

In this paper, the episodes that follow the previous rules are defined as relevant episodes.

Applying these rules to the frequent episodes in Table I, the results summarized in Table II are obtained. As an example, for the episode ?a, c? the similarity between the subepisodes support is the ratio between 1/2 and 7/8, which are the serial support of ?c? and ?a?, respectively. The similarity between the serial and parallel support is the ratio between 1/4 and 1/2, which are the serial and parallel support of ?a, c?, respectively.

Table II shows that ?a, b? is the most relevant serial episode in the sequence of Fig. 1 and, probably, the only relevant episode if the minimum similarity is considered equal to 3/5.

The result is intuitively expected for this example.

The proposed rules are applicable to the analysis of frequent episodes in any sequence, but they are especially useful to recognize relevant episodes in sequences that have high randomness. This is the case of sequences of incidents in electrical networks.

Finally, association rules describing relationships (some- times causal) between events or sets of events can be found from the relevant episodes [14]. Consider the episode ?a, b?,     TABLE III TYPES OF CAUSES AND SHORT DESCRIPTION  Type Description Type Description 201 animals 318 contractor personnel 202 trees 401 individuals 203 fire 402 excavations 204 storm/lightning 403 vehicles 206 wind 404 felling trees third party 207 ice/snow 405 vandalism 208 flood 406 private facilities 209 rain 407 unforeseen circumstance 301 unknown 409 another utility 302 overload 412 voltage fluctuations 303 component breakdown 413 other works 304 handling to restore 414 Phase to ground  supply 305 Incorrect installation 415 floods 307 false move 416 false call 308 phase to ground 417 other maneuvers 309 malfunction of 418 other problems  protection system with clients 313 fuse 421 incident previously solved 315 tree felling 422 fire 316 live-line work 423 restore supply by fault 317 utility employees 900 force majeure  composed by the subepisodes ?a? and ?b?. It can be interpreted as an association rule of the form ?a? ? ?a, b?, where ?a? is the antecedent and ?a, b? is the consequent of the rule.

The support of the rule coincides with the support of ?a, b? and its confidence is given by the relation c (?a? ? ?a, b?) = s (?a, b?) /s (?a?) = 6/7, and it can be seen as an estimator of the conditional probability of P (?a, b? | ?a?), which is useful for reasoning and on-line inference tasks.



IV. CASE STUDY: RELEVANT EPISODES IN SEQUENCES OF INCIDENTS  In this section, several sequences of incidents ocurred in distribution feeders are analysed. The main objetive is to find frequent episodes in these sequences and to recognize relevant episodes that are related with component failures, consistent with the concepts presented in Section III. The incidents were collected along three years in a real power system by the utility from customer service centers or incidents management systems.

Each incident was documented with the occurring date, the main cause (storm, tree, component failure, etc.) and the voltage level (medium voltage, low voltage, etc) where it was originated. In summary, there are more than 40 different types of causes and also three voltage levels where used: medium voltage (MV), low voltage (LV) and incidents that do not cause interruptions of supply (ST). In Table III a short description of each cause is shown. The types 2XX represent incidents caused by atmospheric or environmental influences, the types 3XX are used to classify the incidents involving the utility?s liability, the types 4XX represent incidents caused by third party and the type 900 are incidents of force majeure.

For the case study, the five feeders with the highest number of incidents were selected. The incidents occurred in each one of the feeders werel analyzed as single sequences and each incident is represented by the cause, the voltage level where it was originated and its corresponding time of occurrence. Table  IV shows the distribution of the incidents in the five feeders selected.

For the feeder 1, vandalism (405) is the second most common cause of fault.

A. Selection of parameters  To perform the analysis of the sequence of incidents under the focus of frequent episodes, the necessary parameters can be subdivided into three types:  1) Criteria to find frequent episodes. According with Section II, the parameters that have to be defined are: width of the sliding window, the sliding time of the window (step) and the minimum support for frequent episodes. The window width defines how close must be the events to form an episode. Its value is assigned taking into account the nature of the data and the problem to be solved. For example, if we want to know what types of incidents occur frequently in a feeder within an interval of one week, a width window of one week will be selected. In this case, previously it should be known that usually the events occur daily. On the other hand, if the nature of data shows that events occur at intervals of a few seconds, the width window should be also in seconds.

The sliding time of the window is a parameter that affects the calculation of the support of the episodes.

To minimize its effect in the calculation of the support, it is recommended that its value was expressed in the same units as the width of the window.

The minumun support represents the minimum percent- age of windows in which an episode must be found to be considered a frequent episode. The value is defined taking into account the frequency of individual events of interest. For example, if an event type of interest represent the 5% of events in a sequence then the minimal support should be defined around 0.05.

2) Criteria to select relevant episodes. According with Section III, the parameters that have to be defined are: the similarity between the subepisodes support, and the similarity between the supports of the serial episode and the parallel episode composed by the same events type.

The value of these parameters can vary between 0 and 1, being 1 the most restrictive value (highest similarity).

It is recommendend start with a value equal to 0.5.

3) Criteria to find the most likely causal relationships.

The parameter that has to be defined is the minimum confidence, which represents the minimum value of the conditional probability calculated from the supports of an episode and its corresponding subepisode. The value of this parameter is set between 0 and 1. For forecasting purposes it is recommend to use values greater than 0.5.

The selected parameters in the analysis of the sequences in the case study are the following:  1) To find frequent episodes: ? Width of time window tw = 15 days.

? Sliding time ts = 1 day.

? Minimum support = 0.03.

2) To select relevant episodes: ? Similarity between serial support and parallel sup-  port > 0.7 ? Similarity between the subepisodes support > 0.7.

3) To select association rules: ? Confidence > 0.6  B. Relevant episodes  For all the sequences analysed (five feeders), hundred of frequent episodes were obtained by the method exposed in Section II but only few of them are relevants. Table V shows these relevant episodes and the values obtained for the the parameter of selection: the serial and parallel support, symi- larity between serial and parallel supports, and the similarity between the subepisodes support.

For the sequence corresponding to feeder 1 is observed that the episodes of length 4 and above are primarily composed by the incident type 301-ST. This type of incident occur due to aereal networks are often subject to self-extinguishing faults, then, it is not observable any causal link from these episodes. The episode 304-ST,301-MV,303-MV is composed by incidents of several types. Its occurrence is due to the coincidence of these three types of impact at different points  TABLE V RELEVANT EPISODES FOR THE FEEDERS IN THE CASE STUDY  Episode Serial Parallel Similarity Similarity supp supp between between  serial and subepisodes parallel support support  FEEDER 1 304-ST,303-MV 0.07 0.09 0.77 0.75 301-MV,303-MV 0.06 0.07 0.92 0.87 304-ST,301-MV,303-MV 0.04 0.05 0.78 0.83 301-ST(5) 0.16 0.16 1.00 1.00 301-ST,405-MV,301-ST(5) 0.05 0.07 0.79 0.73 405-MV,301-ST(6) 0.05 0.07 0.74 0.87 301-ST(8) 0.05 0.05 1.00 1.00 301-ST,405-MV,301-ST(6) 0.04 0.05 0.75 0.78 301-ST,405-MV,301-ST(3), 0.04 0.05 0.71 0.73 405-MV,301-ST(2) 405-MV,301-ST(7) 0.04 0.05 0.83 0.78 405-MV,301-ST(3), 0.04 0.05 0.71 0.76 405-MV,301-ST(3) 405-MV,301-ST(3), 0.04 0.05 0.73 0.83 405-MV,301-ST(4) FEEDER 2 301-ST(2) 0.67 0.67 1.00 1.00 301-ST(5) 0.24 0.24 1.00 1.00 301-ST(6) 0.17 0.17 1.00 1.00 301-ST(7) 0.13 0.13 1.00 1.00 301-ST(10) 0.04 0.04 1.00 1.00 301-ST(11) 0.03 0.03 1.00 1.00 FEEDER 3 406-MV,304-ST 0.03 0.03 1.00 1.00 301-ST,301-ST 0.64 0.64 1.00 1.00 303-MV,304-ST 0.08 0.08 1.00 0.72 301-MV,303-MV 0.03 0.04 0.81 0.87 301-ST(8) 0.04 0.04 1.00 1.00 FEEDER 4 301-MV,303-MV 0.04 0.04 1.00 0.87 FEEDER 5 301-ST(8) 0.05 0.05 1.00 1.00 301-ST(9) 0.04 0.04 1.00 1.00 301-ST(10) 0.03 0.03 1.00 1.00  (*) In brackets: number of successive incidents of the same type.

along the sequence. Since the incident rates found in this episode are rare, their joint occurrence probably reveals some order relation between them.

For the sequence of incidents in feeder 2 it is observed that the relevant episodes are only associated with incidents of type 301-ST. This result can be expected since over 70% of the incidents are of this type (see Table IV).

For the feeder 3, relevant episodes related with incidents 301-MV, 304-ST and 303-MV were found. This situation also occur in the feeder 1.

For the feeder 4, only one relevant episode was found.

Unlike the other four sequences, no significant episode related with incident type 301-ST appear, which indicates that its occurrence was not uniform along the sequence. The episode 301-MV,303-MV relates the incident types 301-MV and 303- MV, and it has been considered also relevant in the feeders 1 and 3.

For the feeder 5, Table V shows that the relevant episodes are related with successive occurrences of the incident type 301-ST, as it occurs in the feeder 2 too.

In summary, experimental results revealed the existence of the episode 301-MV,303-MV in three of the five feeders     TABLE VI ASSOCIATION RULES FOR THE FEEDERS IN THE CASE STUDY  Subepisode Episode Confidence FEEDER 1 304-ST,301-MV 304-ST,301-MV,303-MV 0.67 301-ST(4) 301-ST(5) 0.72 301-ST,405-MV,301-ST(4) 301-ST,405-MV,301-ST(5) 0.74 301-ST(7) 301-ST(8) 0.81 301-ST,405-MV,301-ST(5) 301-ST,405-MV,301-ST(6) 0.73 301-ST,405-MV,301-ST(3), 301-ST,405-MV,301-ST(3), 0.94 405-MV,301-ST 405-MV,301-ST(2) 405-MV,301-ST(6) 405-MV,301-ST(7) 0.87 405-MV,301-ST(3), 405-MV,301-ST(3), 0.83 405-MV,301-ST(2) 405-MV,301-ST(3) 405-MV,301-ST(3), 405-MV,301-ST(3), 0.97 405-MV,301-ST(3) 405-MV,301-ST(4) FEEDER 2 301-ST 301-ST(2),301-ST 0.71 301-ST(4) 301-ST(5) 0.79 301-ST(5) 301-ST(6) 0.70 301-ST(6) 301-ST(7) 0.78 301-ST(9) 301-ST(10) 0.73 301-ST(10) 301-ST(11) 0.79 FEEDER 3 301-ST 301-ST(2) 0.71 301-ST(7) 301-ST(8) 0.72 FEEDER 4 There were no rules FEEDER 5 301-ST(7) 301-ST(8) 0.75 301-ST(8) 301-ST(9) 0.78 301-ST(9) 301-ST(10) 0.81  (*) In brackets: number of successive incidents of the same type.

analysed. Their simultaneous occurrence suggests a probable relationship since the incidents that form part of this episode represent only a small percentage of the data. In four of the five feeders analysed, relevant episodes with different lengths and associated with the incident type 301-ST were found.

The occurrence of these episodes is mainly due to the high probability of ocurrence of this type of incident. In most of the cases, this incident occur due to faults with successful reclosing and are caused by external factors (environmental).

Therefore, it is unlikely to discover if they are related to other types of incidents.

C. Association rules  Probables relations of causality, called association rules, can be obtained from the relevant episodes. These association rules may be useful for prediction of future incidents. Causality is assessed by calculating the aposteriori probability as it is discussed in Section III. Table VI shows the relationships of causality (association rules) with confidence greater than 0.6 for the five feeders in the case study.

In Table VI, for the feeder 1, the first rule can be interpreted as follows: if in this feeder the incident type 304-ST occurs followed by an incident of type 301-MV (in an interval of time less than 15 days) there is a probability of 67% that an incident of type 303-MV (material breakdown in the MV network) also occurs within a period that not exceed 15 days from the occurrence of the first incident. Other rules for this feeder are less relevant because they involve episodes related only with unknown causes (301-ST) or vandalism (405-MV), and  indicate that the probability of occurrence of several incidents of this kind in a window of 15 days is quite high.

For the feeder 2, the rules only give information about the high probability of occurrence of successive incidents by unknown causes (301-ST) within a time interval of 15 days.

The same situation is reported by the rules found for the feeder 3 and feeder 5, while for the feeder 4 found no causal relationships with confidence greater than 60% were found.

Finally, related to the most likely causal relationships be- tween incidents, a relation involving incidents of type 304-ST, 301-MV and 303-MV were found. This case shows that if the incidents 304-ST and 301-ST occur, then an incident 303-MV also occurs within the same window with a high level of confi- dence. In four of the five feeders, the incident 301-ST appears in several causal relationships. Their appearance confirms the high probability of occurrence of self-extinguished faults.



V. CONCLUSION  In this paper, the use of techniques for mining frequent patterns in sequences of events to understand the behaviour of the failures and faults in electric distribution networks is explored. It is proposed to use historical information about the incidents collected in the network to extract knowledge oriented to prevent future faults. Real incidents associated with abnormal conditions and collected in different feeders arel used to analyse the consistency and benefits of the method to deal with frequent episodes associated with incidents.

In addition, a new method to evaluate the relevance of the frequent serial episodes found in a sequence of events is shown. The relevance is evaluated based on set theory and probability calculus. This new definition suggests that a serial episode is relevant if the frequency of all of its subepisodes is similar and if the serial support is similar to the support of the parallel episode formed with the same events. Therefore, not all frequent episodes found in a sequence of events are relevant. The proposed definition is applicable to the analysis of frequent episodes in any data sequence, but it is especially useful to recognize outstanding episodes in sequences that have high randomness, which is the case of sequences of incidents in electrical networks.
