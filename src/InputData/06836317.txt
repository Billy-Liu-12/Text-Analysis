Integrated Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)  Applied to the Simulation of a CubeSat Mission

Abstract- Small satellite missions are becoming increasingly complex as scientists and engineers propose to utilize them to  accomplish more ambitious science and technology goals.

Small satellites such as CubeSats are challenging to design  because they have limited resources, coupled subsystems, and  must operate in dynamic environments.

Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is a key practice to  advance systems engineering that can benefit CubeSat  missions. MBSE creates a system model that helps integrate  other discipline specific engineering models and simulations.

The system level model is initiated at the start of a project and  evolves throughout development. It provides a cohesive and  consistent source of system requirements, design, analysis, and  verification.

This paper describes an integrated, executable MBSE  representation of the Radio Aurora Explorer (RAX) CubeSat mission. The purpose of the RAX mission is to study the formation of magnetic field-aligned electron density  irregularities in the Earth's ionosphere, which are known to  disrupt tracking and communication between Earth and  orbiting spacecraft. The RAX CubeSat model describes the configuration and properties for various systems and  subsystems, and is capable of executing behavior and  parametric models for analyzing subsystem functions and  states of the spacecraft. It is comprised of a SysML model  created with MagicDraw?, a set of analytical models developed  in MATLAB?, and a high fidelity space system simulation  model created in STK?. ModelCenter was used to integrate the  analytical and simulation models. The integrated analyses were  linked to the SysML model using MBSE Analyzer, a bridge  between SysML tools and ModelCenter. Behavioral models  were executed for a representative RAX mission to study energy state and data collection capabilities.

This work was undertaken to demonstrate the power,  scalability, and utility of MBSE tools and methods that are  available to help meet the challenge of designing spacecraft  missions of ever-increasing complexity. The RAX CubeSat model will be made available to the academic community for  further study and potential extension for more complex  missions.
