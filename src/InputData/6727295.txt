Examples of Disaster Recovery Activities   using Information and Communication Technology in Japan

Abstract? After the Great East Japan Earthquake on 11 March 2011, there are many activities to cope with the disaster and future disasters. This paper discusses examples of disaster recovery activities, using Information and Communication Technology (ICT) around us in Japan.

Keywords- Resilient Society, Disaster Recovery, Internet, Wi-Fi, Big-data, Multimedia.



I.  INTRODUCTION The authors are the members of Special Interest Group  of Internet and Operation Technology (SIG-IOT) in the  Information Processing Society of Japan (IPSJ). SIG-IOT is  one of the largest academic communities for ICT  infrastructure in Japan.

SIG-IOT was established in April 2008 as an  integration of SIG-DSM (Distributed System and Internet  Management Technology) and SIG-QAI (Quality Aware  Internet). SIG-IOT has approximately five hundred  members including researchers of network technology,  network administrators and network engineers. The activity  of IPSJ SIG-IOT focuses on the technologies for the  Internet in general and the techniques for the construction,  operation, and administration of the distributed  computer/network systems.  IPSJ SIG-IOT organizes  regularly four workshops and one symposium every year.

The authors introduce the activities of SIG-IOT in  terms of IT systems for resilient society. They take part in  SIG-IOT activities to make the world comfortable to live in  with IT system.

The activities of SIG-IOT are introduced in Section 2,  and ?EOI (Emergency Open Internet)? our proposal of  emergency public Wi-Fi immediately after disasters and  preparation for that on peace time are introduced in Section  3. Usages of big-data and multimedia for information  sharing on disasters and recovery activities are discussed in  Section 4. Related works are shown in Section 5. The  authors conclude their activities and describe their  prospects in Section 6.



II. ACTIVITIES OF SIG-IOT Just after the Great East Japan Earthquake and tsunami,  many national and local government offices, companies,  schools, groups, individuals and others published web  pages for disaster recovery. SIG-IOT also published a web  page which was a collected links for disaster recovery.

Today?s universities are communicating with its  students and staff using web servers. It was important days  for entrance examinations for many universities. However,  many universities lost their web servers because of not only  direct damages of the earthquake and tsunami but also  electric power shortages and communication line troubles.

In order to cope with such situation, one of the authors start  to run a temporal server for a university using a cloud  computing service as a volunteer.

There were many presentations on disaster recovery in  regular SIG-DSM and SIG-IOT meetings. After the  Hanshin-Awaji earthquake occurred in 1995, the researches  into the application of IT systems to restoration of  earthquake-torn country were published at SIG-DSM in  those days. There was not only the IAA (I Am Alive)  system, a victim information registration and search system  being developed as part of the WIDE Project, but also the  system realizing the same functions by phones, faxes and  beepers[1]. Kimoto, et al. have deployed the system that  stores and provides the information on others safety or  lifeline conditions[2]. Since BCP (Business Continuity  Plan) attracted attention in the latter half of then 2000s,  many case studies of system deployment such as [3]  published. Such researches have been encouraged after the  Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami in 2011.

The SIG-IOT held the symposium, of which theme was  ?Considering Operation Technology from the viewpoint of  emergency management?, as a regular IOT symposium,  after the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011. We have  given two invited lectures such as [5] and [6] in IOTS2011  to share knowledge to minimize the damage of disaster  with IT systems and to help people to cope with disaster by  IT systems.

In the lecture of the [5], the IT Kyoshin seismometer, a  seismometer with the Internet access function, is introduced.

Damage of buildings has been predicted using the  seismometer by accumulating data of daily vibration and   DOI 10.1109/SITIS.2013.145     weak earthquakes. Such devices with the Internet  accessible function, as the seismometer, can be used for  realizing more resilient social infrastructure.

In the lecture of the [6], subjects of ICT, from the view  point of the Business Continuity Plan (BCP), are  introduced. Problems of IT divide and privacy are also  discussed.

The SIG-IOT also held the ?Disaster Communication  Symposium? with the SIG-SPT (IPSJ Special Interest  Group on Security Psychology and Trust) (Figure 1). The  following is the list of talks of the symposium.

- Naoto Matsumoto: Usage of IT for helping disaster recovery and decreasing damages.

- Shunsuke Fujieda and Masafumi Oe: Establishment of the Emergency Open Internet Council.

- Shuzo Koshino: The Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami ? Correspondence of Iwate prefecture and  lessons.

- Shinji Akitomi: Disaster assistance at Iwate prefecture ? In terms of Medical care.

- Taro Yoshino: Disaster Management System Sahana at the Great East Japan Earthquake.

- Haruyuki Seki: Volunteered Geographical Imformation Usage and Disaster Recovery Assistance Activity using  Ushahidi and OpenStreetMap.

Figure 1. Disaster communication symposium.

Various usages of ICT for disaster area rescue were  discussed, such as big-data analysis, micro-blog, SNS and  the Internet environment which was recovered after a while.

Importance of fast and precise information transferring,  information regulation and daily training for emergency  were also discussed. Many of communication systems of  local government for disaster did not work at the time.

There were more victims at areas where were not warned  for tsunami damage.  Excess work of doctors had prevented  to rescue more of patients. Organization of the EOI  (Emergency Open Internet) project was also introduced in  this symposium. EOI aims to liberate the network  accessibility for victims from restrictions of particular  organization.



III. EOI On the Great East Japan Earthquake, the validity of ICT  was shown through information sharing and collaborations,  but there were a lot of situations where the network itself  was unavailable by blackouts, breakdowns of telecom  infrastructures, and network congestions. Although cellular  carriers take various measures to keep emergency  communications, it is impossible to restore infrastructures  immediately from obstacles, and to respond to huge  communication demands without limits, just after the  outbreak of a disaster. Moreover, the rapid spread of smart-  devices on recent years realized real-time and various  information sharing, and that is making communication  demand of individuals grow very rapidly. We think that  various organizations as well as carriers should cooperate  to support private communications and collaborations, to  develop a strong society against disasters. Therefore we  propose EOI (Emergency Open Internet); every  organization contributes Internet access to the neighboring  people by Wi-Fi for a short term, from the outbreak of  disasters until the time on which influences to telecom  network were mostly settled. And we suggest the  standardization of Wi-Fi opening method for EOI.

Figure 2. The concept of EOI    A. Increasing demands on mobile telecom Smartphone diffusion rate in Japan was approximately  9.7% at the end of 2010, and 29.3% at the end of 2011, and  49.5% at the end of 2012. Thus, the Great East Japan  Earthquake (March 11, 2011) was just before the explosive  spread of smartphones in Japan. The leading cellular  carriers in Japan: NTT DoCoMo, au, and Softbank Mobile  regulated voice calls of 70% - 90% for a while after the  earthquake, but they did few regulations to packet  transmissions. However, packet transmissions on cellular  phones on that time were almost small data  communications such as email and browsing of text  information. Personal communications have greatly spread  by smart devices until now. Carriers are in a hurry to  deploy high-speed mobile wireless networks by new  technologies such as WiMAX and LTE to cope with  increasing demands of mobile data communications. And     they are establishing enormous Wi-Fi spots to off-road  traffic from wireless networks to wired networks. Today,  because high-speed data communication is usual for users,  they will require making full use of applications that they  use in daily life even on the time of the disaster from the  place they were on that time. Conversely, contents and  possibilities of information sharing will decrease in  environments where high-speed communication is  unavailable.

B. The need of EOI by the Great Society Against obstacles and the congestions of mobile telecom  networks, best use of Wi-Fi in short stay facilities or  refuges are hoped. On the Great East Japan Earthquake,  approximately 5,150,000 people became hard to come  home around Tokyo. If a huge earthquake directly hits  Tokyo, approximately 9,890,000 people cannot come back  home. The instruction from Japanese government office  and Tokyo government office against that problem is to  support such people by the whole society: avoiding the  return all at once, keeping storage in facilities, securing  short stay facilities, and providing information to refugees.

Wi-Fi access point is on the item list that short stay  facilities should secure. The most of PCs and smart devices  support Wi-Fi, and the Wi-Fi is the borderless  communication medium which is available even for foreign  tourists. In addition, the nice use of Wi-Fi will reduce the  load of the mobile telecom networks. However, only areas  where telecommunication needs are concentrated have  economic merit to establish Wi-Fi spots for carriers. On  other areas, only local organizations or users have  economic merit or some reason to establish Wi-Fi APs, and  only such AP holders can provide the internet to neighbors.

On disaster situations, refugees cannot do anything but just  waiting for calming of the situation without moving. On  that case, whether they can nicely keep communication  each other through the internet will depend on  reactions by  local Wi-Fi AP holders.

C. Problems of Wi-Fi opening on disasters At the time of a disaster, it is very useful if free Wi-Fi  offered at many places. However, there are the following  problems on practical offer and use.

1) Time lag The time on which telecom demands and the influence on  mobile telecom networks are the biggest would be just after  the breakout of a disaster. Even if Wi-Fi was opened, if the  fact and usage were announced after the disaster, it is hard  to be used on time.

2) Userbility If opening methods of Wi-Fi are individual by providers,  users will need effort to study usages without enough help.

And when users move to another place, other method may  be required newly.

3) Area Refugees have to stay for some periods there, such as in  classrooms or gyms of schools, large halls of universities,  or lobbies of companies, even if there were no commercial  Wi-Fi APs.

On the Great East Japan Earthquake, some public Wi-Fi  carriers opened their APs before long from the outbreak.

However, it took time to publicize the fact and the usage by  their web site or SNS such as Twitter. And although they  invalidated security settings of free signals, considering  convenience of users, users still had a problem to recognize  free signals because SSIDs were different by providers.

Nowadays, many carriers in Japan have intentions that they  open Wi-Fi by anyway at the time of large-scale  earthquakes. From the knowledge of the Great East Japan  Earthquake, a consortium of Wi-Fi carriers[18] is preparing  communization of emergency free Wi-Fi on disasters.

However, we think securing private emergency  communication should be not a task of some carriers but a  mutual cooperation by Great Society, because our demands  for communication grew explosively. Therefore, a common  method and operation guideline for EOI available for every  organization is necessary.

The issue of area is that how we can keep Wi-Fi APs  available for disasters under the time of peace. General  coverage area of single Wi-Fi AP is about dozens of meters  and the max number of concurrent clients on a channel is  also around dozens in general, thus some numbers of APs  are necessary to cover areas. Continuous maintenance cost  is needed per AP and uplink broadband lines. Various  choices are expected by space conditions; such as who  manages APs, who bears the cost, and what is the main  purpose of APs in peace time. Inviting APs of carriers, or  constructing a self-managed Wi-Fi network, or installing a  small guest network such as FREESPOT[19], or  outsourcing AP operation, or some other choices are  expected. We think that if Wi-Fi was applied ideally for  their purpose and condition, the network will be maintained  in a best status and it works at the time of a disaster  effectively. Thus it is important that AP holders can make it  open on disasters, independently from their choices on Wi-  Fi installation.

D. Proposed Methods Here we introduce our proposal of Wi-Fi configuration for  EOI and related guidelines for its operation.

1) Wi-Fi configuration   ? ESSID: 171-XXX, ESSID should be annouced by beacon.

? Security: open certification,  and no encryption ?171? is telephone number of disaster message dial in  Japan. The disaster message dial service by telecom  carriers and EOI do not have relation, but 171 is a nice  character string that can be imagined as emergency  communication for Japanese people. Each organization  must set the part of XXX individually; that can be  different even by posts in an organization. The reason of  dividing SSID into a plural number is,     ? To avoid the problem that clients cannot continue communication if they move from an AP to an other  AP of respective organizations  on an area.

? To keep the function that clients can choose set of APs to connect for avoiding black-hole APs.

If all organizations set same ESSID (e.g., 171) and there  are several APs by different organizations on an area,  which means that there are several backyard IP subnets  behind APs but clients cannot recognize that. When a client  moves between those APs of same ESSID, it expects same  IP subnet behind them. But the IP address got on former  AP is not available in latter AP, thus the client may be  communication unavailable for some periods.

The second reason is that APs providing EOI may not  always under appropriate operation on disasters. Some APs  may have trouble on their upper links, and they may not be  able to provide access to the internet even if their signal  was alive. We call such AP "Black Hole AP? which sucks  clients. If there are Black Hole APs and working APs on an  area, clients must select working APs anyway, so different  ESSIDs are required.

A demerit of our proposal is that clients cannot move  between APs of different organizations automatically, but  still they can discover EOI signals by top characters of  ESSIDs.

2) Guidelines As well as setting of AP, the guidelines for preparation,  time period, concern matters are necessary to provide EOI  for general organizations. Because they do not have high  level operation scheme for public service differently from  telecom carriers, it is difficult for them to examine an  operative standard of EOI by themselves, and that is a very  big hurdle on preparing for EOI in a peace time. In  consideration of varying situations and policies of  organizations, we divided the contents of guidelines to  three levels; MUST items, SHOULD items, and MAY  items. Here, we introduce main items.

As principles (MUST items) ,  ? EOI should be free of charge.

? EOI should be provided for an only limited period  during emergency situations.

? The usage and records of the use of EOI must not be used for registration or the invitation to other services.

? EOI must be action by the organization so that it is maintained by appropriate manner.

And about providing periods (SHOULD items),  ? Target start time: less than six hours from the disaster ? Shortest duration: until 72 hours from the disaster ? Time to examine service end: At 72 hours and 2weeks  from the disaster  Each EOI provider performs a judgment of the service  end individually. However, it may obstruct telecom  business if we continued free internet services easily after  the situation calmed. Therefore, we defined some phases to  examine the service end as above. These criteria of timeline  are based on instructions of government office about  appropriate actions on a disaster. Short stay facilities are  opened until six hours after the disaster occurrence and  people may stay 72 hours on those places, and 72 hours is  also a target period of storage for emergency, and 2 weeks  after from the disaster is the time refuges may be closed.

In addition, we are studying how to manage  communication logs, how to destruct personal information  recorded, and how to discover and stop Black Hole APs.



IV. BIG DATA AND MULTIMEDIA In meetings and symposiums of the SIG-IOT, usage of  big-data and multimedia for disaster recovery is also  discussed.

A. Using Big data Japanese government offices are providing various data  on the Internet. These data were useful for assisting  volunteers for helping the victims of the Great East Japan  Earthquake and Tsunami [10]. Ministry of Land,  Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) of Japan has  web pages which show live camera pictures of various  points of national roads (Figure 3). This information helped  the volunteers to know the possible way to the disaster sites.

However, nothing was shown on some pictures of them at  that time.

Zenrin DataCom CO. LTD. has the web site of live car  traffic information, which shows the history of car  navigation data of many cars on the map. This information  is a kind of big-data and it made people to know which  parts of the roads can be used. Honda was also providing  the similar web site for live car traffic information.

MLIT also has various quantitative data such as the  places of Gasoline stations, places of hospitals, number of  peoples at places, places of emergency FM stations.

Combining such quantitative data and live traffic  information, we could know useful information for disaster  recovery.

After the Great East Japan Earthquake, lack of fuel for  cars, stoves, electric generators and others, emerged. One  of the authors has made maps for this problem. Figure 4  shows an example of the maps. This map is the  combination of live car traffic information and gasoline  station information. This combination can be used for  people, who would like to have fuel, by getting available  gasoline stations using cars and motor bikes.

He has made other maps combining various data.

Figure 5 shows the combination of live car traffic  information and hospital information. This combination can  be used for people who would like to go available hospitals  using cars and motor bikes. Figure 6 shows the  combination of the live car traffic information and  population information in each area. This combination can  be used for choosing which road should be fixed first.

Figure 7 shows the combination of emergency FM stations,     mobile phone communication available map and the  number of people in each area. This combination can be  used for pick-upping areas where people may live and the  people have no means of communication with the outside.

This combination also can be used for choosing which ICT  infrastructure should be fixed first. Figure 8 shows the  places of local governmental offices, community centers,  hospitals and welfare buildings on the map. These places  could be shelters for victims.

Figure 8. Places of local governmental offices, community  centers, hospitals and welfare buildings on the map.

B. Using multimedia Usually, information of pictures of disaster areas may  be much more useful than information of voice or text of  these areas. However, in order to express the feeling of a     person at a disaster area, a normal picture of the area is not  always enough. Figure 9 shows a normal picture of a  disaster area. If the picture of the area is took by a  panoramic camera, much more useful information of the  area can be obtained. For example, Figure 10 shows the  picture of the same place, which was took by a wide range  camera. We can know that there was a large ship near the  house by the figure x. The ship was not seen by the Figure  9. As the same way, 360 degree panoramic picture of the  same place may have much more information. And if the  rescue corpus acquires the picture which is accompanied by  the GPS information, this picture can be very useful for the  corpus. The digital picture also has an advantage over an  analog picture because it is easy to edit and transform.

Figure 11 shows an example of digital data which has the  360 degree panoramic picture, the map which shows the  place of the picture and the part of the panoramic picture  which is magnified.

There are also smart-phone applications for taking a  panoramic picture. Figure 12 shows the example of the  application. The author also developed hardware for taking  a panoramic picture (Figure 13). The group of another  author is also developing a web service for taking a  panoramic picture[4].

V. RELATED WORKS There are many other groups and meetings for disaster  recovery. This section introduces some of them.

A. ACM SIGUCCS Special Interesting Group on University and College  Computing Service of Association for Computing  Machinery (ACM SIGUCCS) is an association of  professionals who support and manage the diverse aspects  of information technology services at higher education  institutions[12]. SIG-IOT is a similar group to the  SIGUCCS in Japan. There were also a symposium and  presentations on disaster recovery in conferences of  SIGUCCS such like [7][8][9].

B. Great East Japan Earthquake Big-data Workshop ? Project 311- Participants of this workshop received various real data  during one week after the earthquake. They re-analyzed the  data, discussed what they can do for the disaster in a future  and developed services. These services were reported at the  end of the workshop [13]. Some pictures of the section 4  were made in this workshop by one of the authors.

C. Hack for Japan Hack for Japan is a community for realizing the will of  IT developers, ?To make good use of the community?s  develop skills to the Great East Japan Earthquake?[14]. The  community is acting for support disaster recovery and  preparing for the disaster in a future by IT development.

The community?s another mission is propagate the hacker  mind through the activity.

D. Information Support pro bono Platform(iSPP) iSPP[15] is a group to build and operate an information  platform by utilizing their professional knowledge, skills,  expertise and resources. The group will focus on activities  to help mitigate the burden of the devastated people. In  parallel, they will engage in surveying and recording the  destruction and damages, as well as researching how  people sought for information during the catastrophe and  aftermath.

E. Tasukeai Japan Tasukeai Japan[16] is a group for providing precise  information and needs to the damaged area and rescue  corpuses. This group is co-operating with government  offices.

F. IT  Disaster Meeting In order to provide a forum for exchanging ideas by  the groups such like the above, IT Disaster meeting was  held[17].



VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS In order to realize resilient society, in order to cope  with the next disaster which may happen in a future, we are  recording what we did in terms of administrator of ICT  infrastructure. And we are struggling to find ways to  recover from the disaster. We have found that tools and  ways which were not used daily did not help disaster  recovery. We are also finding the way to cope with disaster  using tools and ways of daily life.
