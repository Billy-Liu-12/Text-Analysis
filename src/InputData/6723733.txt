INTRODUCTION  Today ' s  scientific and engineering commuTIltJes, particularly in the fields of geosciences and remote sensing, are dealing with overwhelming amounts of data, while decision-makers need actionable information that can lead to an understanding of options and consequences so that wise decisions can be made.

Figure 1 provides a simple graphic with a profound message . To advance from data to wise decisions, we must first develop effective and efficient processes and tools to ensure the data is trustworthy and accurate ; fuse all pertinent data from multiple and possibly disparate sources; mine ever increasingly large data sets to detect obscured interconnections; provide situational information and socio? cultural context to data; and provide a series of potential decisions along with a risk assessment and potential consequences. While this task is challenging in itself, it is daunting when considering the amount of data available to us. During the 20th century, much of our nation' s geosciences and remote sensing efforts were focused on  Figure 1 .  Data Information Knowledge Understanding Wisdom (DIKUW) hierarchy. [ 1 ,2]  developing new sensors and imaging technologies . It was, after all, the onset of the information age. However, we now face a situation where our military and intelligence communities are "swimming in sensors and drowning in data" [3 ] .  The scientific and operational communities are truly in need of technologies that enable automated exploitation of ever-increasing amounts of model and observation data that can lead to wise decisions.

In the discipline of information analysis and decision making, game theory is one of the most mature fields, with well-defmed and proven mathematical models. This paper introduces the basic concepts of game theory and outlines the mechanisms for applying game theory models to big data analytics and decision making in the field of geosciences and remote sensing.

2. GAME THEORY BASICS  As a mathematical tool, game theory has mostly been used to support decision-making in the field of economics. Game theory describes how players accumulate benefits for themselves by employing appropriate strategies in a competitive or cooperative activity where many players participate. The following is an extremely brief introduction to core concepts of game theory, and it serves to define vocabulary and concepts that aid in a discussion of how game theory can be applied to big data analytics for geosciences and remote sensing. Game theory models are abstract descriptions of real-life decision making scenarios .

The basic assumptions that underlie these models are that decision makers are rational and strategic, i .e . decision     makers pursue well-defined goals and take into account their expectations of other decision makers [4] .

In game theory models, the basic entity is a player, which may be interpreted as an individual or as a group of individuals making a decision. Models where primitives represent possible actions of individual players are referred to as noncooperative; models where primitives represent possible joint actions of groups of players are referred to as cooperative. Game theory takes into account the attempts of each player to obtain information about other players ' behavior prior to making their own decisions . A strategic game is a model of a scenario where each player chooses their plan of action, and all players ' decisions are made simultaneously without knowing the decisions of other players . At the heart of game theory is the assumption of rational behavior. Rational behavior in game theory models is defined as below, when there is no uncertainty [4] .

? A is a set of decisions/actions from which a player  selects .

? C is a set of possible consequences of the  decisions/actions.

? g :  A ? C is a consequence function that associates  consequences with decisions/actions.

? U :  C ? IRl. is a utility function that specifies the player' s  preferences, defined by a preference relation ;;: by the condition x ;;:  y if and only if U(x) ? U(y) .

Uncertainty can also be introduced into the model by the players being uncertain about optimization parameters, imperfectly informed about events in the game, or uncertain about decisions/actions of other players and/or their consequences. Typically, uncertainty is modeled by the consequence function being a stochastic process that is known to the player and the player makes decisions that maximize the value of the utility function.

Arguably the most commonly used model is the strategic game, which is defined by as below [5] .

? N is a set of players.

? A i is a set of decisions/actions available to player i E N .

? For each player i, a preference relation ;;: i on A =  XjEN Aj , the preference relation of player i .

And the most famous theory i s  the Nash equilibrium of  a strategic game, which is defined as (N, (AJ, (;;:i) , a profile a* E A of decisions/actions with the property that for every player i E N and (a? i ' an ;;: i (a? i ' aJ for all ai E Ai [4,5 ] .

That i s ,  a Nash equilibrium is a decision profile a* with the property that no player i can do better choosing a decision/action different from ai , given that every other player j adheres to aj .

3. APPLYING GAME THEORY TO GEOSCIENCES AND REMOTE SENSING  Game theory, and its mathematical models, can be applied to many areas of decision making in the fields of geosciences and remote sensing. These include campaign  planning, routing/mapping sensors, data fusion, feature selection, and classification.

In the past five years, researchers have begun to apply game theory to the problem of multi-source data fusion [6, 7] and feature selection [8] . Feature selection is an especially critical area of big data analytics, as it is a primary basis of mapping data into information. Many feature selection methods choose top-ranking features without considering the potential cooperative or conflicting relationships among features .  Game theory can be applied to feature selection, where a player, i, is defined as a potential feature . A i , the course of actions, can be the decision to select a feature . Consequences to decisions can include performance metrics related to actions based on the features, such as class separability, target recogmtlOn accuracies, etc . In [8] , researchers introduce the use of coalitional game models for feature selection.

Automated ground cover classification can also employ game theory, particularly when using classifier ensembles .

In this case, a player, i ,  is defmed as a single classifier in the ensemble. A i > the course of actions, is the classification decision. Consequences to decisions/actions include measures of total classification accuracy and classification confidence. In [9], researchers apply strategic, competitive, game theory models to conduct multi-class classification when utilizing binary, or two-class, support vector machines (SVM). In [ l O] ,  researchers introduce a new unsupervised classification approach based on cooperative games .  In this case, an unlabeled object (which needs to be classified) is defmed as a player, i. A i , the course of actions, is the classification decision for the object, i .e . the act of labeling the object. Consequences to decisions/actions include measures of total classification accuracy and classification confidence. The researchers utilize a cooperative game with transferable utility (TU-game) that employs the Shapley value as a solution. Performance metrics included sensitivity, specificity, area under Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves .

4. APPLYING GAME THEORY TO REMOTELY SENSED DATA  This paper presents a proposed methodology and experimental results for applying game theory to the automated analysis of remotely sensed data, specifically the use of game theory models for spectral band selection and/or grouping when exploiting hyperspectral imagery.

Spectral bands within a group and across groups have the potential to be redundant, complementary, or conflicting.

The author proposes the use of strategic, competitive game theory models for the purpose of hyperspectral band grouping. A player, i E N, is defined as a band group. The set A i , the course of actions, is defmed as the decision of whether or not to include a spectral band in the group i .

Consequences t o  decisions are based on class separability metrics for the group.

The proposed system uses contlict data filtering based on mutual entropy and a strategy interaction process of multiple band groups in a contlict environment, the goal of which is to maximize the payoff benefit of multiple groups of the whole system [ 1 1 ] .  In the model, the players, strategy, and payoff (or consequences) constitute the three basic elements of a game, while the band grouping is retlected by the process of players to select different strategies under different situations . The "rounds" of the game can be viewed as iterations in an optimization process, which monitors the global performance of the band groups as a whole. In each iteration, each player considers the addition of a band to its group. The mutual entropy is calculated and the bands that provide contlict data are not considered to be reliable and are discarded. Bands that increase a player' s  ability to maximize the payoff, i .e class separability, are considered for inclusion.

The author uses the Nash equilibrium as the means to fmd a steady state solution to the band grouping problem, and implements the model under the assumption that all players are rational. As a result, all players, or band groups, operate with the goal of maximizing their own class separability. This personal rationality can violate the class separability, i .e . payoff, of the whole system; thus cooperation mechanisms are introduced to ensure the global payoff is maximized. Thus, the author employs the concept of Pareto efficiency [5] .  Pareto-dominant Nash equilibrium indicates collective rationality and the players will converge on the Pareto-dominant Nash equilibrium as the solution of the game.

5. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS  As an experimental exercise, the author uses the proposed game theoretic hyperspectral band grouping as a component in a multi-classifier decision fusion (MCDF) system for automated ground cover classification with hyperspectral imagery. The MCDF approach is a "divide and conquer" tactic for classifying a hyperspectral signature, which has been shown to be particularly useful when the amount of labeled ground truth pixels is very small compared to the amount of spectral features available in the hyperspectral image cube [ 12 ] .  The input hyperspectral signature is partitioned into a set of N band groups (in this case using the game theory model) . Each band group is then treated independently, being classified with an SVM, resulting in N classification labels. The N labels are then combined into one label using decision fusion. Figure 2 shows a block diagram of the MCDF system. In this example, linear opinion pooling is used for the decision fusion. In the past, researchers have used a variety of methods for the band grouping, ranging from a simple uniform partitioning to sophisticated grouping methods based on minimizing group redundancy while maximizing a group ' s  ability to discriminate between classes. The latter often use a performance metric that is the product of the Bhattacharyya distance and spectral band correlation (BDCORR).

In this experiment, three sets of hyperspectral imagery were assessed: (i) the well-known Indian Pines dataset [ 1 3 ] , (ii) the Washington DC Mall dataset [ 13 ] ,  and (iii) a dataset of agricultural crops under varying degrees of chemically induced vegetative stress [ 14 ] .  In each experimental analysis, the classification accuracies of the proposed game theoretic hyperspectral band grouping method are compared to more traditional band grouping methods : uniform partitioning and BDCORR methods . In all three cases, the proposed approach outperforms the two comparison methods .

For dataset (i), the game theory model results in an overall accuracy (OA) of 95%, with uniform partitioning producing an OA of 82% and BDCORR producing an OA of 89%. Likewise for dataset (ii), the game theory model, uniform partitioning, and BDCORR produce an OA of 92%, 79%, and 84%, respectively. For dataset (iii), which is a very challenging dataset, the game theory model, uniform partitioning, and BDCORR produce an OA of 77%, 63%, and 58%, respectively. Tables I and II show the confusion matrices for the BDCORR approach and the proposed game theory model approaches, respectively, for dataset (iii) .
