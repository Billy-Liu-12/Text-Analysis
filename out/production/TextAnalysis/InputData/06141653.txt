I.  INTRODUCTION Nowadays the volumes of maintenance data have a rapid  growth. While firms can extract valuable knowledge from these data to decrease maintenance cost, a considerable portion of them are untapped. The abundance of the maintenance data along with the need for powerful data analysis tools has been described as a data rich but knowledge poor situation [1].

One of the well-known tools for discovering knowledge from the maintenance data and supporting maintenance decisions is data mining [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 14]. As shown in Table 1, in the recent years, some researchers have been conducted to study the application of data mining to the maintenance data. According to Choudhary, Harding, and Tiwari [15], only 8% of studies in the field of data mining application in manufacturing are related to maintenance. Thus, the application of data mining in maintenance needs greater attention and further exploration [7].

Hence, it can be concluded that the literature lacks a general and comprehensive algorithm for knowledge discovery in maintenance databases. To fill this gap, in this paper the effort has been made to propose an overall data mining based algorithm for enhancement of maintenance management. In the second place, a medical equipment case is studied to illustrate the usage of the proposed algorithm in the real world.

II. DATA MINING IN MAINTENANCE MANAGEMENT A. Introduction to data mining  Data mining is the process of discovering interesting knowledge from large amount of data stored in databases, data warehouses, or other information repositories [1]. In general, data mining tasks can be classified into two categories: descriptive and predictive [1]. Descriptive tasks can find hidden patterns, trends and correlations among data variables, while predictive tasks use existing data for future prediction [16]. Both descriptive and predictive tasks can be performed through several modeling. The primary data mining models are Classification, Clustering, Association, Prediction, Sequence discovery and Visualization [1, 16, 17].

A. Application of data mining in maintenance Maintenance management embodies two primary  strategies [18]. The oldest strategy is Run-to-failure that means when a machine fails, it should be repaired. This strategy is not reliable and even safe [10]. While the second strategy i.e. Preventive Maintenance (PM), is a comprehensive plan based on historical data and manufacturers? recommendations that is built to carry out maintenance effectively and prevent failures. PM consists of planed intervals for actions such as inspection, lubrication and part replacement of equipment. The last advancement in maintenance management is predictive maintenance. This method that is based on equipment condition monitoring aims at predicting future failures [10]. Predictive maintenance is considered as the new constituent of PM. Accordingly, PM needing great attention from maintenance decision makers, acts as the core of maintenance management. In this regard, tools for knowledge discovery can facilitate the process of decision making in PM; and as a direct result maintenance management will be improved. A well-known tool for knowledge discovery in maintenance databases is data mining. Overall, the application of data mining in PM can be categorized according to the modeling types done by data mining methods. Here the major contributions of data mining modeling types to PM are discussed:  Classification: classification is the most popular data mining modeling [21]. In classification modeling, each record has a discrete and predefined class label and classification models are aimed at predicting these classes for each record as accurate as possible [16, 17, 21]. Classification methods can be applied in PM for some reasons; for instance, prioritizing medical equipment [11] or suggesting appropriate PM scheduling [14].

Association: the task of finding which attributes go together is called association rules mining [16]. Recently application of association rules mining in maintenance has become so prevalent. For example, association rules mining methods are applied to failure data to find out the impact of fault on each other [2], relation between human factors and man-made mistakes [9], and how and why components fail [4,5].

Clustering: the act of grouping records according to their similarity is the task of clustering methods [1, 16]. The usage of clustering as a powerful data mining modeling in PM is  overlooked and consequently there is no research focusing on clustering applications. Clustering maybe used for grouping equipment according to a prior knowledge. For example, medical equipment can be clustered with regard to their risk factors by means of clustering methods.

Prediction: prediction is similar to classification but there is a little difference; in prediction the target variable is numerical and the results lie in the future [16]. According to Letourneau and Famili [6] and Ding et al. [13], data mining methods can be used to predict aircraft component replacement and predict system reliability and failures.

Sequence discovery: Sequence discovery is the identification of associations or patterns over time [17, 21].

As stated by Mitra [17] ?The primary goal in sequence discovery is to model the states of the process generating the sequences or to extract and report deviation and trends over time?. Forecasting failure sequences over time is one of the applications of sequence discovery.

Visualization: visualization refers to graphical and schematic presentation of data in an understandable manner so that users can view complex patterns or relationships in data mining process [21]. Some data visualization techniques include 2D and 3D graphs, Hygraphs and SeeNet [21].

B. Data mining based algorithm for maintenance managemnt Data mining is just one of the inner stages of a process so-  called Knowledge Discovery from Databases (KKD). In this study KDD is employed as the core of the proposed algorithm for application of data mining in maintenance management.

KDD is the process of extracting knowledge from raw data. KDD is an interactive and iterative process which includes a number of stages. From the point of view of some authors some of these stages should be merged [22].

Generally, the major stages for KDD are considered as application domain understanding, data selection, data preparation, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data mining, interpretation, and utilization [1,22].

As well as every decision making process, goal setting should be done as the first step in maintenance management.

In this step maintenance managers are supposed to realize not only the application domain but also the task of data mining.

In the second place, maintenance data selection should be conducted. In this stage desired variables are gathered with regard to the specified goals in the previous stage. Generally, maintenance data are available in various forms. The major portions of these data are offline while the other portion is online. Online data refers to all the data collected from the actual operating condition of plant equipment and systems in a real-time manner to optimize total plant operation [18]. Due to the fact that condition based monitoring mostly needs additional tools to obtain the online data, the offline data are far more accessible than the online data. On the other hand, offline maintenance data may be collected from diverse information sources such as manufacturer data and recommendations, failure data, PM data, expert rules, standards, priority, and risk factors (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1. Offline medical equipment maintenance data resources   A useful Maintenance Management System (MMS) may  contain any data source illustrated in Fig. 1. Manufacturer data can be obtained from user manuals and service manuals; these sources may contain intervals of lubrication, adjustment and other maintenance activities. Failure data can be easily collected by managers and staff. PM data consists of some maintenance factors like Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) and Mean Time To Failures (MTTF) that are obtained from failure data and manufacturing data. Experts may provide some suggestions and new features for equipment maintenance which can be considered as a helpful source of maintenance data. Priority and risk factors are the other source of maintenance data presenting safety conditions of equipment. Acting as a prominent guidance, international standards can be used to compare current effectiveness of equipment with expected conditions. The resultant data are another source for maintenance database. Some inventory- related data like inventory levels that are added to other sources would build a rich database for data mining in maintenance databases.

Like other data sources, maintenance data also contain noisy and missing values; hence they need to be refined. The process of refining the maintenance data in KDD is so called preprocessing. Preprocessing embodies some techniques such as statistical and visualized methods for outlier detection, data imputation, and data reduction. Afterwards, the prepared data can be used as the input of data mining modeling. All the data mining types i.e. classification, association, clustering, prediction, sequence discovery, and visualization can be applied to the prepared data. The obtained models should be validated. In fact, the validating process sets the stage for a confident interpretation of the data mining outputs. Data miners in every project can get feedback from each stage of the KDD process to make sure that the accuracy and quality of its output is satisfactory. Finally, the discovered knowledge helps the maintenance managers to make more reasonable decisions. Fig. 2 illustrates the proposed algorithm for decision making in maintenance management through data mining.

III. THE EMPIRICAL CASE STUDY As it is stated above, this section contains the empirical  illustration of the proposed data mining based algorithm for maintenance management. In this regard, the largest hospital in Iran has been chosen as a medical equipment case and the proposed algorithm was adapted to be applicable to such a case. The main reason for adoption of this case was the importance of medical equipment life-supporting task. The adaptation of the proposed data mining based algorithm for maintenance management (Fig. 2) is shown in Fig. 3.

Since hospitals employ diverse types of medical equipment, it is costly and usually impossible to utilize online or condition-based monitoring. Hence, using historical data and other sources of offline data seems to be the best strategy.

Historical data could provide valuable information for equipment life estimation and maintenance management [23].

There are some researchers studying the application of data mining to historical data for improvement of maintenance management [2, 5, 9, 10, 13, 14]. Accordingly, this study have largely benefited from historical data as well as other sources of offline data.

Furthermore, association rules mining are frequently used in maintenance management studies [2, 5, 9] but using data mining methods in medical equipment maintenance is still a gap. Hence, in this study association rules mining and sequential pattern mining are used to discover rules for medical equipment maintenance management. These rules support decision makers through illustrating some facts and knowledge such as relations between medical equipment and types of failures, repairing methods of equipment, causes of failures (man-maid or common), and part failure sequential patterns.

Fig. 3. Adaptation of the proposed data mining based algorithm  for maintenance management  A. Data and feature selection The selected dataset is related to transactional data of 678  medical equipment with 92 brands. These data contains variables associated with failure data, manufacturer data, and priority and risk data. Table 2 shows some important selected variables.

Table 2. Selected variables  Variable name Description type ID Identification code Number Department Equipment location  Set Name Name of equipment Set Brand Brand of equipment Set Reported failure Equipment reported failure Text Cause Cause of equipment failure Flag Action Repaired activity   Text Entrance/exit Date of Entrance and exit Date Repair method Who repair equipment Set Risk Risk factor Numerical Others   Some of these data are noisy, missing, and outlier, thus  additional steps for preparing these data for data mining is needed. The textual format of some of the variables is a big challenge. These text variables even need more attention and preparation for data mining.

B. Data preprocessing In the first place, text variables should be handled. If  values of text variables vary considerably and no unforeseen limitations occur for data entry, text mining methods or advanced automatically extracting keywords [19] are required. In this case there were some limitations for data entry in the database. However, some simple text filtering methods and text tokenizing fulfilled the need for extracting new data from such variables. The three important and textual variables that exist in this dataset are equipment reported failure, cause of failure, and repaired activity (Action).

According to some classifications by previous authors, there are predefined values for the mentioned tree textual variables. Mobley [18] Suggests some typical factory and field problems and codes that shorten the computer data entry to four or fewer characters. In this study new coding are used for these variables. Some examples of these codes are shown in Table 3.

Table 3. Some values of textual variables  Variable Description Codes  Reported failure Leak LK Noise NS Fracture FR  Cause Man-Made MM Common Failure CF  Action Adjust AJ Lubricate LU Repair RP  Some new attributes was constructed in this step.

Applying text filtering and tokenizing to reported failure variable, the parts leading to failures of equipment are identified; and a new attribute named ?defective part? is added to dataset. Length of repair is another attribute that is constructed.

About 4.5% of data fields that belong to 3.8% of all data records were noisy or missing. Data cleaning and missing value handling methods are used for data preparation [2].

C. Statistical analysis and visualization In this step some statistical and visualization techniques  are used for exploratory data analysis. Fig. 4 shows scatter plot of tree variables: department, risk, and length of repair.

With the help of such plots the condition of each hospital department can be concluded according to equipments risk and length of repair. The departments with greater equipment risk and length of repaired should be noted.

Fig. 4. 3D scatter plot of three variables   To monitor the number of failures in a specific range, one  viable approach is to use Statistical Control Charts (SPC).

Through C-chart, Fig. 5 depicts the number of failures in a specific year. The lowest medical equipment failures have happened in February, March and April. In comparison to the other months, in these months the direct work of maintenance technicians is less.

Fig. 5. Number of failures With SPC  Crosstab queries from transactional data would provide new variables and new tabular dataset. In this case crosstab queries are applied to build new subset from the database.

This query consists of average length of repair and reported failure code.

In the next step, Pearson chi-square test is used for analyzing independency of the average length of repair and the reported failure code variables. This is the most well- known test among several chi-square tests which tests independence of the target and the predictor without pointing the strength or direction of any existing relationship [20].

Table 5 shows the result of this test.

As Table 4 indicates, the frequency of equipment adjustment in a specific period affects the average length of repair more than other failure types.

Table 4. Result of Pearson Chi-square test  Rank Field Type Importance Value 1 Adjustment range important 1 2 Part Failure range important 0.99 3 Partially operate range important 0.99 4 Fracture range important 0.99 5 other problem range unimportant 0.88 6 Not operable range unimportant 0.83 7 Alarm range unimportant 0.79 8 Not reported range unimportant 0.78 9 Noise range unimportant 0.76 10 Over heating range unimportant 0.26  A more graphical type of dependency analysis is shown in Fig. 6. The lines in Fig. 6 represent the relationship between the type of failures and the equipment; and the thickness of each line indicates the degree of the dependency. Such diagrams facilitate the managerial process of analyzing the failure status of equipment.

Fig. 6. Link analysis of machine name and Reported failure  D. Association rules mining Due to the wide application and diversity of medical  equipments it is not suitable to perform association rules mining in whole dataset; in addition, this process could be so time-consuming. Operational and environmental conditions along with operators play a prominent role in medical equipments failures. For data reduction and focusing on specific problem domain a hierarchy is structured. This hierarchy helps to focus on a specific hospital department and specific kind of medical equipment. Mining association rules in such structures result in some specific rules; thus, interpretations of the discovered rules are more comprehensible.

Fig. 7. Hierarchy of hospital medical equipment     All the rules in Table 6 are obtained through data reduction. In Table 6 some indices like support, confidence, and lift are mentioned. The first part of a rule and the second part are so called antecedent and consequent respectively.

Support of a rule concerns with the occurrence probability of occurrence of antecedent and consequent simultaneously.

While confidence is associated with the occurrence probability of consequent contingent upon occurrence of antecedent. Generally, the more the support and confidence of a rule are higher, the more that rule is reliable. Furthermore, lift represents the interestingness of each rule. In other words, the more lift is higher for a rule, the more that rule is interesting. A rule can be considered interesting when its antecedent and consequent appear more often together than expected.

Table 6. Example of discovered rules  No. Antecedent Consequent Confidence % Rule  support Lift   Machine name =  phototherap y & Cause  = MM  Repair method = medical  engineering  100 8.90 1.21  Risk=high & length of repair=high  Brand = A 100 2.286 17.5  3 Failure code = OV Action = WR 100 1.27 5.13   Defective part =  bedside & Reported  failure Code = FR  Cause = MM 100 5.08 1.82  Reported  failure Code = FR  Cause = MM 100 7.84 1.78   Brand = B &  Defective part = lamp & Reported  failure Code = PF  Cause = CF 100 1.06 2.22  7 Brand  = C  Repairing method = medical  engineering  100 6.78 1.25  Risk = high & brand =  Y  Repairing method = medical  engineering  100 2.54 1.24  9 Lamp & Lamp Lamp 77.419 24 -    As rule number 1 indicates, whenever a phototherapy machine had broken down it was fixed by medical engineers.

This rule can assist maintenance managers in selection of maintenance committee members. On the other hand, rule number 2 implies that if risk and length of repair of a piece of equipment are so high, definitely it was a piece of equipment of brand A. from rule number 3 it can be inferred that which  type of failure should be fixed in which way. The mentioned rules shorten the time of decision making process.

Maintenance managers and technicians can take advantage of rules number 4, 5, and 6 to diagnose failures origins. Rules number 7 and 8 can be used for identification of abilities of the maintenance experts and technicians.

Rule number 9 represents sequential pattern for defective part. With regard to this rule it can be concluded that if a piece of equipment breaks down due to lamp defects for two successive times, with likelihood of 77.2% its third time of breaking down is due to lamp defects. This kind of rules can lead maintenance managers to find out the impact of failures on each others.



IV. CONCLUSIONS In this study it was tried to present a classification of  maintenance data as well as a data mining based algorithm for maintenance management. In the next step, application of the proposed algorithm was illustrated through applying data mining to the offline data of the largest hospital of Iran. The results indicate that by means of advanced statistical methods, visualization, and other powerful methods of data mining, precious knowledge concerning the maintenance status of companies can be gained. The gained knowledge embodies discovering the best way for fixing a piece of equipment; the features of different brands; and failure origins and their repair types.

However, further research could focus on the application of the proposed algorithm in other different cases.

Furthermore, in the future studies hybrid data mining methods incorporating downstream methods like clustering could be employed to facilitate the process of knowledge discovery for maintenance management.
