Implementation of a low cost short-haul Optical Wireless link

Abstract-There lies a big economical challenge in providing network connectivity to rural regions in the developing world.

Most of the existing connectivity technologies incur a high deployment cost that limits their affordability. Optical Wireless Communication provides a low cost solution which can be used for Last Mile Access. This paper demonstrates the implementation of a 100 m optical wireless link capable of supporting 10 Mbps. The total cost of building the link is within 20 USD. The relatively low data rate is chosen considering the main applications of voice and messaging in these regions. The low cost has been achieved by designing our own transmitter and receiver circuits. The components used to build the link have been mentioned in the paper to substantiate the claim of low cost.

I. INTRODUCTION  THE lack of network connectivity in many regions aroundthe world is an economic problem as well as a technological one. Due to the low income levels and the low population densities of the rural regions, the traditional options of fiber-optic networks or other wireless networks are ill suited for such environments. The high infrastructure cost and the long period of time to deploy fiber-optic networks make these technologies economically less appealing and a very risky investment proposition. The issues of spectrum licensing and interference at unlicensed ISM bands further limit radio technology. Though the emerging license-free bands appear promising, they still have certain bandwidth and range limitations.

For future short-range applications, optical wireless communications present a viable and promising supplemental technology to radio wireless systems. Free Space Optical (FSO) communication is also unaffected by electromagnetic interference and radio frequency interference, which increasingly effect radio based communication systems [1].

A broad review of the optical wireless field, from early experiments through to today's high-performance systems has been provided in [2]-[10].

The link design of an optical wireless link is presented in this paper. Since high bandwidth links are not necessary in the rural regions as most of the applications are limited to messaging and voice therefore a modest data rate of 10 Mbps is chosen. The components used to build the link are mentioned in the paper to substantiate the claim of the low cost. However, a detailed cost analysis has been avoided since the components may be available from the manufacturers for even lower prices when purchased in bulk. The total cost incurred in designing the link is within 20 USD. In Section II, the design of the transmitter and the receiver blocks have been presented along with the schematic of the transmitter and the receiver circuits and in Section III the schematic of the implemented link is shown. The performance evaluation and the characterization of the link are provided in the Section IV.

Finally, the conclusion is presented in Section V.



II. DESIGN OF THE LINK  The Fig.I shows the schematic of the implemented optical wireless link. The link has been divided into two blocks the transmitter and the receiver block. The design of each block has been discussed below.

A. Transmitter Block  The Fig. 2 shows the schematic of the designed transmitter circuit.

RS232 Port: The data from the computer is sent over the link via the RS232 port of the computer. Null modem configuration is used at the RS232 port of the transmitting computer.

Interfacing Circuit: The TIA/EIA-232-F output from the RS232 port is converted to TTL/CMOS levels. This is done bv the RS-232 level converter MAX232 I.C.

Setup of the Optical Wireless Link  +  Optical Concentrator: The optical concentrator used, is a convex lens to converge the received laser beam at the focus where the photodetector is placed. The aperture of the lens is made large enough to capture the entire beam spot to avoid optical power loss. A magnifying lens of diameter 20 em is used at the receiver.

Photodetector: The BPVlO PIN photodiode used in the link has a rise and fall time of 2.5 ns.

Current to Voltage Converter: The OPAMP, OPA657 is used to design the front end of the receiver which converts the weak photocurrent signal produced by the PIN photodiode to a voltage signal.

Interfacing Circuit : The OPA657 I.C. produced a TTL signal at its output. This signal is converted to the TIA/EIA-232-F signal level before being supplied to the RS232 port of the computer. MAX232 I.C is used for the level conversion.



III. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OPTICAL WIRELESS LINK  The FigA shows the setup of the optical wireless link operating at a link distance of 100 m and data rate of 10 Mbps.

The Fig.5 shows the waveforms obtained in the digital oscilloscope at 10 MHz. All the experiments on the link are performed with this setup in the presence of daylight to get the worst case results.

Driver Circuit: The transmitter driver circuit is designed using

I.C.74HC04. Two inverter gates of the IC are connected in parallel to produce the required current to drive the laser diode. Another inverter gate is used to retain the original shape of the signal. Since the NOT gate is a gate with restoring logic therefore the output was driven from the power supply. This made the output current driving the laser diode independent of fluctuations in the input signal thus preventing damage to the laser diode.

Laser Diode: A red pencil laser diode having an output power of 3 mW at a wavelength of 680 nm is used in the link. This laser diode is directly modulated by the driver circuit.

Collimation: To avoid optical power loss, the beam divergence is reduced by using a collimating lens in front of the laser diode at the transmitter. The intensity of the light emitted by the laser diode could be controlled by monitoring the input power supply to the 1.C.74HC04.

B. Receiver Block  The Fig. 3 shows the schematic of the designed receiver circuit.

IV. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS  A. V-I Characteristics ofthe Laser Diode  The Fig.6 shows the characterization of the laser diode. The laser diode is active when the input voltage supplied to it is 1.6 V. This is the threshold voltage of the laser diode. The intensity of the light emitted is maximum for an input voltage 00.5 V.

D. Received optical power vs output voltage  It is observed that up to -14.8 dBm of the received optical power, the output voltage from the transimpedence amplifier (TIA) is very high upto 11 V. Thus this is chosen to be the optimum power level for the operation of the link. Below -28 dBm, the strength of the received signal is very poor and is equal to the noise floor . The link therefore became inactive as can be seen in the Fig.9.

At such a short distance and high SNR there is no BER observed in the link.



V. CONCLUSION  The economic viability of communications networks in rural developing regions with affordability constraints and low population densities has been a concern for a long time. In this paper, we propose a complete link design with the transmitter and the receiver circuit for low cost, short haul communication. The results suggest that the link will support a distance of 100 m with a data rate of 10 Mbps with a high SNR.
