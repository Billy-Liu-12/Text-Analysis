Use of a Multipath Model in the Meter-wave Radar Height-finding Applications

Abstract In this paper'2, the specular reflection multipath model is discussed in detail. The conception of the product factor, which is based on the relationship between the direct signal and indirect signal in the meter-wave radar received signals, is presented in this paper. A simple function of the product factor and the signal arrival angles including the direct angle and indirect angle considering the earth' s curvature is constructed. Using the above function, a meter- wave radar multipath array composite model considering the product factor is proposed. When the SNR is low, we can select a model whose steering vector is the sum of the direct signal and indirect signal. Therefore, we can choose a valid model according to the practical SNR. The Computer simulations and real data processing results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in the meter-wave radar height-finding applications.

apply in the meter-wave radar. However, it is crucial to construct an effective multipath model in the meter-wave radar height-finding applications. In this paper, the meter- wave radar specular reflection model and several important parameters are researched. A composite multipath model for the meter-wave radar height-finding considering the product factor, which is based on the function of the product factor and signal arrival angles, is proposed. Computer simulations and real data processing results show the effectiveness of the proposed composite model in the meter-wave height- finding applications.
