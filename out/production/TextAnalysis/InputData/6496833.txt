DS-SS with de Bruijn Sequences for Secure Inter Satellite Links

Abstract?Today, both the military and commercial sectors are placing an increased emphasis on global communications. This has prompted the development of several Low Earth Orbit satellite systems that promise a worldwide connectivity and real- time voice, data and video communications. Constellations that avoid repeated uplink and downlink work by exploiting Inter Satellite Links have proved to be very economical in space rout- ing. However, traditionally Inter Satellite Links were considered to be out of reach for any malicious activity and thus little, or no security was employed. This paper proposes a secured Inter Satellite Links based network, built upon the adoption of the Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum technique, with binary de Bruijn sequences used as spreading codes. Selected sequences from the de Bruijn family may be used over directional spot beams. The main intent of the paper is to propose a secure and robust communication link for the next generation of satellite communications, relying on a classical spread spectrum ap- proach employing innovative sequences.
