I. INTRODUCTION With the development of electric industry, the electric  enterprise especially the power plant needs to optimize the production process and the efficiency to keep the competition.

So we need to optimize the production process and the enterprise management in power plant to reduce the production costs maximally. In general, operation efficiency in power plant is decided by the equipment?s own performance, the design of the whole system, the installation of the equipment and the status of operation and management, etc. While when the unit has been in operation, running state is the most important factor affecting the efficiency [1]. So the unit should keep the optimal running state in order to achieve the highest efficiency. While in fact power unit seldom ran at optimal status for many factors such as aging of equipment, the variation of load and improper operation. In order to minimize the loss, we?d better keep the unit at the optimal status. So, There are two problems must be settled. The first one is if the important operation parameters can be controlled accurately.

The second is the accuracy of operation optimization value.

Most of time, people think so much of dynamic quality that they forget the system can?t get the optimal status even if the system is controlled at the most precision if the set point is wrong. So, make sure the set point is the optimal value is very important. Data mining algorithm will be used in this problem in this paper.

Data mining is the result of the development of information technology and it can mine useful knowledge or information among large amount of data [2]. Data mining algorithm such as association rule can analyze data and dig out important data pattern. In fuel electric plant, it will be valuable that if the knowledge used to improve running state can be found among service data [3]. At present, DCS is widely used in new or old power plant. DCS collects large amount of real-time data.

These data are dynamic, multiplex and connective. So it?s hard  to analyze. Data mining solved this problem effectively. Its association rule algorithm deals with intricate data automatically and mining association rule to help decision- making.



II. MINING OPERATION OPTIMIZATION VALUE BASED ON ASSOCIATION RULE  At present, operation optimization value is usually decided by the following four methods: the set values of the manufactory, the results of optimal operation experimentation, heating calculation results of variant work condition, the optimal value by self-motion [4]. The first and second method is effective only at the beginning of the operation. The third method is correct in theory, while it is hard to achieve in fact.

The fourth method will take a long time to form the curve of optimal values because of large numbers of limits. This will lead up to many points disagree with the real value. Adopting data mining to decide the optimal value is a good idea. The equipments in power plant are closely connected with each other. The boiler circuit, combustion system and electric system are connected one by one [5]. This will lead to the connection of the parameters. The change of one parameter will spread to the others. The association rule in data mining is the right arithmetic to express the interesting relation between items in database. It can be described as the following form:  1A 2 1 2n mB B BA A? ? ?? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? . The process of mining the optimal values of operation parameters is as follows: Mining quantitative association rules by association rule algorithm through the analysis of the history data in data warehouse. For example, {Load ( 1... nL L ), a certain operation parameter ( 1... mP P ), another operation parameter ( 1... mT T )} ? ?corresponding efficiency ( 1... nE E )}, To each special load, there are some rules with upper efficiency, taking the corresponding values of parameters as the optimal values at this load. After filtering these rules, the rule to decide optimal value of parameters will be the following: load ( 1... nL L )? a certain parameter ( 1... mP P ), another parameter ( 1... mT T ). This method can ascertain the optimal values of main parameters at current load and corresponding conditions.



III. LANGUAGE ASSOCIATION RULE ALGORITHM Association rule includes Boolean association rule,  categorical association rule and quantitative association rule.

Among them, Boolean association rule is the most mature one, but it can only be used to mine the rules among Boolean data.

While in industry, parameters are always continuous value, and Boolean association rule can?t be used directly. So language association rule algorithm is proposed to change continuous value to discrete value by many ways. One of the best ways is fuzzy C-means (FCM). This method can partition continuous value into several fuzzy sets that described by different language values, and the fuzzy sets are applied to soften the partition boundary of quantity attributes. At last, mapping the record in database to language value according to the principle of maximal membership grade. In this way, the continuous value is converted to discrete value?then converts discrete value to Boolean value. Now the process of mining quantitative value is the same with the Boolean association rule: (1) Discovering frequent attributes; (2) Generating association rules with minimum confidence from frequent attributes [6].

A. Using FCM soften partition boundary Large amount of real data is collected in real-time  database by DAS and DCS system in power plant, such as load, boiler efficiency, flue gas temperature and excessive air coefficient. FCM algorithm can divide each of them into three language values: high, middle, low, and calculate the membership grade of each language. Because language value can convert continuous value to discrete value successfully, the partition boundary is softened well. Given aim data set  1{ , , } p  nX Rx x= ? ? ? ? , and  {fcM U= ? 1 20 1, 1} cn  ik k k ckR u u u u? ? + + ?? ? + =         (1)  1 2 11 , 0i i infor and fork i cn u u u ? ? ?? ? + +???+ .

The FCM algorithm divided X into c groups is as follows: (FCM-1) Taking distance at X, and 2 c n? < , 1m > , initializing matrix ( 0 )  jcU M? , and setting circulation time S, 0,1, 2,S ?= ? ? (FCM-2)  Using ( )sU U=  to calculate c vectors  1 1  ( ) ( ), n n  m m ik k ik  k k  s i i i u x uv v v  = =  = =? ? .  (2) (FCM-3)  Modifying ( 1)s fcU U M  += ? . The process is the  follows. Given k iik x vd = ? , if to each i, 0ikd > , then  2/( 1)   1/ ( / ) c  m ik ik jk  j u d d ?  =  = ?   (3)  else if 0ikd > , then 0iku = , and [0,1]iku ? ,  1 2 1k k cku u u+ + ???+ =  (4)  (FCM-4)  Taking proper matrix vector , if ( 1) ( )s su u ?+ ? ? , stop the circulation; or let 1s s= +  and go  back to (FCM-2).

Because of the comparability of discussed methods, this  paper only discusses how to divide the value of load into five language values. Given   ij i jr x x= ? , 2m = , 0.0001? = , 5c = , matrix vector is the maximum of all the elements in  matrix. Initializing matrix (0) jcMu ?  and not all the element in (0)u  are the same. After clustering with FCM algorithm, partition matrix U and five iv  can be got. Comparing these five iv , the elements in U corresponding to the maximum iv  is just the degree of membership of items in database to language ?high?. The membership grade of other language values can be decided by this method too.

B. Language association rule algorithm  Given database 1{ , , }nT t t= ??? , and jt  is the j-th record in T and 1{ , , }mI i i= ??? is quantitative attribute set. The domain of quantitative attribute ki is ikv . [ ]j kt i  is the value of  ki  in the j-th record. If the value of quantitative attribute  ki ( 1, ,k m= ??? ) is divided into c language values, then the set of these c language values is called iku . 1,{ , }pX x x= ??? and  1,{ }, qY y y= ??? is the sub-set of I, and X Y = ?I . For domain  , ,  px x V V? ??  and  , ,  py y V V? ? ? , language values  1, , ,xh xhUf h p? = ???  and 1, , ,yl ylf U l q? = ???  are defined.

{ , ,xA f= ??? }pxf and 1{ , , }qy yB f f= ??? is the assemble of  these values. The language association rule is ? if X is A then Y is B?. If the association rule reaches the minimum support and confidence, it will be adopted, or it will be rejected. The following are some definitions about language association rule.

Definition 1  The principle of maximal member -ship grade.

1, ,iA i n= ???? ? is a fuzzy set on X and 0 Xx ? . If  {1, , }i n? ??? exists and mumbership grade  0 01 ( ) ( )  n  i kk A Ax x  = = ? . (5)  then 0x  will take the term of iA . [ ]j kt i  is the value of j-th record on attribute ki  and 1, ,j n= ??? . 1, ,k m= ?? ? .

Calculating the mumbership grade of [ ]j kt i to each language value. These mumbership grades are all the elements in matrix.

Comparing these mumbership grade and selecting the language value with the maximal mumbership grade to replace [ ]j kt i .

Then we will get a new database and all the elements are language values. Now defining the support and confidence of language association rule by this new database. The number of language value on attribute A BU  is called ( )S A BU . The number of language value on attribute X is called ( )S A .

Definition 2 The support of language association rule ?if X is A then Y is B? is S , and  ( )S A BS n= U                           (6)  Definition 3 The confidence of language association rule ?if X is A then Y is B? is C, and  ( ) ( )C S A B S A= U                           (7)

IV. APPLICATION In power plant, because of the nonlinear between  parameters and the nonlinear between parameter and efficiency, it is hard to achieve the highest operation efficiency if take the traditional method. While data mining technology solved this problem well. Now we adopts language association rule algorithm to ascertain optimization value. The data used in this paper comes from the synthesis data sheet of Panshan power plant in March, 2003. The data sheet includes 3000 records.  In order to find how load, excessive air coefficient and flue gas temperature affect boiler efficiency, association rule:? if X is A then Y is B? is discussed, where X={load, excessive air coefficient, flue gas temperature} and Y={boiler efficiency}.

1 2 3 4 1 2 3{ ( ), ( ), ( )}, { ( )}. ( ), ( ), ( ),B whereA f x f x f x f x f x f x f x= =  4 ( )f x  are the language values of load, excessive air coefficient ,flue gas temperature and boiler efficiency. All the value of these parameters is divided into three language values by FCM algorithm. In power plant, operation mode is different according to different load. So this paper only mine association rule at the status of full load. When the load is changed, mining process is the same. Then the form of new association rule is ? if X is A then Y is B?, where X={excessive air coefficient, flue gas temperature}, Y={boiler efficiency}. Given support=0.4 and confidence=0.8.

The first seven records of data sheet is shown in table.

TABLE I. THE RECORDS OF  OPERATION PARAMETERS  Excessive air coefficient  Flue gas temperature Boiler efficiency  1 1.469 151.8 91.13  2 1.484 145.2 91.57  3 1.350 133.5 92.97  4 1.477 113.3 93.32  5 1.406 120.8 92.63  6 1.409 140.2 91.26  7 1.3907 134.8 92.79  TABLE II. MEMBERSHIP GRADE OF FLUE GAS TEMPERATURE  High Middle Low  1 0.85 0.10 0.00  2 0.00 0.60 0.00  3 0.00 0.09 0.89  4 0.00 0.00 1.00  5 0.00 0.00 1.00  6 0.00 1.00 0.00  7 0.00 0.11 0.87  Table 2 shows the membership grade of flue gas temperature of the first seven records (Other records also calculate by this method). Selecting the language value with the maximal mumbership grade to replace the quantitative value according to the principle of maximal membership grade.

Then quantitative database is converted to Boolean database. The result is shown in table 3  TABLE III. BOOLEAN VALUE OF FLUE  GAS TEMPERATURE  High Middle Low  1 1.00 0.00 0.00  2 0.00 1.00 0.00  3 0.00 1.00 0.00  4 0.00 0.00 1.00  5 0.00 0.00 1.00  6 0.00 1.00 0.00  7 0.00 0.11 0.87  Then convert other parameters with the same method and the whole database is Boolean data type now. Frequent attributes formed by Boolean association rule are shown in table 4. In the table, EAC means excessive air coefficient, FGT means flue gas temperature and BE means boiler efficiency.

TABLE IV. LARGE 1-ITEMSETS  Item Sets Support  EAC   high 0.4285  EAC  high 0.4285  FGT    low 0.5714  BE    high 0.5714  BE   middle 0.4285  All frequent candidate 2-items are in table 5.

TABLE V. CANDIDATE 2-ITEMSETS  Item Sets Support EAC high,  BE  hige 0.1429  EAC high,  BE  middle 0.2857  EAC middle,  BE  hige 0.2857  EAC  middle,  BE  middle 0.1429  FGT low,   BE  high 0.5714  Frequency 2-item is only one. It is ?FGT low, BE is high?. At last, association rule ?if flue gas temperature is low, then boiler efficiency is high? is got, and the confidence is 98%. This rule can be proved right in theory because the formula of boiler efficiency is as follows:  2 3 4 5 6100 ( )%q q q q q? = ? + + + +         (8)  where 2q is flue gas loss. 3q  and 4q  are incomplete combustion loss. 5q is radiating loss. 6q is clinker heat loss [7]. When flue gas temperature is low, flue gas loss will be low accordingly. Therefore the efficiency of boiler will be high.

According to FCM algorithm, the flue gas temperature between 110 degrees centigrade ?nd 135 degrees centigrade is considered as low, and boiler efficiency higher than 92.5% is considered as high. So, when the load is 100%, in order to get optimal efficiency, flue gas temperature should be between 110 degrees centigrade? ???? 135 degrees centigrade. Operation  optimization value can take the center of the region, that is 122.5 degrees centigrade.



V. CONCLUSION This paper emphasized on power plant operation  optimization, and proposed language association rule algorithm to fine operation optimization value. This algorithm takes a full consideration of real-time data. So the optimal value mined by this method can reflect the practical condition of unit. It is feasible and accurate.
