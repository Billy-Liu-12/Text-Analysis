I. INTRODU CTION    Industrial boiler is a kind of important equipment in  industrial production. Because of the complexity of  structure and special running environment, and the design,  manufacturing, installation, management of the boiler are  less of experiences, the normal fault rate is very high, the  harmfulness of fault caused serious consequences and  great economic losses[l). So we have to know the state of  equipment in running time and find out the fault early,  judge the causes and location of the fault, forecast the  tendency of fault. As the fast development of database and  automatic technique, monitoring systems are installed in  most of the important equipments, which can collect all  kinds of data and parameters of running equipment that  reflect the state of the equipment, large databases are  formed. These data and parameters include all the  character of equipment, but the character of data and  parameters are not clear and not intuitive [2],[ 3 ).

Datamining is a kind of technique which can extract useful  information and knowledge that are unknown prior from a  large number of incomplete, noisy, fuzzy or random data.

Nowadays, datamining has been applied in fault diagnosis  by many researchers domestic and overseas, who has  achieve success. But the research is still having some  978-1 -4244 -7956-611 0/$26.00 20 10 IEEE   shortcomings, such as real-time performance is not good,  the rules produced are not accurate and so on[4]-[6).

Considering the real time and reliability of fault diagnosis,  this paper proposed a method which is combined by  competitive agglomeration and fuzzy association rules.

This method has a better effect and could produce more  accurate association rules, which provide an effective  method to diagnosis of industrial boiler.



II. BRIEF INTRODU CTION OF ALGORITHM  The history database of data collection and monitor  system include many kinds of data, such as analog input,  digital input, calculated quantities, pulse input, and so on.

Every kind of data has large amount of data points, analog  input include flow rate of main boiler feed water,  temperature of main vapor, etc; Digital input include feed  water switch, air feeder switch, etc. As the Boolean  association rules algorithm is mature day by day, which we    can use to deal with the digital data. In the case of analog  data, we can change them into Boolean data quite  naturally[7). Clustering algorithm can partition the  dereferencing of quantitative attributes into many intervals,  which could reflect the real distribution of data effectively.

A. competitive agglomeration algorithms  Competitive agglomeration algorithms have the  advantage of both hierarchical clustering and partition  clustering, for the different given initial number of class,  competitive agglomeration algorithms can change the  number of class as the iteration process goes. Some poor  competitiveness class, which has a smaller base value than  given threshold value, will be extinct in the iteration  process. Finally, we could get an optimized clustering  number, which can reflect the real distribution of data  effectively, and quantitative attributes could be discretized  into several optimized interval [8).

Competitive agglomeration algorithms is a kind of  fuzzy clustering, the basic idea of which is to find the  center of classes, B = {VI"' v c } , and the fuzzy partition  matrix (u ij L n and so as to minimize the objective  function:  J = It(uufd2(xj,vJ-aI[i>ij]2  c  " -1(1 < . < 1 < . < )  In the  .

Set initial number of class C=Cmax, set S , which is a  arbitrary small real number, initialize the number of  iteration k=O, initialize fuzzy partition matrix vOl,  calculate the cardinal number of clustering,   Ni == ? >ij (l?j?c)  j?1 , using the partition matrix VO) to    Vi = f (uij Y Xj If (Uij Y (1 ? i ? c)  calculate pI pI  Repeat the following steps as k=O, 1, ...

B. Fuzzy association rules mining algorithm  The quantitative attributes ip"" im can be divided into  several fuzzy classes Ip,1m by competitive   agglomeration algorithm, which IS recorded  asil (1)"" ,il VI)'''' i", (1),." i (l., ) .

From the database T={tj, .. tn } we can create a new  database. The different fuzzy class can act as the attribute  of the new database. Because the attributes are fuzzy set,  so we call this attributes as fuzzy attributes. We can use the  method below to value the fuzzy attributes of the new  database. In the new database, the value of/h attribute on  attribute ij (1) is the value of degree of membership of /h  attribute in fuzzy set il (1) .  The new database includes  1 + ... +1 I m fuzzy attributes, and n records. We can still    denote the set formed by all the fuzzy attributes as I, in  which all the elements are fuzzy set. All the records  formed a set T == ?p'" t J, we can easy to know that the  values of fuzzy attributes are belonging to region [0, 1], if  the attribute has no value in primary database, in the new  database will be remembered as 0[ 9].

Fuzzy attribute set X called as the antecedent of fuzzy  association rules. The number of fuzzy attribute in Fuzzy  attribute set X is called as the length of it. The Fuzzy  attribute set has a length of k is called k-fuzzy attribute set?

Y is the consequent of fuzzy association rules; the /  attribute's value in fuzzy attribute Yk is t J  (y J E [0,1]  ; to  mining the fuzzy association rules we have to define fuzzy  support rate and fuzzy confidence level.

Definition 1 :  To an arbitrary fuzzy attribute  set X == {YP"" Y p } , define the fuzzy support rate of fuzzy  attribute set X as FSup(X).

11 p  IIT tJ (yJ  FSup(X) = -,-J?-,-,I m,,---?-,-I __ n  In which n is the number of attribute m T,  n p  IITtj(yJ j?1 m?l is the fuzzy support rate of fuzzy attribute set  X, denoted as FSup(X). If FSup(X) is not less than the  given minimum support rate, X can be called as fuzzy  frequent attribute set.

Definition 2 :  The fuzzy support rate of fuzzy  association rule X ==> Y defined as FSup,  11 p+q  I ITtj(yJ  FSup = -,-j_?l_m_ ?_l __ _  n  Definition 3 :  the fuzzy confidence level of fuzzy  aSSOCIatIOn rule X => Y defined as FCorif  Sup FConf == --( -) Sup X  We can take two steps to mining fuzzy association  rules.

Find out the entire fuzzy frequent attribute set, that is,  all the fuzzy attribute sets, the support rate of which is not  less than the minimum support rate.

Produce fuzzy association rules from the fuzzy  frequent set, the confidence level is not less than the  minimum confidence level. Following is the method: To  an arbitrary fuzzy frequent attribute set X, arbitrary fuzzy  attribute set Y c X  if FSupport(X)/ FSupport(r)c. minCmif , then the fuzz;  association rule r => X - r is a meaningful rule.

Principle 1: If fuzzy attribute set X is a fuzzy frequent  attribute set, then all the nonvoid subsets of it are fuzzy  frequent attribute sets.

P  .

Following is the steps specifically[lO].

Input: Database T = {tp'  . " tJ, minimum support rate,  minimum confidence level.

Output: Fussy association rules.

1) Apply fuzzy clustering algorithm to discretize the  quantitative attributes, and then divide the value of  attribute into several fuzzy set classes.

{ } 2) Creating a new database use T = flo' ,fn , the  different fuzzy set class can act as the attribute of the new  database.

3) In the new database, calculate all the fuzzy support  rate of I-Juzzy attribute set, we can get I-fuzzy frequent  attribute set.

4) Combine the entire 1- fuzzy attribute set except  those that have same h mark, then we can get 2-fuzzy  candidate attribute set.

5) Calculate all the fuzzy support rate of 2-fuzzy  candidate attribute set, delete those which are less than  the minimum support rate, then we get the 2-Juzzy  frequent attribute set.

6) Keep on until find out all the k-Juzzy frequent  attribute sets.

7) Produce fuzzy association rules from all the fuzzy  frequent attribute set.



III. TEST AND CON CLUSION    Take a industrial boiler as an example, there are 52  attributes in the process history database. In the test we  will take 10 attribute which are stand for temperature of  main vapor, pressure of main vapor, water level, steam  drum pressure, steam drum temperature, etc. The fault is  category attribute, A-heating pipe blasting, B-priming, C  excessive pressure, D-Iess water in boiler, E-more filled  water in boiler.

Interval partition by competitive agglomeration  algorithm  We will use competitive agglomeration algorithm to  divide the quantity attribute in the industrial boiler history  database. First discretize the quantitative attributes into  several optimize intervals, take the main vapor pressure as  an example, collect all the data to form a data set X, apply  the competitive agglomeration algorithm to cluster X, then  we can get partition matrix U and the center of classes vi,  the row element of U is the degree of membership of the  element in X. according to the maximum degree of  membership principle, the element in X will be clustered  into c classes, take the minimum element as the left end  point and the maximum element as the right end point, in  this way, the quantitative attributes are discretized into c  optimize partitions. Inlikemanner we can discretize the  other 9 quantitative attributes, the number of optimize  partition are 5 ,  4 ,  4 ,5 ,5 ,6,4 ,5 ,4 respectively. The following  table list part of the optimize partitions.

Clustering membership degree function  After the quantity attributes are discretized, partition  matrix U and the centers of classes Vi are got. Compare  each center Vi, decide the fuzzy class by the size of center,  the bigger center match along with a bigger fuzzy class.

Set f.1k (x;) is the membership degree of xi in the J(h fuzzy  set, the method to express fuzzy set as triangular fuzzy  number as follows.

S X  k = {xi:.uk (xi )c..u/xJ,'I1j = {I,oo.,c}} fi d et , III out  the minimum point in X  k  u v k by the ambilateral of class  center Vk, set the minimum point on the left side is Xl, the  membership degree is .uk (Xl) ,;the minimum point on the  right side is x" the membership degree is .uk (X,) , the  triangular fuzzy number f(x) match along with the J(h fuzzy  set can expressed as follows.

f(x) =  x-a --- ,a=s;x=s;vk  vk -a  b-x -- ,Vk <x=s;b  b-vk  O,X < aorx >b  Create fuzzy set at every center of class; s% overlap is  permitted at the border upon fuzzy set. Considering the Vi  centered clustering fuzzy set, the supremum and infimum  of support can be defined as ni and mi:  mi= vi+O.55(l+s%)(Vi-r Vi), ni = vi-O.55 (l+s%)(Vi-Vi_l).

In view of above, we can structure the membership  degree function, as Figure 1 shows below.

Analysis of experiment Result  From Table 3 ,  we can conclude: most of the rules  mined by fuzzy association rules algorithm can reflect the  relevance between the attributes and faults in the industrial  boiler system. The result of experiment shows that the  algorithm is of high preciseness for mining rules.
