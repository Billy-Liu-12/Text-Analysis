A System for Dynamically Monitoring and Warning  Algae Blooms in Taihu Lake Based on Remote

Abstract?The outbreak of algae blooms in the Taihu Lake, China is more and more frequent in recent years and has become a big threat to ecological environment, aquatic breeding industry and human health. A model to monitor algae blooms based on remote sensing data was developed by analyzing spectral characteristics and content of algae blooms of water samples collected in Taihu Lake and features of MODIS data. Meanwhile, a model evaluating the possibility of algae blooms outbreak was constructed according to the effects of meteorological and hydrological conditions on algae blooms. On the basis of these two models, a system for dynamically warning and monitoring algae blooms in Taihu Lake was developed. The initial application of this system demonstrates that it can be practically used to warn and monitor algae blooms in Taihu Lake. The strategies used to construct the system and its major characteristics are introduced in this paper.

I.  INTRODUCTION  Freshwater resources in inland lakes and reservoirs play an important role in water supply, agricultural irrigation, tourism, aquiculture and industrial use. However, the quality of such inland water bodies is continuously decreasing due to suspended particulate materials originating from soil erosion, drained fertilizer, and anthropogenic pollutants.

In China, cyanobacteria and lake eutrophication have become one of the most serious environmental problems. For instance, cyanobacteria burst out sharply in Taihu Lake in May, 2007 caused by continuous high temperature. Water quality deteriorated rapidly in water body of Taihu Lake nearby Wuxi City and the supply of drinking water to 2 million citizens was badly impacted. Cyanobacteria outbreak seriously undermines the balance of lake ecosystems, fisheries resources and aquaculture industry. In addition, some studies show that algae toxin produced under the condition of high concentration of cyanobacteria microcystis in Taihu Lake can cause damage to human liver and be a tumour promoter. It is a serious threat to people's health. Therefore, it is urgent to develop a system able  to predict the possibility of algae bloom outbreak and to monitor the distribution of algae bloom in real time for Taihu Lake, which is vital for the sustainable development of economy in the Yangtze Delta region, China.

Remote sensing technique has great potential in monitoring water algae blooms. Due to its broad coverage and repeat visit to same location in short time, it can be used to retrieve the concentration of algae blooms and detect its existence early for the entire lake. Meanwhile, with the application of high temporal resolution remote sensing data, it is possible to monitor the current of water, assess the losses caused by algae blooms, and explore the formation mechanism of algae blooms, and evaluate the biogeochemical impacts caused by blue algae blooms. Information on algae blooms retrieved by remote sensing provides a scientific basis for controlling algae blooms and is an effective and low-cost means of monitoring water quality of inland lake [1].

We developed an operational system to monitor and warn algae blooms in Taihu Lake. This system consists of two models. One acts as the monitor of algae blooms distribution and concentration. This model was developed through analyzing spectral characteristics and content of algae blooms of water samples collected in Taihu Lake and features of MODIS data. The second model was constructed to predict the possibility of algae blooms outbreak according to the effects of meteorological and hydrological environments on algae blooms.



II. STUDY AREA AND DATA ACQUISITION  A. Study Area Taihu Lake (30?56?-31?34?N, 119?54?-120?36  ?E) is located at the boundary of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. The mean depth of this lake is 1.89 m, with a maximum of 2.6 m. It covers an area of about 2338 km2 and is the third biggest lake in China. The area surrounding this lake is very economically advanced in China [2]. In recent three decades, economy here developed rapidly. Meanwhile, huge amount of pollutants from various sources was discharged to  Supported by open fund: JK20050303 Geo-Information Science Key Laboratory of Jiangsu Province.

the lake and caused the quality of water to decrease significantly. Blue algae blooms covering large areas almost appear in April or May of each year.  Eutrophication is the main driver of ecological crisis in Taihu Lake.

B. Sampling Data We emplaced fixed-points in Taihu Lake and used ASD  Object Spectrometer to measure spectral characteristics of surface water. Trios Hyperspectral Radiometer was employed to measure spectral characteristics of underwater. AC-S and BB9 were used to measure the absorption and backscattering coefficients of water. We also collected the surface water samples, and recorded the sampling time, weather conditions, wave height, water temperature, wind speed and wind direction at the same time.

From March to October, 2004, several continuing campaigns were carried out to collect samples at 21 sampling sites (Fig. 1). The sites distribute over almost all of the lake from the bank to the centre excluding the East Taihu Lake. The density of sampling sites is higher in Wuli Lake and Meiliang Bay. Water quality at these sits varies largely, from high- eutrophic to mesotrophic, from turbid to clear with hydrophytes.

Figure 1.  Sampling Location  Water samples were collected from the surface to about 30 cm below the surface in the vertical direction with a standard 2L polyethylene water-fetching instrument immediately after measuring spectra. Then they were held in freezing and taken back to the laboratory for measuring concentration of algae bloom and absorption efficient of water. Additionally, transparency was measured with a secchi disk at the shaded side of the boat.

Non-algae  Particulate Sampling Location  Contents of chlorophyll-a and suspended solids (such as yellow substance concentration) were measured using spectrophotometer in the laboratory. The absorption coefficient was measured using QFT (Quantitative Filter Technique). Fig.

2 shows the absorption curves of water from Taihu Lake and other substances.  It can be found that the absorption of water from Taihu Lake is quite different from that of pure water and similar to that of non-algae particulate.

C. MODIS data Remote sensing data of MODIS is the input to our model.

MODIS provides data in 36 channels, with a spatial resolution of 250 m ~ 1000 m, which plays an increasingly important role in the remotely monitoring of inland lakes [3]. The overpass time of MODIS/Aqua is around 1:30 pm and that of MODIS/Terra is around 11:25 am local time. The steep slope effect in spectrum caused by cyanobacteria bloom, namely the much higher reflectance in near-infrared (NIR) spectrum than in the red (R) spectrum, makes it possible to retrieve algae blooms concentration using MODIS data.



III. SYSTEM CONSTRUCTION The system for dynamically monitoring and warning agae  blooms is set up on the platform of C # and IDL 6.3. Its structure is shown in Fig. 3.

Figure 3.  Construction of the System    MODIS 1B data is the input of remote sensing into the system. It is processed by the pre-processing module, including functions of geometric correction, radiometric calibration and atmospheric correction. Then the processed remote sensing data is input into the monitoring model to distinguish the algae blooming area from clear water body. The algae blooming area can be divided into   several categories aster (defined by users according to requirement). The warning model, which predicts the possibility of algae blooms outbreak according to meteorological and hydrological conditions. On the basis of outputs from these two models, we can provide the final report, including blooming areas, seriousness, and short-term trend of algae blooms, to decision makers.

A. Data Pre-processing Module Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are  used in the text, even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, sc, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable.

? Geometric Correction  The Geometric correction uses the geographic projection.

The MODIS scan angle is ? 55 degrees, corresponding to a width of 2330km on the ground. Due to the effects of increased scanning angle, rotation of the Earth and the curvature of the Earth, the more pixels to the edge of a swath the greater their size, making scanned adjoining zone overlap between the "enlarged pixels". It will affect the geometric correction results, must be removed before the geometric correction.  The image matching method is used to determine the position of lines without overlapping, to remove overlapping lines, to re-sample the image, and to produce the image with   the "bowtie" removed. Fig. 4 shows the steps and effects of geometric correction.

Figure 4.  Geometric Correcting  ? Radiometric Calibration  The values of radiation received by the sensor are calculated by converting the digital number of MODIS 1B data, i.e.,  * ( )R Scales DN Offsets= ?         (1)  where scales = reflectivity zooming  factor  DN = the digital number of MODIS 1B data  Offsets = reflectivity zoom intercept  R = radiation received by the sensor  ? Atmospheric Correction  This system uses the image-based approach to correct the atmospheric noise on the remote sensing images. The basic idea behind this approach is that one or certain kinds of dark features, whose actual radiance or reflectivity is close to zero, exist on an image. But the vales of radiance/reflectivity of such futures on the raw image might be larger than zero, which is caused by the effect of atmospheric noise (path radiance). With the assumption that the increase of reflectance caused by atmospheric path radiance equals to r?  and the increase of reflectance is constant for all pixels on the entire image of a specific band, the reflectance values of all pixels will be deducted by r? . r? is different for different bands. In this way, the atmospheric effects can be removed roughly.

B. The Monitoring Model Based on Spectral Characteristics Equations Microcystis is the major species of algae blooms in Taihu  Lake. It can consist of hundreds of thousands of single cells. In order to monitoring microcystis, spectral characteristics of waters with different concentration of microcystis were analyzed.

Laboratory measurements show that the spectrum of water containing microcystis has two reflectance peaks at 550 nm and 710 nm and two absorption peaks at 440 nm and 670 nm. The magnitudes of these peaks change with the variability of microcystis concentration, which is unique for microcystis [4].

The unique spectral characteristics of microcystis make remotely monitoring of microcystis concentration possible.

Based on the characteristics of radiation transferring in waters, the bio-optical model could integrate well apparent optical properties (AOPs). This model will be used to simulate reflectance of surface water at different wavelengths and to invert the concentration of microcystis.

According to the model of water body radioactive transfer [5], reflectivity on water surface can be expressed as a function of absorption and backscattering coefficients:  )()( )(),0( 1  ?? ??  b  b  ba bfR  + =?    ( 2)  where a(?) and bb(?) are the absorption and back- scattering coefficients of water, respectively, depending on wavelength ?; R(0-,?) stands for wavelength ?dependent reflectivity; and f is an empirical factor, depending on the incident radiation and the volume-scattering function in the water.

The totally absorption a(?) can be expressed by the product of composition strength and absorption; back-scattering bb(?) also be expressed by the product of after-scattering unit    coefficient and composition strength (To simplify, parameter ? in flowing equation is omitted):  * * * b bw bp P bm m bt tb b b C b C b C= + + +        (3)  * * * * w P p m m t t g ga a a C a C a C a C= + + + +          (4)  where bwb and wa , respectively, are back-scattering and  absorption coefficients of pure water; * bpb and  * Pa , respectively,  are  back-scattering and absorption coefficients of  chlorophyll-a of other water algae; * bmb and  * ma , respectively,  are back-scattering and absorption coefficients of chlorophyll-a  of microcystis; * btb and  * ta , respectively, are back-scattering  and absorption coefficients of inorganic particles; * ga is the  absorption coefficient of colored dissolved organic matter; PC , mC , tC and gC , respectively, are concentrations of  chlorophyll-a of other algae,  chlorophyll-a of microcystis, inorganic particles and,   colored dissolved organic matter.

Combing equations 2~4, the concentration of chlorophyll- a of microcystis can be inversed by minimizing the difference between simulated and observed reflectance.   Fig. 5 shows the comparison between measured and inversed of chlorophyll-a concentration of microcystis and spatial distribution of concentration of chlorophyll-a of microcystis estimated using MODDIS data It demonstrates that our monitoring model is able to retrieve the concentration of algae blooms. The RMSE (root mean square error) of inversed chlorophyll-a concentration equals to 9.28 (ug/L).

C. The Warning Model Based on Meteorological and Hydrological Conditions Many studies prove that meteorological conditions  determine the occurrence of algae blooms and its spreading.

Temperature and light plays a leading role in the growth of algae. Wind direction and wind speed have direct impacts on the spreading of algae in water, which makes it possible to warn occurrence of the cyanobacteria according to meteorological conditions.

An equation for warning cyanobacteria is established using daily rainfall, daily average temperature and wind as inputs:  ),,( wtr dddfD ???=                                  (5)  Parameter D is calculated for predicting of the possibility of algae blooms outbreak. It is calculated as a function of the  number of days (?dr) with rainfall consecutively less than minr , the number of days (?dt) with daily average temperature consecutively in the range from tmin to tmax, and the number of days (?dw) with  maximum wind speed consecutively less  than maxw  days. Parameters rmin, tmin, tmax, wmax are determined according to historical data of algae blooms and meteorological.

D. Brief Summary The system developed is constituted by two models: one is  for monitoring algae blooms distribution based on the spectral characteristics and the other is for warning algae blooms occurrence according to meteorological conditions. The testing proves that the system can satisfy practical requirement.



IV. APPLICATION Fig. 6 shows water quality of Taihu Lake on April 18, 2008  retrieved by our system. Figure 6a is the result from MODIS/ Terra at 11: 25 and Figure 6b is the result from MODIS/ Aqua at 13:00.

At 11:25, algae blooms are gathering upon the water body close to the west coast of Taihu Lake and Wuli Lake.

Simulated chlorophyll-a concentration is over 70 ug/L. It is above 32 ug/L in the Zhushan Bay, Meiliang Bay, Gonghu Bay. Simulated chlorophyll-a concentration is also high in East Taihu Lake region due to the noise imposed by floating vegetation covering this area. The actual value of chlorophyll-a concentration here is low. This indicates the necessary to develop a method to distinguish algae blooms from floating vegetation.

Figure 6.  The Chlorophyll-a distribution of the Taihu Lake on April 18, 2008 retrieved by the system  At 13:00, Wuli Lake is still affected by algae blooms, with chlorophyll-a concentration above 70ug/L. At the same time, chlorophyll-a concentration increases to above 32ug/L in Zhushan Bay, Meiliang Bay and Gonghu Bay, indicating the possibility of algae blooms to gather here.

The temporal and spatial patterns of changes in chlorophyll-a concentration are related to weather condition in that day. The air temperature ranged from   14 to 18?. Wind is at the direction from southeast to northwest and at the speed of 4-5 grade (about 6-10 m/s). Temperature is favorable for cyanobacteria outbreak. Because of the effect of high wind speed, the dead cyanobacteria did not float onto the surface of water. Therefore, the damage caused by algae blooms is not serious in despite of a rapid increase of chlorophyll-a content.

The clockwise water current driven by southeast-northwest wind cause algae blooms to disappear in the southwest part and to gather in the northeast area.  Distribution of cyanobacteria changed very quickly in one and half hours. Chlorophyll-a concentration was in the range from 32 to 56 ug/L in large portion of this lake. Although algae blooms with this level of chlorophyll-a concentration will not cause direct damages, but we should take caution.



V. CONCLUSIONS Algae blooms cause the spectral characteristics of water to  change. There are two reflectance peaks and two absorption peaks in the spectrum of water containing algae blooms. The magnitudes of these peaks are related to the concentration of chlorophyll- a, which is a useful indicator of algae blooms.

Therefore, remote sensing data of MODIS can be used to retrieve distribution and seriousness of algae blooms.

Chlorophyll-a concentration can be inversely retrieved by the bio-optical model using remotely sensed reflectance of water as inputs and the system for dynamically waning and monitoring algae blooms is able to effectively detect the changes in concentration of  chlorophyll-a and dynamics of algae blooms.

The spectral characteristics of algae blooms change with season and its growth stage. We should take these factors into account for refining the monitoring model in the future.  The process-based warning model needs to be developed for more reliable prediction of temporal trend of algae blooms.
