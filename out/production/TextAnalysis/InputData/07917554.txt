Abstract?This paper introduces automatic framework brain tumor detection, which detects and classify brain tumor in MR imaging. The proposed framework brain tumor detection is an important tool to detect the tumor and differentiate between patients that diagnosis as certain brain tumor and probable brain tumor due to its ability to measure regional changes features in the brain that reflect disease progression. The framework consists of four steps: segmentation, feature extraction and feature reduction, classification, finally the parameter values of the classifier are dynamically optimized using the optimization algorithm Chicken Swarm Optimization (CSO) which is a bio-inspired optimization algorithm, and particle swarm optimization (PSO) optimizers to maximize the classification accuracy. We used 80, 100, 150 neuroimages training data set sizes to train the system and  100 out of sample neuroimages to test the system. The proposed system preliminary results demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the system to accurately detect and classify the brain tumor in MRI, that motivate us to expand applying of this system on other types of tumors in medical imagery.

I. INTRODUCTION The area of automated surveillance systems is  currently of Automatic detection of brain tumor from MRI has many challenges in various disciplines that covering pathology.

The most common problems that associated with brain tumor detection are the different sizes and a variety shapes of the brain tumor that may appear at any location. To detect even a tiny or single tumor at the very early stage prior to the appearance of neurological signs, the patient will go through several tests such as Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). For brain tumor detection with efficient medical imagery the most widely used clinical diagnostic and research technique is MRI [1]. MRI is used as a fundamental function for the early detection of brain tumor in assisting radiologists for treatment and diagnosis of patients [2].

Segmentation is a crucial step in tumor detection task and there are many segmentation algorithms that based on different approaches such as contour, region and texture. At various  levels of resolution images with multi-resolution analytic property images analyzed using the segmentation phase subsequently a feature selection post-treatment tool to extract features from MRI brain images [3]. Feature selection approach was applied to reduce the computational cost of analyzing data, the feature vector dimensions, and the amount of data required for the learning process [4], [5].

To ensure the tumor extraction classification of medical images is a primary step in many applications such as biology, psychology, medicine. Classification algorithms are varying between statistical approaches, computer vision, and machine learning. Classification based machine learning is used in analysis of biomedical images comprise independent component analysis, kernel principal analysis, boosting and bagging techniques, and support vector machine. Classification algorithms are divided into supervised and unsupervised with special properties for each type, but supervised classifier has classification accuracy better than unsupervised classifier [6].

The supervised Learning algorithms generate a function from labeled training data in order to maps inputs to the desired outputs. The most popular supervised learning algorithms are support vector machines (SVM), artificial neural networks (ANN), learning automata, Bayesian networks, and decision trees. Choice of the optimization method is very imperative to improve the convergence speed of the learning model by automatically optimize the classification parameters [7].



II. RELEATED WORK To predict and classify the regions of tumor in functional  brain images there are several techniques to predict and classify the tumor regions. In [8] an automatic classification of medical images was proposed using "K-Nearest Neighbour" classification technique, this technique based on the features of images and detection of abnormality. In [9] features extractions were used to be proposed and applied to brain image classification as an advanced classification technique based on Support Vector Machines (SVM). Whereas in [10], a Histogram thresholding was used on the proposed brain tumor image segmentation technique and applied to brain image classification which is a classification technique based on Support Vector Machines (SVM). In addition [11] proposed a classification method to diagnosis the tumor region in the early  First IEEE International Workshop on Behavioral Implications of Contextual Analytics (PerCom Workshops) 2017     stage from a brain image. The proposed method using brain structure analysis and machine learning approach. This method used the probabilistic neural network-radial basis function in classification by extracting the features with multi-level wavelet method, and then segment the region of interest areas with morphological filtering technique. Moreover, [12] proposed a new MRI image classification technique based on feature selection using a cross-hybrid of Firefly Algorithm and Tolerance Rough Set to detect brain tumor automatically.

Feature selection is the most important challenge in the classification of medical images since it assists to increases the discovered knowledge and the interpretation of the model.



III. THE PROPOSED MODEL Before In this paper a new automatic framework for brain  tumor detection and classification is proposed based on optimized SVM. CSO is used for the first time to optimize the values of C and ? parameters that are important parameters in SVM to maximize the classification accuracy and minimize the cost time. Moreover, in this paper we compare between classification based on SVM, PSO-SVM and CSO-SVM using an important 13 texture and intensity features. The proposed system aims to detects and classify brain tumor in MRI based on two main stages as illustrated in Fig.1. The following subsections discuss each stage in detail.

A.  The preprocessing stage The preprocessing stage compromised of a sequence of  steps segmentation, feature extraction, and feature selection.

Segmentation for region of interest (ROI) in medical images is important due to the various characteristics of the images. In medical images thresholding segmentation techniques are wildly applied due to its simplicity and efficiency these techniques have two main types global thresholding that is used for all the pixels in the image and adaptive thresholding in which different threshold values used for different areas. In medical images over the whole image the pixel values of the components and that of background are fairly consistent in their values, thus we used global image threshold using Otsu?s method for segmentation step [13].

To decrease time, the amount of data and space; the features extracted contain significant information of the image.

In this study, feature extraction is performed through discrete wavelet transform science it is an efficient tool that allows images at various levels of resolution to be analyzed [14]. The extracted dataset in medical image processing includes several features that are redundant or irrelevant, so that to select the most categorized features that are guided to, or related to, the most precise classes of the data. In this research principal component analysis PCA was used, it is efficient tool for extracting the most relevance features that is highly connected with the decision feature with no redundancy [15], [16].

B. Classification based on CSO-SVM stage In this stage classification of the selected features is done  using SVM. SVM is supervised classification technique with high accuracy and it doesn?t need a lot of training samples to avoid over fitting. The most popular kernel functions used by SVM technique are linear, polynomial, and radial basis function (RBF) kernel. RBF kernel shown in equation 1 has universal application and good performance [17]; hence we use it in this research. Moreover, to maximize the classification accuracy the kernel function parameters C and ? were optimized automatically using an optimization technique.

Although, the results were satisfactory further studies should be done for detecting the brain tumor with high accuracy and minimum computing time. Thus, in this research we develop a complete model for detecting and classifying the brain tumor and apply two different optimization techniques CSO and PSO on classification parameters with comparative analysis between them.

RBF kernel with two samples X, X':   (1)   The particle swarm optimization (PSO) was originally introduced by Kennedy and Eberhart [18] in 1995 and is based on the bird?s flocking or fish schooling paradigm PSO is a random evolutionary-based optimization technique in the global search methods family.  The population is called swarm and the individuals are called particles, each particle is called a possible solution to the problem [12]. In PSO particle's  First IEEE International Workshop on Behavioral Implications of Contextual Analytics (PerCom Workshops) 2017    positions and velocities are generated randomly, the particles fly through search space with their corresponding velocities which are updated based on the previous best performance of the particle and its neighbors. The velocity V and position X of a particle are updated at t time according to the following rules represented by equation 2 and 3 respectively.

Xid (t+1) = Xid (t) + Vid(t+1)                                         (2)  Vid(t+1)=W? Vid(t)+C1r1(Pbestid -Xid(t))+C2r2(gbestid - Xid(t))        (3)    Where ( - Vmin< Vid ?Vmax), i = 1, 2,?? ps, and ps denotes the population size, w is the inertia weight which has the effect of improving the convergence of search by reducing the speed as time progresses. Moreover, r1 and r2 are two random values between 0 and 1 [18], and Pbest is the best previous solution of the ith particle that is recorded, gbest is the best particle among the whole population, and constants C1 and C2 are weighting factors, which pull each particle towards pbest and gbest positions.

Although the PSO is effective technique for selecting  classification parameters, it suffers from several problems such as it only stress on maximizing the classification accuracy and ignore the number of features in the search processes.

Furthermore, PSO do not use correlated information to guide the search process, and may select similar features in the final feature subset. To overcome these problems, we use a new bio- inspired optimization algorithm CSO [19]. The phenomena in CSO can be formulated mathematically as follows. Where X stands for the position.

The CSO optimization technique is superior to PSO in the classification accuracy, execution time, and robustness.

Moreover, a complete comparative analysis between PSO and CSO was done and discussed in our experimental results as illustrated in the following section.



IV. RESULT To validate the performance of the proposed model the  experiments were carried out, that has been implemented in MATLAB platform considering two different swarms CSO and PSO with maximum iterations and population size equal to 10. The values of C and ? parameters are exponentially varied from 2e-10 to 2e10.

A.  Preprocessing stag The collected images belong to two categories called  certain and probable. Fig.2, and Fig.3 present some visual results of segmentation. The segmented images are used to extract the features which contains the relevant information of an image. Texture and intensity based features are used to extract 13 features in this paper. The important 13 texture and intensity based features which are extracted from the segmented images are: Contrast, Correlation, Energy, Homogeneity, Entropy, RMS, Skewness, IDM, Mean, Standard Deviation, Variance, Smoothness, and Kurtosis vector. Table 1, displays 13 feature extraction results for sample of data set images.
