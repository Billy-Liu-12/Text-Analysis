INTRODUCTION In recent years, the State Grid Corporation of China accelerate the construction of strong and smart grid, focus on the comprehensive construction of the power user electric energy data acquire system. The comprehensive construction of the system implements the real-time collection for the state of the metering device and user electricity load, power, voltage and other information, support massive data for analysis of various aspects of company management.

Since the machinery and equipment of Grid system run in a variety of different environments, due to the problems such as the fault of electric energy metering device, the false wiring of electric energy metering device, the exception in grid system, the system file data errors, etc, these problem will affect the safety and stable operation of the grid and the accurate collection of the power data.

As the abnormal measurement appears in the grid system,  Paper No CP0366  if the acquire system can provide an on-line data analysis function which is reasonable and feasible in the computing time and computing resources, to monitor the abnormal data, diagnose the reason lead to the exception and give maintain suggestions, it can improve the efficiency greatly, reduce manual workload and management costs, and generate significant economic and social benefits.

Based on the collected data, this paper proposed a rule? based exception reason diagnosis system for power abnormal data monitoring and analysis, to find out the power abnormal data, intelligent analyze the reason led to the abnormal data. The difficulties of this work: (1 )an exception reason will lead to a variety of abnormal data phenomenon, it needs to monitor many kinds of abnormal data phenomenon to analyze the exception; (2)one kind of abnormal data phenomenon can be caused by different exception reason, it needs to analyze the abnormal data systematic to improve the efficiency of the abnormal measurement analysis; (3)in the acquire system, there are a wide variety of reasons that lead to abnormal data, including the metering device abnormal, power supply anomalies and data error in the acquire system; (4)with the replacement of the environmental and mechanical equipment, there will be new anomalies and reasons for the exception, it needs to provide a reasonable and effective method to update the system, keeping the effect of abnormal data monitoring and analysis.

RELATED WORK With the continuous development of power-related technology, the method using machine and equipment to collect and monitor the state of distribution network has been widely used at home and abroad. In order to improve the effect of abnormal data monitoring, many researchers do some study. Parts of researchers[1][2]  focused on the analysis of quality of power supply on distribution network, parts of researchers[3][4] studied the design and implementation of the metering device  monitoring system, parts of researcher[5][6][7]studied the method to track the state of metering device based on power user electric energy data acquire system.

For the problem such as power outages and network failure of distribution system in the long distance transmission of energy, the transmission performance evaluation and diagnosis can be done by analyzing the abnormalities, summing up the various error reasons and constructing the monitoring system [1]. Some prior work [2] proposed a power quality evaluation system in the sensor side based on the web, and explored the challenges and trends of distributed power quality evaluation system using smart sensors. Some prior work [3][4] summarized  1/4     -<@>-  the method of the monitoring and analysis of the abnormal measurement, and implemented the abnormal monitoring system. The method using the data in the acquisition system to test the state of power system based on manual analysis has been proposed in [5] to track the state of metering devices and power supply. [6][7] discussed the method using the collected data to monitor and analyze the running state of the metering device, analyzed the difficulties and pointed out that it is difficult to collect all the demands for the analysis of the data phenomenon when specific implemented, and the application for abnormal monitoring in the system need to keep summary for the practicality of the system.

In the related work above, many works have already been done about the technology of monitoring and analysis of the abnormal measurement, some systems for abnormal measurement based on the collected data have been implemented. However, there are some disadvantages: (1) analysis of the reasons that leads to abnormal data is not comprehensive, most of the researchers only consider about the abnormal measurement; (2) all of the work above didn't take full advantage to use the experience data in the monitoring system to optimize the system. In this paper we analyze most of the abnormal data that may produced in the acquisition system, design a method to  learn the experience and knowledge in the experience data to optimize the effect of analysis.

A RULE-BASED EXCEPTION REASON  DIAGNOSIS SYSTEM FOR ELECTRIC  POWER DATA This section describes the rule-based exception reason diagnosis system for electric power data. First, we introduce the basic defmition of association rules, then introduce the defmition of abnormal data characteristics set and the exception reason set, association rules knowledge base and its construction method. At last we propose the rule-based exception reason diagnosis algorithm and knowledge base update algorithm.

The basic principles of association rules The diagnosis of the exception reason for the power  abnormal data can be divided into two steps: first,  monitor the abnormal data phenomenon, analyze the data characteristics; second, diagnose the exception reason based on the characteristics. The diagnosis for the exception reason is a classification process for abnormal data. With the certain correlation among the abnormal data phenomenon, there are many-to-many relationships between data characteristics and exception reason, so we use the classification algorithm based on association ru I es [8][9].

Assuming that set X = {Xl' x2' x3'???' xN} has N different items, set Y = {Y\,Y2'Y3'???'YM} has M different items. In a transaction database T = {tptZ,t3,???,tp} which has P  Paper No CP0366  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  Paper CP0366  transactions, transaction ti contains two item set C; and Ri, having Ci eX, Ri c Y and 1:s; i :s; P . An association rule is one implication like OC => ER , in which set DC is the antecedent and set ER is the consequent of the association rule, having DC e X , ER c Y and DC n ER = 0 . An association rule DC => ER is established when it satisfies two requirements: (I) it has a support S, which means at least S% of the transactions in  the database T have DC c C i and ER c Ri; (2)it has a confidence F, which means in the transactions in T that  satisfy C, ::::J DC , at least F% of them satisfy Ri ::::J ER at the same time.

Abnormal data characteristic set, exception  reason set and the instantiation of the association  rules Power anomaly data, refers to the abnormal data generated in the power user electric energy data acquire system caused by some abnormalities, such as the fault of electric energy metering device, the false wiring of electric energy metering device, the exception in grid system, the system file data errors, etc, which will be detected with abnormal analysis algorithm.

Abnormal data characteristic refers to the abnormal  phenomenon found in the abnormal data. The system quantify the data characteristics with some algorithm.

Exception reason refers to the real reasons that lead to power anomaly data, such as the fault of electric energy metering device, etc.

Through the analysis and arrangement for the power anomaly data found in the acquire system, we concluded an abnormal data characteristic set and an exception reason set. According to the anomaly phenomenon of the characteristics, abnormal data characteristics are divided into 14 categories, 48 characteristics, each characteristic has an analysis algorithm. Classification of characteristics is shown in Table 1.

Table 2. Exception Reason Set  Code Exception reason categories Number a Exception in grid system 7 b Fault of electric energy metering device 14 c Net exception in acquire system 4 d File data exception in acquire system 4 e Else situation 5  After Completmg the mstantlatIOn of the aSSOCIatIOn rules based on abnormal data characteristic set and exception reason set, we can use the classification algorithm to diagnose the exceptions.

Assuming that X = {Xl' X2' Xl' ? ? ?  , xN} is the abnormal data characteristic set, Y = {Yl'Y2'Y3' ... 'YM} is the exception reason set, every anomaly record is a transaction ti which is a record of the database T. Each ti contains a  characteristic set Ci and a reason Ri, having C, c X , R; ? Y and 1::;; i ::;; P .  The association rules between the abnormal data characteristics and the exception reason is defined as: An association rule is one implication like DC ::::;> ER , contain an characteristic set DC as the antecedent and an exception reason ER as the consequent, having DC c X, ER E Y and ER ? DC .  The support S means that S% of  the abnormal data records in T, satisty DC c C; and  ER = Ri . S is shown in equation (1):  I{t; I( C; ::J DC)and (R; =ER) and (t; E T)}I s=  ITI xlOO (1)  The confidence F means that at least F% of the  transactions which satisfy C;::J DC, satisfy 1\ = ER at the same time. F is shown in equation (2):  l{t,I(C, ::JDC)and(R,=ER)and(t, ET)}I F= xlOO (2)  l{t,I(C, ::JDC)and(t, ET)}I SO, according to an association rule DC ::::;> ER , if the  requirement that ti satisfy C;::J DC is known, ti has a probability F% that it satisfies 1\ = ER .

Association rule base and exception diagnosis According to the definition of the association rule,  through exception record collection and manual analysis we can get a number of association rules to form an association rules knowledge base.

Assuming the association rules knowledge base is set K  withl::::k:::: IK I , K={DCk=>ERkIDCkcX and ERkEY}.

For each characteristic set DC, it can be mapped to different exception reason in different association rule.

There are inclusion relations between different set DC.

When a collection point's data is found abnormal, analyze the characteristic set DC for it, then search the association rules related to DC in K, while ER is the consequent and F is the confidence of the rules, then the exception reason  Paper No CP0366  J    Paper CP0366  diagosis will be done. The steps are as follows : (1) search for all the association rules related to DC in K ; (2) record the ER and F of the rules that found; (3) try to find the largest F of the rules found in (2); (4) return ER and F of the rule with the largest F.

Then the consequent ER is the exception reason after diagnosis, F means the certainty of diagnosis.

Correct the knowledge base of association rules The knowledge base of association rules is build on the basis of the historical experience of exception data analysis. [t can also learn the experience data when the diagnosis system is running. With the method of machine learning, mining the new real world experience data, the original rule will be corrected and new rule should be discovered.

When the diagnosis system gets new experience record, it may update the knowledge base. Assuming that the characteristic set of the new record is DC, the exception  reason is ER, for any one set DCk that satisfies DCk c DC , update the rule DCk => ER; if the rule didn't exist, create it.

[n addition, the system can modify the abnormal data characteristic set and the exception reason set based on the actual needs. The system may generate some association rules with low support for contingency event.

that The rule doesn't have reference value while the support of the rule is so low. System will do pruning for the association rules with low support on time.

FRAMEWORK DESIGN OF THE DIAGNOSIS  SYSTEM  Exception reason diagnosis system for electric power data is based on the knowledge base, which uses the characteristic analysis algorithms to monitor and discover the abnormal data, analyze the characteristics, and implement the exception reason diagnosis. The function framework of the system is as shown in Figure 1.

The flow chart of the system  APPLICATIONS  At present, the rule-based exception reason diagnosis system is a supplement for the power user electric energy data acquire system in Fujian province. The system began running in January 2012 and is currently in testing phase.

The user feedback indicates that the system can improve the efficiency of exception investigation for electric staff : (l)more than 95 percent of the points with abnormal data established the existence of abnormal conditions; (2)more than 87 percent of the points' real exception  reasons are as same as the reason that system suggests; (3)system effectively reduce the time of the investigation to make the work efficient by providing analysis result.

The applications of the system show that abnormal data characteristic analysis methods play well both in exception discovery and characteristic analysis. More than 87% of the exception reasons that system supports are true, which proves the accuracy of the exception reason diagnosis. With more using of the system, correcting the knowledge base, the system will support the abnormal data monitoring and analysis work better.

The applications show that the system can play a great role in monitoring and diagnosis of power abnormal data.

CONCLUSION  In this paper, we present an exception reason diagnosis system for electric power data. Based on the expert  experience, we abstract an abnormal data characteristic set and an exception reason set, set up a knowledge base of association rules to describe the relationship between the data characteristics and the exception reasons. Each rule contains an abnormal data characteristic set and an exception reason R, where all the abnormal data characteristics are antecedents and the exception reason R is consequent. Based on the knowledge base, we construct an exception reason diagnosis system for electric power data, using a rule-based classification method to diagnose the exception reason for the abnormal data. The system contains the function learning the experience data to correct the knowledge base.
