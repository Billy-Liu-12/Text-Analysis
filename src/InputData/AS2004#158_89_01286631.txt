Abstract Transactional association analysis deals with establishing associations among transactional items in the form of rules.  The effects of business rules on the outcome of such analysis are widely ignored, while attention has been misapplied to the mining of different patterns. Ignoring such business rules may result in association rules that are biased.  This paper addresses the effects of business rules on transactional association analyses for single level Boolean associations.  Specifically, the research goal is to determine what level of bargain (if any) for a group of transactional items affects the number and the contents of association rules.

Key Words: Data Mining, Transactional Association Analysis, Business Rule, Association Rule 1. Introduction Transactional association analysis (TAA) deals with establishing associations among the transactional items.

Such associations are manifested in form of association rules.  That is, the association of the transactional item X with the transactional item Y is denoted as X ? Y, which means any customer who includes item X in his transaction, may also include item Y.   Since the rule is not true for every transaction that takes place, two parameters of ?support?, s, and ?confidence?, c, are assigned to each association rule.  The support s is equal to P(X ? Y) = (frequency of transactions including both X and Y) / Total number of transactions) and the confidence c is equal to P(Y | X) = (frequency of transactions including both X and Y) / (frequency of transactions including X).  For the details of transactional association analysis, consult [1, 2, 3].

The effects of business rules on the outcome of TAA are widely ignored while attention has been focused on the mining of different patterns of interest [4, 5, 6, 7, 8].

Ignoring the business rules may result in association rules that are biased.  To explain this further, suppose that we have established the fact that whoever buys a ?DVD player?, for instance, also buys a ?DVD movie?.  This association is biased, if we assume that the following business rule was effective for the last ten months and the dataset that is subject to the mining process has been collected for the last year: Buy a DVD player and get a free DVD movie.

This paper addresses the effects of business rules on TAA for single level Boolean association rules.

Specifically, the research goal is to determine what level of bargain for a group of transactional items affects both the number and the contents of association rules.

The next section provides a background about mining single level Boolean association rules.  Section 3.0 describes the methodology.  Section 4.0 presents the experiments and results.  And Section 5.0 offers conclusions and directions for future research.

2. Background Mining single level Boolean association rules may be completed using Apriori algorithm.  For details, consult [9, 10, 11].  This algorithm first identifies the frequent itemsets for a given transactional dataset, and then creates association rules from these frequent itemsets.

An itemset is a group of transactional items that are appeared together in a set of transactions with a support value greater than or equal to a threshold.  All the subsets of an itemset also must have a support value greater than    of an itemset also must have a support value greater than or equal to the threshold.  The number of items in an itemset is used to name the itemset.  For example, 1- itemset, 2-itemset, ... and k-itemset.   The j-itemset includes j transactional items and it is built by (a) joining the (j-1)-itemset with itself, (b) eliminating those j- itemsets with frequencies less than the given threshold, (ITCC?04) 0-7695-2108-8/04 $ 20.00 ? 2004 IEEE and (c) eliminating those j-itemsets whose subsets are not in the list of the (j-1)-itemsets.  These three steps (i.e., a, b and c) are employed to create (j+1)-itemsets from j- itemsets,  (j+2)-itemsets from (j+1) itemsets, and so forth.

This process continues until the (j + n)-itemsets becomes empty.  At the end, there is a list of non-empty itemsets.

The creation of associate rules from each non-empty itemset takes place in the following steps.  (a)  Every possible subset of a non-empty itemset is generated.  For example, if the itemset is a three itemset of {I6, I75, I8}, then all the possible subsets are {I6, I75}, {I6, I8}, {I75, I8}, {I6}, {I75}, and {I8}.  (b)  Each subset is transformed into a rule that the antecedents are the anded items in the subset and the conclusion is the anded items missing from the subset.  As a result, the association rules generated from the three itemset of {I6, I75, I8} are: (I6 ? I75 ?  I8), (I6 ? I8 ?  I75), (I75 ? I8 ?  I6), (I6?  I75 ? I8), (I75? I6 ? I8), (I8 ?   I6 ? I75).

For each association rule of X ? Y, the confidence is defined by freq(X ? Y) / freq(X).  The confidence may be used to prune the set of rules further.

3. Methodology The next few paragraphs define critical terms used in the analysis.  A short-lived rule is a rule that is applicable for a short period of time.  The duration may be from several hours to several months.  Business rules are a set of short-lived rules that are generated by local, regional or national managers.  Manufacturers also use such rules to (a) promote new products, (b) quickly sell a product due to aging or surplus, (c) attract a specific group of customers, and/or (d) motivate regular customers.  Table 1 shows a sample of business rules for a grocery store chain.

No matter how a business rule is drafted, it always facilitates selling of an item through discount.  The discount level (L) provided by a business rule is in the range of 0 ? L &lt; 1 and in the majority of cases, L &lt; 0.5.

The discount of L = 0.5 and 0.75 means the customer can buy two or four of the same item for the price of one, respectively.

A business rule has two parts, antecedents (e. g., buy item I1) and conclusions (e. g., get discount on items Ia, ..

Iz).   Item I1 participates in the antecedent of the business rule while Ia, .., Iz participate in the conclusion of the business rule  The analysis refers to I1 as the source item and Ia, .., Iz as the affiliate items.  The source item may be made of a set of items.  As a result, there are three  categories of business rules (i.e., categories I, II and III) for which the cardinality of the set of items in the source is 0, 1 and &gt;1, respectively.

Since the business rules are short-lived, their effects on the purchasing behavior of customers are for a short period of time.  Considering the fact that the TAA is done on a dataset that is collected for a much longer period of time, one may argue that the effects of business rules may be rightfully ignored.  In response to this argument, some effects can be ignored but not all of them.

3.1. Itemset Generation Let G and R be a dataset including all the transactions for a given enterprise and a set of business rules for the same enterprise, respectively.  The i-th business rule gives a discount level of Li to the transactional items that are effected by the rule.  The j-th transactional item has a bargain level of Bj = 6 (Li ) / m   (for i= 1 to m), where m is the number of business rules that can be applied on the j-th transactional item.  Please note that discounts associated with a business rule and transactional item are referred to as ?discount level? and ?bargain level?, respectively.

As noted in the background section, all the qualified itemsets (1-itemset, ..., k-itemsets) are built for a transactional dataset.  Each itemset is used to derive the association rules.  Itemset development is based on a given, desired support value that, in turn, is calculated based on the frequency of the transactional items in a (ITCC?04) 0-7695-2108-8/04 $ 20.00 ? 2004 IEEE given transactional dataset.  The frequency is simply the count of a given transactional item in the dataset.  This frequency must be greater than a threshold value (support frequency) to qualify an item or itemset for forming a new itemset.  The effects of business rules are manifested in the calculation of the frequency of items and itemsets that eventually influence the final set of qualified itemsets.

Suppose that the transactional item Ij appears in N transactions.  If the business rules are not considered, then the frequency for Ij is N.  But business rules cause each occurrence of item Ij to have a bargain level that may be different from one occurrence to the next.  If the bargain level for an occurrence of Ij is zero, it means that the  purchase of this specific occurrence of Ij is not encouraged by any of the business rules.  As a result, a weighted frequency is used to determine the frequency of the Ij.  The weight frequency is defined as: WFj = (1-Bj1) + (1-B j2) + ... + (1- B jn) (1) Formula (1) immediately above is only applicable for calculation of the frequency for 1-itemsets.  The weighted frequency for a k-itemset is influenced by bargain levels of k constituents and transactional items of Ia, . . ., Ib where k = (b ? a) +1.  In this case the weighted frequency is defined by formula (2).

WFj = (1-Bj1) + (1-B j2) + ... + (1- B jn),    (2) where, Bji = (Baji + ... +B b ji)/ k Table 2:The five business rules and their discount    Table 2:The five business rules and their discount levels (L).

# Business Rules Discount level (L) 1 Only one business rule may be used toward the purchase of an item.

2 Buy one of item I1 and get one item of I4 free for the time units of t1 and t2.

0.95 3 Buy item I5 and get discount of 50 ? on items I12, I20 and I10 for the time units of t4, t5, and t6.

0.35 5 Items (I2, I4, and I10) are on sale for the time unit of t4 (80 ? per item.) only for senior citizens.

0.2 The participation of any item (or itemset) in formation of a new itemset demands that the weighted frequency for item (or itemset) be greater than or equal to the support- frequency.

Experiments and Results The goal of this experiment is to determine the effects of business rules on the number and the contents of association rules.  The association rules and their numbers are the direct byproduct of the itemsets.  Therefore, the analysis evaluates the number and the contents of itemsets in the presence of several different business rules.

Table 2 presents the five business rules chosen.  A dataset was then created with each record representing a transaction made by a customer and reflect the presence of business rules.  The transactions extend for ten units of time (t1, ..., t10).  The transaction record for a given unit of time is generated using the following algorithm.  An explanation of the algorithm follows its presentation.

Algorithm SYNTHETIC Given:A set of business rules along with their discount levels.  Each rule may have (a) zero, one or more  than one source items, (b) one or more than one affiliated items, and (c) one or more than one time units.  A pool of 20 transactional items.

Objective:Create synthetic data for the transactional activities of an enterprise using the business rules.

Step 1. Repeat step 1 for every time unit ti: A. Find a business rule (ri) that is applicable during time unit of ti.  Identify the source item and affiliated items for the rule.  Add the source and the affiliated items names E times to the pool of items.  By doing so, the chance increases of the appearance of a source item and an affiliated item in the same transaction record.  This mimics the purchasing enthusiasm of the customer due to the offered bargain.  The E value is a function of the amount of discount (L) provided by the business rule and it is defined in Table 3.

B. Create N transactions, where the value of N is randomly chosen and it is 80 &lt; N &lt; 120. In each record the number of transactional items    each record the number of transactional items is up to 8.  The transactional items are randomly chosen from the pool.  There is no duplication of the same item in a given (ITCC?04) 0-7695-2108-8/04 $ 20.00 ? 2004 IEEE transaction record.  Each transactional item in this file has the initial bargain level of zero.

C. Remove the extra copies of the source and affiliated names from the pool of transactional items.

D. For those transactions in which both the source item and an affiliated item exist, set the bargain level of M percent of the total occurrences of the affiliated item to the discount level of the rule ri.  The value of M is randomly chosen, but its range is limited by the amount of discount.

The range of M for different L values is shown in Table 3.

Step 2. End.

The behavior of the above algorithm for business rule 2 follows.  Before creating transaction records for the periods of t1 and t2, I1 and I4 are added three times (based on the value of E in Table 3) into the pool of transactional items.  The transactional item pool now has 26 items.

Upon the completion of creation of the records for the periods of t1 and t2, the extra copies of the items I1 and I4 are removed from the pool.

For those transactions in which both I1 and I4 exist, the bargain value of I4 changes to 0.95.  In reality some of the customers do not take advantage of the discount for I4.

Therefore, only M percent (where, 70 ? M &lt; 100 for the example in hand) of the bargain values of I4 are changed to 0.95 and the rest of them are untouched.

The file F0 is created ten times for the business rules of Table 2.  Since the values for N and M are randomly chosen, the ten files are not the same.

All ten copies of the file F0 are analyzed using Apriori algorithm for the support value of 0.2 and the average of results are shown in Table 4.  This process was repeated for the support values of 0.3 and 0.4 and the results are also illustrated in Table 4.

To observe the effects of the business rules, a new copy of every file F0 is created and the bargain level of all the items is changed to zero.  All ten copies of the new file (F1) are analyzed using the Apriori algorithm for the support values of 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 and the average of results for each support value is shown in Tables 4.  As a part of the analysis of F0 and F1, the common items are determined among the corresponding itemsets.  The j- itemsets created for the first F0 and F1, for example, have a set of items in common, Gj = (j-itemsetF0) ? (j- itemsetF1).  The ratios of D = | Gj | / | j-itemsetF0| and E = | Gj | / | j-itemsetF1| determines the contents ?closeness? of j-itemsetF0 and j-itemsetF1 together.

The results of the analyses reported in Table 4 deals with a mixture of discount values.  Another experiment    with a mixture of discount values.  Another experiment was conducted that assumed  all the business rules initially have the same discount level of 0.05 and in ten iterations, the discount level reaches 0.95 (incremented by 0.1 per iteration).  For every iteration, the entire process is repeated to obtain results from the files with a mixture of discount levels.  The changes for support value of 0.4 and for different discount levels (L) are shown in Table 5.

Conclusions and Future Research For the synthetic data generated by this research, the results illustrated in Tables 4 and 5 reveal the following.

x ? The effect of business rules are not observed for the support values less than 0.4.

x ? The bargain level of less than or equal to 0.15 does not have a significant effect on the associate rules using the threshold support value of 0.4.

x ? The contents of itemsets change faster the number of itemsets.

x ? The number of itemsets is not a function of the discount level.

x ? The association rules and their number are different for each support value.

x ? The relationship between the changes in bargain level and their effects on the number of itemsets is not linear.  When the bargain level goes up, the number of the itemsets goes down.   The declining rate is accelerated by increase in the support value.

The research team is in the process of studying the effects of the business rules on large datasets.  In addition, the effects of business rules on multi-dimensional association analysis are also underway.
