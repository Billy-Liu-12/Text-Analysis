I. INTRODUCTION  Data mining techniques can be used to discover useful patterns of classification for detecting the protein sequence with similar pattern. In this paper patterns are extracted using novel priority based data mining algorithm. The priority is based in the similarity count (hit) which changes with the time series in different datasets, it depends on the item set similarity with the searched protein sequence as input. Once the hit counts are recorded for similar protein sequence patterns are extracted from the datasets.  The algorithm is again applied in reverse that is extracting the non-existing protein sequence from the datasets using improved K- means clustering.  In the proposed system protein sequence pattern is given as an input to be searched from the existing dataset, which is taken from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) using the NCBI (National Center for Bio- Technology Information) tool. Existing System algorithms do not work based on priority while searching the protein sequence.  This may lead to wrong prediction and the knowledge discovery accuracy level is less.  This paper overcomes this limitation with the novel algorithm.

II PROBLEM DESCRIPTION   A.  Review of priority based data mining Algorithm  Over the past years the number of known protein structures has been increasing relatively in the fast pace    [8]. The study of structure of protein related to its function is unknown.  Structural similarity between proteins allows studying the evolutionary relationship between remotely homologous proteins. The priority based data mining is process of extracting similar data, which is the protein sequence from the huge Protein Data Bank (PDB)[6] using the concept of multiprocessing.

The clustering of the protein sequence is explored using the improved k-means algorithm [7].The analysis helps in function prediction.

B. The proposed Data mining technique is as follows  Given a protein sequence as an input that has to be searched in the given Dataset D={D1,D2,?.Dm},D1 contains N protein sequences S1,S2? S n varying lengths L1,L2?Ln each of the sequence can be represented as Si={ail?ail?.aiLi},   a il  ? ?  ,  i=1,2..N,  l=1,2..Li and  ? is set of alphabets that has a position in a sequence that can be pattern recognized.

C. Importance of Protein Similarity  This Similarity search in protein sequence is one of the challenging problems in data mining arena [8]. A novel priority based Data mining algorithm for similar and dissimilar protein sequence is two way checking the positive and negative perceptive of the protein sequence .

The protein sequence search is based on priority based Data mining algorithm which is as follows .

Input: Protein sequence (PM) which has to be searched in the Dataset D= {D1,D2,?.Dm} ,  Step 1:  Create streams for {D1,D2,?.Dm} ,Open all the streams P1, P2 .. Pm   using different threads (Daemons) Step 2:  Read the protein sequence (PM) that is to be searched.

Step 3 : Pattern matching that is PM occurrences in Di is recorded  as Count(n) if each dataset D1,D2,?.Dm}} which has count of  as n1,n2?nm,as the pattern extracted from  item set I=(item1,item2?..itemt ) .

Step 4:  Compare the count (n) that is sort n1, n2?nm in ascending order.

Corresponding to n1, n2?nm sorted order after the T1 time series.

Step 6: Repeat 3 to 5 for time series T2, T3? Tn. Until all item set are exhausted in the dataset.

Step 7:  Plot scatter graph (using statistical tools) and close all the streams Step 8:  Analysis of the Cartesian scatter graph which is generated using improved K-mean clustering technique.

Step 9: end  Output:- Prediction is made after the analysis to support the hypothesis which the user is looking for.

The Test set is as follows   a. Randomly choose 30% of the data to be in test set  b. The remainder is a training Test c. Perform the regression on the training set d. Estimate your future performance with the set   The same algorithm is repeated where pattern matching is not found which makes it multi way processing comparing positive and negatives of similarity and dissimilarity that could help in decision making that is prediction from the analysis of scatter graph. Improved K- means clustering is used to perform knowledge discovery.

K-means algorithm is a simple iterative method for a given data set into user specified number of cluster. One issue to resolve is how to quantify closet in the assignment step.  The default measure of closeness Euclidean distance in which case one readily show that the non negative cost function will decrease whenever there in change in the assignment or relocation step, hence convergence is guaranteed in finite number of iterations.

In this paper the protein sequence is being searched from the four data sets  Homosapiens, Mammals, Fishes and Birds above referred classification and clustering is performed. The application tool was developed in java using Netbean IDE. The Scatter plot was generated by processing the TABLE I and TABLE II using statistical tool based on the time series. Searching a sample protein sequence ?ALA? in a dataset.

D.  Problems in Traditional K-Means Clustering algorithm  K-means clustering is popular for large datasets with both numeric and categorical attributes [1][3]. For the traditional K-means clustering algorithm, K samples are chosen at random from the whole sample space to approximate centroids of initial clusters is needed to explore the knowledge of the K-means algorithm [2].

According to this paper it has a very small number of samples. But PDB has large number of sequence segments generated by our protein dataset. It is impractical to implement Random, Mac-Queen, and Kaufman as the initialization method for K-means clustering technique.

E.  Problems in New Greedy Initialization Method for the K-Means Algorithm  To overcome complex problem of random initialization, the new greedy initialization method tries finding a solution to choose suitable initial points but the draw back in the new initialization method is the clustering algorithm can only be performed after several iterations during each run [5]. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes the improved K-means Algorithm which is as follows  Step 1: Count the number of initial points and count the total number of Cluster Step 2: If the number of initial points discovered is less than the total number of clusters then step 3 else step 6 Step 3: Run the traditional K-means algorithm for a fixed number of iterations on the whole sample space Assess the structural similarity of clusters created by each initial point. If the structural similarity for one cluster is bigger than or equal to a given threshold then step 4 else step 5 Step 4: Check the minimum distance of the point creating this cluster with existing points in the initialization array If the minimum distance is bigger than threshold then this new point is included into the initialization array Step 5: go to step2 Step 6: end  TABLE I DISPLAYS THAT COUNT FOR THE GIVEN PERIOD OF TIME SERIES   Time/ Species Homosapiens Mammals Birds Fishes  T1 1 0 1 1  T2 1 0 3 1 T3 2 1 2 1  T4 0 0 1 0    TABLE II SHOWS THE PRIORITY BASED ON TIME SERIES VERSUS SPECIES   Time/ Species Homosapiens Mammals Birds Fishes  T1 6 6 6 6  T2 8 4 10 6 T3 8 4 10 6  T4 8 6 10 4          Numerical stability of the cluster algorithm is estimated by performing K-means clustering five times with different random starting points. Only recurrent clusters come into the analysis of results. To save the computation time, the structural similarity threshold is set as 65% for all the experiments.



III. RESULTS A. Dataset  In this paper it introduces an experimental parameter as the Data set and the method to search protein sequence that pattern matches with the existing data set which is obtained from Protein data Bank(PDB) using NCBI tool [7] ,the sample data sets are stored in text files.

Comparison of Performance for the Traditional and Improved K-Means Algorithm  In Table III, the average percentage of sequence segments belonging to clusters with high structural similarity for the traditional and improved K-means algorithm is given in Table IV. Further analysis indicates that most initial points that create these 40 clusters come from outliers of clusters. Outliers of clusters refer to  L        M  Distance =?  ?

Table IV shows the number of clusters exceeding given structural similarity thresholds for the traditional and improved K-means algorithm.



IV. DISCUSSION  In the classification of protein sequence segment from Protein Data Bank (PDB)[8] using the tool NCBI tool in the detection process, In this paper it applies the priority for searching from the different Data sets using a novel  priority based Data mining algorithm and using improved k-means clustering from dataset of frequent item set.  The priority is based on number of occurrence of protein sequence in the data set for the time series t1 , t2? tn.  The priority keeps on changing dynamically depending on the occurrence of the matching pattern.

Setting priority and directing the classification is the main objective of the paper.  It helps in faster selection of data to an accurate discovery of knowledge.  In future this method can be incorporated with other algorithms for better accurate results.  The improved K-means clustering algorithm is better suited for this type of protein sequence which is searched from the PDB using NCBI tool. Our results reveal much more detailed hydrophobicity patterns for helices, sheets, and coils than the previous study.



V. CONCLUSION  The proposed novel algorithm for Data mining can be incorporated with other algorithms for better prediction and accuracy. Main advantage in using priority to help classification and to search the protein sequence segments from the large Protein Data Bank (PDB) using NCBI tool. Analysis of protein sequence also shows the improved K-means algorithm may detect some very  subtle protein sequence overlooked by the traditional algorithm. The reasonable experimental results shows that improved K-means clustering technique is effective in classifying data with specified similar biological characteristics and in discovering the underlying relationship among the data samples. Since the K-means algorithm is a very powerful tool for data mining problems, the improved K-means algorithm may be useful for other important bioinformatics applications.
