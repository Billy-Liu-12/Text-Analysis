Introduction to the Predictive Analytics and Big Data Mini-track

abstracts simplified by laymen to be classified in two dimensions, i.e. correctness and readability. With regard to three performance measures, accuracy, f-  score, and AUC, this study reveals that support vector machines-based model outperforms multi- layer perceptron and kNN models. Authors are critically stating that before putting this classifier into practice it would be appropriate to further optimize the SVM model.

In the third paper, Hagenau et al. propose a text mining-based stock price prediction. The study achieves this by employing various aggregation time intervals in terms of weeks and it uses various datasets (e.g. Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Adhoc- Publizitat and Reuters) to validate the approach. The findings reveal that trading strategies would be profitable if news momentum of the past weeks is used. News can be used for both short- and medium- term investments based on the satisfactory accuracy levels received at around 70%. The researchers of this study reported that their study was limited to company specific news and therefore needs to be enhanced to incorporate economic news and news from other countries.
