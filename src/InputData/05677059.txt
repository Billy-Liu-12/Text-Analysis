Association Rules Applied to Credit Evaluation

Abstract?Farmers are the main financing of rural financial markets, in rural financial institution, lending is based on the credit status of the farmers, so the evaluation of their credit level is always the focus of the theory field and the practical field. A reasonable credit evaluation index system is the prerequisite for scientific credit evaluation. In this study, association rules technology which is the core methods of data mining was applied to mine credit database, and the weight of each index and the score of each attribute value could be accurately calculated by the results of correlation analysis. Through this way, the establishment of credit evaluation index system was more scientific, objective and reasonable.

Key words-small credit loan;  association rules;  index system

I. INTRODUCTION The small credit loans is a kind of popular credit form for  making aid accessible to individual farmer, and it is very popular all over the world now. Such credit is a loan target poor peasant, based on the credibility of farmers without any mortgage and guarantees within the approved amount of money and period of time. Currently, the small credit loan plays a constructive role in expanding the rural financial channels, and supporting the economic restructuring in rural areas. It is a correct way to promote the development of the rural economic. Peasants can have great improvement in family property, employment opportunities, income levels and social status after they get the small credit loan. But, with small credit loan carrying out extensively in wide range of rural areas, financial risks of financial institutions in rural areas were gradually emerging, and non-performing loan ratio continued to improve. Therefore, it was an important, urgent task to establish a scientific evaluation model, which was used to make better and faster decision, reduce the evaluation costs, and strengthen the ability of risk control for the rural financial institutions. But the reasonable credit evaluation index system is the premise of the scientific credit evaluation model. In previous studies, the weights of the index were decided through hierarchical analysis process, which is a way of sorting out and integrating the expert?s experience, and also an effective way to quantify and concentrate the different advices [1]. But in this method, the weights of traditional credit index depend on the expert?s experience, which is too subjective, and the weight of the same index should be different in the different areas or should be different in different social economy situation. The collection, archiving and electronization of rural farmers credit  information had achieved in a wide range of China, and the content and quality of the data are also more standardized and improving day by day. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to mine the farmers? credit history to find out the degree of the influence of the different indicators with the association rules technology. This method provided a new scientific and reasonable quantitative method which was used to caculate the weights of the credit indexes, and then it could help the expert to make decision scientifically and effectively.



II. SUMMARIZE OF THE ASSOCIATION RULES Data mining, also known as knowledge discovery in  databases, means extracting people?s interested knowledge from the databases or the data warehouse. This kind of knowledge is implicit, unknown in advance and potentially useful information. The extracted knowledge can be expressed as concepts, rules, laws, models and other forms. In other words, this kind of knowledge is to summarize data in the form that the owner can understand and in the form that is valuable for him [2]. The essential difference between the data mining and the traditional data analysis is that the data mining mines the information and discovers knowledge without any explicit assumptions. The information which is obtained by the data mining should have three characteristics: unpredictable, effective and practical. Data mining is widely applied in finance, insurance, telecommunications, supermarkets and other fields which have accumulated large amounts of data, such as credit evaluation, risk analysis, fraud examination, the cluster analysis of the user and the analysis of consumer habits [3-6].

The association analysis is the core method of data mining, and it is used to discover the meaningful correlation between the item sets from the large amounts of data, find out the interesting association between the given items. The support and confidence of the association rules are two measures of rule interestness, and they respectively reflect the usefulness and certainty of rules. The specific definition is as follows [7]:  Let I={i1,i2,?,in} be a set of items, let D, the task-relevant data, be a set of database transactions where each transaction T is a set of items such that T ? I. each transaction is associated with an identifier, called TID. Let A be a set of items.

Transaction T is said to contain A if and only if A ? T. an association rule is an implication of the form A=>B, where  Supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grant No. 2009JC006  *Corresponding author.

The rule A=>B holds in the transaction set D with support s, where s is the percentage of transactions in D that contain A?B(i.e., the union of sets A and B, or say, both A and B). This is taken to be the probability, P(A?B). the rule A=>B has confidence c in the transaction set D, where c is the percentage of transactions in D containing A that also containing B. This is taken to be the conditional probability, P(B|A). That is,  Support(A=>B) = P(A?B) (1)  Confidence(A=>B) = P(B|A) (2)  Rules that satisfy both a minimum support threshold and a minimum confidence threshold are called strong. By convention, we write support and confidence values so as to occur between 0% and 100%, rather than 0 to 1.0.

The minimum support and minimum are commonly specified by users in accordance with current mining goal. The former describes the minimum importance of association rules, and the latter expresses the lowest reliability.



III. APPLICATION OF ASSOCIATION RULES In general, the whole process of data mining can be divided  into three main stages: data preparation, data mining, expression and interpretation of results.

A. Data preparation phase Data processed in data mining are often messy, repeatable  and incomplete. So a complete data mining must consist of data processing. Taking the discovery task as the goal and field knowledge as the guide, data preprocessing use completely new bussiness to organize the original business data and discard attributes irrellant to mining goal in order to provide data mining algorithms with clean, accurate, and more targeted data. The advantage of the preprocess is decreasing data count, improve mining efficiency, and improve the satrting point of konwledge discovery and the accuracy of knowledge [8]. The process of data preparation is: Firstly, accept and understand user?s discovery requirement, and then determin discovery task.Secondly, extract knowledge source relevant to discovery task. Thirdly, perform validity check on data according to restrictive rules in background knowledge.After the following data cleaning and data normalization, the target data can be generated for mining task.

Data preparation takes up the largest proportion during the whole process of data mining,usually around 60%. The preparaton process can be further diveded into three sub-steps: data selection, data preprocess and data transformation.

1) Data selection The credit database provided by some rural credit  cooperative institution contain very complete information, covering information about individual and his family, information about household assets and liabilities, and  inromation about historical credit. But not every attribute is needed for data ming. So, the primary work is discarding attributes irrelavant to mining task, such as household?s name, ID number, spouse name, home address, phone numer and so on.

2) Data preprocessing There are many kinds of method to fill vacancies for the  property value.

? Ignore tuple: use this method when a tuple has several property value missing;  ? Fill missing value by hand: in general, the method is very time-consuming, specially when the data set is very large and many values are missing, this method may not work;  ? Use the average value to fill the vacant value;  ? Use average value of all samples in the same class as the given tuple;  ? Use the regression method, Bayesian method or decision tree method to decide the value to fill the vacancies.

The current rural credit cooperatives had already complete electric credit file for most farmers. However, when credit cooperatives collect, process and store data, it is inevitable that part of property values are vacant, or deviated from the fact.

Therefore, in order to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of evaluation model, preprocessing work must be performed. In this study, we use different preprocess methods in different situation.

There are three types of credit information collected in credit database: personal and family basic information,family asset and liabilities information, and historical credit information. Historical credit information is the most critical part in farmers?credit database, and it also has greatest impact influence on the evalution results. So the above method one was used to delete the records whose historical credit information was missing. The method four was used to remove the records whose household assets and liabilities are vacant.

For records whose individual and family basic information part is absent, we used the default value determined by experience to fill vacancies. For example, use ?man? to fill vacancies when the value of household sex is vacant. Use ?traditional planting and breeding? to fill vacancies existing the attribute value of current occupation. The method two was used to deal with the records which had only few vancant value.

3) Data transformationa Data transformation operations ofter include integration,  discrete and concept hierarchy [9].

In this study, three types of transformation was performed according to the mine needs.

? Convert string type data to digital type data. For instance, in the attribute value of sex, the value of ?man? was changed to 1, and ?woman? was changed to 0. In the attribute value of current occupation, the values of 1, 2 and 3 were respectively applied to        substitute for ?traditional planting and breeding industry?, ?family processing industry? and ?commerce?.  The values of 1, 2 and 3 were respectively used to substitute the value of ?return the loan in tine?, ?return part of loan on due? and ?return none on due?.

? Discretization. For example, age has numeric and continuous values which are not suitable for association analysis. So the dicretization operation was performed on this property. The age value was divided in to [18, 30], [31, 35], [36, 49], [50, 60] of four groups. The value less than 18 or more than 60 were taken as dirty data and the corresponding records would be removed from database. In another example, the area value of arable land, forest, or fish pond could be divided into [0, 5], [6, 10], [10, 50] of three groups.

Therefore, we used ratio transformation method to divide the whole into several non-crossing zone according to the area of attribute value, and to substitute numbers for the attribute value of each zone.

At last, historical credit information was transformed to the standard form of transcation database.

B. Data mining phrase In this phase, the actual mining work should be performed.

The most critical task is to select an algorithm which have straitforward impact on the quality of mining pattern.

Apriori algorithm is a influential probability based algorithm which mines Boolean frequent itemsets for association rules [7].

? Set the minimum support and minimum confidence.

? Scan all the data in the database to calculate one- dimensional frequent itemsets  ? Use one-dimensional frequent itemsets to generate possible candidate itemsets for two-dimensional itemsets.

? Scan database again and count two-dimensional candidate itemsets. If the support of some candidate items are more than specified minimum support, this item is added into two-dimensional data itemsets.

? Repeat the process until all the data itemsets which satisfy the condition are enumerated.

In this study, the mining task of historical credit transactions was to calculate the support and confidence of association rule X=>Y(the consequent Y is returning all the loan on due,and the antecedent X is the attribute value of each indicator.Therefore, after using Apriori algorithm, a task must be done on finding all association rules with the consequent Y and the corresponding support and confidence.

C. Results presentation and interpretation stage In this stage, the minng result may be presented in the form  which user can understand. In our study, the result of assocaion analysis list had another use that calculate the weight of every  indicator. All the assocation rules under the same indicators and their confidence sorted by conficence. A example list is as follows:  TABLE I.  CONFIDENCES OF DIFFERENT AGE VALUES TO RETURING THE LOAN ON DUNE  X confidence(%, Ci)  [18,30] 46  [31,35] 63  [36,49] 75  [50,60] 41    If the score of age indicatior is five, the score of each age phrase can be calculated as:  Score(i) =5*Ci/?Ci  (3)  And then the standard deviation of confidence in the same indicator is taken as this indicator?s importance to whether can return the entire loan on due.

TABLE II.  LIST OF THE VARIANCE OF CONFIDENCE IN EACH INDICATOR  Indicator Standard deviation of confidence (%)  Age 14  Years of education 16  Skills 8  Family?s total assets 25  Family?s total liabilities 26  Total family net income 25  Arable land area 20  Forest area 28  Pound area 24  The number of maintenance 27  Insurance 30  The loan of the past first year 16  The repayment of the first year 42  The loan of the past second year 18  The repayment of the past second year 37  The loan of the past third year 17  The repayment of the past third year 33  The loan of the past fourth year 18  The repayment of the past fouth year 43    Based on the above table, the weight of each indicator can be calculated using the following formula:        Weight(i)=Ci/?Ci   (4)  Through the above steps, the weight of each index and the score of each attribute value in transaction database can be accurately quantified.



IV. CONCLUSION During the implementation process of small farmer credit,  the farmer's credit rating has been a bottleneck. In this study, the association rules technology, the core methods of data mining, was applied to mine credit database, and the weight of each index and the score of each attribute value in transaction database could be quantified accurately. Through this way, the establishment of credit evaluation index system was more scientific, objective and fair.
