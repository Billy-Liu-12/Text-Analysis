Generating Implicit Association Rules from Textual Data

Abstract  The need of sophisticated analysis of textual data is be- coming very apparent. In the general context of knowledge discovery, Textmining techniques aim to discover additional information from hidden patterns in unstructured large tex- tual collection. Hence, in this papec we are interested espe- cially in the extraction of the associatiomJiom unstructured database. The objective of this paper is twofold. First, to propose a conceptual approach, based on the formal con- cept analysis [ I  I ] and a semantic pruning, in order to dis- cover explicit association rules, from large textual corpus.

Second, to introduce an algorithm to derive additional and implicit association rules, using an associated taxonomy, Ji.m the already discovered association rules.

1. Introduction  Nowadays, a lot of database systems are built for storing documents and textual data. Thus, it is necessary to pro- vide automatic tools for analyzing large texhial collections.

Accordingly, in analogy to datamining to structured data, textmining is defined for textual data [ 131.

In fact, we define textmining to be the science of extract- ing additional information fiom hidden patterns in unstruc- tured large textual collection [21]. It is all about extracting associations previously unknown fkom large text databases  In this paper, we are interested especially in the extrac- tion of the associations from textual database. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, to propose a conceptual ap- proach, based on the formal concept analysis .[ 1 11, and a semantic pnining, in order to discover explicit association rules, from large textual corpus. Second, to introduce an al- gorithm to derive additional and implicit association rules,  [5 ,  6 ,  798, 101.

The proposed approach, in this paper is based on the use of Galois connection [ 1 1,201. It operates in a top-down ap- proach by finding first the largeformal concepts. In order to be efficient, only one pass over the database is performed, once all the required information, have been recorded dur- ing this unique database pass. The proposed approach is developed in the following steps :  1. We extract explicit formal concepts : In this step, we introduce a semantic pruning, using the association de- gree of two linguistic concepts given in the taxonomy.

2. From explicit formal concepts, discovered in the pre- vious step and using an associated taxonomy, we propose an algorithm to extract implicit association rules. These rules represent additional and hidden knowledge about the documents corpus and the do- main. Hence, we can discover unsuspected associa- tions holding in texts.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In sec- tion 2, we present basic definitions related to textmining. In section 3, we present the basic formalism of mining asso- ciation rules in the context of textmining. Section 4 intro- duces formal concepts analysis and introduce the algorithm to discover formal concepts. In section 5, we present an al- gorithm for discovering implicit association rules fkom tex- tual data. An illustrative example is also given. Section 6 concludes this paper and points out some perspectives.

2. Basic definitions related to textmining  Many interesting works on textmining was reported in the literature [4, 7, 8, 9, 12, 17, 211. In this paper, we are interested, especially in the association extraction fiom, tex- tual database (the full text approach). Hence, we first intro- duce the basic definitions related to textmining.

0-7695-1165-1/01 $10.00 0 2001 IEEE 137    Figure 1. The linguistic concepts taxonomy  Definition 1 [21] A document collection is a set of docu- ments (texts) representing an application domain.

Definition 2 [4, 211 A linguistic concept is defined to be a meaningfiul word, phrase, acronym or name, that has been extractedfrom unstructured components of the text, includ- ing blocks of text, abstract, headings, paragraph,etc.

It is also defined as a linguistic term while each document refers to a set of concepts or terms.

Definition 3 [4] A taxonomy is a hierarchy of terms (lin- guistic concepts) representing the documents. Each node of the taxonomy corresponds to a linguistic concept. It is viewed as a graph structure, which represents the relation- ship between two linguistic concepts in a document collec- tion, as well as the weight of each relationship.

The taxonomy is necessary in textmining system in order to allow the system to focus on the relevant set of linguistic concepts in the knowledge discovery process.

Example 1 Semantic relationships between linguistic con- cepts are represented by the taxonomy [21], as depicted in figure 1. Each concept C, is a node and each relation- ship is a weighted edge. Single directional edges pointj-om generic to specific concepts, while bidirectional arrows ex- ist between similar sibling concepts. For every pair of con- cepts C, and c b ,  the relationship r(Ca, Cb) measures the association degree between the two linguistic concepts. In- formation retrieval techniques [19] are used to determine the association degree, based on the frequency of appear- ance of C, and c b  in the same document.

3. Basic formalism of mining association rules  The basic formalism of mining associations fiom text is similar to the one presented by Agrawal et a1 [2] in the context of datamining.

A textmining context is a triple I C  = (V ,7 ,R)  de- scribing a finite set V = (01, ..., Dm} of documents, a  finite set 7 ={Cl, ..., Cn} of terms or linguistic concepts, and a binary relation R (i.e., R 23 x 7).  Each couple (Di, C,) E R, means that the document Di E 23, is labeled with the linguistic concept C, E 7.

Let LI, & 7, be a set of k linguistic concepts. The support of Lk is the percentage of documents in V contain- ing all terms in LI,'. The itemset LI, is said to be large or frequent, if its support is greater than or equal to minsupp2.

An association rule is an implication among itemsets de- noted by R : L, * Lj,  where itemsets L,, L, s 7 are subsets of linguistics concepts and La n Lj = 0. The con- fidence of the rule R, is the conditional probability that a document contains L, , given that it contains La.

Hence, Coaf idence(R)  = support(L, U  All known algorithms [l, 2, 15, 18,22,23] for generat- ing association rules operate in two phases. Given a finite set 7 ={Cl, ..., Cn} of linguistic concepts and a collection of indexed documents V, the extraction of associations sat- isfying given minsupp and minconf is performed as follows  Lj)/su"t(La).

by first generating all fi-equent itemsets. The frequent set generation is the most computationally expensive step [16].

then by generating all the association rules, that can be derived fiom the produced large itemsets, and that satisfy mineon$  4. Discovering formal concepts  4.1. Formal concepts Analysis  In this section, we present some classical notions of data mining context, Galois connection, formal concepts and for- mal concept lattice[ 1 1,201.

Data mining 'context A data mining context is a triple 2, = (0 ,Z ,  R) describing a finite set 0 of objects, a finite set Z of database items and a binary relation R (i.e., R C 0 x Z). Each couple (0, i) E R, means that the object o E 0, has the item i E Z.

Galois connection [ll] ing context. For 0 & 0 and I C: Z, we define :  Let V = (0, Z, R) be a datamin-  f (0)  : P ( 0 )  + P ( I ) f(0) = (2 I vo, 0 E 0 =3 (0, i) E R}; h(1) : P(1)  -+ P ( 0 ) h ( I )  = (0 I v2,i E I =+ (0 , i )  E R }  'suppmt(Lk) = {Di E DlLk C Di )  '- 'minsupp and minconf are user-defined thresholds.

We can remark that 0 x f(0) is the biggest relation of the form 0 x X C R, and that h(I )  x I is the biggest relation of the form I x X C R [ 111. In other words, f computes the maximal range for a domain 0, and h com- putes the maximal domain for a range I .

The operators h of in 0 and f o h in Z 3,  are called Galois connection operators [ 1 11.

Properties related to Galois connection (f, h)  are given in [3].

Proposition 1 Let I1,12 E Z. Then h (I1 U 1 2 )  = h(I1) n h(I2) .PI  Formal concept Let C G I be a set of items. C is called a concept, if and only if it is equal to its closure, i.e., C = f o h(C). h(C) is called the domain of C.

4.2. Discovering large formal concepts  The pseudo-code for discovering large forme1 concepts , is given in Algorithm 1. Notation and parameters used in  this algorithm are summarized in table 1. In each iteration, the algorithm constructs a set of candidate formal concepts (CLFC), prunes this set with respect to minsupp, yielding a set of non-redundant large formal concepts. Finally, using this set, it computes the generators set, that will be used during next iteration.

CLFCk r Set of large candidate k-itemsets. Set of large k-itemsets Each element of these set has three fields: i) gen: the generator, ii) supp: the support and iii) clos: the closure (i.e., f o h(gen)) .

Hence, initially, CLFC1 is formed by the 1-itemsets.

Each iteration is composed of two phases:  1. The h c t i o n  Gen-concept is applied to each genera- tor in CLFCi, determining its support and its closure.

2. The set of the generators used in the next iteration, i.e., CLFCi+l, is computed by applying the h c t i o n Gen-next to LFCi.

The algorithm terminates when no more generators to  The pseudo-code of the functions Gen-concept and process, i.e., that CFCi, is empty.

5. Discovering implicit association rules from textual data  5.1. The Semantic pruning in the context of textmin- ing  The large formal concepts LFCi, discovered by the knowledge discovery algorithm, described in the previous section, represent, in the context of textmining.oniy poten- tial large itemsets, resulting after a syntactic pruning. In this paper, we associate to the knowledge discovery pro- cess, an additional operation performed using an associated taxonomy to the textmining domain, in order to extract only relevant itemsets of linguistic concepts. We mean by rele- vant itemsets, that to have a k-large-itemset containing k linguistic concepts, such that these concepts must form a hlly connected subgraph in the taxonomy. Hence, it is use- ful to exploit an additional information in textmining, such as the association degree between two linguistic concepts, given in an associated taxonomy. We can add a seman- tic knowledge to the final association rules set, which il- lustrates the strength of the semantic relationships between linguistic concepts, in a given rule.

Proposition 3 [I41 Given a taxonomy G, and a k-large- itemset L k  in the set LFC; we compute the association de- gree between the k linguistic concepts r(Cl, . . . , Ck) in Lk, by performing the minimum operator on the all association degrees r(C;, C;+l), for every pair of linguistic concepts C; and C;+l.

Example 2 The association degree r(C1 , C2, C3) of the subgraph, illustrated in figure 1, is computed as fol- lows: r(C1 , C2, C3) = min ( r(C1, C2),r(C2, C3)) = min (0.8,0.45) = 0.45.

In order to introduce a semantic pruning, we introduce the function Semgruning, which tests, for all Lk = {CI, C2, ..., C k }  E LFC, whether the large itemset Lk forms a fully connected subgraph, in the given taxonomy, and if its association degree is greater than or equal to a user-defined threshold 6.

According to the conceptual textmining approach, pre- sented in this paper, we propose the following definition :  Definition 4 Explicit Formal Concept: A formal concept Lk is said to be explicit, in the context of textmining, f i t  is included in LFC, and it is not discarded ajier the semantic pruning step.

The pseudo-code of Semgruning function is given be- low.

5.2. Discovering implicit association rules  The problem of generating valid association rules, fiom the extracted explicit formal concepts, can be solved in a straightfonvard manner in main memory, once all large  itemsets and their support are known [16]. An adapted ver- sion of Apriori rule generation algorithm is given in [16].

The principle of this algorithm is described as follows : for every large itemset Li in LFC, all subsets Lj of L; are derived and the ratio4 s . l lpport(L;)5/~~pp~rt(L;  - Lj)  is computed. If the result is at least equal to minconx then the rule Lj ==+ (Li - Lj)  is generated. The valid rule genera- tion algorithm is detailed in [16].

Let us consider in the context of textmining:  1. LI, = { C1 , . . . , Ck}, a k-large-set of linguistic concepts included in ELFC.

2. E R S :  the explicit rules set, generated by the valid rule generation algorithm proposed in [16].

3. X ===+ Y ,  an explicit rule such that Xu Y = Lk = {Cl, ~ 2 1 " ' ,  Cn}.

4. X'  a subset of X ,  such that X '  = { ({ Cj} U X) - Ci} where {Cj}  are more specific linguistic concepts than C; in the taxonomy.

Hence, it is interesting to derive ii-om a rule X + Y, where X contains generic linguistic concepts, a valid rule X =+ Y such as the linguistic concepts in X '  are more specific than those in the large itemset X, according to the given taxonomy. In fact, we discover an implicit additional knowledge by exploiting the taxonomy, called implicit rules set ZRS, in the following way :  1. first, we must check for each concept C, in X ,  if it exists a subset {C,}, such that {C,} is a more specific linguistic concept than C,, and forms a fully connected subgraph with the subset { X - C,} in the taxonomy. If it is the case, we check whether r(C, , { X  - C,}) 2 8.

2. seFond, to conclude whether the implicit rule ZR: X -----r' Y ,  such that X = { ( {C j }  U X) - Ci} is a valid rule, we mus: compute its confidence, which is equal to support( X ) /support  ( Y )  .

3. If conJidence(XR: X '  ==+ Y )  is greater than or equal to minconJ then the rule ZR: X' =$ Y is considered as a valid rule, and it is added to ZRS.

The pseudo-code of Genjmplicit-rules function is given below.

Figure 2. Formal Concepts Discovery (minsupp=2)  5.3.2 Semantic pruning  Explicit formal concepts, discovered, in the previous step represent potential large itemsets. It should be noted, that in order to have a k-large-itemset containing k concepts, all the concepts in the large itemset must form a filly con- nected subgraph. According to the given taxonomy in figure 1, we assume that 6 is equal to 0.4. The result of the seman- tic pruning step, is the following large itemsets, which are filly connected subgraphs, and verify the minimal associa- tion degree :  2-large-itemset ={(CiC3, C4C8, C1C4, C1C7, C3C4,  3-large-itemset ={ C1C3C&1C3C7} We notice that the large itemset {C4C&} is discarded  fi-om the final output, since it is not a fully connected sub-  c3c7, c4c71  graph.

5.3.3 Implicit association rules discovery  Let us consider the large itemset Li = (C1C3C7) included in LFC and a minconf equal to 0.1 The valid association rules generated from Li, using the valid association rules generation algorithm, given in [ 161 are as follows :  I Explicit Rules (ER) 1 Confidence     I ER I Imolicitrules ZR I Confidence I  c7c3 ===+ c7 c4c3 3 c7 1 (Valid rule) I C,C6--.C7 I o I (Notvalid) I I C1C4+C7 I 1/4 1 (Valid rule)  ClC7*C3 I C4C7+C3 1 1/4 I (Validrule)  Notice that C3 and C, are similar sibl6g concepts in the taxonomy 4 and C, is more specific than Cl.

6. Conclusion and Future Work  Textmining is an emerging research area, whose goal is to discover additional information fiom hidden patterns in unstructured large textual collection. It is all about ex- tracting associations previously unknown fiom large text databases. In this paper, we have presented a conceptual approach, to discover knowledge, formally represented by association rules, fiom large textual corpus. Once, the dis- covered association rules were obtained, we proposed also an algorithm to derive additional and implicit association rules, using an associated taxonomy.

We shall consider, as a future work, fuzzy conceptual text mining approach, where textual data are represented by a fuzzy relation.
