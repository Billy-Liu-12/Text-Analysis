Abstract- Cross ambiguity function is a common method for joint estimation of TDOA/FDOA. CAF performance degrades in  wideband situation. The maximum likelihood estimator in  wideband model contains data resampling. Because of intensive  computational burden data resampling isn?t viewed as a practical  method. Calculation of short time CAFs and summation of them  is suggested as a practical alternative method. Different  summation methods were suggested for compensation of TDOA  variation in the integration time.

In this paper first with an experimental test we find the areas in  which FDOA variations is noticeable and we indicate that these  regions are big enough not to be ignored. Then a new method for  summation of sequential CAFs is presented. The proposed  method compensates variation of both TDOA and FDOA together  and via this method, detection ability of peak in combined CAF is  improved. The proposed method is based on Recti Linear  Constant Speed (RLSC) motion.



I. INTRODUCTION  Joint estimation of TDOA/FDOA has a variety of  applications in different areas such as Radar, Sonar, GPS,  Satellite communications. Calculation of Cross Ambiguity  Function (CAF), is the basis of joint estimation of  TDOA/FDOA, and in certain conditions, it is the Maximum  Likelihood (ML) estimator [1]. CAF is based on narrowband  model. Its performance degrades in wideband situations.

Wideband situations not only occur in extended bandwidth but  also occur in long observation time in which variation of  TDOA or FDOA considerable. [2] gives us further useful  information about narrowband and wideband signals and  models. In wideband models, ML estimator requires data  resampeling. In this conditions ML estimator is not practical  because it requires very high computational burden that make  it infeasible.

In order to have an optimum ambiguity function the following  condition must be satisfied:  1T   (1)  In (1), is signal bandwidth, T is observation time and is  target relative rate in respect to source rate and is computed as:  C  |||| || 21   (2)  In [3], Betz s  4.2T   (3)  Then two unacceptable picks were appeared in CAF. In [4], a  suboptimum algorithm is presented for baseband, which uses  the sum of short-time correlations. The procedure is to shift the  delay of the short-time correlations based on the hypothesized  time companding and then sum.

In [5], it was suggested three different algorithm for  summation of consecutive CAFs in the way that effects of  TDOA variations between them removed, but [5] omitted  effects of FDOA variations in the whole observation time.

Now the question is that if FDOA vary between CAFs how  should we sum consecutive CAFs and in this situation do the  previous algorithms performs perfectly and yield acceptable  results or not?

In this paper we answer to this question and propose a new  algorithm to consider the FDOA variations between  consecutive CAFS. In section 2 based on RLCS motion, a  model for FDOA variation is presented, then in section 3 a new  algorithm for summation of consecutive short time CAFS is  proposed. Section 4 contains experimental results and finally in  section 5 conclusions and future works are presented.



II. FDOA VARIATION BASED ON RLCS MOTION  Changes in distance between transmitter and receiver cause a  time companding. If signal?s bandwidth is appropriately small,  mentioned time companding is introduced as a frequency shift  in spectrum of received signal in respect to transmitted signal  which is also called Doppler or FDOA. Doppler is a function     Fig. 1.  A target with RLCS motion      of operation frequency and distance variations rate between  transmitter and receiver. In order to compute FDOA variations  in time, operation frequency is assumed constant and it is  assumed that we have a transmitter such as the one in Figure 1.

Target motion is supposed to be Recti Linear Constant Speed  (RLCS) which is the simplest motion model. This kind of  motion modeling is conventional in radar researches [6]. RLCS  model fits on many kinds of real motions.

Based on RLCS motion and figure 1 we have:  tv dt  dR cos      (3)  In (3) R is the distance between target and the receiver, || v is  the amplitude of target speed, and )(t  is the angle between  speed direction and the straight line between target and  receiver as a function of t . With RLCS assumption for motion, || v is constant, then  )(cos max  )( tdftdf         (4)  In (4) maxdf is the maximum Doppler that can be produced  with our operation frequency and velocity.

Equation (4) implies that the only term which is time variant,  is the angle between motion direction and the straight line  between transmitter and receiver )(t , and according to Fig 1  we have:  r  tvL  r  tL t  0)( )(cot    (5)  In (5), )(tL  is the distance between target and the closest  point to the receiver in the path (point A) at time t ,  0L  is the  distance between target and point A at  t=0 and r is the  distance between receiver and  point A. From (4) and (5) we  have:  ))  cot(cos( max  )( r  tvL arcdftdf . (6)  FDOA variation in time domain for varying r  and constant  maxd f  is illustrated in Fig 2. An experimental test was  carried out, to evaluate the areas where FDOA variation in one  second is noticeable. In this test we assume a target which has  RLCS motion. Results of our experimental test, with parallel  directions and varying r , are indicated in Figure 3 and Figure 4.



III.  MODIFIED MAGNITUDE SUMMATION (MMS)  METHOD  In section 2 we not only obtained the FDOA?s variations as a  function of time, based on RLCS motion but also it was shown  that these variations in most of the cases are not neglectable. In  this section we propose an algorithm for summation of short-  Time CAF?s in which instead of compensating TDOA  variations alone, it compensates FDOA and TDOA variations  between CFA?s together. In our proposed algorithm we  modified Magnitude Summation algorithm which was  presented in [6]. In order to compensate the joint variation of  TDOA/FDOA, at first we must know the variation trend of  TDOA and FDOA together. To determine the trend of  variations we need to know the path of motion and the  velocity. Having the case of linear motion with circular     Fig 3 ? Division of radar coverage area by rate of FDOA variation  Target speed: 200 m/s  FDOA variation in 1 sec greater than 4% FDOA variation in 1 sec between 1% & 4% FDOA variation less than 1% out of range     Fig. 2.  FDOA variation with time       Figure 4 ? Division of radar coverage area by rate of FDOA variation  Target speed: 320 m/s  FDOA variation in 1 sec greater than 4% FDOA variation in 1 sec between 1% & 4% FDOA variation less than 1% out of range      symmetry the  distance of the points from the receiver and the  amplitude of velocity will be sufficient. In CAF we only have  one point?s distance from receiver and the velocity, so we need  additional information to determine the trajectory of target, or  adding up a hypothesis for the second point?s distance to the  CAF assumptions. In proposed algorithm we use the  information included in the Direction Of Arrival (DOA), which  is another parameter that is usually calculated in radar systems.

For further information on DOA refer to [7].

By using the information on DOA the trajectory of target will  be determined. Then we can compensate the variation of  TDOA and FDOA during the whole observation time. In this  paper we assume that we have DOA for each short time CAF.

Hence we have an M element vector, named , that contains  DOAs for the whole observation time. Additionally we assume  that  has neither noise nor error and has ideal accuracy. It is  obvious that these assumptions aren?t practical but they aren?t  far from reality because by big arrays and super resolution  algorithms high accuracy for DOA is achievable.

By knowing  the whole angular transition of target is  obtained from (7):  M1   (7)  Now target motion must be limited in angle [Fig5]. For  hypothesis about initial distance and velocity we have:  ) )sin(  arccos( R  Tv (8)  In (8) v  is the hypothetical velocity R is the hypothetical  initial distance between target and receiver T is the hole observation time and is the angle between hypothetical  motion direction and the straight direction which has the  minimum length )sin(R [Fig4].

So radial velocity in the thk  CAF for  equals:  1( ) cos( ) 9  radial kv k v  (9)  The sign of  depends on the target moving away from or  towards to the receiver. And the distance between receiver and  target in each time step is obtained (10) which is a recessive  equation.

( ) ( 1) ( 1)  1 tan  radial  T R k R k v k  M  R initial dis ce    (10)  This recessive equation will complete with initial value which  is our initial assumption.

Now we create tow vectors containing the radial velocity and  the distance between target and receiver for each short time  CAF. If the vector named R is divided by source speed   it results which is also named delay or TDOA (11).

c  R (11)  This conversion can also apply to radialv  and by multiplying  radialv  to another constant it results in which is also called  Doppler or FDOA (12).

c  f radialv  0     (12)  In (12) 0f  is the operation frequency and c  is the source  speed. By means of these two vectors we present the Modified  Magnitude Summation (MMS) algorithm.

( , ) ( , ) M  combined k k kCAF CAF  (13)  (13) Indicates that for known , ( , )combinedCAF  is the  sum of consecutive short-time CAFs in a way that compensates  the variation of TDOA and FDOA in whole observation time.

The MMS algorithm when 0  -the case when the target moves directly towards to or away from the source- reduces to  the magnitude summation algorithm presented in [6]. It is  because when  tends to zero then the vector  is a  constant vector. Hence, considering (9) radialv becomes  constant too, that is the assumption of magnitude summation  algorithm in [6]. But when  does not tend to zero -colored  areas in figures [3] and [4]- the MMS algorithm is more  effective than the magnitude summation algorithm.



IV. SIMULATION  A numeric experiment has been studied to compare the  performance of pervious work with MMS algorithm. In this  numeric test we assumed:     Fig. 5.  target motion in angle      kmr  smv  MHzf  5.3  /320     The test was carried out for different initial distance values  kmR 4,5,6 And the total observation time was assumed  1 second. These three points are located in different areas  which indicated in Fig [4]. The results are given in figures [5],  [6], and [7].  As figures[6-8] show the performance of MMS  algorithm in respect of magnitude summation algorithm  depends on  location of the target. In the purple areas in  Fig[3,4] MMS algorithm derived very better  results as show in  Fig[6] which magnitude summation yields to double picks but  MMS algorithm not.



V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS  In this paper we proposed a new method for summation of  consecutive short time CAFs. The sensible property of this  method is the ability to compensate both TDOA/FDOA  variations in observation time. This ability acquires more  processing gain due to longer integration time and higher  performance of summation. It was shown that this algorithm  gives better results than the magnitude summation algorithm  especially in the case that the variation of DOA  in our system  is considerable, which happens when the target is around its  closest point to the receiver (the purple areas in figures [3] and  [4])  For further studies it is suggested to consider the effects of  errors in the DOA in the performance of the algorithm.
