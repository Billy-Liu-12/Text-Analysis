URBAN HEAT ISLAND EFFECT IN PRESERVED ZONES OF HISTORY AND CULTURE IN  OLD CITY OF BEIJING, CHINA

ABSTRACT  Urban heat island (UHI) refers to the phenomenon of the higher atmospheric temperature in the central urban area than the surrounding rural area, which makes the urban like a warmer island compared with the rural area. The vector data of 25 preserved zones and second ring road were overlain to the land surface temperature image. The UHI intensity in each zone and the old city is the difference between the averaged land surface temperature and the rural land surface temperature. Our results showed that the averaged urban heat island intensity in the preserved zones of history and culture was lower than that of the old city.

But the UHI intensity in some zones such as Dongbolichang, Dashilan, and Dongluguxiang were very big. Because there were high density of buildings in these zone. The smallest UHI intensity is in the Huangcheng zone which might be resulted from the large areas of water body and green land.

INTRODUCTION  UHI phenomenon was commonly referred to as temperature differences between cities and their surrounding rural rigons, with higher air temperatures in densely built cities and lower temperatures in surrounding rural regions (Landsberg, 1981)[1]. The underlying surfaces have been changed from vegetation to roads, buildings and other impervious surface in urban areas with the population growth and economic expansion, especially for some developing countries. UHI effect has been on of the increasing concentrations of urban problems among many tremendous environmental issues associated with human activities. UHI makes the originally warmer urban area hotter and hotter, especially in summer, so that there are more continuous days with high temperatures [2]. Consequently, some natural disasters, urban diseases and epidemics were caused by continuous high temperature [3]. UHI also makes the polluted materials can not be diffused easily, so that the urban environment was polluted heavily [4]. All of that are very bad for the urban ecology and residential environment. So monitoring  of UHI and the consequent strategies for controlling the development of UHI is very important for the local government.

Previously, measurement of UHI in air temperature was mainly conducted with the data acquired from the weather stations or automobile transects. Recently, measurement of UHI in surface temperature has been used as an alternative on larger scales by using airborne or satellite remote sensing techniques (Streutker, 2003)[5]. Price (1979) utilized Heat Capacity Mapping Mission (HCMM) data to assess the range and intensity of urban surface heating in the northeastern United States. Gallo et al. (1993) [6] evaluated normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), radiant surface temperature, and minimum air temperatures for each of 37 cities and their respective nearby rural regions. The satellite derived NDVI data, sampled over urban and rural regions composed of a variety of land surface environments, were linearly related to the difference in observed urban and rural minimum temperatures. Based on a heat-balance model using satellite and ground meteorological data, Soushi and Yasushi (2005)[7] developed a new method to separate the anthropogenically discharged heat and natural heat radiation from the sensible heat flux using the ASTER and the Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data. Their results showed that during the winter, anthropogenic heat accounted for almost all of the sensible heat flux in urban areas. The contribution of anthropogenic heat to sensible heat flux in spring was lower than the contributions in summer and winter. The anthropogenic heat flux was high in industrial areas throughout the year. Soushi and Yasushi (2007) [8] propose the use of storage heat flux to represent the heat flux between the land surface and the inside of the canopy for the heat balance analysis in Nagoya, Japan using Terra ASTER data and meteorological data.

Their analysis indicated that urban surface stores heat during the daytime and discharges it at night. Extremely large negative storage heat flux occurred primarily in the industrial areas for both daytime and nighttime as a result of the enormous energy consumption by factories. Yuan and Bauer (2007)[9] compares the NDVI and percent impervious surface as indicators of surface urban heat island effects in Landsat imagery by investigating the relationships between the land surface temperature (LST), percent     impervious surface area, and the NDVI. Their research suggests that percent impervious surface provides a complementary metric to the traditionally applied NDVI for analyzing LST quantitatively over the seasons for surface urban heat island studies using thermal infrared remote sensing in an urbanized environment. Tiangco et al.

(2008)[10] quantified the night-time UHI effect in Metro Manila and showed that the highest UHI intensity was 2.96?C, which was occurred in the central part of the city.

2. STUDY AREA AND DATA  2.1. Study area  Beijing, the capital city of China, is a worldwide famous ancient city with a long history and brilliant culture. It is located in the northern edge of the Northern China Plain. It is surrounded by Yanshan and Taihang Mountains in the Western and Northern area, and it?s eastern and southern area is sea and plain respectively. Up to now, it has a total area of more than 16 800 square kilometers, and consists of 18 districts. For preserving typical areas representing the ancient Chinese culture in old city which mainly refers to the areas enclosed by the second ring road, Beijing government enclosed 25 preserved zones of history and culture.

2.2. Data and processing  1 ASTER image on 31 August, 2004 was collected to perform our urban heat island effect analysis, because it is in summer when the urban heat island intensity is very higher. Thus, the result can reflect the real heat status in the preserved zones. The ASTER is the only high spectral resolution multiscpectral scanning system on the first platform on NASA?s Earth Observation System. It has three visible and near infrared bands with 15m spatial resolution and six short infrared bands with 30m spatial resolution and five thermal bands with 90m spatial resolution. The primary scientific objective of the ASTER mission is to improve understanding of the local-scale and regional-scale processes occurring on or near the earth?s surface and lower atmosphere.

Land surface temperature must be determined before monitoring the urban heat island effect, and some pre- processing procedures should be performed before land surface temperature retrieval. It is no necessary for the ASTER data to do geometric rectification because the ASTER level 1B data have performed the correction of the geometric distortions. And the atmospheric correction was made using software ENVI. For our study area is only part of one ASTER image, so image segment was conducted through overlaying the vector data of second ring road of Beijing. In order to calculate their surface temperatures and analyze the difference impact of different materials on UHI,  the main land cover types of the study area were classified on this image. Bands 1,2,3 of ASTER data were used to classify the land covers for they provide the highest spatial resolution and have been demonstrated to be useful for urban land cover classification (Zhu & Blumberg, 2002)[11].

Main component analysis was used to delineate some of the trivial information, then supervised classification were performed and 6 land cover types as water, mountain, buildings, roads, grass land and bare soil were identified   3. METHODOLOGY   3.1. Land surface temperature  The local split window method is one of the common ways to derive the land surface temperature. The philosophy of our iterative self-consistent approach for land surface temperature determination is based on the fact that the actual land surface temperatures are the same for all thermal bands (Becker and Li, 1991; Xue et al., 2005)[12][13]. For four thermal band data, we have    101, TT  M TT  PATs (1)  and    202,  TT M  TT PAT  s               (2) where T1 is the brightness temperature for 1st thermal infrared band, T2 is the brightness temperature for 2nd thermal infrared band, T3 is the brightness temperature for 3rd thermal infrared band and T4 is the brightness temperature for 4th thermal infrared band. A0 is a constant, P1, P2, M1 and M2 can be expressed as functions of emissivities ) in these four thermal infrared bands. Theoretically, Ts,1 is equal to Ts,2. Because of the effects of emissivity and atmosphere, the temperatures derived from equations 2 and 3 are different in practice.The detailed description of this method can be obtained from Xue et al.(2005)[13]   Figure 1.Study area and the selection of rural areas        3.2. UHI intensity  The land surface temperature difference between the urban and rural area can be used to identify of the UHI intensity.

In the procedure of the UHI intensity calculation, the selection of the rural land surface temperature is very important. For having a good representation of the rural area, a circular outside the fifth ring road was selected as the comparable rural area (Figure 1). Areas enclosed by red line is the old city, by blue line is the areas within the fifth ring road. The averaged land surface temperature of this circular area was regarded as the comparable temperature in the rural area.

4. RESULTS  Based on the method mentioned above, the land surface temperature and UHI intensity were derived in the old city.

During calculation of UHI, the comparable temperature in the rural areas is 302.069K. Temperature in the old city minus the temperature in the rural areas is the UHI intensity in the old city. Figure 2 is the UHI intensity in the old city.

The higher UHI intensity with values more than 3 degree areas was located in the Chongwen district, some parts of Xuanwu, Xicheng and Dongcheng district.  This might be caused by the higher density of resident buildings.  On the contrary, areas around waters and gardens have no UHI effect. This might be resulted from the relieving effects of the water body and vegetation covered areas on UHI.

Figure 2.Urban heat island intensity (unit: degree) in the old city     Figure 3.Urban heat island intensity (unit: degree) in the preserved areas    To better understanding the UHI intensity in the  preserved zones in old city, the vector data of the preserved zones were overlaid to the UHI intensity in Figure 3. there were severe UHI intensity in the Dongbolichang, Xibolichang, Dashilan, Fuchengmennei and Luoguxiang preserved zones. There was urban heat sink in the Huangcheng areas. All of this phenomenon might be helpful for the government to make some measurements to relieve the UHI intensity in the preserved zones.

5. CONCLUSION  Our results showed that the averaged urban heat island intensity in the preserved zones of history and culture was lower than that of the old city. But the UHI intensity in some zones such as Dongbolichang, Xibolichang, Dashilan, Fuchengmennei and Luoguxiang preserved zones were very severe  This might be caused by that  there were high density of buildings in these zone. The smallest UHI intensity is in the Huangcheng zone which might be resulted from the large areas of water body and green land. The UHI statuses in the preserved zones are helpful for the local government to take some measures to decrease the UHI effect in the preserved zones with a higher UHI intensity.
