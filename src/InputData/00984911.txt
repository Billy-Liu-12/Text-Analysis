Fast Data Association Algorithm for Passive Multisensors*

Abstract A data association algorithm for multiple passive sensors is presented in this paper. The algorithm is based on the intensity of space intersection made by measurements. Dividing the set of all possible targets into several subset, starting with the subset which has the best probability under the restraint of data association rule, the real target can be found quickly.

The numerical simulation with perfect detection probability and zero false alarm has been made, the result appears the algorithm has excellent performance on computation time.

Keyword: passive multisensors, algorithm, data association, sightline, intensity of intersection  I Introduction  In the multiple passive sensors data association problem, several bearings-only sensors observe one common surveillance area. With each detection of a sensor, the associated measurement is the sightline from the sensor to the target. The target position can be obtained by the bearing measurements from at least two sensors and should be the intersection of the sightlines[ 1,3]. However, the set of intersections include not only the targets but also a large number of ghosts which can't be delimited very well. As the increasing of the sensors and targets, the number of sightlines and intersections will increase exponentially.

The measurement-target association problem can be shown to be NP hard[2], even under the assumption of zero false alarm and perfect detection probabilities.

This paper concerns a fast algorithm based on the intensity of space intersection for multiple passive sensors. The intensity of a space position indicates the probability of which the position is a real target. The algorithm showed excellent performance in the case of 3 sensors[3]. The case of inultisensor up to 20 will be argued in the following.

2 Problem Formulation  For simplicity of presentation, we consider the static problem of associating measurements from multiple passive sensors and suppose the surveillance area is a planar region in front of all sensors and that the field of view of each sensor is 2n. There are m passive sensors numbered as s = 1,2,3, ... rn ; For the sensor s there are n, measurements at a given time,  they are numbered as i, = 0,1,2,...n, , where the value 0 means missed detection and is added to simplify the notation for incomplete measurement-target associations caused by missed detections. The number of measurements for each sensor may be unequal. In fact, a measurement is the sightline from the sensor to the possible target which results in the detection. A possible target position is the intersection of the  sightlines froin all rn, passive sensors, we denote it as Z,,,: ..., m ,  and note it rn -tuple of measurements. For example, when there are 4 passive sensors, position Z,,,, indicates that the position is the intersection of  the measurement (sightline) 3 from sensor 1, the  Supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China, No.69732010  0-7803-7000-7/0 1 /$lO.OO 0200 1 IEEE.

measurement 4 from sensor 3, and the measurement 2 from sensor 4, sensor 2 is a missed detection. The set of candidate position is the collection of all the possible target position:  The likelihood function of the m -tuple measurement  Zili being the set of measurements that originated  from the same target at location ( x j , y j )  is the mixed  probability density function[ I]:  s = 1  where, PD is the detection probability of sensor s ,  the probability function f( z , ~ ~ ,  Ix j ,  y ) = N (  6,  ) , 8,  indicate the direction of position (xj,yj) and the  sensor s ,  u(i ,)  is a delta function defined by:  I i 5 # 0 0 otherwise  , The target position can be u(i,) =  solved by maximizing the generalized likelihood ratio:  (3)  3 The algorithm based on the intensity of space ititersection  3.1 Conception of the intensity of space intersection  Although the association problem can be solved by means of maximization likelihood method, it is still difficult because the set of candidates is very large and the likelihood function can't indicate if the position is a real target. Even if the problem is solved, we still can't acquire the perfect result.

For data association quickly, we need to separate those intersections which has quite different probability of being a real target from the candidate set 2 .  We suppose that each sensor measurement belongs to a  target or a false alarm, each target belongs to a m - tuple measurement only, and that a real target can be detected by most of the sensors.

Firstly, in the set of candidates, if a space intersection has been detected by more sensors than other intersections have been, the probability of it being a real target is greater than that of other intersections.

We define the number of sensors which detected the intersection (possible target) as the intensity of the intersection[3]. The intensity of the intersection is equal to the number of sightlines across the intersection, it's  'range of value is from 0 to m . Based on the conception of the intensity of intersection, collecting the intersections that have the same intensity in one subset, we can get a partition for the candidate set Z :  z=z"'uz'"-' U...UZ'UZ' uzo (4)  where 2" is the set of all the intersection .whose intensity is m ,  and so on. An intersection in the set Zo is a missed detection for all the sensors, in other words, it is not exist, we can ignore all of them in the  set 2'. An intersection in the set Z' , is detected by only one sensor, we still ignore it because a real target should be detected by most of the sensors.

The set 2"' in the partition is very important because it is the starting point to solve the problem of association of the measurement and the target.

Suggesting there are 3 sensors and the probability of detection is 0.95 for all the sensors, then 85.7% of targets will be detected by all the sensors, it means that  85.7% of targets is in the set Z 3 .  Although the scale of the set 2 increases very fast as the increasing of the number of sensors and targets, those sets with strong  intensity, such as the set Z"' , Z"'-' , increase very slowly. We can give more weight to those sets in the process of association.

Secondly, the rule of data association makes some restraints to the measurement and the target.

Mathematically, it is a maximization problem by those     restraints to the set 2"' Za-' , ..., z 2 :  for the set Z"' :  ; indicates that the 1 if Zili ?... im E Z" 0 otherwize  where al:2,,.jn, =  maximize function is towards Z"' ,  . All of those restraint 1 0 otherwise  if TI; 2.../"# E Z'" p" . = + I )  ... lnr  rules mean each sensor measurement belongs to a target or a false alarm, each measurement belongs to one target only,  Finally, using the rule listed above, we can decrease the scale of each subset beginning with the  subset Z"' step by step. The possible target set Z"' , Zm-' ..., 2' will be changed into 2"' , z'"-', ..., z2 .  At last, the real target is the union of them:  3.2 Algorithm Outline and Analysis  We present a brief outline of the algorithm in the following:  Step I :  Initializing  Each sensor is numbered as s = 1,2,3, ..., m ; Each measurement of a sensor at a given time is numbered  asi, = 0,1,2 ,... , T Z ~ ;  Step 2: Obtaining the set ofpossible targets  Calculating the sightlines from each sensor, the  intersection Zjlj2 can be obtained respectively, the set of candidates is the collection of all of these intersections:  Z = { Z I l j  *,,, ;,,, ,i,v = 0,1,2 ,..., n, , s = L2 ... m} ;  Step 3: Partitioning of the set Z  Based on the intensity of space intersection and collecting all the intersection that have the same intensity into one subset, we can obtain a partition of  set Z:  z = z"' UZ"-' U...Uz2; Step 4: Checking the set Z" , reducing the scale  oftheset Z  Based on the restrain rule and the probability of each intersection in the set Z"' , the intensity of other intersections correlated will be degraded, the scale of  the set Z" and Z will be reduced respectively;  Step 5: Checking the set Z"-' till Z 2 ,  reducing the scale of the set Z  According the same rule above, the scale of the candidate set Z will be reduced continually;  Step 6: Final Results  The final results are the remains in all the subsets:  - Z =  To decrease the complexity oQpe algorithm and to speed up the process of the algorithm, a preprocessing can be used in advance. In a system whose sensors have perfect detect probability, a real target will be detected by more than m/2 sensors. If a intersection whose intensity is less than 50% in the process of association, it means that the intersection may be a false alarm and can be ignored. The threshold can be changed as the case may be. On the other hand, it is important to give a valid range where a real target will be in at the  ._  -  -     beginning of the algorithm. We need only to think about the intersection whose position is in fiont of all sensors because the suggested surveillance area is from 0 to 27r for all sensors. If the position of intersection is too far, the intersection will be ignored. It is reasonable in the dynamic case, for example, in the case of a real target far from all sensors, we can ignore it until it is in the surveillance area.

When we search for target in all subsets, the starting point is important because each intersection is dependent on one another. We should give a scan in the subset beforehand to find the intersection whose probability of being a real target is larger, and let it be the starting point. In general, the intersection that is by the side of the surveillance area is a better starting point.

In the process of data association, if we confirm that a intersection is a real target, the intensity of the intersection on the line across the real target will be decreased, the candidate set will be decreased corresponsively. At last, the remains in all subsets are the real targets.

I Illustration for  the scenario with 4 sensors  We illustrate the algorithm via a simple scenario with 4 sensors and 5 targets (see fig.1) and suggest that all sensors have perfect detect probability and zero false alarm.

We number the sensors as s = 1 - 4 by order and the sightline from each sensor as 1 - 5 clockwise. In the scenario, we have ignored all the intersections whose intensity is less than 2. There are 73 candidates in set Z ,  where there are 9 intersections whose intensity is 4, 6 intersections whose intensity is 3 and 58 intersections whose intensity is 2. To simplify the  presentation, we just illustrate the set Z4 .

By scanning all the intersections in the set Z4 from the left side, we find that the intersection Z,,,,  and Z,,,, have the same probability and their  probability is greater than other intersections. We use the intersection Z,,,, as the starting point. For a line  across 2, , , , which belongs to the sensor 2, there are only one intersection whose intensity is 4, it means the  probability which Z,,,, is a false alarm and at the  same time it can be detected by the sensor 2 is 0, we can confirm that the intersection Z,,, , is a real target, then the related intersection will be degraded in the set  Z ,  such as in the set Z4 , the measurement Z,,,, is  degraded to Z,,,, , the point Z,,,, is degraded to  Z4320 , it is illustrated in the row 2 of table 1.

We suppose that all sensors have perfect detect probability and zero false alarm and the surveillance area is in front of all sensors. The number of sensors is up to 20, and the number of target is up to 50, the computation time from calculating the coordinate of all intersections to the end of algorithm is listed in table 2. In the process of computing, most time is spent in the calculation of the coordinate of all intersection, less time is spent in the calculation of data association. Compared with other algorithm, the algorithm has excellent performance in the case of up to 20 sensors and up to 50 targets.

If the intensity of a intersection is more strong than those of others, it means that the probability of the space intersection being a real target is larger than that of others. According to the data association rule and the intensity of the intersection, we can get the result of the data association quickly. The numerical simulation has been made in the case of up to 20 sensors and 50 target, it appears that the algorithm may be have more potential in the real time system.
