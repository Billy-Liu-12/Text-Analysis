Good pervasive computing studies require laborious data labeling efforts: Our experience in activity  recognition and indoor positioning studies (Keynote Abstract)  Takuya Maekawa Osaka University, Japan  maekawa@ist.osaka-u.ac.jp  KEYNOTE ABSTRACT  Preparing and labeling sensing data are necessary when we develop state-of-the-art sensing devices or methods in our studies. Since developing and proposing new sensing devices or modalities are important in the pervasive computing and ubicomp research communities, we need to provide high qual- ity labeled data by making use of our limited time whenever we develop a new sensing device. In this keynote talk, we first introduce our recent studies on activity recognition and indoor positioning based on machine learning. Later, we discuss important aspects of producing labeled data and share our experiences gathered during our research activities.

SPEAKER?S BIOGRAPHY  Takuya Maekawa is an associate professor at the Osaka University. He is member of the Multimedia Data Engineering Group at the Graduate School of Information Science and Technology at the Osaka University. Prof. Maekawa received his Ph.D in Information Science at the Osaka University. In 2006 he worked at the Communication Science Fundamental Research Institute, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corpo- ration. In 2013 he was invited professor at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne.

Research focus of Prof. Maekawa is sensor data processing and analysis meant to estimate the behavior or location of hu- mans in a building by using data obtained from smartphones, wearable sensors or ubiquitous sensors. The applications of his research include monitoring single-elderly, indoor navigation or permanent record of life information.
