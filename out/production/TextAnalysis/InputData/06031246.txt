Association rules relating food tastes and Kikei roles based on Yakuzen theory

Abstract?Yakuzen theory is still regarded as a hypothesis. Many aspects of herbal treatments? effectiveness remain to be clarified.

Nevertheless, research results show that many rules have been advanced for foods? associated medical roles. Kikei, one promising hypothesis, holds that food taste will play a special medicinal role in different organs. This study, using data mining techniques, particularly addresses the relation between the food taste and Kikei role to extract the associated rules. Results of cluster analysis and chi-square tests show a therapeutic effect, which encourages our establishment of a systematic methodology related to food taste.

I. INTRODUCTION Particularly in recent years, as lifestyle diseases have  increased, health-conscious nutrition is recognized as important. Consciousness of food care and food support without nutritional guidance from a dietitian is growing in popularity. One method is Yakuzen food theory [1], a Chinese food medical theory based on ?food as medicine?.

Based on theories of traditional Chinese food medicine, Yakuzen has affected dietary treatment over China?s long culinary history. However, many such hypotheses of food dietary treatment remain to be verified. This study uses data mining techniques?? particularly addressing the relation between food taste and its Kikei role [2], a Chinese medicinal concept??to extract rules associating foods with their physiological effects. Using cluster analysis [3] and chi- square tests, we verified therapeutic effects to support our eventual aim of establishing a systematic methodology of food theory.



II. YAKUZEN THEORY Yakuzen theory, originally from China, was translated  into Japanese directly based on the theories of Chinese medicine ingredients. It is a food-based health care method based on food characteristics and a person?s health status.

Normal foods that have medicinal roles can be regarded as Yakuzen food. The importance for food, regarded as a medicinal material, is related to whether the food itself has the role of heating or cooling the body.

The roles which elicit body heat or cold, designated as the five characters (translated from Chinese into Japanese as Goki), include warm, hot, neutral, cool, and cold. According to the natural level of cooling, the food characters are  separable into cool and cold types; by the warming level, foods are classifiable into warm and hot types. Being neither warm nor cold implies a neutral character. For example, after eating ginger or hot pepper, a person?s body will feel hot, and perspiration is likely to appear. Warming foods are of two types: hot and warm, which make the body work actively, improve blood flow, and remove cold from the body to warm the body. Cooling character foods are of two types??cool and cold??which reduce body heat, hydrate the body, and eliminate poisons from the body. Neutral foods can balance body heat, making the body neither warm nor cool.

Another aspect of food is taste. According to Yakuzen theory, foods have five tastes, translated from Chinese into Japanese as Gomi. They are sweet, sour, bitter, hot, and salty.

Each taste has distinctive physiological effects. For example, bitterness can discharge extra components from the body; its drying role can discharge heat and water from the body, which is helpful for high fever and constipation. Sourness can produce muscle tightening, having the function of stopping perspiration or heavy urination. Therefore, sourness is effective for hyperhidrosis, urinary frequency, and involuntary ejaculation. Tastes have effective roles for human organs, named Kikei, which means that the food can be located selectively at one organ and can affect the organ.

In a body, there is a meridian system. The meridian system is a transmission course of energy and information. The meridian system reaches each internal organ. For a medicine or a food, Kikei means which meridian in particular internal organ it can reach and be effective. Table 1 presents the Kikei relation between tastes and affected organs.

III. ASSOCIATION RULE Association rules are popularly researched methods of  data mining for discovering interesting relations among elements in large databases. Piatetsky-Shapiro [4] describes analyses and precedent strong rules discovered in the database. Based on the concept of strong rules, association rules are used for discovering regularities between products in large scale transaction data recorded by supermarket POS systems. The rule ?{onions, potatoes}=>{ground beef}? found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, the customer is likely to also buy ground beef. Such information is useful as a basis for decisions about marketing activities such as promotional pricing or product placements. Here, the association rule will be used to verify the association between the Kikei character of Yakuzen to human organs.

To select the association rules, constraints on various measures of significance and interest are useful. The best- known constraints are minimum thresholds of support, confidence, and lift.

The support supp(X) of an item set X is defined as the proportion of transactions in the dataset which contain the item set. The confidence of a rule is:  conf(X=>Y)=supp(X Y)/supp(X)  For example, {Ginger}=>{Lung} has a confidence of 0.2/0.4=0.5 in the database, which means that it is applicable for 50% of the transactions under the condition. The lift of a rule is defined as  lift(X=>Y)=supp(X Y)/supp(Y)*supp(X).

The rule appearance ratio is low if the support is lower.

However, if the items are in numerous databases, then a high support degree of individual items cannot be expected. Rule evaluation must be considered comprehensively for support, confidence, and lift.



IV. EXTRACTION OF ASSOCIATION RULES FOR THE FOOD TASTE AND KIKEI ROLE  The study aims to clarify the association rules for food taste and Kikei medicinal effects. In the study, another taste, ?faint?, was regarded as important too, and will be regarded as the other five tastes.  From the reference of ?Chinese food treatment? [2], 138 food varieties are selected fir the food taste. The Kikei medicinal effects are shown in Table 2  TABLE 2  FOOD TASTE AND KIKEI MEDICAL EFFECTS  Wheat Sweet Heart Spleen Kidney Meat Sweet Heart Spleen Kidney  Ginger Hot Spleen Lung Pepper Hot Heart Spleen Bitter melon  Bitter Heart Spleen Stomach  Tomato Sour Liver Spleen Stomach Seaweed Salty Liver Spleen  Based on the apriori algorithm, we use the package rules installed in R language to extract the association rule between food taste and the Kikei role. Before calculation, the data of Table 2 are translated into a database format as in Table 3, in a transaction, 1 represents presence, and 0 denotes the absence of an item. The item frequency is depicted in Fig. 1  Fig. 1. Item frequency bar graph of taste and Kikei  Here we use the function of ?apriori? to extract the association rule between food taste and Kikei medical effects.

Parameters of the function include support, confidence, and the maximum length of the frequency item.

Food-taste-Kikei-rule<-apriori(foodtransaction, parameter=list(maxlen=2, support=0.01, confidence=0.01, ext =TRUE)) (1)  We can extract 158 rules based on formula (1) if the parameter adjusted as Support=0.04, confidence=0.05, extracted association rule is 89.

In the extracted association rule, the left side is antecedent, marked as lhs (left-hand-side). The right is consequent, marked as rhs (right-hand-side). The rule can be sorted based on support, or confidence, or lift. Fig 2 shows the subset of the associated rule, sorted by support and limited on 20.

Kikei-rule<-subset(Food-taste-kikei-rule, subset (lhs%in%?sweet?|lhs %in%?bitter?|lhs%in%?sour?|lhs%i  n%?hot?|lhs%in%?salty?)&(rhs%in%?stomach?|rhs%in%?lu ng?|rhs%i%?lung?|rhs%in%?lung?|rhs%in%?spleen?|rhs%in %?heart?|rhs%in%?liver?rhs%in%?small intestine?  |rhs%in%?large intestine?|rhs%in%?vesica?)) (2)  In fact, 35 rules can be extracted using formula (2). The extracted rules are presented in Table 4.

The extracted association rules were analyzed using the cluster method [5]. Here, from the extracted 35 kind of "Kikei-rule", using the R languages function of "dissimilarity", rules can be clustered by formula (3).

Kike-rule-cluster<-dissimilarity(Kikei-rule) (3)  Based on results of hierarchical cluster analysis, rules are divisible into six classes. Class 1 includes sweets associated with organs. Class 2 foods are bitter ones associated with organs. Class 3 includes sour foods associated with organs.

Class 4 foods are hot, associated with organs. Class 5 foods have a faint taste and are associated with organ. Class 6 includes salty foods associated with organs. A cluster graph is shown as Fig. 3 by using the plot function as formula (4).

V. ANALYSIS OF THE EXTRACTED ASSOCIATION RULES RELATED TO FOOD TASTE AND THE KIKEI ROLE  As a criterion of associated rules, only support and confidence evaluation are not always appropriate. To evaluate the extracted association rules properly, chi-square tests were performed in addition to the support and confidence.

The proposed associated rule is X=>Y. The support of X, Y, and X Y is marked as SX, SY, and SXY. The amount of transaction is proposed as M. In addition, the chi-square test [6] value of Tdep is calculated using formula (5):  Tdep =M(Sxy-Sx)2/SxSy(1-Sx)(1-Sy) (5)  If Tdep is small approaching 0, then the X and Y relation is independent. If Tdep is larger, then X and Y show a strong correlation.

Propose an established level of significance, if Tdep < 2( ), then X and Y are inferred to be independent. Here, based on  Table 5.

TABLE 5 CHI-SQUARE TEST RESULT  Associated item Chi-square test  value  Significance  Salty: kidney 17.655 Yes  Sour: liver 37.698 Yes  Bitter: heart 44.1424 Yes  Sweet: spleen 497.911 Yes  Hot: lung 3.324 No  Sweet: stomach 460.714 Yes  Faint: kidney 9.846 Yes  Based on chi-square test results, the associations between ?salty with kidney?, ?sweet with spleen?, ?sour with liver?, ?bitter with heart?, are inferred as significant, but the association between ?hot with lung? is not inferred as significant.



VI. CONCLUSION This study analyzed association rules linking food tastes  and affected organs. We verified the Kikei role of Yakuzen using data mining. The association rule between food taste and the Kikei role was extracted based on the support and confidence. A stronger association rule is shown between sweet and spleen, and sweet and stomach. The association rules are verified using the chi-square test. Aside from hot with lung, other association rules between tastes and organs show significance. This time, only 138 samples were used, perhaps explaining the lack of an association between hot and the lungs. The next step of research will involve collecting more food samples to verify the association rule.
