The Further Development of Weka Base on Positive and Negative Association Rules

Abstract?This paper introduced the features, functions, and mining process of the open-source data mining platform of Weka. In order to overcome the weakness of the aspects of association rules in Weka system research, we used positive and negative association rules algorithm to embed into the Weka platform, and expanded the association rules algorithm under the open-source environment for the futher development. We contrasted and analyzed the embedded algorithm with the original algorithm of association rules, taking full advantage of the functions of class and visualization in the open-source platform of Weka. This algorithm was made improvements in both extracting the explicit rules and fully mining the implicit rules. We carried out the experiment of public intelligence and information systems to obtain better results of association rules, and verified the good adaptability and scalability of the data mining platform of Weka based on the positive and negative association rules.

I. INTRODUCTION Data mining is to mine implicit, previously unknown,  and the potential value to the decision-making knowledge and rules from a vast amount of data. With the continuously expanding of data mining market, the study concerning with data mining is constantly penetrated. Data Mining is a applied science, and a practical technology from the very beginning, so it?s very important to select the appropriate data mining tools in intelligence analysis of data mining on account of its strong experimental.

The tools of data mining have been gradually from research to the practical application during the development of 10 more years. At present, the more influential and typical data mining tools of the world are some softwares of data mining such as: SAS's Enterprise Miner, IBM's Warehouse Studio, SPSS Clementine, etc. [1], but these commercial data mining tools are of higher prices and can not be re- developed. With the highest service awards in the field of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery won by Weka team of the University of Waikato, Weka system known as the milestone of data mining and machine learning in the history has been widely recognized. Now it is one of the most complete data mining tools, and has a very good application in the intelligent analysis.

Weka (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis) is an open-source data mining platform, which integrates a large number of machine learning algorithms to take on the  task of data mining, including data pre-processing, association rules, classification, clustering, regression and a wealth of available visualization capabilities [2]. Meanwhile, because of its open-source code, Weka can be used not only to complete the regular task of data mining, but also to make use of Weka framework for further development using the java language. In this paper, we exploringly used positive and negative association rules algorithm embedded into the Weka, expanded the system functions under the open-source platform, and contrasted with the performance of the original association rules algorithm of the platform.



II. WEKA INTRODUCTION  A. Weka and Its Functions The full name of Weak is Waikato Environment for  Knowledge Analysis, The package of Weka can be downloaded from the website of Waikato University in New Zealand (http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ ~ ml / weka /), the latest version number is 3.7.0.

As a public work platform of data mining, Weka includs 10 java packages such as associations, classifiers, core, filters, etc. The package of Core is the core of the Weka system, including some key categories such as Attribute, Instances, etc [3]. Weka has more than 1 million lines of codes in total. The two packages of Associations and Core are the main java packages to achieve the association rules algorithm, which contain 190 java source files.

Weka provides the following three main features: ? For the ordinary users who need analysis and  application of data, Weka provides a friendly interactive interface. Users can choose different algorithms to apply to the data sets needed analysis through the graphical interface. Then the system will intuitively show up the results of the analysis in different ways.

? For the researchers who study the theory and application of data mining, Weka provides open- source methods of learning and implementation, achieves an attribute pre-processing tool which is called filters as well. Users don?t need to focus on some details of data processing in the process of achieving their own algorithms, and just need to achieve their own algorithms without the realization of all comparison algorithms when compare the performance of a data set for processing among the different algorithms. In recent years, Weka has been   DOI 10.1109/ICICTA.2010.676     widely used as a standard platform to compare the performance among the different algorithms.

?  For the developers who program of data mining, Weka provides a framework just like the form of java class library to provide a simple programming interface for the secondary development on the Weka system. Developers simply provide an interface for development to write new algorithms, which greatly reduce the problems and raise its efficiency of the development.

B. The Comparison Between Weka and Other Open- source Data Mining Platform Recently, there are several popular open-source data  mining platform that have their own strengths and disadvantages as well:  ? RapidMiner, is used for statistical analysis and graphics-oriented computer language and analysis tools, but its mode of operation is different from commercial software?s. It does not support the way of analysis flow chart. It is not easy viewed when it contains relatively more operators.

? Tanagra, is adopted to organize the analysis of components by a similar Windows Explorer tree structure. It is short of advanced visualization capabilities, but its strength is the ability of statistical analysis, and it provides numerous test methods with parameters and non-parameters.

? Weka, is the well known open-source machine learning and data mining software. Advanced users can call its analysis component by Java programming and command-line. Compared with R, Weka is weak in statistical analysis, while it?s much stronger in machine learning.

? YALE, is built based on the Weka, it can call the various analytical components of Weka in other words.

? KNIME, is a well-developed data mining tool based on the Eclipse development environment. It don?t need to install and use easily, but does not support the Chinese language.

? Orange, is even simpler to use and the interface looks very cool, but its control ability is weaker than KNIME?s and does not support the Chinese.

? GGobi, can be used as plug-ins of R software, or can be called by Perl, Python and other scripting languages.

C. The Data Mining Process of Weka There are mainly five-step in the process of data mining  on the platform of Weka: 1)  Data entry  Data entry, there are three forms of data entry, including import file, download from the site, or import from the database. Weka can read many formats of files: Weka's ARFF format, CSV format, C4.5 format. The extension of ARFF file is usually. Arff, CSV file is. Csv, C4.5 file is.

Data and. Name, an instance of an object serialized is. Bsi.

2)  Data Mining Data Mining includes pre-processing, classification,  clustering, association rules, regression and other functions.

Pre-processing has the function of loading data, filling in the defect data items, filtering attributes, and filtering instances and other functions, which is the main part of the entire process of data mining.

3) Data evaluation Data evaluation assesses the model of the results of data  mining, studies the results of data mining.

4) Visualization  Visualization achieves visualization of data, mining process and results of data mining, provides a good assistant tool to the mining, and improves the efficiency of the excavation.

5) Storage Storage stores the results in a particular format after  excavation.



III. RE-DEVELOPMENT OF WEKA BASED ON POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE ASSOCIATION RULES  We can achieve a variety of algorithms cooperated well with each other through the data mining platform of Weka.

At the same time, because of the open-source code, Weka can be used not only to complete the regular task of data mining, but also used for the secondary development of data mining to fill in the gap of tools between common data mining and professional research in this field, which also makes the algorithms? implementation of the Weka are increasingly diversified. In this paper, we embedded the positive and negative association rules algorithm into Weka through an open-source platform, and expanded functions of the system.

A. The Thought of Positive and Negative Association Rules Algorithm Rules (AR: association rule) mining algorithm is only  used to discover association rules, that is, those with high frequency and strong explicit model-related[4], that is, like the A?B model. In fact there are still a number of database mining techniques used at present can not be found in hidden mode, that is, the form A??B,?A?B,?A??B mode of the three forms of association, these important model is the implicit negative correlation rules, it has a low frequency, strong nature of the relevant performance data between the itemsets not directly aware of the nature of the strong correlation, which tells us the rules of implicit data items which occur with less, but they have very strong correlation, including a very valuable information.

Compared to association rules, negative association rules of the affairs of the state of the project set to expand; it can not only tap the explicit relationship between attributes, but also be able to tap the explicit and implicit relationships between attributes.

The algorithm of positive and negative association rules is measured by one judgement and two indicators of the measure:  1) Decide the correlation according to the value of corrA,B=s(A ? B)/s(A)s(B),which is used to delete the     paradoxical association rules appeared in the process of mining.

There are three measurements possible of corrA, B[5]: ? If corrA, B>1, Then A and B are related; ? If corrA, B=1, Then A and B are independent of  each other; ? If corrA, B<1, Then A and B negative correlation; 2) Support and confidence is the positive and negative  association rules in two important indicators of the measure.

The support given by the user to meet the minimum support (minsupport) a collection of itemsets called frequent itemsets, association rules mining to find frequent itemsets is concentrating on the needs of the user to set the minimum confidence level (minconf) association rules.

Negative association rules contains itemset does not exist (non-existing-items, for example ?A, ?B), Direct calculation of their support and confidence level more difficult.

Theorem 1: if A, B?I, A?B=F, then ? supp(A)=1-supp(?A) ? supp(A??B)= supp(A)- supp(A?B) ? supp(?A?B) = supp(B)- supp(A?B) ? supp(?A??B) 1-supp(A) -supp(B)+ supp(A?B) Corollary 1: if A, B, T, A?B=F, then ? conf(A??B)=(supp(A)-supp(A?B))/ supp(A)=1-  conf(A?B) ? conf(?A?B) =(supp(B)-supp(A?B))/ (1-supp(A)) ? conf(?A ? ?B)=(1-supp(A)-supp(B)+supp(A ?  B))/(1- supp(A))=1- conf(?A?B) Corollary 1 used to calculate the negative inference  rules associated confidence level.

B. Positive and Negative Association Rules Algorithm We compiled the positive and negative association rules  algorithm (DoubleApriori) in accordance with the standard of Weka interface based on the above thoughts of positive and negative association rules algorithm. We chose Eclipes java platform as the further development environment of Weka.

1) Algorithm is as follows Input: L-frequent itemsets; minsupp-minimum  support Output: a set R of positive and negative association  rules; R = ?; / / Generate the positive and negative association  rules form frequent items For any itemset X in L do { For any itemset A?B=X and A?B=? do { corr=supp(A?B)/supp(A)supp(B) if corr>1 then{ if c(A?B)?minsupp then R=R?{ A?B}; } if c(?A??B)?minsupp then R=R?{?A??B};} if corr<1 then{ if c(A??B)?minsupp then R=R?{ A??B}; }  if c(?A?B)?minsupp then R=R?{?A?B}; }}} Return R;  2) Part of the procedure is as follows: / * Calculate support of the new generation of the negative  frequency, and add it into m_NCRules * / public void countItemSet() {int  necSupport;necSupport=(int)(m_minSupport*(double)m_insta nces.numInstances()+0.5);Enumeration enumItemSetsX=m_TemporaryNCRules[0].

elements(); Enumeration  enumItemSetsY=m_TemporaryNCRules[1].elements(); Enumeration  enumItemSetsXY=m_TemporaryNCRules[2].elements(); while(enumItemSetsX.hasMoreElements())  {AprioriItemSet x=(AprioriItemSet)enumItemSetsX.nextElement();  AprioriItemSet y=(AprioriItemSet)enumItemSetsY.nextElement();  AprioriItemSet xy=(AprioriItemSet)enumItemSetsXY.nextElement();  if(!containInNCRules(x,y)) { upDateCounter(xy,m_instances); if(xy.counter()<necSupport) {m_NCRules[0].addElement(x); m_NCRules[1].addElement(y); m_NCRules[2].addElement(xy); } } } }  C. Re-development process of Weka ? Put the source packages of Weka downloaded from  the official website into Eclipes java development environment.

? Establish the class of DoubleApriori under the package of weka.associations java since DoubleApriori is part of association rules algorithm, then directly copy the above source namely DoubleApriori.java to the class of DoubleApriori under the package of weka.Associations, which is shown in Figure 1.

? Amend weka.gui.GenericObjectEditor.props, then write ?weka.Associations.DoubleApriori? in the list of ?# Lists the Associations I want to choose from:?.

? Run Weka, link data, and new algorithm DoubleApriori added can be seen from the Associate window, which is shown in Figure 2.

IV. THE EXPERIMENT OF POLICE INTELLIGENCE AND INFORMATION ANALYSIS  We carried out an experiment of data source based on the information involved in the cases of police intelligence and information systems to verify the validity of algorithm and usefulness of Weka platform, which is shown in table I.

There are 200 experimental data transactions in total, and the number of the largest item set is 5. We set minsupp = 0.2 and minconf = 0.4.

Association rules can be drawn the following section through data mining, and will be compared with the general rules to find the number calculated of sets of rules between Apiori algorithm and positive and negative association rules algorithm, which is shown in table II. The number of positive association rules obtained from positive and negative association rules algorithm is significantly reduced in accordance with Apiori algorithm, which indicates some detect rules conflicting with each other are removed and a lot of negative association rules are mined at the same time.

The experiment illustrates the validity of the positive and negative association rules, and the availability of Weka platform.

V. CONCLUSIONS This paper mainly studies the data mining platform of  Weka and its re-development based on the positive and negative association rules. We used positive and negative association rules algorithm that meet the interface of Weka to embed into the Weka platform, as we can not directly mine the positive and negative association rules from the Weka platform. We carried out the experiment of public intelligence and information systems to obtain better results of association rules, and verified the good adaptability and scalability of data mining platform of Weka based on the positive and negative association rules. Positive and negative association rules algorithm improved the mining thoughts of traditional association rules, could solve the problem of falling into local optimum. The rules excavated by this algorithm shown in the experiment are a small number of high quality, non-false rules and conflicting rules.
