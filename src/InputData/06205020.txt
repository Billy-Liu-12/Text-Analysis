Abstract? Human Resource department (HR) plays vital and tedious role in recruiting manpower for organization and  forced to use more accurate talent evaluation applications for  selecting multi-talented personnel based on resumes, received  in huge quantity but most of the talent evaluation applications  are based on evaluating talent but not risk factors. This paper  presents the solution for selecting appropriate talented  personnel resumes without risk factors using association rule  mining (ARM) technique of data mining. The automated  intelligent agent based system (AIAS) built using knowledge-  based system for decision making process on logical rules and  facts obtained from domain expert and past learning  experiences using ARM technique which guides the HR  Department. The practical experimental results obtained from  AIAS encourage HR department to take prompt decisions for  recruiting talented personnel accurately without wasting  interviewers time of employer and employee. The proposed  system also reduces frequent resignations, improves  performance of talented personnel without training cost and  continuous monitoring.

I. INTRODUCTION  Recruiting multi-facet talented workforce in organization is a challenging task for HR department to place the organization at zenith in competitive market, for this HR department make use of excellent talent evaluation resume filtering tools [1]. Most of the tools are built using data mining techniques [3], [5]. HR department decision mostly depends on performance of job seeker in technical test, group discussions, written test and other skills. The talent evaluation can be achieved with the help of knowledge based and decision making systems but risk factor cannot be achieved [6].

In this paper we have discussed two important factors one is talent evaluation system at early stage is unacceptable and second is risk factors faced after recruiting talented people in the organization by HR department. The first thing is few talented personnel will be lost, if talent evaluation system applied at early stage and the other consequences are frequent resignations, training cost, continuous monitoring [2] which incurs unnecessary inconsistencies to HR department and obstruction for speedy development of organization in competitive market.

The proposed two tier system architecture of automated intelligent based agent system (AIAS) helps to evaluate talent and risk factors for achieving excellent accuracy in recruiting multi-facet talented personnel in the organization by HR department. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In section 2, we reviewed recent research advances in talent evaluation applications and their consequences [4] in perspective of risk factors involved [5]. The Section 3 describes operational phases of AIAS to validate talent and risk factors involved, then shortlist candidate resumes for recruiting talented personnel. The experimental results of our practical implementation is shown in section 4 including algorithmic steps. Finally section 5 summarizes entire paper and future challenges that can be done.



II. LITERATURE SURVEY  Recent studies reveal recruiting of talented personnel for suitable job and right personnel with appropriate skills to be justified [2] with the aid of talent evaluation tools. We surveyed some of the talent evaluation systems and their architectures that matched with our system architecture [6] resume talent evaluation system that filters unnecessary resumes and presents to the interviewer. HR talent evaluation system designed which show methods that emphasizes on recruiting process using web-based system by filtering resumes based on requirements of organization [1]. Most of the tools are built using data mining techniques [3]. The additional techniques for talent evaluation system other than data mining such as neural network, support vector machine, and statistical methods not particularly useful for HR department for decision making. Rough set theory to some extent using rules that show presence of uncertainty and vagueness, but accuracy of decision making reduced.

Recruiting talented people by HR Department in project oriented organization involves sentiments of the employees and employee adaptability in organization  [2]. Importantly performance management to improve skills of employees in the organization which is not easy to handle depends on psychological contract needs to be captured by HR department and avoid frequent resignations in the organization [4]. HRM based evaluation systems now-a-days integrated with CRM, BPR techniques but unable to handle risk factor which is very important to handle economic crisis  Identifying Association rules which is of interest among frequent and infrequent Items [7] from the database, patterns with low support often provide valuable new insights. Disk- based data structure built to evaluate patterns with high  Mohd Mahmood Ali Department of CSE  Muffakamjah College of Engineering & Technology  Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, INDIA  e-mail: mahmoodedu@gmail.com    Dr. Lakshmi Rajamani Department of CSE  University College of Engineering, Osmania University  Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, INDIA  e-mail: drlakshmiraja@gmail.com           support and low support among rare items [8], helped us to identify negative and positive association rules.

Finally our survey concludes that there is struggle in the market for searching best architectures and sophisticated resume processing tools to improve accuracy for evaluation of talent but not risk factors involved (to some extent).



III. COMPONENTS OF AUTOMATED INTELLIGENT BASED SYSTEM (AIAS)  The working of two-tier architecture of our proposed system with tightly coupled strategy is shown in figure 1.

The major components of the system architecture are:  ? Employee profiles database.

? Data preprocessing.

? Data Transformation.

? Pattern evaluation.

? Job posting rules.

? Domain expert and mined pattern(Historical data).

? Knowledge derived.

Figure 1.  Shows System Architecture of Automated Intelligent based Agent System.

A. Employee profiles database  The recruiter provides appropriate form requesting to enter the information for job seekers based on appropriate selection of type of job, qualification, experience and other relevant fields provided. The information given by job seekers will be stored in this database. The fields displayed in the form are mandatory to be entered for job seekers otherwise form will not be accepted.

B. Data preprocessing  Data entered in the form is sensitive and stored at different areas. Before applying mining technique ensure that data is in rich quality. If not the data has to be cleaned from inconsistencies, incompleteness and noisy data that may erupt unexpectedly in the database even after taking precautions.

1) Data selection Select relevant attributes from employee profile for  assisting the mining process.We have considered eight different attributes for talent evaluation and categorized them as Excellent, Good, Average, Poor based on which talented candidate performance is checked.

2) Data cleaning The other attributes like age, name, phone number, and  email-id are neglected which are of less importance for evaluation of talented personnel.

3) Data enrichment Employee Profile attributes are again categorized into  sub attributes into different types like Degree (B.Tech/B.E), PGDegree (MCA/M.Tech/MBA), Branch (ECE/CSE/CIVIL /IT/EEE), Experience (0-2/1/2-4/10/10+).

C. Data Transformation  The data used in data enrichment is modified into appropriate format using data reduction techniques. For example the average marks of two or more candidates are same like 79.56%, in such cases the higher level of comparison in done based on marks obtained in precedence subject and average is transformed to either 79% or 80%.

D. Pattern Evaluation  Patterns derived from employee profiles are stored using disk-based data structure to evaluate patterns with high support and low support count among rare items [8], which helped us to identify negative and positive association rules.

This technique is applied to Candidate profile database (CPDB) and later to New database (NDB) resulting to discover  both positive and negative association rules with skewed support based on risk factor refer figure 2. Finally new rules are derived to shortlist talented candidate resumes based on risk factor using domain expert and mined patterns (historical data) as explained later.

E. Domain expert and mined patterns  Historical data of the organization from which patterns are mined by applying association rule mining techniques [10][12] which satisfies minimum support and confidence pre-defined by recruiters for patterns then final association rules are framed.

F. Knowledge derived (Rules)  The patterns that are derived from employee profiles consists of both negative and positive association rules [7],[8], are evaluated by adding the existing patterns to historical data patterns and new patterns are derived by applying association rule mining technique [8]. Finally original rules are framed and updated in the domain expert database utilized for future use. The cycle follows as given in figure 1. in a top-down approach and updates if required.

G. Job posting rule  The recruiter post job rules based on requirement of the organization are given in table I.



IV.  IMPLEMENTATION OF AIAS & EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS  The accuracy of the automated intelligent agent based system (AIAS) computed using the formulae given below.

Tot. No. of resumes  Total No. of resumes      Accuracy =        Table I. Shows three rules has to be satisfied for consistency of AIAS talent  evaluation system in database.

RULE 1  EXCELLENT?  Branch(CSE/IT/ECE),College Affiliation(A,B,C), Certiication(IBM/ MICROSOFT/ SUN), Degree(B.Tech/ B.E), PGDegree(M.Tech/MCA/  MBA), Doctorate(phd/ phd pursuing),competitive_Exam (GATE/NET),  experience(5-10,10+).

GOOD ?  Branch(EEE/MECH/Civil/prod),CollegeAffiliation(A/B/C),certiication(  IBM/MICROSOFT/SUN),Degree(B.Tech/B.E), PGDegree(M.Tech/ MCA/MBA),Doctorate(phd/phdpursuing), competitive_Exam(GATE/  NET), Experience(2-4).

AVG?  Branch(CSE/IT/ECE/EEE),College Affiliation(A,B,C) certiication(No)  Degree(B.Tech/B.E),PGDegree(M.Tech/MCA/MBA),Doctorate(No), competitive_Exam(GATE/NET),experience(1).

POOR?  Branch(Civil/Prod),College Affiliation(A/B/C),certiication (No),  Degree(B.Tech/B.E), PGDegree(No),Doctorate(NO), Experience(0-2).

RULE 2  All the above rules with the help of knowledge database (historical  database) checked for risk management whether  the candidate if selected stay in the organization or not.

RULE 3  Apply association rule mining technique after augmenting (selected  candidate list to historical database) by creating shadow copy of historical database then find the frequent occurrences of candidate list  with respect to pre-defined support and confidence) and generate the final selected list of candidates.

The algorithmic steps shows working of the proposed system as follows given below refer figure 2.

1. Recruiter posted the pre-requisite and Internal Job rules (hidden) in the database.

2. Job Seeker provides information by selecting appropriate job from pool of jobs posted and  requirements given in the database by the  recruiters.

3. Push the profiles into Candidate profile database (CPDB).

4. Filtering involves redundancies, inconsistencies, incomplete, noisy and syntactical errors in profiles  (data cleaning process).

5. Derive both negative and positive association rules after applying apriori algorithm with automated or  user defined (variable support, depends on number  of records identified) confidence evaluated later.

6. Compare the rules derived with the constraint rules placed by recruiter.

7. Build the selected candidate list 8. Augment the CLDB to HDB (History Database)  Generate New database (NDB) Note: (updation if  required) to knowledge based database (historical  database).

9. Reapply association rule mining algorithm with automated pre/user-defined support and  confidence. (Perform comparison) generate new  rules, and avoids risk factor.

10. Generate the final list for selection of candidates (FCLSDB).

Figure 2. Shows the working of Automated Intelligent based Agent System (AIAS) for evaluating talented personnel.

Figure 3.  Display the form for job seekers to fill in the details.

Push profiles to Candidate  Profile Database (CPDB)    Posted Job (PJDB)  Database    Recruiter   Job Seeker    filter the profiles  (incomplete/ noisy) &  convert the DB in appropriate format    Apply (Apiori Algorithm) for processing  candidate profile data & derive (-ve/+ve)  rules (only frequent occurrences i.e support)  calculated.

Check derived rules  with the posted rules    Generate Candidate List for Selection(CLSDB)    Generate new Dbs by augument CLSDB to HDB    Re-Apply Apiori Algorithm to New  Dbs(NDB) derive (-ve/+ve) rules (both  frequent occurances i.e support & conf)  calculated.

Generate final Candidate List for Selection(FCLSDB)    KDB  Database  NO  (Ignore)  YES  1 2           Posted  Rules          The recruiter and job seeker time saved by filtering talented resumes at later stage instead of initial stage as shown in figure 2  of step 5, by finding negative and positive association rules [8]. Step 6 compares the rules derived with the constraint rules placed by recruiter. The risk factors involved after recruiting a person in organization is well thought-out by using domain expert?s knowledge (historical database) keeping in view of job posting rules for prompt decision making process in step 9. The practical implementation where job seeker fills up the form online and provides the complete information which is stored in the database for evaluating best resume is shown in figure 3.

The Use case diagram for talent evaluation system is shown below using rational rose which depicts the typical scenario of the automated intelligent based agent system (AIAS) shown in figure 4.

Figure 4.  Depicts the USE CASE diagram how the process interact in  Talent Evaluation System (AIAS).

Figure 5 display the average positive and negative  association of candidate profiles in relate to the job rules set  by the recruiter. Candidate profiles are processed and the  association of the candidates known based on support count  and confidence for the candidate resumes in pool. The  evaluation of the candidate is also done based on  qualification evaluation (substandard) and professional  evaluation (standard) which will be more helpful in  processing the right candidate without risk factor.

The figure 6 shows the evaluation results of the candidate  based on their qualification details. It evaluates the graduate, postgraduate, doctorate and marks percentage evaluation using positive and negative association rule [7], [8].

Evaluation results of the candidates based on their professional details shown in figure 7 for parameters experience, working area and certification/training using positive and negative association rule. The positive and negative association rules are very much useful for  evaluation of the candidate [7],[8]; the rules make the task easier for the recruiter for analyzing the best profile received.

The use of the association rules makes the project developed different from others as the efficient way for short listing of candidate resumes evaluation takes place here by use of negative and positive association rules without risk factor after analyzing the historical database.

Figure 5.  Average support and confidence based on pre-defined calculated by AIAS is shown.

Figure 6.  Shows candidate minimum support and confidence  results based on Qualification Evaluation.

Figure 7.  Shows candidate minimum support and confidence  results on professional evaluation based on experience, working area & certification.

The comparative table II shows output that number of resumes short listed after applying other talent evaluation system versus AIAS evaluation system represented in bold.

Table II. Shows three rules has to be satisfied for consistency of AIAS talent evaluation system in database.

Finally the outcomes are graphically represented using  columnar graph chart for total number of resumes, short listed resumes without risk factor(general evaluation), resumes from frequent and infrequent occurrences with risk factor, resumes from frequent occurrences where output of AIAS talent evaluation system are represented using an arrow marked above in figure 8.

V.  CHALLENGES AND FUTURE WORK  AIAS talent evaluation system developed helps HR department not only to take prompt decisions for recruiting talented personnel accurately without risk factor. Avoid wasting interviewer?s time of employer and employees but also, guides the HR department to manage organization talents for talented personnel recruited instead of keeping them on bench and continuous monitoring.

Issues and challenges yet to be done and incorporated in the Knowledge based database (historical database) are:    ? Background knowledge of talented personnel to be incorporated related to additional qualifications,  hobbies, interest.

? Social values and myths have to be identified without hurting his/her feelings in ethnic cultures.

? Relationship with colleagues and family.

? Periodic promotions and demotions.

? Skewed support based on higher qualification.

? Same resume re-applied for job in preceding years.

? Identify fraudulent resumes based on name, photo, email-id, phone number and other factors [14].

The automated intelligent agent based system (AIAS)  can also be used to understand psychology of talented personnel and predict their behavior if integrated with the above issues mentioned which finally helps and encourage low talented personnel in the organization for better management.
