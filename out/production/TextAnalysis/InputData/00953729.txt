Mining Association Algorithm with Improved Threshold Based on ROC Analysis

Abstract  The mining association algorithm is one of the most popular data mining algorithms to derive association rules at high speed from huge databases. We have been developing navigation sys- tems for semi-structured data like as Web data and bibliographic data. To navigate beginners, our systems give the association rules derived by the algorithm. However; the algorithm tends to derive those rules that contain noises such as stopwords then many systems use noise filters to remove such noises. In order to remove the noises automatically and derive more effective rules, we proposed an algorithm using the true positive rate and the false positive rate of derived rules in a database based on the ROC analysis. In this paper; we make corrections in the parameters to improve the extended mining association algorithm. Moreover; we evaluate the pe~ormance of our proposed algorithm using a experimental database and show how our proposed algorithm can derive eflective association rules. We also show that our proposed algorithms can remove stopwords automatically from raw data.

1. Introduction  In the research fields of data mining and text mining, various algorithms have been proposed to discover interesting patterns, rules, trends and representations in various databases. Many algo- rithms can derive just quite simple patterns or rules as knowledge, so it is very hard to derive meaningful rules or knowledge in the viewpoints of human experts. However, even these simple pat- terns or rules may be helpful for beginners who don?t have much background or domain knowledge of the interesting topics.

Focusing on the basic algorithm of association rules[l], we have been developing navigation systems for semi-structured data like as Web data and bibliography data. Our navigation system provides associative keywords with a query to users and provides helpful functions to beginners[4]. However, it is rather difficult for the administrator to determine system parameters, such as the minimum support threshold Minsup and the minimum confi- dence threshold Minconf, which are used in the mining associa- tion algorithm. Therefore, we proposed a method which evaluates the performance of derived rules based on the ROC (Receiver Op- erating Characteristic) analysis[2,6], and we became to be able to specifies the optimal thresholds[3].

We focused on the seman- tic relationship between the true positive rate and the false posi- tive rate based on the ROC analysis in a database, and imported the parameters into the algorithm as thresholds. As the results, our extended algorithm could remove the noises automatically and de- rive more effective rules [5].

In this paper, we make corrections in the parameters to im- prove the extended algorithms. Moreover we evaluate the perfor- mance of our improved algorithm using a experimental database and show how our proposed algorithm can derive effective asso- ciation rules. We also show that our proposed algorithms can re- move stopwords automatically from raw data. In Section 2 we summarize the mining association algorithm. In Section 3 we summarize the ROC analysis and the extended algorithms. In Section 4 we propose a improved mining association algorithm by making corrections in the parameters. In Section 5 we evalu- ate the performance of our algorithm based on the experimental results from INSPEC database. Finally, we make concluding re- marks in Section 6.

2. Mining Association Algorithm  The mining association algorithm well known as ?Apriori?[ 11 is one of the most popular data mining algorithms. The algorithm requires two parameters support and confidence to derive asso- ciation rules. Given a set of transactions, where each transaction is a set of items, an association rule is represented by an expression X Y, where X and Y are sets of items and X n Y = 8. The intuitive meaning of such a rule is that transactions in the database which contain the items in X tend to also contain the items in Y.

The support of the rule X + Y is the percentage of transactions that contain both X and Y, hence p ( X U  Y). And the confidence of the rule X + Y is the percentage of transactions that contain Y in transactions which contain X, hencep(Y I X).

Adapting this algorithm to a database which contains semi- structured data, we adjust keyword to item and adjust tuple to transaction in the database. And we adjust a set of keywords Q given in a query to X, a set of keywords IC derived from Q to Y.

And it is assumed that B is a set of tuples which contain &, U is the set of all tuples in the database and C is a set of tuples which  http://kudpckyoto-u.ac.jp http://i.kyoto-u.ac.jp   contain both Q and K in the database. Then the support and the con f itience of K are given by:  I C 1  I C 1 IUI 1131  SuppoTt(K) = -, confidence(K) = -. (1)  If X holds both support(K) not less than Minsup and con f idence(K:) not less than Mincon f, then K: is stored into a set of keyword sets R as an association rule enough to cause de- mands. Where Minsup is the minimum threshold of support to judge whether K: holds enough retrieval needs, and Mincon f is the minimum threshold of confidence to judge whether K holds enough confidence. Hence R = {XI, IC2, ..., Ki, ..., IC,}.

3. Extended Mining Association Algorithm  In the ROC analysis, it is assumed that a instance can be classi- fied into two instance classes of the positive P or the negative N, and positive y or negative n are assigned by a classifier. Then the true positive rate T P  and the false positive rate FP of a classifier are represented by  (2)  . (3)  Plotting F P  on the X axis and T P  on the Y axis on a graph for several instances, we can draw monotone curves, which is called as ROC graph. And the ROC curve near the area of higher T P and lower FP, that is the most upper left point, must be better.

In order to apply the ROC analysis on semi-structured data, it is assumed that R, is the set of tuples which contain ICi in the database and we defined the following: in a retrieval, the posi- tive instance is those 17 that decreases the number of contained tuples and the negative instance is those B that increases the num- ber of them. Thus the true positive instance can be defined as - 17 f l  U:=, R, and the false positive instance can be defined as Z? n LJY=l 7G , where U is the set operator of union and 1 1  is the set operator to count the number of items. Then T P  and F P  can be given by  positive correctly classified T P  = P(Y I P )  positives ,  F P  = p ( ~  I 2: totalnegatives negative incorrectly classified  And ROC curves can be illustrated by plots of points (FP, T P ) using different Minsup or Mincon f values as the classifier.

Focusing on TP' and FP' for each rule ICi, where they are provicled by the equations:  it is found that TP' is equivalent parameter to confidence used in the mining association algorithm, thus the rules must be plotted on the upper area of the threshold line T P  = Minconf on the ROC graph. While FP' is never used in the mining association algorithm, even though FP' is effective parameter in the ROC  i FPThreshold I I  0 0.5 1 False Positive rate  Figure 1. Association rules cutoff by F P' and ROC distance threshold  analysis. If some thresholds are given to make use of FP' in the mining association algorithm, it is thought that there is some pos- sibility of deriving more effective rules. Therefore we proposed two parameters for FP' as the thresholds[S].

One is a maximum threshold of FP'. A rule which holds higher value of FP' has stronger heterogeneousness and then it is rarely associative with the query even when the rule holds high value of TP'. Because those rules that appear frequently in the re- trieval space tend to become stopwords[7]. Hence the rules which hold value of FP' more than the maximum threshold MazFP should be removed as shown in Figure 1, and the algorithm based on FP' is summarized by the following steps: FP Algorithm  1. Derive rules by the mining association algorithm.

2. Select rules which hold values of FP' not more than  Another parameter is a minimum threshold of ROC distance, which is represented by dhoc in this paper. dk,, is the dis- tance between a point (FP',  TP ' )  and the point (1 ,O)  on the ROC graph, and given by:  d',,, = JTPI2 -I- (1.0 - FP')2. (6) Since d',,, can evaluate the performance of derived rules[3], the rule which holds the higher value of dkOc is expected to keep the higher performance. Hence the rules which hold value of d',,, less than the minimum threshold MinROC should be removed as shown in Figure 1, and the algorithm based on d',,, is sum- marized by the following steps:  ROC Algorithm  MaxFP from the rules.

2. Select rules which hold values of dk,, not less than MinROC from the rules.

Improved Mining Association Algorithm  Focusing on the semantic property of a position (FP?, TP?) on the ROC graph, a rule positioned nearer to the upper line T P  = 1 covers the same space as the query, for instance they may appear in an idiom. While a rule positioned nearer to the most right line F P  = 1 covers the different space from the query in the retrieval, for instance it may be used in a domain different from that of the query. Then it is needed to make corrections in the parameters in order to make the influence of them stronger.

Thus we make corrections in TP? and FP? for the ROC Algo- rithm as shown in Figure 2 by the following equations in order to make the influence of FP? stronger because FP? tends to become too small in a huge database.

ROC distance d& is calculated by the equation (6) using TP? and FP? instead of TP? and FP? respectively. And our Improved ROC Algorithm can be given by applying d?& on the ROC Algorithm instead of dk,,.

5. Performance Evaluation  In order to evaluate the performance of the Improved ROC Al- gorithm, we have used INSPEC database, which contains 33 1,504 bibliographic titles published by INSPEC in 1998, for many queries. In the database, keywords are represented by the regu- lar expression:  [a-zA-ZO-9]+  and all of uppercase letters are mapped into lowercase letters in the index searches so that case sensitivity is ignored.

Table 1 shows an example of association rules, which are associative keywords, derived from a keyword ?knowledge? and each column is sorted in order of TP?(cor1 f idence), 1/FP?, dkOc and dgoc.

As shown in Table 1, the original algorithm (FP?) tends to de- rive those meaningless words which are prepositions or have little semantic content, for example ?of?, ?for? and ?and?. Such word is called as stopword[7]. Since stopwords appear in many doc- uments, and are thus not helpful for retrieval, i t  is required that these terms are removed from the internal model of a document or query. Some systems have a predetermined list of stopwords.

SMART[7] system, which is one of the first and still best IR sys- tems available, has a list of 570 stopwords. However, stopwords could depend on context. For example the word ?system? would probably be a stopword in a collection of computer science journal articles, but not in a collection of articles from the Web.

Using the stopwords list, we would evaluate how our algo- rithms are effective to derive association rules. In Table I ,  key- words in italics are stopwords listed in SMART system, and it is found that all of our algorithms suppress to derive stopwords.

Hence if appropriate thresholds are given for our algorithms and lower ranked keywords are removed, stopwords will be removed automatically and the derived rules will contain little stopwords.

The difference between the ROC Algorithm and the Im- proved ROC Algorithm in Table 1 is only that the former de- rives ?network? which has (FP?, TP?) = (0.014236,0.019164), while the latter derives ?approach? which has (FP?,TP?) = (0.016906,0.060105). Generally speaking, if keywords hold about the same values of FP?, the keyword which holds larger value of TP? should be selected. Therefore the latter algorithm can derive more effective rules than the former algorithm.

In order to evaluate properties of the Improved ROC Algo- rithm, we examined results derived from sufficient number of queries which contain keywords appeared in attribute Title. We sampled randomly about 1% of keywords which appear not less than I O  times in Title except for stopwords and selected 197 key- words as queries. Minsup and Mincon f are given by  Minsup = 0.000001, Mincon f = 0.01, (8) But stopwords in the derived keywords are not removed and the derived keywords are just sorted in order for each parameter then  .

Figure 3 shows the average percentage of stopwords contained  in the derived keywords for each query, where each number of de- rived keywords is adjusted to the range of 100%. Although we know that the FP Algorithm and the ROC Algorithm always make the content by percentage of stopwords lower level than the orig- inal algorithm[5], the Improved ROC Algorithm makes it lower level in the higher rank than the other algorithms.

Figure 4 shows the average of ROC performance of the de- rived rules, where the ROC performance can be measured by the ROC distance[3]. And it is found that the curve drawn by the Improved ROC Algorithm dominates the curve drawn by the ROC Algorithm in all points even though the Improved ROC Algorithm does not use the parameter ROC distance. This means that the rules derived by the Improved ROC Algorithm share the area cov- ered by Q more effectively.

Moreover, Figure 5 shows the average of ROC performance of the derived rules after stopwords are removed. In this case, the curve drawn by the Improved ROC Algorithm dominates the curves drawn by all of the other algorithms then the Improved ROC Algorithm can always keep the highest ROC performance.

6. Conclusion  In this paper, we improved our previous extended mining as- sociation algorithm by making corrections in the true positive rate and the false positive rate based on the ROC analysis. And we evaluated the performance of our improved algorithm . As the results, our improved algorithm can remove noises such as stop- words automatically and keep higher performance than the other algorithms in the view point of the ROC analysis.
