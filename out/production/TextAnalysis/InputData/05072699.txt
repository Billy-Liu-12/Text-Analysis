I.  INTRODUCTION As there are many factors influence the converter steel-  making ingredients,and the smelting process is difficult to describe by a precise mathematical model, also the choose of smelting parameters largely depend on operator's experience and knowledge that greatly influence the stability of finished steel composition. It is difficult to fit the current demand of wide variety of steel smelting and shortened production cycle.

In this case, the steel plant developed the process rules for general processess according to its own condition, which could facilitate the parameters choosen for the operators. But these rules are discrete data that can only reflect part of the relationship between the process parameters and the effects, not combined relationship. The parameter list and curve can not meet the product requirements in a timely manner. Thus many scholars and engineers at home or abroad have done a substantial amount of research on the steel-making process, and achieved some results [1-4]. In this paper, a silicon, Si-Mn alloy weight neural networks (NN) model is established to solve the problems of alloy addition in smelting.The model can draw hidden knowledge that is difficult to describe by language from the production data, and automaticly select alloy accession volume. The data of smelting HRB400 steel is taken as calculation example for ditail discuss.



II. DECISION-MAKING PROCESS As many factors in converter steel-making process are  difficult to quantify, and it?s hard to obtain accurate real-time detection information, this determines the process can not adjust the volume continuous.Under the maturity of end point temperature control, the control of alloy addition is big problem that directly impact the quality, productivity and economic efficiency of steel. Alloy addition is the prediction amount of silicon alloys and Si-Mn alloys in a static model under determined blowing conditions and product composition, and according to the result to adjust the addition of raw materials in time. The accurate prediction of alloy addition before smelting plays a guiding role in decision-making, and effectively raises the hit rate of steel composition [5].



III. NEURAL NETWORKS MODEL Neural Networks (NN) technology is modelling method  that does not rely on strict mathematical model. Neural network model is a large-scale distributed parallel processing system with strong self-organizing, self-learning abilities and high degree of non-linear dynamics mapping function, suitable for those with high uncertainty or non-linear control object.The data are highly nonlinear in smelting process as there are many parameters, and the relationships between parameter itself and the effect are complex. It is difficult to establish a rigorous mathematical model to describe the laws of smelting process.

However, using actual production data to establish NN model for alloy addition can effectively solve the problem.

A. Modeling for Alloy Addition The model-building process for alloy addition including the  establishment of samples database, learning module, choosing technical parameters module etc.. Figure 1 is the flow chart for each module and their relationships.

1) sample database: In order for the model can be used in actual manufacturing, sample database is developed from production data collected in smelting of different types of steel.

Besides,with the smelting conditions change, the sample may not reflect the current state of production accurately, the database also need to redeveloped. So this is an open database, it can be continuously enriched, improved and stored in manufacturing in the future.

Supported by GuiZhou science and technology foundation project: [2008]                                  Figure 1.  Flow chart of NN model  2) expert knowledge acquisition module:  The learning of smelting is a process of obtaining structural parameters for the model that reflect the relationships of process parameters, product composition and alloy addition from technical data and smelting samples by expert knowledge acquisition module. The module is based on Levenberg - Marquardt optimization theory, reflect the non-linear relationships which are externalized by weight and threshold of neural network. Then the knowledge is modeled. This model of knowledge is not fixed, it can re-learning and obtaining corresponding model parameters with the condition changes or the content of knowledge updating in the process.

3) Process parameters selecting moduleor: According to confirmation of parameters that impact silicon and Si-Mn alloys addition in the actual process, the alloys parameters selecting module is established to calculate the actual amount.

The module has the ability to think as skilled operators and can simulate the decision-making process through expert knowledge acquisition module?s learning. Of course, the choice depends on the parameters selecting module, but the decision-making ability constrainted by knowledge acquisition module and process database. As a result, a comprehensive database of process and high-performance knowledge acquisition module are needed to support a good parameters selecting module.

B.  The Structure of NN Model There are many factors that affect the addition of  ferrosilicon and Si-Mn alloy, according to the survey and testing in the plant, also taking the converter smelting conditions and the actual needs into account, 16 main factors are determined, such as liquid iron, steel scrap, pig iron, Si-Mn and the composition of C, Si, Mn of end point etc..

Ferrosilicon, Si-Mn alloys selecting module is established by  using neural network technology with the topology structure 16-3-4-2, as it is shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2.  Structure of NN model  C. The Learning Algorithm The learning algorithm of neural network determines the  ease of knowledge acquisition and its performance. The conventional learning rule of BP network is Delta rule which is using the negative gradient value of error to adjust the threshold. that can adopt BP algorithm to compute[6].

Though BP neural network is the most widely used artificial method, there are still some flaws: (1) the convergence is too slow; (2) does not guarantee the global minimum point of convergence. We improved the BP algorithm to overcome its inherent defects, so as to enhance the speed and accuracy of the calculation.

when using gradient descent method, the error surface is narrow, this influences convergence rate and easy to gain minimum point partly[7-8]. In order to speed up the pace of training and avoid local minimum point, the role error gradient and the trends of the error surface are considered, we add the momentum item in the algorithm[9, 10], to smooth the dramatic changes in gradient direction when the network modified the weight value,  )()1( nXn jijji ????? ?+=+? Where: Xj -the input value from weights; ? - learning rate; ? - momentum factor(0 ~ l).From the formula we can see that once  jX?? =0, the value of weight still changed, which is equivalent to momentum multiplied by the changing of original weight. In other words, the vector of weight value continues to move along the direction of the last step, that avoid local minimum point.

In the gradient algorithm, the learning rate is a fixed constant, its value will have a direct impact on network training performance. If it is too large , it will reduce the stability of network, too small, it will lead to long training time. If the learning rate changes properly, it will speed up the training, and ensure the stability. The algorithm is that, firstly to calculate output error, and then calculate the weight and threshold value after training to gain the real time output error.

If the ratio of the output error and the previous one is greater than pre-defined parameters, reducing the learning rate. On the  Sample database Expert knowledge acquisition module  Nerve cell of knownleage  Process parameters selecting module  Process parameters selecting module  Smelting process  selecting  Alloy addition     other hand, increasing the learning rate until the ratio is smaller than pre-defined[9,10].

D. Pre-processing of Data There are two ways for data?s pre-processing.One is plus-  minus 1 normalization, the data is normalized in -1 to 1.The other one is equaling normalization, the data is normalnized into unit variance and zero in mean. As the data of metallurgical process is dispersed with large difference, a large number of training showed that both methods mentioned were slow in training and with large errors. In this paper, logarithmic transformation method is adopt, its formula is as follows:  a pnp  Ln k  pn jijiji ?  = 1  a tnt  Ln k  tn jijiji ?  = 1  Similar to normalization, the input data is logarithmic transformated and the output data is anti-transformated to resume data. The formula is:  i pnk  ji pmieap ji +?= ?  i tnk  ji tmieat ji +?= ?  where, jip - input data, jit -output data, jipn and jitn are transformed input data and transformed target data respectively,  ii pm and  ii tm  are input translation parameters  and target translation parameters. k is scale parameter, a is proportional parameter (a>0), usually k=1, a=1.
