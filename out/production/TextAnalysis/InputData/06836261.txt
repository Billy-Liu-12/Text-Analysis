Abstract? Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) Codes  offer remarkable error correction performance and  therefore increase the design space for communication  systems. When implementation complexity and latency  are not system limitations, LDPC codes can offer near  Shannon Limit performance by using large code lengths  and increasing the number of iterations in the decoding  process. Furthermore, LDPC codes with smaller block  sizes are also of value to the communications system  designer and LDPC codes have found practical use in  DVB-S2 and other standards.

This paper considers design issues with respect to FPGA  implementation of LDPC Decoders. Specifically, this  paper presents a scalable FPGA architecture for LDPC  soft decision decoding based on the Sum Product  Algorithm (SPA) for regular LDPC codes. The paper  begins with an overall discussion of issues surrounding  the use of LDPC codes, followed by a discussion of  LDPC decoding using the SPA. A scalable FPGA  implementation of an SPA LDPC Decoder is introduced.

Design data is provided to support FPGA  implementation of this approach for LDPC decoding and  quantify required hardware resources. A discussion of  trade space for LDPC code implementation based on the  FPGA resources is also provided. Finally, an example  design is provided based on a Xilinx Virtex-7 to illustrate  the concepts discussed in the paper and provide insight  into the challenging task of implementing an LDPC  decoder in FPGAs.
