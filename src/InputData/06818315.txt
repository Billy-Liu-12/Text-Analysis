April 4, 2014          ICDE Workshops 2014123    FOREWORD   Welcome to the International workshop on LOng term Preservation for big Scientific data (LOPS). It is the first meeting to be held in conjunction with ICDE that bring researchers from different domains to advance research in the area of long term for scientific data.

Scientific data collected with modern sensors or dedicated detectors exceed very often the perimeter of the initial scientific design in different application domains. These data including experiments and simulations are obtained more and more frequently with large material and human efforts.  For instance high energy physics and astrophysics experiments involve multi-annual developments. Hence, the preservation of big data sets produced is of permanent concern and has been addressed in various disciplines at different levels. However, the challenge of digital preservation of scientific data lies in the need to preserve not only the dataset itself but also the ability it has to deliver knowledge to future user community. A real scientific research asset allows future users to reanalyze the data within new contexts.

In fact, the data should be preserved long term such that the access and the re-use are made possible and lead to an enhancement of the initial investment. It is therefore of outmost importance to pursue coherent and vigorous approaches to preserve the scientific data at long term.

The overall goal of the workshop is to provide a forum for researchers to sharing original ideas, discussing and refining future research challenges in digital longevity of big scientific data in different application domains including biology, astrophysics.

The program committee accepted five papers that cover a variety of topics including data provenance, data quality, scientific workflow, representation of experiments and simulation, archiving, assessing, architecture and applications including biology and physics. We hope that these proceedings serve a start point for researchers and developers working on long term data preservation.

We would like to thank all authors for their contributions. A great thank, to the program committee members for spending time in reviewing papers and providing suggestions for improvements, and to Mehdi Bentounsi for helping in the organization. Finally, we would like to thank the CNRS for its sponsorship.

We wish you a great workshop and fruitful and productive conference.
