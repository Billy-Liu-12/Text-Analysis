The application characteristics of acupoints of acupuncture for tension-type  headache: an literature research based on Data-Mining Apriori algorithm

Abstract?Objective: Through data mining technology to summarize the application characteristics of acupoints in the treatment of tension-type headache with acupuncture in modern times. Methods: CNKI, VIP, Wanfang and PubMed databases as our retrieval source were used to collect literature about acupunture on tention-type headache, SPSS 18.0 software to establish data and IBM SPSS modeler 14.1 Data Mining Software to analysis. Then, Calculate the Support degree(S), confidence coefficient (C) and Lift(L) of acupoints itemsets to select the common acupoints as well as to summarize the law of choosing acupoints. Results: Participants included 27 qualified paper. From the point of the statistical results of association rules first, we found that the law of acupoints selection gave priority to points located in head Yang meridians, the most cited acupoints was GB20 (S 77.78%),and then the EX - HN5 (S 66.67%) and DU20 (S 51.85%). In additon, The Compatibility of three acupoints were also the most commonly. Support is 44.44%, the Confidence is 100%, the Lift is 1.5. the Gallbladder Meridian of foot-Shaoyang,the Stomach Meridian of Foot-yangming and the Governor meridian were the most common used meridian. Conclusion: According to the results of data mining, the law of choosing acupoints on tension-type headache mainly embodied in selecting acupoints located in head combined with distinguishing meridian. The results of apriori algorithm were agreed with the meridian theory of TCM and worth spreading and using in clinic.

I.  INTRODUCTION Headache disorders constitute one of the problems most  widely found in medical practice. Among all types of headache disorder, Tension-Type Headache (TTH) is the most frequent in adults[1]. Tension-type headaches incidence accounted for 42% of the primary headache in the world wide[2], and accounted for about 32.5% of the primary headache in our country[3]. Most people in the world have suffered from a tension-type headache (TTH) at some point in their lives.[4] The pain of TTH is typically pressing or tightening in quality, of mild to moderate intensity, and bilateral in location, and does not worsen with the routine physical activity. TTH is usually associated with psychiatric  comorbidities, seriously affected people?s life and work and bring about a series of problems.[5]  Acupuncture is the most widely practised of the non medicinal treatments for headache.[6] The researches of acupuncture on various types of headache have been carried out widely. Some results showed the acupuncture was an effective mean for the treatment of tension headache.[7-8] One research shows that many TTH patients seek acupuncture treatment in England: it has been estimated that, each week, 10% of general practitioners either refer patients to acupuncture or perform it themselves. In China, acupuncture treatment is widely used to cope with the TTH. Its therapeutic effect was reported in various types. Although the research on the effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of tension-type headache was a lot, the law of choosing acupoints has not been reported.

Data Mining, also known as Knowledge Discovery in Database, is the nontrivial process of information extraction which have connotative, unknown but potentially useful pattern, by means of data analysis, to find the rule from the large amounts of data, is the front-burner issue from artificial intelligence and database research field so far[9]. Association rule mining technology is gordian technique in this study, which is an important branch from the data mining research.

There are commonly used algorithm of association rules mining related with Apriori algorithm at present, such as based on classification algorithm and the tree of FP - frequency set algorithm, etc. The purpose of this study is to explore the affinity of acupoints and compatibility, meridian system, position of it. The APRIORI algorithm is adopted to find the acupoint uses and the regularity of compatibility from treating tension headache.



II. METHODS  A. Search Strategy 1) Online retrieval  CNKI, VIP, WanFang and PubMed database. All retrieval time was from Jan. 1, 2001 to Mar. 1, 2013.

Retrieval strategy: ("tension-type headache "[Mesh] AND "Acupuncture"[Mesh]), Limits Activated: Humans, Clinical trial.

2) Manual retrieval       Library search ?Journal of Chinese Medicine?, ?Journal of Chinese Medicine. English edition?, ?Chinese Journal of Integrative Medicine?, ?Chinese Acupuncture and Moxibustion? etc. above magazines retrieval years are form start publication to Mar. 1, 2013.

? Abstracts.

D. Create database Retrieve all clinical trials about abdominal acupuncture,  read titles and abstracts, read the full text, extract articles which meet inclusion criteria and mismatch the exclusion criteria. Delete duplicate papers after reading titles and abstracts, English literature replace other languages, degree thesis replace journal publication of the same content. Two researchers evaluated articles separately, careful understanding and discussion with the questions was raised before analysis, consulted when disagreement happened.

Use SPSS 18.0 to establish a database "tension headache Meridian Acupuncture database application characteristics".

Each data include: Acupoints, channels and collaterals, parts and documents coding information. Due to the literature, which involves many acupoints, to facilitate the statistics, data mining will account for the popularity < l5 % data information for data statistics.

E. Data analysis Use the IBM SPSS Modeler 14.1 software imple-  mentation of data mining. The Apriori algorithm for mining association rules, computing support degree(S) and confidence coefficient(C) of acupoint?s item-sets support confidence. Analyze of the application regularity of acupoins, acupoints compatibility and application of specific acupoint.

Importance of three concept, support degree, confidence coefficient and lift. Support degree to indicate the probability of A and B appear simultaneously, To explain the statistical significance of rules in the whole data concentration; Confidence coefficient show that probabilistic appearance of B when A have already there, used to measure the credible degree of association rules. Lift reveal the influence of the appearance of A to B. Lift >1 is meaningful, show the acceleration of  the appearance of A to B.



III. RESULTS  A. Literature Retrieval Results An initial search of the literature is 151. Through reading  titles and abstracts exclude 85 articles for reasons ranging from articles that were review, case reports or experiment research. Further review of the papers excluded 39 trials for reasons ranging from trials that were duplicate publications to trials that applied acupuncture as minor treat. Inclusion criteria were met by 27 acupuncture clinical trails. (Fig.1).

B. Data mining results 1) Commonly used acupoints  Acupoints frequency refer to the the acupoint selected in acupuncture treatment and its number of being selected.

Among the 27 qualified papers, 17 acupoints are commonly used for the treatment of tension-type headache, according to the decreasing order as shown in table I.

The Support of acupoints > 50% include DB20(77.78%), EX - HN5(66.67%), DU20(51.85%). The Support of ST8, SP6 is 33.33%. The Support of EX - HN1, GB8, LR3 and LI4 is 29.63%. The Support of EX - HN3, BL10, PC6, ST40 and AShi is 25.93%. The Support of RN12, SI3 and ST36 is lower, only 22.22%.

2) Acupoints Compatibility Rule In modern clinical research, double acupoints compati-  bility is commonly used in acupuncture treatment on tension- type headache. The top five is showed in table II. And in it, EX - HN5 combining with GB20 is the most common, the Support is 77.78%, the Confidence is 80.95%, and the Lift is 1.214. EX - HN5 combining with DU20 and  GB20 combining with DU20, the Support is 51.85%, the Confidence is 85.71%. GB20 combining with ST8 and GB20 combining with LI4, the Support is 29.63%, the Confidence is 88.89%, 100%, respectively.

Table III show three acupoints compatibility. And in it, EX - HN5 combining with GB20 and Du20 is most commonly used. The support is 44.44%, the confidence was 100%, and the Lift is 1.500. EX - HN5 combining with GB20 and ST8, the support was 29.63%, the confidence is 87.50%, and the Lift is 1.312. GB20 combining with EX - HN5 and BL10, GB20 combining with EX - HN5 and EX ? HN1, the support is 25.93%, the confidence respectively are 100%, 100% and 85.71%.

This shows that there were a strong correlation between these acupoints.

C. The distribution of acupoints in meridian The acupoints for tension-type headache belong to 10  meridians (Fig. 3). Extra-points and Ashi are not analysed in this part, because they are not belonged to any meridians.

The most frequently used meridians are Gallbladder Meridian of Foot-Shaoyang (GB), Stomich Meridian of Foot-Yanginmg (ST), Du meridian (DU), the rate respectively are 29, 22, 14. The rest used meridians are Spleen Meridian of Foot-Taiyin (SP), Liver Meridian of Foot-Jueyin (LR), Large Intestine Meridian of Hand- Yangming (LI), Bladder Meridian of Foot-Taiyang (BL), Pericardium Meridian of Hand-Jueyin (PC), Ren Meridian (RN), Small Intestine Meridian of Hand-Taiyang (SI).

The GB meridians include acupoints: GB20, GB8. The ST meridians include acupoints: ST8, ST36, ST40. The DU meridians include DU20. The SP meridians include SP6. The LR meridians include LR3. The LI meridians include LI4.

The BL meridians include BL10. The PC meridians include PC6. The RN meridians include RN12. The SI meridians include SI3.

D. The distribution of acupoints in body The acupoints of acupunture for tension-type headache  can be distributed 4 parts: head, arms, legs, abdomen. The number of acupoints on the head are 9, include DU20, GB20, GB8, BL10, ST8, EX - HN5, EX ? HN3, EX ? HN1, Ashi, total frenquencies are 99; 3 acuponints on the arms, include LI4, PC6, SI3, total frenquencies are 30; 4 acuponints on the legs, include ST36, ST40, LR3, SP6, total frenquencies are 21; Only one acuponints on the abdomen, is  RN12, frenquency 30.(Fig. 4)

IV. DISCUSSION By way of Data Mining from modern clinical literature  about acupuncture treatment on tension-type headache, On the basis of the apriori algorithm, draw basic law between commonly used meridians, acupoints and compatibility of them. The law has similarities with principal of acupuncture clinical practice[10-12]. In this paper, we analyzed the data mining results from the angle of traditional acupuncture theory.

A. Acupoints in common use: GB20,EX-HN5,DU20.

GB20 belongs to gall bladder meridian of foot shao-yang,  is a confluent acupoint with Yangwei Meridian. It is adept in dispel the pathogenic wind, therapeutical effect on wind- dispersing and blood-activating, clarification on mind and acuity of vision, relieve pain and dredging collaterals, particularly appropriate for one who catched the exogenous pathogenic wind. It is commonly of GB20 compatible with GB8, treating with various kinds of headache and intermittent headache.

DU20 is another confluent acupoint which connect every three yang meridians from hand and foot,The one of acupoint from five- confluent points introduced by The Internal Canon of Medicine,also have been regarded as an omnipotent acupoint which could have effects on all the various illnesses,especially headache. The A-B Classic of Acupuncture and Moxibustion says, ?Pain in the crown area, severe intermittent headache, eye ache bilges can not be turned, chose DU20.? This acupoint in the center of the head, and belongs to governor meridian,could be the Preferred choice for the headache.

EX- HN5 is the extra point, applied to pacify and extinguish liver-wind, heat-clearing and detoxify, Is the significant point for the treatment of amphicrania. Book VII from The A-B Classic of Acupuncture and Moxibustion says, ?drunkenness and wind-heat factor could cause amphicrania.?  The compatibility of various acupoints, Local point selection have GB20, GB8, ST8, The distal one have ST36, DU20, EX-HN3, PC6 are according to symptoms,  EX- HN5, BL10 are to diseases, ST40, LR3 are are to pathogeny; also the selection treatment based on syndrome differentiation chosed SP6, RN12. Take account of all factors which be interrelated.

B. Common meridians: the Gallbladder Meridian of foot- Shaoyang, DU meridian, the Stomach Meridian of Foot- yangming.

The Gallbladder channel of Foot-shaoyang originates  from the outer canthus, ascends to the corner of the forehaed, and then descends to the posterior of the ear, going out from GB20, is the longest one which runs from the head around.

The Gallbladder channel of Foot-shaoyang action on all kinds of pain, is the main meridian to treat headache.

The DU meridian originates from the lower abdomen, travels backwards along the interior side of the spinal colum, contact with Foot-shaoyang and enters into the brain, in close relationship with cerebrum and medulla spinalis. Yang meridian of hand and foot are transit from DU14 to governor meridian. Yangwei Meridian and yangqiao meridian are connect with governor meridian  as well, which come from eight extra channels. So it have been called the sea of yang channels. The acupoins from it are good at treating encephalopathy as a result of link with all of yang meridian and circulated around head. Indications of it suggests that ?Positive condition would have strong spine, deficiency would suffer from headache.?  The stomach meridian of foot-yangming counts among that have plenty of qi and blood circulation. ST36, lower sea point of stomach, is a very important acupoint to our body health, good at norishing yang-qi, main point for health protection, mainly used for asthenic Disease. The Poem of Hallway indicated that ?ST36 could  treat  the exhaustion or lesion of the five internal organs?.

C. Common acupoint selection ocation: the head Disease location of tension headache is in the brain, It is  important to do syndrome differentiation according to meridians and pay attention to some acupoints which have effects on dredging blood and qi circulation, soothe the nerves, sustain brains. The main acupoint for treatment like DU20, GB 20, EX-HN5, EX-HN3 for dredging the meridian, dredging the local part meridian and Clearing the head or the orifices. The yang- qi circulation is gathered into head, the three meridian of hand and foot and jueyin meridian are pass around the head, the governor meridian directly linked with brain.

The part of headache would be differ from the pathogenic factors attack. Generally, The pain of the taiyang headache appears in the occipital region, yangming headache in the         Head Arm Leg Abdomen Par t s  fr eq  ue nc  y Acupoi nt  number Acupoi nt  f r equency      forehead and brow, shaoyang headache on the lateral side of the head and ears, and a jueyin headache at the apex of the head. Diagnosing with channel identification correctly, according to the rule ?Indications come up with the location of acupoints?, play a part in function of proximal therapeutic effects. Such as DU20, DU24, ST8, GB20, BL2 are chosen by corresponding channel point selection, but EX-HN1 used byheadache attack from jueyin meridian.

In summary, Using the data mining technology, by ways of modern data mining association rules analysis method, to analyze the modern clinical research literature of acupuncture therapy for tension headache, statistical results could be basis and reference for clinical point pelection and combination. Take data mining technology can excavate characteristic of acupoint and law of acupuncture recipe which under the meridian theory of TCM?s guidance, in addition, on the basis of asocciation rules that combined with basic rule of matching acupoint and the meridian theory of TCM. It is worth to be generalized.
