Abstract?The total life cycle systems management [TLCSM] imperative for military systems holds the program manager accountable for ?total system performance (hardware, software, and human), operational effectiveness, and suitability, survivability, safety, and affordability?.    Condition Based Maintenance Plus [CBM+], Reliability Centered Maintenance [RCM] and prognostic health management [PHM] for critical sub- systems, such as propulsion, are considered essential program elements in meeting this responsibility for total life cycle sustainability. 1  A key enabler for CBM+, RCM and PHM is adequate and accessible reliability data bases [RDB] as a primary source of the information needed to design and develop cost effective system provisions for initial deployment of new or upgraded propulsion systems.  In addition, cost effective sustainment of military propulsion systems implies continued maintenance and enhancement of RDB to address the inevitable emerging reliability issues that were neither anticipated nor detected during propulsion system design and development.

The expectations of TLCSM and the resultant deployment of CBM+, RCM and PHM will place increasing demands on RDB in terms of data collected, archived and processed to provide actionable information for maintainers, engineers and leaders responsible for maintenance process and configuration management, and mission planners and operational leadership.
