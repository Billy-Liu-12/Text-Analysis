Using Data Mining to Accelerate Cross-Selling

Abstract?Data mining is often used to discover hidden knowledge of large datasets, which is widely used in bussiness.

Cross-selling is very important in marketing and which is the practice of suggesting related products or services to a customer who is considering buying something. Data mining can accelerate cross-selling through finding the related products or services. In this paper, we mainly propose a method of data mining in Excel with an add-in of XLMiner to accelerate cross-selling. It does not need much speciality knowledge of data mining but only some parameter setting.

Additionally, almost everyone can use Excel skilled. Therefore, the proposed method, which is based on Excel, can be mastered by general selling people easily. This paper also present an example through mining association rules.

I. INTRODUCTION This section presents some background information  about cross-selling, data mining and association rule, Excel and XLMiner.

A. Cross-Selling Cross-selling is an important sales technique of  marketing and defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as "the action or practice of selling among or between established clients, markets, traders, etc." or "that of selling an additional product or service to an existing customer"[1].

There are many businesses definition in many different ways. Simply, cross-selling is offering a similar product to what a shopper is looking at -- either an alternative model or accessories that go with the product. It is designed to widen the customer's reliance on the company and decrease the likelihood of the customer switching to a competitor.

Using a cross-selling strategy is likely to result in:  (1)Customers finding exactly what they are looking for, thus increasing the rate of order completion, and/or  (2)Customers adding accessories to their original selection, thus increasing the order total.

Cross-selling is very useful to boost sales. Businesses that offer more than one product or service often use the cross-selling technique for marketing. For example, selling a color-coordinated tie and a shirt to go along with a selected suit , successful bankers always look for opportunities to sell  credit cards, insurance, and mutual fund products to their existing account holders.

Cross-selling is also very common with in-bound telemarketing calls. It should be done in a pleasant way and never pressed, though it may simply sound like a temptation for impulse buying, cross-selling offers legitimate added benefits to shoppers.

B.  Data mining and Association rule Explosive growth in data and databases has generated an  urgent need for new techniques and tools that can intelligently and automatically turn the processed data into useful information and knowledge. Data mining has consequently emerged and become a research area with increasing importance[2].

Data mining is the analysis of (often large) observational data sets to find unsuspected relationships and to summarize the data in novel ways that are both understandable and useful to the data owner[3]. It plays a vital role in business expansion. By knowing customer behavior based on past records, increased profits from cross-selling and other business strategies can be achieved[4]. Data mining have many alias, such as knowledge discovery in database(KDD), pattern discovery, Knowledge extracting, data dredging, data archeology and so on[5].

Data mining owns many technique and we only take association rules as example here. Association rules  is pioneer of data mining and one of the most active point of data mining[6]. It shows attribute value conditions that occur frequently together in a given dataset. A typical and widely- used example of association rule mining is market basket analysis.

Association rule is defined as statements in the form of ?if-then?, of which ?if? part and ?then? part are called antecedent and consequent respectively. For example, if buy milk then buy bread. It could be used for adjusting store layouts (placing items optimally with respect to each other), for cross-selling, for promotions, for catalog design and to identify customer segments based on buying patterns. These rules are computed from the data, which is unlike the if-then rules of logic. By the way, association rules are probabilistic in nature.

?Support? and ?confidence? are two important numbers to express the degree of uncertainty about the rule.

(The support is sometimes expressed as a percentage of the total number of records in the database.)  Confidence is the ratio of the number of transactions that include all items in the consequent as well as the antecedent (namely, the support) to the number of transactions that include all items in the antecedent.

For example, if a market database has 100,000 point-of- sale transactions, out of which 2,000 include both items A and B and 800 of these include item C, the association rule "If A and B are purchased then C is purchased on the same trip" has a support of 800 transactions (alternatively 0.8%=800/100,000) and a confidence of 40% (=800/2,000).

Lift is one more parameter of interest in the association rules mining. Lift is the ratio of Confidence to Expected Confidence. Expected Confidence in this case means "confidence, if buying A and B does not enhance the probability of buying C." It is the number of transactions that include the consequent divided by the total number of transactions. Suppose the number of total number of transactions for C is 5,000. Thus Expected Confidence is 5,000/1,00,000=5%, and the Lift = Confidence/Expected Confidence = 40%/5% = 8. Hence Lift is a value that gives us information about the increase in probability of the "then" (consequent) given the "if" (antecedent) part.

C. Cross-Selling and association rule There are some data analysis techniques to find potential  customer of cross-selling in financial industry, such as acquisition patterns[7]. From above of this paper, we can see that cross-selling is based on the related products and association rule can represent certain dependencies between products in a given dataset. It?s very easy to find out related products and even unrelated products but often purchased together with the help of the discovered dependencies.

D. Excel and XLMiner Excel is part of Microsoft Office suite. It is a spreadsheet  program that can organize data into lists and then summarize, compare, and present data graphically. Excel?s forte is performing numerical calculations, and Excel is also very useful for non-numerical applications [8].

Excel can find the sum, average, or maximum value of given dataset; create a graph showing what percentage of sales were in a particular range; and show how the total sales compared with the total sales of other days in the same week.

Shortly, Excel saves us from creating these summaries by hand.

Now, Excel has become a useful and efficient tool of data management and data analysis for researchers and managers, and is even quite indispensable to them.

XLMiner is a comprehensive data mining add-in for Excel developed by Cytel Software Corporation (markers of  StatXact, LogXact and Egret) and Distributed by Resampling Stats, Inc.

It is a toolbelt to help us get quickly started on data mining, offering a variety of methods to analyze large datasets.

It has extensive coverage of statistical and machine learning techniques for classification,  prediction,  affinity analysis  and  data exploration and reduction.

The first step to use XLMiner is to install it on computer.

Once installed, it can be registered in Excel as an add-in and emerges as a new option in menu bar. What?s more, it automatically activates very time when Excel runs.

Generally, the major researchers of data mining focus on efficient algorithms. Even there has been lots of data mining software, such as Clementine and SAS. But they are almost difficult to use for general people. We focus on the application and propose a simple method of data mining in Excel to accelerate cross-selling, which can be mastered by every one whether with or without specialty knowledge. The following sections illustrate detail process of this method through an example of mining association rule.



II. MINING ASSOCIATION RULES  A. Data preparation From now on in this paper, a set of bookstore selling data  is considered as the dataset to be mined in this paper. They are about customers buying child books(ChildBks), youth books(YouthBks), cook books (CookBks), do it yourself books(DoItYBks), reference books(RefBks), art books(ArtBks), geograph books(GeogBks), Secrets of Italian Cooking(ItalCook), Historical Atlas of Italy(ItalAtlas), Italian Art(ItalArt) and The Art History of Florence(Florence)[9].

After confirming which dataset to be mined, the next step is to organize them. Nowadays large scale data are often organized and stored in database, or in spreadsheet at least by their owners.

Fig.1 shows the datasets in this paper, which are organized in Excel and stored as a spreadsheet.

In this figure, 1 or 0 in column ChildBks means corresponding customer bought or didn?t buy child books.

The other columns are the same as this.

B. Data prepprocession The organized dataset is often incomplete, noisy,  inconsistent and called raw data. It usually does not agree with data mining requirement. Therefore, the dataset have to be preprocessed.

Data preprocessing describes any type of processing performed on raw data to prepare it for data handling.

Commonly used as a preliminary data mining practice, data      Figure 1.  Bookstore sales data organized in Excel .

preprocessing transforms the data into a format that will be more easily and effectively processed for the purpose of the user--for example, mining association rule. There are a number of different tools and methods used for preprocessing, including: sampling, which selects a representative subset from a large population of data; transformation, which manipulates raw data to produce a single input; denoising, which removes noise from data; normalization, which organizes data for more efficient access; and feature extraction, which pulls out specified data that is significant in some particular context[10].

XLMiner provides several tools of data preprocessing, such as sampling, missing data handling, binning continuous data and transforming categorical data. The whole process is finished in Excel.

For simplicity, dataset in this paper is considered as complete and non-noisy.

C. Mining association rules To mine association rules, we select XLMiner?Affinity-  -Association rules in the menu of Excel and the mining association rules box appears. Some parameters should be set in this box. Mining association rules only need set minimum   Figure 2.  Parameters seting in Association Rule box  support and minimum confidence. In this example, there are set as 40 and 0.80, as shown in Fig.2.

D. Result and its interpreting The result shows as Fig3.

From rule #1, it can be said that if an Italian cookbook was bought, a cook book will also be bought. The other rules can be interpreted in the same way.

This particular rule(rule #1) has confidence of 100%, meaning that, of the people who bought a book named Secrets of Italian Cooking, all (100%) bought cookbooks as well.  "Support (a)" indicates meaning that 54 people bought an Secrets  of  Italian  Cooking  and a cook book, total.

"Support (c)"  indicates  the  number  of  transactions involving the purchase of cook books, total. (This is a piece of side information -- it is not involved in calculating the confidence or support for the rule itself.) "Support (a U c)" is the number of transactions where a Secrets of Italian Cooking and a cook book were bought.

"Lift ratio" indicates how much more likely we are to encounter a cookbook transaction if we consider just those transactions where a Secrets of Italian Cooking is purchased, as compared to the entire population of transactions -- it's the confidence divided by support (c) where the latter is expressed as a percentage.



III. USING ASSOCIATION RULES TO ACCELERATE CROSS-SELLING  The rules mined out can give out which books have close relation and are usually bought together. Based on this, the merchandise can encourage a customer who buys a product (Italian cook book , for example) to buy a related or complementary product (cook book, for example). Some related products can be known easily, but the majority can only be known with the help of some other specially analysis tools. Data mining is exactly an effective tool to get related products and accelerate cross-selling, and then help merchandise get additional revenue from clients, offering them similar or complementary products.



IV. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION This paper proposed a method of data mining in Excel  with an add-in of XLMiner to accelerate cross-selling and showed that it can be used by general selling people without requirement of specialty knowledge about data mining.

However, there is certain difficulty in two parameter- settings of minimum support and minimum confidence, which have no definitely regular and depend on the people of applied field. Additionally, the two parameters influence the result mine out seriously.
