Promoting Robust Design of Diode Lasers for Space: A National Initiative

Abstract The Diode-laser Array Working Group (DAWG) is a national-level consumer/provider forum for discussion of engineering and manufacturing issues which influence the reliability and survivability of high-power broad-area laser diode devices in space, with an emphasis on laser diode arrays (LDAs) for optical pumping of solid-state laser media. The goals of the group are to formulate and validate standardized test and qualification protocols, operational control recommendations, and consensus manufacturing and certification standards. Reliability and lifetime data collected by laser diode manufacturers and the user community are being used to develop standardized guidelines for specifying and qualifying laser diodes for long-duration operation in space. Effective implementation of statistical design techniques at the supplier design, development, and manufacturing levels will aid in reducing product performance variability and improve product reliability for diodes employed in space applications. The ultimate goal is to promote an informed U.S. Government investment and procurement strategy for assuring the availability and durability of space-qualified LDAs.
