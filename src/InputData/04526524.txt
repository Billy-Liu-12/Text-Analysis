Autonomous Calibration of Vehicle Cabin Atmosphere Monitor

Abstract The Vehicle Cabin Atmosphere Monitor (VCAM) is designed to autonomously detect and identify trace organic species in the International Space Station (ISS) cabin air and monitor changes in species concentrations over time after chemical events. VCAM uses a gas chromatograph and quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer to separate chemical analytes and determine mass fractionation patterns of the chemical analytes. In order to obtain the desired mass resolution and dynamic range, several instrument parameters must be calibrated.

We present our lessons learned developing a heuristic calibration procedure and translating the procedure into a procedure suitable for direct conversion to flight software.

The heuristic procedure involves the detection of changes in signal trends that humans can easily recognize, but are not necessarily straightforward to codify in an algorithm. We developed an algorithm by working closely with instrument experts and designed several test cases and data sets to verify that the algorithm achieved the same as the original  human heuristics. 12  electric field to hyperbolic electrodes and ramping the amplitude of the electric field at a constant rate [3]. One of the operation requirements for VCAM is that the mass spectrometer parameters should be autonomously calibrated before each measurement, which is scheduled once a day. In order to autonomously calibrate the instrument parameters, one has to carefully design the flow and order of calibration steps and develop criteria for each calibration step. Once the overall procedure and its elements are formulated, one has to review the procedure through mental experiments as well as direct experiments.

In this paper, we present our lessons learned in developing a heuristic calibration procedure and translating the procedure into an algorithm suitable for direct conversion to flight software. Section 2 describes how the heuristic calibration procedure was developed. Section 3 presents the final version of the developed calibration procedure. Flight software is implemented based on the final version and is described in Section 4. A summary of the work is given in Section 5.
