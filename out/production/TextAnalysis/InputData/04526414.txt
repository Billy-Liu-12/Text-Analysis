Performance Metric Issues for Space Time Adaptive Processing Methods

Abstract Space Time Adaptive Processing was introduced to the radar community in the 1970's as a multi-dimensional filtering method to discriminate moving targets from clutter when observed from an air-borne/space-borne multi- channel phased array radar. Numerous variants of this filtering technique have been developed and are often compared to some baseline performance with respect to output signal to interference plus noise ratio or minimum mean square error. Under clairvoyant conditions these metrics have a direct relation to probability of detection.
