When of distribution.

employed to detect a transient change in distribution, Page's test is easy to implement and, since it is a GLRT, it provides The quickest detection of a change in distributions, occurring reliable performance. However, its application to unknown at unknown time points, is an old but important problem [3], transient changes is less clear. The situation of interest in this [4].

2. THE NEW ADAPTIVE PAGE'S TEST the forms Motivation 1  In model (10), suppose both fo and fi are exactly known. fo(x) = 2w Then the Page test update g (x) is optimally the log likelihood fX(x) 1 212 ratio (LLR). If nothing whatever is known about fi (noise Nx2-w plus transient), then the situation is probably hopeless; but if the situation is that the transient type is of a scale change, as for which the corresponding LLR is when (11) might be used, then the problem is to determine the correct bias and threshold. Now, the update rule g(x) is g(X) = pX 2/2 (13) in general designed (or "tuned") to a particular transient type, more specifically to a specific transient strength within some In this simple situation constant fixed-length detectability can pdf family, represented by the optimal "built-in" bias. As op- be assured by specifying that posed to the fixed-length detection problem where a proce- dure usually provides better performance for a high energy SL (14) signal if it works well for a low energy one, this fortunate NL( situation does not carry through to quickest detection. For instance, the empirical variance provides a uniformly most where L is the length of the transient signal. Here "A" is powerful (UMP) test for the fixed-length Gaussian scale-shift ,u, which is conveniently parameterized by SL, the aggregate problem, but it will be seen that ( 11) can be easily dominated SNR for the L-length transient, and the meaning is that SL when the parameter Or2 is guessed poorly. This is key: (thus the bias b and the threshold h) is chosen to yield desired  Pd and T for the specific L-length transient signal. We are in- We are interested in the detection oftime-contiguous tran- terested in probability of detection Pd for different transients: sients with unknown location and strength: the pdf fi in the "run-length" metric D of (4) is not sufficient, and we rely (10) has the sameform as fo, yet with a parameter A that on the Markov-chain analyses of [11] to evaluate both Pd and is unknown and whose magnitude controls the transient T. A synopsis of this approach is available in Appendix A of signal's detectability. this paper.

Certainly this is a restrictive assumption, but it is satisfied in It turns out that Page's test provides nowhere near constant many interesting problems: for example, consider the case of detectability, as shown in figure 2, in which Pd = 0.8, fo a unit-normal pdf, and fi a Gaussian with mean , > 0, T = 106 and the sample length N = 103. It is noted that or similarly fi a Gaussian with variance ur2 > 1. Now, since Page's test designed for a short-and-loud transient (transient it is not unnatural in practice that some transients are short- length L = 1, 2 and 4) provides good performance for such a and-loud, while some are long-and-quiet, we argue here that transient but shows very poor performance at detecting tran- it is not a practically useful goal simply to be able to detect sients with L > 50. Similarly, a Page procedure designed for transients with a particular strength and length at least nd. We long-and-quiet transients (e.g. L = 200, and 400) proves very propose that: poor at the detection of short-and-loud transients. To explain  this, we plot the design biases (,u/2) and thresholds (obtained A useful scheme should detect any transient signal whose via [11]) versus transient length as the "fixed" curves on the fixed-length detectability exceeds a given value, given the right of figure 3, in which Pd = 0.8 and T = 106; in the left average number of samples between false alarms be at figure, we also show the aggregate SNR required to achieve least T. the desired performance. It can be seen that a long-and-quiet  transient is better served by a small negative bias and a high In [1],[9] the proper scheme for biasing a Page detector is threshold but ill-served by the large bias and low threshold explored in the case that the magnitude of a distribution's designed for short-and-loud transient signals; and vice versa.

The situation in this Thus we have a quandary: the results of [18] show quite paper is different: it is desired to detect all signals whose de- clearly that the variance-based Page procedure is a natural, tectability is beyond a certain level, and since both transient simple and robust choice for the detection of a wide variety length and strength are open, a search for a least-detectable of transient signals.

One finds that ag depends little on To. Normally, the above iteration needs to be repeated only a few times.

Note that there is assumed to be a sample length N, serving as the maximum transient length. It may be that there is also a minimum transient length, in which case modification is obvious.

However, though the adaptive The quicker the performance of a fixed-style Page test decays, scheme achieves almost the performance of the "envelope" the smaller N is.

The the performance loss for detecting short transients, since Page reason lies in that, with the current N and thus b, the Page test test is very sensitive to transient length, as shown in figure 2. tends to over-index the true start point, as plotted in figure 14.
