A Novel Multi-User MIMO Scheme in OFDM Systems

Abstract?Multi-User MIMO (MU-MIMO) is the technique which used in the scenarios with a large number of users to be served in one cell, and high capacity gains can be achieved by transmitting independent data streams to different users sharing the same time-frequency resources. Because more than two users share the same time-frequency resources in MU-MIMO systems, there is a big problem for the receiver to cancel the interference of the other users. Inspired by the idea of interference cancellation in CDMA systems, a novel multi-user MIMO scheme is proposed in this paper. It employs spreading in the transmitter and joint detection (SP-JD) in the receiver. Simulation results show that SP-JD scheme could achieve higher sum rates capacity and better bit error rate (BER) performance than Zero-Forcing (ZF) scheme while the receiver is not aware of the precoding vectors applied to the streams transmitted to the other users.

I.  INTRODUCTION Multiple-input multiple output (MIMO) systems has  been an attractive research field in recent years. It was shown that MIMO system can increase the channel capacity of the system significantly [1], [2]. More recently, attention has shifted to multiuser MIMO systems because they have the potential to combine the high capacity achievable with MIMO processing with the benefits of space-division multiple access (SDMA).

However, in multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) system, the inter-user interference is generated when the resources are allocated to multiple users. In order to avoid the inter- user interference we can use dirty paper coding (DPC) [3].

It was shown that the interference which is known a priori to the transmitter does not affect the channel capacity.

DPC is an optimal precoding method that achieves the channel capacity. However, it is not practical in real systems since its complexity is prohibitive.

In order to make it possible to apply MU-MIMO system to real systems, many suboptimal schemes were proposed by researchers. e.g. block diagonalization (BD) [4], Zero-forcing (ZF) [5] and Per-User Unitary and Rate Control (PU2RC) [6].

BD looks for the null space of interference channels. It eliminates the interference among the selected users. Since each user?s precoding matrix must lie in the null space of all other users? channels, the number of users that can be simultaneously supported with BD is limited by the number of transmit antennas and the number of receive antennas [7], because the number of transmit antennas is  no smaller than the total number of receive antennas in the system.

Since both ZF and PU2RC are closed-loop MIMO schemes, user basically needs to feed back a list of information including preferred precoding index and its CQI to the Node B. Compared with ZF scheme, PU2RC has a drawback in scheduling the streams to the selected user subset, only the users with the same preferred precoding matrix can be a candidate for the scheduling, resulting in decrease of multiuser diversity [8].

On the other hand, although ZF scheme is designed such that the received signal is free from multiuser interference in theory. However, due to channel quantization and feedback delay, some multiuser interference will exist. So LMMSE receiver must be employed at the receiver to reduce the interference and improve system performance, but this requires that the precoding vectors applied to the streams transmitted to interference users are known. If the receiver is not aware of the precoding vectors applied to the streams transmitted to the other users, it is not able to reject the interference from the other users, and can only maximize the received power [9]. But in real systems, the receiver is usually not aware of other users? precoding vectors. In order to solve this problem, we propose a novel multi-user MIMO scheme in which every user don?t need to aware of the precoding vectors applied to the streams transmitted to the others, but also achieve higher capacity and better bit error rate (BER) performance.

This paper is organized as follows: Section ? describes the signal model used in the paper. Section ? introduces the MU-MIMO scheme proposed in 3GPP LTE. Section ? introduces the novel multi-user MIMO scheme proposed in this paper. In section ? , the simulation results are provided and finally, conclusions are given in section ?.

II. SIGNAL MODEL A downlink MU-MIMO system model comprises a  transmitter with tN transmit antennas and sN users each occupying at most rN receive antennas. And we limited to single layer transmission to a particular user, so the number of streams transmitted simultaneously equal to sN .The signal received by user k is given by  2009 Pacific-Asia Conference on Circuits,Communications and System  DOI 10.1109/PACCS.2009.92     ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )   sN k k l l k  l= = +?y H U x n                       (1)  where ( ) r tk N N??H is the channel coefficient matrix to user k , ( ) tl N N??U is the channel precoding matrix to user l , ( )l N?x represent the transmitted vectors to user 1, , sl N= containing N information symbols, and  ( ) rk N?n is white Gaussian noise vector distributed as ( )20,N ? I .We rewrite (1) in equivalent matrix form  ( ) ( ) ( )k k k= +y H Ux n                               (2)  where ( ) ( )1 sN? ?= ? ?U U U and  ( )  ( )   sN  ? ? ? ?  = ? ? ? ? ? ?  x x  x  .

III. LINER MU-MIMO SCHEME IN 3GPP LTE ZF proposed to 3GPP-LTE is considered as a baseline  model for MU-MIMO because of it can cancel the interference from the other users and reuse the precoding codebook of single user MIMO [5].

The block diagram of ZF scheme for MU-MIMO system is illustrated in Figure 1. Each user estimates the MIMO channel matrix based on common reference signals. The singular value decomposition (SVD) of channel matrix H  is given by H=H U?V . Assuming the receiver beamformer is left singular vector U . Selects an appropriate codeword from a given codebook of vector and computes the effective CQI independently. The CQI at a given carrier with one interfering user can be calculated as   2 2  ( / 2) | | 1 (1/ )( / 2) || ||  H k k k  k H T k k q  P CQI  N P e =  + U H u  U H (4)  where   H  Hk k q kH  k k  e = ? U H u U H  is the quantization error, P is  the total transmit power, TN is the number of transmit antennas.

The codeword u is selected from a codebook to best represent the vector quantity HU H  where U is the receive beamformer and H is the channel matrix. Note that the codeword u  selected from a unitary matrix codebook by selecting a preferred precoding matrix and preferred column. The selected codeword, u , and the corresponding estimated CQI are fed back to the Node B. This information is used by the Node B to schedule users, user scheduling algorithm of maximum sum capacity criterion [11] is adopted by Node B. Transmit beamformer weights are given by the normalized columns of the matrix W  ( ) 1H ? ?= +W X X X I                          (5) where [ ]1 2X = u u , 1u  and 2u  being the codewords corresponding to the two users scheduled by Node B, I  is the identity matrix and ?  is a small constant.

In the receiver, minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion is applied for signal detection. Receive beamformer is  ( )( ) ( )12k H HR k k k? ?  = +W H W H W I H W          (6)  where, W is the transmit beamformer matrix, 2? is the power of noise, kH is the channel matrix of user k .

IV. THE NOVEL MULTI-USER MIMO SCHEME Analyze the above MU-MIMO scheme in 3GPP-LTE,  one can see that ZF scheme has a drawback that the receiver has to know the whole precoding matrix to reject the interference from the other users, but it is unreasonable for the receiver to know the other users? precoding vector in real systems. In order to resolve this problem, a novel multi-user MIMO scheme is proposed in this paper. It employs spreading in the transmitter and joint detection (SP-JD) in the receiver. The block diagram of SP-JD scheme for MU-MIMO system is illustrated in Figure 2.

Figure 2.  Block diagram of SP-JD scheme for MU-MIMO System  In order to compare the system performance between SP-JD scheme and ZF scheme, each user only feeds back the index of precoding vector and the corresponding estimated CQI to Node B, and maximum sum capacity user-scheduling algorithm [11] is applied to find the user subsets in SP-JD scheme. The number of users in the user subsets is SN . Figure 2 shows that the modulated symbols of user k  will spread by orthogonal sequence ( )kc  before linear precoding in the transmitter, and Orthogonal     Variable Spreading Factor (OVSF) [12] code is used as the spreading code thanks to its characteristic of variable length. In order to decrease the loss of spectrum efficiency, the length of OVSF code is as short as possible. In this paper, the length of OVSF code equal to the number of users in the user subsets, and here is SN . So the orthogonal sequence can be expressed as  ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )( )1 2, , , sk k k kNc c c=c ,  1, , sk N=              (7) And the orthogonal sequences of OVSF code are listed  in Figure 3.

Tree construction of OVSF codes  The spreading sequences can?t keep completely orthogonal because of the Doppler shift and time delay spread characteristic of transmission channel in real systems, so joint detection (JD) algorithm is applied to eliminate the multiple access interference (MAI) between different users in the receiver. In order to reduce the complex of joint detection but ensure the system performance, the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) equalization is applied in the JD algorithm.

The MMSE equalization, looks for a continuous valued unbiased estimate, MMSE BLEd ? , which minimizes  ( ) 11 1 1H HMMSE BLE k n k x k n kd ?? ? ?? = +A R A R A R r            (8) where kA  is system matrix of user k , which contains the information of spreading code kc and equivalent channel matrix ? kH ( ? k k k= ?H H u , where kH  and ku denote the channel matrix and the precoding vector of user k ) after precoding. kr denotes the received signal sequence of user k . xR  and nR  denote covariance matrix of transmit signal sequence x  and the noise sequence n . In this paper,  { }Hx = ? =R x x ?E , and 2n ?=R I . The continuous valued estimate of (8) becomes  ( )2 12 n x  H H MMSE BLE k k k kd ? ?  ? ? =  =  = + R I R I  A A I A r             (9)

V. SIMULATION RESULTS In this section, we provide results on the achievable  sum rates and bit error rate performance with the linear MU-MIMO schemes which have been described above.

We consider the Node B with four transmitting antennas and each user with two receive antennas, and we limited to single layer transmission to a particular user.

In Figure 4, we compare the achievable sum rates performance between different schemes. The upper part of Figure 4 shows results with 4 users competing for the  available resources, and the lower part shows results of the scene with 20 users. The number of feedback bits per user is 2 plus one real number for the CQI indicator. And Figure 5 shows the corresponding bit error rate (BER) performance between different schemes.

Figure 4.  Sum rates performance comparison of different schemes   Figure 5.  Bit error rate performance comparison of different schemes  From Figure 4 and Figure 5, one can see that when the number of users is small, the achievable sum rates and bit error rate performance of ZF scheme is approximately the same as SU-MIMO scheme, and the performance of SP-JD is much better than ZF scheme. This is due to the fact that  4 usersK=  20 usersK=  20 usersK =  4 usersK =     in case of only 4 users, the probability of Node B schedule optimal users in the user subsets is small. But SP-JD can fully cancel the interference between different users with applying the orthogonal spreading sequence in the transmitter and joint detection in the receiver. When the number of users increases from 4 to 20, the performance of SU-MIMO scheme keep unchangeably, but SP-JD and ZF scheme is improved. The reason is that the probability of Node B schedule optimal users in the user subsets is big when the number of users is large. But at every SNR, the achievable sum rates and bit error rate performance of SP- JD scheme is better than ZF scheme.



VI. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we proposed a novel multi-user MIMO  scheme in OFDM systems. The proposed scheme overcomes the drawback that the receiver has to know the whole precoding matrix to reject the interference from the other users in the ZF scheme. And the simulation results show that the SP-JD scheme achieves better sum rates and bit error rate performance than ZF scheme. But the SP-JD scheme also has a drawback that it decreases the spectrum efficiency because of spreading is applied in SP-JD not to obtain code division multiple gains, but to cancel the interference between multiple users. So the SP-JD scheme is a tradeoff scheme between performance benefit and spectrum efficiency loss, and it is a valuable MU-MIMO scheme to apply in the system of LTE-Advanced/IMT- Advanced.
