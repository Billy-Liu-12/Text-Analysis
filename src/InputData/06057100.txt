Application of Cloud Model in Credit Evaluation

Abstract?Credit risk had become the main cause of bank bankruptcy. Therefore, risk control and risk management  became the most important problem of credit loan. This study  used a series of credit evaluation indices to quantify the credit of  farmer in the form of number. Two models were built on these  indices according to the association rules and cloud theory.

Model A was used when the customer loaned from credit  cooperative at the first time. Model B was used when the farmer  was a regular customer who had loan records in the credit  cooperative. This system provided credit cooperative with  important credit loan data, and made decision-making more  scientifically and closer to reality, thus evade credit risk  effectively.

Financial trade had expanded sharply, new financial tools occurred continually, and some derivative financial products flooded into the market [1]. The market price of financial products such as interest rates and foreign exchange rates fluctuated, which made financial markets more and more complicated. The risks of financial institutions were getting more and more serious, and the proportion of credit risk in the financial risk had increased.

A report from the world' bank said that credit risk had become the main cause of bank bankruptcy. Therefore, risk control and risk management became the most important problem of credit loan.

Faced with the credit risk which had occurred in market economy, it is necessary to construct farmer credit system to solve credit problem, maintain the credit of credit cooperatives, ensure the safety of credit cooperatives' capital, and promote the healthy development of economy. Therefore, credit risk management problem is not only an autonomous behavior of internal management for credit cooperative as macro financial subject, but also the need to prevent farmer credit system and payment system from collapsing from overall situation [2].

The purpose of farmer credit evaluation is to quantify credit risk level of loan customer, that is to say, use certain method to evaluate borrowers' ability and will of repaying capital on time comprehensively, and express the credit risk in the form of simple symbols, and provide a basis for pricing credit loan asset and granting credit to customer. If credit evaluation is accurate, effective asset management and credit analysis can be performed based on it, and then credit cooperatives can provide just enough capital for possible risk scientifically so as to improve the efficiency of credit cooperatives, increase profits and remain higher financial flexibility when they suffer loss.

II METHODS  A. Correlation Analysis  Association analysis, the important method of data mining, is used to find out the meaningful correlation between the item sets in the large amounts of data, and discover the interesting association between the given items [3-4]. The support and confidence of the association rules are two measures of rule  Supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities  under Grant No. 2009JC006 and No. 2011PY038  *Corresponding author.

interest, and they respectively reflect the usefulness and certainty of rules. The specific definition is as follows [5]:  Let I={i1,i2,?,in} be a set of items, let D, the task-relevant data, be a set of database transactions where each transaction T is a set of items such that T ? I. Each transaction is associated with an identifier, called TID. Let A be a set of items.

Transaction T is said to contain A if and only if A? T. an association rule is an implication of the form A=>B, where A I, B ? I, and A B=? ? . The rule A=>B holds in the transaction set D with support s, where s is the percentage of transactions in D that contain A B. This is taken to be the probability, P(A B). The rule A=>B has confidence c in the transaction set D, where c is the percentage of transactions in D containing A that also containing B. This is taken to be the conditional probability, P(B|A). That is,  Support(A=>B) = P(A B) (1)  Confidence(A=>B)=P(B|A)                 (2)  B. Cloud Model  In the widespread uncertainty of subjective and objective world, randomness and fuzziness are two most important forms.

Randomness refers to the uncertainty contained in the events which have very clear definition but do not necessarily appear.

Fuzziness refers to the uncertainty contained in the events which necessarily appear and are difficult to determine the precise definition.

Random mathematics and fuzzy mathematics respectively describe the randomness and fuzziness, but can't describe the relevance of them [6]. In fact, randomness and fuzziness often appeared together and do not exist independently in nature and human society. According to the above problems, Deyi Li proposed a new concept of membership cloud on the basis of random mathematics and fuzzy mathematics in 1995.

Membership can not only reveals the intrinsic relationship between random and fuzzy, but also realize conversion between qualitative concept and its quantitative description.

A normal compatibility cloud is defined by three digital characteristics, mapping between the qualitatives and the quantities. The expectation (Ex) of a compatibility cloud is the position at U corresponding to the center of gravity of the  cloud. In other words, the element Ex in the universe of discourse is fully compatible with the linguistic term M. The entropy (En) of a linguistic term is a measure of the fuzziness of the concept within the universe of discourse. The entropy of a linguistic term shows how many elements in the universe of discourse can be accepted to the linguistic term. The hyper entropy (He) is a measure of the randomness of the compatibility function. The thickness of the normal compatibility cloud is uneven. It is obvious that the cloud model combines all these ideas into a whole [6].

Figure 1. Exception curve of the normal cloud model  In Fig.1, the curve of expectation is the solid line which smoothly goes through the ?middle? and meanwhile draws the outline of ?cloud?, namely the ?skeleton? of cloud droplets set, all of the cloud droplets fluctuate randomly near the curve of expectation, and the extent of the fluctuation is controlled by He [7-10].

Membership cloud has no edge. It is stretchable and flexible. It has the same characteristics as the real cloud in the sky. Looked from a distance, it has obvious shape. While looked from a distance, it has no certain edge. Both of them have the character of coagulability and overall movement.

Therefore, membership cloud is described by its whole shape and coagulability, and it is significant and impossible to discuss the membership of a point in membership cloud.

Unified expression was realized for both fuzziness and randomness through the definition of membership cloud.

III RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS  A. Application of Correlation Analysis  Two models were constructed in this study. The model A was built on the basis of the basic personal information of      farmers (age, sex, education level, occupation, etc), property information of current year (family total assets of current years, family income of current years, family total liabilities of current years, etc) and the loan amount of current year. Model B was built on loan amount, reimbursement in the past three years and the information included in model A. That is to say, the count of index in model B was six more than the count of index in model A.

Confidence and weight of 22 indices in Model A was shown in Table . Confidence (Ci) was calculated by correlation analysis, and the weight of each index was calculated using the following formula:  Wi=Ci/ Ci                  (3)  TABLE I CONFIDENCE AND WEIGHT OF INDICES IN MODEL A  Index Confidence(%) Weight(%)  Sex of household 38.95 5.24  Age of household 25.36 3.41  Education of household 50.00 6.72  Skills of household 30.07 4.04  Occupation of household 31.88 4.29  Age of spouse 27.17 3.65  Education of spouse 50.00 6.72  Skills of spouse 30.07 4.04  Occupation of spouse 31.88 4.29  Dread disease 39.67 5.33  Number of maintenance 22.10 2.97  Natural disaster 36.59 4.92  Arable land area 16.12 2.17  Forest area 28.44 3.82  Pound area 38.95 5.24  Life insurance 31.34 4.21  Property insurance 30.62 4.12  Agricultural insurance 40.22 5.41  Family?s total assets 16.12 2.17  Family?s total liabilities 37.14 4.99  Total family net income 16.49 2.22  Loan amount 40.40 5.43  Confidence and weight of 28 indices in Model B were shown in Table .

Application of Cloud Model  The function of normal compatibility cloud generators is to implement the transformation between the qualitatives and the quantities. The forward cloud generator (CG) is the mapping from the qualitative concept to the quantitative data. It can produce as many drops of cloud as you like according to three digital characteristics. In contrast, the backward cloud generator (CG-1) is the mapping from the quantities to the qualitatives. That is to say, it can transform the exact data to the corresponding qualitative concept characterized by three digital characteristics.

x  In this study, one-dimension cloud was built. The variate xi was calculated according to the following formula:  IV CONCLUSION  This study used a series of credit evaluation indices to quantify the credit of farmer in the form of number. And a credit evaluation decision support system was built on the models. Model A was used when the customer loaned from credit cooperative at the first time. Model B was used when the farmer was a regular customer who had loan records in the credit cooperative. This system provided credit cooperative with important credit loan data, and made each salesman master the current situation and perform comprehensive evaluation rapidly. It help the manager make short-term forecasting, adjusted credit loan strategy and took the appropriate measures, thus evade credit risk effectively.
