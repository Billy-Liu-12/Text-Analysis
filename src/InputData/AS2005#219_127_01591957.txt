Multi-Hypotheses Tracking Algorithm Based on the Belief Theory

Abstract- The aim of this paper is to enhance the research works developed since 1998 by Gruyer and Royere. They established a tool for detections of vehicles and tracking based on the belief theory. Their approaches focus on the use of generalized Dempster's combination rules in the extended open world and they provide two partial views of the situation with two belief matrices. The first one represents the belief that targets are associated with tracks and the second one represents the belief that tracks are associated with targets.

To take the final decision they used the Hungarian algorithm which gives the better associations between targets and tracks according to the criteria of maximal global belief.

But this global association can lead to some suspicious local associations. This paper provides a solution in order to avoid theses disturbances with the development of a new MiT algorithm based on belief theory.

I. INTRODUCTION Target tracking is strongly used in robotic field. Main ap-  plications are the monitoring of the airspace and target con- trol for military purpose. More recently, this technique was considerably developed in the field of intelligent vehicles.

In this topic we can quote the books of Bar-Shalom [3], [4] and of Blackman and Popoli [5] as reference works.

Closer to the problems relating to the intelligent vehicles, various other works [8], [12] are based on the same tradi- tional algorithms and were improved in order to answer to certain constraints. The LIVIC (Interactions Vehicle- Infrastructure-Drivers research Laboratory) develops and uses tracking algorithms based on the belief theory using the Transferable Belief Model (TMB) [13]. Other target tracking works are done using an other model of the belief theory [16]. Theses tracking algorithms enhance the perception of objects on the road. Thus, behaviours of sur- rounding vehicles are analyzed and troubles or anomalies are detected. Therefore, safety of humans is increased.

To carry out target tracking, the system must be able  to realize two steps. The first stage is the state vectors prediction of known objects (from the time k-I to the time k) at the time k. Usually, this prediction step is achieved by the use of a Kalman filter. We call the result of this  Appearance of an Object  .* a2..i  *.aa.a.: .ta** I .I I.S 5 -5  Igg0 iSiE .

prediction the tracks. Then, sensors provide some new data.

With these data, the system extracts the perceived objects called the targets. The second stage, association step (figure 1), consists in establishing a correlation between the tracks and the targets.

It arises that the traditional methods of association for the tracking support either the tracks (PDAF and JPDAF' do not manage targets appearances) or the targets (MHT2 generates virtual targets).

In addition, it appears that few systems only manage the detection of appearance and/or disappearance of tracks.

The method suggested in [6] and [7] proposes a  global framework for association, tracking and appear- ance/disappearance management. In spite of its good per- formances, several remarks can be made with regard to this system. Not all the available information is used (in par- ticular the conflict). Moreover, this system is imperatively looking to associate all tracks (Yj) with all targets (Xi) with  1(J)PDAF: (Joint) Probability Data Association Filter 2MHT: Multi Hypotheses Tracking     maximizing the total belief of the global final association.

Unfortunately, this association can lead to disputable local associations.

After having introduced our notations, we present the specialized sources and we introduce the actual framework developed in [6] and [7] and show its limits through an example. Secondly, we provide a solution using a MHT algorithm based on two different approaches.



II. NOTATIONS  A. Mass Expression To express the mass on the hypothesis Xi is in relation  with Yj, Smets proposes the following notation:  ml'{Xi}(Yj) where e is the frame of discernement.

This strict notation is unfortunately syntactically quite  heavy. In order to light it, we propose to write (instead of mO {XX } (Yj1)):  mt,j (Hj ) Moreover, when we combine several sources, an advan-  tage of this second notation appears. The syntax allows to know where the mass is resulting from.

Example: let us consider two sources. The first one gives a bba about the relation Xi in relation with Yj: mn,j(Hj), the second one about the relation Xi is not in relation with Yk: mi,k(Hk). After combination, we obtain a mass mi,jk(Hj) and we know that it result from j and k.

If we consider m sources, the resulting mass after all the combinations is noted: mi,. (Hj). The dot means "all".

B. Unions of Hypotheses Expression By roughly speaking, we note a multi-hypothesis Hj U  Hk instead of {Hj 5Hk}.



III. GENERATION OF THE SPECIALIZED SOURCES From an index of agreement Iij between a target Xi  and a track Yj, a basic belief assignment (bba) is computed, based on the following postulate:  "A source of information does not have the right to say at the same time: a target is associated to a track and is not associated to this track."  The main interest of this model is to eliminate the intrinsic conflict. Thus, if several concordant sources are combinated, the generated conflict is limited.

In figure 2, two distributions of mass expressing the principle of this postulate are given. As we can see, a source can not give mass on Hj and on Hj (Hj is the hypothesis that Xi is associated with Yj).

The bba is defined using two functions: I1 for [0, Ti]  and 42 for [r2, 1]. The definition of these specialized distributions of mass is given by formula 1.

0 T I ICU o T1 t2 I ICU  Fig. 2. Example of two bba "in agreement with themselves". For a given ci,j . the source can not allow a non-null mass on Hj and on Hj in the same time.

The application pro- cessed in this article considers that this coefficient, noted ao, corresponds to the reliability of the sensor providing the targets.

Thus, the formula 1 must respect the following limit cases conditions:  I,ij =0 (I2(0) - aO Icij = Tl (12(Tl) 0? 'cij = T2 '1(T2) 0? -cij 1 1i(O) = a0  (2)  The first mass set example of the figure 2 is, in fact, a particular case of the second with rTi r2 = or. In this case, r varies between 0 and 1.

. When the index r is fixed at 0.5, the system is in a neutral (impartial) case at the time of the modelling of the distribution of mass.

. When this index is lower than 0.5 then modelling is said as "optimist" because the model tends to allot mass on Hj for a low value of 1cij  . When the index r is higher than 0.5 then modelling is known as "pessimist" because an high index 'cij is need to allot mass on the Hj hypothesis.

In our application, since all targets X are turned over by the same sensor, we consider only one value of r for all the distributions and ao is the same one for all the distributions      0. 7; *  0.63.

too. The value of ao depends of the characterization on the sensor and/or the algorithms of target detection.

In short, each bba is function of the index Ic,j and depends of two parameters ao and r. ao is used as a factor of weakening when the source is unreliable and T tune the partiality of the source.

For the proposed system, we determine 4b and (2 as following:  (D2(Ici) - (I +cos (7rWi))  The choice of such functions (equation 3) is justified by they property of continuity on the suggested intervals.

However this choice was not the subject of a detailed study in this paper. The figure 3 presents different specialized mass set.



IV. MULTI-OBJECTS COMBINATION  A. Extended Open World Royere presents in [11] the extended open world (eow)  concept. In this representation of the world, a new hypoth- esis (initially introduced by Rombaut [10]) is defined and added to the frame of discernment: the hypothesis '*'.

(4)  The frame of discernment (equation 4) is still exhaustive and the hypotheses are always exclusive but the hypothesis '*' allows the consideration of other hypotheses. Thus, we can discriminate the mass m(0) representing the conflict between the experts and the mass m(*) representing a new hypothesis not modelled at the initialisation of the system.

In the traditional open world (ow) representation (proposed by Smets [13]), this distinction can not be done. The sum of these two masses is assumed to be the conflict mass: m(00m) m(0e.w) + m(*)  < B. Generalized Combination Rules  Royere and Gruyer [7] have determined the general bba 9 obtained by the combination of m specialized sources. By  observing the behaviour of the iterative combination with m mass sets, They detected a general behaviour which enables us to express the final mass (equation 5) set according to the initial mass distribution. This enables to compute directly the final masses without any recurrent stage.

Pignistic Repartition and Decision  After having computed the resulting masses thanks to the generalized combination rules, it appears that we have mass on the singleton hypotheses but also on hypotheses disjunction. The pignistic step allows to share the masses of disjunction of hypotheses on singleton hypotheses.

The pignistic probability is build according to a rule similar to Bayesian rule:  P: 2e9 [0,1]  P(A)= , IAnBI m(B) (6) Be2e IBI 1 - m(0) ACB  We can notice that this definition normalizes the proba- bility in order to reduce the conflict effect (1/(1 -rm(0)).

Royere proposes to keep this information which can be useful for the final decision. Recently, Smets proposes a discussion on normalization and decision in [15].

P: 2e -4 [0,1]  IP(A) = IA lBI*m(B) BE2e  B  ACB  P(0) = m(0)  (7)  Some contradictions and/or ambiguities can appear from these two matrices.

An ambiguity occurs, when in a same matrix, there is an  equal probability on the same column. Example: In Mcr, there is an ambiguity for X1 when we have P,,. (Y,) = P,,. (Y.).

A contradiction occurs when the two matrices do not  associate the same objects together. Example: On one hand, in M,,r, P,. (Y,) is the highest probability (X1 is associated with Y1). On the other hand, in MCj, Pi(Xm) is the highest probability (Y1 is associated with Xm). Then, we obtain a contradiction between both decisions.

If such cases appear, in order to solves the contradic- tions and/or ambiguities, Gruyer and Royere assimilate the problem to an assignment problem.

A third matrix (called global pignistic matrix) is built  from the two pignistic matrices, as following:  Mjr Y, . Y, *1...

X1 M1,1 _ Mn P1 . (*) 0  Xm Mm,1 Mm,n O Pm.,(*) *1 P.,1(*) 0 0 0  *n, 0 _ P.,.(*) 0 0 The same scene can be analyzed from two different  points of view (figure 4). The first point of view is looking for the relation between the perceived objects and the known objects. The second one is looking for the relation between the known objects and the perceived objects. Two discernement frames are established:  E). = {X1,.. ,Xm,*} E) = {Y1, * * *, Yn, *}  This leads to the creation of two belief matrices com- posed of pignistic probabilities (using the formula 7):  Mcr Xi ... Xm Y, P1,, (Y,) Pm,. (Y,) ...

Y. P,. (Y.) P..Pm(Yn) * P1,.(*) Pm,. (*) 0 P1,.i(0) Pm,.(0)  with:  Mi= Pi,. (Yi) + P.,3(Xi)- ~~2 Then, this global pignistic matrix is considered as a cost  matrix. They want to find the optimal global association be- tween tracks and targets according to the maximum global belief criteria. The assumption taken is that a target can be associated with only one track and vice versa. To solve this problem, they use the Hungarian algorithm [1], [9] (figure 5). This algorithm has the advantage of ensuring that the decision taken is not "good" but "the best" according to the maximization of the global belief. By the "best", we mean that if we have a known object and a defective sensor, we have few chance to ensure that the association we make is good. But among all the possibility which be to our disposal, we must certify that the decision is the "best" of all possible decisions. Moreover, the maximization of the global belief can cause some local suspicious association.

The final association returns:  Fig. 5. Hungarian Algorithm Representation  Perceived Objects / (Targets)  Sensor  Known Objects (Tracks)  Fig. 6. Scenario example: the system predict four tracks, the sensor returns three targets.

D. Limit of the "Contradictions and Ambiguities Solving Method"  Let us consider the example presented in figure 6. The system knows four objects (Y) and detects three objets (X). The index of agreement is computed from a fuzzy representation of the situation. Then, the bba is generated from this index:  bba for X1 in relation with Yi: mi,i(Yi) = .9  Ml,A(y') = 0 mil(E)) = .1  m1,2(Y2) = 0 mi,3(Y3) = 0 m1,2(Y2) = .6 mi,3(Y3) = .8 mI,2(e) =.4 ml,3(e) = .2  M1,4(y4) = 0 MI,4(V4) =.9 mJ,4(e) = .1  bba for X2 in relation with Yi: M2,1(yl) = .6 M2,1(71) = 0 m2,1(e) = .4  m2,2(y2) = .6 m2,3(y3) = m2,2(Y2) = 0 m2,3(Y3) = .8  m2,2(e) = .4 m2,3(e) = .2  M2,4(y4) = 0 M2,4(F4) = .9 m2,4(0) = *1  bba for X3 in relation with Yi: m3,1(Yl) = 0  m3,1(71) = .6 M3,1(0) = .4  m3,2(Y2) = .9 m3,3(Y3) = 0 m3,2(Y2) = m3,3(Y3) = .7 m3,2 (E) = .1 m3,3 (8) = .3  m3,4(Y4) = 0 m3,4(Y4) = .9 m3,4(8) = .1  The two pignistic matrices are:  Xl X2 X3 * * I1I1 11 1 y1 * Y2 y3 Y4  (8)  It means that: * X1 and X3 are respectively associated with Yi and  Y2.

* X2 appears. It is a new object.

* Y3 and Y4 disappear.

The new frame of discemement is:  9 = {y1, Y2, Y3, Y4,y5,}  Y5 is the new track generated from X2. We notice, that we said that Y3 and Y4 disappear. In fact, we decrease the confidence that we have of the tracks Y3 and Y4. While the confidence is greater than zero, we still keep these tracks and propagate them.

This association maximizes the global belief. In this way, X2 is identified as a new track. In the first matrix, the mass of (X2, *) equals 0.0494 which is only the fourth greatest value and the conflict is great (0.36). The global association leads to a suspicious local association. We can wonder about the significance of taking such a decision. It would be more advisable to consider X2 as a false alarm.

With this simple example, we can see the limit of the algorithm. It generates maybe wrongly some tracks (ghost tracks).



V. MHT BASED ON THE BELIEF THEORY  In the previous section, we showed the limits of the actual "ambiguities and contradiction solving" algorithm.

We remind the assumption taken previously: a target can  be associated with only one track and vice versa. Now, we do not take this assumption anymore and an object can be unassociated. Thus, the system can generate multi- hypotheses or, at the opposite not take a decision.

A. Multi-Hypotheses Generation Strategies  In fact, two strategies have been developed according two different approaches.

Mcr |y1 Y2 y3 Y4 * 0 X1 .9395 .0124 .0059 .0029 .0395 0 X2 .2894 .2894 .0078 .0038 .0494 .36 X3 .0120 .9382 .0088 .0028 .0382 0    1) Cascade Method: The k-level hypotheses are all the disjunctions of k singleton hypotheses.

We notice that the masses are normalized, we lose the  conflict information.

From the highest level (Q), while all the k-level hy-  potheses are less than 0.5, the algorithm spreads pignisticly the mass of the k-level hypotheses on the (k - 1)-level hypotheses and so on.

When the mass of a k-level hypothesis is greater than  0.5, the algorithm propagates the k singleton hypotheses which compose the k-level hypothesis.

Let us consider the following example. We consider E) -{H1, H2, *}. Hi means the target X is in relation with the track Yj, and '*' means X is a new object. After combinaison (formula 5) and normalization, we obtain:  m(Hi) m(H2) m(*)  = .340  m(Hi U H2) m(Hi U *) m(H2 U *) m(Hi U H2 U *)  -0 - .450 -0 - .210  k-level pignistic hypotheses repartition H_ 0.340 0.340 0.635  1 H2 0 0 0.070 __ *______ 0 0 0.295  H1UH2 0 0.070 0 2 H1U* 0.450 0.520 0  H2U* 0 0.070 0  [3 iHUH2 U *]bO.21011 0 0 1 The algorithm starts at the level 3. 0.210 < 0.5, so  the mass is distributed on the 2-level hypotheses. Since the mass on the hypothesis H1 U * equals 0.520 (, 0.5), hypotheses H1 and '*' will be propagated. To know the proportion of each hypothesis, the algorithm finishes the pignistic repartition until the level 1.

It can happen that masses are always lower than 0.5. Let us consider this new example:  Im(Hi) rM(H2) m(*)  .2488  .2488  m(Hi U H2) m(Hi U *) m(H2 U *) |m(Hl U H2 U *)  - .2861 -0 -0 - .2163  [ k-level pignistic hypotheses | repartition  H1 |_0.488_ 0.2488 || 0.4639 | 1 | H2 0.2488 0.2488 0.4639 l ___*__ 0 1 0 10.0721  __HIU_H2_ 0.2861 0.3582 0 2 I 1U* 0 0.0721 0  ___H2U*_ I 0 0.0721 0  |3 IHiUH2U*I0.2163 0 [ 0 In this case, the algorithm can not take any decision. So,  it runs a reversed pignistic repartion. With the initial bba,  the algorithm spread the mass of the level k on the level k + 1.

Remark: In this example, only one target was consider-  ated. Assuming n targets are detected, we must applied n times this algorithm.

2) Threshold Method: The threshold method is a less complex algorithm.

From the two pignistic matrices, we compute a weighted  threshold s (with k8 the weight).

(9) Then, the system keeps only the association with a  pignistic probability greater than the threshold.

As we see in figure 7, the number of validated hy-  potheses is function of the value of k,. If 0.5 < ks < 1 the maximal number of validated hypotheses is 1. If we want a more careful system, we have to validate more hypotheses. Thus, the lower is k5, the bigger is the number of validated hypotheses. If k8 = 0, at least one hypothesis is validated and at the most, all hypotheses are validated.

We notice that the value ks = 0.5 is a particular case.

Indeed, in this case, s represents the half of the non-conflict pignistic probability. So, only one association can verify the inequality P,. (H.) > s.

3) Balance Sheet: Method J Cascade Threshold  Complexity High Low Number of Generated InI  Tracks Accurate Inaccurate Conflict Integration No Yes  B. Decision and New Frame of Discernment At the opposite of previously presented method, the  system tolerates now that some tracks and/or targets are not associated. For the threshold method, if the conflict is too important, we prefer not to make a decision rather to make an error. In addition, the system can associate a target with different tracks. Xi can be associated with Yj and Yk.

It leads to a new frame of discernement with the following "virtuar' targets Yj* and Yi*. It is important to underline the fact that this frame is still exhaustive and hypotheses are still exclusive.

Threshold selection: the graphic assess the number of hypotheses maximal and minimal which could be propagated. The example is taken with a frame of discernment composed offive singleton hypotheses. This template is used to gauging the weight k8.

C. Example  Let us consider again the example presented in the section IV-D. We solve this time the problem with the threshold method. We remind the two and we add s computed with k, = 0.5.

The final association is:  X1 X2 X3 * *  lY1 Y2 Y314 (10)  We notice that X2 is not associated to any Yj. It is not taken into account, considered as a false alarm. But, ignoring X2 is, a priori, a too rough approximation. On the other hand, if we consider the weight k5 = 0.4, the two pignistic matrices with the computed threshold become:  (1 1)  With a lower threshold, X2 is associated with Y1 and Y2. Therefore, the new frame of discernement become:  y-{Y1, Y2, Y21, Y22, Y3,Y4,*}  Y2*1 and Y22 are two virtual objects. Theses new tracks are more "powerful" than the track 15 set previously. They correspond to pre-initialized tracks.

The target X2 seems to belong at the same time to Y1 and  Y2. We can, for instance, easily imagine something (a box for instance) which falls from the vehicle Y, (respectively Y2). If such is the case, during the next association step, a new target will be associate with Y2*1 (respectively Y2*2).

Then, naturally, the confidence of the track will increase.



VI. ELIMINATION OF THE NONCONSISTENT TRACKS OF THE TRACKING TREE  When a star is associated with a track (* Y1), we remind that the Yj is not removed. The track is propagated and its confidence is decreased. At the opposite, if the track Yj is associated with a target, its confidence is increased.

The figure 8 shows the operation of propagation with a basic function. It is easily to see that the lifespan depends of the function. We want to have the choice between several template curves in order to tune the lifespan of the propagated hypotheses. Gruyer proposes to dilate the straight line of the previous figure according to Bezier function (figure 9). Then, a specific curve is selected, depending on the sophistication of the tracking we want.



VII. OPERATION MODES: INTERNAL AND INFORMATIVE  In the proposed system, we distinguish two kinds of decision (figure 10).

. Informative procedure: in this case, the decision taken by the system is dedicated to higher levels (Col- lision avoidance algorithm, human awareness ... ).

The system returns only the associations with single propositions.

. Internal procedure: the system returns a decision dedi- cated for its internal processing. Therefore, it can work with the multi-associations (Y*) tree.

VIII. CONCLUSION  We have presented the Gruyer and Royere framework.

This tool allows to realize a tracking with a management of tracks appearance and disappearance. In this framework, the decision is taken according to a global belief criteria.

This decision is good when the conflict is weak, but if it is not the case, some local suspicious associations can appear.

We present in this article, a method based on a MHT approach to avoid these suspicious associations. Two tree generation strategies have been developed. The proposed system allows to filter the false alarms. Thus, the higher levels are not aware of these false alarms but, by an internal MHT treatment, the system keeps the suspicious targets and analyzes them in the time with the use of virtual objects.
