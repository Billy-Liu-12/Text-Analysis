INVESTIGATION OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PD MEASURED WITH RF  TECHNIQUES AND APPARENT CHARGE QUANTITY OF METAL PROTRUSION IN AIR

Abstract: Radical frequency (RF) measurement has become hot point in field of partial discharge detection. However, a big problem that hampers the application of this method is difficult to establish a relationship between data from RF measurement and apparent discharge quantity, that is, use RF signal to estimate the apparent discharge. In this paper, on the basis of the experiment model of metal protrusion, the relationship between RF measurement and pulse current method (IEC60270) was investigated. The relationship curves of energy, double integration, peak voltage, peak-peak voltage, area of the RF signal relative to apparent discharge quantity or the square of apparent discharge quantity were plotted and the optimal regression curve was found out. At the same time, the impacts of voltage and the distance between protrusion and plate were investigated as well. The results indicate that the optimal regression curve is energy of RF signal relative to square of apparent discharge quantity. The variation of voltage has no impact on the regression curve, that is, data from different voltage regress to one line. However, while the distance between protrusion and plate is changed, the slope of regression curve changes according to it and the same energy is corresponding to bigger discharge quantity. The results are valuable to be applied in the field of estimation of the discharge quantity of RF partial discharge signal.

1. INTRODUCTION  AS failures that occur in electrical equipment often result from electrical breakdown in the insulation material, this may occur because of insulation damage caused by the cumulative adverse effects of partial discharge (PD) events.

Recognizing PD activity in electrical equipment is important because early detection can allow preventative measures to be taken so that costly failures can be avoided or reduced. PD measurements have long been recognized as an important tool to detect insulation faults [1].

Two effective PD measurement methods are conventional measurements as defined in IEC Standard 60270 and radio frequency (RF) techniques [2-4]. Several studies have investigated an estimation of charge quantity of PD by RF method based on the relationship between PD-induced electromagnetic wave and charge quantity of PD according to IEC60270 [5]. Japanese specialist Shinya Ohtsuka investigated the relationship between charge quantity of partial discharge in GIS and PD-induced electromagnetic wave measured with ultra high frequency ?UHF? method. The results indicate that value of double integral of PD-induced electromagnetic wave's TEM mode component, is basically proportional to the charge quantity of PD current pulse independently of the sensor distance from PD source and the PD current pulse's shape. Namely, PD charge quantity can be basically corrected and evaluated by UHF method [6].

G.P. Cleary and M.D. Judd investigated the UHF and current pulse of partial discharge activity in mineral oil.

The conclusion is that the relationship between the energy of RF signal and square of charge quantity is linear. Other researches, such as [3], combining RF and IEC60270 techniques to diagnose the insulation defect of HV plant or discriminate discharge type  In this paper, on the basis of the experiment model of metal protrusion in air, the relationship between RF measurement and pulse current method was investigated.

The relationship curves of energy, double integration, peak voltage, peak-peak voltage, area of the RF signal vs.

apparent discharge quantity or the square of apparent discharge quantity were plotted and the optimal regression curve was found out. At the same time, the impacts of voltage and the distance between protrusion and plate were investigated as well.

2. EXPERIMENTS  A  Measurement system Figure 1 shows the measurement system is used to measure PD by IEC60270 and RF techniques. The metal protrusion is arranged in air as PD source and it is located at the HV electrode. The distance between metallic protrusion and the plate is 10, 15, 20mm. measurement system concludes an induction voltage regulator, a testing transformer, a dividing capacitor, a RF sensor (microstrip patch antenna), a coupling capacitance and a detecting impedance. The distance between sensor and test unit is 30cm.

B  Tools for analyzing acquired data quantitatively In order to determine the relationship between RF signal and its apparent charge quantity, we calculate the amplitude value, peak-peak value, area, energy, double integral of RF signal and the square of apparent charge quantity. The energy of RF signal could be calculated by formula 1.

? ?= i  iRF VR tE 2               ?1?  Where Vi is voltage of the ith sampling point, R is the load impedance. The marching way of measurement system is DC 50?, so the value of R is 50?. Because the sampling rate is 2.5GSa/s, the value of t ? is 0.4ns.

Regression analysis was applied to all data, so coefficient of determination R2 was used to analyze the regression quantitatively. Coefficient of determination is an important index in field of statistical test that used to verify reliability of regression equations and determine the regression level of data. Generally speaking, it is used to estimate the distance between samples and regression line.

The value of coefficient of determination ranges from 0 to +1, the bigger value means the better regression. Namely, the variation of the dependent variable is the results of the change of independent variable.

SSR is regression sum of  squares, which represents the influence degree of independent variable on dependent variable. SST is total sum of squares, which indicates the total dispersion between all observed values and their mean value.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS  A The relationship between RF signal and apparent charge quantity in positive half cycle The simplest relationship is amplitude or peak-peak value of RF signal relative to apparent charge quantity.

Since the background noise (white noise) in lab is about ?2mV, the error of acquired RF signals is about several millivolt. This type of error would increase the data dispersivity and decrease the value of coefficient of determination. Figure 2a shows relationship of amplitude (max) and peak-peak (pp) value of RF signal relative to apparent charge quantity.

However, background noise is random noise, for a signal with the length of several thousand nanoseconds, the mean influence on the whole signal tends to zero. Therefore, we calculate the area of RF signal to eliminate the error due to background noise. Figure 2b shows relationship of area of  RF signal relative to apparent charge quantity. Coefficients of determination are list in table 1. Linearity of data in Figure 2b is better than that of in Figure 2a.

The relationship between energy and apparent charge quantity are shown in Figure 2c. From the Figure and data in table 1 we could know the relationship is not linear but square-law. For linear regression, the value of coefficient of determination is 0.9734, but 0.9791 for regression of square-law.

It is reported that PD current pulse in       the time-domain plays a critical role in determining the amount of UHF energy received by each sensor. If the PD current varies only in amplitude from one pulse to another, the relationship between energy and charge quantity could be determined. The deduction of this theory is as follows:  V is the voltage output from the RF sensor, ERF is the energy of RF signal, q is charge quantity, E is the RF electric field incident on the sensor, i is the PD current and Ip is the peak values of i.

(1) V?E, because RF sensor is a passive, linear device.

(2) E is a function of di/dt. Because PD current pulses vary only in amplitude from one pulse to another, di/dt will scale proportionally with Ip. Therefore, if the pulse amplitude doubles, so will the amplitude of the radiated field.

(3) Ip?q. Because pulses have constant shape, the peak amplitude must be proportional to the charge content, so that Ip?q.

Therefore, V?q has been verified. Since calculating the energy content of the RF signal involves squaring the voltage V, the energy relationship for a repeatable PD source becomes ERF?q2.

From Figure 3, it could be concluded that there is a linear relationship between energy and square of charge quantity and the effects of noise are smaller than that of pp and max.

Square of ap parent charg e qu antity/pC2  En er  gy /J     Figure 3: Energy relative to square of apparent charge  quantity    In Shinya Ohtsuka?s theory, there is a linear relationship between double integral of RF signal and charge quantity [6]. The deduction of this theory is as follows:  (1) In electromagnetism theory, electromagnetic wave is induced by PD current pulse and its peak-peak value Vpp relates to the current changing rate di/dt of discharge current pulse. Namely, peak-peak value is determined by the current changing rates of the rise and fall part of PD current pulse.

(2) Therfore, Vpp depends on the rise and fall time tr and tf as well as the peak value I. Thus, Vpp does not relate linearly to PD charge quantity.

(3) Charge quantity could be calculated by integral of PD current pulse and the waveform of RF is determined by current changing rate di/dt. Therfore, the value of double integral of PD-induced electromagnetic wave is proportional to the charge quantity of PD current pulse.

From Figure 3, it could be concluded that effects of noise are smaller than that of pp and max as well,.

It is concluded that linear relationship does exist between energy of RF signal and square of apparent charge quantity.

B  The relationship under different voltage In this section, we investigate that when the voltage changes, how relationship between energy of RF signal and square of apparent charge quantity changes with it. Figure 5 shows relationships under 7.0kV, 9.0kV and 10.0kV. We find that with the increase of voltage, energy of RF signals increase. Moreover, data from different voltage regress to an identical line.

C The relationship under different distance between protrusion and plate The variety of distance between protrusion and plate means the variety of PD source. In theory, the PD current pulse and RF signal will change with it. Therefore, the relationship between energy of RF signal and square of apparent will be changed. The relationships under different distances between protrusion and plate are shown in Figure 6. It shows that when the distance is 20 or 15mm, the relationship is still linear though the slope of regression line is different. However, when the distance is decreased to 10mm, the PD phenomena start to change and the linear       relationship is not clear though energy of RF signal still increase with apparent charge quantity. The value of coefficient of determination for distances of 10?15? 20mm is 0.7801, 0.9859 and 0.9623 respective.

CONCLUSIONS  In this paper, we investigate the relationship between RF signal and apparent charge quantity.  Figure 5: Relationship between energy of RF signal and  apparent under different voltage The results indicate that there is a linear relationship  between RF signal and apparent charge quantity in positive half cycle. Moreover, the best regression curve with the biggest value of coefficient of determination is energy of RF signal relative to square of apparent discharge quantity.

The variation of voltage has no impact on the regression curve, that is, data from different voltages regress to a same line. However, while the distance between protrusion and plate is changed, the slope of regression curve changes according to it and the same energy is corresponding to bigger discharge quantity.

D  PD in negative half cycle We know that the PD phenomena and the waveform of RF signal are different in positive and negative half cycle.

Therefore, the relationship of RF signal and apparent charge quantity will be different.

Stewar et al, ?Correlation between RF energy and IEC60270 apparent charge for selected partial discharge source geometries?, In 15th International Symposium on High Voltage Engineering, 2007.   Relationship between amplitude of RF signal and  apparent charge quantity under distances of 10, 15, 20mm are shown in Figure 7. The test voltage is 7.0kV. We find that the law is very different from it in positive half cycle.

First, apparent charge quantity is much smaller in identical testing condition. In general, it is less than 100pC. Second, there is not any regression curve could describe the relationship. The only relationship could be concluded is that apparent charge quantity increases with decrease of distances between protrusion and plate.For a certain PD source with invariable distance between protrusion and plate, like PD in positive half cycle, apparent charge quantity increase with increase of testing voltage, but there is no linear relationship as well.
