Attribute Relationship Evaluation Methodology for  Big Data Security

Abstract?There has been an increasing interest in big data and big data security with the development of network technology and cloud computing. However, big data is not an entirely new technology but an extension of data mining. In this paper, we describe the background of big data, data mining and big data features, and propose attribute selection methodology for protecting the value of big data. Extracting valuable information is the main goal of analyzing big data which need to be protected. Therefore, relevance between attributes of a dataset is a very important element for big data analysis. We focus on two things. Firstly, attribute relevance in big data is a key element for extracting information. In this perspective, we studied on how to secure a big data through protecting valuable information inside. Secondly, it is impossible to protect all big data and its attributes. We consider big data as a single object which has its own attributes. We assume that a attribute which have a higher relevance is more important than other attributes.

I. INTRODUCTION Several new technologies have emerged with the  development of network technology and distributed computing. Because of IT technology and the Internet, tremendous amount of digital information is produced and distributed every day. As a result, efforts to extract information from large-scale information are being accelerated. It is generally agreed today that big data and cloud are major trend of modern computer technology [7].

Danah Boyd et. al. [10] presented that modern society is the era of big data. Experts commonly say that ?Big data? is a technique to extract the value from huge data beyond the processing capabilities of existing databases. Big data is used in a variety of ways in different areas such as US health care, Europe public sector administration and global personal location data [8]. Moreover, value is extracted from the big data in a variety ways. Among those, data mining techniques are mainly used. It is difficult to explain the big data without mentioning data mining. It is generally thought that big data has a close relationship with data mining [7, 9]. Requirements for extending capabilities of data mining have been resolved through other technologies. From that stand point, big data is  not a whole new technology. Furthermore, it could be said that big data security issues have close relation with data mining.

Primary goal of big data is extracting value from the large amount of data. This implies that value extracted from big data the target that should be protected with the highest priority and attribute of dataset is an essential source for creating value inside a big data.

Intuitively, it is not possible to protect all the data inside the big data. Therefore, methodology of selecting attributes that should be protected is needed for security of big data. For this purpose, we propose a ranking algorithm that prioritizes attributes for big data security. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we introduce the background of big data and its features. We describe a security concept on big data and propose targets that must be protected in section 3. We propose methodology that selects attributes for protecting value of big data in section 4. Lastly, we make conclusion and future work in section 5.



II. BACKGROUND  A. Data Mining Data Mining is commonly defined as the technique to extract  useful knowledge from database [4]. It is almost impossible to derive the value directly from each data. For this reason, data mining needs pre-processing and analytic method for finding the value. Indeed, data mining is closely related with artificial intelligence and machine learning and so on [6]. Scale of data management in data mining and big data is significantly different in size. However, the basic method to extract the value is very similar. In case of data mining, the process of extracting knowledge needs data cleaning, data integration, data selection, data transformation, data mining, pattern evaluation, knowledge presentation et. [6]. Big data came out after solving the requirements and challenges of data mining.

Requirements and challenges are ?handling of different types of data?, ?efficiency and scalability of data mining algorithms?, ?mining information from different source of data? [4].

B. Data Mining Analysis     Analytic method of data mining can be classified in several ways depending on the point of view. In this paper, we classified analytic methods of data mining into four techniques based on the concept, considering the relevance with big data as follows:   ? Classification: Classification is the process of arranging  a specific object in set of categories, based on the each concept attributes [6]. Data classification consists of two-step process. The first step building a data model and determining data classes in advance using training sample. This step is also referred to as supervised learning. The next step classifies the dataset using model or classifier as determined by class label attributes [12].

? Prediction: Classification and prediction are the most commonly used mining techniques and have a lot in common. The main difference between two methods can be described as follows: Prediction predicts continuous value whereas classification predicts discrete value like class label [12].

? Clustering: Clustering also can be explained based on classification. Classification is done by learning the samples in advance, whereas clustering defines a class without a prior learning to classify data [12]. Clustering is the process of grouping data which have multiple properties based on similar attributes without pre- defined criteria.

? Association Rule Discovery: Association rule discovery is the process of finding interesting relationship or correlation among databases [6]. Interesting relationship means useful patterns or frequent item sets.

Typically used algorithm is the Apriori algorithm [6].

Because the word ?useful? is a subjective meaning, useful value differs depending on user's purpose or environment and so on. This is commonly used in service fields. Also it is often described by beer and diaper correlation [12].

As you can see, attribute information is the key element for analytic techniques of data mining. In case of big data, it uses more various attributes for extracting value than data mining.

Fig. 1 Analytic Techniques of Data Mining    C. Major Features of Big data and Related Techniques  Normally, the features of big data are expressed in 3Vs.

3Vs indicates volume, velocity and variety. Volume means large scale of data and velocity is related to performance of big data processing, while variety stands for various data types.

Big data handles large amount of data beyond the legacy databases and utilizes various types of data including unstructured data and attributes that were never used in the past [8]. These features distinguish data mining from big data.

Relational database management systems (RDBMS) use SQL(Structured Query Language) and focus on the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Integrity and Durability). Data management policy of classical DBMS is strict because RDBMS has been mainly used in the financial sector. On the other hand, big data covers many different data types. Thus Big data emphasize BASE(Basic Availability, Soft- state, and Eventual consistent) properties rather than ACID [9]. In addition to this, big data use NoSQL database. Various frameworks and file systems have been developed for managing and analyzing big data. Typical common examples are MapReduce, Hadoop and NoSQL.

Google introduced MapReduce framework in 2004. It is a programming model for processing and producing large datasets [5]. MapReduce is composed of two processes, which are Map(simple computation) and Reduce(integration)[13].

Hadoop is an acronym for High-Availability Distributed Object-Oriented Platform and is an open source implementation of MapReduce [9]. HDFS(Hadoop Distributed File System) is a distributed file system for the Hadoop framework. NoSQL is a technique for handling data which is difficult to handle with traditional SQL.



III.  BIG DATA SECURITY USING ATTRIBUTES  A. Big data Security Overview As increasing use of big data and expanding scope of big  data, big data security has been considered crucial. There are many security issues about big data. Among them, data protection and access control are recognized as the most important security issue [1, 2]. This is similar to the current information security situation. However, data management and classification for security are more difficult than current information security issues due to the volume of data[3]. For this reason, Management Cost per GB has decreased but security investment for big data has increased [2]. Similarly, access control is more difficult due to huge data scale. As mentioned earlier in the introduction, value is the key deliverable of big data. The data itself is not the subject of protection. In addition, securing the entire data is very inefficient, considering the volume of big data. There are several ways to protect the value. In this paper, we focus on the attribute of big data. With this in mind, we propose the attribute selection methodology for big data security.
