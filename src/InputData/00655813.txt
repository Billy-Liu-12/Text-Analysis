Abstract Association rules are useful for determining corre-  lations between attributes of a relation and have appli- cations in marketing, ?nancial and retail sectors. Fur- thermore, optimized association rules are an e?ective way to focus on the most interesting characteristics in- volving certain attributes. Optimized association rules are permitted to contain uninstantiated attributes and the problem is to determine instantiations such that ei- ther the support or con?dence of the rule is maximized.

In this paper, we generalize the optimized associa- tion rules problem in three ways { 1) association rules are allowed to contain disjunctions over uninstantiated attributes, 2) association rules are permitted to contain an arbitrary number of uninstantiated attributes, and 3) uninstantiated attributes can be either categorical or numeric. Our generalized association rules enable us to extract more useful information about seasonal and local patterns involving multiple attributes. We present e?ective techniques for pruning the search space when computing optimized association rules for both categor- ical and numeric attributes. Finally, we report the re- sults of our experiments that indicate that our pruning algorithms are e?cient for a large number of uninstan- tiated attributes, disjunctions and values in the domain of the attributes.

1 Introduction Association rules, introduced in [1], provide a useful  mechanism for discovering correlations among the un- derlying data. In its most general form, an association rule can be viewed as being de?ned over attributes of a relation, and has the form C1 ! C2, where C1 and C2 are conjunctions of conditions, and each condition is either Ai = vi or Ai 2 [li; ui] (vi, li and ui are values from the domain of the attribute Ai). Each rule has an associated support and con?dence. Let the support of a condition Ci be the ratio of the number of tuples satisfying Ci and the number of tuples in the relation.

The support of a rule of the form C1 ! C2 is then the same as the support of C1 ^ C2, while its con?dence is the ratio of the supports of conditions C1 ^C2 and C1. The association rules problem is that of comput- ing all association rules that satisfy user-speci?ed min- imum support and minimum con?dence constraints, and schemes for this can be found in [1, 2, 6, 10, 11].

For example, consider a relation in a telecom ser- vice provider database that contains call detail infor- mation. The attributes of the relation are date, time, src city, src country, dst city, dst country and duration.

A single tuple in the relation thus captures informa- tion about the two endpoints of each call, as well as the temporal elements of the call. The association rule (src city = NY) ! (dst country = France) would sat- isfy the user-speci?ed minimum support and minimum con?dence of 0.05 and 0.3, respectively, if at least 5% of total calls are from NY to France, and at least 30% of the calls that originated from NY are to France.

The optimized association rules problem, motivated by applications in marketing and advertising, was in- troduced in [5]. An association rule R has the form (A1 2 [l1; u1]) ^ C1 ! C2, where A1 is a numeric at- tribute, l1 and u1 are uninstantiated variables, and C1 and C2 contain only instantiated conditions (that is, the conditions do not contain uninstantiated vari- ables). The authors propose algorithms for determin- ing values for the uninstantiated variables l1 and u1 for each of the following cases:  ? Con?dence of R is maximized and support of the condition (A1 2 [l1; u1]) ^C1 is at least the user- speci?ed support (referred to as the optimized con- ?dence rule).

? Support of the condition (A1 2 [l1; u1]) ^ C1 is maximized and con?dence ofR is at least the user- speci?ed con?dence (referred to as the optimized support rule).

Optimized association rules are useful for unravel- ing ranges for numeric attributes where certain trends or correlations are strong (that is, have high support or con?dence). For example, suppose the telecom ser- vice provider mentioned earlier was interested in of- fering a promotion to NY customers who make calls to France. In this case, the timing of the promotion may be critical { for its success, it would be advanta- geous to o?er it close to a period of consecutive days in which at least a certain minimum number of calls from NY are made and the percentage of calls from NY to France is maximum. The framework devel- oped in [5] can be used to determine such periods.
