Impact of the traffic load on performance of

Abstract-Although many countries only now begin to invest in  deployment of GSM-Railways (GSM-R) networks, this technology  is already obsolete and reveals its significant shortcomings. The  most troublesome one is the insufficient number of communication  channels offered by GSM-R. This is a major problem obstructing  railway operations at big train stations and junctions. Hence, other  technologies, such as Long Term Evolution (L TE), need to be  considered as an alternative to GSM-R. The goal of this paper is to  demonstrate the capacity increase that railways can expect, from  the introduction of L TE as internal communication infrastructure  supporting railway signaling. This work is based on OPNET  realistic network simulations, which show the relation between the  traffic load (the number of trains transmitting and receiving data  in an LTE cell) and the delay performance of the European Train  Control System (ETCS) signaling, which is one of the essential  railway communication services. Results of the simulations  demonstrate that LTE can solve the urgent capacity problem faced  by railways currently deploying GSM-R.

I. INTRODUCTION  GSM-R, which is a part of The European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS), is one of the dominant communication networks for railways. Its popularity is growing across Europe and other places around the world, where it gradually substitutes legacy national railway communication technologies [I], [2]. GSM-R is designed to provide two essential railway services: transmission of the European Train Control System (ETCS) messages and internal voice communication for railways. ETCS system provides in-cab signaling and train movement supervision. Thanks to these features, ETCS reduces the risk of train driver error. Moreover, it allows increasing the track occupancy [I].

Most of the deployed GSM-R networks were initially used only to provide railway voice communication. However, as more of these GSM-R networks begin to support ETCS signaling, the capacity of GSM-R turns out to be insufficient. GSM-R offers too little user traffic channels. Due to this, in some railway areas such as main train stations, there may be not enough GSM-R channels to provide the required ETCS connectivity for all the trains [3], [4]. This means that the number of GSM-R channels may become the element limiting the number of trains operating   in a given area. Desirably, the only limitation should be related to the capacity of the railway infrastructure, not the capacity of the communication infrastructure. The insufficient capacity of GSM-R has few sources: the underlying circuit switched transmission paradigm, an inflexible resource sharing and the narrow band of radio spectrum assigned for railways.

In order to overcome this problem some railway companies implement special operational rules, e.g.: train drivers are required to tum off GSM-R radio while they are at a longer stop [3]. However, these solutions are impractical and do not solve the capacity problem entirely. Besides, they make the train driving and supervising procedures unnecessarily complicated and prone to error. This is why, the GSM-R capacity problem cannot be solved without introducing new, more efficient and capable mobile technology, such as L TE. L TE offers many improvements over GSM-R [5]. These improvements should address all the major shortcomings of GSM-R in terms of capacity and data transmission capabilities. Details on the benefits of L TE in the railway environment were described in one of our previous papers [6].

In this paper, we demonstrate the communication capacity increase, which railways can expect from the introduction of L TE. The aim of our work is to explicitly show that L TE can offer sufficient capacity to provide ETCS connectivity at busy train stations, such as Copenhagen Main Train Station. This demonstration has to be done, because in the railway industry, GSM-R is still the state-of-the-art technology and its shortcomings are belittled. Hence, practical benefits of L TE as a railway communication technology (such as the increased capacity solving the capacity problem) have to be explicitly shown to in order to explain the convenience for migration from GSM-R.

The paper is organized as follows. Section II describes railway requirements on communication performance. Section III presents specific communication requirements at Copenhagen Main Train Station, which is then used as a basis for simulation scenarios. Section IV presents the proposed simulation scenario and the underlying assumptions. Section V presents simulation results concerning the relation between the traffic load and performance of ETCS signaling. Finally, section VI contains conclusions of the paper.



II. RAILWAY COMMUNICATION REQUIREMENTS  To ensure the connectivity between a Radio Block Controller (REC) and On-Board Units (OBUs) in trains is a requirement to enable ETCS signaling. The RBC is an ETCS server supervising train movement, and each OBU is an ETCS element located in every train locomotive. OBUs are connected over a dedicated railway mobile communication network. In our analysis this network is based on L TE. The RBC is connected via a fixed wired network.

The International Union of Railways (UIC) defined a set of specific ETCS transmission requirements concerning the OBU? RBC connectivity, which need to be fulfilled by the railway communication network [1]. These requirements are defined for circuit-switched based transmission of ETCS messages as it is the case in GSM-R. Hence, there is a need to redefine these requirements for packet-switched based case as in LTE. This redefinition is not finalized, but the Danish Signaling Program published tentative requirements for packet-switched based ETCS signaling, which concern parameters such as [3]:  1. Data transfer delay between OBU and RBC.

The mean transfer delay of 128 byte ETCS message is required to be lower than 0.5 s. Moreover, 95% of the ETCS messages have to be delivered within 1.5 s.

2. Data integrity (probability of packets loss, corruption, out-of-sequence delivery, etc.).

3. Received radio signal power.

4. Network procedures delay.

The performance of L TE transmissions depends, among other, on the number of User Equipment (UEs) in an L TE cell. In the herein presented model for an L TE railway communication network, each train carrying an OBU is considered as an UE. In order to find the number of trains that can be served by a single L TE cell, it is first necessary to find the relation between the number of trains (UEs) in the L TE cell and the performance of the OBU-RBC connection. Only then, it is possible to find the highest number of trains (UEs) the cell can serve.



III. COPENHAGEN MAIN TRAIN STATION COMMUNICATION REQUIREMENTS  The capacity analysis is done on an example of Copenhagen Main Train Station. This train station has been chosen, because it  is the biggest train station in Denmark, with the highest train concentration. Moreover, it is an area where GSM-R network may offer insufficient capacity to serve all the trains [3]. Hence, it has to be proven that L TE can solve this capacity problem.

According to the analysis by the national railway infrastructure manager Banedanmark [3], the following number of ETCS connections is expected at Copenhagen Main Station:  ? 12 ETCS connections at the platform tracks.

? 34 ETCS connections on the 5 km track section from Copenhagen Main Station towards Helgoland.

? 20 ETCS connections on the 5 km track section from Copenhagen Main Station towards H0je Taastrup.

? 20 ETCS connections on the 5 km track section from Copenhagen Main Station towards Kastrup.

Figure I schematically illustrates the situation at Copenhagen Main Train Station.

In our analysis, there is a single mobile cell at Copenhagen Main Station, which covers the platform tracks and the station approach tracks. The station is covered with only one cell, because a train station is an area where the train movement has to be most precisely controlled. In case of multi-cell deployment, the inter-cell handovers would introduce additional disruptions in ETCS transmissions. Thus, it is recommended by the UIC to avoid inter-cell handovers within a train station.

Assuming that the radio base station is located in the center of Copenhagen Main Station, the radio cell has to have a radius of approximately 1 km in order to cover the platform tracks and the approach tracks from all of the three directions. In the 1 km cell, the total number of expected ETCS connections is a sum of the expected connections at the platform tracks and the expected connections at the approach tracks within the cell radius. The previously mentioned Banedanmark report [3] considers 5 km track sections towards Helgoland, H0je Taastrup and Kastrup.

From each of these 5 km track sections only 1 km of tracks will lie within the 1 km radio cell. In our analysis, it is assumed that trains are uniformly distributed on these 5 km track sections.

Therefore, the number of trains is proportional to the track length. Thus, the expected number of ETCS connections at the I km approach tracks will be only 1/5 of the expected connections listed in the Banedanmark report [3]. Summing up,  27 ETCS connections within the 1 km cell  .-------------.

In the future, until year 2030, the number of trains arriving and departing from Copenhagen Main Train Station in a rush hour is expected to increase by approximately 45% [7].

Assuming that the demand for ETCS connections will increase proportionally to the increase of trains per hour, the 1 km cell will have to provide approximately 40 simultaneous ETCS connections. GSM-R cell can only provide approximately 23 ETCS connections as derived in [8].



IV. SIMULATION MODEL  A. Simulation goal  The goal of the simulations is to investigate the relation between the traffic load (number of trains transmitting and receiving over LTE railway communication network) and the transfer delay performance of ETCS signaling. This relation will answer the question how many trains can be served by a single LTE cell.

B. L TE coverage  In our model, the Copenhagen Main Station is covered with an L TE network, which provides connectivity between the trains and the application servers. Each train is considered as an L TE User Equipment (UE). Our analysis considers only a single L TE cell (single eNodeB) covering the whole station. Therefore, all of the UEs are connected to the same eNodeB. The eNodeB is connected to Evolved Packet Core (EPC) node, which in the OPNET model provides functionality of all the L TE backbone nodes. Moreover, EPC also provides connectivity with the application servers.

Within the whole cell area, the Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) measured by the mobile nodes remains above -92 dBm (with 95% coverage probability) as stated in the ETCS requirements [3]. In reality, the tracks north from the station are hidden in a tunnel, while in our model the tunnel is neglected assuming that the signal coverage is provided there by a proper mechanism.

In our model, there are two additional neighboring L TE cells, which provide network coverage over nearby railway tracks. The purpose of the neighboring cells, which operate in the same frequency as the analyzed cell, is to introduce a realistic level of interference.

The modeled L TE cell operates in a 5 MHz spectrum. L TE supports lA, 3, 5, 10, 15 and 20 MHz bandwidths [5]. The 5 MHz bandwidth has been chosen as it is the one closest to the size of GSM-R bandwidths used in Europe, where GSM-R operates in 4 or 7 MHz bandwidths [1].

A schematic overview of the modeled L TE cell is shown in Figure 2.

C. Railway applications  Currently, GSM-R networks are used mainly for providing ETCS signaling and voice communication (interphone).

However, in the case of an L TE railway communication network, many other services could be provided. This is because, L TE offers much higher capacity than GSM-R. Thus, in our model, a bigger set of applications is considered. In the description of the applications the term "downlink" is used to address the communication from one of the application servers towards a train. On the other hand, the term "uplink" addresses opposite direction - from a train towards one of the application servers.

This application mix, which is described in details in the following subsections, is based on the application mix proposed in [10].

1) ETCS signalling As mentioned previously, ETCS is a fundamental service for  railways. Each OBU sends an ETCS message to the RBC at time intervals following an exponential distribution with a mean value of 30 s. Also the RBC sends an ETCS message to each of the OBUs at time intervals following an exponential distribution with a mean value of 30 s. These time values are based on the assumption that a movement authority and a position update messages are transferred every half a minute, on average. ETCS messages have a constant size of 128 bytes according to the size specified in the ETCS requirements [3]. Each message is acknowledged with a message of equal size. In fact, the size of ETCS message varies and is usually smaller, thus, the 128-byte message size can be considered as the worst-case scenario.

2) Inter phone Voice communication (internal railway telephony) is still an  essential service for railways. In the model, each train driver maintains a continuous voice call with a traffic control center (modeled as another application server). The application generates uplink and downlink streams with bitrate of 64 Kbps.

Note, that this and all the following applications generate data in a continuous manner in our model. Although in reality voice calls (and other applications) will not be used continuously, in our model the usage pattern is continuous in order to simulate the worst-case situation when all the services are accessed simultaneously.

3) File update File update is used by on-board equipment to receive updates  and information (not safety-critical). The application generates 1000 Kbps downlink stream.

4) Voice announcements Voice announcements are used to inform on-board passengers  about the current traffic situation. These announcements are transmitted from the train control center (another application server) to each of the trains. The application generates a 64 Kbps downlink stream.

5) CCTV CCTV is used for monitoring the train interior for safety  purposes. The CCTV application generates 2000 Kbps uplink stream. Due to the limited radio band of 5 MHz, only three video streams are transmitted simultaneously from three selected trains.

6) Discreet listening Discreet listening is used to monitor the situation in every  train using an audio transmission. This is done for security purposes. The application generates a 64 Kbps uplink stream.

D. QoS configuration  The applications listed above can be divided into three groups in terms of their importance for railway operation:  1. Safety-critical applications (ETCS). ETCS ensures safety and efficiency of train movement. Thus, it has to receive the highest priority in the network and its transmission cannot be obstructed by any other applications.

2. Applications essential for railway operation (Interphone).

Interphone is an important application necessary in many railway operational procedures, such as the Railway Emergency Call (REC).

3. Railway applications which are not necessary for train movement (CCTV, voice announcements, discreet listening, file update). These applications are useful for railways, but are not needed to maintain train operation.

In order to ensure correct prioritization of the applications in a shared L TE network, the standard L TE bearer-based QoS [5] mechanism is employed. Using this mechanism, three bearers types are defined - one for each of the application categories presented above. The details of the chosen configuration are shown in Table I .

Train distribution  Trains (UEs) are stationary and are distributed along the station tracks following a Gaussian distribution with the highest concentration in the center of the station. Moreover, there is an additional group of trains located south from the station in a big shunting yard.

F. Simulation scenarios  Based on the presented assumptions a set of simulation scenarios was prepared. The scenarios differ only by the number of trains (UEs): from 5 to 75. Each scenario was executed 15 times with different seed numbers. Each simulation scenario lasted 30 min. An upper limit of 75 trains at the station was chosen, although Copenhagen Main Station will not accommodate more than 40 trains as calculated in section III.

This was done to check the model behavior at higher load.



V. SIMULATION RESULTS  A. LTE channel utilization  Figure 3 shows the results of the utilization of the LTE physical shared channels in relation to the number of trains active in the modeled L TE cell. This relation will be used for   90 ? .. 80 Cii c c C1I ? .c 70 u  'C I!! C1I 60 .c .. ? ? ..

interpretation of the following results concerning transfer delays.

As it can be seen in the figure, when the number of trains reached 35, utilization of the Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH) saturated at approximately 90%. This means that, in scenarios with more than 35 trains, the offered uplink traffic exceeded the uplink capacity. On the other hand, utilization of the Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH) reached 90% value only when 75 trains were active in the cell. It should be noted that this high utilization was mainly due to the non-ETCS applications.

The utilization would grow much slower if the cell would carry only ETCS signaling and voice communication traffic, as it is the case in GSM-R. The most significant contributors to the traffic are CCTV and file transfer applications. However, theses do not affect the ETCS signaling performance as described in the following subsection.

B. ETCS transfer delay  Figure 4 shows the relation between the recorded mean transfer delay of ETCS messages and the number of trains active in the simulated cell. Uplink and downlink cases are shown separately. As expected, the more trains were active (transmitting) in the cell, the larger was the mean transfer delay of ETCS messages. Looking at the downlink, the mean transfer delay increased from 0.015 s in the 5-train scenario to 0.023 s in the 75-train scenario. Similarly, looking at the uplink, the mean transfer delay increased from 0.024 s in the 5-train scenario to 0.043 s in the 75-train scenario. The uplink mean transfer delay was noticeably larger than the delay in downlink. Thus, while evaluating ETCS transfer delay, the uplink delay is more limiting, because it will reach the mean transfer delay limits faster than the downlink delay. The reasons for that are following:  ? In LTE, both uplink and downlink MAC resources are scheduled by eNodeB. Thus, in order to send data in the uplink, the UE needs to send a Scheduling Request (SR) or a Buffer Status Report (BSR) to the eNodeB. Then the eNodeB replies with a transmission grant, which needs to be processed by the UE. Only then, the UE may transmit in the uplink. This procedure contributes to the transfer delay [11].

? In L TE, uplink transmission has lower bitrate than downlink, because the UE has lower transmission power than eNodeB and the transmitter in the UE may not support the 64QAM modulation (depending on UE class).

In Figure 3 it is shown that the uplink utilization results reached 90% in the 35-train scenario. Then, looking at the uplink mean transfer delay in Figure 4, it can be seen that in the same 35-train scenario the uplink delay did not increase significantly.

Moreover, in the following scenarios with even more trains the uplink mean transfer delay was growing gradually. Therefore, it can be concluded that the utilization of the radio access shared channels did not have impact on the delay performance of the ETCS signaling. This is thanks to the QoS mechanism that was able to prioritize ETCS traffic despite the overload on the uplink radio access. It also shows that the QoS configuration was correct. It is an anticipated result, because the ETCS messages should not be affected by other types of traffic.

The relation between the number of trains (UEs) active in the modeled LIE cell and the mean transfer delay of EICS messages. Uplink (OBU to RBC) and downlink (RBC to OBU) cases are shown separately.

According to the ETCS requirements the mean transfer delay of ETCS messages cannot exceed 0.5 s. Therefore, despite of the delay increase, in all of the scenarios the ETCS mean transfer delay (both in downlink and uplink) was approximately an order of magnitude smaller than the 0.5 s limit. Therefore, LTE railway communication network fulfilled this ETCS requirement on the transfer delay.

Another ETCS requirement on the transfer delay states that 95% of ETCS messages have to be delivered within 1.5 s.

Figure 5 presents the relation between the number of trains in the L TE cell and the percentage of ETCS messages delivered within 1.5 s, i.e. the ratio of ETCS messages delivered within 1.5 s to the total number of ETCS messages transmitted. [t can be seen that in scenarios with less than 70 trains over 99.98% messages were delivered within the 1.5 s limit. This value remained fairly constant in all scenarios with less than 70 trains. Then, the percentage of ETCS messages delivered within 1.5 s started to decrease. It reached the lowest value of 99.85% in the 75-train scenario. Despite this drop in scenarios with more than 70 trains, all the recorded values are clearly above the minimum 95% required by the ETCS standard.

The reason for this drop in the percentage of messages delivered within 1.5 s is the fact that, in scenarios with more than 60 trains, most of the cell capacity becomes consumed by the GBR bearers.

Every train reserves a 128 Kbps GBR bearer for ETCS and a 96 Kbps GBR bearer for the interphone, both in downlink and uplink. Thus, when the number of trains exceeds 60, the transmitting bearers have to preempt the non-active bearers. This preemption mechanism introduces additional delay. This is why the Guaranteed Bandwidth for ETCS bearers should be reduced when a train station is expected to serve more than 60 trains. This should have non-significant negative influence on the ETCS transfer delay.

C. Discussion of the results  All in all, the results presented in Figures 4 and 5 show that the modeled L TE railway communication network can provide connectivity that fulfills the ETCS requirements on the message transfer delay.

were fulfilled in spite of the few worst-case assumptions made in the simulation scenarios, such as:  ? The limited 5 MHz frequency band.

? Number of trains (UEs) exceeding the realistic communication requirements at the modeled train station.

? Continuous application transmission.

? Large size of ETCS messages.

What is more, the ETCS requirements are fulfilled regardless of the utilization of the L TE physical channels. This can be observed in the 75-train scenario, where although the utilization of both PUSCH and POSCH reached 90%, the mean ETCS transfer delay increased only to 0.043 s (uplink) and 99.85% of ETCS messages were delivered within 1.5 s. This demonstrates that the QoS mechanism is working properly and ETCS messages are unaffected by the other applications transmitting concurrently.

Moreover, the results demonstrate that the modeled L TE cell provides enough capacity to simultaneously serve the 27 trains currently expected at Copenhagen Main Train Station.

Furthermore, the L TE cell will be able to simultaneously serve the 40 trains which are expected at the station in the year 2030.

This result is very important from the point of view of railway infrastructure managers, because it demonstrates that L TE network is capable of providing enough capacity to fulfill railway needs for many years ahead. Hence, investment in L TE should be considered relatively safe. On the contrary, the present GSM-R network may not have enough capacity to fulfill even the current railway needs.

It should also be noted that, the modeled L TE cell provided capacity for additional applications apart from ETCS signaling.

Thus, L TE opens a possibility for the introduction of new communication-based services for railways. In the case of   GSM-R this is impossible, because the capacity is not sufficient even for providing the most essential ETCS signaling.



VI. CONCLUSIONS  This paper presented LTE as an alternative to the obsolete GSM-R as communication infrastructure for railway operations.

The results, which were obtained from a series of OPNET network simulations, demonstrate that L TE can solve the problem of insufficient capacity of GSM-R network. LTE provides enough capacity to offer seamless ETCS connectivity at major stations, such as Copenhagen Main Station. LTE can even serve many more trains than the railway infrastructure can actually accommodate. As a consequence, an L TE communication network would not be a bottleneck restricting the number of trains, as GSM-R does.

What is more, L TE provides capacity for additional services alongside ETCS. Thanks to these, railways can introduce services enriching its offer for passengers and freight operators, e.g. by increasing passenger or goods safety.

Furthermore, the presented results show that L TE, despite being based on packet-switched transmission, fulfills the ETCS delay requirements effortlessly. Thanks to the built-in QoS mechanisms, these requirements are fulfilled even in the highest traffic-load conditions. This disproves the belief that only a circuit-switched based network can provide ETCS signaling, with sufficient guaranties for safety.
