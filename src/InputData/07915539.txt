Designing Combo Recharge Plans for Telecom  Subscribers using Itemset Mining Technique

Abstract?Customer retention in Telecom market is a big  research challenge in developed as well as developing economies as the market is almost saturated as well as competitive with large number of local and global service providers. It is also well known that from business point of view retaining an existing customer is much less costly than acquiring a new one. Hence retaining existing customer by making them loyal is crucial for the sake of existence of the telecom providers. Customers can be made loyal by making them satisfied customers. One of the important factors that make a customer satisfied is the value for money as well as proper prepaid recharge plans that will suit their requirements.

An association based rule mining model is proposed in this research work to enable telecom operators to choose proper recharge combo plans that will be mostly appropriate for the customers. The main objective of this analysis is to identify the frequent recharge-types (itemset) based on the support and confidence value from recharge history dataset. This will allow telecom providers to focus on creating combo plans by aggregating the mostly used service-categories.

I.  INTRODUCTION Telecom market has become much competitive with a good  number of service providers. Hence retaining loyal customers by making them satisfied customers is crucial for the sake of existence of the telecom provider. Customer attrition or Churn is defined as loss of customers. Churn rate is very high in saturated markets with large number of service provider. As on March 2015 India has average tele-density of 79.38% with urban tele-density of 148.61 % [1]. India has around 12-18 telecom operators with an almost saturated market. Monthly average churn rate in India is around 6%. Customers often switch service provider due to good promotional offers and lower monthly cost from other providers. As prepaid customers are not bind by any contract to the service providers so prepaid customers are inherently more prone to discontinue the service.

Indian customers are mostly prepaid customers, so there is always a very high chance of attrition. As per current data churn rate in India has gone up to 14 per cent per month with incremental net additions are at 8-10 million [1] [2]. Mobile number Portability (MNP) is a scheme that is introduced in India by Telecom Authority of India (TRAI). A customer can use MNP to change service provider without changing his/her mobile number. So looking at current MNP statistics in India  will give some insight about the grave necessity to reduce customer attrition. As per the latest press release of TRAI (Press Release No. 90/2016) around 5.16 million customers have used MNP in June 2016. Total number of MNP requests since inception stood around 224.43 million in the same period. We see that churn reduction has become a survival strategy for the telecom service providers.

Lot of research has been done on different ways to predict churn. Most of the existing work is based on postpaid customers where lot more information is available about the customer and comparatively easy to predict churn [7] [11] [17] [18]. Some work on prepaid churn has been done with the help of call detail record analysis [5].

In this work instead of predicting who are going to churn and offering them some promotional offer, This study will focus to minimize the customer dissatisfaction which is one of the most important attribute that contributes to churn. Goal of this study is to identify such recharge combo offers that will bundle all important services (like talk value, data, SMS, Value Added Services (VAS) etc.) in such a way to make most of the customers happy (with the offer) as well as maximize revenue per user from all services.

There are only selected type of benefits are there that any customer recharges for in case of prepaid and opts for in case of post- paid service connection (Fig 1).  Mainly customers spend their money for either one or more of the following services: talk time (in minutes or seconds), SMS balance (certain number of short messages per day or at nominal price per message etc.), internet data balance (in MB or GB or sometimes unlimited amount with a fixed validity period and FUP [fair usage policy] cap), or VAS services like customized ring tones, News update, share market recommendations, astrology, sports score update etc. Telecom providers have multiple recharge denominations with varying benefits and services for each category of the services mentioned above.

Customers recharge one or more of the following every month depending on their requirement.  This recharge history for each customer for each telecom circle is available in the operational data bases of the telecom service provider.

Our objective is to analyze those transactions to find suitable association rules to identify most frequently used recharge-types used by a customer. A single customer normally makes more than one recharge for different recharge-types  1Giridhar Maji,  2Sharmistha Mandal, 3Souvik Bhattacharya, 4Soumya Sen 1Department of Electrical Engineering, Asansol Polytechnic,Asansol, India  2Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Calcutta,Kolkata, India 3 Imperial College London, United Kingdom  4A.K.Choudhury School of Information Technology, University of Calcutta, Kolkata,India {1giridhar.maji@gmail.com, 2sharmistha.cse@gmail.com, 3souvik.bhattacharya16@imperial.ac.uk,  4iamsoumyasen@gmail.com}        mentioned above. Our aim is to identify those set of recharge types that are done very frequently and by a great percentage of customers within a fixed time period (may be for a month).

Fig. 1: Different types of recharges (?Recharge Types?).

Any association rule mining process consists of below two sub-processes:  1. Find all itemsets with adequate support value  2. Derive association rules from the above itemsets  Now the problem of finding frequently occurring recharge- types becomes similar to frequent itemset mining in large transactional data. A seminal algorithm to find frequent itemset using candidate generation is Apriori, first proposed in [21]. It is fast as in each step it uses only itemset generated in the previous steps instead of considering whole dataset in each iteration of the algorithm. Our proposed methodology will use Apriori to derive association rules. Association rule mining with support and confidence measures is discussed in next section.

A. Association Rule Mining with Support and Confidence The Data mining is the process of extracting golden nuggets  or hidden patterns from within large amount of transactional data. Knowledge discovered through this technique helps in strategic decision making. Data mining tasks can be of two types: Predictive and Descriptive. When a set of data attribute values are used to predict the value of a specific attribute, it comes under the category of predictive task. In descriptive task, on the other hand unknown and useful information like patterns, associations, anomalies and significant structures are extracted from large datasets [20].

Data mining supports many different techniques for knowledge discovery and prediction such as classification, clustering, sequential pattern mining, association rule mining and analysis. Data mining is extensively used in business analysis, strategic decision making, financial forecasting, future sales prediction etc. Our proposed model uses association rule mining technique. Agrawal [3] introduced association rules for showing patterns among items in large transaction dataset.

Consider the rule :{ bread} => {butter} It indicates if people are buying bread than they may also buy butter. Association rule mining is used here to show the relationship between different  items. It may identify correlation among items by analyzing a large transaction dataset. The association rule mining is also known as a market basket analysis. It is generally employed to understand customers buying pattern. Market basket analysis shows the different combination of items in the customer?s basket. It has applications in many other areas including big retail stores.

Two important concepts for association rules are:  a) Support is the fraction of the total transactions that matches the rule. It is defined for rule R as the ratio of the number of occurrence of R, given all occurrences of all rules [3].

Support (A -> B) = P (A U B) = Number of Transactions containing both A and B  Total Number of Transactions   b) Confidence signifies the strength of the rule. The confidence of a rule A ----> B, is the ratio of the number of occurrences of B given A, among all other occurrences given A. [3].

Confidence (A -> B) = P (B|A), the probability of B given A.

Confidence (A -> B) =  Number of Transactions containing both A and B  Number of Transactions containing A  We shall use association rule mining with support and confidence measures on prepaid recharge history dataset where all the recharges made in a month by a single customer will constitute a single transaction (one row) and our whole dataset will contain all customer data for a selected telecom circle of some month.



II. RELATED WORK Most of the telecom churns related researches focus on  either predicting potential churners and/or retaining potential churners before they actually churn. For churn prediction researchers has been used many different kinds of data to profile customers like customer demographics, billing history, contract/service status, service change log, call detail records (CDR) etc. All the above details are quite easily available to a telecom service provider for a post-paid customer, but for a pre- paid customer mainly CDR and recharge history data is available. So it is more difficult to predict a potential churner in pre-paid segment than post-paid. Authors in [7] uses post-paid customer profiling data with different data mining techniques such as neural network, decision trees  etc. to predict potential churners by assigning a propensity-to-churn score to each customer. Similar kind of comparative study on pre-paid data has been conducted by the author in [8] with linear logistic regression technique and decision tree on large data marts to model customer churn.

Most of the work on customer retention focuses on churner prediction and offering some kind of promotional offerings and/or targeted marketing towards those probable churner customers so that they stay with the service provider. Authors in [5] uses CDR and analyses call volume, call frequency,   Customer  Rate Cutter Promo  Recharge  SMS Recharge  Data Value Recharge  Talk Value Recharge  VAS Subscription  Recharge        calling time etc. to group customers and  to identify potential churners and proposes targeted promotional offerings to retain them. Authors in [9] developed a Usage Risk and Usage Opportunity (UR/UO) model to capture all customer usage related behavior and applied that model on prepaid customer data to categorize them into different groups such as grower, decliner, flat, stopper, new user etc. They use this knowledge for the telecom service provider to leverage the opportunities to enhance revenue and mitigate the usage risk. A different approach is based on social network analysis of the customer relationships with other customers. This model analyzes the features or attributes of the links or social ties among customers and uses the result obtained to predict churn. This model expects that all those customers connected by strong links will exhibit similar behavioral pattern, that is, if one of them churns then others will likely to follow [11]. In a recent study [12] researchers investigated the time-to-churn prediction possibilities using data mining techniques by social networking analysis. Social network analysis has been used to predict churn in [15] using relational learning algorithms to incorporate social network effects within a customer churn prediction setup.  A good and comprehensive review of different data mining techniques used for churn prediction has been discussed in [13] [14].

A lot of research studies have been done on retaining much volatile prepaid customers using call detail records, recharge history, calling pattern analysis etc. One important aspect of retaining customers is ?customer satisfaction?. If a customer is delighted and happy with the service and content with the promo offerings then he becomes a loyal customer and will not churn.  Authors in [6] designed MOBIE, a java and XML based multi agent tool to automatically recharge prepaid account of a user with personalization. It analyses previous recharge history of a prepaid customer and based on that recommends next recharge and if user is over used then it even alerts the user with the sole purpose of good customer experience and hence customer retention. In a very recent work [16] authors studies the relationship between the degrees of tariff choice misfit among mobile service subscribers with customer characteristics. It motivates us to model customer satisfaction  by offering them combo plans with all services with a little less overall tariff.

Our work mainly focuses on customer satisfaction by giving them value for money recharge offers in a way that fits them best. As in India and other developing economies most of the telecom customers are highly price sensitive and always look for value-for-money, so we try to model proper recharge combos that will give them more value at lower price and at the same time make sure to preserve average revenue per user (ARPU) with growing customer base.



III. PROPOSED METHODOLOGY We will briefly discuss the raw data available with the telecom service providers and transformations required on them to use with the Apriori for association rule mining.

A. Data Preprocessing Here we are showing only concerned parts of the operational data base schema of any ideal telecom service provider. We will show only the Transactions database that contains one row for each recharges made by customers and some associated tables that are referenced from transactions table.

In Recharge Plans table the field ?recharge_type? contains the values like data, talk time, SMS, VAS etc.

?Validity_Period? holds the validity of that recharge denomination in number of days. In Customer Details table ?home_circle? contains the name or identifier of the subscriber?s home circle (i.e. the telecom circle where user has registered her subscription). ?Service_Type? refers to the ?post- paid? or ?pre-paid? type of service the customer has opted for.

?Subscription_Start_Date? is the date from which the customer has started / registered for the services of the provider. In Transactions table ?recharge_status? contains values like successful, failed and pending. ?Current_Circle? contains the name or identifier of the telecom circle where the subscriber was during the time of recharge. With suitable select join and group by queries on the above schema we shall have data in the form as shown in table.

Home_Circle  Address  Name  Customer_Id  Customer Details  Subscription_Start_Date  Service_Type  ?  Recharge Plans  Recharge_Plan_Id  Recharge_Type  Validity_Period  Recharge_Amount  Data_Blnc_Credit  Main_Blnc_Credit  SMS_Blnc_Credit  ?  Transactions  Trans_Ref_Id  Recharge_Plan_Id  Recharge_Date  Customer_Id  Recharge_Status  Current_Circle  ?  Fig. 2: Operational Database schema (partial) of a generic Telecom Service Provider         Let there are a total of k number of unique recharge types offered by any telecom service provider.

So Let R = {R1, R2, R3?.Rk} is the set of all recharge types or recharge categories as we have defined.

Let the whole transaction set T = {T1,T2,?TN} where each transaction Ti  is represented as-  Ti  = (R1, R2,..Rk) ;  Ti may contain all type of recharge categories, a few of them or even none of them. In other words Ti is a subset of R. Ti is a Null set where the concerned customer (ith customer) has not made any recharge during that period. Ti contains all recharge categories i.e. Ti = R when customer has made all types of recharges during that period.

For the effectiveness of our analysis we eliminate all those transactions that are of following types:  ? Only a single recharge during the analysis period i.e.

Ti has only one element in it.

? All the recharges made by a customer are of same recharge category. i.e. again in the consolidated transaction set there will be only a single element in Ti .

B. Proposed Methodology We adapt the association rule mining using Apriori from  [22]. They used this for mining association rules in a retail dataset.

Input: Properly transformed and aggregated historical Recharge data of telecom subscribers (of some telecom circle), T.

Let s = minimum threshold support for an itemset to be considered. This value will be decided after consulting business experts and management of the telecom service provider.

In a similar way c = minimum threshold for confidence will be defined.

The Apriori Algorithm 1. Find all individual elements (1 element itemset, L1)  that have a minimum support of s.

2. DO  a. Use previously found i element itemset (Li) to find all (i+1) element itemsets with a minimum support.

b. This becomes the set of all frequent (i+1) itemsets that are interesting  3. WHILE itemset size less than k.

Deriving the Association rules with Apriori Step 1: Use Apriori to generate frequent item-sets of all different sizes  Step 2: During each iteration of Apriori divide each frequent itemset X into two parts antecedent (LHS) and consequent (RHS).  The Association rule becomes of the form R:  LHS->RHS.

Step 3: The confidence of such a rule is calculated as: Confidence (R) : =  support(X) / support(LHS)  Step 4: Discard all rules whose confidence is less than minimum confidence  Rank the Generated Association Rules Rank all the derived association rules as per there support  and confidence value. Top k rules are of importance. Value of K is defined by the business analyst of the concerned telecom operator.

Once frequent recharge types are identified with a good support count then next hurdle will be to identify what will be the denomination or value of the combo plan offered and what are the denominations of the component recharge types. To answer this question we need to first cluster the different recharge amounts of different recharge types into some meaningful groups. We will divide the common highest and lowest recharge amount of each recharge type into some range bound values.  We need to ignore the outlier recharge amounts though. For example if we find that most of the monthly data recharge values falls within ?X? to ?Y? then if there are very few recharge values below X and above Y then we will consider them as outlier for our model. Next we divide those recharge amount in some groups with lower and upper value range.

IV. AN ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE Let?s start with the sample transaction data of table 1 of  some telecom service provider for some telecom circle for the month of January 2016. We will work out all the steps of our proposed model step by step starting with required data preprocessing. We have shown only a small representative portion of a large recharge history data set due to space limitation. In the example shown we have only considered 3 recharge types viz. talk time, data and SMS for the sake of simplicity.

We have used SPMF open source data mining library [10] as a tool for the analysis (implemented in Java).

SAMPLE PRE-PROCESSED DATA SET  Cust_ID Talk Time TT  Group Data Data  Group SM S  SMS Group  CPR09101 220 TT_Grp_3 196 Data_Gr  p_2 0 NA  CPR09102 220 TT_Grp_3 0 NA 0 NA  CPR09103 20 TT_Grp_1 0 NA 49 SMS_Gr  p_4  CPR09104 230 TT_Grp_3 145 Data_Gr  p_2 14 SMS_Gr  p_1  CPR09105 55 TT_Grp_1 256 Data_Gr  p_3 28 SMS_Gr  p_2  CPR09106 950 Outlier 98 Data_Grp_1 144 Outlier  CPR09107 250 TT_Grp_3 147 Data_Gr  p_2 39 SMS_Gr  p_3  CPR09108 30 TT_Grp_1 280 Data_Gr  p_3 18 SMS_Gr  p_1  CPR09109 10 TT_Grp_1 75 Data_Gr  p_1 27 SMS_Gr  p_2  CPR091010 180 TT_Grp_2 196 Data_Gr  p_2 31 SMS_Gr  p_3  CPR091011 155 TT_Grp_2 145 Data_Gr  p_2 42 SMS_Gr  p_4   Step 1: Aggregate all similar recharge types into a single entry in the working dataset. A recharge amount of zero value (Rs 0) indicates that no recharge of that type has been made during that period by the customer. Aggregated recharge amounts per customer has been depicted in table 2.

Step 2: Cluster the recharge amount values into groups and assign them a group number. In real situation recharge amount groupings should be done in consultation with the business management and also looking at the historical recharge data.

For our clustering (grouping) following steps were followed:  a. Scatter plotting the historical monthly recharge amounts will give us the minimum and maximum recharge range values with outliers identified and ignored.

b. Minimum recharge amount is taken as the minimum possible recharge amount for that recharge type. For example in our case minimum top up recharge is Rs 10 and minimum data value recharge is Rs 8 etc. In real data these business information will be available from concerned telecom service provider.

We now have total 15(3 recharge types with 5 groups each) different items in the itemset. with threshold support value = 0.1.

Step 5: We combine top k most frequent itemsets together and offer different recharge combo offers.

In sample run we see that talk time recharge of value between Rs400-500 and data recharge of value Rs100-200 is very frequent. So both of these can be combined and denomination can be made between Rs500-700.



V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK We have proposed a model and  analyzed a set of recharge  transaction data and used Apriori algorithm to find the support and confidence values for different recharge-types of recharge plans and ranked them in order of their support count i.e.

percentage of customers using those service-category recharges in the same month. We have also discussed data pre-processing steps to generate the item set from raw recharge transactions dataset. Proposed model allows us to generate combo data plans after analysis. Expectation is that these combo plans with cost price slightly less than the individual price combined will make most of the customers happy as well as telecom service provider can be sure to get full potential revenue from those customers.

Future work will include analysis on the monthly amount spend by any single customer for different type of recharges and based of them new combo plans of different recharge denominations will be calculated. A customer may recharge same type of recharge multiple times in a month so aggregating them for the whole month needs to be done. Some of the existing recharge plans may have varying validity period so proper modeling needs to be done to accommodate it before considering them for monthly analysis.
