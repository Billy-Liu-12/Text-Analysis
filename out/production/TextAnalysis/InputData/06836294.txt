Abstract? Visited only by Voyager 2 in 1989, Neptune and its  moon Triton hold important clues to the formation and  evolution of the solar system and exoplanetary systems.

Neptune-sized planets are the most commonly discovered  exoplanets to date. Neptune, an ice giant, is theorized to have  migrated from its formation location in the early solar system.

This migration affects the expected interior structure,  composition, and dynamical evolution of the planet. Triton is  conjectured to be a heavily-processed, captured Kuiper Belt  Object (KBO), a remnant from the early solar nebula and  unique in our solar system. Triton may possess a subsurface  aqueous ocean, making it an important astrobiological target.

The 2013-2022 Planetary Science Decadal Survey [1] identified  a number of high priority science goals for the Neptunian  system, including understanding the structure, composition,  and dynamics of Neptune?s atmosphere and magnetosphere, as  well as surveying the surface of Triton. Following these  guidelines, we present a low cost flyby mission concept to  Neptune and Triton: TRIDENT (Taking Remote and In-situ  Data to Explore Neptune and Triton). TRIDENT would carry  six instruments and a government furnished atmospheric  probe and would provide significant improvements over the  scientific measurements undertaken by Voyager 2.

In this paper, we first provide a detailed overview of the  science questions pertaining to Neptune and Triton and of the  science investigations necessary to elucidate them. We then  present the design of TRIDENT?s instrument suite, the  trajectory and the spacecraft, as well as the motivation behind  each of our choices. In particular, we demonstrate that, for a  mission launched on an Atlas V 551, a Neptune orbiter mission  would be infeasible with current technology levels without the  use of aerocapture. We therefore present a flyby mission  concept with a cost lower than FY2015 $1.5B. We also show  that the proposed mission has low risk and significant margin  and that several de-scope options are available in the event of  cost overruns.

This study was prepared in conjunction with the NASA 2013  Planetary Science Summer School. The work presented is a  hypothetical mission proposal, for planning and discussion  purposes only. It does not represent NASA?s interests in any  way.
