Abstract? The Portable Radio Science Receiver (PRSR) is a suitcase-sized open-loop digital receiver designed to be small and easy to transport so that it can be deployed quickly and easily anywhere in the world.  The PRSR digitizes, down- converts, and filters using custom hardware, firmware, and software.  Up to 16 channels can be independently configured and recorded with a total data rate of up to 256 Mbps.  The design and implementation of the system's hardware, firmware, and software is described.  To minimize costs and time to deployment, our design leveraged elements of the hardware, firmware, and software designs from the existing full-sized operational (non-portable) Radio Science Receivers (RSR) and Wideband VLBI Science Receivers (WVSR), which have successfully supported flagship NASA deep space missions at all Deep Space Network (DSN) sites.

We discuss a demonstration of the PRSR using VLBI, with one part per billion angular resolution: 1 nano-radian / 200 ?as.

This is the highest resolution astronomical instrument ever operated solely from the Southern Hemisphere.   Preliminary results from two sites are presented, including the European Space Agency (ESA) sites at Cebreros, Spain and Malarg?e, Argentina.  Malarg?e?s South American location is of special interest because it greatly improves the geometric coverage for spacecraft navigation in the Southern Hemisphere and will for the first time provide coverage to the 1/4 of the range of declination that has been excluded from reference frame work at Ka-band.
