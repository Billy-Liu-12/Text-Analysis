Discovery of Associated Topics for the Intelligent Browsing ?

Abstract Intelligent browsing of topics is one of the key issues of the Web and the Knowledge Grid, which provides on-demand services to support knowledge discovery and innovation. In this paper, Background of topics composed by Associated Relations (BAR) between keywords belonging to one domain is developed to extend the topics? associated relations based on the Element Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (E-FCMs), which helps us discover the associated topics that do not have direct associated relation at the keyword level. The Matrix of element Concepts (MC) is presented to store element concepts of topics. Through MC we can obtain the causal concepts of each topic in one domain; logic operation ?AND? is given to get associated topics.

Semantic Link Network (SLN) is automatically generated by the associated topics, which can realize the intelligent browsing of topics in Web or Knowledge Grid. Experimental results show that the browsing path of topics is easier to be built by the proposed algorithm and the associated topic can be recommended automatically. Meanwhile, an application of the associated topics in multimedia provides a good prospect on the cross media intelligent browsing.

INTRODUCTION Current URL based Web browsing lacks semantics  and is easy to make users get lost in Web, so many researches focus on the process of intelligent browsing [1-3]. For example, Markov chain based browsing is proposed by [4], which extracts user's browsing process as a special stochastic process and user's browsing characteristics are described by the transition probability matrix. Based on this model, multi-  dimensions transition matrix is introduced for improving the accuracy of browsing [5]. The ?Adaptive Web Sites? approach is proposed by [6], which can automatically change their presentation and organization to aid users? browsing by learning the data of Web usage. There are some other proposed models of intelligent browsing such as [7, 8] which develop models to address how users choose new sites and to extract the distribution of the number of pages visited by users at Web sites.

Although some achievements of intelligent browsing have been gained, existing browsing algorithms can not support topic browsing with rich semantics because they can not resolve the following basic issues. 1) How to represent the textual and multimedia information contained in Web with rich semantics. 2) How to build a Semantic Link Network (SLN) [9] to guide user?s topics browsing, which enables people to effectively capture, share and manage knowledge resources (e.g. multimedia topics), and provides on-demand services to support knowledge discovery and innovation.

There are also many methods on the discovery of association rules which include Apriori [10], sequential pattern mining [11], episodes mining [12] etc.

However, the majority of above methods only discover the association rules at the keyword level which has a low semantics. In this paper, we propose a discovery algorithm of associated relation at the topic level which has a high semantics instead of keyword level with the help of E-FCMs.

The organization of this paper is as follows. Some related terms are introduced in section 2. The discovery algorithm of associated topics is developed in section 3.

Section 4 gives the analysis of the complexity of the proposed algorithm. Experimental results are discussed in section 5. Section 6 presents an application of the associated topics in intelligent browsing. In the last section, some conclusions are given.

_____________________________________    2. RELATED TERMS We know that Element Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (E-  FCMs) have a good capability to represent Web resources with rich semantics and can be understood by machine easily [18-19]. Semantic Link Network (SLN) [9] can link not only textual topics but also multimedia topics (e.g. relation of topics between text and video). Therefore, in this paper, E-FCM is proposed to represent Web resources and SLN is introduced to link these Web resources based on the discovery of associated topics, which can guide users? intelligent browsing of topics.

Term 1 Element Fuzzy Cognitive Map, E-FCM Element Fuzzy Cognitive Map (E-FCM) is a fuzzy  cognitive map [20-21], whose element concepts are represented by keywords; state values of element concepts are calculated by the function of its frequency, position and font size in paragraphs or a section; theme concept is represented by the implied semantics of co- occurrence keywords appearing in a topic; the relations between concepts and their weights are represented by the relations between keywords and topic as well as their weights.

The knowledge of topic is represented by E-FCMs, which reflects the keywords? relations and their weights as well as the state values of co-occurrence keywords appearing in a topic. Semantic information of co-occurrence keywords expressed by E-FCM is richer than a set of separate keywords for E-FCM storing topic information instead of the separate keywords of topic. For example, Figure 1 is a topic (denoted as topic 1) about the ?Smoking on the life of people? represented by E-FCM.

Life  Nicotinism  Smoking  Smoking on the life of people  0.23  0.3 0.25  0.35  0.55  Breath  0.45 0.1  C2  C1  C3  C4  Figure 1. ?Smoking on the life of people? represented by E-FCM (denoted as topic1)  In this paper, E-FCM and its element concepts have the same meaning as the topic and its keywords because the topic and its keywords are represented by E-FCM and element concept respectively. If there is an association rule in an E-FCM such as ?if A then B (denoted as A->B)?, then we call A is a causal concept and B is an effect concept in the following discussion because the association rule is a weak causal relation.

Term 2 Semantic Link Network, SLN A semantic link network consists of semantic nodes  and semantic links (relations) between nodes. A semantic node can be a semantic community, a schema, a concept, a feature, an entity or an identity [9].

The semantic link network (SLN) is designed to establish semantic relationships among various resources (data, image and various documents) aiming at extending the hyperlink network World Wide Web to a semantic-rich network [9].

Herein, the semantic nodes are the topics (e.g.

multimedia topics or textual topics) and the semantic relations are the associated relations in a semantic link network. SLN-based intelligent browsing can guide users to browse the cross media information that makes the Web or Knowledge Grid browsing more vivid, diversiform, and visual.

3. DISCOVERY OF ASSOCIATED RELATION BETWEEN TOPICS  In this paper, we define a term to measure the Weight of Associated Relation (WAR) between topics which are represented by E-FCMs. The definition of this term comprises two aspects: 1) The existence of the associated relation between topics; 2) the measurement of its value. To describe these two aspects, the following factors need to be discussed. 1) Associated Relation between topics (AR); 2) Matrix of element Concepts (MC); 3) Background of topics composed by Associated Relations (BAR); 4) Weight of Associated Relation (WAR) between topics in a domain.

3.1 Associated Relation between topics (AR) Associated relation exists not only between concepts/keywords but also topics/E-FCMs, which means one topic/ E-FCM may be an ancestor of another topic /E-FCM. For example if you browse a topic about ?obese people face bigger cancer risk?, then you may want to browse some topics about ?weight loss?. Therefore, the topic ?obese people face bigger cancer risk? is an ancestor of the topic ?weight loss?. There is an associated relation between the two topics.

3.2 Matrix of element Concepts (MC)  Matrix of element Concepts ( ( )ijMC mc= ) expresses the existence of element concepts in an E-FCM. If E- FCMi contains concept j, then the value of the ith row and jth column element of MC is 1. Each element in MC is computed by  =  ? =  0,0  0,1  j  j ij w  w mc  where wj is the weight from concept Cj to the theme concept of E-FCMi.

Notice that element mcij has different meaning from wj, because one element concept may be a causal concept in one E-FCM/topic but an effect concept in other E-FCMs/topics in a domain. In MC, each row vector which is denoted by CC (i) indicates the existence of the element concepts which may be a causal or effect concept of other E-FCM included in E- FCMi.

For example, CC (1) = [1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0] denotes that C1, C2, C3 and C4 exist in E- FCM1/topic1, which implies that these element concepts may be causal concepts or effect concepts in other E-FCMs/topics. Associated relation between E- FCMs is determined by the pair of causal-effect element concepts. The matrix of element concepts in E- FCM1 /topic1 to E-FCM7/ topic 7 is shown in Table 1.

Table 1. Matrix of element concepts in E-FCM1 to E-FCM7 C1 C2 C3 C4 C5 C6 C7 C8 C9 C1   C1  C12 C1  C1  C1  C1  C17  CC(1) 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 CC(2) 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 CC(3) 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 CC(4) 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 CC(5) 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 CC(6) 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 CC(7) 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0  In Table 1, C1 to C17 is the total element concepts in topic1 to topic 7 {smoking, life, Nicotinism, breath, cancer cell, pathological changes, proliferate, health, diet, sport, lung cancer, cardiovascular, coronary heart disease, heart disease, blood pressure, quit smoking, carcinogenic substances}.

3.3 Background of topics composed by ociation Rules (BAR)Ass  Background of topics composed by Association Rules is a matrix ( ) which expresses the keyword-level value of associated relation. In order to extend the associated relation between element concepts/keywords, we need to check all the E-FCMs for discovering the associated relations at the keyword level. Herein, this matrix is used to store all the  associated relations at the keyword level in one domain.

The element (i, j) in BAR is computed by  ( )ijBAR bar=   n k  i j i j k  b a r w n =  =  where wij is the weight of associated relation from Ci to Cj in E-FCMk; n is the number of E-FCMs which include wij.

In BAR, the ith row vector indicates all the values of associated relations at the keyword level in the domain when the causal concept is Ci, and the jth column vector indicates all the values of associated relations at the keyword level when the effect concept is Cj. For example, the background of topic1 to topic7 is shown in Table 2.

In BAR, if (Ci, Cj) 0, then there is an associated relation from Ci to Cj. Therefore, given a causal concept, we can find all the possible effect concepts with the help of BAR.

Table 2. The background of topic1 to topic7 C1 C2 C3 C4 C5 C6 C7 C8 C9 C10 C11 C12 C13 C14 C15 C16 C17  C1 0 0 0 0 0.55 0 0 0 0 0 0.42 0 0 0 0 0 0 C2 0.23 0 0.55 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 C3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  ?? C16 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 C17 0 0.6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  In addition, if sum all the values of the ith row in BAR, we can obtain the capability of Ci as the causal concept in other topics. For example, the sum of the 1st row in Table 2 is 0.97 which can measure the capability of C1 as the causal concept in other topics within a domain.

3.4 Association weight of topic in a domain The association weight of topici in a domain reflects the capability of a topic when it contributes to the causal side. Association weight of topici is denoted as Aw (i), which can be computed by  { }  ( ) , ( , ) 0 n  jk j k  A w i b a r j x M C i x =  = ? ?    where n denotes the number of all element which is not zero in row j; barjk denotes the element (j, k) in BAR.

In this formula,  n  jk j k  bar =  denotes the capability of  each concept in topici when it plays a role of the causal side of the relation. We can obtain the maximal value of association weight included in topici by Aw (i), which means that Aw (i) provides a reference to measure the weight of associated relation from topici to topicj.

The main steps to calculate Aw (i) are as follows.

1) Obtain all the element concepts that exist in topici  which is the ith row of MC, CC (i), and store the columns of CC (i) which is not zero in a set.

2) According to each element in the set of CC (i), find the correspondence row in BAR.

3) Sum all the values in each row.

4) Sum all values got in step 3).

For example, topic1 in MC is represented by CC (1) = [1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]. Then add each element which is not zero in Table 3, so we can obtain Aw (1) =2.2, which is the maximal value of all associated relation from E-FCM1 to other E-FCMs.

3.5 Association weight from topici to topicj Association weight from topici to topicj is denoted by Aw (i, j), which is the sum of the causal concepts in topici and effect concepts in topicj. It reflects the associated relation on the topic level. Aw (i, j) is computed by  { } {( , ) , ( , ) 0 , ( , ) 0pq p q  Aw i j bar p x MC i x q y MC j y= ? ? ? }? where p and q is the column coordinate of MC (i, p) and MC (j, q) which is the non-zero element and barpq denotes the element (p, q) in BAR.

The main steps to calculate Aw (i, j) are as follows.

1) Obtain the element concepts in topici from MC.

2) In the BAR of topici, sum all the values of each  column and store the result into a vector.

3) Execute ?AND? operation on the vector got in step  3 and the jth row of MC, then stores the corresponding result in a vector.

4) Sum each element in the vector got in step 3), thus to get Aw (i, j).

For example, if we want to get the association relation from topic1 to topic2, then firstly we obtain CC  (1) = [1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0] from MC and get the set of index of concept in topic1 {1, 2, 3, 4}.

Secondly, we sum all the values of each column of BAR of topic1, and get the vector [0.23, 0,1, 0, 0.55,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.42,0,0,0,0,0,0], shown in Table 3.

Thirdly, we execute ?AND? operation on vector [0.23,0,1,0,0.55,0,0,0,0,0,0.0.42,0,0,0,0,0,0] and the 2nd row of MC, getting vector [0.23,0, 0, 0, 0.55,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2. The ?AND? operation Finally, we sum the entire element in the vector and  get Aw (1, 2) = 0.23+0.55 = 0.78.

Through Aw (i, j), we can obtain association weight  from topici to topicj, which means that we can automatically generate a SLN based on Aw (i, j). After we obtain Aw (i) and Aw (i, j), it is easy to obtain WAR (i, j), which reflects the normalization weight of associated relation from topici to topicj. WAR (i, j) is calculated by  ( , )( , ) ( ) A w i jW A R i j A w i=  WAR (i, j) is a normalization value which reflects the importance of associated relation between E-FCMj and E-FCMi. So all of the WAR (i, j) is in the interval [0, 1].

4 EXPERIMENT AND DISCUSSION 4.1Experimental data 170 web pages are downloaded from http://www.yahoo.com firstly. All of them are about the domain of ?environment?. Then, 170 E-FCMs are generated according to the algorithm in [18]. Thirdly, the associated topics between the 170 web pages are discovered. Finally, SLNs are automatically generated based on the discovery of associated topics. The experimental results are shown in Figure 3, which is a SLN of the 170 web pages from the website of Yahoo.

We can also consider it as a semantic map of the 170 web pages. Each web page has a semantic link to other web pages. In fact, each web page may have more than one semantic link to other web pages, but we only select the semantic link with maximal weight, which can help us analyze SLN easily and effectively because some semantic links? weight is too low to reflect the semantics between two web pages.

The associated topics between the 170 web pages and the SLNs automatically generated by them  4.2 Comparison of our experimental results with Web page link in www.yahoo.com  In the website of yahoo, we find these web pages do not have any links to other pages in the domain of ?environment?, which means the users can not browse web pages in same domain through the hyperlink. Users can only browse them by URL without considering any semantics between them, which makes the browsing lost in the 170 web pages. Our SLN provides a method to solve this problem. SLN between these 170 web pages is built as shown in Figure 3, which can help users? topics browsing easily. Our result is not just a link which guide user to browse other web page. It has semantics and can be generated automatically, instead.

4.3 Experimental results prove our algorithm is  feasible Two web pages are extracted from Figure 3, which  have maximal weight shown in Figure 4. The Aw (i, j) of two web pages is 28.5. The weight is high and the number of association rules is also huge, so we believe that the two web pages have strong associated relation.

Figure 4. The strong associated topics between the topics ?Bush says nuclear energy 'best' for greenhouse gases? and ?US government rejects California bid for tough emissions standards?  The other two web pages are also extracted from Figure 3, which have minimum weight shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5. The weak associated topics between the topics ?Locals want more from IBM for pollution? and  ?Greenpeace finds Japan's whalers? From the comparison of Figure 4 and Figure 5, we can  say our algorithm can reflect the associated relation between web pages which is represented by E-FCM. The weight between web pages can also reflect the importance weight of the associated topics. In fact in SLN we can use threshold to eliminate these semantic links which have low semantics/weights.

5. Multimedia browsing based on the  erated SLNgen According to the discussions of the experiments, we find a unidirectional semantic link (SL) from the generated SLNs, which provides a way to help users? topics browsing and reducing users? lost in the Web or Knowledge Grid.

E-FCM can not only be used in text but also in multimedia such as image, video, sound and so on. For example, Figure 6 has twenty two topics represented by E-FCMs. All of them are about ?US 2008 Presidential Election? Some of the twenty two topics are web pages or images from www.yahoo.com, the others are videos from www.youtube.com. SLN of them is generated according to the proposed algorithm. Figure 6 is a SLN based on the associated relations of all web pages.

Figure 6. Twenty two E-FCMs about ?US 2008 Presidential Election?    According to Figure 6, we can generate a browsing path on cross multimedia, which means that we can not only browse what we are interested but also can see or listen to what we are interested. Figure 7 is a simple browsing flow containing four Web resources which are extracted from Figure 6.  In Figure 7 we can see these four Web resources have strong Aw (i, j) of them so we can use this simple semantic link to be a browsing flow.

(a). The topic of ?Daughter, wife attend same service? (Michelle Obama, wife of Barack Obama) (from the  website Yahoo)  (b).The topic of ?Obama urges unity; Clinton visits Harlem? (from the website Yahoo)  (c). The topic of ?Clinton heads to Harlem after Nevada win? (from the website Youtube)  (d). The topic of ?McCain wins most delegates? (from the website Yahoo)  Figure 7. A simple browsing flow of Figure 6  6. CONCLUSIONS  Discovery of associated relation between topics can help users browse information with rich semantics, which reduces users? lost in the Web browsing or Knowledge Grid. This paper focuses on this issue. Our contributions mainly include the following aspects.

1) The background of topics composed by the association rules at the keyword level is used to extend the associated relations at the topic level;  2) Element concept matrix is used to store element concepts/keywords of each E-FCM/topic;  3) ?AND? operation is introduced to obtain the weight of causal-effect from topici to topicj;  4) Semantic Link Network is generated to guide user?s intelligent browsing.
