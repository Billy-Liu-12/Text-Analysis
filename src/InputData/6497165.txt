Abstract??The Titan Mare Explorer (TiME) is a Discovery- class mission concept that underwent a detailed Phase A study in 2011-2012. The mission would splashdown a capsule on Titan?s ethane sea Ligeia Mare as early as the summer of 2023, and would spend multiple Titan days performing science measurements and transmitting data directly back to Earth.

This paper reviews briefly the mission concept.
