Lecturer-led Online-assisted Learning Among Tertiary Students

Abstract There is vast disparity in the usages of online functions  learning motivation, facilitation by lecturers, and a general habit or culture of keeping up with online applications. One recent online resource is blog, which witnessed varied usages in everyday life communication, and is equally relevant for exchanges and discussion for most course delivery, including tertiary courses. The purpose of this study is to look at how usages of online learning by students in Chienkuo Technology University (CTU), by high and  of online features in their courses. Results from 268 cases usages of blog for online submission of  blog for checking course announcement, discussion, syllabus, notes, and group discussion. For the high attitude group, three more blog usages were observed for finding teaching material, course discussion, and checking course notes. The implications of the study were discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION It has generally been substantiated that there are multiple  benefits of using online-assisted learning for students, staff training, and other situations where acquiring new knowledge and skills are desirable[1]. Online-assisted learning among tertiary institutions started about a decade ago. While the adoption process is generally quick and wide spread among developed societies such as the United States and the United Kingdom, its adoption in less developed societies has been less satisfactory [2]. There is further vast disparity in the usages of online functions among tertiary institutions in less developed societies, depending on  lecturers, and a general habit or culture of keeping up with online applications [3]. One recent online resource is blog, which witnessed varied usages in everyday life communication, and is equally relevant for exchanges and discussion for most course delivery, including tertiary courses.

For tertiary institutions, it is a plausible assumption that  hinges on whether the lecturer usages online resources and in what ways. Lecturers who are more proactive in adopting online features in their courses, such as online submission of assignments and conducting tests online may help to foster a tendency for students to make better use of other online  usages of online-assisted learning is invariably related to their underlining attitude toward using online resources.

Students with positive attitudes toward using online resources are more likely to take action to use the resources than those who do not have as positive attitudes.

The purpose of this study is to look at how usages of  online learning by students in Chienkuo Technology University (CTU), by high and low online attitude groups,  their courses. The specific online resources included in this usages of blog. For CTU,  online teaching provisions or resources are generally available, such as online test, roll call, course announcement, group discussion, and the like. Individual lecturers make their own decisions if and to what extent that they include online features in the delivery of their courses.



II. METHDOLOGY To find out if certain usages of blog by course lecturers  usages of blog, mining association rules are useful to uncover strengths of relationship between blog usages by lecturers and students.

Baysian network analysis was used to analyze the connectedness between those usages [4]. The mining association rules have two steps, finding out frequent item sets that blog use A and use B happen jointly, i.e., the support, or probability (A B ), then finding out the confidence, or probability (B/A ) [5]that blog use B is chosen given the student has chosen blog use A already.

Researchers often have to determine arbitrarily the criteria whether there is support or confidence. In this study, significant support is defined as probability (A B) is higher  2012 International Symposium on Computer, Consumer and Control  DOI 10.1109/IS3C.2012.245   2012 International Symposium on Computer, Consumer and Control  DOI 10.1109/IS3C.2012.245   2012 International Symposium on Computer, Consumer and Control  DOI 10.1109/IS3C.2012.245     than 0.16, and significant confidence defined as probability (B/A ) higher than 0.35.

The questionnaire included one attitude scale and 11  questions regarding student usages of course blog as assisted learning. Fifty-five (55) students pilot tested the  reliability of the attitude scale and the reliability coefficient was 0.87, which was deemed to be acceptable. Four hundred and forty-three (443) students were asked to fill in the questionnaire, resulting in a response rate of 100%.

Ten statements were included in the attitude scale with  four response options: 1=Strongly Disagree, 2=Disagree, an score  for the 10 questions of the scale was performed. The mean mode for all the 443 students was 2.91. One hundred and thirteen (113) students with mean scores above 2.91 were classified in the high attitude group, whereas those 155 with mean scores below 2.91 were classified in the low attitude group.



III. RESULTS The results are discussed in light of two groups, low and  high attitude groups toward usages of blog as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2 respectively. For the low attitude group, stronger associations existed between lecturers who used blog for assignment submission and students who checked course announcements (0.29 for support and 0.60 for confidence), and who obtained teaching material (0.41 for support and 0.85 for confidence) over blog. Another four stronger links were shown between lecturers who used blog for online tests and students who used blog for course discussion (0.17 for support and 0.55 for confidence), course syllabus (0.16 for support and 0.52 for confidence),  course notes (0.19 for support and 0.61 for confidence), and group discussion (0.17 for support and 0.63 for confidence).

For the high attitude group, the same stronger associations  usages of blog. It is worth noting that three further stronger linkages also showed up. Two linkages are observed between  and 0.46 for confidence) and for checking course notes (0.31 for support and 0.79 for confidence). The other  material (0.18 for support and 0.46 for confidence).



IV. MPLICATIONS One implication of this research can be encouraging  lecturers to use blog as much as they can to bring students on board for using blog in their course work. Another implication can be helping students to foster a positive attitude toward using blogs.
