CONTEXT-BASED KNOWLEDGE SUPPORT FOR PROBLEM-SOLVING BY  RULE-INFERENCE AND CASE-BASED REASONING

Abstract: Problem-solving is an important process that enables  corporations to create competitive business advantages.

Traditionally, case-based reasoning techniques have been widely used to help workers solve problems. However, conventional approaches focus on identifying similar problems without exploring relevant context of problem situations.

Situation features are generally occurred according to the context characteristics of problem. Moreover, situation features collected are usually partial or incomplete. Workers need to use knowledge inferred from relevant context information and previous problem-solving experience to clarify the causes and take appropriate action effectively. In this paper, we propose to use rule inference to infer possible situation features based on context information. Association rule mining is used to discover context-based inference rules from historical problem-solving logs. The discovered patterns identify frequent associations between context information and situation features, and therefore can be used to infer more situation features. By considering the inferred situation features, case-based reasoning can then be employed to identify similar situations effectively. Moreover, we employ information retrieval techniques to extract context-based situation profiles to model workers' information needs when handling problem situations in certain context. Effective knowledge support can thus be facilitated by providing workers with situation-relevant information based on the profiles.

Introduction  Problem-solving is an important process that enables corporations to create competitive advantages, especially in the manufacturing industry. Case-based reasoning (CBR) techniques [5][9][13][19] have been widely used to help  workers solve problems. For example, based on these techniques, a decision support system was developed to facilitate problem-solving in a complex production process [13]. CBR techniques have also been used to implement a self-improvement helpdesk service system [5], and integrated with the ART-Kohonen Neural Network (ART-KNN) to enhance fault diagnosis in electric motors [19].

Conventional CBR approaches focus on identifying similar problems without exploring relevant context of problem situations during the problem-solving process.

Problem-solving is a complex process that includes a series of uncertain situations and operational actions [8][11].

Situation features are usually occurred according to the context characteristics of problem. In such uncertain environments, situation features collected by system are usually partial or incomplete. Workers need to use knowledge inferred from relevant context information and previous problem-solving experience to clarify the causes and take appropriate action effectively. Thus, identifying similar situations through CBR is not sufficient to solve problems. A knowledge support framework is essential so that workers have information necessary to take appropriate action to solve problem.

In this work, we propose a context-based knowledge support system for problem-solving. Besides adopting CBR to identify similar situations, we employ rule inference [17] and information retrieval techniques [4][14][15][16][18] to compensate for the shortcomings of CBR. For specific situations, their situation features, context information and relevant information (documents) accessed by workers are recorded in a problem-solving log. Historical codified knowledge (textual documents), i.e., experience and know-how extracted from previous problem-solving logs, can provide valuable knowledge for solving the current problem.

The proposed system employs association rule mining methods [2][3][7] to discover context-based inference rules from the problem-solving log. Context-based inference rules identify frequent associations between situation features and relevant context characteristics. The system can then use context-based inference rules to infer more situation features to assist CBR in situation identification.

For example, the situation feature collected by water supply system in a production line is ?system failure?. The context-based inference rule indicates that the situation feature ?Water supply pipe broken? is frequently associated with the situation feature ?system failure? and the context of ?power supply unstable?. The inferred situation feature can provide CBR with more clues in situation identification.

Moreover, the proposed system employs Information Retrieval (IR) techniques to extract the key concepts of relevant information necessary to handle a specific situation [1][6]. The extracted key concepts form a context-based situation profile that models the information needs of workers for handling problem situations in certain context [10][12]. The system can then use the context-based situation profile to gather existing and new relevant knowledge documents for specific situation according to the context information.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

Section 2 introduces the proposed framework of knowledge support for problem-solving. Section 3 describes the discovery of context-based knowledge. The context-based knowledge and its usage are discussed in Section 4. Finally, in Section 5, we present our conclusions.

2. The system framework of knowledge support for problem-solving  In this section, we describe the proposed system framework, including the concepts of the problem-solving process, the knowledge required for problem-solving, and the proposed knowledge support framework. A wafer manufacturing process in a semiconductor foundry is used to illustrate the proposed approach. The process comprises the following steps: crystal growing, wafer cutting, edge rounding, lapping, etching, polishing, cleaning, final inspection, packaging and shipping. The wafer cleaning step mainly uses DI (de-ionized; ultra-pure) water to remove debris left over from the mounting wax and/or polishing agent. A stable water supply system to deliver ultra-pure water for wafer cleaning is therefore vital in semiconductor manufacturing.

2.1. The problem-solving process  In business enterprises, especially the manufacturing industry, various problem situations may occur during the production process; for example, poor production performance, system overload, and low machine utilization.

A situation denotes an evaluation point to determine the status (i.e., desirable or undesirable) of a production process.

A problem may occur if there is a discrepancy between the actual situation and the desired one. For example, when the current production output is below the desired level, the production line may have some problems. Thus, a problem-solving process is often initiated to achieve the desired situation. In the process, workers take several problem-solving steps to determine what action needs to be taken to resolve the situation. Such action involves both human wisdom and enterprise knowledge. Workers may observe a problem situation, collect relevant information from the enterprise knowledge repository, explore possible causes, and identify operational conditions in order to decide appropriate action.

2.2. Knowledge requirements for problem-solving  Context-based inference. For a given problem, a situation may occur with various features according to the context at that time. Because situation features collected by system are usually partial or incomplete, a worker can not easily identify current situation. Accordingly, inferring more situation features according to the context characteristics is important in situation identification. For example, the water supply system in a production line provides pure water for wafer cleaning. When the system gets the situation feature ?Production-quality low?, the causes may be so many that a worker can not easily identify the situation. Situation feature ?Water supply quantity insufficient? is inferred from the situation feature ?Production quality low? and context characteristic ?Pressure of water unstable?. The context characteristic ?Pressure of water unstable? and inferred situation features ?Water supply quantity insufficient? provide CBR with more clues to identify current situation as ?Water supply abnormal issue?.

Context-based situation profile. For specific situation, information retrieval techniques are used to extract key terms from situation relevant documents. The extracted key terms form a profile to represent the information needs of workers for handling the situation. Moreover, the profile can be generated according to the context of the situation and is regarded as a context-based situation profile.

According to certain context, the key terms recorded in a context-based situation profile are used to locate the      relevant documents. The relevant documents are recommended as knowledge support to help workers take appropriate action for handling the situation in certain context.

2.3. Knowledge support framework for problem-solving  The proposed knowledge support framework for problem-solving is shown in Figure 1. The system framework comprises a problem-solving process, context-based inference rule discovery, context-based situation profile discovery, and knowledge recommendation modules.

Knowledge support framework for problem-solving  Problem-solving module. This module gathers production line run-time information, such as problem situation features. Collected and inferred situation features help CBR to retrieve similar situation cases. Workers can then execute a specific problem-solving process and obtain relevant knowledge documents from the knowledge recommendation module. The problem-solving steps, including the situations, actions, and corresponding knowledge documents, are recorded in the historical log.

Context-based Inference rule discovery module. This module gets situation description, situation features and relevant context information from problem-solving process module. The framework uses association rule mining to discover the association between situation features and  relevant context characteristics. The discovered context-based inference rules is used to infer more relevant problem features in order to assist CBR identify problem situation encountered.

Context-based situation profile discovery module. This module searches the historical log file to discover context-based situation profiles. For specific situations in certain context, relevant information (documents) accessed by workers is recorded in the problem-solving log.

Historical codified knowledge (textual documents) can also provide valuable knowledge for solving the target problem.

Information Retrieval (IR) techniques are used to extract the key terms of relevant documents of a specific situation for certain context. The extracted key terms form the context-based situation profile, which is used to model the information needs of the workers in certain context. The knowledge support system then uses the profile to gather relevant information and help workers solve the target problem.

Knowledge recommendation module. This module recommends relevant situation documents as knowledge support. As noted previously, the context-based situation profiles are used to gather existing and new relevant knowledge documents of a specific situation for certain context. The situation relevant documents help determine the cause of a problem, while the action-relevant documents (operating procedures and guidelines) instruct workers how to solve it. The relevant documents provide practical knowledge support to help workers solve problems.

3. Discovery of problem-solving knowledge  This section describes the procedure of discovering knowledge from historical problem-solving logs. To illustrate the proposed approach, we use data from the log file of a semiconductor foundry?s intranet portal, which contains the problem-solving log for handling problems on the production line. The company operates wafer manufacturing fabs to provide the industry with leading-edge foundry services. The log file records the encountered situation and the action taken. The system also contains profiles accessed by workers for each situation of different context during the problem-solving process. The data fields of the problem-solving log include the situation features and context information.

3.1. Situation identification and case-based reasoning  Each situation or action is a case that is characterized by a text description, situation features and a set of attribute values. The attribute values provide important information      such as the symptoms of a situation to identify the situation/action case. Situation features are analyzed from previous problem situations and can be predefined in system. Such situation features may be collected in run-time by the system or selected by the user. For undefined situation causes, users need to provide a text description of the situation. The text description can be used to extract identifying terms for the situation. Moreover, situation features collected by the system are usually partial and incomplete. Context-based inference can be initiated to infer more situation features. The text descriptions/situation features/attribute values contribute to similarity matching and situation identification. For the target situation, namely, the case workers are currently handling, the system identifies an existing case identifier or retrieves similar cases based on CBR.

Extraction of identifying term vectors. The data stored in the Subject field of an existing case is a text description of the situation. For example, Subject: ?FAB8D Cu-BSC DI Water flow capacity insufficient issue? is the description of the situation - insufficient water flow capacity. The terms extracted from the subject field are used to identify the situation. Note that the terms are extracted using term transformation steps, including case folding, stemming, and stop word removal. We simply extract the terms without considering the term frequency, since the subject field generally contains a short text description. The extracted terms form identifying terms to identify a situation case.

Moreover, the user needs to provide a text description for the target case, namely, the situation or action which he/she is handling. Similarly, the identifying terms of the target case are extracted from the text description using the term transformation steps. Let Tj be the set of identifying terms extracted from the subject field of a situation case Cj. An identifying term vector  is created to represent C  jC j. The weight of a term ti in  is defined by Eq. 1.  jC  ? ? ? ?  = otherwise  Ttif Ctw jiji 0  ),(               (1)  Eq. 2 defines the similarity value simT(Ck, Cj) of two situation cases Ck and Cj based on their text descriptions.

The similarity value is derived by computing the cosine value of the identifying term vectors of Ck and Cj.

For numeric attributes, a data discretization process is conducted to transform their values  into value ranges or user-defined concept terms (such as low, middle or high). Eq. 3 defines the similarity value simA(Ck (attrbx), Cj (attrbx)) of two situation/action cases Ck and Cj,, derived according to their values of attribute x; value(Ck (attrbx)) denotes the transformed value of attribute x of Ck , which is calculated by the discretization process.

The certainty degree of system collected situation feature is set to 1. For inferred situation features, this work employs the method of Certainty Factor (CF) value [17] to derive the certainty degree during the inference, as defined in Eq.

In this work, X denotes the union of run-time situation features and context characteristic; Y is the situation feature that we want to infer its certainty degree. CF(X?Y) is the CF value of rule X?Y. S(Y) is the support of Y. Conf(X?Y) is the confidence of rule X?Y.

For example, The CF value of the context-based inference rule: [Pressure of water unstable] ? [Water supply quantity insufficient] is 0.056. The details of calculation are shown as follows.

[Pressure of water unstable]?[Water supply quantity insufficient]  [Support = 2%, Confidence = 15%]  S([Water supply quantity insufficient]) = 10%  CF([Pressure of water unstable]?[Water supply quantity  insufficient]) = 056.0 %101  %10%15 = ?  ?  Based on the CF value of situation feature, context characteristic, and context-based inference rule, the inference process follows the rules defined in Eq. 6.

Then the inferred knowledge assists CBR in situation identification.

Eq. 8 defines the similarity value simF(Ck, Cj) of two situation cases Ck and Cj based on their situation features. The similarity value is derived by computing the cosine value of the feature vectors of Ck and Cj.

Note that the summation of wT , wF and all wx is equal to 1.

Case-based reasoning for a target case. A target case is a situation that a worker is currently handling. After entering a target case Ck of a situation, the system identifies an existing case identifier of Ck or retrieves similar situation cases if Ck is a new case. The similarity measures between  the target case and previous cases are computed using Eq. 9.

Assume there are n situation identifiers. Let minsim(Ck, Si) be the minimum similarity(Ck, Cj) over all Cj transformed into Si. The procedure finds a situation identifier Sf such that minsim(Ck, Sf) is the maximum of minsim(Ck, Si) over all Si (for i = 1 to r). An existing situation identifier Sf is identified if minsim(Ck, Sf) is greater than ?; otherwise, the situation is a new case and the system assigns a new identifier to it.  The case and its identifier are then stored in the knowledge base, and CBR is initiated to retrieve similar cases based on their similarity measures and to suggest possible knowledge related to the similar cases.

3.2. Discovery of context-based situation profiles  A context-based situation profile is also represented as a term vector which is derived by analyzing the set of documents accessed for handling the situation case in certain context. Each document dj is pre-processed and represented as a term vector  jd . Let denote the set of documents accessed to handle the situation C  CXT SD  S in certain context CXT. A centroid approach is used to derive the profiling term vector  SP of CS by averaging the term vectors  of documents in . Equation 10 defines the weight of a term k  CXT SD  i in SP .

Knowledge support for problem-solving  The system recommends/retrieves relevant knowledge documents to help workers solve problems based on context-based situation profiles. The key contents of a codified knowledge document are represented as a term vector. The situation profile of a case CS is expressed as a profiling term vector  SP . The cosine measure of term vectors is used to derive the similarity measure. Let  jd be the term vector of document dj. The cosine measure of SP and jd , cosine(  SP , jd ), is the similarity measure between the situation and document dj. Documents with the top-N similarity measures are selected as relevant documents.

The knowledge recommendation module suggests relevant documents according to the situation profile of the current situation or similar cases. Note that the top-N relevant documents are recommended according to the cosine measure of the term vectors of the documents and the situation profiles.

5. Conclusions  In this work, we proposed a novel knowledge support framework for problem-solving. Association rule mining is used to discover context-based inference rules from historical problem-solving logs. The discovered patterns identify frequent associations between context information and situation features, and therefore can be used to infer more situation features. By considering the inferred situation features, case-based reasoning can then be employed to identify similar situations effectively.

Moreover, we employ information retrieval techniques to extract context-based situation profiles to model workers' information needs when handling problem situations in certain context. Effective knowledge support can thus be facilitated by providing workers with situation-relevant information based on the profiles.
