Symposium Panel   Big Data in 10 Years  Moderator: Raghu Ramakrishnan, Microsoft  Panel Discussion Abstract:  There is a lot of excitement about ?Big Data? which is at the intersection of the ongoing explosion in data (volumes, variety, and velocity at which it arrives and must be acted upon), the dramatic increase in cost-effective memory capacities, and the maturation of scale-out processing technologies. Huge investments are being made, and there are great expectations for the gains to be had and the range of applications that will be transformed by new data-driven approaches. What does the future hold? Will the changes indeed be transformative, and if so, what will some of the main changes be? What domains are likely to benefit the most? Or is this just a case of unrealistic expectations waiting to be debunked by reality? We will ask panelists drawn from diverse backgrounds to offer their opinions and, hopefully, to get into violent arguments!

Moderator Bio:  Raghu Ramakrishnan joined Microsoft in 2012 as a Technical Fellow and CTO for Information Services, and heads the Cloud and Information Services Lab (CISL) in the Data Platforms Group at Microsoft. From 1987 to 2006, he was a professor at University of Wisconsin-Madison, where he wrote the widely-used text "Database Management Systems" and led a wide range of research projects in database systems (e.g., the CORAL deductive database, the DEVise data visualization tool, SQL extensions to handle sequence data) and data mining (scalable clustering, mining over data streams).

None of this would have been possible without a great group of former students; of all his contributions, he is proudest of this group.In 1999, he founded QUIQ, a company that introduced a cloud-based question-answering service. He joined Yahoo! in 2006 as a Yahoo! Fellow, and over the next six years served as Chief Scientist for the Audience (portal), Cloud and Search divisions, driving content recommendation algorithms (CORE), cloud data stores (PNUTS), and semantic search (?Web of Things?). Ramakrishnan has received several awards, including the ACM SIGKDD Innovations Award, the SIGMOD 10-year Test-of-Time Award, the IIT Madras Distinguished Alumnus Award, and the Packard Fellowship in Science and Engineering. He is a Fellow of the ACM and IEEE.
