Study on Data Mining in First Period of Jiangzhai Site Based on the  Association Algorithms

Abstract   The paper introduces the single-dimensional Boolean association rule based on Apriori algorithm, and the data mining algorithm of the multi- dimensional association rule based on BUC algorithm of MD mode. Afterwards, this paper regards the main relics of Jiangzhai site as the research object, using the very two algorithms to carry out the association mining analysis of the attribute data of Jiangzhai first period cultural relics. At first, it does the attribute association mining on the ancient big, middle and small houses. Then, it does attribute data mining on the pit tomb buried and the urn tomb of the whole site, so as to find the connotative relationships among the attribution data, and provides a new technique for the analysis research of archaeology site information.

1. Introduction   There's plenty of room for improvements in the current field archaeology, and it mainly includes the following aspects: ?With the rapid development of the economy, substantive relic sites are discovered, and large numbers of field archaeologists are busying taking the salvageable mining precept to them. So the field archaeology is very passive. There is a problem deserving of study, which is how to do the designed mining under the direction of experience, and taking it as a part of economic construction. ? By virtue of a long filed archaeological mining period, mass mining data can not be collected in order in time, but kept in the leader of an archaeology team for a long time, so the mining report can not come into being as soon as possible to the public for relevant researchers. How to help the field archaeologists quickly putting the archaeological data in order, exploring knowledge in the mass archaeological data and applying them to  direct the archaeological mining is a very urgent problem that needs to be resolved.

According to the field archaeological data of Jiangzhai settlement of a prehistoric site, this paper studies the data mining with the purpose of resolving these problems stated above, that is, through the attribute data mining, the aim is to find the internal laws of the site and discover the archaeological knowledge to serve the macro planning and the micro speculation in the archaeology.

The Apriori algorithm of R. Agrawal from IBM, one of the association algorithms, has the greatest influence in the field of data mining. The international main researches of association mining have the following aspects. Koperski and Han[1] have ever advanced the algorithm of mining high spatial association rules in geographical information databases, that is to say, using the mode or relation with a higher frequency in the spatial database, and given a two-step spatial optimization technique. Han, Karypis and Kumar[2] have presented two Apriori parallel algorithms, including the intelligent data distribution and mixed classification of mining the association rules. Owing to combine the decision support system with GIS data in the analysis of soil salinity, Ekund, Kirkby and Salim[3] have found the association rule that can be applied to environmental planning and secondary soil salinization monitoring.

Combining the landscape ecology, environment models with GIS, Aspinall and Pearson[4] have researched the environmental conditions of the catchment in American Yellowstone National Park through the integrated geographical assessment, and then discovered the association rule for environment protection. Clementini, Felice and Koperski[5] have mined the multi-level spatial association rule from the wide-boundary spatial objects.

DOI 10.1109/AICI.2009.172     The following are some domestic researches on the association data mining. Cheng Jihua and Shi Pengfei[6] have gotten the mining algorithm of multi- level association rules, using set operation to compute the high-frequency mode, which improves the mining efficiency. Xu Longfei and Yang Xiaoyun[7] have analyzed the mining methods, the mining strategies, and the rule mining language of the generalized association rule model. Tu Xingyuan[8] has studied the mining of association rules based on the numerical value attribute. Cheng Jihua and so on[9] have proposed the mining algorithm of association rules based on the concept. A mining algorithm for generalized association rules based on relation operation by Xiao Li[10], alternating mining association rules on the multi- concept layers. The transition rule mined by Xiao Li, etc.[11] describes the state?s transition in light of a definite probability from the current  period of the system to its next, and the state of the next period is depended on the state and transition probability of the prophase. Zhu Ming, Wang Junpu and Cai Qingshen[12] have advanced a heuristic search algorithm of an optimal characteristic set on the basis of the example characteristic matrix, and compared it with the greedy algorithm[13] of the characteristic selection. Ding Xiangwu[14] has increased the temporal information that describes the timeliness of the association rule into the association rule model. Zuo wanli[15] has studied the technology of type conversion that extractes the association rule from the databases containing category attributes.

2. The association rule algorithm  2.1. The mining of single-dimensional Boolean association rules   Apriori algorithm is the most influential algorithm to mine frequent items of Boolean association rule.

The classical Apriori algorithm divides the design of the association rule mining algorithm into two steps.

?The first step is to find all the items, whose supports are greater than the minimum, and these composed of K numbers of frequent items are called K-item set. ? The second is to take advantage of these frequent items found in the first step to produce anticipant rules. For  each frequent item A, if B ? A, then B? , and if Confidence (B? (A-B)) ? the minimum confidence (minconf), then the association rule B? (A-B) is formed.

The second step is relatively simple because there is only one item on the right side of the rule. If a given frequent item is Y=I1, I2,?, Ik , k?2, Ij?I, then, there are at most K numbers of rules whose items are only  contained in the set {I1, I2, ?, Ik}, and the rule is shaped as I1, I2, ?, Ii-1, Ii+1, ?, Ik?Ii, 1?i?k. Among these rules, only those whose confidences are greater than the minimum confidence given by users are left.

The recursive method is used in the Apriori algorithm so as to produce all frequent items, and the pseudocode is as follows: Input: D, the minimum support (minsup) Output: Result = all the frequent items and their supports.

Method: L1={large 1-itemsets}; for (k=2;Lk?1??;k++) do begin Ck=apriori-gen(Lk-1); for all transaction items transactions t?D do begin Ct=subset(Ck,t); for all candidate items candidates c?Ct do c?count++; end Lk={c?Ck|c?count? minsup} end Result=?kLk.

2.2. The mining of the multi-dimensional association rules   During the time of mining the multi-dimensional database, the association among the multi-dimensional attributes frequently attracts many more attentions. In general, it imports the first-order logical predicate to express the multi-dimensional association rule, among which the predicate denotes the dimension, and one item of predicates represents a certain object and the others represent certain attributes of the dimension.

The multi-dimensional association rules can be divided into the association rule among different dimensions and the mixed-dimensional association rule, according to the principle that the same dimension whether occurs repeatedly in the same rule., and the former rule doesn't allow the same dimension to occur repeatedly, while the latter allows the same dimension to occur on both two sides of the rule at the same time.

The type of attributes should be considered when multi-dimensional association rules are mined. The database attribute can fall into the classification attribute, also called the nominal attribute, and numerical quantification attribute. The classification attribute has finite different values without order, while there is connotative order among quantification attributes. All of previous classification algorithms can be applied to the classification attribute, but some pretreatments are needed when it comes to the quantification attribute. In light of the methods of dealing with quantification attributes, the association     rules related to quantification attributes can be divided into statistic association rule, quantification association rule, and association rule based on distances and so on.

2.3. The improved BUC (Bottom-Up Computation) algorithm   The structure of multi-dimensional transaction database D is defined as (ID,A1,A2,?,An, items).ID is the sole identifier of every transaction in the database, Ai is the structural attribute of the database, and the items is the set of all the items connected with the given transaction. The information contained in every transaction T=(id,a1,a2,?,an, items-t) falls into two parts: dimension (a1,a2,?,an)and item set (items-t).The mining process contains two parts. In the first, it mines the mode on dimensional information, and then, it searches the frequent item sets in the projected sub- database and vice versa. The first step is demonstrated by the multi-dimensional database in table 1.

First of all, it searches the combination of the frequent multi-dimensional values, and then finds out the corresponding frequent item sets from the database.

Given that the threshold value in database D in table 1 is 2. Afterwards, if the combination of attribute values occurs twice or more than twice, it is frequent, and is called the multi-dimensional mode or MD mode.

During the mining of MD mode, the improved BUC algorithm pioneered by Beyer and Ramakrishnan as can be used to do it. The basal approaches of the BUC algorithm are as follows[18].

Table 1. The multi-dimensional transaction database D  ID A1 A2 A3 items 01 a 1 m x,y,z 02 b 2 n z,w 03 a 2 m x,z,w 04 c 3 p x,w  Order the every item in the first dimension (A1) in alphabetical order of values. Because the value of attribute A1 is expressed by christcross-row, the order is alphabetical rather than depending on the digital.

?The only MD mode in this dimension is (a,*,*), because of only the value of ?a? occurs twice. Owing to the other values of ?b? and ?c? occur only once, they don?t belong to MD mode. The value (*) of the other two dimensions means that there is not relations in the first step, and it can be combined by the allowed values without order. Choose those items owning the MD mode in the database, and they are the samples with ID 01 and 03 in this example. As concerning the second dimension A2, the values are 1 and 2 respectively, and reorder the predigested database. Because there is not a mode appearing twice, there are not MD mode with the  values A1 and A2, and  the second dimension A2  can be ignored, which can not predigest the database any more.

In the next step, all the selective items will be used.

Order every item in the third dimension (A3) in alphabetical order, the sub-group (a,*,m) is contained in two items and is a MD mode. Because there is no other dimension in this example, the second step can start.

?Repeating the process of the first step, it searches MD mode from the second dimension not the first. In the following iterative process, it is not necessary to search the first dimension, so it reduces the search process at the very start. In this example, the second iteration begins from the attribute A2, and the MD mode is (*,2,*). There is no other MD mode except the dimension A3. The last iteration in this example begins from dimension A3, and the corresponding MD mode is (*,*,m).

It is obvious that, the improved BUC algorithm defines a set of MD modes and the corresponding database projection. When all of the MD modes are found, it starts to analyze the next step of the multi- dimensional transaction database, that is, it makes use of the Apriori algorithm and so on to mine the frequent item sets on each MD mode in MD projection. Another method is to mine the frequent item sets, and just after that, it mines the corresponding MD mode.

3. The data mining result and analysis for Jiangzhai site in first period culture   Jiangzhai site is located in Lintong District of Shaanxi Province, southwest close to Linhe River, south cling to Lishan Mountain, and north near to Weishui River. It is a Neolithic settlement site, belonging to the type of Banpo in the culture of Yangshao. The official excavation of Jiangzhai site lasted 8 years from 1972 to 1979, total 11 scientific excavations, and found a large number of important relics, such as houses, cellars, moats, tombs, fences, the pottery of stoves and so on [16].

3.1. Data mining on houses   All houses in the entire site in accordance with the given minimum support and minimum confidence, in light of the direction of the door, the group, the age, are carried out the association data mining combined with the related attributes[19], and three association rules of combinations are gained Here only shows the result of the association data mining in house age:  The following are the three-dimensional association rules of house age and the shape and the form (The     minimum support is 7%, and the minimum confidence is 15%).

Table 2.

But in the middle period, the half-crypt and square house have the same proportion with the ground and rotund house.

3.2. Data mining on pit tombs   All pit tombs in the entire site in accordance with the given minimum support and minimum confidence, in light of the tomb section, the tomb direction, the burial style, and the head direction are carried out the association data mining combined with the related attributes[19], and five association rules of combinations are gained Here shows the result of the association data mining on the tomb section, the burial style and the related attributes.

3.2.1. The association data mining on the tomb section and related attributes  (1)The following are relations of the ID of the tomb section and the head direction (The minimum support is 6%, and the minimum confidence is 15%).

The tombs in section I, II mostly head for west. The head direction in area III is different, some head for southwest and some for northwest or west to south.

The numbers of tombs whose head direction are for west to south in area II are the same with tombs whose head direction are for west to north in area I.

Table 3.  Relations of the ID of the tomb selection and head direction Rule 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  Location ? ? ? ? ? ? ?

Data mining on urn tombs   All urn tombs in the entire site in accordance with the given minimum support and minimum confidence, in light of the placement and the age are carried out the association data mining combined with the related attributes[19], and kinds of association rules of combinations are gained. The following are relations of the placement and the age (The minimum support is 6%, and the minimum confidence is 15%).

These rules show that the placements of the urn tombs of infants and little children are mostly upright, but some urn tombs of infants are obliquely-placed.
