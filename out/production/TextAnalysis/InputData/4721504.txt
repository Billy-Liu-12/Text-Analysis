An Evolving Information System Based on Data Mining Knowledge  to Support Customer Relationship Management

Abstract It is becoming more vital than ever before for business to manage customer relationship and build customer loyalty.

Information systems and data mining techniques have significant contributions in the customer relationship management process.  In the dynamic business environment, information systems need to evolve to adapt to the change in requirements, which is driven by customer relationship management.  An evolving information system is proposed in this paper and discussed by focusing on a specific type of knowledge, namely association rule. With new classes and attributes created based on new knowledge and user requirements, the evolving information system is capable of collecting, processing and providing more valuable information on customers, to support customer relationship management.

1. Introduction   Nowadays it is becoming more vital than ever for business to build and maintain customer relationships, and customer relationship management (CRM) has been a hot-button issue for business. It is especially imperative for retailers to have an effective and efficient CRM system since they are competing for ultimate consumers? share of wallet. Only those who know exactly what, when, and how much their customers need can deliver the right product to the right customer at the right time through the right channel to satisfy customers? demands, and consequently can they obtain and retain customers for sustained profits and continuing growth. CRM usually follows a two-step process of learning customer insights, and designing and executing the best CRM campaign, in which the learning step has been increasingly crucial and challenging especially in such a dynamic business environment. [10]  Information technologies and techniques, such as data mining techniques, OLAP techniques, have been applied widely in the CRM learning process and proven to be powerful approaches for business to build and manage customer relationships [8]. Data mining is the process of  automatically discovering implicit knowledge from tremendous volumes of data, and the discovered knowledge reveals customers? preference, behavior, etc., and CRM campaigns are designed and executed accordingly. It is not supposed to stop with the campaign (i.e., campaign-centric [9]), but to look further into the behavior patterns and special groups of customers, namely, to be customer-centric, so as to get the most out of the discovered knowledge. For example, the ?beer and diaper? story tells that customers who buy diapers tend also to buy beer, which enables managers to design and execute CRM programs, like cross-selling promotion, layout design.

When we looked into the special group of customers, it was found that most of them are young men buying diapers for their babies after working hours and by the way buying beer for themselves. The profile of this group (i.e., age, gender, transaction time) could be useful for managers to develop more effective service, besides simply putting beer and diaper together. It is obvious this further study on customers may add unexpected value to business and consequently improve the efficiency and effectiveness of CRM.

As one of the absolutely necessary building blocks of CRM, information systems provide the access to transaction data, business information, etc. in daily operations as well as in the above-mentioned further study process. However, it is likely that the data needed in the further study process is unavailable in the existing information system. Thus, information systems need to evolve to adapt to the data requirements, and consequently to support CRM. This paper proposes a framework of an evolving information system based on knowledge discovered from data mining, in order to more favorably support CRM. It is illustrated how an information system evolves based on a specific type of knowledge from data mining, association rule (AR) [1]. The discussion is based on the Entity-Relationship (ER) model [4], which has been widely accepted and used as one of the standard tools in static modeling of information systems, and the AR-Enriched ER (AR-EER) model, which is an extension     of the ER model by introducing semantics from association rules, and achieves expressiveness through capturing information implicit previously. It is shown that new classes are created at the conceptual level and then propagated into the information system, so as to provide new data and functions for CRM.

It is worth noting that knowledge to be considered in the evolution will be under careful surveillance not to be trivial in terms of suitability of knowledge. Here by suitability we mean a number of factors such as importance, interestingness, and stability.

The following is organized as follows. Related research is introduced in section 2 and section 3 formulates the framework of the evolving information system based on knowledge discovered from data mining. The framework is specially discussed in section 4 in the context of association rules, with a scenario of a department store as an illustration.

The paper is concluded in section 5.

2. Related work   As one of the most basic and important data mining techniques, association rule mining discovers the items co-occurring frequently, and thus becomes popular in market basket analysis in retailing business through the ?beer and diaper? story. Research has been focused on mining association rules in a more efficient way (e.g.,[11]), and discovering various forms of association rules (e.g.,[3][7]), such as ?customers in ABC district tend to buy products with price above 300 RMB?, which reflects associations between addresses of customers and prices of products. While these academic and practical efforts make contributions to campaign-centric CRM activities, as discussed above, it has been deemed necessary to reflect knowledge discovered from data mining into existing systems [4]. More specifically, association rules discovered in large databases have been proposed to enrich the ER model, introducing specializations and sub-classes to reflect semantics from association rules, and resulting in AR-Enriched ER (AR-EER) model [2].

Design of information systems refers to different levels, namely, conceptual, logical, and physical. Conceptual schemas are usually built first and then transformed into logical schemas and finally to physical schemas. At the conceptual level, an ER schema consists of a set of entity classes and relationship classes between/among them, which are defined as sets and thus at a certain moment containing certain instances (resp., entities and relationships). An entity/relationship class is described by a set of attributes, which maps entities and relationships to values in the associated value sets. Specialization is an important mechanism in AR-EER model. An entity specialization (i.e., E-specialization) or a relationship specialization (i.e., R-specialization) defines sub-classes on an entity/relationship class in the sense that the instances of  a sub-class are definitely the instances of its super-class.

Additional attributes can be defined on new sub-classes, if necessary, to accommodate additional data. Then new sub-classes are transformed into constructs of physical schemas (i.e., tables and dependencies/constraints of the relational database model).

3. An evolving information system based on data mining   As far as data mining is concerned, the process of CRM usually follows learning and decision-making steps, as shown by solid lines in Figure 1. Since domain knowledge reveals interesting associations or patterns, which could drive an in-depth investigation of specified customer groups or behavior patterns, it is meaningful to do further study rather than to stop with CRM campaign. On conditions that existing data is not enough for further study, survey will be conducted and additional data will be collected into the information system for understanding the customers and/or patterns. Thus a close cycle of an evolving information system is established, rather than a stream from information systems to CRM campaign. The proposed evolving part is shown by dashed box and lines in Figure 1. The life cycle of evolving information systems is described as follows:  a. Data mining We start with an existing information system with large  amount of data accumulated. Data mining techniques such as association rule, classification, and clustering can be applied to data on customers, transactions, etc., and discover implicit, previously hidden but potentially useful knowledge. This task is to be accomplished by technical experts (i.e., data mining specialists).

b. Explaining The knowledge discovered in the first step is in technical  format and needs to be explained by experts who have specific domain knowledge, into domain knowledge understandable to managers. These two steps are the learning process.

c. Decision making Management will make CRM decisions based on  domain knowledge and develop CRM campaigns accordingly, which is expected to meet certain objectives, such as offering high quality products and/or services to customers, generating repeating purchases, and promoting customer loyalty, etc.

d. Executing Designed CRM campaigns are executed by managers,  and target products/services are delivered to target customers. The four steps from a to d depict how data mining currently contributes in CRM.

e. Focusing Managers may be interested in certain customers and  behaviors, thus calling for a further study. Some questions     from them can be answered with the help of existing systems while others not, and so data requirement is generated. This task is to be accomplished by managers together with experts.

f. Surveying Managers design and conduct survey to get interaction  with target customers. Questionnaires with data requirement are sent to customers through email, ?pop-out? on the website, or directly. Target data is accumulated accordingly.

g. (New) data collecting Data collecting is traditionally concerned with  transactions; new data collecting refers to the data needed by managers but unavailable in the existing information system, and then collected through customer surveys. New data collecting leads to the evolution of information systems, which will be discussed in the next section.

4. Conceptual schemas based on association rules   In this part the foregoing framework will be discussed in the context of association rules, and then a scenario of a department store is given as an illustration.

4.1. From an ER schema to an AR-EER schema   An ER schema S consists of a set of entity types and relationship types, denoted as E and R respectively. An entity class Ei?E is described by a set of attributes A(Ei), and each attribute A? A(Ei) is associated with a value set, dom(A). A relationship type Rj?R is described by a set of  attributes A(R) as well as its participants with distinct roles in Rj. For the sake of simplicity, this paper discusses binary relationship types with participants being two entity types.

Suppose association rules with two items are of the form <P1, p1>? <P2, p2>, where <Pi, pi> is an item, Pi is a descriptive property of an object, and pi is a singleton or a subset of dom(Pi), for example, <address, LA> ? <price, [80,?)>. An association rule results in E-specialization and R-specialization in an AR-EER schema. Corresponding sub-classes are of the form:    <A, >Ei v ={e | AV ( )e ?v, e?Ei, A?A(Ei), v ?Dom(A)} where <A, >Ei v  is a sub-class of Ei based on an attribute A and a value set1 v ? Dom(A), and  AV ( )e  denotes the value that an entity e takes on attribute A. An example can be a sub-class of Customer containing a group of customers with age under 30, denoted as Customer<age,under 30>.

I <A, >R v = {r | AV ( )r ?v, r?R, A?A(R), v ?Dom(A)}.

II <A, >R v = {r=(e1, e2) | A 1V ( )e ?v, e1?E1, e2?E2, r?R,  A?A(E1), v?Dom(A)}, or equivalently,  R?= {r=(e1, e2) | e1? 1 <A, >E v , e2?E2, r?R}.

where I <A, >R v and  II <A, >R v  are two basic forms of sub-class  of a relationship, based on an attribute of a relationship type, or an attribute of its participant. Examples can be a sub-class of order (between Customer and Product) containing a group of orders on weekends (i.e., order<day, weekend>), or a sub-type of order referring to those ordered by young customers (i.e., order<Customer.age, young>). An AR with two items corresponds to an R-specialization based on more than one attributes, which are combination of basic specializations. In the following rules are given to define sub-classes in an AR-EER schema, with three cases categorized with respect to whether the properties of items are related to an entity class or a relationship class. As one association rule is concerned, the related entity classes are supposed to be participants of the related relationship class for simplicity, that is, the ER constructs related by one association rule are supposed to be Rj(Ei, Ek). The Trigger part depicts the conditions on which a rule is active, and the Operation part lists operations to evolve an ER schema into an AR-EER schema when the rule is triggered.

Rule1: //Properties related to two attributes of entity.

[Trigger] P1= Ei.Aim, P2= Ek.Akt, p1?Dom(Aim),  p2 ?Dom(Akt) [Operation]  CREATE ( CLASS Ep IN E | SUB-CLASS-OF Ei )  CREATE ( CLASS Eq IN E   1 Here v is supposed to be a subset of the value set. It can also be a singleton in the value set.

Figure 1.  An evolving information system based on data mining     | SUB-CLASS-OF Ek ) CREATE ( CLASS Rs IN R | RELATIONSHIP  Rs  Ep : role a | RELATIONSHIP  Rs  Eq : role b | SUB-CLASS-OF Rj WHERE Rj(Ei,Ek) )  Rule2: //Properties related to an attribute of entity and one of relationship.

[Trigger] P1= Rj.Ajt, P2= Ei.Aim, p1 ?Dom(Ajt), p2 ?Dom(Aim) [Operation]  CREATE ( CLASS Ep IN E | SUB-CLASS-OF Ei )  CREATE ( CLASS Rs IN R | RELATIONSHIP  Rs  Ep : role a | RELATIONSHIP  Rs  Ek : role b | SUB-CLASS-OF Rj )  Rule3: //Properties related to two attributes of relationship [Trigger] P1= Rj.Ajm, P2= Rj.Ajn, p1?Dom(Ajm), p2?Dom(Ajn) [Operation]  CREATE ( CLASS Rs IN R | RELATIONSHIP  Rs  Ei : role a | RELATIONSHIP  Rs  Ek : role b | SUB-CLASS-OF Rj )     It is illustrated in Figure 2 how ER constructs evolve  when a rule (i.e., Rule1) is triggered. Once AR items are related to ER entity/relationship classes as stated in Trigger of a rule, sub-classes are created, including sub-class of entity and/or sub-class of relationship. The sub-classes in Figure 2 are defined as follows:  )}Dom(A),E(A,E,)(V|{E 11Aim imiimip pAepee ????=  )}Dom(A),E(A,E,)(V|{E 22Akt ktkktkq pAepee ????=  }R,E,E,)(V,)(V| {R 2122A11A21 ktim jkis reepepe), e(er ?????== or equivalently, }R,E,E| {R 2121 jqps ree), e(er ???==  4.2. An example   An example of a department store is shown in Figure 3.

Customers order products, and receive mobile-phone short messages from the store, which promote certain products.

E={Customer, Product, SMS} R={order(Customer, Product), receive(Customer, SMS), promote(SMS, Product)} A(Customer) ={C#, name, rewards} A(Product)={P#, pname, brand, price} A(SMS)={content} A(order) ={o_day, o_time, amount} A(receive) ={r_day, r_time} A(promote) ={startday, endday}    The following will show how the foregoing framework  works. Association rule mining is applied on the transaction data by customers (i.e., member-card holders) in last two years and association rules are obtained such as:  <rewards, above6000> ? <brand, ESPRIT> Dconf=0.57, Dsupp=0.006.

The rule tells that customers who have obtained more than 6000 rewards will buy ESPRIT products, which may be of interest to managers.  A promotion (like SMS about ESPRIT) could be sent to those customers, which could be attractive to them.

Besides, interesting questions can also be asked, like how old are these customers buying ESPRIT? What are their hobbies? Then a further study may be driven to better understand their high-end customers. Data requirements are formulated as:  age of customers buying ESPRIT hobby of customers buying ESPRIT  According to Rule 1, we have the following operations:  [Trigger] brand = Product.brand, rewards=Customer. rewards, ESPRTI ?Dom(brand), above6000 ?Dom(rewards) [Operation]  CREATE ( CLASS Customer? IN E  Figure 2.  Illustration of rule 1  Figure 3.  An ER schema     | SUB-CLASS-OF Customer ) CREATE ( CLASS Product? IN E  | SUB-CLASS-OF Product ) CREATE ( CLASS order? IN R | RELATIONSHIP  order?  Customer? | RELATIONSHIP  order?  Product?) | SUB-CLASS-OF order WHERE order(Customer, Product))   Customer? ={e |Vrewards(e)?(6000,?), e?Customer} Product? ={e |Vbrand(e)?{ESPRIT}, e?Product } order? ={r=(e1,e2)| e1?Customer?, e2? Product ?, r?order}   Figure 4 depicts the evolved part where three  sub-classes and two attributes hobby, age are added into a conceptual schema. At the logical level, new tables will be created in the schema (i.e., the relational database schema) for new data to be stored.

5. Conclusion   In the dynamic business environment, information systems need to evolve to adapt to new requirements, which may be driven by CRM. The paper has presented a framework of an evolving information system based on knowledge from data mining, and has discussed the framework by focusing on knowledge of association rules.

The AR-EER model, with specializations and sub-classes created based on the ER model, achieves more expressiveness by capturing information which is of business value but is implicit previously, so that the resulting information system is capable of collecting, processing and providing more accurate information about customers? profile and behavioral pattern to better support CRM. The evolution based on knowledge from data mining, as far as it is discussed in this paper, induces a low cost since it up till now does not reengineer original schemas but creates new sub-classes and additional attributes, and  attempts to do this in an automated manner according to a set of rules.
