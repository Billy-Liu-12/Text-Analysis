Remarks to Logical Aspects of Measures of Interestingness of Association Rules

Abstract?Relations of logical calculi of association rules to measures of interestingness of association rules are studied.

Logical calculi of association rules, 4ft-quantifiers and important classes of association rules are briefly introduced. New 4ft- quantifiers and association rules are defined by applications of suitable thresholds to several known measures of interestingness.

It is proved that some of new 4ft-quantifiers constitute rules that belong to known classes of rules. It is shown that new interesting classes of rules can be defined on the basis of additional new 4ft-quantifiers. Some additional results concerning new classes of rules are proved. Open problems are introduced.



I. INTRODUCTION  The goal of this paper is to contribute to mathematical foundations of data mining. We try to find relation between two topics concerning association rules ? measures of inter- estingness of association rules and logical deduction among association rules.

The association rule is usually considered as an implication X ? Y where X and Y are conjunctions of simple Boolean attributes as defined in [8]. An example of association rule is the expression u ? v ? x ? y which can be interpreted such that if market basket contains items u and v then it usually contains also items x and y. Two basic interestingness mea- sures of the rule X ? Y are used ? confidence and support.

Additional interestingness measures and their properties are widely studied; see e.g. [1], [2], [3], [4], [5].

We deal with a bit more general association rules of the form ? ? ? where ? and ? are general Boolean attributes derived using propositional connectives ?, ?, and ?. The rule ? ? ? means that ? and ? are associated in the way given by the symbol ? that is called 4ft-quantifier. Each 4ft-quantifier is related to a condition concerning contingency table of ? and ?. Note that there are data mining procedures mining for such general association rules [6], [7]. These procedures do not use well known apriori algorithm [8], their implementation is based on representation of analyzed data by strings of bits [6].

Logical calculi formulas of which correspond to such as- sociation rules were defined and studied in [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]. There are important results on deduction rules of the form ???????? where ?, ?, ?  ?, and ?? are general Boolean attributes. Additional both theoretically interesting and practically important results were also achieved.

We can derive the 4ft-quantifier from each of measures of interestingness studied in [1], [2], [3], [4], [5] by application of suitable thresholds for their values. Thus there is a natural  question concerning relation of 4ft-quantifiers defined this way to the results concerning logical calculi of association rules of the form ? ? ? mentioned above. We are namely interested in results concerning deduction rules because of their importance.

Most of interesting results on association rules of the form ? ? ? are related to classes of association rules. The association rule ? ? ? belongs to the class of equivalence rules if and only if the 4ft-quantifier ? belongs to the class of equivalence 4ft-quantifiers etc. However application of suitable thresholds to some important measures of interestingness of association rules does not yield the 4ft-quantifiers belonging to known classes. Thus there is a second natural question if it is possible to define new classes of 4ft-quantifiers (i.e. classes of association rules) containing quantifiers that do not belong to known classes. We are of course interested in properties of new classes.

This paper tries to get answer to the above outlined two natural questions. The detailed answer is however out of the scope of the paper, thus only partial answers are given and open questions are listed. The structure of the paper is as follows. Logical calculi of association rules are outlined in Sect. II, an overview of classes of association rules is given in Sect. III and the important results concerning classes of association rules are summarized in Sect. IV. New 4ft- quantifiers derived from important measures of interestingness are introduced in Sect. V. New classes of association rules are defined and studied in Sect. VI and VII. Conclusions and list of open questions are in Sect. VIII.



II. LOGICAL CALCULI OF ASSOCIATION RULES  Logical calculi of association rules belong to observational calculi defined and studied in [9] as a language in which statements concerning observational data are formulated. Spe- cial case of observational calculi are monadic observational predicate calculi that are modifications of classical monadic predicate calculi [21]. Modifications consists in adding gen- eralized quantifiers (e.g. 4ft-quantifiers, see below) and in allowing only finite structures as models in which the formulas are interpreted. The predicate calculi were enhanced to calculi with qualitative values in [9]. The calculi with qualitative values were simplified in [16] such that only formulas of the form ? ? ? corresponding to association rules mentioned in Sect. I are allowed. These calculi can be understood as calculi of association rules.

DOI 10.1109/ICDM.Workshops.2008.47    DOI 10.1109/ICDMW.2008.45     The Boolean attributes ? and ? are derived from the columns of the analyzed data matrix M. We assume there is a finite number of possible values for each column of M.

Columns are called attributes, possible values of the attributes are called categories. Basic Boolean attributes are created first.

The basic Boolean attribute is an expression of the form A(?) where ? ? {a1, . . . ak} and {a1, . . . ak} is the set of all possible categories of A. The basic Boolean attribute A(?) is true in the row o of M if it is A(o) ? ? where A(o) is the value of the attribute A in the row o. Boolean attributes ? and ? are derived from basic Boolean attributes using propositional connectives ?, ?, and ? in the usual way. An example of the data matrix with the columns - attributes A, B, C, . . . is the data matrix M in Fig. 1. There are also examples of the basic Boolean attributes A(5) and C(2, 3) in Fig. 1.

The four-fold contingency table 4ft(?,?,M) (the 4ft table for short) of ? and ? in the data matrix M is the quadruple ?a, b, c, d? of natural numbers such that a is the number of rows of M satisfying both ? and ?, b is the number of rows of M satisfying ? and not satisfying ? etc.; see Tab. I.

TABLE I 4FT TABLE 4ft(?,?,M) OF ? AND ? IN M  M ? ?? ? a b  ?? c d  An example of association rule is the rule  D(d1) ?A(a1, a3) ?+q,B B(b2) ? C(c4, c6) in which the 4ft-quantifier ?+q,Base of above average depen- dence (i.e. the AA-quantifier) [6] is used. This quantifier is associated to the condition aa+b ? (1+q) a+ca+b+c+d?a ? Base.

Thus if the rule ? ?+p,Base ? is true in the data matrix M then it is true that the relative frequency of rows satisfying ? among rows satisfying ? (i.e. aa+b ) is at least 100p per cent higher than relative frequency of rows satisfying ? among all rows of analyzed data matrix (i.e. a+ca+b+c+d ) and moreover there are at least Base rows satisfying both ? and ?.

An other example of the 4ft-quantifier is the quantifier ?C,S corresponding to the condition aa+b ? C ? aa+b+c+d ? S.

The rule ? ?C,S ? is the ?classical? association rule with confidence C and support S as defined in [8]. A variant of the 4ft-quantifier ?C,S is the quantifier ?p,Base of founded implication [9] defined by the condition aa+b ? p? a ? Base for 0 < p ? 1 and Base ? 0. Additional examples of 4ft- quantifiers are in Sect. V.



III. CLASSES OF ASSOCIATION RULES  There are various classes of association rules defined and studied in [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [20]. The association rule ? ? ? is implicational if the 4ft-quantifier ? is one of the implication quantifiers. This is the same for additional classes of association rules. The results presented in this paper concern classes of implicational rules, double implicational rules, equivalence rules, and rules with F-property. Their definitions are mentioned in this section. There are however also additional classes of association rules, see e.g. [14]. Note that examples of 4ft-quantifiers of particular classes are given in Tab. IV in Sect. V.

The association rule ? ? ? is true in the data matrix M if the condition given by the 4ft-quantifier ? is satisfied in the 4ft-table 4ft(?,?,M) of ? and ? in M, see Sect. II. We can define a {0, 1}-valued function F? for each 4ft-quantifier such that it is F?(a, b, c, d) = 1 if the condition associated to ? is satisfied for ?a, b, c, d?, otherwise F?(a, b, c, d) = 0.

The function F? is called associated function of the 4ft- quantifier ? [9]. We write usually only ? (a, b, c, d) instead of F?(a, b, c, d).

The class of implicational quantifiers is defined in [9]. The 4ft quantifier ? is implicational if  ? (a, b, c, d) = 1 ? a? ? a ? b? ? b implies ? (a?, b?, c?, d?) = 1 for all 4ft-tables ?a, b, c, d? and ?a?, b?, c?, d??. The condition a? ? a ? b? ? b is called truth preservation condition for implicational quantifiers, it is denoted as TPC?. Note that the TPC? condition means that the 4ft-table ?a?, b?, c?, d?? is ?better from the point of view of implication? than the 4ft-table ?a, b, c, d? (i-better [9]).

The class of double implicational quantifiers is defined in [16]. The 4ft quantifier ? is double implicational if  ? (a, b, c, d) = 1 ? a? ? a ? b? ? b ? c? ? c implies ? (a?, b?, c?, d?) = 1 for all 4ft-tables ?a, b, c, d? and ?a?, b?, c?, d??. The condition a? ? a ? b? ? b ? c? ? c is called truth preservation condition for double implicational quantifiers, it is denoted as TPC?.

An important role in definitions of the 4ft-quantifiers ?p, ?!p,? and ??p,? (see rows 17 ? 19 in Tab. IV) plays the sum b+c. This led to the definition of ?-double implicational quan- tifiers in [16]. The 4ft quantifier ? is ?-double implicational if  ? (a, b, c, d) = 1 ? a? ? a ? b? + c? ? b+ c implies ? (a?, b?, c?, d?) = 1 for all 4ft-tables ?a, b, c, d? and ?a?, b?, c?, d??. The condition a? ? a ? b? + c? ? b+ c is called the truth preservation condition for ?-double implicational quantifiers, it is denoted as TPC??.

In [9] there is defined the class of associational quantifiers such that the 4ft quantifier ? is associational if ? (a, b, c, d) = 1 ? a? ? a ? b? ? b ? c? ? c ? d? ? d implies ? (a?, b?, c?, d?) = 1 for all 4ft-tables ?a, b, c, d? and ?a?, b?, c?, d??. However it is proved in [16] that the ?classical? association rule ? ?C,S ? with the confidence C and the support S defined in [8] is not associational     according to this definition. To avoid problems with the fact that ?classical? association rule ? ?C,S ? is not associ- ational we use the term class of equivalence rules instead of class of associational rules. We denote the condition a? ? a ? b? ? b ? c? ? c ? d? ? d as TPC?, we call it the truth preservation condition for equivalence quantifiers.

The class of ?-equivalence quantifiers is defined in [16], see also [11] such that the 4ft quantifier ? is ?-equivalence if  ? (a, b, c, d) = 1 ? a? + d? ? a+ d ? b? + c? ? b+ c implies ? (a?, b?, c?, d?) = 1 for all 4ft-tables ?a, b, c, d? and ?a?, b?, c?, d??. The condition a?+d? ? a+d ? b?+c? ? b+c is the truth preservation condition for ?-equivalence quantifiers and it is denoted as TPC??.

The class of association rules with F-property [13] is defined such that the 4ft quantifier ? has the F-property if it satisfies:  1) If ? (a, b, c, d) = 1 and b ? c? 1 ? 0 then ? (a, b+ 1, c? 1, d) = 1.

2) If ? (a, b, c, d) = 1 and c ? b? 1 ? 0 then ? (a, b? 1, c+ 1, d) = 1.



IV. RESULTS ON CLASSES OF ASSOCIATION RULES  There are various results concerning properties of logical calculi of association rules published in [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [20]. They concern namely the following topics.

? Deduction rules of the form ???????? where both ? ? ? and ?? ? ?? are association rules.

? Definability of association rules in classical predicate calculi, an overview of results is given in [15].

? Application of principle of secured extension to evalua- tion of association rules in calculi with missing informa- tion. This approach was developed in [9], an overview of related results is in [14].

? Tables of critical frequencies that are tools for avoid- ing complex computation related to 4ft-quantifiers cor- responding to some of statistical hypothesis tests, an overview of related results is in [14]. Tables of critical frequencies have however also relation to definability of association rules in classical predicate calculi [15].

All these results are closely related to classes of association rules mentioned in Sect. III. We present here some more details only for deduction rules because of their importance and limited space. For additional information on results on deduction rules see [12], [14].

As mentioned, we are interested in deduction rules of the form ???????? where both ? ? ? and ?? ? ?? are association rules. Such deduction rule is by definition correct if it is true for each data matrix M: If ? ? ? is true in M then also ?? ? ?? is true in M.

An example of simple correct deduction rule is the rule P1?p,BaseP2  P1?p,BaseP2?P3 where P1, P2, P3 are predicates [9]. It is  easy to verify that an analogous deduction rule P1?C,SP2P1?C,SP2?P3 concerning classical association rules is also correct.

An other example of correct deduction rule concerning association rules is the deduction rule  D(d1)?A(a1,a3)?p,BB(b2)?C(c4,c6) D(d1)?A(a1,a3)?p,BB(b2,b5,b7)?C(c4,c6,c9) . Its correctness follows from a theorem proved in [12]. This theorem says that there is an important subclass of interesting implicational quantifiers and formulas ?1(?,?, ??, ??), ?2(?,?, ??, ??), and ?3(?,?) of propositional calculus such that the deduction rule ???????? with interesting implicational quantifier? is correct if and only if (i) or (ii) are satisfied:  (i) both ?1(?,?, ??, ??) and ?2(?,?, ??, ??) are tau- tologies  (ii) ?3(?,?) is the tautology.

For more information see also Sect. VI-D. There are similar results for ?-double implicational, ?-equivalence quantifiers [12] and for quantifiers with F-property [13].

There are at least the following possibilities of applications of results concerning deduction rules of the form ???????? .

Reduction of the output of a data mining procedure: If the association rule ? ? ? is a part of a data mining procedure output (thus it is true in an analyzed data matrix) and if ???????? is the correct deduction rule then it is not necessary to put the association rule ?? ? ?? into the output. The used deduction rule must be transparent enough from the point of view of the user of the data mining procedure. Research on transparent deduction rules of this form is in [18].

Decreasing the number of actually tested rules: If the association rule ? ? ? is true in the analyzed data matrix and if ???????? is the correct deduction rule, then it is not necessary to test ?? ? ??. This approach is hard to apply in the apriori algorithm but it is applied in the algorithm based on representation of analyzed data by string of bits [6].

Manipulation with analytical reports: One of way how to present results of data mining to the user is to arrange the results into well structured analytical report. The core of such report is a sequence of patterns resulting from applications of data mining procedure. It has sense to try to find a ?logical skeleton? of such analytical report and to deal only with ?logical skeletons? instead of whole reports. This way we can try to communicate the analytical reports even on Semantic Web. Some preliminary considerations on these possibilities are in [22]. Deduction rules (not only of the form ???????? ) play important role in finding ?logical skeletons? of analytical reports.



V. MEASURES OF INTERESTINGNESS AND 4FT-QUANTIFIERS  This papers concerns 4ft-quantifiers defined by applications of suitable thresholds to the measures of interestingness stud- ied in [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. We use notation for association rules used in section 2.1 in [3]. It means that we deal with the association rule A ? B instead of ? ? ?. Instead of the 4ft table of ? and ? in the data matrix M we use the enhanced 4ft table 4ft(A,B,M) of the Boolean attributes A and B in the data matrix M, see Tab. II. Here r = a + b is the number of rows satisfying A, s = c + d is the number of rows not satisfying A, similarly for k, l and B. Moreover n = a+ b+ c+ d is the number of rows of M.

TABLE II ENHANCED 4FT TABLE 4ft(A,B,M) OF A AND B IN M  M B ?B A a b r  ?A c d s k l n  We can suppose that each row of data matrix M corre- sponds to one market basket (i.e. tuple) and that columns of M correspond to particular items in the baskets. Each column is a Boolean attribute that is true in a row of data matrix M if and only if the item corresponding to the column is present in the basket corresponding to the row in question. In Tab. III there is an other notation [3] used for frequencies from the enhanced 4ft table 4ft(A,B,M) of A and B in M. We can see that a = n(AB), b = n(AB), r = n(A), k = n(B) etc.

TABLE III BASKET RULE FREQUENCIES FOR A? B M B B A n(AB) n(AB) n(A)  A n(AB) n(AB) n(A)  n(B) n(B) N  In definitions of interestingness measures are usually used frequencies (e.g. n(AB), n(A)) or probabilities and condi- tional probabilities [3]. An example of probability is P (A) = n(A) N , it denotes the probability of A. An example of con-  ditional probability is P (B|A) = n(AB)n(A) , it denotes the conditional probability of B, given A. Each interestingness measure I of the rule A ? B can be expressed also as the function I(a, b, c, d) of frequencies a, b, c, d from the enhanced 4ft-table 4ft(A,B,M) of A and B in M see Tab.

II.

Each 4ft-quantifier is defined by the condition concerning the 4ft-table. The 4ft-table is the quadruple ?a, b, c, d? of natural numbers see Tab. I or Tab. II. The conditions used in definitions of 4ft-quantifiers studied in [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15] can be composed from simple conditions of the form like I(a, b, c, d) ? T concerning functions I(a, b, c, d) of four natural numbers a, b, c, d. These functions can be of course understood as additional interestingness measures.

Moreover T is a suitable threshold. Note that some 4ft- quantifiers are defined by conditions like I ? T .

The 4ft-quantifier ?+p,Base (see Sect. II) can be defined using interestingness measures IAA and I defined such that IAA(a, b, c, d) = a(a+b+c+d)(a+b)(a+c) ? 1 and I (a, b, c, d) = a. The condition aa+b ? (1 + q) a+ca+b+c+d ? a ? Base associated to the AA-quantifier ?+q,Base can be written in the form IAA ? q ? I ? Base. The functions IAA(a, b, c, d) and I (a, b, c, d) are examples of additional interestingness measures.

The first question this paper tries to solve concerns relations of 4ft-quantifiers defined by applications of thresholds to known measures of interestingness and the results concerning logical calculi of association rules. These results are closely related to classes of association rules. Thus we have to study relations of 4ft-quantifiers defined by applications of  thresholds to known interestingness measures and classes of association rules described in Sect. III. These relations are summarized in Tab. IV.

There are described 27 particular measures of interesting- ness and corresponding 4ft-quantifiers in Tab. IV. Some of them were defined in several books and papers. There are used 17 known measures of interestingness from [3]. All of them except Laplace correction are defined by probabilities, see column Probabilities [3] in Tab. IV. Some of these 17 measures of interestingness are defined also in the books [9] and [19], it is noted in the column Name. Let us emphasize that the book [9] is from 1978 and [19] is from 1983.

Some measures of interestingness are defined under several names, it can be also seen in the column Name. Let us also note that some of these commonly known 17 measures of interestingness are defined or studied also in additional papers, e.g. in some of [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. The additional papers are cited only if they use different names of interestingness measures than used in [3]. There are also 10 interestingness measures defined only in [9], [19] or [6]. They are used to define important or interesting examples of 4ft-quantifiers belonging to various classes of 4ft quantifiers (i.e. classes of association rules).

There are two definitions of each measure of interestingness: (i) The definition by probabilities as given in [3], see column Probabilities [3] mentioned above. (ii) The definition as the function I(a, b, c, d), it is in the column I?(a, b, c, d). The function corresponding to the quantifier ? is denoted as I?(a, b, c, d). If the measure of interestingness is defined in [6] (rows 1, 25), in [9] (rows 2,3,8,9, 20?22), and in [19] (rows 14?19) then the function I?(a, b, c, d) is taken from the corresponding [6], [9], [19].

The 4ft-quantifiers corresponding to particular measures of interestingness are described in the columns Condition, Symbol, and Classes. In the column Condition there is the condition concerning the function I?(a, b, c, d), this condition defines the 4ft-quantifier. If the 4ft-quantifier is defined in [6], [9], [19], then the condition is taken from this literature, otherwise the condition is defined as ? Threshold. All con- ditions are written in the form ? Threshold, ? Threshold or < Threshold. It means that the whole condition is I?(a, b, c, d) ? Threshold etc.

Following thresholds are used: S ? (0; 1?, integer Base > 0, p ? (0; 1?, real q > 0, ? ? (0; 0.5?, real ? > 0, and ?2? is the (1 ? ?) quantile of the chi-square distribution function.

Note that the the Fisher?s quantifier ?? (see row 21 in Tab. IV) is in the book [9] defined by the condition ?min(r,k) i=a  (ki)(n?kr?i) (rn)  ? ? ? ad > bc. Here we omit the partial condition ad > bc because we are interested in the measure of interestingness I??(a, b, c, d) =  ?min(r,k) i=a  (ki)(n?kr?i) (rn)  . The  same is true for the ?2-quantifier, see row 22 in Tab. IV.

In the column Symbol there are symbols denoting the 4ft-  quantifiers. Each 4ft-quantifier has one or two parameters that are in the lower index of the corresponding symbol. Thus the 4ft-quantifier ?p of founded implication has the parameter p, etc. Newly defined 4ft-quantifiers are marked by *) in the column Symbol.

In the column Classes there is information concerning classes the quantifier belongs to. The following abbreviations are used for particular classes defined in Sect. III:  ? I for the class of implicational quantifiers ? ?E for the class of ?-equivalence quantifiers ? ?D for the class of ?-double implicational quantifiers ? E for the class of equivalence quantifiers ? F for the class of quantifiers with F-property ? ?F means that the quantifier does not belong to the class  of equivalence quantifiers Moreover, Ia,c, Id,b, Ir, and Ik denote newly defined classes, see Sect. VI-E and VII-B.

In this paper, we introduce two types of classes of 4ft- quantifiers ? the type of M-dependent classes see Sect. VI and the type of M-independent classes see Sect. VII. Infor- mally speaking, the definition of M-dependent class of 4ft- quantifiers uses the number of rows in particular data matrices and the definition of M-independent class of 4ft-quantifiers does not use the number of rows in particular data matrices.

Note that all classes of 4ft-quantifiers mentioned in section III are M-independent. The 4ft-quantifiers belonging to M- dependent classes are called M-dependent 4ft-quantifiers and the 4ft-quantifiers belonging to M-independent classes are called M-independent 4ft-quantifiers.

The facts about 4ft-quantifiers and classes are proved either in the literature given in the column Classes or in this paper.

The basic information is in notes 1) ? 9) given below.

1) The 4ft-quantifier ?S of support belongs to all M- dependent classes of 4ft-quantifiers, see Sect. VI.

2) The 4ft-quantifier ?B ? Base belongs to all M- independent classes of 4ft-quantifiers, see Sect. VII.

3) This is one of new implicational quantifiers, see Sect.

VII-A.

4) Belongs to the new class Ia,c of M-independent 4ft- quantifiers, see Sect. VII-B.

5) Belongs to the new class Id,b of M-independent 4ft- quantifiers, see Sect. VII-B.

6) Belongs to the M-dependent class Ir of 4ft-quantifiers, see Sect. VI-E.

7) Belongs to the M-dependent class Ik of 4ft-quantifiers, see Sect. VI-E.

8) This is one of new equivalence quantifiers with F property, see Sect. VII-C.

9) This is one of new quantifiers with F property that require additional research, see Sect. VII-D.

There are 17 4ft-quantifiers defined on the basis of known measures of interestingness taken from [3]. We can conclude the following from Tab. IV:  ? Two of them (see rows 3 and 20) are defined in [9] and the other two of them (see rows 14 and 17) are defined in [19].

? Four of them (see rows 4 ? 7) belong to the class of implicational quantifiers that contains three additional 4ft- quantifiers defined in [9]. Details are in Sect. VII.

? The 4ft-quantifier of accuracy (i.e. founded equivalence, see row 14) belongs to the class of ?-equivalence quan- tifiers that contains two additional 4ft-quantifiers defined in [19].

? The Jaccard 4ft-quantifier (i.e. founded double impli- cation, see row 17) belongs to the class of ?-double implicational quantifiers that contains two additional 4ft- quantifiers defined in [19].

? Three of them (see rows 20, 23, 24) belong to the class of equivalence quantifiers and have the F-property.

? Two of them (see rows 26, 27) have the F-property, they seem to be a bit similar to the AA-quantifier, see row 25.

They however require additional research.

? It means that 13 of 4ft-quantifiers corresponding to the measures of interestingness defined in [3] have properties given by the corresponding classes of association rules, see Sect. III.

? The 4ft-quantifier ?S of support (see row 1) inspires definition of M-independent classes, see Sect. VI.

? Four of 4ft-quantifiers corresponding to the measures of interestingness defined in [3] (see rows 10 ? 13) inspire definition of four new M-independent classes of 4ft- quantifiers, see Sect. VII.



VI. M-DEPENDENT CLASSES OF ASSOCIATION RULES A. Introduction to M-dependent Classes  We define several classes of M-dependent association rules in this section. Remember that classes of association rules are defined by classes of 4ft-quantifiers. The core reason for definition of new classes is the fact that the ?classical? association rule is not associational in the sense of definition given in [9]. Note that therefore we use the term equivalence 4ft-quantifiers instead of association 4ft-quantifiers, see end of Sect. III.

The ?classical? association rule A?p,S B with confidence p and support S is a composition of two association rules: the rule A?p B of founded implication with confidence p ( see row 3 in Tab. IV) and the rule A ?S B with the support S (see row 1 in Tab. IV). The problem is that the partial rule A?S B is not equivalence (i.e. not associational in the sense of [9]).

To prove it we have to find for each S ? (0; 1? two quadruples ?a, b, c, d?, ?a?, b?, c?, d?? of natural numbers such that a? ? a ? b? ? b ? c? ? c ? d? ? d, aa+b+c+d ? S, and a  ? a?+b?+c?+d? < S. It is easy to verify that this is satisfied  for ?a, b, c, d? = ?1, 0, 0, 0?, and ?a?, b?, c?, d?? = ?1, 0, 0, d?? where d? > 1?SS .

The problem is solved if we add an additional requirement a+b+c+d = a?+b?+c?+d? to the truth preservation condition.

Note that this can be seen as that we limit the original truth preservation condition a? ? a ? b? ? b ? c? ? c ? d? ? d such that it holds for ?a, b, c, d? and ?a?, b?, c?, d?? that concerns the same data matrix M, see also Tab. II. The classes of 4ft-rules defined by adding this condition will be called M-dependent classes.

However the question remains what about results presented in Sect. IV because of these results are based on the definitions of classes that are not M-dependent. The goal of this section is both to define several M-dependent classes of rules and to outline that similar results related to important deduction     TABLE IV MEASURES OF INTERESTINGNESS AND 4FT-QUANTIFIERS  Measure of interestingness 4ft-quantifier ? # Name Definition  I?(a, b, c, d) Probabilities [3] Condition Symbol Classes 1 Support [6] a  a+b+c+d P (AB) ?

New modified classes of 4ft-quantifiers are defined in Sect.

VI-B. We use predicate calculi of association rules to demon- strate deduction rules for association rules from new classes of rules. Definition of predicate calculi of association rules is informally outlined in Sect. VI-C, deduction rules for newly defined classes are studied in Sect. VI-D. Two additional M- dependent classes of association rules are in Sect. VI-E.

B. Important M-dependent Classes of Association Rules We define several M-dependent classes of 4-quantifiers (i.e.

classes of association rules): The 4ft quantifier ? is M-dependent equivalence if  ? (a, b, c, d) = 1 ? a? ? a ? b? ? b ? c? ? c ? d? ? d  implies ? (a?, b?, c?, d?) = 1 for all couples of 4ft-tables ?a, b, c, d?, ?a?, b?, c?, d?? such that a+b+c+d = a?+b?+c?+d?.

The 4ft quantifier ? is M-dependent implicational if ? (a, b, c, d) = 1 ? a? ? a ? b? ? b  implies ? (a?, b?, c?, d?) = 1 for all couples of 4ft-tables ?a, b, c, d?, ?a?, b?, c?, d?? such that a+b+c+d = a?+b?+c?+d?.

Note that the condition a? ? a?b? ? b is the truth preservation condition for implicational quantifiers TPC?; see section III.

The 4ft quantifier ? is M-dependent ?-double implica- tional if  ? (a, b, c, d) = 1 ? a? ? a ? b? + c? ? b+ c implies ? (a?, b?, c?, d?) = 1 for all couples of 4ft-tables ?a, b, c, d?, ?a?, b?, c?, d?? such that a+b+c+d = a?+b?+c?+d?.

The 4ft quantifier ? is M-dependent ?-equivalence if ? (a, b, c, d) = 1 ? a? + d? ? a+ d ? b? + c? ? b+ c  implies ? (a?, b?, c?, d?) = 1 for all couples of 4ft-tables ?a, b, c, d?, ?a?, b?, c?, d?? such that a+b+c+d = a?+b?+c?+d?.

We showed in Sect. VI-A that the ?classical? association rule A ?p,S B with confidence p and support S is not equivalence (i.e. not associational in the sense of [9]). The reason is in the fact that A ?p,S B is a composition of two association rules: the rule A ?p B of founded implication with confidence p and the rule A ?S B with the support S which is not equivalence. It is however easy to prove that both A?SB and A?p B are M-dependent equivalence. Thus the ?classical? association rule A ?p,S B is also M-dependent equivalence.

If the 4ft-quantifier ? is implicational then it is equivalence: Let ? (a, b, c, d) = 1 and a? ? a ? b? ? b ? c? ? c ? d? ? d.

We have to show that ? (a?, b?, c?, d?) = 1. We suppose that a? ? a ? b? ? b ? c? ? c ? d? ? d, it implies a? ? a ? b? ? b and thus ? (a?, b?, c?, d?) = 1 because of ? is implicational.

The 4ft-quantifier ?p,S is not equivalence thus it cannot be implicational. However it is easy to prove that it is M- dependent implicational. Thus the 4ft-quantifier ?p,S is an example of important 4ft-quantifier that is not implicational but only M-dependent implicational.

In [9] there is defined quantifier ?!p,?,Base as a composition of ?!p,? and ?Base and it is proved that ?!p,?,Base is implicational; similarly for ??p,?,Base. We can define the 4ft quantifiers ?!p,?,S and ??p,?,S as compositions of ?!p,? with ?S and ??p,? with ?S respectively. Using information given in rows 8 and 9 of Tab. IV it is also easy to prove that ?!p,?,S and ??p,?,S are examples of 4ft-quantifiers that are not implicational but only M-dependent implicational.

In [19] there is defined quantifier ?p,Base as a composition of ?p and ?Base and it is proved in [12] that ?p,Base is ?-double implicational. We can define new quantifier ?p,S as a composition of ?p and ?S . Again it is easy to prove that ?p,S is M-dependent ?-double implicational but not ?- double implicational. Note that both ?p,Base and ?p,S are derived from the Jaccard measure of interestingness, see row 17 of Tab. IV.

We can moreover define the 4ft quantifiers ?!p,?,S and ??p,?,S as compositions of ?!p,? with ?S and ??p,? with ?S respectively. Using information given in rows 18 and 19  of Tab. IV it is easy to prove that ?!p,?,S and ??p,?,S are additional examples of 4ft-quantifiers that are not ?-double implicational but only M-dependent ?-double implicational.

In [19] there is defined quantifier ?p,Base as a composition of ?p and ?Base and it is proved in [12] that ?p,Base is ?-equivalence. We can define new quantifier ?Mp,S as a composition of ?p and ?S . Again it is easy to prove that ?Mp,S is M-dependent ?-equivalence but not ?-equivalence.

Note that both ?p,Base and ?Mp,S are derived from the accuracy (or success rate) measure of interestingness, see row 14 of Tab.

IV.

We can define the 4ft quantifiers ?M !p,?,S and ?M?p,?,S as compositions of ?!p,? with ?S and ??p,? with ?S respectively.

Using information given in rows 15 and 16 of Tab. IV it is easy to prove that ?M !p,?,S and ?M?p,?,S are additional examples of 4ft- quantifiers that are not ?-equivalence but only M-dependent ?-equivalence.

Note that we have also shown that the quantifier ?S of support belongs to all defined M-dependent classes of 4ft- quantifiers; see also remark 1) in Sect. V.

C. Predicate Calculi of Association Rules  We use informally defined simple predicate calculi of asso- ciation rules (PCAR for short) to demonstrate deduction rules concerning association rules with 4ft-quantifiers belonging to M-dependent classes. Symbols of language of PCAR P are: (unary) predicates P1, . . . , PK , 4ft-quantifiers ?1, . . . ,?Q, logical connectives ?,?,? and additional usual symbol (e.g.

brackets). Each predicate corresponds to basic Boolean at- tribute see Sect. II, derived Boolean attributes are created from basic Boolean attributes. Boolean attribute is either basic Boolean attribute or derived Boolean attribute. Association rule is each expression of the form ? ? ? where ? and ? are Boolean attributes and ? is the 4ft-quantifier. There are no other formulas in P than association rules. If PCAR P has K predicates then we say that it is of the type ?K?.

Association rules (i.e. formulas of PCAR P) are interpreted in {0, 1} matrices that we call models of PCAR. If P is PCAR of the type ?K? then model of P is each {0, 1} data matrix M with columns f1, . . . , fK interpreting P1, . . . , PK respectively.

Rows of data matrix correspond to observed objects, we denote them o1, . . . , on. An example of such data matrix is in Fig.

2 where are also examples of derived Boolean attributes. The  Bool. attributes P1 P2 . . . PK ?P1 P2 ? Pn object f1 f2 . . . fK o1 1 1 . . . 1 0 1 ...

The value of ? ? ? in M is denoted as ||? ? ?||M, it is ||? ? ?||M =? (a, b, c, d) where ?a, b, c, d? = 4ft(?,?,M)     is the 4ft-table of ? and ? in M, see Sect. II. The association rule ? ? ? is true in M if it is ||? ? ?||M = 1, otherwise ? ? ? is false in M.

D. Deduction Rules and M-dependent Classes Results concerning deduction rules of the form ???????? where  ? ? ? and ?? ? ?? are association rules are briefly introduced in Sect. IV for classes of implicational, ?-double implicational, and ?-equivalence quantifiers. The goal of this section is to outline that similar results can be achieved also for M-dependent classes of association rules. We outline results namely for M-dependent implicational quantifiers, results for the additional classes will be only mentioned.

The results concerning the class of implicational quantifier are related to interesting implicational quantifiers defined in [12]: We say that the implicational quantifier ?? is inter- esting if ?? is both a-dependent and b-dependent and if ?? (0, 0) = 0. The 4ft-quantifier ? is a-dependent if there are a, a?, b, c, d such that ? (a, b, c, d) ?=? (a?, b, c, d). Similarly for the b-dependent 4ft-quantifier.

Remember that the 4ft-quantifier ? is implicational if ? (a, b, c, d) = 1, a? ? a and b? ? b implies that also ? (a?, b?, c, d) = 1. It means that each implicational quantifier is c-independent and d-independent (i.e. its value does not depend neither on c nor on d). Thus we write only ?? (a, b) instead of ?? (a, b, c, d) for the implicational quantifier ??, e.g. we use the condition ?? (0, 0) = 0 in the definition of interesting implicational quantifier.

The M-dependent implicational quantifiers could be c- dependent or d-dependent and this lead to the following defini- tion of interesting M-dependent implicational quantifiers: The M-dependent implicational quantifier ?? is interesting if it is both a-dependent and b-dependent and if ?? (0, 0, c, d) = 0 for each couple ?c, d? of natural numbers.

The presented results deal with the notion of associated propositional formula to a given Boolean attribute: If ? is an attribute then the associated propositional formula ?(?) is the same string of symbols but the particular basic Boolean attributes are understood as propositional variables. For ex- ample: P2 ? Pn is the derived Boolean attribute (see Fig. 2) and ?(P2 ? Pn) is the propositional formula P2 ? Pn with propositional variables P2 and Pn.

The criterion of correctness of the deduction rule ?? ??  ?????? for implicational quantifiers ?? is [12]: Let PCAR P be the calculus of association rules. In addition let ?, ?, ??, ?? be the Boolean attributes of P . If ?? is the interesting implicational quantifier then the deduction rule ??  ?? ?????? is correct if and  only if at least one of the conditions 1) or 2) are satisfied (we use the symbol ?? for the propositional connective of implication):  1) Both 1.a and 1.b are tautologies of propositional calculus  1.a: ?(? ? ?) ?? ?(?? ? ??) 1.b: ?(?? ? ???) ?? ?(? ? ??)  2) ?(?) ?? ?(??) is a tautology.

It seems that the analogous criterion for M-dependent  implicational quantifiers is not true, it can be however easy  proved the following theorem. (Note that this theorem says not ?is correct if and only if? but only ?is correct if?.)  Let PCAR P be the calculus of association rules and let ?, ?, ??, ?? be the Boolean attributes of P . If ?? is the interesting M-dependent implicational quantifier then the deduction rule ??  ?? ?????? is correct if at least one of the  conditions 1) or 2) are satisfied (again, ?? is the propositional connective of implication):  1) Both 1.a and 1.b are tautologies of propositional calculus  1.a: ?(? ? ?) ?? ?(?? ? ??) 1.b: ?(?? ? ???) ?? ?(? ? ??)  2) ?(?) ?? ?(??) is a tautology.

We outline the proof, we assume: M = ?M,f1, . . . , fK? is  the model of P , ??? ?, ?? ?? ?? are the association rules, ?a, b, c, d? = 4ft(?,?,M), ?a?, b?, c?, d?? = 4ft(??, ??,M) and thus it is a+ b+ c+ d = a? + b? + c? + d?.

We have to prove:  A) If the condition 1) is satisfied and ||? ?? ?||M = 1 then also ||?? ?? ??||M = 1  B) If the condition 2) is satisfied and ||? ?? ?||M = 1 then also ||?? ?? ??||M = 1  The proofs for particular points follow.

A): Let ||? ?? ?||M = 1, thus ?? (a, b, c, d) = 1. The  condition 1.a implies a? ? a, the condition 1.b implies b? ? b.

The 4ft-quantifier ?? is M-dependent implicational, we have ?? (a, b, c, d) = 1, a? ? a, b? ? b and a + b + c + d = a?+b?+c?+d?, it means ||?? ?? ??||M = 1, see the definition in Sect. VI-B. Thus the point A) is proved.

B): We assume ?? is the interesting M-dependent impli- cational quantifier. This means that ?? (0, b, c, d) = 0 for each b > 0. (The assumption ?? (0, b, c, d) = 1 for b > 0 implies ?? (0, 0, c + b, d) = 1 and this is in contradiction with ?? (0, 0, c, d) = 0 for each c, d.) We also assume that ?(?) ?? ?(??) is a tautology. This means for each M = ?M,f1, . . . , fK? that there is no object o ?M satisfying the Boolean attribute ??? and it implies a = 0. This however means that ||??? ?||M = 0 for each M. Thus it is true that if ||? ?? ?||M = 1 then also ||?? ?? ??||M = 1. This finishes the proof of point B).

It is easy to prove that the 4ft-quantifier ?p,S with con- fidence p and support S defining the ?classical? association rule A ?p,S B is the interesting M-dependent implica- tional quantifier for 0 < p < 1 and 0 < S < 1.

The singular cases when p = 1 or S = 1 we will not consider here. It is shown in Sect VI-B that ?p,S is M- dependent implicational. It remains to prove that ?p,S is both a-dependent and b-dependent and that ?? (0, 0, c, d) = 0 for each couple ?c, d? of natural numbers. Remember that ?p,S (a, b, c, d) = 1 iff aa+b ? p ? aa+b+c+d ? S. The proof that ?p,S is both a-dependent and b-dependent is based on the facts that lima?? aa+b = lima??  a a+b+c+d = 1 and that  limb?? aa+b = limb?? a  a+b+c+d = 0.

Note that the assumptions on a-dependency and b-  dependency are not used in the above given simple proof.

These assumptions are however used in the proof of the above mentioned ?is correct if and only if? theorem for implicational quantifiers given in [12]. It is supposed that these assumptions     will be also used in a proof of a following modification of ?is correct if and only if? theorem for the M-dependent implicational quantifiers:  Let PCAR P be the calculus of association rules and let ?, ?, ??, ?? be the Boolean attributes of P . If ?? is the interesting M-dependent implicational quantifier then the deduction rule ??  ?? ?????? is correct for ? and ? satisfying both  (I) and (II)  (I) ?(?? ? ?) is not a contradiction (II) ?(?? ? ??) is not a contradiction  if and only if at least one of the conditions 1) or 2) are satisfied  1) Both 1.a and 1.b are tautologies of propositional calculus  1.a: ?(? ? ?) ?? ?(?? ? ??) 1.b: ?(?? ? ???) ?? ?(? ? ??)  2) ?(?) ?? ?(??) is a tautology.

Let us emphasize that this ?is correct if and only if? theorem  is yet not proved but it is supposed that it can be proved in the same way as the analogous theorem for implicational quantifiers is proved in [12].

We have outlined a way how the results for implicational quantifiers can be modified to get results for M-dependent implicational quantifiers. We can get the similar results for M-dependent ?-double implicational quantifiers and for M- dependent ?-equivalence quantifiers by modifications of re- sults mentioned in Sect. IV and presented in [12]. The more detailed description of these modifications is however out of the scope of this paper.

E. Additional M-dependent Classes of Association Rules We can derive new M-dependent classes of rules on the  basis of the measures coverage and prevalence, see rows 12 and 13 in Tab. IV. The coverage measure of interestingness is defined as a+ba+b+c+d =  r n It leads to a new M-dependent  class Ir defined by the truth preservation condition TPCIr : a? + b? ? a+ b ? a? + b? + c? + d? = a+ b+ c+ d. It is easy to prove that the 4ft-quantifier ?Cp belongs to this class.

Similarly we can define an additional new M-dependent class Ik defined by the truth preservation condition TPCIk : a? + c? ? a+ c ? a? + b? + c? + d? = a+ b+ c+ d. It is easy to prove that the 4ft-quantifier ?Pp of prevalence belongs to this class.

For additional M-dependent classes see also Sect. VII-B.



VII. M-INDEPENDENT CLASSES OF ASSOCIATION RULES Several M-dependent classes of association rules are de-  fined and studied in the section VI. They are inspired by the ?classical? association rule A ?p,S B with confidence p and support S and several interesting 4ft-quantifiers are also in- spired this way. The M-dependent classes of association rules are defined such that the condition a+b+c+d = a?+b?+c?+d?  preserving the number of rows in the analyzed data matrix is added to the true preservation condition of classes defined in section III.

The classes defined in section III without this condition are thus called M-independent classes of association rules.

Some of 4ft-quantifiers defined from known measures of  interestingness belong to particular M-independent classes and some of these 4ft-quantifiers inspire definition of new interesting M-independent classes. Summary of these facts is given at the end of Sect. V. Some more information follow.

Let us mention that it is easy to prove that the quantifier ?B ? Base (i.e. absolute support) belongs to all M-independent classes of 4ft-quantifiers mentioned here.

A. New Implicational Quantifiers  There are new 4ft-quantifiers defined in the rows 4?7 of Tab. IV. We prove that all of them are implicational. We have to prove that if ?? is any of these quantifiers and if ?? (a, b, c, d) = 1 and a? ? a ? b? ? b then also ?? (a?, b?, c?, d?) = 1; see Sect. III.

The 4ft-quantifier ?Lp of Laplace correction is defined such that ?Lp (a, b, c, d) = 1 if I?Lp (a, b, c, d) ? p and ?Lp (a, b, c, d) = 0 otherwise where I?Lp = a+1a+b+2 ; see row 4 in Tab. IV. It means that it is sufficient to prove that if a? ? a ? b? ? b then it is I?Lp (a?, b?, c, d) ? I?Lp (a, b, c, d).

The proof is simple, if it is a? ? a ? b? ? b then: a?+1  a?+b?+2 ? a+1a+b?+2 ? a+1a+b+2 . The proofs for the additional quantifiers from rows 5?7 are similar.

B. New M-independent Classes We can derive new classes of rules analogous to the class  of implicational rules defined by truth preservation condition TPC?: a? ? a ? b? ? b, see Sect III. The TPC? concerns the frequencies a, b that play role in the definition of P (B|A), see row 3 in Tab. IV. We can define analogous classes of rules inspired by the definitions of 4ft-quantifiers based on P (A|B) and P (?B|?A), see rows 10 and 11 in Tab. IV.

The conditional probability P (A|B) leads to the definition of the class of Ia,c?quantifiers defined by the truth preservation condition TPC?a,c that is: a? ? a ? c? ? c. The 4ft-quantifier ?Rp of recall defined by the condition aa+c ? p (see row 10) is an example of a 4ft-quantifier belonging to the class of Ia,c-quantifiers.

The conditional probability P (?B|?A) leads to the def- inition of the class of Ib,d?quantifiers defined by the truth preservation condition TPC?b,d that is: b? ? b ? d? ? d.

The 4ft-quantifier ?Sp of specificity defined by the condition b b+d ? p (see row 11) is an example of a 4ft-quantifier belonging to the class of Ib,d-quantifiers.

We can expect that the classes Ia,c and Ib,d will have similar properties like the class I of implicational quantifiers. Note that we can also define new classes of M-dependent rules by adding the condition a+ b+ c+ d = a? + b? + c? + d? to the truth preservation conditions TPC?a,c and TPC?b,d . More detailed investigation of all these classes is out of the scope of this paper.

C. New Equivalence Quantifiers with F-property  First we prove that the Yule?s Q 4ft-quantifier ?Qp (see row 23 of Tab. IV) is equivalence. We have to prove that if a? ? a ? b? ? b ? c? ? c ? d? ? d and ?Qp (a, b, c, d) = 1 then also ?Qp (a?, b?, c?, d?) = 1 To do it, we prove that     I?Qp (a?, b?, c?, d?) ? I?Qp (a, b, c, d). We use the simple fact that u  ??v? u?+v? ? u?vu+v if u? ? u ? 0 and v ? v? ? 0. We  suppose that a? ? a ? b? ? b ? c? ? c ? d? ? d and it means that a?d? ? ad and b?c? ? bc. Thus a?d??b?c?a?d?+b?c? ? ad?bcad+bc and it finishes the proof.

Now we prove that the Yule?s Q 4ft-quantifier ?Qp has the F-property. We have to prove that (i) if ?Qp (a, b, c, d) = 1 and b ? c? 1 ? 0 then ?Qp (a, b+ 1, c? 1, d) = 1 and (ii) if ?Qp (a, b, c, d) = 1 and c ? b? 1 ? 0 then ?Qp (a, b? 1, c+ 1, d) = 1. To prove (i), we prove that I?Qp (a, b+1, c?1, d) ?I?Qp (a, b, c, d) for b ? c? 1 ? 0. It but follows from the fact concerning u  ??v? u?+v? ? u?vu+v used above, we have u? = u = ad  and v? = (b + 1)(c ? 1) and v = bc, it is v ? v? because of b ? c? 1 ? 0. It finishes the proof of (i). The proof of (ii) is similar.

The proof that the Yule?s Y 4ft-quantifier ?Yp (see row 24 of Tab. IV) is equivalence and has the F-property is similar.

D. New Quantifiers with F-property  The proof that the 4ft-quantifier ?L+q of Lift (see row 26 of Tab. IV) has the F-property can be done by sim- ple algebraic operations and we skip it. We show that for q > 1 the 4ft-quantifier ?L+q is not equivalence.

We find quadruples ?a, b, c, d? and ?a?, b?, c?, d?? such that a? ? a ? b? ? b ? c? ? c ? d? ? d, a(a+b+c+d)(a+b)(a+c) ? q > 1 and a?(a?+b?+c?+d?) (a?+b?)(a?+c?) < q. We use ?a, b, c, d? = ?1, 0, 0, d? where d ? q and ?a?, b?, c?, d?? = ?a?, 0, 0, d? where 1 < 1 + da? < q.

It is easy to verify that they have required properties. It seems that the 4ft-quantifier ?L+q is for q ? 1 equivalence, the proof requires however some symbolic computation.

The 4ft-quantifier ?I+q of information gain (see row 27 of Tab. IV) has similar properties.



VIII. CONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER WORK  We introduced logical calculi of association rules together with 4ft-quantifiers and known classes of 4ft-quantifiers and of association rules. We argued for their usefulness, we em- phasized deduction rules between association rules; see Sect.



IV. We defined new 4ft-quantifiers by applications of suitable thresholds to several known measures of interest. We proved that some of new 4ft-quantifiers belong to known classes of rules with important properties. We also shown that new interesting classes of rules can be defined on the basis of the other new 4ft-quantifiers and we proved some interesting results concerning new classes. Due to limited space of the paper the results are presented only very briefly.

Moreover there are various open questions concerning re- lation of the measures of interestingness of association rules and logical calculi of association rules. Some of them are listed below, they are subject of current research.

? What are the relations of additional tens of interestingness measures defined and studied e.g. in [1], [2], [3], [4], [5] to known classes of association rules?

? Are there some additional new classes of association rules with interesting properties?

? Are there some unknown useful deduction rules concern- ing known or new classes of rules?

? What are the relations of properties of interestingness measures (see e.g. Table V in [3]) to classes of association rules?

? What about definability of association rules correspond- ing to yet not studied interestingness measures in classical predicate calculus with equality, see [15]?
