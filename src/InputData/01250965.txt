T-Trees, Vertical Partitioning and Distributed Association Rule Mining

Abstract  In this paper we consider a technique (DATA-VP) for distributed (and parallel) Association Rule Mining that makes use of a vertical partitioning technique to distribute the input data amongst processors. The proposed vertical partitioning is facilitated by a novel compressed set enu- meration tree data structure (the T-tree), and an associated mining algorithm (Apriori-T), that allows for computation- ally effective distributed/parallel ARM when compared with existing approaches.

1 Introduction  An approach to distributed/parallel Association Rule Mining (ARM), DATA-VP, that makes use of a vertical par- titioning approach to distributing the input data is described.

Using this approach each partition can be mined in isolation while at the same time taking into account the possibility of the existence of large itemsets dispersed across two or more partitions. To facilitate the partitioning a compressed set enumeration tree data structure (the T-tree), developed by the authors, is used together with an associated ARM algorithm ? Apriori-T. The approach described offers sig- nificant advantages with respect to computational efficiency when compared to alternative mechanisms for (a) dividing the input data between processors and/or (b) achieving dis- tributed/parallel ARM.

2 The T-tree and the Apriori-T algorithm  A significant consideration, with respect to ARM, is the nature of the data structures used to store itemsets as the algorithm progresses. The authors have developed a num- ber of compressed set enumeration tree structures to support ARM including the T-tree (Total Support Tree) [7, 6], and a number of serial ARM algorithms to be used in association with these structures. Of particular relevance, with respect to this paper, is the Apriori-T algorithm.
