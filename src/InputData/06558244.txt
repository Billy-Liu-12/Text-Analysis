A Comprehensive Survey Of Association Rules

Abstract?The discovery of association rules is one of the very  important tasks in data mining. Association rules help in the  generation of more general and qualitative knowledge which in turn  helps in decision making. Association rules deal with transactions of  both binary values and quantitative data.[9] The traditional  algorithms for mining association rules are built on binary attributes  databases, which has two limitations. Firstly, it can not concern  quantitative attributes; secondly, it treats each item with the same  significance although different item may have different  significance[6]. Also binary association rules suffers from sharp  boundary problems[18]. Moreover many real world transactions  consist of quantitative attributes. That is why several researchers  have been working on generation of association rules for quantitative  data. This paper presents different algorithms given by various  researches to generate association rules among quantitative data. We  have done comparative analysis of different algorithms for  association rules based on  various  parameters.

Association Rules are used to  identify the dependencies and correlation among attributes in  the database. These rules have proven to be very useful in the  field of marketing and retail as well as many other diverse  fields. Generally an association rule is described by the form  X Y where X and Y are two different sets of items [6] [10].

To measure the strength of these rules two factors namely  support and confidence are used, which determine  significance and certainty of a rule respectively [3][10].

Association Rules are one of the widely used methods for  discovering valuable patterns in data mining. It is one of the  very important data mining tasks because more general and  better quality knowledge may be discovered which helps in  better decision making. The procedure of association rule  mining consists of two steps. In the initial step, it finds the  itemsets that occurs frequently and in the next step, it creates  association rules for those items. Association Rule mining  finds interesting association relationships or correlations  among a large data set of items [26]. It has been recognized  that the conventional algorithms for mining association rules  can only mine those datasets that have binary attributes. It  cannot deal with the datasets that have categorical or  quantitative attributes. Quantitative attributes should be  properly dealt in the same manner as the Boolean attributes in  the field of data mining[5][6]. Earlier approaches for  quantitative association rule mining uses sharp partitioning for  converting other attributes to binary ones which suffers from a  major problem which results in information loss because of  sharp ranges[13][27]. In other words existing algorithms  ignore or overemphasize items near the boundary.  To  overcome this problem researchers are working for mining  association rules for quantitative attributes. They have  provided various algorithms that treat quantitative algorithm  and shows how they deal with quantitative data.

The aim of this paper is to present a comparative survey of  different association rules on quantitative data proposed by  various researchers.The layout of the paper is as follows:  Section 2 different types of association rules along with the  uses.. In section 3 we provides an overview of the existing  work that has been done by researchers in the area of  association rules In section 4 we provided a comparative study  in a tabular form. Finally, In section 5 we have drawn a  conclusion for our study.

2. STATE OF ART  In data mining, association rule learning is a popular and  well researched method for discovering interesting  relations between variables in large databases. It is  intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases  using different measures of interestingness.

Association rules can be categorized in the following two  categories:  A: DIRECT AND INDIRECT ASSOCIATION RULES  Direct Association Rule: Those association rules that deal  with only frequently occurring data itemsets.

Indirect Association Rule: Those association rules that deal  with both frequently and infrequently occurring data  itemsets. These rules help in getting insight view of data  and dealing with a new kind of knowledge discovery  problems.

B: POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE ASSOCIATION RULES  Positive Association Rule: This rule tells that a record  having a certain linguistic term will also have another  linguistic term associated with it.

Negative Association Rule: This rule tells that a record  having a certain linguistic term will not have another  linguistic term associated with it.Some of the uses of using  Association rules can be entitled as below:  Proceedings of 2013 IEEE Conference on Information and Communication Technologies (ICT 2013)     ? Association rules do not represent any sort of causality or correlation between the two itemsets.

? X  Y does not mean X causes Y, so no Causality  -  X  Y  can be different from Y  X, unlike  correlation  ? Association rules assist in marketing, targeted advertising, floor planning, inventory control,  churning management, homeland security.

? AR can be automatically generated.

? AR represents patterns in the data without a specified  target variable.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE SCOPE    In this paper we have presented an analysis of different  association rules being proposed by various authors to deal  with quantitative data. We have examined association rules on  various parameters and provided a comparative study in a  tabular manner. In the end we conclude that the direct  application of association rule on the data might produce huge  number of redundant rules, therefore domain knowledge,  characteristics of data, and the objective of the application to  be developed should be considered while doing mining  process. In the future work, we propose a framework of  association rules for data warehouse that overcome the above  problems observed by various authors.
