Intelligent Avionics with Advanced Clustering. John Meier

Abstract?In this paper, we consider tracking targets using  multiple distributed sensor platforms. Rather than sending the  tracks to a central location, such as a command and control  center where information is exchanged between platforms,  we consider a distributed solution. While fixed position sin-  gle sensor tracking of a single target is considered straightfor-  ward, multiple sensors on the different platforms with over-  lapping coverage is complex because duplicate tracking data  is generated for the same targets. Redundant information gen-  erates network messages that in turn overload the network  performance, and may result in traffic congestion on limited  avionic bandwidth wireless links that prevents time critical  data from reaching its destination. In our approach, we iden-  tify similar tracking data to be distributed and send only one  copy of the message.

In order to identify redundant data, we use a clustering al-  gorithm to evaluate the large volumes of sensor information.

Distributed multiple target tracking (MTT) combines track  observations from different sensors to identify the same tar-  get. Massive computation and communication is required for  distributed real time MTT. In this paper, the K-means cluster-  ing algorithm is used to aggregate redundant tracks. Software  simulations using Matlab and emulation tests using Emulab  show significant improvement of the information quality by  using clustering. An MTT system was prototyped with FPGA  hardware to cluster high volumes of data with low latency in  real time at the network layer.
