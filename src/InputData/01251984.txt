To effectively guide the trafiic flow, its status must be analyzed and  predicted in real-time. This paper presents an  analytical and prediction model for urban region trafiic flow status, which uses several data  mining technologies. With the predicting class neural network, the decision tree constraints set, the association rules constraints set, and the correcting class neural network in the model, we take into consideration the influences on future trafiic flow of all factors. not only the traffic flow itself, but  also its static and the dynamic indices. Thus it has a great improvement in prediction accuracy.

Indes Terms-Analytical and  prediction model, Data collectin: attributes, Data mining, Traffic flow status  1. INTRODUCTION In the modem society, automobiles play an important role in our daily life. With the rapid expansion of urban regions, however. urban traffic gives rise to many problems. Since the 1990s. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have shown obvious advantaps in solving urban traffic problems[l.l; I I]. One of the major challenges to ITS is to otTer route guidance to vehicular traffic so as to reduce trip time esperienced[9]. This paper proposes a model for predicting urban region traffic tlow using data mining techniques that have found many applications in disparate fields.

Recentlyl some researchers partly used methods related to data mining to predict real-time traffic status to improve current prediction rvays[lO]. Some prediction models have dso  been developed. But most of the models haxje weakness in combination. evaluation. and seiection optimization of prediction methods, which lead the low accuracy, scalability and adaptability. We developed a new prediction model, which combines several salable data minine methods, such as decision tree, association rules: and neural networks.

11. DATA MINING TECHNIQUES Data mining originated from machine learning and knowledge disco\,ery. and has become one of the hottest research areas in recent years. It is cross-discipline in nature.

and uses knowledge and techniques from areas such as database systems. anificiai intelligence. statistical learning, parailel processing. and visualization. It applies techniques like neural networks, rule generation and deduction.

regression analysis. genetic algorithms. etc. to analyzing data and extracting knowledge in different ways. Data mining Is referred IO as Expiorbl,o Aiia!vsis2 meaning it explores !he hidden relationship and rules beneath a dara set.

I t s  results are often beyond one?s expectation. Data mininz is of great value to researchers and enterprise managers.

Two kinds of data mining analytical methods. Classifiers and Associations, are used to construct our prediction model far urban region traffic tlow. In what follo\vs we present a brief introduction to the three algorithms used in the methods: BP (Back Propagation) Neural Network. Decision Trees, and Association Rules.

.A. BP .Vetira/ A?envork BP Neural Network is a back propagtion multi-layer perceprron[j]. Generally speaking, it consists of an input layer. m output layer and several hidden layers. Each layer  Fig. 1. Structure ofa neuron     is made up of certain amount of artificial neurons. Two ad.jacent layers are connected with links, each with an associated weight. Figure 1 shows the general structure of an artificial neuron.

There are a number of variations on the output functionf: Two commonly used functions are the threshold function,  y = f ( x ) = s g n ( z w , x ,  -8), IS,  where 0 is the threshold, and the sigmoid function,  y =  f ( X )  = -- I :  > ??( - l : l ) .

I +e-?  For a multi-layer artificial neural network_ the outputs of the neurons in the first layer become the inputs of the next layer, and so on. The weights in the network are initially assigned random values; as the network is trained with the input samples, errors are propagated backwards and the weights are corrected iteratively, hence the term for this ?ype of networks, ?Back Propagation?.

BP Neural Network is widely used for prediction with a time series data set. It can also be trained as a classifier to conduct ciassification analyses.

values On&. That is, S=S, US2U -US,. Here, At is called a Classification Attribute, and vi ( i  =l-c) is called a Classification. Figure 2 shows a decision bee based on the traffic data collected from an intersection. Among the attributes such as Service Level, Time and Split (the ratio of Effective Green ?lime to the Cycle Length), Service Level is selected as the classification attribute, which contains three classifications: good, normal, and poor.

Decision trees can be used in classification prediction. Put a data record with unknown classification w the root of the decision tree. Let it move down along the path ofmeasuring attributes level by level. When it reaches a leaf node, the maximum classification of the leaf would be the classification prediction of the unknown data. Moreover, every path that originates from the root to a leaf gives rise to a classification rule. A set of such mles makes a decision table, which is also a frequently-used method in prediction.

C, Associo~ion Rules Association Rules analysis[3, 41 aims at discovering the hidden relationship within a data set. Frequently occurring patterns and unusual patterns are identified by iteratively scanning the data set, with the results cast into a number of rules that take a form such as ? X =. I? ? or ?If X Then Y?.

More formally, let I = 11, In ..., I.  be the set of several nominal attributes. Each attribute is called an Item. A data record in the data set can be represented by an n-dimensional vectOr, This Yeclor,  B. Decision Trees Decision trees are the most popular model in classification analysis, for the mined results can be conveniently visualized with a tree structure, providing the user with knowledge that is easy to undentand[7J. Some well-known decision tree algorithms include C4.5, CART and CHAID[12,6, 81.

7 = I?,, ,..., v,, ,... Y,? I , (I  5 5 E I ,  ?,, E vaiue$l,, )) , is made up of values of several Items in I .  It is called an Itemset. Here m is the size ofthis itemset. If certain Itemset T comes in existence on a data record, we say the record Formally, let S be the data set. There is an attribute (or  can be split into c non-overlapping subsets according to the feature) Ax in S that can take c values from VI  10 v,. Then S T, Let ,,, be the number of records in the  (goodo26.1.,b-l normal (136137.8%  I poor (130)36 1% llatal 360  good: (0) 0% normal: (IO) 10.9% poor: (82) 89.1%  normal: (12)40.0% n o d :  (26) 25.5%  Fig. 2. Example 01 a decision tlce     data set, and Count(l7 denote the number of records that satisfy itemset T.

Then if X and Y &e two itemsets, and there are no common items in them, we could write down an association rule with the Confidence and Support constraints in this form  x =) y IC+$ .

Here confidence is defined as E =  measures the accuracy of a rule, and support is defined as  s = C o u n ~ x U Y ) .  which describes the frequency of the  ?1 , which Counr(X)  N ruIe[131.

Ill. DATA ATTRIBUTES AND COLLECTION Data mining is based on a sufficiently large amount of data.

Therefore, a data set constructed on a set of attributes, also called indices, is needed. This analysis is on the traffic flow status in an urban Rgion composed of road segments and intersections. Data was mainly collected from the collecting points located in the intersections. Two types of indices are used, listed as follows 12; 151: 4 Static indices  3 Parking Conditions 9 Phase Plan  4 Dynamic Indices These indices have numeric values that change with time:  > Volume by Movement ( v h ) > Percent Heavy Vehicles (%) 9 Ratio of Parking 9 Operating Speed (hh > Peak Hour Factor 3 Cycle Length (s) 3 Green l i m e  (s) 3 Split  The information about the static indices can be acquired from the government?s traffic administration department, whereas the dynamic indices can be measured with the help of electronic devices (e.g. vehicle detectors, etc). A dynamic index is usually measured in a time interval. ranging from 5 minutes to 30 minutes; a shorter interval is selected if it is in peak hours or in a period in which traffic varies with time frequently.

Besides intersections, lo which the above indices apply, other types of mad segments also need to be considered.

They include interchanges. roundabouts, tunnels, etc. Both types of indices in the above can still be applied here, so long as the intersection-specific attributes are not used.

These indices have values that are fixed or relatively stable in B period of time: IV. BUILDING THE PREDICTION MODEL  Z AreaType 3 Number ofLanes .4.

A map from thc six classes Level of S e n k  to numbers I to 6 can he huilt \?er\. easily, therehy preserving the sequence information of the traffic flou status: and making ii more convenient for the model to process.

After the prediction index is determined, thc traffic flow status prediction model of a single collecting point in the region can be constructed. I n  essence: this model is a compound BP neural network with decision trees constraints and association rules constraints, as shown in F i p r e  ?. I t  not only predicts the trafic flow status in the next period through dynamic indices. but also takes into account the relationships between dynamic and static indices, and sequential panems in the data of the whole region, which is to amend the prediction results. So compared with the pdi t ional  neural network prediction model, our model is more reasonable and accurate.

E. Predictin,. C/ass M u o r k The predicting class neural network focuses on the real-time prediction of the Level of Senice. which is very important to the whole model. Its input is the Level of Service in time period I _  obtained from the real-time volumes collected at the collecting point. And it  outputs the prediction of the Level of Senice in period [ + I ,  which is S,, +,,, One thing worth mentioning is that the incoming  Level of Service is related not only to the current Level of Service directly, but also to the collecting points all around to a $reat estent. So it seems not very reliable to get a prediction from data coming from only this point. A common solution is to feed the real-time data collected from the point to predict and i t s  neighboring points that are directly connected, into the input layer. For regions in which network connections are relatively complex or the collecting points are close to each other, data from those  .4\.erage Slopped Delav(s/i.)  <=lo  1 7  -20  indirectly connected points can also be fed into the input layer.

The structure and the corresponding parameters of the prediction class neural network need to be determined in advance. Some historical data are needed to train the network. Through the error feedback mechanism, the weights of all links between the neurons become reasonable.

As the network converges and becomes stable, its structure can be saved and used to predict dynamic changes of the Level of Service. For the correctness of the prediction, the training data set must contain a large amount of data; typically it should span at least I to 3 months, to make it statistically significant.

C. Decision Trees C&.rrrainls Se1 The prediction class network only predicts the Level of Senice from the Level of Sensice itself, and takes no consideration about the influence from those static indices.

For instance, in cenain periods of time, changes in parking conditions and bus operation can affect the Le\,el of Sewice near the collecting point. To analyze this type of influences, decision trees are used.

First select several sets of  static indices. Multiple traininp data sets are thus constructed hy combining the data of a set of static indices in period f (for the static attributes wlues can still change in some situations) and the Level of Service in period [ + I .  Each training set generates a decision tree TA which takes the Level of Service as the classification attribute to examine the influences from different combinations of static indices. Then these decision trees are saved into a set DTsef = I?; Ti ;-/, which is called a Decision Trees Constraints Set.

. The mechanism of the decision trees constraints set can be described as follows. In eveiy data collection period, the time period information and the static indices data are imported to decision tree constraints seL Each.decision tree could generate a Level o f  Service prediction of next period because of the prediction ability of the trees. Then these predictions are compared with the result of prediction class network and convened to correctors lo the network prediction. Formally, a corrector is defined as  v?,AJ = w , , ( f n  - P x ) ,  where Pn is the prediction from the i-th decision tree, and PN is the prediction from the prediction class network. w,, is the weight tied to the i-th decision tree.

All w , ? s  are initiated equally, that is, a11 decision trees have the same correcting influence to network prediction. Once the real Level of Sen,ice in next period is collected, all w, would be adjusted gradually by the error feedback from the correcting class network. The more accurate a corrector is, the more the corresponding w, will increase. Decreasing can also take place. Once the weight of cenain decision tree continues to decrease and falls below certain threshold, the  ? ?     tree will be removed from the decision tree constraints set, for it has only negative effect on correcting prediction. The constraints set is thus a dynamic set. Trees of higher quality remain, and lower quality ones are washed out. New members will be generated periodically to keep dynamic update.

D. Associalion Rules Consmints Set The idea and hnction of an association rules consmints set is similar lo a decision tree constraints set. They differ in that the association rules constraints set takes into account the influences from dynamic indices at the collecting point and its neighbors, rather than those from the static indices, as the decision trees do. One example is that, when the data of all collecting points around a main street that links a city to its suburb shows that the number of heavy vehicle increases, the percentage of heavy vehicles on this main street will also increase and the Level of Service of this street will be affected. So a data set can be constructed by combining the dynamic indices data of the current collecting point and its neighbors in period 1, with the Level of Service data of the current collecting point in period t+I, thereby generating association rules from historical data.

If the association rules are expected to conshain the Level of S e n k e ,  then it needs to make certain constraints in rules generation. In other words, it is to find out every association rule Ri with the form X a S,(,,,, IC,, , which satisfies c = Count(SUS, ,.,,) >= c m" . and s = COund.YUS,,.,,) >= shn.

This avoids the generation of those useless rules and saves computing resources by setting conditions while generating candidate itemsets in the association rule algorithm[?, 41.

Those generated rules form the association rules constraints set ARsef = (-; R; ;-/. It is a dynamically updated rules table in essence. And its function in constraining is similar to the decision trees constraints set.

E. Correcfing Class Nenvork The use of the correcting class neural network is to compare the corrected Level of Service S,' (,+,, with the real Level of Service S, ' collected from the next c?cle.- By propagating errors it adjusts the weight Wn of the raw prediction result from the predicting class network. the weight W, of the correction from the decision trees constraints set, and the weight W, of the correction from the association rules constraints set. These weights represent the degree of their intluence on the final prediction result.

There is a Structural uncerlainty in prediction of neural networks, that is. many trials of their structures and parameters need to be done before the best network appears.

Factors like the size and distribution of the training set and the way networks are trained will influence the correctness of the predicting class network. If the predictins class network is well trained. then S,' will be greatly dependent on S, and W, and W, will turn to be very  CO""f(S) 5  Level of Service  small in this situation. But if there is quite some difference between S , , ,  and S,r,+,,, W, and W,w i l l  be increased. The target of placing the correcting class network is to compensate the falling accuracy in case of a terriblytrained predicting class network.

F.

The prediction ability of this model at a collecting point depends on the way the training historical data is constructed. If the prediction of the Level of Service after n periods is needed, a training data set that consists of the static and dynamic indices value, the Level of Service in period t and the Level of Service in period t+n should be joined together. Thus the trained model could reveal the variation of the Level of Service with an n-periods interval.

If predictions of variant intervals are needed, there is a need to train and save multiple models.

The collected data of all collecting points in the region should be saved to a central data warehouse. AI1 components of the prediction model are in general updated through historical data with a fixed time interval. say one month. The model thus represents the up-to-date tratiic flow panem all the time. Besides the periodic update, the model should be updated. or even reconsuucted, once t h e  arc events like road construction and maintenance. etc. in the legion.

V. APPLICATION OFTHE MODEL The analytical and prediction model presented in the previous sections was applied to solving a real world problem. Data of indices mentioned in section 3 \yere collected fmm the main intersections of a certain metropolitan area in Shanghai. 90?6 of the data were used as historical data to train the model- and the model took the remainins lO?6 s unseen set to predict their states oftraific tlow and the Level ofSrrvice in the next period.

In this application. the association rules constmints set was used to analyze the dynamic indices of one intersection and its neighboring ones. Then the decision trees constraints set was used to take into account the inkluences of the static indices. The above two steps could be regarded as a kind of data pre-processing. When the processing was finished. the data was then imported to the two-phase-neural networks for training.

VI. SUMMARY With the help of several data mining techniques. this paper proposes an analytical and prediction model for urban region traffic flow status, which is based on collected dynamic and static indices data. Compared with the traditional models, a more global consideration is taken, not only about the traffc flow itself in the region, but also about the influences of static and dynamic indices on future traffic flow status. It is implemented through integrating the predicting class network, the decision trees constraints set, and the association rules constraints set into the model. Also a correcting class network is set up to correct prediction errors. It is belie\)ed that this model can be used in dynamic traflic prediction for urban traffc flow guidance.
