Abstract?Dual energy CT (DECT) has become a hot topic  among security inspection recently for its high detection precision and robust material identification ability. Currently, in one typical realization of DECT, two sets of detectors are needed.

However, the high cost of the system become a big limitation for its wide usage. Moreover, in some particular situation, the detective objects detected in security inspection with regular shapes and  thicknesses don?t need complete sampling to reconstruct. Therefore, a new idea of system setup, dual energy CT with reduced data system (DECT-RDS), only a few detector bins instead of complete-sample bins of the second high energy set which can greatly reduced the cost, had been created. And then, we proposed a new dual energy CT reconstruction method with reduced data (DECT-RD) requiring much fewer data to reduce the cost of detectors. In this paper, to fully investigate the feasibility of its application in security inspection, we are developing such an experimental imaging system (DECT-RDS).

Practical experiments are done by using only 20% detector bins instead of complete-sample bins in each projection. Results give a relative error less than 5% between complete sampling and undersampling. The results demonstrated that detector bins can be greatly reduced in dual energy CT imaging, hence much lower the system cost. We believe this type of system configuration will drive DERT into wide practical applications.

I. INTRODUCTION n recent years, because of its high detection precision and robust material identification ability [1], [2], [3], [4], DECT  has played a significant role in security inspection [5].

Currently, in one typical realization of DECT, two sets of detectors are needed: one receives low energy photons, and the other receives high energy photons?, as shown in Fig. 1.

However, the high cost of the detectors becomes one of the key problems for this kind of DECT imaging system. Furthermore, in some particular situation, the detective objects detected in security inspection with regular shapes and  thicknesses don?t   This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of  China under the project No. 60871084, No. 60772051 and No. 10575059, and the Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University No.

Only a few detector bins instead of complete-sample bins of the second high energy set, the system cost can be greatly reduced. To fully investigate the feasibility of its application in security inspection, we are developing such an experimental imaging system (DECT-RDS) in our lab. An advanced image reconstruction method with reduced data [6] is utilized in DECT-RDS reconstruction. The system has advantages of high precision and low cost. This paper focuses on the feasibility study of its application to security inspection.

Through some preliminary experiments, our method and system are validated to be effective for security inspection.

II. SYSTEM DESIGN Why we choose the configuration of Fig. 1 to investigate? As  we know, there are three kinds of DECT configurations for circular trajectories. The first one, like the Fig. 1, is with a single energy source and a two sets of detectors (one receives low energy photons, and the other receives high energy photons) rotating during a scan. The second is with a high-low energy switched source and one set detectors which can receive high and low energy photons synchronously rotating during a scan and the last kind is with one pair of high energy source and one set of high energy detectors, and one pair of low energy source and one set of low energy detectors respectively rotating once.

The first kind of configuration imaging has the capability of examining objects online fast and its source is not complicated.

Therefore, an experimental DECT system with first kind of configuration imaging is currently being developed in our lab, as shown in Fig. 4, to validate the feasibility of applying DECT-RDS to security inspections.

The parameters of the system are given in TABLE I and the high-low energy spectrum of the experiment system are shown in Fig. 5.

III. IMAGE RECONSTRUCTION STRATEGY We proposed DECT-RD reconstruction method requiring  much fewer data to reduce the cost of detectors [6]. The method uses low energy complete sampling projections to reconstruct CT image and using segmentation method puts the reconstruction with regular shapes and  thicknesses into a new image with different regions by gray-value difference and marked them with different numbers. With these prior knowledges and dual energy undersampled data, the path length ( )jl i  of dual energy ray i through region j, as shown in Fig. 2, can be acquired. Then, it is combined with dual energy undersampled projection data to acquire the integral value of dual effect coefficients A by looking up the full elements H-L curve table [7], as shown in Fig. 6. Finally, by using pre-reconstruction dual effect decomposition method for dual energy imaging with ( )jl i  and A, linear equations [8] are set up to obtain the atomic numbers (Z) of the scanned objects. Fig. 7 is the process of the DECT-RD.

IV. EXPERIMENTS We validate our method DECT-RD and demonstrate the  performance of DECT-RDS configuration through the results on the experiments system.

Suppose the amount of the full detectors is N, and we only use N/5 high energy detectors mounted averagely every 5 detectors instead of complete-sample bins of the second high energy set, as shown in Fig. 8. That means, N/5 high-low energy undersampled projection data are selected to reconstruct.

In the meanwhile, we set up a phantom, as shown in Fig. 9.

Four small (Al, PMMA, PVC and Graphite) spheres are symmetrically mounted in the detective area. Filtered backprojection algorithm (FBP) [9] is used to acquire a low energy CT reconstruction.

Finally, based on the real experimental data obtained by the DECT-RDS, we get the reconstruction by the DECT-RD method and compare with the reconstruction by the DECT complete sampling method in TABLE II.

Therefore, it can be seen that reconstructions in a DECT-RDS can be a good approximation to the ideal one.

Meanwhile, the detector bins can be greatly reduced in dual energy CT imaging, hence much lower the system cost.



V. CONCLUSION We investigated the feasibility of applying the DECT-RD  and DECT-RDS configuration for security inspections in this paper. Through the preliminary experimental results, our system and method were validated to be effective. However, only some simple phantoms and situations had been studied.

More work will be done to improve and further validate this system, such as more complicated phantoms will be attempted       and more reasonable  location of high-low energy detectors will be investigated, and etc.
