I.  INTRODUCTION Good trend of development change which along with the  information technology development and the medicine, causes the hospital no longer is pauses regarding the database request in the general data processing stratification plane, but is gradually to the data deep analytic hierarchy and the use direction transformation. But the only present hospital establishes the hospital information system (his system) the database analysis inquiry function as well as various departments own professional ability, It is unable to discover or to withdraw the knowledge and the rule which his system in the magnanimous data contains[1]. But also is at the start stage to the hospital medical service system domain aspect, passes through many year movements, not only in the existing service database contains patient's expense information, moreover contained the massive patient basic information, clinical has gone see a doctor, the pathology information and the correlation phantom picture information and so on. Uses the association rule data mining technology in the hospital HIS system analysis to produce the patient to go see a doctor the situation ruleset.As a result of his database application complexity, withdraws the useful information, goes see a doctor the treatment to hospital doctor, aspects and so on medical management level decision-making should have certain guiding sense or say obtains certain experience, makes certain beneficial attempt for this use associated data excavation technology in the hospital HIS analysis application[2].

Based on this research, withdraws in his system in recent years each kind of information which is association with the patient, establishes by the patient information analysis primarily database, and using the association rule data mining technology, to these service data extract, the data clean, the data conversion, the data load and so on a series of data preparation process has carried on certain elaboration,  and the incidence relation carries on the analysis and the research take the patient disease and during other symptoms as the example. Has established many kinds of analysis dimension for example: As well as the patient disease association information table, department dimension, doctor dimension, age of gender dimension, address dimension, and correlation dimension, etc.



II. ASSOCIATION RULE MINING RELATED KNOWLEDGE AND TECHNOLOGY  The association rule (Association Rules) mining domain research important topic also is of most active research techniques [3]. The initial motive is aims at the shopping basket analysis the question to propose, its goal is seeks in the transaction database the different item of collection (commodity) between existence each kind of relations and the association, namely relation rule. Obviously is association the rule to be possible to obtain the corresponding application in some domains. Concrete, May through patient's common characteristic which seeks trouble some kind of disease through the database, then for cures this kind of disease to provide certain help or the superintendent to this kind of patient to the corresponding department, the correlation medical personnel analyzes, treats this kind of disease and the complication provides the valuable reference.

A. Definition of association rules.

The association rule DM is between the discovery mass  data mean terms collection the interesting association or the correlation relation [4]. The definition of association rule description is as follows: let  be the set of all items. Supposes data  },,,{ 21 miiiI ?? D  is the data business storehouse  business set, in which each business  is an item of collection set ( ).Each business has only business identifier TID. Supposes  T IT ?  A item of collection business t contains item of collection A , also when only .The association rule is the shape like  logical concealment, in , , and  TA ? YX ?  IX ? IY ? ??YX ? .

B. Association rule mining algorithms.

Had many scholars, the researcher to the present  association rule excavation question has conducted certain research. Studies through the analysis and is association the summary, according to the processing data mode difference,   DOI 10.1109/IHMSC.2013.206    DOI 10.1109/IHMSC.2013.206       the existing each kind of association rule excavation algorithm mainly divides into the search algorithm, Apriori algorithm (width first algorithm), algorithms and so on depth first algorithm, level algorithm, data set division algorithm, sampling algorithm, complex association rule algorithm[5].

So the association rule mining is divided into two sub- processes:  1) Frequent item sets discovery.

After calculating the minimum support of each item set,  frequency itemsets meeting the user specified minimum support are selected. Its mining algorithms discover all item associations (or rule) in the data that satisfy the user- specified minimum support (mins up) and minimum confidence (minconf) constraints. The procedure of creating association rules is matching rules that meet the support and confidence in Large FrequentItemset[6].

Data preprocessing  His data  Data extraction  Associat ion rule  Apriori  Association rule knowledge  base  user Clementine12.0 result  2) Produce all association rules based on frequent item sets and minimum confidence threshold.

The preceding process duty highly effective discovers the D  completely frequent item set rapidly, is association the rule excavation the crucial question, is weighs the association rule excavation algorithm efficiency the target; The latter process has the strong rule enumeration investigation process by the frequent item set.

Then we mine the set and get all frequent class association rules that satisfy the minimum confidence and support.



III. KNOWLEDGE RESEARCH OF HIS ASSOCIATION RULES DATA MINING  A. The analysis process of association rules mining 1) The core of the model with the structure of the  association rule mining method. This model structure may divide is three: First is the data level, second processes the level, third is the object-oriented user level. The data level is responsible for the data the memory; the processing level is responsible to apply association rule Apriori algorithm good data mining [7]. Took to the hospital HIS data integrity excavation process may the simple summary be: First extracts the data from the hospital HIS database (data preparation), to the data after the data pretreatment (revision, elimination) sends in the sample database, then utilizes the association rule Apriori algorithm correspondence in the sample database to assign out the sample data, establishes the initialization correspondence the algorithm model, and will store in the knowledge library with this model related data which will correspond, will finally present using association rule software Clementine12.0 by the result form for the user.

After has established the application model, should carry on the confirmation to the model effect, carries on the monitoring as necessary. Because the hospital patient medical record, the condition information is developing the change unceasingly, after very possible period of time, changes unceasingly along with the correlation data, therefore along with the model period of revolution increase,  wants to do unceasingly to the model result tests, sometimes needs to establish this model.

Figure 1. HIS architecture model of association rule mining  2) Steps of association rules mining. May see by the model in view of his data mining and general data mining existence certain difference, but his connection rule data mining still followed the general data mining the knowledge discovery process.

a) Data Understanding, the data understanding is association the rule data mining an important process, understood the corresponding medicine domain knowledge, carries on the full understanding after the hospital HIS data can carry on the data mining the work, and can determine his data mining the goal and the conclusion appraisal standard. Therefore the data understood the process is needs to understand, familiar information data and so on patient medical record, disease, can the medical service understand transforms for to the data the understanding, and thus has the pointed development data mining[8].

b) Whether the data preparation (data collection and pretreatment) decides his connection rule data mining conclusion correct crucial step. Redundancy has which according to HIS data oneself, it is necessary to carry on the examination to the relevant data. The data preparation stage mainly is the patient is hospitalized the data, the outpatient service goes see a doctor the data and the patient applies drugs the prescription data the collection preparatory work.

Cannot be  in hospital or the outpatient service all includes the massive correlation data?s, in which patient diagnoses the expense which the information, the patient natural attribute, the medication information as well as produce and so on, in which some is the information which has nothing to do with the excavation duty[9]. The data preparation stage is must collect and reorganize and disease symptom correlation patient data, like the medical record (prescription number) ID, sickness name, the seeing a doctor time, the diagnosis situation, the medication situation,       go see a doctor the administrative offices and so on.

According to his associated data excavation need, may choose the hospital administrative offices information table, in hospital medical record information table, outpatient service drugs tables and so on prescription table, patient information table, is association through the table same field them.

c) Data correction. Revisions as data cleaning, selection, processing, and transform the data; As a result of the ihs data has diversity, converts the raw data to a data association rules mining method required data form. You need to eliminate it,for there may be redundant or irrelevant data. Association rule is used to find out the meaningful relationship between a given data set items, the need for the whole process of analysis, found the fallback. Such as the patients age, sex, disease conditions can be carried out quantitative association rules, such as according to medical experts' knowledge, Age can be divided into I1 [0, 20], I2 [21,30], I3 [31,45], I2 [46,60], I5 [older than 61] .Using new data transformation methods, and set a new parameter values.

d) Determine the association rules algorithm. Data mining algorithms perform this is ihs data is another key step in the process of knowledge discovery. This step including the selection of mining technology, the model establishment and evaluation of association rules, etc. And depends largely on the accuracy of the data mining excavation method and research target matching degree.

Data mining is geared to the needs of users, so we need to find the association rules model visualization, or need to convert the results for the user to understand. using data mining, combine his elements judge order methods, mining the association rules which based APRIORI algorithm[10].

B. Implementation of HIS association rules of data mining 1) Solve the problem of association rules data mining.

To the existing HIS system analysis, the connection rule data mining may solve the main problem which or can solve:  a) Different disease pathogenesis factor incidence relation;  b) According to different diseases, the rate of insured and uninsured in patients on different parameters of medical quality is compared. in view of different disease, cure time, cure rate as well as expense incidence relation situation;  c) The different disease patient attribute distributes according to the area and goes to see a doctor the administrative offices incidence relation situation;  d) Identical disease outpatient, in-patient along with time interval change and medication change incidence relation;  e) Identical disease, different doctor's expense distribution incidence relation;  f) In view of hospital service income situation forecast and hospital drugs sale situation forecast and so on.

2) Mining association rules in HIS data.

a) Disease, symptom information table set up. First to  his data in patient's disease, the symptom data carries on certain processing, establishes disease, the symptom comparative table, to establish the patient possible symptom a pair of code.

b) The patients association rule database is established. Scans the patient in his data to go see a doctor the information, according to disease, symptom of comparative table the symptom information table, for becomes the patient symptom information data conversion can carry on connection rule processing the information code, diagnoses disease result information code with the patient to unify, finally forms a patient to receive a medical examination the information data sheet.

c) Found that frequent item sets. First patients receives a medical examination using Table 2 the information data sheet, is association the rule Apriori algorithm to carry on processing, has the item of collection 1 data acquisition table 3, the smallest support will suppose will be 40%, the smallest confidence will suppose is 45%, will obtain the high connection degree. In which through the smallest support which establishes 10% has S1, S2, A1, A2 and so on item of collection table 2, may do these items for the foundation, but does not consider other item of collections.

TABLE I. ITEMSET 1 DATA SET  Itemset Support (%) S1 67 S2 67 S3 33 S4 33 S5 33 S6 33 ? ?  TABLE II. ITEMSET 2 DATA SET  Itemset Support (%) S1 S2 67 S1 A1 67 S1 A2 33 S2 A1 33  ? ? S5 A3 0  ? ?  TABLE III. ITEMSET 3 DATA SET  Itemset Support (%) S1 S2 A1 67  S1 S2 A2 33 S1 S2 A3 33  ? ?        d)  The establishment of the association rules. Uses the frequent item of collection 3, as a result of {S1, S2, A1} the support is the 67%, S1 support is 67%, may calculate S1?S2, A1 the confidence is 50%, conforms to the smallest confidence requirement, therefore the connection rule is tenable. May establish like A1?S1, S2 the confidence according to the above principle is 100% connection rule table. If thus it can be seen take representative S1 on the abdomen ache, the S2 expression as full, A1 is time the chronic gastritis, S1?S2, A1 this connection rule meaning for when the patient has on the abdomen ache symptom, indicated has 50% above possibility to follow has the full phenomenon production, because but these symptom occurrence, the main reason has the possibility is the chronic gastritis causes. When in the real life, the patient to the hospital sees a doctor to doctor, generally can on own initiative describe the oneself body ill place, but physician-in-charge acts according to patient's description, can inquire generally some other possibly occur symptom, but doctor the reason that wants to inquire patient other possibly occur the symptom, mainly is rests on its specialized knowledge training as well as many years practices medicine the accumulation experience. But doctor diagnoses to the patient also has general idea time, to patient some symptoms completely had not understood or the understanding is insufficient, young doctor lacks the initiative in particular, when not initiative inquiry, has unexpected result which the possibility occurs: Because possible the condition error diagnostic to cause the patient to receive much suffers, but also has the possibility to create the medical trouble both sides medical dispute.

The Mining association rule theory is used in a concrete HIS System, it realized the composition of the HIS System and data mining. This also helps to reduce the amount of spelling errors which can occur. When the symptoms the patients describe input to the computer, the system can search out its symptoms corresponding code words, and according to the code, and get the corresponding association rules, according to the prompt of the system and we can remind the doctor the patient may at the same time, there are other concurrent symptoms, but these symptoms may be caused due to some disease. And generally occurred in the body discomfort to the hospital, often because of don't know what kind of specialized subject doctor to turn to, normally only according to their own subjective consciousness to registered mail. But the reality is often the patient after visits may be told what kind of college. It not only waste of the patient's money, but also may cause a waste of medical resources. Can, therefore, the hospital in the medical service desk or registered chamber system with association rules table search functions, provide relevant personnel can according to the patient's symptoms, and suggested that it might have got what disease, and put forward what should hang families, to find what kind of doctor for medical treatment, etc.



IV. SUMMARY The association rule mining is the non-surveillance data  mining, also is one of data mining patterns which simple easy to operate, it may help the policy-maker to discover non-ordinary, but latent valuable information and knowledge, first therefore should become the modern hospital HIS system data warehouse establishment and the data mining system construction profitable target carries out. This article utilizes the association rule to apply in his system, is trying carries on the association rule excavation to between disease and the correlation factor, should say, along with conducts the experimental exploration research to in hospital HIS data many kinds of attributes, and with the correlation scientific researcher and the medical worker (doctor, superintendent) carries on certain cooperation. Can display the association rule to excavate itself characteristic and the superiority or said the data mining technology will achieve the better display function.
