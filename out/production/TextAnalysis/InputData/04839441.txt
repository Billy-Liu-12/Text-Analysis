Abstract?Environmental pollution is coeval with the appearance of humans. Water pollution problem becomes increasingly critical in this present-day, whether in developed or developing countries. Sediment is the primary cause of water pollution. The environmental pollution problem can be measured using ground instruments such as turbidity meters for water measurements. Field measurements cannot provide fine spatial resolution maps with detailed distribution pattern over a large study area.

The study was carried out to verify the validity of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Multi-Channel Sea Surface Temperature (SST) (NOAA MCSST) algorithm by NOAA at South China Sea. SST is verified by comparing the SST calculated by algorithm with sea-truth data collected by Research on the Sea and Islands of Malaysia (ROSES). ROSES had travelled and collected data at South China Sea from 26 Jun 2004 to 1 August 2004. In this study the transmittance function for each band was modeled using the MODTRAN code and radiosonde data.
