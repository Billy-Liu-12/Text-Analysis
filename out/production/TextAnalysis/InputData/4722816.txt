A Mining Algorithm For Email?s Relationships Based  On Neural Networks

Abstract?The analysis of the vast storehouse of email content accumulated or produced by individual users has received relatively little attention other than for specific tasks such as relationship. Current email analysis in standard client applications consists of keyword based matching techniques for relationship of email files. We have implemented a tool, called the Email Mining Set (EMS) for analyzing email archives which includes a graphical display to explore relationships between users and groups of email users. Our design goal is to embed the technology into standard email clients, such as foxmail and Outlook, revealing far more information about a user?s relationship is otherwise now possible.

I.  INTRODUCTION Computer forensic technology has already become a focus  attention of the law and computer science area since this year.

With status of the research and development of computer forensic technology, there are two problems of consummating Legal norm in computer forensic technology and process.

Frequency using email has already become an important communication way among members of crime organizing. The amounts of research about relations among people using email for communication testify human relations at a certain extent.

Dividing the relation by the research of the email information between users attracts more and more researchers? attention.

Meanwhile, the data amount is so much that deficiency in Database analyses the method. The large amount of email resource gaining through various channels is always no rule. It is difficult to discover the interrelation and information clue from known data, and it has no way to forecast the future development trend and analysis deathly[1,2,3].

Data Mining means that extract out the unknown, valuable pattern from large amount of data, and it is widely be used among the field of industrial control, business management, and science research, etc. there are much arithmetic for data mining, include: Fuzzy Set, Rough Set, Neural Network, etc.

The relation about Huge Data and Integrated Data are very  complicated in reality, high Nonlinearity, noise data existence, so it may restrict to apply some feasible algorithmic.

Data mining means fetching unknown and valuable model from huge data set. An association rule is a rule which implies certain association relationships among a set of objects in a database. Since finding interesting association rules in databases may disclose some useful patterns for decision support, selective marketing, financial forecast, medical diagnosis, and many other applications, it has attracted a lot of attention in recent data mining research. Mining association rules may require scanning of large transaction or relational databases which is quite costly in processing. Therefore, efficient mining of association rules in transaction and/or relational databases has been studied substantially.

The development of distributed algorithms for efficient mining of association rules has its unique importance, based on the following reasoning. Databases of data warehouses may store a huge amount of data. Mining association rules in such database may require substantial processing power, and distributed system is a possible solution. Many large databases are distributed in nature. This High flexibility, scalability, low cost performance ratio, and easy connectivity of a distributed system make it an ideal platform for mining association rules [4].

The paper has told a data mining system carrying out relation specifically for the email date. According to the concept leading into email address similar and active among clustering process, it reaches the effect carrying out clustering mail address having the similarity characteristic, providing a kind of new analysis method to the information processing email. Then, the computer forensic software function focuses on disc analysis; other work is dependent to be done by experts by hand, carrying to mislead the computer forensic software implement similar to disc analysis software. With the development of computer theory and the technology about crime forensic, it will be improved. From the researcher in the field, we can discover that not only the forensic technology is basal principle for analysis computer document and the data, but also it can mine crime information among data system   DOI 10.1109/CSSE.2008.1537     information. Judging from the view of technology, data mining should be an effective technology for computer forensic technology. It is a hot spot in theory and applying for the current research computer science and technology, but many problems will be developed and improved. The paper tells how to use data mining technology to apply to computer crime forensic technology, and give a thought about fundamental data mining, through actual case analysis process to build an effective computer forensic method and way[4,5].



II. THE DATA MINING?S FOUNDATION OF EMAIL- RELATIONSHIP  A. The Translation Rule and Format of Email There is a special way in sending email that the information  is not sent to the destination directly, but transferred by several mail servers in a ?storage-transfer? way. As shown in Fig. 1, ordinarily, an email is sent from the user, transferred to the SMTP server by mail client program, and then transferred by several mail servers, to the mail servers of recipients by pop3 server program with accounts and password.

The email format is defined by RFC822, sime-structure text file, including header and context. And the header has key information, such as FROM, SENDER, REPLY TO, TO, CC, BCC, MESSAGE-ID, DATE, RECEIVED, RESENT, SUBJECT, and COMMENTS. A common email?s header is shown as Figure 2.

B. Ways Based on Data Mining Data Mining is a useful information and knowledge process  that fetches from the large, incomplete, noisy, vague and random data. Computer Forensics Data Mining  is  the  concept     Figure 1. The transfer-flow of email.

of process with unascertained the discovery of crime information, analysis and production based-computer (and the related system).Therefore, the way of Computer Forensics Data Mining is to establish the classification of the form of property crime, extraction the rules and the pattern found. Because a great deal, not complete, noise, vague and random data, in most cases it does not have a condition for data analysis, despite doing much in-depth research of mining model and algorithms in theory, but the results is still on ideals and formal. It can not achieve the purpose of data mining if only rely on incomplete data analysis, and statistical data being built in the way of experience and intuition based on a combination of data mining is a very useful way. According to data analysis having the generalized features, we call the generally data mining, combination information mining[3].



III. TECHNIQUES FOR EMAIL-RELATIONSHIP MINING There is an important relationship between large itemsets  and the sites in a distributed database: every globally large itemsets must be locally large at some sites. If an itemset A is both globally large and locally large at a Si, A is called gl-large at site Si. The set of gl-large itemsets at a site will form a basis for the site to generate its own candidate sets. Two monotonic properties can be easily observed from the local large and lg- large itemsets.

In order to study email flows between groups of users, we can compute a set of cliques based on the data present in an email archive. We seek to identify clusters or groups of related email accounts that participate with each other in common email communications. Conceptually, two broad types of cliques can be extracted from user email archives: user cliques and enclave cliques. In simple terms, user cliques can be inferred by looking at the email history of only a single user account, while enclave cliques are social groups that emerge as a result of analyzing traffic flows among a group of user accounts within an organization. The algorithm initially counts the number of emails exchanged between any two given users, regardless of the direction of the traffic flow. This absolute number is compared to a threshold. If the count is above the threshold, then the link between the two underlying accounts is established and a graph begins to form. This is computed over all emails and all email accounts appearing in all messages, whether sender or receiver of an email. At this point, we have a list of cliques of size 2, called dyads.

Features that made email so popular are the rapidity of communication, the minimum cost and the fact that it is remarkably easy to use. An advantage over Email communication is that it is asynchronous, meaning that there is no need for both sides of communication to be on-line or in front of a computer at the same time.

A decision tree is a structure similar to a flow chart. In order to classify an unknown sample, the attribute values of the sample are tested against the decision tree. A path is traced from the root to the leaf node that holds the class prediction for that sample. D Decision trees have been used in many application areas ranging from medicine to game theory and business. The basic algorithm used in decision tree induction is a greedy algorithm that constructs the trees in a top-down,     recursive, divide and conquer manner. The algorithm is a version of ID3, a well-known decision tree induction algorithm. The information gain measure is used to select the test attribute at each node in the tree. Such a measure is referred to an attribute selection measure or a measure of the goodness of split. For example, let S be a set consisting of s data samples. Suppose the class label attribute has m distinct values defining m distinct classes, Ci (for i=1, . . .,m). Let si be the number of samples of S in class Ci. The expected information needed to classify a given sample is given by  ? =  ?= m  i iim ppsssI  221 )(log),...,,(                              (1)  where pi is the probability that an arbitrary sample belongs to class Ci and is estimated by si/s. Let attribute A have v distinct values, {a1,a2, . . .,av}. Attribute A can be used to partition S into v subsets, {S1,S2, . . .,Sv}, where Sj contains those samples in S that have value aj of A. Let sij be the number of samples of class Ci in a subset Sj. The entropy, or expected information based on the partitioning into subsets by A, is given by  ),....,( ...

The smaller the entropy value is, the greater the purity of the subset partitions. For a given subset Sj,  ? =  ?= m  i ijijmjjj ppsssI  221 )(log),...,,(                       (3)  where i  ij ij s  s p =  and is the probability that a sample in Sj  belongs to class Ci.The encoding information that would be gained by branching on A is  )(),...,,()( 21 AEsssIAGain m ?=                             (4)  The algorithm computes the information gain of each attribute and the attribute with the highest information gain is chosen as the test attribute for the given set S. As a node is created and labeled with the attribute, branches are created for each value of the attribute, and the samples are partitioned accordingly.

Figure 3, which is called the User Panel, demonstrates the relationship between senders and their receivers. The blue nodes aligned as the left most column of the display are the (indexed) membership. The black nodes are the Email sender.

Each distinct black node corresponds to one distinct email address. They are placed in different columns depending upon the number of membership they belong to. For example, a sender who  belongs  to  only  one  membership  is  in  the  first   Figure 3. Visualization of membership.

column immediately adjacent to the blue colored membership nodes. A sender who is part of two memberships is in the second column, and so forth. The senders aligned at the right- most column are those who are members of the most membership, and may be regarded as very significant well connected individuals in an organization.

The edges in this graph represent the relationship of clique members. If there are two cliques with some common member, EMS displays a link between the two cliques. We use different colors to represent the percentage of users that the two cliques share, indicating how similar the cliques are to each other. The color mapping is shown in Table 1. For example, cliques A and  TABLE I. THE DEGREE OF SHARING USERS  Color Percentage  Orange <10%  Yellow > 10%, <= 20%  Red > 20%, <= 30%  Cyan > 30%, <= 40%  Blue > 40%, <= 50%  Magenta > 50%, <= 60%  Green > 60%, <= 70%  Gray > 70%, <= 80%  Pink > 80%, <=90%  Black > 90%     clique B share 30% of users, and hence they are linked with a red edge. When the user clicks on an edge, the common users appearing in both cliques is displayed.

In the SDK package, we can get the relationship from email?s information, such as FROM, SENDER, REPLY TO, TO, CC, and BCC fields. The Figure 4 is given by the independent email system.

IV. CONCLUSION Many email archives are currently being preserved with the  intention that they will be a valuable resource in the future.

Governments preserve some email archives as public records, businesses may keep their emails to comply with certain laws, and some individuals save their personal email as a record of their life. In order for historians and social scientists to make use of these archives, they need powerful tools to navigate through a vast number of messages. In this paper, we present a new technique to allow email archive explorers the ability to identify discussions. By presenting visualizations that go beyond the threads of email, explorers can become aware of messages that would have otherwise been hidden. Our legible visualizations present relevant temporal and social data that provides explorers with an enhanced opportunity to understand discussions evidenced in email archives.
