Approach of Image Denoising Based on  Discrete Multi-wavelet Transform

Abstract? A new approach by using discrete multi-wavelet transform to remote sensing image denoising is presented. The wavelet theories have given rise to the wavelet thresholding method, for extracting a signal from noisy data. Multi-wavelets can offer simultaneous orthogonality, symmetry and short support, and these properties make multi-wavelets more suitable for various image processing applications, especially denoising.

Denoising of images via thresholding of the multiwavelet coefficients result from pre-processing and the multi-wavelet transform can be carried out by treating the output in this paper.

Multiwavelet transform technique has a big advantage over the other techniques that it less distorts spectral characteristics of the image denoising. The form of the threshold is carefully formulated and is the key to the excellent results obtained in the extensive numerical simulations of image denoising. The experimental results show that multi-wavelet on image denoising schemes outperform wavelet-based method both in subjectively and objectively.

I.     INTRODUCTION Wavelets as a cascade of multi-rate filter banks provide a  multi-resolution decomposition. Discrete-time FIR filters lead to continuous-time basis functions. Such wavelet decompositions are especially effective for transform-based image denoising because of their correspondence with models of human visual perception. The method of signal denoising via wavelet thresholding was popularized by Donoho and Johostone [1], and is now widely applied in science and engineering. It is based on thresholding of wavelet coefficients arising from the standard scalar orthogonal discrete wavelet transform (DWT). Wavelets are a useful tool for image processing applications such as image compression and denoising. Image denoising systems work best with symmetric filters, which eliminate artificiality due to image boundaries.

However, nontrivial symmetric two band orthogonal wavelets do not exist.

Until recently, multi-wavelets, which are extension from  scalar wavelets, have received considerable attention from the wavelets research communities both in theory as well as in applications such as signal compression and denoising [2].

Recently this approach has been extended to incorporate thresholding coefficients arising from the discrete multiwavelet transform (DMWT). Multi-wavelets have several advantages in comparison with scalar wavelets on image processing, such features as short support, orthogonality, symmetry, and vanishing moments, which are known to be important in image processing. A scalar wavelet cannot possess all these properties at the same time. On the other hand, a multi-wavelet system can simultaneously provide perfect reconstruction while preserving length (orthogonality), good performance at the boundaries (via linear-phase symmetry), and a high order of approximation (vanishing moments). Thus multi-wavelets offer the possibility of superior performance for image processing applications, compared with the scalar wavelets, and the experiments show that multi-wavelets have the potential to outperform scalar ones [3].

In this paper we research wavelet thresholding in the context of scalar orthogonal and multiple orthogonal wavelet transforms. In section 2, the multiwavelet transform, especially CL multi-wavelet, is introduced. A new image denoising algorithm based on multi-wavelet is proposed in section 3 of this paper. In section 4, a group of experiments are presented, and the results of the experiment are discussed based on subjective and objective criteria. Finally, this section summarizes the paper, and we get the conclusions.



II.     DISCRETE MULTIWAVELET TRANSFORM Multiwavelets have attracted much attention due to their  nice properties. They are very similar to wavelets but have some important differences. Wavelets have an associated scaling function )t(?  and wavelet function )t(? , but multiwavelets have two or more scaling and wavelet functions.

For notational convenience, the set of scaling function can be written using the vector notion  T r21 ])t(...)t()t([)t( ???=? , where )t(? is called This work was supported by the Project on Science Research Program of  the Hubei Provincial Department of Education in China (D20081507)     the multiscaling function. Likewise, the multiwavelet function is defined from the set of wavelet functions as  T r21 ])t(...)t()t([)t( ???=? , where r >1 is an  integer. When r=1, )t(? is called a scalar wavelet, or simply wavelet [4]. The multiwavelet two-scale equations resemble those for scalar wavelets:  ? ?= ?  =  1m  0k )kt2()t( ?? kG                                           (1)  ? ?= ?  =  1m  0k )kt2()t( ?? kH                                         (2)  The pair { }kk HG ,  is called a multiwavelet filter bank (this is often abbreviated multifilter bank). kG  is called a matrix lowpass filter and kH  is called a matrix highpass filter. They are rr ?  matrices for each integer k, and m is the number of scaling coefficients [4,5]. The matrix elements in these filters provide more degrees of freedom than a scalar wavelet.

Another very important multiwavelet system was Chui-Lian (CL), constructed by Chui and Lian. It has been constructed by imposing conditions on the two-scale coefficients concerning symmetry, orthonormality and a fixed order of approximation.

The dilation and translation equations for this system are as follows,  )2t2(G)1t2(G)t2(G)t( 210  1 ?+?+=?? ?  ?? ?= ???? ? ?  (3)  ? ? ?  ?  ?  ? ? ?  ?  ?  = ?  ?      0G , ? ? ?  ?  ?  ? ? ?  ?  ? =    G ,  ? ? ?  ?  ?  ? ? ?  ?  ?  = ??      2G ;  )2t2(H)1t2(H)t2(H)t( 210  1 ?+?+=?? ?  ?? ?= ???? ? ?

It has 2 scaling functions and 2 wavelet functions (r=2). Figure 1 shows the CL multiwavelet.

The CL multiwavelet has the highest possible approximation order (=2) for its filter length, and it belongs to a class of multifilters which scaling and wavelet functions are symmetric/antisymmetric pairs. Translates of the scaling functions and wavelets are orthogonal. Both scaling functions are short support, supported on [0, 2]. Their remarkable properties show that multiwavelet has more useful features than scalar wavelets.

The application of multiwavelets requires that the input signal to be first vectorized, namely preprocessing (which is a crucial point known as multiwavelet initialization or prefiltering) in multiwavelet. Prefilters generate multiple (vector) input streams from a given scalar source stream, and form the initial expansion coefficients of a given multiwavelet system. We have chosen the prefiltering strategy based on the  22?  Haar filter matrix, which has the advantages of simplicity, orthogonality, short support and symmetry.

Naturally, after we reconstruct an image by multiwavelet coefficients, a post-processing has been down by postfilters.

The post-processing is an inverse processing of initialization by means of post-filtering techniques.

As in the scalar wavelet case, the theory of multiwavelet is based on the idea of multiresolution analysis (MRA). During a single level of decomposition using a scalar wavelet transform, the 2-D image data is replaced with four blocks corresponding to the subbands representing either lowpass or highpass filtering in both dimensions. The 2-D reconstruction of an image is obtained by simply performing all the steps described above for decomposition in the reverse order. The final step is post-processing. It is an inverse processing of initialization by means of post-filtering techniques. After the post-processing, a vector image can be reverted a scalar image.



III.   IMAGE DENOISING ALGORITHM Generally speaking, image denoise processing can be  summarized as follows. Let X is the clean image and Y is the image which adds with white noise W, namely Y=X+W. The noise W has mean zero and variance 2? . The algorithm to denoise with multiwavelet is following.

Transform the image Y into a multiwavelet domain by CL discrete multiwavelet transform. Then, manipulate the     multiwavelet coefficients. There are two criterions to distinguish noise from regular coefficients. The one is the Mallat?s alternate projection method based on modulus maximum principle [7]. Another is the simple shrinkage of wavelet coefficients proposed by Donoho and Johnstone. They had proposed a solution via wavelet shrinkage or soft thresholding in the wavelet domain [1]. Donoho and Johnstone?s algorithm offers the advantages of smoothness and adaptation. Wavelet shrinkage is smooth in the sense that the denoised estimate X?  has a very high probability of being as smooth as the original image X, in a variety of smoothness spaces [3]. Furthermore, wavelet shrinkage has the advantage of not adding ?bumps? or false oscillations in the process of removing noise, because of the local and smoothness- preserving nature of the wavelet transform. Mallat?s method is more practical because it is complicated for image and converges slowly and sometimes may be unstable. So we select the shrinkage method.

In the paper, we implemented Donoho?s wavelet shrinkage algorithm using several additional remarks [6]. To get the better results we modify coefficient to act on every component and level. Let ?iS represents the multiwavelet coefficient of resolution level 2i, and for component ? (as vertical ? =V, as horizontal ? =H, as diagonal ? =D). After applying a threshold ?? i , we get the modified multiwavelet coefficients  ? ?,iS , finally, perform inverse discrete multiwavelet transform  to get reconstruction image. The ?? i is obtain by minimizing  this function following. Let 2,ii i  i ||SS|| N 1)(T ??  ? ?  ?? ?=  (5) then 'i0,ii  ii )N/)N2N()(Tmin(arg ????? ??? ?+= , here  ? iN is total number of multiwavelet coefficients for  component ? and level 2i, and ?0,iN  is the number of the coefficients that be replaced by zero for ? and 2i.



IV.    EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS We now apply the multiwavelet-based to infrared image  (IR) denoising. In order to compare the results with the scalar wavelet in image denoising, we choose Daubechies D3 wavelet to denoise image, for it is orthogonal and the approximation order is 2, too.

Moreover, it has three coefficients in the dilation equation, exactly like the CL multiwavelet. This Daubechies D3 wavelet is shown in Figure 2.

Figure 3(a) is an original clear IR image. Figure 3(b) is an IR image appended Gaussian white noise, and SNR (signal-to- noise) of the figure is 4 dB.

The results of the denoised images are shown in Figure 4(a) by using the method we present above. We calculate its root mean square error (RMSE). The RMSE is defined,  NM  )]n,m(X)n,m(Y~[ RMSE  M  1m  N  1n   ?  ? =  ? ? = =                     (6)  The original image is X, its size is NM ? . The noised image is Y, and Y~  is the denoised image. Its RMSE=12.5.

In the experiments, the result of denoised image is shown in Figure 4(b) based on Daubechies D3 wavelet. Its RMSE=20.7.

Compared Figure 4(a) with Figure 4(b), we find that Figure 4(a) is more clear than Figure 4(b). It means that the multiwavelet based used in image denosing obtain better effects than the scalar one.

V.    CONCLUSIONS Multiwavelet transform technique is rather a new method,  and it has a big advantage over the other techniques that it less distorts spectral characteristics of the image denoising. The experimental results show that multiwavelet based image     denoising schemes outperform wavelet based method both subjectively and objectively.
