Motion intensity evaluation plays a very important role in both the stroke patients? rehabilitation program development and competitive athletes? daily training. The traditional motion intensity evaluation takes the heart rate or rate of perceived exertion as evaluation parameters, which can?t determine the motion intensity of peoples because everyone has subtile differences in these aspects.

I. INTRODUCTION Motion intensity is a comprehensive property to reflect the  motion speed, motion frequency and motion explosive power.

Motion intensity evaluation plays a very important role in both the stroke patients? rehabilitation program development [1] and competitive athletes? daily training. The motion intensity is an important factor for a physiotherapist to draw up the next plan for rehabilitation, and for the sports coaches to adjust their training plans.

In recent years, many studies have been conducted on motion intensity evaluation. The Heart rate or rate of perceived exertion is taken as evaluation parameters for evaluating the upper limb motion intensity [2]. But people's heart rates are different from each other, so this traditional motion intensity evaluation method based on the heart rate can efficiently distinguish the motion intensity of the same person, but not suitable for different people. Furthermore, people may have differences in age, height, weight and other basic characteristic, and this may cause the traditional method to fail to distinguish the motion intensity of different people.

BP neural network [3] is a multi-layer feed forward neural network, which is trained using error back propagation algorithm. It can learn and store a large number of input-output  mapping modes with no the mathematical equation revealing the mapping [4].

This paper proposes an upper limb motion intensity evaluation model based on BP neural network in Section III.

We design a wearable acquisition module using two three-axis acceleration sensors to collect the acceleration of the upper limb motion exercise. In Section IV, the motion intensity factors are analyzed. And the upper limb motion intensity is determined by two factors, which are the change rate of the angle between the upper arm and the lower arm, and the magnitude of acceleration. These factors are complicated nonlinear to the upper limb motion intensity grade. The traditional data processing methods are no longer able to deal with this case. So BP neural network is employed to build the upper limb motion intensity evaluation model, and the model is verified using the MATLAB neural network toolbox. The model is tested based on the 60 groups of input sample data and output sample data in Section V. And the simulation experiment shows that the model has higher efficiency in evaluating the upper motion intensity grade than the traditional methods.



II. RELATED WORKS Whether the normal population or stroke patients, it?s very  important to control the motion intensity during the exercise.

Such as the motion intensity is too small, it fails to exercise purposes; motion intensity is too large, it?s harmful to health.

In recent years, many studies have been conducted on motion intensity evaluation. Body oxygen consumption, metabolic equivalents, heart rate, rate of perceived exertion and other indicators can be the evaluation parameters in the motion intensity evaluation.

Y. Dong, T. Wang, etc. evaluate 18 stroke patients? motion intensity with K4b2 mobile cardiopulmonary exercise instrument produced by Italian Consumed firm [2]. The stroke patients come from rehabilitation medicine department of Nanning medicine university no. 1 hospital. The experiment shows that the heart rate can be useful in motion intensity evaluation. J. X use heart rate to evaluate the motion intensity of artistic gymnastics athlete?s specific motion [5]. G. Z. Zhang, J. H. Li use rate of perceived exertion to design training programs for coronary heart disease patients who discharge from hospital [6].

DOI 10.1109/CLOUDCOM-ASIA.2013.12    DOI 10.1109/CLOUDCOM-ASIA.2013.12     In the end, people may have differences in age, height, weight and other basic characteristic, and this may cause the traditional methods to fail to distinguish the motion intensity of different people.



III. THE UPPER MOTION INTENSITY EVALUATION MODEL  A. BP neural network model In this paper, two three-axis acceleration sensors are used to  get the acceleration in the upper limb motion exercise. Three factors are got by computing the measured accelerations and be the input values of the evaluation model.

Upper limb motion evaluation model is built with the application of BP neural network technique. A BP neural network model with a single hidden layer is created in this paper, with R as the input layer, S1 the hidden layer, S2 the output layer. IW is the weight matrix from the input layer to the hidden layer and LW is the weight matrix from the hidden layer to the output layer [7-8]. In addition, b1and b2 is the threshold values of the hidden and output layer respectively, and f1and f2 are the transfer functions of the hidden and output layer [9-10]. BP neural network model with a single hidden layer is shown in Fig. 1.

BP neural network model  The whole error function is defined as follows:  ? ? ? ?2  1 (t) (t)  q  i i i  E t y d ?  ? ??  It is assumed that the actual output value of the neural j in the output layer is ? ?iy t and the expected output ? ?id t at time t.

? ?E t is the whole error of the neural network at time t; q  is the  number of the output layer. A parameter ? is determined as a pre-set error margin. The model will stop working when ? ?E t is less than ?  and then the model can be applied for upper limb motion intensity evaluation.

BP neural network is a multi-layer feed forward neural network, which is trained using error back propagation algorithm. It can learn and store a large number of input-output  mapping modes with no the mathematical equation revealing the mapping. Its learning rule is the steepest descent method.

The network can adjust its weights and thresholds by spreading reverse, and can make the squared error of the network minimum.

The learning process of BP algorithm consists of the forward propagation and the backward propagation. Learning process first begins in the forward propagation part. The information which comes from input layer goes through hidden layer, and finally reaches the output layer. In the forward propagation, the neurons in the same layer doesn?t influence to each other, the neuron state only influences the neuron state in the next layer. If the output layer results fails to meet expectations, then the learning process into reverse propagation part. The network will modify the weights and thresholds in every layer to make the error signal minimum, and then the information continues to spread.

B. Design of the wearable acceleration acquisition module The wearable acceleration acquisition module uses two  three-axis acceleration sensors to collect data, which is used to compute the change rate of the upper motion angle and amplitudes of the acceleration as the inputs of the BP neural network model. It includes two parts: (1) the design of the hardware, (2) the design of the software.

1) Design of the hardware This wearable acceleration acquisition module employs an  Atmega48 processor as the main controller, Zigbee wireless module as the communication channel, Kxtj9 three-axis acceleration sensor as the sensor chip. The module obtains the upper limb acceleration data by using two three-axis acceleration sensors. The acceleration obtained by two three- axis sensors will be sent to atmega48 processor through the simulation I2C bus, and then be packaged to the Zigbee sending module, which will send the packed data to the Zigbee wireless receiver on computer side. The hardware design is illustrated in Fig. 2, the prototype of the hardware module is shown in Fig. 3 and the prototype of the PC receiver is shown in Fig. 4.

MATLAB neural network toolbox Matlab which is high technology application software  which is produced by MathWorks, have been widely used in academia and industry. Compared with Basic, C, Pascal, and other programming languages, Matlab has program readability, simple debugging features [11]. Matlab can give users great convenience especially when writing complex programs which contain complex matrix operations [12]. Matlab provides a lot of toolbox, neural network toolbox is based on the theory of artificial neural networks, and be used for neural network model designing and training [13]. In this paper, we determine Matlab as the software development environment, and use it to design and train the neural network model.



IV. INPUT VARIANCES AND OUTPUT VARIANCES  A. Input variances Based on existing measured upper limb motion intensity  values and correlative analysis, 3 factors are identified as affecting factors: (1) the change rate of the angle between the upper arm and the lower arm, (2) the magnitude of acceleration which is obtained by the acceleration sensor in the upper arm, (3) the magnitude of acceleration which is obtained by the acceleration sensor in the lower arm. Each of which affects the upper limb motion intensity to a certain degree.

The change rate of the angle between the upper arm and the lower arm can reflect upper limb motion speed, and the magnitude of acceleration which comes from the three-axis acceleration sensor fixed in the upper arm and the lower arm can reflect motion explosive power. In this experiment, the frequency of capturing acceleration is higher than the frequency of motions. The input values can be defined as follows:   2 2 2   2 2 2   | angle angle | (1)  1 1 1 1 (2)  2 2 2 2 (3)  n  k k k  n  k k k k k n  k k k k k  RA n  MU x y z b n  ML x y z b n  ? ?  ?  ?  ? ?  ? ? ? ?  ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  ?    Where, kangle  is the angle between the upper arm and the  lower arm which is computed by the k th? acceleration obtained by two sensors (k=1,2,3?),  kangle  is zero when k is 1. And  1 , 1 , 1k k kx y z is the x-axis data, y-axis data and z-axis data of the k th?  acceleration which is obtained by the sensor fixed in the upper arm, 2 , 2 , 2k k kx y z is the x-axis data, y-axis data and z-axis data of the k th?  acceleration which is obtained by the sensor fixed in the lower arm. 1 , 2k kb b is the threshold for computing the magnitude of the k th?  acceleration obtained by the sensor fixed in the upper arm and the magnitude of the k th?  acceleration obtained by the sensor fixed in the lower arm. We can use the thresholds 1 , 2k kb b to avoid the influence to the magnitude of the acceleration because of the gravity.

B. Input values measuring principle Before carrying angle detection, first the sensors are fixed  to the upper arm and the lower arm, as shown in Fig. 6. With the change in position of the upper arm and the lower arm, the arm angle can be measured after computing the acceleration obtained by the three-axis acceleration sensors.

Fig. 6. Angle detection diagram  The upper arm and the lower arm always have a certain angle with vertical direction during exercise. Through analysis the acceleration?s each axis data which is generated by the gravity; we can determine the space position of the upper arm and the lower arm.

Acceleration sensor  Grivity orientation  y orientation of sensor z orientation of sensor  Fig. 7. Three axis of the acceleration sensor  As shown in Fig. 7, when the sensor is in a stationary state, the y axis data and z axis data is generated by the gravity. We can determine the angle ?by the y axis data and the z axis data.

The computation formula is as follows:  =arctan( )z y  C. Design of output variances The upper limb motion intensity is divided into four grades:  excellent, good, fair, poor. Four binary numbers are used to represent the upper limb motion intensity grades, output variances need to be designed as a four-dimensional vector.

Corresponding diagram is shown in Table I.

V. THE EVALUATION MODEL VERIFICATION  A. Capturing the input and output sample data In the paper, all the experiments are taken in Shandong  Province Health Management Engineering Technology Center.

15 volunteers are selected to take part in the experiment. Each volunteer does the specified upper limb exercise four times.

Therefore there are 60 groups of sample data in total. In each exercise, we will collect 200 acceleration values from two sensors on the upper arm and the lower arm. One input sample data will be got from the 200 acceleration. The scene graph is shown in Fig. 8.

Fig. 8. Experimental data collection  When volunteers do the upper limb exercise with the wearable acceleration acquisition module, the medical professional nearby will judge their upper limb intensity grade.

The measured intensity grade will be as the output sample data.

B. Determine the neural network parameters In this paper, the network model is built using the Matlab  neural network toolbox, which provides many functions to train and test BP neural network model.

According to the characteristics of the sample and the network structure, logsig and tansig are respectively selected as the hidden layer and output layer transfer functions. The training function of BP neural network is traingd. Network training parameters are shown in Table II.

TABLE II. NETWORK TRAINING PARAMETERS  Training times Training goal Learning rate  10000 0.01 0.1  Newff function is used to create a BP neural network with the hidden layer has eight neurons, the output layer four neuron.

Main procedures are as follows:  P=[]?;T=[]?;  P_Test=[]?;T_Test=[]?;  net=newff(minmax(P),[8,4],{'tansig','logsig'},'traingd');  net.trainParam.epochs=10000;  net.trainParam.goal=0.01;  net.trainParam.lr=0.1;  net.trainparam.show=1;  net=train(net,P,T);  a=sim(net,P_Test);  [m,b,r]=postreg(a,T_Test);     C. Model result analysis The upper limb motion intensity evaluation model is built  through application of MATLAB BP neural network toolbox.

The input variances are the change rate of the angle between the upper arm and the lower arm, the magnitude of acceleration which is obtained by the acceleration sensor fixed in the upper arm, and the magnitude of acceleration which is obtained by the acceleration sensor fixed in the lower arm. The output variances are the measured upper limb motion intensity grade.

The three-layer BP neural network input nodes is 60 rows 3 columns matrix, and the output nodes is 60 row 4 columns matrix. The best network structure is got through adjusting the number of hidden layer nodes. Then we determine the number of the hidden layer nodes is 8. The training process is shown in Fig. 9. In the figure, we can find the error of the network reaches 10-2.

Fig. 9. Network training figure  Linear regression analysis is done by comparing the actual network output values and the desired output values. It?s easy to find that the tracking to the expected is good in the linear regression results diagram. Correlation index R is 0.969 which is shown in Fig. 10.

Fig. 10. Linear regression results of training sample  In the next step, 15 test sample data are taken to the model testing. The comparison between the actual network output values and the measured output values is show in table III. It?s  easy to find that the error between the actual network output values and the measured output values is small.

As shown in Table III, through observing the actual output values and the fitted values, we can find that 30 fitted values are right among the 32 fitted values and correct rate reaches 93.75%. Error of the evaluation network model is small, and the performance has been able to meet the requirements of the application.

VI. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, the network model we build can better deal  the nonlinear relationship between the input values computed by the accelerations which are obtained by the three-axis acceleration sensors and the measured upper limb motion intensity values. From the experiment results, we can find that the BP neural network can be more accurately to evaluate the intensity values of the upper limb motion. Compared to the methods which evaluate the upper limb motion intensity grade by heart rate or rate of perceived exertion, this method is more convenient and more accuracy. Moreover, the input sample data which come from different people can be comparable.

Through the testing data, the correct rate reaches 93.75%.

The output variances are the measured motion intensity grade. Medical professionals judge the upper limb motion intensity grade by observing volunteers? complement of the upper limb exercise. The measured motion intensity grade will be with errors and chance. How to judge the upper limb motion intensity accuracy will be an important optimization direction for this method.
