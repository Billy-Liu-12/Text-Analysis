Abstract: Using the concepts of typical gas's concentration  and cumulative frequency in analysis of the reliability data for  dealing with the pretreatment of data of DGA, two new  normalized methods which named characteristic  normalization and mix normalization are presented in this  paper. The Fisher rule to evaluate the results of the two  pretreatment methods is also introduced. The evaluation of  the results indicates that both of the two data pretreatment  methods can achieve the purpose of big difference in the  value of mean between classes and small difference in  dispersion of a class. The DGA data of the failure  transformers are treated by different normalization methods as  the training samples, and then the samples are trained in the  compound neural networks which use the CP algorithm. The  diagnosis results of the test samples indicate that the new  methods may help to improve the precision of network  diagnosis.

There are two universal neural network normalized  methods: general normalization[1] and cumulative frequency  normalization[2][3]. In the general normalization, the  proportion of different gases in total gas concentrations is  normalized. This method corresponds to the feature that gas  content in oil reflects failure type and has real physical  meaning. But the potentially valuable information contained  by some minor components tends to be neglected as a result  of gas content feature.

Cumulative frequency normalization strengthens the  dispersion of samples which makes samples distribute in the  interval [0, 1] and has strong mathematical meaning. However,  this method only compares the same kind of gas  longitudinally without considering gases' concentration in the  same group. So the physical meaning is unclear. Consequently,  finding a new normalized method which can not only  strengthen the typical gas's characteristic of DGA but also  differentiate samples in different conditions plays a key role  in the improvement of accuracy of neural network diagnoses.

2 CHARACTERISTIC NORMALIZATION AND MIX NORMALIZAITON  Dealing with the advantages and disadvantages of  general normalization, two new normalized methods which  named characteristic normalization and mix normalization are  presented in this paper. The process of characteristic  normalization is:  The input data of such pattern  Based on the analysis results of dissolved gases' contents  in transformer oil, the failure diagnosis problem can be solved  effectively by using artificial neural network. In practical  analysis of DGA , the sensitivity reflected by different typical  gases has big difference. For example, the content of C2H2 in  transformer oil is usually less, but it must be strictly  monitored once it appears. Conversely, the content of H2 is  comparatively high, but its reflection to failure is less  sensitive. Therefore, the potentially valuable information  contained by some minor components will be neglected if the  results of contents of DGA are treated directly as the input of  neural network. It indicates that the differences between data  must be decreased by using normalized treatment in order to  normalized as follows:  can be    CICED2008 Technical Session 1 Distribution network equipment  H2 k  H2 k  H2 k+~kH2k+Cf4k +~H4k+~H6k  r-H2 k  ~H2k '-2 ~H2k+Cf4k +~H4k+~H6k  k Cf4k Cf4 (I)  ~H2k+C14k+~H4k +~H6k  r-H4 k  ~H4k '-2 ~H2k+Cf4k +~H4k+~H6k  r_R k  ~H6k '-2 ~H2k+Cf4k +~H4k+~H6k  Eq.(I) shows that after the treatment of characteristic  normalization, H2 reflects the content of H2 in hydrogen  hydrocarbon and various kinds of gases reflect their contents  in hydrocarbon gas. Literature[4][5] indicates that the content  of H2 in hydrogen hydrocarbon and the contents of various  kinds of gases in hydrocarbon gas are closely related with the  failure type of power transformer. Therefore, the  characteristic normalization has strong physical meaning.

Meanwhile, because the content of H2 in typical gas is likely  to be comparatively high, Eq.(I) normalized hydrocarbon gas  by using the ratio of hydrocarbon gas and total hydrocarbon  gas instead of the ratio of hydrocarbon gas and hydrogen  hydrocarbon. After such treatment, some valuable information  won't be neglected because data of hydrocarbon gas is too  tiny. So the characteristic normalization also has strong  mathematical meaning.

For the cause of typical gas is complicated, it is difficult  to well differentiate certain failure only by a single treatment  of these three methods. So mix normalization is presented.

The process of mix normalization is:  Ak = (H2 k ,C2H2  k ,CH4 k ,C2H4  k ,C2H6 k  )  H2 in input samples is probabilistically normalized;  C2H2, C2H4, CH4 and C2H6 are characteristically  normalized as follows:  by characteristic normalization. Therefore, mix normalization  enhances the mathematical meaning of the algorithm.

3 THE ESTABLISHMENT OF CP NEURAL NETWORKS  In view of the fact that different dissolved typical gases  in oil react differently to various failure types, it is improper  to identify all kinds of failures by uniform input vector for a  single neural network model. To realize better classification,  it's desirable to distinguish failures by using step-by-step  division. Based on this consideration, the article refers to the  gradual-judgment compound neural network pattern. The  Fig.I shows its structure. Because the problem that whether  the nature of overheating failure refers to solid insulation  certainty by analysis of gas in oil has not been satisfactorily  solved[7], it is more suitable to take H2, CH4, C2H6, C2H4  and C2H2 as network model input. To well reflect the  physical premonition of failure point (e.g. overheating,  discharge etc.), it is more proper to take high-temperature  overheating, low-temperature overheating, arc discharge and  spark discharge as network model output. The structure figure  for compound neural networks model of power transformer is  shown in Fig.I,  (2)  Spark  Discharg  high-temperature low-temperature  overheating  The definition of mix normalization shows that treating  hydrocarbon gas by using the ratio of hydrocarbon gas and  hydrogen hydrocarbon and H2 by using probabilistic  normalization can prevent the complexity generated by H2. It  is difficult to find the distinction between some failures only   Fig.I The structurefigure for compoundneural networksmodel  of power transformer    CICED2008 Technical Session 1 Distribution network equipment  (3)  ANNI---ANN2-2: ANNI fault diagnosis model. ANN2-1  is discharge fault diagnose model and ANN2-2 is thermal fault  diagnose model. By studying their training samples set, these  three fault diagnose models take CP network model[8] as  essential classifier to obtain the description of concrete decision  rule and select more directional input characteristic vectors for  them regarding to different neural network modules.

RULE 0: According to the operation experience for  many years, chromatographic observing value and factor of  created gas specified in "Preventive Test Regulation for  Electric Power Equipments"[9] is regarded as the limit to  judge whether transformer is abnormal.

RULE I and RULE 2: Distinguishing discharge fault  and thermal fault by the content of C2H2 in total hydrocarbon  gas, this paper carries out a statistical analysis on 300  collected training samples and revealed the following findings:  C2H2 accounts for 16.254% of total hydrocarbon gas in  discharge faults and maximal 5.0I% in thermal fault.

Therefore, RULE I can be defined as whether C2H2's  percentage of total hydrocarbon gas is greater than or equal to  16%; RULE 2 can be defined as C2H2's percentage of total  hydrocarbon gas is greater than or equal to 5%. The procedure  of diagnose is as follows: For fault sample, the fault is  considered a discharge fault if C2H2 accounts for more than  16% of total hydrocarbon gas, being diagnosed directly by  discharge fault diagnose model ANN2-1; the fault is  considered a thermal fault if C2H2 accounts for less than 5%  of total hydrocarbon gas, being diagnosed by thermal fault  diagnose model ANN2-2. And if the percentage ofC2H2 falls  between these two values, diagnose by thermal fault diagnose  model ANN2-2 first. According to the result, diagnose  whether it is arc discharge or spark discharge by discharge  fault diagnose model ANN2-1 if the diagnose result is  high-temperature thermal fault, if not, do not have to do this.

4 SIMULATION RESULTS  4.1 THE ESTABLISHMENT OF DATA SAMPLES SET  On the basis of statistic large fault examples, 420 times  fault transformers which have comparatively clear factual  conclusions are selected as fault samples set. The distribution  of all the failure types in the set is shown in Tab.I.

The function  of Fisher rule is as follows [10].

Pretreat training  samples of each network by three different normalization  methods and find out the Fisher rule values of their results. In  order to state more clearly, general normalization, cumulative  frequency normalization and characteristic normalization is  referred to as Method-I, Method-2 and Method-3 respectively.

For the results, see Tab.2-Tab.4.

This  illustrates that to treat training samples of model ANN1 and  ANN2-2 by characteristic normalization and those of model  ANN2-1 by mix normalization can not only strengthen the  typical gas's characteristic of DGA but also differentiate  samples in different conditions.

4.3 COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF  NETWORK DIAGNOSE RESULTS FOR  SEVERAL INPUT PATTERN When the networks have the same perimeters, evaluate  the results that treated by different normalization methods  with CP compound neural network.

Method-4 is mix normalization.

Tab.5 indicates that when the networks have the same  perimeters, the diagnosis rate of the network which has been  treated by characteristic normalization is maximal for both  model ANNI and ANN2-2, and so does that treated by mix  normalization for model ANN2-1. This shows that when the  networks have the same perimeters, characteristic  normalization can increase the diagnosis rate of model ANN1  and ANN2-2 and mix normalization can increase the  diagnosis rate of model ANN2-1.

After being treated by characteristic  normalization, input data is [0.2337 0.2441 0.1539 0.3073  0.2946] and diagnose result of model ANNI is [0.9067  0.0933]. According to maximum membership principle, this  denotes malfunction. The percentage of C2H2 in total   hydrocarbon gas is 29.46%, greater than 16% specified in  RULE1, so it is discharge fault. After being treated by mix  normalization, input data is [0.9900 0.2441 0.1539 0.3073  0.2946] and diagnose result of model ANN2-1 is [0.0827  0.9173]. According to maximum membership principle, this  denotes spark discharge fault. Real test result is: there is a  black spot which is about 250mm from equalizing ball  measured approximately 7 X 7mm2 in porcelain surface under  the sleeve of phase A. After careful inspection, find out that  the black spot is an air hole with a carbon black inside. Hence,  the fault is a spark discharge fault. CP network diagnose  results correspond with the real test.

Sample 2 in Tab.6 is chromatographic data of a  transformer's oil. According to the recommended  concentration observing value of DGA in DLT/T722-2000,  the transformer is faulty because the content of H2, C2H2 and  total hydrocarbon gas has exceeded bid badly. The percentage  of C2H2 in total hydrocarbon gas is 44.6%, greater than 16%  specified in RULE1, so it is discharge fault. After being  treated by mix normalization, input data is [0.98 0.2433 0.067  0.2433 0.4460] and diagnose result of model ANN2-1 is  [0.8034 0.1966]. According to maximum membership  principle, this denotes spark discharge fault. Real test result is:  there are 8 breakdown spots in the first insulating carboard of  the folding screen in the first layer from phase A's external  and there is penetrating tree discharge in the second insulating  carboard. Hence, the fault is an arc discharge fault. CP  network diagnose results correspond with the real test.

Sample 3 in Tab.6 is chromatographic data of a  transformer's oil. According to the recommended  concentration observing value of DGA in DLT/T722-2000,  the transformer is faulty because the content of total  hydrocarbon gas has exceeded bid badly. The percentage of  C2H2 in total hydrocarbon gas is 3.9%, less than 5%  specified in RULE1, so it is thermal fault. After being treated  by characteristic normalization, input data is [0.3817 0.2370  0.058 0.6658 0.040] and diagnose result of model ANN2-2 is  [0.8094 0.1906]. According to maximum membership  principle, this denotes high-temperature thermal fault. Real  test result is: the tap switch moving contact of phase C and  dial records differs 1200 ? The breakback contact is eroded  seriously and moving contact is eroded slightly. Hence, the  fault is a high-temperature thermal fault. CP network  diagnose results correspond with the real test.

5 CONCLUSIONS  (l)By comparative analysis, both the training    CICED2008 Technical Session 1 Distribution network equipment  samples' Fisher rule values under different  normalizations and the results of different input patterns  indicates that to treat training samples of discharge fault  by mix normalization and training samples of thermal  fault by characteristic normalization can well decrease  the difference between samples and increase the  diagnose rate.

(2)With the characteristic of power transformer  insulating fault, the network training efficiency and  diagnose precision are both enhanced by judging  different fault types with compound neural network.

After the analysis of example calculation, to apply  compound diagnose network constructed by artificial  neural network model based on CP algorithm that taken  as essential classifier to power transformer insulating  fault diagnose that based on DGA can achieve better  results. The test results of fault examples illustrate that  the algorithm is an accurate diagnose mode and has  more precise diagnose result.
