A Study on the Comparison between  Content-Based and Preference-Based

Abstract - Since business markets have the feature of small number of customers with tremendous amount of sales, it?s quite cost-effective to offer personalized recommendations to enhance customer responsiveness and relationship marketing.

Two current popular recommendation systems both from content- and preference-based approach are conducted to compare their recommendation quality.

In sum, ARM performed better than RFM-CF in this case. It implied that it? beneficial to segment customers, and then to provide customized services for different customer segments.



I. INTRODUCTION Sherden (1994) [15] proposed a 80-20-30 rule,  which says that the upper 20% valuable customers would normally contribute around 80% of companies? total profit; nevertheless the lower 30% valuable customers would make loss about half the profit. Consequently, it?s very important to dedicate businesses? limited marketing resources to satisfy the most valuable customers? needs [5, 6, 7]. Personalized Recommendation Systems are developing quickly under this background.

The major purposes of this study can be summarized as follows: (1) Segmenting customers based on their customer life time value (CLV), (2) Investigating effective personalized recommendations to enhance customer responsiveness, and (3) Keeping high value loyal customers through relationship marketing.



II. BACKGROUND  2.1 Customer Lifetime Value  2.2 Personalized Recommendation Systems Current popular personalized recommendation  systems can be classified into content-based and preference-based approach. The content-based approach, representative by association rule mining, offers product recommendations according to customers? purchase history. While the preference-based approach, representative by collaborative filtering, makes product recommendations based on other customers with similar interests or preferences [10].

These two major recommendation systems will be introduced in the following sections.

2.2.1 Association Rule Mining The association rule mining (ARM) [1,15,16] is a  popular technique in data mining field. Sarwar et al. [13] described the ARM as follows. For each customer, a customer-transaction was created to record all the products previously purchased by him or her. The transactions were grouped according to the clusters of customers. The ARM was then applied to extract the recommendation rules from transactions associated with each cluster.

Let Xu represent the set of products previously purchased by customer u. For each recommendation rule X ? Y, if X belongs to Xu, then all products in Y ? Xu are the candidate products for recommendation to customer u. All candidate products were sorted and ranked according to the associated confidence of the recommendation rules. The N highest ranked candidate products were selected as the top-N recommended products.  Customer lifetime value (CLV) is generally  measured by RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) Analysis [6]. Since different customers make different contributions to businesses, it?s beneficial to differentiate customers efficiently and effectively. The way to reach this goal basically follows the following procedure: (1) Identifying where the customers are, (2) Differentiating customers, (3) Interacting with customer segments, and (4) Providing customized services. Since businesses all have limited resources, it?s essential to concentrate marketing resources available to the most valuable customers.

Based on results of CLV analysis, customers can be segmented by clustering analysis of data mining.

DOI 10.1109/SKG.2008.89     2.2.2 Collaborative Filtering A typical collaborative filtering (CF) [2] method  employs nearest-neighbor algorithms to recommend products to a target customer u based on the preferences of neighbors who are those customers having similar preference to customer u. preferences are generally defined by customer purchasing behavior or their preference rating on products.

Customers are ranked by their similarity measures  in relation to the target customer u. The K highest ranked customers are selected as the K nearest neighbors of customer u. The products purchased by these K neighbors are scanned to find and sort frequency count.

The N most frequent products that have not yet been purchased by target customer u are selected as the top-N recommendations. The above-mentioned procedure is then called KNN-based CF.

2.2.3 Evaluation Metrics In order to measure the quality of a  recommendation, two metrics, recall and precision, are commonly used [3, 12, 16].

Fig. 1 Research procedure Recall is the fraction of interesting product items  that can be located, which indicates the effectiveness of a recommendation to locate interesting products. Recall can be shown as: Recall = (number of correctly recommended items)/(number of interesting items).

Precision represents the extent to which the recommended products are really interesting to customers, which can be shown as: Precision = (number of correctly recommended items)/(number of recommended items).

Though increasing the number of recommended items tended to increase the recall, it decreases the precision at the same time. As a result, an F1-metric [3,9,13] could be used to balance the trade-off between them, which can be shown as: F1 = (2 X Recall X Precision)/(Recall + Precision).



III. METHODOLOGY  3.1 Research Design  3.2 CLV Analysis In this study, RFM analysis is conducted to measure  customer lifetime value (CLV). Here, we follow the treatment of Hughes (1994) [8] to assign all RFM variables with five value intervals from 1 to 5. Data are processed on the basis of 2008/04/28. The results can be shown as in figure 2.

Fig. 2: Results of CLV analysis  This study chose an automobile part company (N) as subject. N Company, which is located in Taiwan, has dealt with the in international trade of automobile parts for over 15 years.

Since business markets have the feature of small number of customers with tremendous amount of sales, it?s quite cost-effective to offer personalized recommendations to enhance customer responsiveness and relationship marketing.

Consequently two popular recommendation systems are conducted to find the most appropriate one.

The research procedure can be drawn as figure 1.

3.3 Clustering Analysis TABLE 2 RECOMMENDATION QUALITY OF ARM After each customer?s CLV was obtained, a  clustering analysis based on K-means algorithms was conducted to segment customers. The results can be shown as in table 1.

Consequently, it?s named RFM-based Collaborative Filtering (RFM-CF). The similarity among customers can be measured by computing the Pearson correlation coefficient based on the RFM values of customers as defined below [9].

IV. EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION The major results of this experiment can be listed as  follows.

4.1 ARM Recommendation  Top-2 Top-3 Top-4 Avg. F1  Group1 0.381 0.397 0.422 0.400  Group2 0.142 0.262 0.272 0.225  Group3 0.640 0.567 0.526 0.578 Avg. F1 0.388 0.409 0.406   From the above table, ARM performs best for the  third group, the lower value customers; while it performs worst for the first group; it performs close to average F1 for the second group.

One possible explanation is that the lower value customers buy fewer kinds of product; therefore the recommendation quality can be improved due to the simplicity. Contrary, the higher value customers make tremendous kinds and amount of products; it?s hard to offer appropriate recommendations.

4.2 RFM-CF Recommendation  In RFM-CF recommendation, we tried different nearest neighbors (K from 5-10) and different recommendations (from Top-3 to Top-7). The results can be shown in table 3.

TABLE 3  RECOMMENDATION QUALITY OF RFM-CF RFM-CF Top-N 5-NN 7-NN 10-NN Avg. F1  Top-3 0.354 0.335 0.370 0.353  Top-5 0.347 0.325 0.386 0.353  Top-7 0.351 0.328 0.392 0.357  Avg. F1 0.326 0.327 0.389  From above table, we can see RFM-CF performs marginally best for referencing more nearest neighbors.

And there are not significantly differences for different recommendation items.

4.3 The Comparison between ARM and RFM-CF Recommendations  In order to compare the recommendation quality of ARM and RFM-CF, we summarized the F1 metric under different K nearest neighbors and different top-N recommendations. The results can be shown as in table 4.

In ARM, after several try and error, we set up the threshold of minimum support to 0.5, minimum confidence to 0.6, and item set to 3. Besides, we randomly divide data into two groups: 75% as training set, and 25% as test set. The recommendation quality of this approach as measured by F1 metric is shown in table 2.

TABLE 4 COMPARISON OF RECOMMENDATION QUALITY  BETWEEN ARM AND RFM-CF RFM-CF  Top-N ARM 5-NN 7-NN 10-NN Avg. F1 Top-2 0.388 0.354 0.335 0.370 0.353 Top-3 0.409 0.347 0.325 0.386 0.353 Top-4 0.406 0.351 0.328 0.392 0.357  Avg. F1   0.326 0.327 0.389   From above table, it?s obviously that ARM performed steadily better than RFM-CF. The implication of this finding is that it is beneficial to segment customers first, then providing customized recommendations for different customer segmentation.

The poorer performance of RFM-CF may be due to two major issues to be addressed [4]. The first issue is related to sparsity. In a large e-commerce site, there are millions of products, and so customers may rate only a very small portion of those products. Such sparsity problem in ratings makes the formation of neighborhood inaccurate, hence resulting in poor recommendation.

The second issue is related to scalability.

Recommendation systems for large e-commence site have to deal with millions of customers and products, the nearest neighbors algorithm is often time-consuming and scales poorly in practice.

To overcome the problems with CF, such as saprsity and scalability, other algorithms, such as product taxonomy, can be combined for further researches.

Besides, study toward different industry would also helpful for the insights of personalized recommendation systems. Lastly, improved breadth and width of experimental data in further researches might enhance the objectivity and generalization of research findings.
