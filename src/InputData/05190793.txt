Investigation on Diseases of Tibet Murals Using 3D Laser Scanning Technology

Abstract Murals are the important components of culture and  arts of Tibet. Tibet's murals are mainly painted on the walls of temples, palaces and homes. Unhappily, these murals have been ruined or are being ruined by some diseases such as cracking, hollowing, falling off, fluid erosion, dirt, and so on. It is necessary to use new technologies to protect murals. June 2007, we, from Capital Normal University and National Institute of Cultural Property collected a lot of laser range images and digital images of Tibet?s murals. We proposed that integrating range data and image data to investigate mural diseases and give the location, length and area of mural diseases. Moreover, we also presented a parallel computing method to process the huge range data, and discussed to align the images into a big image based on SIFT.

1. Introduction  Tibet?s murals are treasures of Buddha culture in China, even in the world. They are very significant for the study of Tibet. However, due to many reasons, the murals are suffering from different kinds of disease, such as cracking, hollowing, falling off, fluid erosion, dirt, and so on. The murals need to be repaired, but how to repair is a big problem. Before restoring, we need to know the types of diseases, the distribution of diseases, and the size of diseases.

This work is funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC 40601081), Beijing Science and Technology Nova project (2006B57) and National Science and Technology Support Program (2006BAJ15B01-02).

The earlier methods of disease investigation, due to technical conditions at that time, only used text and simple graphics to recode the contents of murals, the methods are too easy to describe the details of diseases.

Now somebody uses digital camera to record the murals.

We know that it is difficult to determine the disease size.

Somebody directly use the ruler to measure the size of disease. Maybe, this method can ensure the accuracy of points not the whole accuracy. We need a fast 3D scanning technology which guarantees can ensure the accuracy of the whole measurement.

3D laser scanner can record the geometric details of the murals through getting a dense 3D point cloud, and then digital camera can capture the texture details of mural. It is a good idea using laser range data and image data to inspect the mural diseases. In fact, 3D laser scanning technology has been applied into heritage conservation in the recent years. A team of 30 faculty, staff, and students from Stanford University and the University of Washington spent the two years in Italy digitized sculptures by Michelangelo[1]. The National Research Council of Canada (NRC) has done a lot of research work in heritage preservation [2]. However, there are few reports about the application of 3D laser scanning technology in investigation of mural diseases.

The goal of this paper is to propose a new method of investigation on mural diseases by 3D laser scanning to determine mural disease location, size, length, etc.. We collected a lot of laser range images from and digital images of the murals of Jokhang Temple and Zhatang Temple.

Generally, every mural is about 50m2, including about 4GB range data, so there is a challenge of processing the huge range data. Meanwhile, there is also a difficulty of processing the huge images. Thence in the remaining sections, we describe a parallel computing method to process the huge range data (section2), align the images into a big image based on SIFT(section3),   DOI 10.1109/IV.2009.109    DOI 10.1109/IV.2009.109     and discuss some of the strategies about the disease investigation (section4).

2. Huge range data processing  The data which close to or exceed capacity of computer memory can not be processed by the traditional methods. So we employ the parallel computing to deal with the huge range data on a high performance computer with 32 CPUs and 64GB RAM.

In fact, the step of registration of multiple range images needs more CPUs and computer memory. So we design a parallel algorithm to align the range images into a common coordinate system. Figure1 shows the pipeline of the method, and then Figure2 is a result of registration.

The main process assigns the range images into different sub-processes, and all range images are registered together in sub-processes synchronously, finally, return the result to the main process.

Moreover, the range data of each mural with about 4GB is too much, so we need to remove some data points before modeling. We use a resample method based on curvature. Figure3 is the result of resample which keep geometric details.

Finally, we still use the parallel computing idea to create 3D model. The range data of each mural is divided into different groups and sent into the different sub- process. Next, in the main process, all sub-models are zippered into the whole model.

3. Creating panoramic image  The almost entire walls were painted over the murals in temples in Tibet, very beautiful. We captured some sequences of overlapping images for murals. We want to make a big panoramic image which is necessary to analyze the mural diseases. We use Lowe?s [5] Scale  Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT features), which are geometrically invariant under similarity transforms and invariant under affine changes in intensity. Panoramic Stitching Algorithm[4,8] :  Input: N images with 30% overlap from a hand-handle camera, which we keep the camera is parallel with murals and capture images from the different viewpoints.

1) Find SIFT features in all images  2) For adjacent images: ? Match features to get  correct correspondences ? Solve for homography  3) Project images on common ?image plane?  4) Blend overlapping images to obtain panorama  We created a panorama from 22 images using the above method (Figure4).

Figure2. The registration of 194 range images  Figure3. The result of resample  4. Disease analysis  All of the above works serve as mural disease analysis. While scanning the object using 3D laser scanner, we can obtain two complete registered images with the same resolution: range image and reflectance image. Range images describe the geometric changes, and reflectance images show some material changes.

They both play the two important roles during diseases investigation. We can recognize cracking, hollowing, falling, and so on from 3D model without reflectance.

Main process  Registration of group  Registration of group  Registration of group  Registration of group  Assign rang images into Sub-process  Figure1. The pipeline of the parallel algorithm     We can see fluid erosion from the 3D model with reflectance. For example, we could see the fluid erosions and the detailed mural features from figure 5(a), see the cracking and the hollowing from figure 5(b), and we can distinguish the traces of drawing the mural from figure 5(c). Moreover, when computing the distance errors between 3D model and plane, the hollowing is distinct in the error map, just like 5(d).

The above experiments show 3D laser scanning is a good method to inspect the mural disease, and we can see the disease changes.

Of course, it is of great importance for mural disease investigation to generate the measurable 3D texture model through mapping the images from different angles, different times, and different focal length onto 3D model.

We process this question in three steps:  (1) Create a basic 3D model from images according to multiview geometry.

Figure4. Panoramic image  (c) (d) Figure5. 3D model  (a) 3D model with reflectance; (b) 3D model without reflectance; (c) Edge extraction from 3D model; (d) Error map  (a) (b)     (2) Build a fine detailed 3D model from high- accuracy laser scanning data.

(3) Merge the models from (1) and (2) and generate 3D texture model.

(4) Correct color between different images.

We can find the more types of diseases from 3D  models with reflectance and without reflectance, and 3D texture model. But we do not know what the diseases are.

So we pleased some professionals to distinguish the more types of diseases from the panoramic of the mural firstly, and then we marked the diseases using 3D models and 3D texture and determine position and size of diseases. For example, figure 6 and figure 7, the professionals help us points out that how many diseases there are in the murals and what they are, we mapped the images processed by the professionals onto the corresponding 3D models, and then determined size and position of the diseases. Table1 is one example of disease in investigation records   Figure7. Cracking marks  Table1.

Conclusions  Mural survey is a complex task, and we proposed an approach to investigate on mural diseases by integrating 3D laser data and image data. Experiments show it is good to use 3D laser scanning to inspect mural diseases.

One of the tangible results of our project is that we used a new technology to mural diseases analysis and succeeded.
