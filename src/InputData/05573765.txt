I. INTRODUCTION  With the rapid development of Internet, the network has become an indispensable source of information.

People rely heavily on computer and network systems, which makes it necessary to ensure the safety of computer and network systems. Intrusion Detection System (IDS), essential to secure network environment, has been paid more and more attention to and has developed a lot.

However, the IDS model adopting the traditional intrusion detection technology is quite limited in validity, self-adaptability, and scalability[1]. A research focus to resolve this issue is to introduce the data mining technology excelling in information into the IDS, which makes the IDS automatically produce accurate detection model from a large number of audit data.



II. INTRUSION DETECTION TECHNOLOGY  Intrusion Detection (ID) is the detection and identification of malicious attacks on computer systems and network systems, or other information systems in broader sense, which collects and analyzes data from a computer system or network environment, finding suspicious attacking behavior or unusual events, and takes certain measures to prevent attacks to reduce potential losses. A combination of soft wares and hard wares for  intrusion detection is called an intrusion detection system (IDS). Its difference from other security products is that it needs more intelligence, for it must be able to get the data analyzed, and from which obtain useful results. Therefore, a qualified intrusion detection system can greatly simplify the administrator's work to ensure the secure operation of network.

A  Classification of Intrusion Detection System  In the network environment, there are three main types of intrusion detection systems? host-based intrusion detection systems, network-based intrusion detection systems and distributed intrusion detection system.

According to their adoption of different technology, intrusion detection systems can be divided into two categories: anomaly detection and signature-based detection.

1?Anomaly detection: Anomaly detection, also called activity-based detection, refers to monitoring intrusion based on the deviation of the user's activity or of the use of resources from the normal conditions instead of the appearance of specific acts. When the system is in operation, the anomaly detection program produces the current active contour, compares it with the original contour, and updates the original one at the same time.

When an obvious deviation occurs, it is considered to be an intrusion. Behavior-based detection is independent of the system, thus it can be used generally. It may even be able to detect attacking methods that have never appeared before. Yet it is impossible to describe comprehensively every user?s behavior within the system, so its main drawback is the high rate of false negative. On the other hand, the statistical summary tables need to be updated constantly. If the intruders know that a system is under monitor of the intrusion detection system, they deliberately train the detection systems for some time, so   DOI 10.1109/ISME.2010.47       that after a period of time, the initially considered anomaly behavior can be regarded as normal[3].

2 ? Signature-based detection: In the detection, intrusion process model and the traces it left in the observed system are the basis for decision making, therefore, we can define certain malicious signature activities in advance based on rules of thumb or expert knowledge, and then compare them with the observed events so as to judge whether the system has performed such malicious activities. Signature-based detection grounds on the known system defects and intrusion modes. It can accurately detect certain attacks, but with its over-reliance on pre-defined security policy, the system  can not detect unknown attacks, thus causing false dismissal.

B  Intrusion Detection System Model  Intrusion detection model is a set of mechanism to describe the behavior of network users as normal or intrusion, including the model library, rule set, decision tree, the system state, the statistical profile, and so on. One of the research priorities of ID is how to build intrusion detection models, to generate from massive audit data normal activity profile that can most effectively distinguish normal activities from anomaly ones, or to extract effectively from them the mode of intrusion[4].

The basic principle of intrusion detection is illustrated in Figure 1.

C  Problems of the Current Intrusion Detection System  The limitations of the current intrusion detection methods mainly lie in the lack of effectiveness, adaptability and scalability. The existing rule base and knowledge base, together with the statistical methods are hand-coding based on expert knowledge. When facing the complicated network environment, expert knowledge is often incomplete and inaccurate. Experts often only focus on analysis of known attack methods, for unknown ones, it takes time to study. Expert rules and statistical methods are usually set for a specific network environment; therefore, it is difficult to re-use the IDS in new network environment.

In view of the deficiencies of current Intrusion Detection System, this paper applies data mining techniques to intrusion detection systems, making a data-mining-based intrusion detection system model[5].



III. DATA MINING TECHNIQUES  A  The Definition of Data Mining  Data Mining (DM) is a process in which some hidden predictive information and knowledge are extracted from massive incomplete, noisy, and vague data at random.

With the rapid development of information technology, there is a dramatic increase in the amount of data people accumulate, often estimated with TB. There becomes an urgent need to find ways to help people extract useful  rule extracting  History activity  clock  main rule set processing  engine anomaly  record  study  activities  rule design and  revision,  audit  new activity  renewa  buildin  Figure 1 Common Intrusion Detection Model       knowledge from a sea of data. Data Mining is a data-processing technology developed in compliance with this need. It is a key step in knowledge discovery.

B  Data Mining Algorithms  There are many methods to analyze data mining. The ones commonly used in current intrusion detection systems are: association algorithm, sequence analysis algorithm and classification algorithm.

1) Association algorithm Association rule mining is a technique to analyze the  correlations hidden between data. Through mining the association rules between the data sources, the correlations between different attributes of the same record can be found, and dependencies between various attributes that satisfy a certain degree of support and confidence value can be drawn. In the network security systems, correlation analysis can be used to identify the relation between all sorts of intrusive activities of the intruder[6].

Association rules can be described as: Let R = (I1, I2, I3, ... ..., Im) be a set of collection of data items, and W be a group of transaction sets. Each transaction T in W is a  set of data items, and it satisfies RT ? . Suppose there is  a set of data items X, a transaction T, when TX ? , we  say transaction T supports data items set X.

The association rules to be mined refer to a kind of  data implicit rules as follows: X ? Y, in which X, Y are two sets of data items,  ?=??? YXTYTX ,, the support value and credibility that are used to  describe association rules can be defined as?  )()(sup YXPYXport ?=?  )|()( XYPYXconfidence =? Support value is a measurement of the importance of  association rules, for rules of very low support value may only appear occasionally. It also has the nature of expectation and can be used for the effective discovery of association rules. Confidence value is a measurement of the accuracy of the rules. For a given rule X ? Y, the higher the confidence value, the more likely will Y appear  in the affairs containing X. Confidence value also provides Y estimation of probability given X  .The purpose of association analysis is to find the association rules between sets of data items from a known set of transaction W to ensure the degree of their support and confidence greater than the minimum support and the minimum confidence level pre-specified by the user, which is also called the support threshold and confidence threshold.

2) Sequence analysis algorithm Association analysis is used to analyze the horizontal  correlation between various data in the data mining record, while sequence analysis is to find the vertical correlation between different data records. In constructing the intrusion detection model, it is very important to take into account frequent sequential patterns between events, for the series of events generated by the intrusion sometimes are consistent with the normal mode examined individually, and only through the analysis of the relationship between a series of incidents can we determine whether there is invasion. Therefore, the discovery of frequent sequences allows us to know more signatures of the relative system behaviors or user activities.

The goal of sequence analysis is to mine the sequential pattern from the transaction database?the frequent sequences which satisfy the user-specified minimum support requirements, and the sequential pattern must be the highest sequence.

3) Classification algorithm The purpose of data classification is to extract the  signatures of data items in the database to generate classification model, which can map a data item in the database into one of several predefined classes. In intrusion detection, we can classify the intrusions with a variety of criteria into different groups, according to which to analyze past hacking intrusions, and give a description of each group according to the criteria of classification.



IV. DATA MINING BASED INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM  Data mining based intrusion detection system is a detection system established by applying data mining techniques to intrusion detection system[7]. Its system structure is indicated as in Figure 2.

The entire system structure consists of network data acquisition, data pre-processing, test analysis, data mining and rule base. The experimental procedure is as follows:  1) There are too many complicated data on net. It is not suitable to match them with the rules directly. The data should be preprocessed to be formatted to meet the system requirements.

2) Using data mining algorithms to analyze the pre-processed network data, extracting from which the rules of invasion to establish the network intrusion patterns. According to the characteristics of network data, the Apriori algorithm is improved to be Apriori # algorithm, which is used to mine intrusion rules.

3) Through the data detection analysis module, the pre-processed data can be matched with the rules in the rule base to determine whether there is an intrusion. Once the intrusion is detected, the report can be sent to the Response Center, which will decide how to respond to the invasion.



V. CONCLUSION  This paper, based on data mining and intrusion detection, proposes a data-mining based intrusion detection framework, which is the key point of the study.

Of course, it needs further study to improve Apriori algorithm to achieve intelligent intrusion detection.
