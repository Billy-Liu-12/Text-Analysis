A Breast Tumor Classification Method based on  Ultrasound BI-RADS Data Mining

Abstract- In this paper, to reduce the response time of computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) systems, we proposed a  feature selection algorithm that utilizes BI-RADS which is the  standard clinical considerations for radiologists to illustrate the  visual characteristics of breast tumors. We first apply the  association rule mining technique to the medical database  annotated with BI-RADS lexicons by doctors, to find out the  interesting BI-RADS lexicon values. Then, we select the image  processing algorithms which effectively represent the chosen BI?  RADS lexicon values. Finally, the features obtained from the  selected image processing algorithms are used to build our  classifier using Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict  whether each tumor is benign or malignant. Our experimental  result shows that our classifier is accurate with fast execution  time.



I. INTRODUCTION  According to American Cancer Society, it is reported [ 1] that breast cancer is the second leading cause for cancer death in women. It is also reported in [2,3] that early detection and treatment of breast cancers increase significantly the survival rates of breast cancer patients. The ultrasound diagnostic has been utilized widely by radiologists to detect breast cancers early. However, false positive interpretations by radiologists result in many unnecessary biopsies with benign outcomes.

To reduce a high number of unnecessary breast biopsies, several computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) systems [ 12] have been recently developed to assist radiologists in displaying suspicious lesions on medical images by visual analysis and in predicting the malignancy of the lesions by classifying the characteristics of the lesions.

Classification of a breast tumor image in CAD systems is to predict the breast biopsy outcome of its patient, which is either benign or malignant. Such classification tasks consist of three steps [2-7] which are (I) the tumor segmentation, (2) the feature extraction and (3) the tumor classification. In the tumor segmentation step, tumor regions are selected from an original image. In the feature extraction step, feature sets are calculated from the segmented tumor regions by using many image processing algorithms. Finally, in the classification step, by using the extracted feature sets, a classifier predicts whether each tumor in the image is benign or malignant.

The response time of CAD systems is also important as well as their accuracy when radiologists examine patients interactively with CAD systems which requires to produce and process a lot of images that should be classified. The  problem is that a lot of algorithms would be examined in the classification step. If we extract many features to improve the accuracy of classifiers in the step (2), many corresponding algorithms should be executed and the response time may suffer. Fortunately, some features are irrelevant or have redundant information to other features and thus hardly contribute to the performance of classifiers. Identifying and removing such features reduce the dimensionality of the data and may allow classifiers to operate faster and more effectively. Actually we found that the feature subset selection method called CFS in [9] improves the accuracy of classification. However, such a feature subset selection method does not consider the total execution times of processing extraction algorithms to generate the chosen features. In this paper, we focus on how to choose effective feature extraction algorithms to reduce the response time of CAD system.

Since radiologists analyze medical images based on the visual characteristics, the tumor classifiers of CAD systems should be modeled according to the clinical reasoning process by radiologists. The Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS)[ 16] provides the standard clinical considerations for radiologists to illustrate the visual characteristics of breast tumors. As it reduces errors in breast imaging interpretations, it is widely used by radiologists. In BI-RADS for ultrasounds images, there are standardized lexicons for describing the characteristics of a tumor. For example, the shape of a tumor can be represented by a "shape" BI-RADS lexicon and the value of the lexicon can be one of "irregular", "round", "oval" and "lobular". We provide a breast image table annotated with BI-RADS lexicons produced by doctors in Table I.

TABLE T. A BREAST IMAGE TABLE ANNOTATED WITH Bl-RADS LEXICONS  Image Id Shape Margin Orientation Diagnostic  I Irregular Indistinct Not Parallel Malignant 2 Irregular Angular Not Parallel Malignant  3 Round Circumscribed Parallel Benign  4 Round Circumscribed Parallel Benign  Radiologists actually classify the type of a tumor in an ultrasound image as malignant if its shape is irregular. The first and second records in Table I show examples of such diagnoses. In real world, radiologists diagnose the malignancy of each tumor based on not only a single value of BI-RADS    lexicon but also the combinations of several values of BI? RADS lexicons. Thus, in order to build a classifier with good accuracy for breast cancer diagnosis, it would be beneficial to build a classifier using important combinations of BI-RADS lexicons values. Unfortunately, the inputs of CAD systems are not BI-RAD lexicon values but ultrasound images. Thus we should extract suitable features from ultrasound images which describe BI-RAD lexicon values well.

We first apply the association rule mining technique [8] to the medical database annotated with BI-RADS lexicons by doctors, to find out the subset of interesting BI-RADS lexicon values and their combination reflecting the important clinical considerations by doctors for deciding malignancy of breast tumors. We next remove redundant information to get a compact set of BI-RADS lexicon values to be used. Then we select some image processing (feature extraction) algorithms which effectively represent the compact BI-RADS lexicon values from a given set of image processing algorithms.

Finally, the features obtained from the selected image processing algorithms are used to build our classifier using Support Vector Machine (SVM) [I I] to predict whether each tumor is benign or malignant.



II. PRELIMINARY  We introduce the association rule mining technique [8] which will be used to find out the critical BI-RAD lexicons reflecting the clinical considerations by doctors. Consider an example of a breast image table annotated with BI-RADS lexicons produced by doctors in Table I. Let I={iJ, b,oo., im} be the set of items where an item is a pair of a BI-RAD lexicon and its value. For instance, (Shape: Irregular) is an item where "Shape" is a BI-RAD lexicon and "Irregular" is its value. Let 0 be a set of records where each record R is a set of items such that R C I. We say that a record R contains a set  of items X ifxcR.

An association rule has the form of X-7Y, where XCI,  YCI and xnY = cD. In a rule X-7Y, X is called its condition set and Y is the consequence. The rule X -7 Y holds in D with the confidence c if the rule X -7 Y holds in the c % of the records containing X in D. The rule X -7 Y has the support s in D if the rule X -7 Y holds in the s % of the records in D. We refer to the support and confidence of the rule X -7 Y as support (X -7 Y) and confidence (X -7 Y) respectively. For example, supporteR)) and confidence(R)) of the following rule R) from Table I are 50% and 100% respectively.

Rj: (Shape:lrregular)&(Diagnostic:Malignant)-7(Orientation:Not Parallel)  Given a set of records 0, the problem of mining association rules is to produce all association rules whose supports and confidences are at least the user-specified minimum support and minimum confidence respectively. The two classical association rule mining algorithms are the Apriori [8] and FP? growth [ 14].

Among the association rules of the form X -7 Y, we refer to the association rules with Y = (Diagnostic: Malignant) or Y = (Diagnostic: Benign) as diagnostic rules. The rule R2 shown below is an example of a diagnostic rule.

R2:(Shape:lrregular)&(Orientation:Not Parallel)-7 (Diagnostic:Malignant)  Similarly, the problem of mining diagnostic rules is to produce all diagnostic rules satisfying minimum support and minimum confidence thresholds.



III. GENERA nON OF A CLASSIFIER FOR TUMOR DIAGNOSIS  A. Selection of Interesting BI-RAD Lexicon Values  There are many image processing algorithms which generate the features to be used as input for classifiers of breast cancer diagnosis. However, we want to provide only a small number of important features to our classifier as input since invoking image processing algorithms to generate all possible features is very expensive. Thus, we decided to select the features related to the BI-RADS lexicon values which capture the important clinical knowledge used by radiologists.

However, for classification purposes, some of BI-RADS lexicon values may not be useful in the diagnosis of breast cancer. Thus, we next investigate how to find out the critical BI-RADS lexicon values appearing in the diagnostic rules.

We will generate a lot of diagnostic rules by association rule mining and select a small number of diagnostic rules which can capture the important clinical knowledge used by radiologists. When the condition set of a rule ri is a subset of the condition set of another rule rj, we want to keep the rule rj only if the rule rj has a significantly better confidence since it captures more important clinical knowledge than rio  Given a minimum improvement threshold 6 (6)0), we say that a rule rj dominates a rule rj if ( 1) the condition set of rj is a subset of the condition set of rj, and (2) confidence(rj) - confidence(rj) < 6 holds. Given a set of diagnostic rules SD, a compact diagnostic rule set Sc with 6 is a maximal subset of SD where (1) every rule in Sc is not dominated by all other diagnostic rules in Sc and (2) every rule in (SD - Sc) is dominated by a rule in Sc. The goal of generating compact diagnostic rules with 6 is to find distinctive and complementary rules enough to capture doctors' clinical knowledge.

To compute the compact diagnostic rule set with 6 from a set of diagnostic rules SD, a brute-force algorithm may enumerate every possible subset Sc of SD and check whether Sc is a compact diagnosis rule set. However, it takes exponential time and is thus unpractical to be used. Thus, we next develop the greedy algorithm GEN-CDR(SD' 6) which is shown in Figure I.

The GEN-CDR works as follows: A min-heap is built from all diagnostic rules, which satisfy the minimum support and confidence thresholds, using the number of items in the condition set of each diagnostic rule as the key. A min-heap is a complete binary tree [17] such that the rule contained in each node has a smaller number of items in its condition set than the rules in its child nodes. The rule with the minimum number of items in the condition set is placed at the root node in the min-heap. If a pair of rules has the same number of items in their condition sets, the rule with a larger confidence has higher priority in our min-heap.

Procedure GEN-CDR(SD, 8) Input: SD is a set of Diagnostic rules Output: Compact diagnosis rules 8: The minimum improvement threshold PQ: A min-heap for Diagnostic rules.

I: Insert all Diagnostic rules into the PQ 2: RESULT = { } 3: while PQ is not empty do 4: R ?extract-min (PQ) 5: RESULT = RESULT U (R} 6: for each rules S E PQ do 7: if (R dominates S) then 8: Remove S from PQ 9: return RESULT  Figure 1. GEN-CDR(SD, 0)  After the min-heap is built, a rule R with the highest priority is extracted from the min-heap (line4) by invoking the procedure extract-min and is added to RESULT (line5), while the min-heap is not empty. Note that the rule R has the minimum number of items in the condition set and is not dominated by any other rule in the min-heap. We next check whether the rules in the min-heap, which contain the condition set of R, are dominated by the rule R or not. The rules dominated by the rule R are removed from the priority queue (line 8). We guarantee that the rule to be extracted in the next iteration will not be dominated by any other rule in the current RESULT. When the min-heap becomes empty, we return RESULT as a compact diagnostic rule set.

To select the interesting BI-RAD lexicon values from the computed compact diagnostic rules, we first rank compact diagnostic rules based on their confidences and supports. A compact diagnostic rule CORJ is ranked higher than another compact diagnostic rule CORz, iff (I) confidence(CORJ) > confidence(CORz) holds or (2) confidence(CORJ) confIdence(CDRz) and support(CDR1) > support(CDRz) holds.

The top-J compact diagnostic rules, denoted by TopCORj, are the top-J highest ranking compact diagnostic rules. An example of TopCOR3 of compact diagnostic rules generated by GEN-COR in Section liLA is shown in Table [I.

TABLE II AN EXAMPE OF T CDR op' 3 Rule Support Confidence  Shape:irregular -7 Malignant 51.86% 99% EchoPattern:homogeneous & 28.26% 99% Margin:circumscribe -7 Benign  Margin:speculated -7Malignant 16.43% 99%  After TopCDRJ are selected, we compute a set of important BI-RADS lexicon values that is the union of the condition sets of CDRs in TopCDRJ. We refer to the important BI-RADS lexicons and their values as BDVJ.

BDVJ = U CDRE TopCDRJ {v I v E condition set of CDR } For example, the BOY3 of the TopCOR3 in Table II is  {Shape:irregular, Margin :circumscribe, EchoPattern:homogeneous,  Margin:speculated}  B. Selection of Effective Image Processing Algorithms  Intuitively, the features related to BDVJ will improve the accuracy of tumor malignancy classification. Thus, we choose the image processing algorithms with descriptive features for BOYj.

To measure the describability of an image processing algorithm for BOYj, we exploit one of classification techniques such as SYM [11]. Let [PA be an image processing algorithm. We first extract the feature vectors from a given set of images D and represent each image with its extracted feature vector. Then for each BI-RADS lexicon value in BDVJ, we train and test a classifier on D with the existence/absence of the value as the class label. For a classifier C, the describability of [PA to a value v in BOYj , denoted by descc{[PA, v), is defined as  descc(IPA, v) = The ratio of images that are correctly classified as v by the classifier C  Then, the describability of IPA to BDVJ is defmed as the average describability of every value in BDV J.

descc(IPA, BOYj) = avgyE BDV_j (descc{[PA, v))  To use a smaller number of expensive image processing algorithms, we decided to use the above describability.

Furthermore, we remove the B[-RAOS lexicon values from BOYj which do not satisfy a user-defined accuracy threshold for the all [PAs. Then, we simply choose [PAs with K highest describabilities from a set of [PAs and call it the K-effective [PAs represented by E[PAk?  The experimental evaluation show that the classifier trained by the outcomes of EIP Ak has faster execution time and comparable accuracy to a classifier trained by every features created by twenty IP As [7] and selected by traditional feature selection algorithms such as CFS[9].



IV. EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION  To show the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms, we conducted a performance study. All experiments reported in this section were performed on the machine with Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU 2.93GHz and 16GB of main memory running 64 bit Windows operating systems. For our experiments, we use a data set which contains 5,252 images of tumors with biopsy results. In the dataset, 2,745 cases are benign results and 2,507 cases are malignant results. For each tumor region, all B[-RAOS lexicons are annotated by professional medical doctors and a contour line of the region is automatically segmented by our image processing tool.

We utilized WEKA [ 10, 13] to generate diagnostic rules from the BI-RADS lexicons of a data set. We set the minimum support and minimum confidence as 10% and 90% respectively. We also set () used by GEN-CDR as 2%. For the extraction of features from the automatically segmented tumor images, twenty IP As[7] are implemented. The EIP As generated from TopCDR3 in Table II is shown in Table III in the non-increasing order of [PAs' describability.
