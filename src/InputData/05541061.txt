Application of Multidimensional Association Rules in Personal Financial Services

Abstract-To better solve the complexity and diversity in personal financial services, we propose a kind of personal  financial recommendation system based on association rules.

The system makes use of the customers' financial information  to generate data cube, and then generates the recommendation  set by multi-dimensional association rule mining. We also  propose the concept of recommendation weight and use it for  recommending process. As a result of the introduction of  multidimensional association rules and the recommendation  weight, the recommendations of new service and import  service are reasonably managed. This recommendation system is more intelligent, efficient and personalized in solving the  complexity and diversity in customizing financial service  effectively.

I. INTRODUCTION  Each time a bank account is requested, the bank accounting system drops a line on the access log. The access log is basically a relation (or table) with a few columns that records what is regarded as important information about personal financial services. These data can then be mined for different purposes.

Data mining can be known as a knowledge discovery process in databases [1]. Database mining is the automated process of extracting interesting and previously unknown patterns and correlations from large databases. Association rule mining is the process of discovering items, which tend to occur together in transactions based on some kind of rules [2-5]. With the rapid development of knowledge discovery technologies, data warehouse and association rule mining are applied to recommendation system gradually [6].

The recommendation system is more and more important.

Many commerce webs have introduced the personalized recommendation system. Very little work has been done in mmmg association rules in personal financial recommendation. The customers can not understand many financial products in the short period of time and are difficult to judge whether the products are right for them. Therefore, customers need an assistant that can recommend financial products to the customers according to customers own interests or satisfactory.

In this paper we presented recommendation system based on multidimensional association rules for personal financial services. The system makes use of customer registered  Huijie Li Communications and Technology department  linan Municipal Public Security Bureau linan, China  Li? huijie@126.com  information and customer consumption to generate recommendation set by multidimensional association rules mining. The system provides distinct financial plans for various customers, thus improves the personalization of the recommendation.



II. MULTIDIMENSIONAL ASSOCIA nON RULES RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM STRUCTURE  A. the description of Personalized Recommendation System  Personalized recommendation is that the bank department recommended the information and financial products, in which the customers are interested according to the customers interests' characteristics and users' financial service history [7, 8]. With the incomes higher and financial product type fast-growing, customers need to spend a lot of time to find a suitable product. This process of browsing a lot of irrelevant information and product will undoubtedly loss consumers who are drowned in the problem of information overload. Personalized recommendation system is an advanced business intelligence platform based on massive data mining and assists bank department providing completely personalized decision support and information services for their customers' financing. Personal financial management recommendation system would recommend financial products to customers, auto-complete the process of individual selecting financial products and meet customer's individual requirements.

Recommendation process is based on the following factors.

? Customers job type ? Customer age ? Customers' history financial products ? The characteristics of financial products  B. Recommendation System Structure  The whole recommendation system includes data transfer, data cube generating, multi-dimensional association rule mining, recommendation set generating and filtering. The system recommendation structure is shown as Fig. I.

The data about customers and financial products are probably saved in several databases or relational tables. After the data sources are cleaned and transferred, they loaded into data warehouse. Data cube effectively integrates the customer registration, historical data and location      information by multidimensional data model. Frequent predicate sets are mined using improved Apriori? Cube algorithm. Multidimensional association rules are generated from frequent predicate sets. According to the customer registration information and historical information, the types of financial products that customers may need are generated.

Appropriate financial products are generated to customers using recommendation degree.

III. KEY TECHNOLOGIES IN THE RECOMMENOA nON SYSTEM'S IMPLEMENTATION  A. Data Cube Generation  The data cube is used to represent data along some measure of interest. Although called a "cube", it can be 2- dimensional, 3-dimensional, or higher-dimensional. Each dimension represents some attribute in the database and the cells in the data cube represent the measure of interest. For example, they could contain a count for the number of times that attribute combination occurs in the database, or the minimum, maximum, sum or average value of some attribute.

In data warehouse, data are organized in the form of the data cube by multidimensional data model. Data cube defined by the dimension and fact. Dimension is the point of data observation. Dimension is related to the property, but the fact is a specific data. From the point of specific data view (dimension), there are several descriptions that is called dimension level. The fact table contains the keywords relevant with dimension table and the measurement of the fact [9].

According to the mining task given by the user, the data cube is generated from the data warehouse. Association rules mining could be carried out in data cube. As a result of total or partly materialization storage of data cube in data warehouse beforehand, a lot of association rules mining time is saved and the efficiency of mining is improve obviously.

For a given task of association rules' mining whose content involves dI . . .  dn dimension, the dimension levels of various dimensions are determined according to users'  mining requirements and then data cube is generated from data warehouse. In data cube, every dimension includes Idil+ 1 numbers. The value of Idil is the number of different dimension members which are in i dimension. In the di dimension, prior Idil rows stand for different dimension member in di dimension respectively. The last row sores the dimension member called SUM. The total of corresponding dimension is recorded in the last row. This existence of total is convenient to support degree computation of association rules significantly. The frequency of corresponding dimension is recorded as count in the grid of data cube. So a task for association rules mining that involves dl. . .  dn dimension corresponds to a n-dimension data cube (dI . . .  dn I count). In data cube (dI. . .  dn I count), dI. . .  dn is the dimension of data cube and count is the fact value of data cube.

In personal financial services database there are several dimensions such as income type (1-T), investment direction (I-D), currency type (C-T), job (1) and age. Age is discretized as LA (18-30), MA (31-50) and HA (51-80).

Table 2 shows the various customers' financial services data cube information. I-Tn, I-Dn and C-Tn note the special financial product of certain customer. For example, when customer base's job is JI and age is MA, they select I-TI, 1- D2 and C-T3. Table I shows personal financial services data cube.

TABLE I PERSONAL FINANCIAL SERVICES DATA CUBE  Income Investment Cnrrency Job Age Type Direction Type  I-Tl I-DI C-T3 Jl MA  I-Tl 1-02 C-T4 JI MA  I-TI 1-02 C-T6 J2 MA  I-T2 I-D3 C-TI J3 LA  I-T2 1-04 C-TI J5 HA  I-T3 1-02 C-T4 J2 MA  I-T3 1-04 C-T2 J5 HA  ... ... ... ... ...

B. Multidimensional A ssociation Rules Mining  In data mining, association rule learning is a popular and well researched method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases. For example, the rule {onions, potatoes} => {beef} found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, he or she is likely to also buy beef [1 0, 11].

Association rules identifY collections of data attributes that are statistically related in the underlying data. An association rule is of the form X => Y where X and Y are  V5-501 Volume 5    20 I 0 International Coriference On Computer Design And Appliations (ICCDA 2010)  disjoint conjunctions of attribute-value pairs. The confidence of the rule is the conditional probability of Y given X, Pr(YIX), and the support of the rule is the prior probability of X and Y, Pr(X and Y). Here probability is taken to be the observed frequency in the data set. The traditional association rule mining problem can be described as follows.

Given a database of transactions, a minimal confidence threshold and a minimal support threshold, find all association rules whose confidence and support are above the corresponding thresholds.

According to the number of dimensions, association rule could be divided two classes: single dimension association rule and multi dimension association rule. Single dimension association rule only involves one attribute data. Multi dimension association rule could process multi attribute data.

Multidimensional association rule includes two or more predicate; for instance, Age (X. "30?35") /\ Occupation(X, "teacher") =>buys(X, "educational savings").

Multidimensional association mmmg from data warehouse has become a knowledge discovery paradigm because it provides more specific conditional settings for target mining data, thus can generate rules more close to users' needs [12, l3].

In the multi-dimensional association rule mining algorithm, this system uses improved Apriori _Cube algorithm. The improved algorithm is more able to meet the actual needs. In the certain hierarchy dimension the strong association rules may not be mined sometimes, so it is necessary to drill up or drill down the data cube in the mining process. After the dimension hierarchy is adjusted, it is suitable for mining.

The recommendation weight is larger, the recommendation degree is larger. We can increase the recommendation weight in order to emphasize the financial product. For new financial products or important financial products we can allocate a bigger recommendation weight to achieve preferential recommendation. The default of /1 is I. It can be modify by consumers.

We can multiply the recommendation weight and the confidence of every financial product to get the recommendation degree RD: RD=/1 *Cr.

D. Recommendation Algorithm  In accordance with the frequent predicate sets generated by improved Apriori_ Cube algorithm, we could find all association rules set ARS that satisfied the minimum support and minimum confidence. After then, we can find all association rule sets that are supported by consume, that is, all the products in the left of association rule were selected by consumer. In accordance with consumer's job and age, we could find all the products P that are not selected by consumer but are predicted by ARS. At last, we sort the products in P according to the confidence in ARS and the recommendation weight of financial product.

Product recommendation algorithm is as the following: Input: product list II selected by consumer  N IIMaximum of recommendation products Output: Recommendation products list (1) Call CreateProductList function Ilgenerate  recommendation products list; (2) If the number of recommendation product>  Maximum of recommendation N (3) select prior N product for recommendation; (4) else if he number of recommendation product>O (5) select all products in recommendation list for  recommendation; (6) else (7) Reduce the number of products selected by  consume and Call CreateProductList function until the recommendation financial product is null or the financial product selected by consumer is null.

(8) Multiply the recommendation weight /1 and the confidence Cr of financial product in ARS.

(9) Sort the recommendation financial products by the recommendation degree RD.



IV. EXPERIMENTS AND ANALYSIS  Recommendation system based on multidimensional association rule full considers the job, age and istory financial services of the consumer to provide the personalized method. The following is an example. By improved Apriori_ Cube algorithm we get frequent 5- predicate set as shown in Table II.

V5-502 Volume 5     TABLE II. FREQUENT 5-PREDICA TE SET  We can set minimum confidence to 80%. The following are association rules by L5.

I-T2, 1-02, 11, MA => C-Tl confidence=83% 1- Frequent 5-predicate Set L5 T2, 1-03,  J2 , MA => C- T2 {I-TL I-DL C-T3, JI, MA}  {1-T6, I-D5, C-Tl, J2, MA} {1-T2, 1-02, C-T3, ]3, HA} {1-T3, I-D2, C-TI, J2, MA} {I-TL I-D5, C-T3, ]3, LA}  confidence=86% I-T2, 1-02, J2, HA => C-T3 confidence=82% If consumer A and B have selected financial product 1-  T2, 1-02, we can recommend consumer A product C-Tl in accordance with his job (11) and age (MA), but recommend consumer B product C-T3 in accordance with his job (12) and age (HA).

We can seen from the above example that the financial products recommended by income type (I-T), investment direction (I-D), currency type (C-T), job (1) and age dimensions are accurate and can meet the customer's financial features.



V. CONCLUSIONS  In this paper, we designed a novel and efficient personal financial services system based on multidimensional association rules and proposed the concept Jl as recommendation weight. This system can provide more exact effective recommendation products in accordance with customer own characteristics. The system makes use of registered information and history financial products information of customer to generate recommendation set by multidimensional association rules mining. The recommendation weight contributes to preferential recommendation and can emphasize new and import financial services.

This paper only discussed the positive association rules mining from multi dimensions. Negative association rule is another aspect of data mining and different from positive association rules. In future work, we will discuss the effect of negative multidimensional association rules in personalized recommendation.
