Discovering Purchasing Pattern of Sport Items Using Market Basket Analysis   Wan Faezah Abbas, Nor Diana Ahmad, Nurlina Binti Zaini

Abstract ? One of the oldest problem in data mining is the market basket problem, the search for meaningful associations in customer purchase data. Currently, the Sport Company has an issue on sport items arrangement in accordance with customer purchasing pattern. They noticed that, the sales of certain products become decrease when they made some arrangement to the shelves. The Sport Company do not have any available computerized mechanism to provide the best arrangement of item store at the retail store. Everything is done manually by the owner of the shop according their own style. This study intends to identify purchasing pattern of sport items by adopting data mining technique which is Market Basket Analysis. This data mining pattern will help the retailer to make a better arrangement of the products at the premise. Historical data is analyzed to identify associated items from purchasing data of customer that involved sales data, items data and order data. As a result from this research, the sports items will be arranged according to the best rules identified and propose a new pattern.

I.  INTRODUCTION Data mining techniques have been widely  implemented by numerous organizations in the field of business that shown the great success and lucrative outcomes. Although data mining has been widely and successfully used in the domain of business operations, data mining is still in its infancy [1].

The sports industry has generally been a poor and light user of data mining [2]. However, in [3] pointed out that data mining will become a critical component of selling and marketing sports teams. Similarly, the concept of data mining will become main stream in sports as an effective complementary marketing tool in the future [4]. Market basket analysis also known as association rule mining is one of the data mining methods [5] focusing on discovering purchasing patterns by extracting associations or co-occurrences from a store?s transactional data.

The basic form of association rules is based upon the assumption that if a customer purchases a certain set of items from a store, he or she is more (or less) likely to purchase another set of items. Based on this, our study concentrates on the mining purchasing pattern of sport items in a Sport Company using Apriori algorithm.

Currently, the Sport Company has an issue on sport items arrangement in accordance with customer purchasing pattern. They noticed that, the sales of certain products  become decrease when they made some arrangement to the shelves. These arrangements made by the retailer contribute to the decreasing number of sales.

The availability of a purchasing pattern can help the retailer in monitoring buying patterns and improve customer satisfaction [6] and able to find out recurring patterns in order to offer related goods together and therefore increase their sales. Hence, we propose a purchasing pattern at the Sport Company to be able to find out recurring patterns in order to help increase their sales.



II. LITERATURE A. Data Mining Data mining or sometimes known as knowledge discovery can be defined in several ways. Hand [7] defined data mining as the analysis of (often large) observational data sets to find unsuspected relationships and to summarize the data in novel ways that are both understandable and useful to the data owner. It is also being defined as a process of non-trivial extraction of implicit, previously unknown and potentially useful information from the data stored in a database [8].

Another researcher, [6] defined data mining as the process of extracting non trivial, implicit, previously unknown and potentially useful information from large database, data warehouse and XML repository. Technically, data mining is the process of finding correlations or pattern among dozens of fields in large relational databases and distributes result that can be used in an automated decision support system. The objective of data mining is to extract useful knowledge from a volume of data.  The discovered knowledge has been used in a wide array of applications such as market analysis, fraud detection, customer relationship management and other business decision making process [9].

B. Knowledge Discovery Database (KDD)  The term Knowledge Discovery (KDD) is referring to the overall process of discovering useful knowledge from data. Data mining is a particular step in the KDD process where application of specific algorithms for extracting patterns from data. The Knowledge Discovery in Database process which is interactive and iterative involving numerous steps. Figure 1 shows data mining as a step in interactive and iterative knowledge discovery process.

Data Mining Model and Task  From all the research mentioned above, it can be seen that data mining have been applied in several ways to perform various tasks. Through the use of various data mining tasks, it is believed that varieties of problems can be solved. The task of data mining can be illustrated as Figure 2 below:     Figure 2: Data mining models and task  (Source: Dunham, 2003) [11]   Based on the Figure 2, data mining tasks can be classified into predictive or descriptive in nature.

Descriptive mining is the process of drawing the essential characteristics or general properties of the data in the database. Meanwhile, a predictive mining is to perform inference on current data, to make predictions based on the historical data [12]. Unlike the predictive mining, descriptive mining serves as a way to explore the properties of the data examined and not to predict new properties. In this research the data mining task being explored is the descriptive model. According to Marco & Gianluca [13], descriptive method can be defined to discover interesting regularities in the data, to uncover patterns and find interesting subgroups in the bulk of data.

There are four approaches of descriptive data mining:  clustering, summarization, association rules and sequence analysis.

i. Clustering  Zhang [14] stated that clustering is the process of grouping similar data together. Each group which is called as cluster consists of objects that are similar among themselves and dissimilar to objects of other groups. Data modeling puts clustering in a historical perspective rooted in mathematics, statistics and numerical analysis. From a machine learning perspective clusters correspond to hidden pattern. It is known as unsupervised learning from the machine learning perspective and the output represents a data concept.

ii. Summarization Summarization map data into subsets with associated simple descriptions [11]. In summarization, it will measure central tendency that consists of mean, median, mode and midrange.

It also measures on data dispersion that involves quartile, inter quartile range and variety.

iii. Association rule Association rules are used to discover interesting associations between attributes contained in a database. It aims is extracting important correlation among the data items in the databases.

Basically, association rule extracts the patterns from the database based on the two measures which are minimum support and minimum confidence. Additionally, this research is supported by [15] who also imply that it is a popular technique for market basket analysis because all possible combinations of potentially interesting product groupings can be explored.

iv. Sequence analysis Sequence analysis is the same as association, except that the time sequence of events is also considered.

Out of these, association rule mining is popular and well researched data mining technique for discovering interestingness relations between variables in large database [16].

D. Associate Rule Mining  This research concentrates on association rule mining as the study aims to identify associated items (patterns) from purchasing data of the customer. The purpose is to discover the concurrence associations among data in large databases, and to discover interesting associations between attributes contained in a database. An association rule is an implication or if-then-rule which is supported by data. The motivation given for the development of association rules is market basket analysis which deals     with the contents of point-of-sale transaction of large retailers [17].

Association rule mining (ARM) is being introduced by Agrawal [18]. ARM is used widely in marketing and retail communities in addition to many other diverse fields. This technique is also being referred as Market Basket Analysis (MBA). Technically, association rule concept is looking for a relationship between items with other items. Stated by Ping & Chou [19] to develop association rules, one examines the frequency with which a customer buys item B if that customer has also purchased item A. In that case, item A is the antecedent (condition) while item B is the consequent (result). To determine the Association?s rules, it needs to be specified the support and confidence to restrict whether the rule is interesting or not [6].

Support is expressed as a percentage, representing the probability that a randomly selected set of transactions from a database include items A and B. Expressed mathematically; the formula can be simplified as below:   Support (A        B) = P (A ? B)   To increase efficiency of calculation, MBA prunes support below a certain threshold usually at 5 percent [20]. Confidence also expressed as a percentage, is the probability that a randomly selected set of transaction will include B given that they include A. Expressed mathematically, the formula can be simplified as below:   Confidence (A        B) = P (B|A)   Rules are reported as association rules if their confidence reaches or exceeds a given lower limit (minimum confidence). It means, look for the rules that have a high probability of being true. The default value of minimum confidence is 80 percent.

The goal of standard ARM is to output all rules whose support and confidence are respectively above some given support and coverage thresholds. These rules encapsulate the relational associations between selected attributes in the database, for instance, coke implies potato chips: 0.02 support; 0.70 coverage denote that in the database, 70% of the people who buy coke also buy potato chips, and these buyers constitute 2% of the database. This rule signifies a positive (directional) relationship between buyers of coke and potato chips [21].  ARM finds out association rules that satisfy the pre-defined minimum support and confidence from a given database. ARM has two-step process [6]:  ? Frequent Item set Generation: generate all set of items that have support greater than a certain threshold, called min support.

? Association Rule Generation: from the frequent item set, generate all association rules that have  confidence greater than a certain threshold called min confidence.

The main problem of association rule is that there are so many possible rules. For example, for the product range of a supermarket, which may consist of several thousand different products, there are billions of possible association rules. It is obvious that such a vast amount of rules cannot be processed by inspecting each one in turn.

Therefore efficient algorithms are needed that restrict the search space and check only a subset of all rules. One such algorithm is Apriori algorithm which was developed by Agrawal [18].

E. Market Basket Analysis  MBA has been applied in such areas as cross-selling, decision support, customer behavior analysis, and customer relationship management [22]. Based on data mining, it is aimed at discovering customer purchase patterns by determining associations from point-of-sale (POS) transaction data [9][5]. The item association information thus developed can be applied in such marketing activities as catalog design, product placement, promotion and cross-selling [23].

In analyzing MBA association rules, one must discern between the following three types of rules [24]:  ? Actionable rules, which provide understandable and high-quality information and suggest effective promotions. For example is the unlikely combination of beer and diapers.

? Trivial rules, which amount to common sense or may reflect past marketing or product bundling.

For example, if paint, then brush.

? Inexplicable rules, which seem coincidental have no explanation and do not suggest a course of action.

To explain the concept of MBA, consider example in Figure 3 below:  Figure 3: Co-Occurrence of Products (Source:[19])   MBA rules, a list of five simple grocery transactions  and the resulting co-occurrences is given below:   Transaction 1: Rice, beef, bread Transaction 2: Beef, potato chips Transaction 3: Rice, bread Transaction 4: Beef, milk Transaction 5: Bread, milk       Two of the five transactions include both rice and bread, giving a 40 percent support measure for the association rule ?rice implies bread.? The confidence in the rule ?rice implies bread? is 100 percent, as two out of two transactions that include rice also contain bread. Rice and bread are more likely to be purchased together than any other two items and rice is never purchased with potato chips or milk. This analysis suggests placing rice and bread close to each other for cross-selling.

Market Basket Analysis has been intensively used in many organizations as a means to discover product associations and base a retailer?s promotion strategy on them. Any sport companies can have a lot of benefits, such as making decision on which product should have a promotion, the segmentation of customers, and the identify the relationships among product items by using MBA technique. For example, in LimitedBrands, a family of different fashion brands, the outcome of an extensive market basket analysis was the following [25]:  ? When different additional brands are sold together with the basic brands, the revenue from the basic brands is not decreasing, but increasing.

? ?Buy two, get three? sales promotion campaigns are very successful, if market basket analysis are used in order to determine the right products to be promoted.

? Based on market basket analysis, sets of product are defined and sold together with discount.

Other than the research above, MBA also gives the retailer the best information about related sales on group of good basis. One research done have stated that majority of kitchen appliances groups are related at Merkur Company. Customers who buy a kitchen appliance often also buy several other kitchen appliances. It makes sense that these groups are placed side by side in a retail centre so that the customer can access them quickly.

Such related groups of goods also must be located side-by-side in order to remind customers of related items and to lead them through the centre in a logical manner [26]. According to [27], MBA represent one segment of tools for decision making considering placement of goods. It can be shown where the retailers should change the placement of goods so that the business effects of the change can be measured.

According to [28], in order to search for frequent item sets, there is an algorithm for association rule mining. It is called as Apriori algorithm. Apriori algorithm will identify the items that often appear in the database and the pair of items in one transaction. Pair of items that exceed the minimum support will be included into the frequent item sets are selected. Frequent item sets that exceed the minimum support will generate association rules after decoding.

One frequent item sets can generate association rules and find the confidence. The test result will show the  information on what kinds of product are frequently bought at the same time by the customers. This information will give additional consideration for retailers of any sport boutique to make the further decision in arrangement of products at retail store.

F. Apriori Algorithm  Apriori algorithm is a popular data mining techniques which are being proposed by Agrawal et.al in 1994. It is the best known algorithm for mining association rules from transactional databases [9]. The basic idea of the Apriori algorithm is to generate candidate item sets of a particular size and then scan the database to count these to see if they are large [11]. A candidate item sets includes the items that have the possibility to be a member of the frequent item sets. It then discovers the frequent item sets from the candidate item sets [29]. It is more efficient during the candidate generation process for two reasons; Apriori employs a different candidate?s generation method and a new pruning technique.

There are many applications that use Apriori algorithm to get the related rules between data in large databases. One of the applications proposed is a new algorithm name Multipass with Inverted Hashing & Pruning (MIHP) for mining algorithms, the Apriori algorithm and the Direct Hashing and Pruning (DHP) algorithm have been used to evaluate the context of text databases. The result showed that Apriori rules gave better results for smaller text databases [30].

Apriori algorithm uses a technology called ?floor by floor search for the iterative method,? of which the basic idea is to use recursive layer by layer approach. First, scan the database, resulting in frequent item sets; and then Apriori-gen makes use of the connection of the members of Lk-1 to produce candidates for frequent item sets Ck especially after the members? being pruned. The supported numbers of each candidate frequent item sets thereby can be calculated by scanning the transaction database.



III. METHODOLOGY The research methodology is an important part and act  as a guideline for researcher in developing the project. It consists of several steps that will be used in the project.

This methodology has a purpose to ensure the progress of the project and commit to the project timeline. Thus, the project adopts the data mining technique. There are a few approaches that will be implemented in order to meet the research objectives. It consists of four phases that start with the problem identification and planning, knowledge acquisition, knowledge analysis and pattern interpretation.

i. Problem Identification and Planning  In this phase, there are three activities involved which are preliminary interview with the staff (manager and retailer) of sports company, develop questionnaire and find related journal that can solve the problem faced     by the organization. Preliminary interview was needed by the researcher to identify and to have more understanding towards the potential problems that being faced by the organization in order to minimize the problem that occurs before. A questionnaire was developed to get a feedback from customers on their opinion about the current arrangement of sport items at the premise. In every research, an authority material was used so that the problem can be solved and the result of the research was valid. In this research, data mining technique that focused on Market Basket Analysis was used to minimize the organization?s problem.

ii. Knowledge Acquisition Knowledge acquisition is the process of extracting, structuring and organizes knowledge from one source, usually human experts so it can be used in the software. Knowledge was obtained from an interview session with the staff (manager and retailer) in the sport company and also a historical data from organization?s database. Historical data included were sales data, items data and transaction data. Activities and tasks involve in knowledge acquisition are having an interview session with the staff, distribute questionnaire to the customers who visit the store and complete the literature reviews on data mining technique. In order to gather the relevant information, there is a need for data collection and manipulation.

Knowledge gained from interview session and questionnaire data was used to support research problem and to identify the current arrangement of sport items at the premise and increase the sales of the sports company. The historical data taken before were used to discover the best association between items at the knowledge analysis phase.

iii. Knowledge Analysis The purpose of the knowledge analysis was to analyze  the arrangement of sport items at retail store using Market Basket Analysis which based on raw data gathering at the earlier stage. The raw data includes interview results, questionnaire feedback from the respondents and historical data from organization?s database. All the data need to be analyzed in order to understand on how the Market Basket Analysis would help in manipulating and evaluating pattern based on customer preferences by studying the trends of customer purchasing pattern at the sport company.



IV. RESULTS AND FINDINGS Based upon 300 transactions of sport items purchased  by the customer at the Sports Company, we identified 24 attributes and the list of sport items related. The results of Apriori algorithm are explained below:  ? Apriori generated the sets of large item sets found for each support size considered. In this case, there are four size of set of large item sets. The first sets  of large item sets involved 14 different of sport items. The second set of large item sets involved 35 sport items. The third set of large item sets involved 17 sport items and the fourth set of large item sets involved 4 sport items which are short, sock, shin guard and boot.

? By default, Apriori tries to generate ten rules. It begins with a minimum support of 100% of the data items and decrease this in step of 5% until there are at least ten rules with the required minimum confidence or until the support has reached a lower bound of 10% whichever occur first. The minimum confidence is set 0.8. The minimum support decreased to 0.9 (90%), before the required number of rules can be generated.

Generation of the required number of rules involved a total of two iterations.

? The last part of the results is the list of ten best rules identified by using an Apriori algorithm. For example, based on the rule number one, if purchase jersey, they will also purchase socks.

Following the rule is the number of those items for which the rule?s consequent holds as well. In the parentheses there is a confidence of rules which is 1 (100%). Ten best rules is being simplified by the table below according to the value of confident between sport items:  TABLE I.  RULE BASED ON SUPPORT AND CONFIDENCE  Rule No.

If Antecedent, Support then Consequent  Confidence  1. If buy jersey, then buy sock 1.00 2. If buy shoe, then buy sock 0.99 3. If buy shoe and shin guard, then  buy sock 0.99  4. If buy sling bag, then buy sock 0.99 5. If buy racket and shoe, then buy  sock.

0.99  6. If buy short and shoe, then buy sock  0.99  7. If buy shoe and boot, then buy sock  0.99  8. If buy shin guard, then buy sock 0.99 9. If buy short, then buy sock 0.99 10 If buy boot, then buy sock 0.99  Table 1 shows when a customer purchased jersey,  there is a possibility that most likely they will purchase sock. This is referring to the high value of confidence of jersey and sock will be purchased together which is 1(100%). Other than that, if the customer purchased shoe or as well as shin guard, they are also going to purchase sock. Same goes with short, boot, sling back and racket.

Based on the 10 rules above, there are high possibilities that the customers, who purchased sock, they are also purchasing either shoe, boot, shin guard, short, jersey and sling back in their shopping basket. Figure 4 show the     generated rules based on support and confidence level of sport items.

Figure 4.  Generated rules based on support and confidence  As a conclusion, a pattern is proposed based on the best rules identified using Apriori algorithm which is referring to the support and confidence between sport items. The sport items arrangement will be based on the highest percentage association of sport items purchased by customer.



V. CONCLUSION The rules show what the latent relationship between  sports items purchased was and the best arrangement between items that can be placed side by side or in a same retail area so that the sport items can be frequently sold together and yield the sales of the company.  These rules are a pattern in arranging the sport items at the Sport Company retail store.

This study can be a reference tool to any sports boutique company in arranging the sport items at their premise. The pattern helps attract customers? attention by locating the items side-by-side in order to remind customer of related items and this purchasing pattern can increase the sales of the company.
