The Interpretive Flexibility of an E-government Project: From an Actor- Network Theory Perspective

Abstract This paper draws upon concepts from the actor-  network theory (ANT) to interpret the sequence of events that lead to the interpretive flexibility of information systems implementation in a municipal administration in Shanghai, China. Through our intensive examination of the process of development and implementation of the e-government project, we find that interpretive flexibility of the information system is highly determined by the heterogeneous interests inscribed in the technology. We propose that the heterogeneous interests reach a settlement through a phased translation process. By investigating the translation of the actor-network, the paper demonstrates the process by which the interpretive flexibility of the IT project comes into being. While great amount of studies on interpretive flexibility are focusing on mental sides of human agents, the research sheds lights on uncovering the interpretive flexibility from inscribed interests perspective.

1. Introduction   According to the World Bank, e-government refers to the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) to facilitate or transform government performance, e.g. better delivery of government services to citizens, improved interactions with business and industry, citizen empowerment through access to information, or more efficient government management. E-government projects take a variety of forms under different circumstances. Due to discrepancies in conditions of national information infrastructure, network economy, and socio-cultural conditions, developing countries tend to adopt different e-government strategies from developed countries [1].

E-government projects in China generally aim to deliver government services to citizens, strengthen linkage between the government and the industry and  citizens, and to improve the transparency and efficiency of government administration by networking government departments [2]. China started e- government activities in the early 1990s, when it was required that all government offices should set up websites to provide information to citizens. In 1993, three ?Golden? projects were launched as pilot e- government projects: the Golden Bridge (transportation) project, the Golden Card (banking) project and the Golden Custom project. These were followed by more than a dozen other ?Golden projects?, which aim to construct and integrate a nation-wide e-government infrastructure in China [3].

However, e-government projects still face tremendous challenges.  In 2003, United Nations pointed out in its e-government report that the e- government project failure rate is very high, at round 60-80% [4]. The greatest challenge probably lies with the transition from government to e-government [5].

Similarly, in China, it is unclear whether the e- government initiatives really achieve their goals. So far, most studies on e-government in China focus on government websites [3, 5, 6]. This paper presents a case of municipal e-government project in China, which ?drifted? from a cross-departmental integrated system that aims to promote transparency and accountability to an isolated departmental system to improve operational efficiency. Yet, this project was viewed as a ?success?. The process of drifting reflects the interpretive flexibility of the information system.

We argue that such interpretive flexibility is a result of the creation and transformation of an actor-network in which different interests of different stakeholders are inscribed and translated.

The interpretive flexibility of information technologies, referring to the ?capacity of a specific technology (or other knowledge system) to sustain the divergent interpretations of multiple groups? [7, p.

260], has been widely investigated in information systems research [8-10]. However, to our knowledge,      no research has investigated the determinants of the degree of the flexibility in the information technology design and implementation. We have no knowledge on how flexible can an information technology be. This paper draws upon concepts from actor-network theory to investigate the process of how flexibility comes into being in an e-government project.

The paper is organized as follows. First, we present the conceptual framework; actor-network theory and the concept of interpretive flexibility are discussed in this section. Next, we present the case background and describe the research method, with detail on the data collection. In the penultimate section of the paper, we make an intensive analysis and discussion on the case from the actor-network theory. Finally, we draw conclusions on the theoretical and practical implications of our paper.

2. Conceptual Framework  2.1. Actor-Network Theory   Rooted in studying relations between society and  science, actor-network theory (ANT) developed into a approach to analyze situations in which social and technical factors are blended into complex settings [11, 12]. Main point of ANT is not to a priori separate complex socio-technical situation into its social and its technical components, rather analyze the interplay between both with ANT concepts. Actually, ANT makes no difference between human and non-human entities. All the entities are generalized symmetry [12].

In addition, ANT assumes that every actor needs an alliance of other actors to reach its goals. These alliances can comprise of very heterogeneous actors and interests. Understanding the dynamics of such actor-networks is the focus of ANT.

Key concepts in ANT are act-network, translation and inscription. ANT recognizes that establishing and changing a social order relies on a tight interplay between social and technical factors. Human and non- humans are allied as actor networks. Further, ANT assumes that (a section of) society is inhabited by actors pursuing interests. An actor?s interests can be translated into technical or social arrangements, for instance an information systems or organizational routines. There are four stages in the translation process: problematization, interessement, enrollment and mobilization [12], In problematization, the initiator seeks to become indispensable to other actor in a specific setting by define the nature and the problems of the latter and then suggesting that these would be resolved if the actors participate the project [12]. In interessement, by convincing other actors that the project is aligned with their own interests, the initiator  seeks to lock the other actors into the roles that had been proposed for them. In enrollment, the actor seeks to define and interrelate the various roles it had allocated to others. The last moment is mobilization, which includes the initiators? use of a set of strategies to ensure the alliance act according to the agreement and not betray. The end result of the translation is the stability after reaching a certain degree of alignment of interests [11]. An inscription is the result of the translation of one?s interest into material artifacts or routines [11, p.143]. Actors inscribe their interests into technical artifacts in ways that defines the role and use of these artifacts [13].

ANT can serve as a useful theoretical lens for understanding sociopolitical phenomena such as information technology design and implementation.

Specially, we believe that ANT can provide added explanatory power in three primary ways. First, ANT does not a priori exclude non-human actors from the analysis, thereby allowing for a more explicit examination of the information technologies in a socio- technical process. Second, ANT does not a priori distinguish between individuals and organizations [14].

This allows the research to focus on the connections between different actors and provides a hybrid view on the technology implementation [15-17]. Third, ANT assumes that society is inhabited by actors pursuing interests.  Interests can be translated into technical or social arrangement, for instance an information systems or organizational routines. The interests inscribed in the information technologies provide us with insights about the complex social-technical events during the implementation.

2.2. Interpretive flexibility of information technology   Interpretive flexibility has been the focus of  discussions on the relationships between human, technology and organization. Initial researches were focused around Giddens? structuration theory [18], while more recently actor-network theory [19] has attracted increasing attention.

From structuration theory, the social constructionists argue that a given technology has interpretive flexibility [20], which allows for different interpretations of its functional and social-cultural properties. Technology is hence socially constructed such that perceptions of its properties are largely determined by the interpretive frameworks and negotiations of relevant social groups. ?Stabilization? of the flexibility occurs when different social groups arrive at a similar interpretation of a technology [21].

The agency relates exclusively to human actors [18].

Technical artifacts, their enduring materiality      notwithstanding, are simply ?allocative resources?, are flexible only when the involved agencies interpret them in different ways.

Taking generalized symmetry as one of its principles, ANT [14, 19] takes no differences between human and non-human actors. According to ANT, interpretive flexibility is the ability of a technical artifact to represent ?different things to different actors? [22, p.24]. When new technologies are developed and implemented, their inherent ?interpretive flexibility? will allow various stakeholders to associate different meanings to the artifact [23]. Over a period of time, as stakeholders identify problems with the new artifact, modifications are introduced and meanings get embedded into the design and implementation of the artifact, until all problems have been resolved, and state of ?closure? is reached [21, p.46]. Where there are significant differences of interpretation between the stakeholders, Bijker [21] suggests that a state of closure will only be reached in the following two ways: embedding the meaning of the most dominant group of stakeholders; enrolling stakeholders to compromise or consensus position, or proceeding with more than one design.

The closure results from the stabilization of an artifact. Stability is continually negotiated as a social process of aligning heterogeneous interests via inscription and translation [9]. Therefore, within a relevant social group, opinion is mobilized by various means and successful networks of aligned interests are created by enrolling a sufficient body of allies [24].

From the ANT perspective, we can state that interpretive flexibility is amenable to social shaping  through the alignment of heterogeneous interests into one coherent ?network? [9].

3. Case Introduction and Research Methodology  The case we report here concerns the design and implementation of an e-government system in Shanghai municipal real estate administration. The project, named FDMIS started in June 2003. The project team includes over ten related department, a consultant agency and the municipal government. The core team members are Department X, which is in charge of the municipal computerization, Agency I, a prior affiliation of Department X, Department F, the department which is mainly in charge of the real estate transactions. At the beginning, Agency I makes a quick win by successful implementation of a land transaction subsystem in December 2003. However, the cross- departmental operations are not covered in this subsystem. Inspired by the quick win and oral approval by the vice mayor, Agency I intended to extend the FDMIS to cover all the lifecycle information and processes about the real estate. Twelve subsystems were included in its formal plan. But Department F insisted that the FDMIS should focus on its internal operations. The long lasting (from 2004 to 2006) stalemate was ended with Agency I?s compromise. In the end, the FDMIS were developed and implemented as an internal operation supporting systems in department F, with almost the same budget planned at the initial stage. A schematic of various events and phases of the case is shown in figure 1.

Figure 1 Key events and phases   The research was conducted as an interpretive case  study [25-27]. In our fieldwork, one of our researchers was ?involved researcher? and the other three were ?outside researchers? [27]. Though involved, the involved researcher only acted as a recorder in the meetings and has not been taken as being aligned with any groups within the project. This guaranteed the neutral position of the researchers.

Data resources were collected in the following two ways. First, our main sources were the 48 formal meeting minutes, 5 audio records of meetings and 8 versions of the internal project report (all formal versions). These resources covered all the formal meetings and important formal documents during the design and implementation of FDMIS. Audio records were transcribed. In addition, relevant documents      pertaining to FDMIS were also collected from related departments and agency. Second, other resources include the in-depth, open ended interview. Interviews were conducted over three years between June 2003 and October 2006 with officers who were involved in FDMIS, as well as consultants from the consulting agency. The interviewed officers in FDMIS came from different layers and departments, ranging from the Mayor to the frontline officers and representing a diversity of organizational divisions in FDMIS. Totally 21 interviews have been conducted. All interviews were recorded and transcribed. Interview length varied, but a typical interview lasted from one to two hours.

An interpretive approach [25, 27] was employed in analyzing the qualitative data. In the data collection phase, no explicit theories have been employed by the authors. During the intensive discussion about the materials we collected, all the authors found there was a perfect match between the materials and the ANT.

We employed coding to make data-theory links.

Paradigms and concepts from ANT were utilized to identify and develop concepts, themes and issues in our analysis.

4. Evidence and analysis   This section describes how FDMIS was developed and implemented, carrying different interests and taking different shapes at different stages. We adopt and extend Callon?s [12] stages of translation to present the initiation and transformation of the actor- network created around FDMIS. These stages are problematization, interessement, enrollment, mobilization, and stabilization (our extension).

4.1. Problematization   From the 2000s, the real estate market in Shanghai  has developed in a startling rapidity, the prices of real estate have nearly doubled between 2000 and 2004 [28] and still in rocket from then on. To monitor the real estate transactions efficiently, the municipal government has been enforced in the nation?s 1998 amendment to the land management law which stipulates that all leasing of state lands to commercial developers has to pass through the hands of the municipalities. However, transaction information is highly fragmented, and large quantities of transaction information have not fulfilled the requirement on efficiency management on the real estate market.

Shanghai municipal governance is made up of 3 layers of administration vertically. In the municipal layer. There are more than fifty commissions, offices and bureaus, each in charge of some areas of municipal  administrations. The real estate administration, which is mainly the responsibilities of Department F, has relations to almost half of other commissions, offices and bureaus. No department has all the information about the land.

With the booming of the housing market, the Shanghai municipal government believed that there was an urgent need to adopt information technologies to increase administrative efficiency and transparency and to fend against low efficiency administration in real estate transactions.

Concerning the turbulence on the development of the real estate market and the fragmented information, the Mayor made a speech on the real estate administration in 2003 in which he mentioned that the information technology is a potential tool to make the administration more transparent and accountable. The Mayor said:  Concerning the misconducts uncovered in Shanghai real estate market, we need to investigate the requirements of a comprehensive land administration information system. The aim [of this information system] is to gather and manage the whole lifecycle information about each land. Completely reveal land resource information in the city to the public and help municipal decision making. Municipal leaders should know the trade, construction and profits of each land exactly. In addition, the information should open to the citizens to avoid the misconducts in this area.

(Referred in M-030709)  Agency I, a prior affiliation of Department X was commissioned to develop and implement an FDMIS to fulfill the administration requirement advocated by the municipal government. As soon as Agency I was commissioned, a systematic survey and research on the real estate market was started. The initial plan of FDMIS was completed based on Agency I?s research in July 2003. The stated goals fully satisfied the Mayor?s request to ?completely reveal land resource information in the city to the public and help municipal decision making.? The new system would be a cross- departmental transaction system with process re- engineering to manage the life cycle of land resources among various bureaus efficiently. The Mayor, therefore, approved the plan.

4.2. Interessement   Information systems are inscribed with  heterogeneous interests and each of these interests can be thought to be a delegate that speaks on their behalf.

The enrolment of other actors in networks surrounding the technology requires that these actors adopt attitudes and actions congruent with those of the interests      inscribed in the technology. Heterogeneous interests inscribed in the FDMIS (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Interests inscribed in FDMIS   First, the FDMIS reflects the municipal  government?s expectation on transparency, macro- control and misconducts prevention in the municipal real estate administration. In the macro-level, information systems always inscribe such macro- concerns as democracy, transparency, accountability, etc. [29]. In the initiation of FDMIS, the Mayor said:  The aim [of this information system] is to gather and manage the whole lifecycle information about each land. Municipal leaders should know the transaction, construction and profits of each land exactly. In addition, the information should open to the citizens to avoid misconducts in this area. (Referred in M-030709)  Second, the FDMIS presents potential for cross- departmental integration of process and information.

The potentials of information technologies enabled business transformation has been investigated in the business field [30]. Information technologies can be viewed as an enabler for the integrations of processes and information. In the public field, stage models [31] [32] have indicated process and information integration will be achieved with the development of e- government. The information technologies inscribe the abilities for the cross-departmental integration of process and information. In our field data, ?mutual connection and communications between municipal departments? has been mentioned quite often. In fact, it?s the focal point of the state?s strategic e-government plan in the 11th five-year strategic plan on e- government. Though currently the information and process about the land and house administration are highly fragmented and authorities distributed in almost half of the municipal departments. The intention to manage the information and processes integratively has  been mentioned throughout the project. For example, after an initial research on the land and house management, the director of Agency I said:  We should develop a system to operate the information and processes on the whole lifecycle of land and provide one-stop service in related functions and information services. (M-030709).

Third, the FDMIS inscribes the potential to improve the internal department operations. Internal efficiency improvement has been the direct intention of the e-government implementation in departments. It offers departments abilities to gather, share, store, and organize large volumes of data and information on a real-time basis. Departments can save money through more efficient tasks and less paperwork that becomes available through internal application of information technologies. Further more, departments can gain constant improvement in efficiency by institutionalize more tasks with information technologies with the infusion of information technologies. In addition, the legitimacy concern of operations in public sectors drives the departments to include more internal activities in the coverage of information technologies.

Fourth, participations in FDMIS can be a symbol of respect to the municipal government. Though have no substantial relations to the FDMIS, some department showed their enthusiasms verbally in the meetings when their superior, that is the municipal government asked them to participate. They took the participation as a symbol of respect to their superior. In this way, FDMIS inscribes the functions to show respect or obey the orders of the supervisor.

Finally, the implementation of the FDMIS will bring economic benefit to Agency I. Agency I actively advocated the FDMIS for it deemed it as a chance to gain economic benefit from the governmental budget.

In addition, successful development of the software and the implementation will bring long term benefit to Agency I for the software could be sold to other municipal governments. In one of the internal meetings, the director of Agency I said:  A specialized operation and maintenance organization would be established when FDMIS was completed. Simultaneously, we could develop a software product based on the system model. By promoting this product in the Chinese market, we could cover the prior investment and put forward the next round of development. We will push out the update with the development of information technologies and make it an industry in China. (M- 030728, M-030731, M-040203).

Till now, the story reveals a number of levels of interests within which the actors operate: the social level where, for instance, the society seeks to a transparent regulation environment, the organizational  Transparency, Accountability  Cross-departmental Integration of Processes and Information  Efficiency of Internal Operation  Show Respect to Superior  Economic Benefit from the implementation      level where, for example, there is a critical need for better coordination and control mechanism through inter-unit information processing and integrating, still yet the individual level where, for instance, the department head of F seeks to draw upon the interest of the Mayor to lend authority to his approach of enhancing department organic structure through improving intra-unit information processing capability, while other department heads seek to present their symbol of respond to the Mayor.

Heterogeneity of interests is an interesting concept involving the social, organizational and individual level. Here we have demonstrated how the heterogeneity of interests has been inscribed and interplayed as the source of technology flexibility.

However, at whatever level interest in influenced, researchers need to be able to understand the process that governs it. This leads to a further interesting question: how could the interpretive technology flexibility come into being through the project implementation.

4.3. Enrollment - project initiation (June 2003- August 2003)   After the initial plan, Agency I began to seek  budget from the municipal government. During this period, the Agency found that only a government department principal could gain government financial support, according to the regulations related to e- government projects. In other words, Agency I was not qualified to be the principal of FDMIS. However, compared to governmental departments, Agency I was more technologically competent to implement the system. If it could not supervise the project, Mayor H?s stated goals of this FDMIS project might not be fulfilled.

In this situation, Agency I has to enroll other departments to achieve its goals. Agent I decided to abandon its initial position to be the sole principal of the project and to become a co-principal of Department F, which is responsible for the municipal land resource management. However, the level of Agency I is lower than Department F because Agency I is under the supervision of Department X, which charges all civil affairs of computerization in Shanghai, and Department X is at the same administrative level as Department F. Given the Chinese bureaucracy?s implicit rules on authority relationship, Agency I could not negotiate with F and other same-level bureaus directly. Department X had to be enrolled in the network as a communication channel between Agency I and Department F and other bureaus whose interests would be affected by the new IT. After successfully getting X?s support, a complicated team satisfying  requirements from both Departments and the project needs was formed. Agency I and Department F formed a team responsible for implementation actions. In addition to members from both groups, Municipal government included the Mayor H, one Vice Mayor, and a Vice Secretary as corresponding leaders, and Department X as a communication channel between Agency I and other related bureaus.

Due to the heterogeneity of the inscribed interests, the different actors, which are municipal government, Agency I, Department X, F, Other related Departments and one nonhuman actor, FDMIS formulate a stable alliance. The artifact of FDMIS has not been clearly defined and each actor has its own interpretation of FDMIS.

4.4. Mobilization - phase I (August 2003- January 2004)   After a careful review and discuss on the initial  plan suggested by Agency I, Department F argued that the system should support its internal transactions first to avoid potential conflicts with other bureaus.

Department F also hoped that the system could focus on improving its information technology capability and internal transaction informatization, believing that the project implementation might be continued only if both sides reached consensus on the project?s objectives.

In order to keep the alliance, Agency I did not raise its? concern directly, although the system objectives suggested by Department F was far different from what was initially planned. However, Agency I still expected developing a system more than only support the internal functions of Department F.

With the help of Department X over the following weeks, Department F and Agency I had several meetings and reached an agreement on developing a system that could quickly fulfill the Mayor?s requirements and help Department F to significantly improve its administrative efficiency.

From August 2003 on, kick off team was organized by Department F, X and Agency I. Since Agency I had rich experiences in IT projects, and the technical leader on the team was a well respected professional who was also a member of the Chinese national informatization advisor committee, the project made substantial progress rapidly. After a one-month field study to analyze the requirements, the team came out with a new project plan. The project would expect to develop 12 subsystems with a central data resource management platform and database, with a 13 million USD budget. Responding to the Mayor?s specific requirements for the system (i.e. strengthening the land market supervision and make the land ownership transfer more transparent), the team decided to develop      a land ownership transaction system that can enable optimized transaction process across various bureaus.

This was also a full transaction system which could function to accomplish Department F?s major missions.

Since the technology, including the database system and developing techniques, had been proven feasible, the challenges were expected to be process re- engineering exercises and project management issues.

In October 2003, Department F became the project principal while Agency I became the co-principal and implementation service vendor. Department F commissioned Agency I to implement all related tasks.

Moreover, in order to avoid any underlying conflicts of interest among related bureaus in future project implementation, a joint meeting with participants from related departmental directors was established. Aligned the formal contract provisions, Agency I and Department F established a routine project team with people from different parties and sub-organizations.

The two organizations had a relatively sound cooperative relationship in implementing Phase 1 of the project.

After a more detailed field research, the project team found the land ownership transaction of several departments needed to be reengineered. The team realized that it was difficult to coordinate those departments in such a short period because any transaction process change in other departments required complicated negotiations and administrative procedures. Therefore, the project team decided to concentrate only on the reengineering work and information flow inside Department F. In this way, the team can confine the influence scope and avoid disturbing the regular administrative system. As a result, the original commitment transferred into building an internal transaction system with process reengineering in this period. Through the processes of prototype developing, modifying, formal developing, trying, training, testing, and promoting in the project, the first subsystem was implemented from November to December of 2003 and went live formally in January 2004. The Mayor was satisfied with the achievements and authorized a Deputy Vice Mayor to supervise the project in the future.

By implementation of the subsystem of FDMIS, interests of the actors are symbolically or partially fulfilled. To say the fulfillment is symbolic is on condition that the technology-in-practice is decoupled from but in the name of ?to enhance the transparency, accountability, macro-control and corruption prevention?. In the preface of the formal plan on the subsystem, the prior referred words are in bold to emphasize the fulfillment of this interest in the subsystems. Though the subsystem is not the ultimate system, it?s enough for the involved departments.

Especially to Department F and other related Department, all they needed is a sign of showing respects to their superior. To Department F, the efficiency of internal operation is only a byproduct.

The enacted FDMIS in this stage is a Land Transaction subsystem which excludes the cross-departmental processes.

The network is enhanced in this stage by successfully implementation of the subsystem.

Although the cooperation between Agency I and F in Phase 1 of the project was quite sound, most difficulties on cross-departmental process reengineering occurred in Phase 2.

4.5. Stabilization - phase II (January 2004-June 2008)   After the go-live of land transaction subsystem,  Phase II of the project was on schedule. The potential objectives incongruence between I and F soon arose.

To maximize the benefits within the team?s boundary based on the given budget, F insisted implementing internal transaction support systems to cover all its internal functions first.

Given the favorable achievements from Phase I, Agency I planned to extend the project to reach its original objective. However, to keep the enrolment of Department F, Agency I expressed this opinion indirectly in coordinating meetings with Department F but emphasized in the internal meeting that when communicate with Department F, it was essential to convince F that the whole plan will still cover all the functions of F.  The director of Agency I said:  [The first is] communication with Department F.

The admitted system by Department F has conflicts with our objectives, so it?s important to communicate with Department F. In the communication, our emphasis is to convince F that our two systems have covered all the core internal functions of F.? (M040101).

But F is not so easy to be convinced. From January to March 2004, Agency I helped several periphery departments simplify and re-design processes in real estate transaction administration. During this period, disagreement of implementation targets between Agency I and Department F still existed. For example, F was more concerned with work practices such as data structures and historical data collections, while Agency I emphasized the reengineering of the real estate management process and system design from a cross- sector perspective.

The first joint meeting among all related bureaus was held in April 2004. Just a few months earlier, in August 2003, the central government issued the Administrative Permission Law of the People?s      Republic of China which requires local governments to make land management more efficient, fair, and transparent. At the meeting, the authorized Deputy vice Mayor approved Agency I?s approach and acknowledged the project?s progress. He was aware of the difficulty of cross-departmental process reengineering but also treated the project as a good example of executing the Administrative Permission Law. He strongly supported the project to extend to cross-department. He commented:  The difficulty lies in the reorganization of the work process, and we should make more efforts. The Deputy Secretary will be involved in the reorganization issues.

I would participate on some crucial decisions. We should first make a clear plan on how to do, then to implement. The reorganization of the work process is the key point. In my opinion, we should be confident in successful implementation of the project (M-040409).

With support from the municipal government, Agency I distributed more resources to redesign the cross-departmental processes.  However, more and more complaints came out from involved bureaus during this period. Negotiations and communications among various bureaus were challenging to Agency I, who need to rely on Department X to interact with other bureaus. Unfortunately, X did not have enough administrative authority to convince other bureaus or to approve Agency I?s solution. More and more operational processes redesign remained unsolved.

Consequently, the project progress gradually slowed down. After three months, Agency I proposed a cross- departmental system analysis and design report to meet new requirements from the Administrative Permission Law. However, considering implementation feasibility, the plan was modified to develop a cross-departmental transaction support system with minimum process reengineering actions.

Since Department F was the project principal and Agency I agreed to work mostly with F?s major duties in the preparing and planning stage to get funded, most new functions were only beneficial to F, and other bureaus? transactions were designed to change according with F?s specification. Therefore, the design was still largely questioned by other bureaus which had the same hierarchical level as F. The situation became hard to coordinate even by the Deputy Secretary of the municipality. After repeatedly hearing complaints from different channels and places, he stated:  The cross-department transaction process redesign and integration could not be accomplished all at once.

Now, our new work flow design needs more study. The feasibility of the design needs to be further demonstrated. It may be reasonable and acceptable that we conclude that the work is a mission impossible after the study (M-040901).

Agency I carried out further study and reported to the Vice Deputy Mayor, but did not get response, which was a significant negative sign of  municipal support. One project team member at Agency I said,  In order to further promote the cross-department work process integration, Mr. Z[the director of Agency I] once wrote to the Vice Deputy Mayor using his personal relation, but got no response (I-1).

The Deputy Secretary also gave up the efforts to promote the project design. As the municipal government refused to comment on the cross- department design since August 2004, their behavior was understood as an implicit disagreement by team members. Moreover, the chief technical expert of Agency I left the team for personal reasons in late 2004.

The project leader of Agency I stated the following:  Without experts in government informatization, we cannot control the situation of the project anymore.

Top management support from the mayor has also become impossible. The cross-department work process redesign and system implementation is hard to continue (I-2).

In 2005, Agency I realized that the enrolment of Department F and other departments is unrealistic in its initial goals. Agency I gave up all initial designs and turned to fully satisfy F?s requirements. The FDMIS quickly transferred to a full internal operation support system for F. The content of the project decreased from 12 subsystems with a central data resource management platform and database to five subsystems with a bounded platform and database, while the total investment remained at the same level as initially budgeted (15 million USD). The FDMIS is expected to be completed by June 2008.

By partially dropping its initial goals, Agency I maintained the network and mobilized the alliance to finish the FDMIS. The FDMIS is enacted as an internal operation support system of Department F in the end.

5. Conclusion   From an information system that covered all the  land?s lifecycle related processes and information to an internal operation support system, FDMIS exhibited high flexibility during the design and implementation.

Drawing upon the ANT, the paper argues that inscribed interests are the source of the interpretive flexibility.

Inscribed interests are appealed, fulfilled and dropped in different phases (Table 1). Further, we propose that the heterogeneous interests constitute into an alliance through a phased networking and symbolization process.

The internal operation support system of Department F   Both theoretical and practical implications can be  drawn from the analysis of this case study.

By providing an alternative explanation of the  interpretive flexibility and investigating the process on how the flexibility comes into being, the paper argues that researchers will benefit from returning to origins of interpretive flexibility rather than solely relying on mental sides of human agency. We argue that the ?stabilization? of the flexibility can also occur when heterogeneous interests are fulfilled, either actually or symbolically, even though the similar interpretation among different groups is not reached. As concerned in the FDMIS cases, municipal government, Department F and Agency I had different interpretations on the FDMIS even in the latest stage of the implementation.

The municipal government deemed it as an information system to enhance the macro-level governance, and the  Department F took it as an internal operation support systems. And Agency I had no idea about the systems in the end. But the discordance among these three actors doesn?t inhibit the announcement of success about FDMIS in the end, for all the interests were fulfilled wholly or partially, actually or symbolically.

Our research also generates implications for practitioners to be aware of run-away IT projects.

First of all, the challenges of e-government projects, as is often the case with ERPs, are not technological ones. The key barrier lies with the resistance to the necessary institutional changes which e-government projects are designed to bring about. E-government projects which attempt to improve transparency and fight corruption inevitably touches upon political interests. They are unlikely to succeed without strong commitment from centralized authority. In this case, the project is only of symbolic importance to the mayor and most departments, and Agency I, the IT vendor, became the main driver of the inter-departmental system that was originally intended, which it fails to achieve in the end due to the absence of strong alliance from higher governmental authority.

Secondly, too much flexibility in project management will weaken the original functionalities planned. Take this case as an example, the initially planned cross-departmental and macro-level (enhance the transparency, accountability, macro-control and corruption prevention) functionalities have been weakened and even canceled in the end. We consider it should be related to the soft budget constraint in the e- government project. In some cases, the audit of e- government project means only to check the investment planned and reached, not to do with the functionalities. The complexity of advanced information systems and absence of IT professionals in e-government auditing also make it hard to set hard budget constraints on e-government projects. But practitioners in governments should pay attention to these types of run-away IT projects. More concrete terms about the functionalities of an intended system should be emphasized in the budget, and quantitative terms are preferred to vague requirements.

Our study focused on the design process of the system which demonstrates a great deal of interpretive flexibility. It would be useful to follow up the process when the system is adopted and used, and examine whether or how interpretive flexibility of the system was addressed. Nevertheless, this study shows governments that aim to reap the benefit of e- government should be ready to face the complexities and possible drifting of e-government projects, and to commit to a substantial transition within the government if the project is not only to serve symbolic values.
