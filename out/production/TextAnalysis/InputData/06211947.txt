An Object Tracking Scheme for Wireless Sensor  Networks Using Data Mining Mechanism

Abstract?Recently, object tracking application of sensor networks has drawn significant attention of the researchers due to its wide application. However, most of these studies cannot deal with the trade-off between energy efficiency and accuracy of the tracking. In object tracking sensor networks (OTSNs), the movement of the object generally follows some definite patterns.

The moving object location, arrival time, path are likely to hide some useful association rules, which can be excavated by applying suitable data mining algorithm. In this paper, we have proposed an object tracking scheme for OTSNs using data mining approach. We have improved the Apriori algorithm for mining association rules and made it applicable to the OTSNs.

The data mining algorithm is applied to the past movement information of the object and useful association rules are excavated, which are then used to predict the next location of the object. Our scheme predicts the next location of the object more accurately and increases the network lifetime. Experimental results have been conducted to evaluate the performance of our proposed scheme for OTSNs and they show that our scheme outperforms the existing schemes in terms of energy efficiency and accuracy of tracking.

I.  INTRODUCTION Wireless sensor network (WSN) is composed of large  number of small sized, inexpensive and computable sensors, which are limited in power, memory and computation.

Normally, large numbers of tiny sensors are deployed randomly to monitor one or more phenomena, to collect and process the sensed data, and to send the data back to the sink.

The important applications of WSN include environmental monitoring, object tracking application, personal healthcare, and enemy monitoring [1][2]. These kinds of applications introduce new challenges for WSN, among which tracking of objects in sensor networks has attracted extensive attentions [3]. In such applications, users are interested in events instead of the identity of a particular sensor. Energy consumption is the primary consideration in designing an object tracking sensor network and most related research works [5][6] focus on reducing energy consumption. The use of a sleeping mechanism is one of the most effective energy saving methods.

In object tracking sensor networks (OTSNs), power consumption is a major issue, which directly affects the  lifetime of the network. Energy can be conserved in OTSNs by putting a sensor node to sleep when there is no object in the node?s sensing region and turn on a sensor node when an object is to enter the node?s sensing region. Based on this idea, the research for energy conservation in OTSNs can be classified into two types: non-prediction tracking and prediction tracking [4]. In non-prediction tracking, the sensor nodes are periodically put to sleep in order to conserve energy and they wake up after some time to monitor the sensing region and collect the object movement information. On the other hand, prediction based tracking uses the latest detected location of the object, its average speed and direction of travel to predict the next location of the object. By this way, only the sensor nodes at the predicted location of the objects can be active and thus saving significant amount of energy. However, these predictions may not be entirely correct, which leads to loss of object, and large amount of energy may be wasted in recovering the object. In real-world applications, the behavior of the moving objects is often based on certain underlying events, instead of complete randomness. We observe that many creatures such as animals, birds usually form mass organization and migrate together for food.  Many recent works have focused on application of data mining technology in OTSNs to discover useful association rules from past movement information of the object. The discovered association rules are then compared with the movement behavior of the object under observation to predict its next location. Use of association rules in predicting the next location of the object helps to improve the performance of prediction and increase the accuracy of tracking.

The authors proposed an object tracking algorithm by mining object movement data from its temporal movement patterns [4]. They construct a temporal movement pattern tree from the temporal movement log of the object, which is used to identify the useful association rules and forecast the next location of the object. In another research work, the authors proposed a multi-level wireless sensor networks construction based on K-mean clustering technique [5]. They first conduct the hierarchical clustering to form a hierarchical model for the sensor nodes. Then the movement logs of the objects are analyzed by a data mining algorithm to obtain the movement rules, which are used to predict the next position of the object.

The authors proposed a technique for mining region movement patterns based on the three kinds of movements pattern i.e.,     node-to-node, node to region and region to region movement pattern [6]. First, a data mining methodology is proposed for discovering the region-based movement patterns of moving objects in OTSNs. Moreover, they also proposed the corresponding prediction strategies for tracking objects in an energy-efficient way. The authors proposed a seamless data mining algorithm named STMP-Mine to efficiently discover the temporal movement patterns of objects in sensor networks without predefining the time segment [7]. They also proposed a location prediction strategy that employs the discovered temporal movement patterns to reduce prediction errors to save energy.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces the network environment of OTSNs. Section III presents our association rule mining for OTSNs. Section IV presents the results of performance evaluation. Section V concludes this paper.



II. NETWORK ENVIRONMENT The network architecture consists of a large number of  sensor nodes deployed in the monitoring region and each node is equipped with sensor memory to record the object movement information as shown in Fig. 1. The object movement information is transmitted to the sink and at the same time each node also maintains its own record table containing the object movement information. Table I shows an example of the table of sensor node 17. From the table we can see that the frequency count of the node 17 is 6, because it has detected six object movements. The probability that an object moves from node 17 to node 23 is 50%, node 21 is 33% and node 20 is 16%. After gathering the object movement information at the sink node for a certain period of time, object movement sequence table is formed at the sink node as shown in Table II. This table contains the sequence of movement of all the objects and it serves as the transaction database for discovering association rule to predict the next location of an object.

III. ASSOCIATION RULE MINING FOR OTSNS In OTSNs, the movement of the object generally follows  some definite patterns instead of complete randomness. The moving object location, arrival time, path are likely to hide some useful association rules which can be excavated by applying suitable data mining algorithm. The authors have proposed a data mining algorithm called Apriori algorithm for discovering association rules from a large data base of transaction [8]. The algorithm makes several passes over the transaction database and in each pass it finds the set of items (or itemsets) whose support count is more than the minimum support count. Let?s consider the transaction database D given in Table III. In the first iteration of the algorithm, each item is a member of the set of candidate 1-itemsets, C1. Suppose that the minimum support count required is 2. The set of frequent 1 itemsets L1 is the sets of items in C1, whose number of occurrence in D is more than 2 as shown in Table IV(A). In next pass, the algorithm performs a join of L1 on L1 to obtain the candidate 2-itemsets C2 and the set of frequent 2 itemesets L2 can be constructed by collecting all the items in C2, whose support count is more than 2 as shown in Table IV(B). This procedure is repeated until no more frequent k-item sets can be found.

In OTSNs, an association rule is useful only when it follows the object movement sequence. The association rules, which are not part of the object movement sequence, can be discarded as they might not be feasible. Based on the above observation, we can prune the frequent item sets in each iteration, so that it contains only useful entries. For example, the candidate 2-itemsets C2 can be obtained for the transaction data base of Table II. Suppose that the minimum support count required is 2. All the entries in C2, whose support count is less than the minimum support are removed and the remaining entries of C2 form the frequent 2 items-set (L2) which has been shown in Table V(A).  All the entries in L2 is then searched  in the object movement log in the Table II  and the entries which are not found are discarded to form the pruned frequent 2 itemset L2? as shown in Table V(B). For example, L2 includes the entries 1 6, 1 10, 1 14, and 1 17. However, since only 1 6 exists in Table II, L2? does not includes the entries 1  10, 1 14 and 1 17. We can apply the similar procedures to get L3?, L4?, L5?, and L6? as shown in Table VI.

IV. SIMULATION RESULTS In this section, we evaluate the performance of our  proposed method under varying conditions by altering the parameters such as number of sensor nodes and number of  528 2012 IEEE Network Operations and Management Symposium (NOMS): Short Papers    objects. The simulation parameters have been given in Table

VII. We design a simulation model with an object generator, which randomly produces the distribution of sensors. We use x-y coordinate axis to represent the location of a sensor and assume that no distinct sensors are present in the same location.

We compare our object tracking using data mining scheme (OTDM) with the MLS scheme [5]. As shown in Fig. 5(a), the average remaining energy for our scheme is more than that of MLS scheme. This is because of the fact that lesser number of sensor nodes is active at any time in our scheme than MLS.

Fig. 5(b) shows the result of missing rate for varying number of sensor nodes from 100 to 1000. As shown in Fig.

4(b), the missing rate of our scheme is less than that of MLS.

The reason is that our scheme uses the data mining approach to predict the next location of the tracking object. Hence, the accuracy of prediction is more in case of OTDM.

V. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have proposed an object tracking scheme  for WSNs. We have improved the Apriori algorithm for mining object moving association rules and applied it to the OTSNs. Data mining algorithm is applied to the past movement logs of the object and the useful association rules are excavated to increase the accuracy of the tracking.

Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the existing MLS scheme in both of energy-efficiency and accuracy of tracking.  Our method can reduce the number of active sensor nodes at any time thus energy consumption in OTSNs can be reduced. In addition, the missing rate of our scheme is less than that of MLS because our approach considers past movement behavior of the object in predicting its next location.
