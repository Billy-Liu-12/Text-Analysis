e-NFIS: Efficient Negative Frequent Itemsets Mining only based on Positive Ones

Abstract-Negative association rules (NAR) mining, which has played important roles in real applications, mainly focuses on  the form A=>B, A=>?B, -..4=>B and ?A=>?B so far, where A (e.g. (ala2)) and B (e.g. (b1b2)) are occurring itemsets. Another form of negative association rules, such as al?a2=>bl?b2' which contain occurring ( or positive) items and non-occurring (or  negative) items, can also reflect the relations of item sets from  another angle. The first step to mine this form of NAR is to  mine negative frequent item sets (NFIS). This paper mainly  focuses on this step and proposes a novel method, e-NFIS  ("fficient negative frequent item?ets), to mine NFIS. The main  idea of e-NFIS is to mine NFIS only from positive frequent  itemsets (PFIS). E-NFIS contains three aspects: 1) using traditional method to mine PFIS; 2) an efficient method to generate negative candidate itemsets from PFIS; 3) calculate the support of negative candidate itemsets only using the  support of PFIS, without additional database scanning.

Experimental results show that the e-NFIS is efficient.

I. INTRODUCTION  Negative association rules (NARs) have been proved very useful and can play more important roles than positive association rules (PARs) in some applications [1,2,3]. But the NARs in these papers mainly focus on the form A??B , ?A?B and ?A??B , where left side A (e.g. (ala2 )) and right side ?B (e.g. ? (b1b2 )) are all occurring (positive) itemsets or all non-occurring (negative) itemsets. Another form of NARs, such as al?a2 ?bl?b2 ' which contains both positive and negative items in each side, can also reflect the relations of itemsets from another angle [4]. Generally, there are two steps to mine this form of negative association rules as PARs mining does. First step is to mine negative frequent item?ets (NFIS), such as (al?a2bl?b2). The second step is to mine NARs from these NFIS. The first step is more difficult than the second one, and most researchers focused on this step and their methods to mine NFIS are to modifY the existed methods used in positive frequent item sets mining (PFIS) [5,6].

This paper also focuses on the first step and proposes a novel and efficient NFIS mining method named e-NFIS. The difference between e-NFIS and the existed methods is that e? NFIS only mines NFIS from PFIS. It is this constraint that lets e-NFIS can use some special advantages to get fast performance. The contributions of this paper are as follows.

(1) An efficient method to generate negative fandidate item?ets (NCIS);  (2) We calculate the support of negative candidate item sets only using the support of PFIS, almost without any additional time and spacious cost.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II is related works. Section III is our method e-NFIS. Section IV is experimental results and section V is conclusions and future work.
