I. INTRODUCTION  In many engineering applications, the measurement of speed and distant is always translated into the measurement of time. TDC-GP2 is a highly cost-effective product in a number of chronometry chips, so it has an unparalleled advantage in engineering applications. The working principle of the laser rangefinder based on TDC-GP2 is that laser transmitter device launches a beam of light pulses to the measured target, and then the receiver device receives the reflected light from the target pulse, finally the time t experienced back and forth by the light pulse is calculated by TDC-GP2. Then, we can calculate the distance between range finder. and target according to the time t. The formula is as follows: S=v*t/2, v represents the speed of light and equals 3*103m/s. In the above formula data processing system has an important influence on processing precision of laser pulse signal and laser ranging accuracy. As for the traditional direct pulse counting method, it is not difficult to achieve the general precision indicator. However, due to the device, process and many other factors, the direct counting method is hard to complete the task for the cm-level distance measurement accuracy requirements. In recent years as the time measurement technology has improved continuously, using the time digital chip (TDC) can achieve the above requirements. In the following paragraphs, this paper will introduce the chip TDC-GP2 and the implementation of the range finder in detail.[1]   *Correspondence: Jiong-ru Zhou , zhoujiongruru @163.com

II. INTRODUCTION OF TDC-GP2  A. TDC-GP2 Features  TDC-GP2 is a Germany ACAM?s next generation product of TDC Series. It has higher accuracy and smaller package, especially for the low-cost industrial applications.

TDC-GP2 has a high-speed pulse generator. And it has such functions like stopping enabling energy, measuring temperature and controlling the clock. All these above function modules make it particularly suitable for ultrasonic flow measurement, thermal measurement and laser ranging measurement. TDC-GP2 can be viewed as a peripheral device of the SCM when it is used. TDC-GP2 is used to sample the transmitting and receiving of pulse laser under the control of the SCM, and then transmit the sampling signal to the ALU unit that can calculate the time interval.

Ultimately the results are saved into the result register. By setting the internal register of TDC-GP2, it can sample and save the results several times. The SCM reads data from result register by a certain algorithm, and then gains RMS to reduce the error, and at the same time do appropriate processing according to specific applications.

There are many advantages in laser range finding by using TDC-GP2. As follows:  a) Directly change the time into digital to output and no need conversion process.

b) The resolution is up to 65ps, and the single measurement accuracy is 0.98cm by converting into distance. If we adopt the method of averaging multiple measurements, the accuracy can be achieved to 10ps. In other words, it is 1.5mm by converting into distance.

c) Ultra-low power consumption. When using the measuring range 2, one time measurement and one time calibration is executed every second. When the power supply is 5V, the current consumption is only 3uA. Such a low power consumption makes the TDC-GP2 particularly suitable for hand-held range-finder.

B. TDC-GP2 supplies two measurement range:  a) Measurement Range 1 LSB: 65ps.

Measurement range: 2.0ns ?? 1.8?s.

The ability to distinguish pulse interval: 15ns.

Two stop channels share one start channel.

Each stop channel can sample four times.

Each channel can select rising/ failing edge triggering.

The typical resolution for each channel is 50ps rms (root mean square).

ENABLE pin provides a strong stop signal enabling function to measure the time interval between any two signals[2].

The timing diagram of measurement range 1 is as the figure 1:  Figure 1. The Timing diagram of asurement range 1  Figure 1: Calibration Delay: tva=4.6us.

Non-Calibration Delay: tva=580ns.

Pulse Width: tph= tpl=2.5ns.

Maximum Measurement Range: tyy=1.8us.

The Time Interval between Rising Edge and Failing Edge:  trr=tff=15ns.

The Time Interval between start Signal and stop Signal:  3.5ns<tss<1.8us.

The maximum measurement range of measurement range  1 is tyy=1.8us. According to s=v*t/2, we can achieve the maximum measurement range of measurement range 1 is: s=v*tyy/2=270m (tyy is the laser round-trip time and needs to divide by 2.)  The maximum measurement range is only 270m, so it is not enough to several occasions that need long distance. As the result, we can choose the measurement range 2.

b)  Measurement Range 2 It has three sub-sample capacity.

It can select rising/ failing edge triggering.

The typical resolution is 50ps rms.

Measurement Range: 2*Tref??4ms.

The ability to distinguish pulse interval: 2*Tref.

Only one stop channel corresponds to start channel.

Each single stop signal has as adjustable window whose  accuracy is 10ns, and it can provide accurate stop enabling.

The timing diagram of measurement range 2 is as the  figure 2:  Figure 2. . Timing figure of TDC-GP2 measurement range 2  Figure 2: Effective Delay: tva=4.6us.

Maximum Measurement Range: tyy=4ms.

Pulse Width: tph= tpl=2.5ns.

The Time Interval between Rising Edge and Failing  Edge: trr=tff=2*Tref.

The Time Interval between start Signal and stop Signal:  2*Tref<tss<12*Tref.

The maximum measurement range of measurement range  2 is up to 4ms, and is can meet with this rangefinder.

Inadequately, there are 2*Tref measurement blind area in measurement range 2, and the distance of the corresponding blind area is 75m when the frequency is under 4M[3].

There are two methods  to  to solve the question that measurement range  short in measurement range 1 and measurement  prescion low in measurement range 2. The details are as fellows:  ? One method is adopt both measurement range 1 and 2 in a rangefinder system. When the measurement range is less than 270m, range 1 is chose to measure the distance. When the measurement range is larger than 270m,  range 2  is adopt to measure the distance. Such program not only eliminates the blind spots, but also expands the measurement range.

However, the designation of hardware will become very complicated, and it will cause the hardware cost increasing and lead to new error[4].

? Separately use the measurement range 2, and do corresponding disposal to eliminate measurement blind spots in the software. This laser rangefinder of telescope pattern just uses this method and it will introduce in the following paragraphs in detail.



III. THE HARDWARE DESIGNATION OF THE RANGEFINDER  The range finding principle of these typical pulse lasers rangefinder systems are as follows: Pulse laser is transmitted by laser device and goes through the light division mirror.

Then parts of energies are transmitted to PIN photoelectricity detector and converted into electricity pulses that will be amplified and reshaped to obtain ideal electricity pulses[5].

These pulses will be conveyed to TDC-GP2 and viewed as the starting of triggering pulse. Another parts of energies will transferred to destination. These laser pulses that are reflected from destination will be converted into electricity pulse that will obtain ideal electricity pulse by identical signal processing circuit. These pulses will be conveyed to TDC-GP2 and viewed as the ending of triggering pulse.

The advantages of the typical pulse laser rangefinder system are as follows: Trigger the starting and ending of TDC-GP2 by using pulse. The reaction velocity is fast and the error is low. What?s more, timing starting and ending signals pass through the same signal processing circuit.

Therefore, TDC-GP2 will not bring in new errors because of the signal processing circuit when it measures the time interval. The disadvantages are: the maximum measurement range of measurement range 1 is only 270m while there are 2*Tref measurement blind spots in measurement range 2.

In order to solve the above problems, this rangefinder system will adopt the following designation methods:     TDC-GP2 selects the measurement range 2. The starting triggering signal of this range is triggered by a laser pulse not provided from bunch division mirror, but directly from SCM.

At first, SCM provides a starting triggering signal, and then the signal will delay for 2*Tref long time. Ultimately the laser device receives the triggering signals and transmits the laser pulses. The laser pulses reflected from the destination is converted into electricity pulses, and then the pulses are amplified and reshaped to obtain the ideal electricity pulses.

Ultimately, they are transferred to TDC-GP2 and viewed as timing ending triggering pulse[6]. The detected destination distance is calculated according to the starting, ending minute and delay minute.

The model of SCM that this laser rangefinder chooses is STC12LESA40S2. Its periphery circuit connection schematic diagram is shown in Figure 3:  Figure 3.

IV. THE SOFTWARE DESIGNATION OF THE RANGEFINDER  A. Eliminate Blind Area  This system adopts measurement range 2 to achieve the measurement. But there is a blind area in measurement range 2. In the following parts the reason for the emergence and the  elimination method of measurement area will be introduced in detail.

The reason for the emergence of measurement area is as follows: the minimum interval time is 2*Tref between start signal and stop1 signal, and any signals returned in this range are not accepted effectively. Therefore, in order to avoid measurement error caused by ineffective signals, a 2*Tref long time delay can be given by system after the start signal.

Then the system transmits the laser signal, and the signal returned is received by stop1. Third, the time interval measurement unit of TDC-GP2 calculates the corresponding measurement results. This way can meet with the requirement of this rangefinder well.

B. Data Processing  There are several disturbance signals in the corresponding data returned by the above method. The frequencies and amplitudes of these disturbance signals may be similar with the effective signals, so it is difficult to distinguish the disturbance signals from the effective signals in once measurement. However, considering measuring the same one destination, the time measurements corresponding to the effective signals returned in a short time (ms level) are mainly similar. At the same time, the time measurements corresponding to the disturbance signals are not always regular. As a result, select a densest group of signals from several times measurements, and then calculate the mean value.

Concrete algorithm idea is as follows (Supposed signals are sampled 100 times, and choose the 64th as the effective signal to calculate the mean value): At first, save the 100 groups of data returned from the system sampling into the array; Secondly, sort the 100 digits in the array (from big to small); Thirdly, supposed the step width is 64 and the result that obtained by the last digit minus the first digit is saved in another array; Fourthly, compare the D-value array after subtraction and find the minimum digit whose subscript corresponds to the first address of the densest digit; Ultimately, select the densest digits and calculate the mean value that is just the effective value. The value choosing of the sampling numbers and effective signal numbers can select by yourself according to the specific application.



V.    CONCLUSION  This scheme fully considers the characteristics of  TDC- GP2. On the basis of the realistic requirement of this rangefinder system, measurement blind area is eliminated, circuit architecture is optimized, development circle and cost is decreased and the entire performance of the system is largely promoted on both volume and accuracy. This type of designation ideology enable the performance of this system promotes a lot compared with the previous products. The experiment results indicate the measurement accuracy of this laser rangefinder can be up to mm level, so that it is convenient to carry and the reaction time is fast. This can meet with the requirement of realistic applications and particularly suit for such application occasion as wild measurement that needs fast and dynamic measurement.
