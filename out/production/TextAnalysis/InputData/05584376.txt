AbstractIn this paper, we adopt a more sophisticated  multi-objective approach, SPEA2, to find appropriate sets of  membership functions for fuzzy data mining. Two objective  functions are used to find the Pareto front. The first one is to  minimize the suitability of membership functions and the  second one is to maximize the total number of large 1-itemsets.

An experimental comparison with the previous approach is also  made to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in  finding the Pareto-front membership functions.



I. INTRODUCTION  Many approaches have been proposed for mining fuzzy  association rules [1, 12, 19, 20, 24] in fuzzy data mining. The  fuzzy mining algorithms developed earlier were mainly based  on the Apriori algorithm and some based on the FP trees was  recently developed. Fuzzy mining algorithms with multiple  minimum supports of different items were developed as well  [20]. Most of the previous fuzzy data mining algorithms  assumed the membership functions were already known.

Pre-defined membership functions are not actually suitable in  usage. Mining algorithms that can automatically derive both  the appropriate membership functions and the fuzzy rules are  thus required. Many approaches have thus been proposed for  deriving membership functions in data mining [3, 4, 10, 11,  15, 16].

Besides, several criteria may be considered in a real  application. The multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, that  are used to find a set of solutions with trade-offs among  different criteria, are thus very suitable for solving such a task  [6, 7]. Kaya et al. proposed an approach that integrated the  multi-objective genetic algorithm into clustering for fuzzy  mining [17]. Kaya also proposed an approach based on  multi-objective genetic algorithms for mining optimized  fuzzy association rules [18]. We also proposed a fuzzy  mining approach based on the Multi-Objective Genetic  Algorithm (MOGA) to find the Pareto front of the desired  membership functions [2].

In this paper, we adopt a more sophisticated  multi-objective approach, SPEA2 [25], to find the appropriate    sets of membership functions for fuzzy data mining.

is usually regarded as having a better effect than MOGA. It  adopts a fine-grained fitness assignment strategy, a density  estimation technique, and an enhanced archive truncation  method to derive better Pareto solutions [25]. Two objective  functions are used here to find the Pareto front of membership  functions. The first one is to minimize the suitability of  membership functions and the second one is to maximize the  total number of large 1-itemsets. An experimental  comparison with the previous approach is also made to show  the effectiveness of the proposed approach in finding the  Pareto-front membership functions.



II. GA-BASED MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS  A multi-objective optimization problem can be defined as  follows:  Min/Max y = g(x) = (g1(x), g2(x), , gm(x)),  subject to x = (x1, x2, ..., xn) ? X and y = (y1, y2, ..., ym) ? Y,  where x is the decision vector, y is the objective vector, X  represents the decision space, and Y represents the objective  space. In the past, several GA-based approaches were  proposed to get the solutions. For example, Schaffer proposed  the Vector Evaluated Genetic Algorithm (VEGA) to solve the  multi-objective optimization problem [22]. Fonseca et al.

proposed a modified approach called Multi-Objective  Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) by using the extended  rank-based fitness assignment [9]. They defined three  relationships among chromosomes, namely inferiority,    superiority and non-inferiority. Besides, some variants of  MOGA were also proposed. Two well-known approaches are  NSGA-II [8] and SPEA2 [25]. Their main purpose was to get  better Pareto fronts. NSGA-II used a fast non-dominated  sorting procedure, an elitist strategy, and an approach without  parameters to achieve this [8]. SPEA2 adopted a fine-grained  fitness assignment strategy, a density estimation technique,  and an enhanced archive truncation method to derive better  Pareto solutions [25].



III. THE SPEA2-BASED MULTI-OBJECTIVE GENETIC-FUZZY  MINING APPROACH  In this paper, we propose a SPEA2-based approach to  derive the set of non-dominated solutions for fuzzy mining  problems. The details of the proposed approach are described  below.

A. Chromosome Representation  It is important to encode membership functions as string  representation for GAs to be applied. Several possible  encoding approaches have been described in [5, 21, 23]. In  this paper, each membership function is assumed to be  isosceles-triangle and represented by a pair (c, w), with c  A SPEA2-based Genetic-Fuzzy Mining Algorithm  Chun-Hao Chen, Tzung-Pei Hong and Vincent S. Tseng  978-1-4244-8126-2/10/$26.00 2010 IEEE        indicating the center abscissa and w representing half the span.

All pairs of (c, w)'s for a certain item are concatenated to  represent its membership functions. Since both c and w are  numeric values, a chromosome is thus encoded as a  fixed-length real-number string rather than a bit string.

B. Initial Population  A genetic algorithm requires a population of feasible  solutions to be initialized and updated during the evolution  process. As mentioned above, each individual within the  population is a set of isosceles-triangular membership  functions. Each membership function corresponds to a  linguistic term in a certain item. The initial set of  chromosomes is randomly generated with some constraints  for forming feasible membership functions.

C. The Two Objective Functions    Kaya et al. proposed an approach to derive membership  functions for mining problems [15]. It could get a maximum  profit (maximum number of large itemsets) within an interval  of user specified minimum support values. The derived  membership functions were then used to mine fuzzy  association rules. In our previous work, we have also  proposed a genetic-fuzzy approach to learn an appropriate set  of membership functions for mining problems [11]. In that  paper, the fitness values were evaluated by the numbers of  large 1-itemsets over the suitability of membership functions.

The two factors (numbers of large 1-itemsets and suitability  of membership functions) usually show a trade-off  relationship. In this paper, we thus consider the mining of  membership functions and fuzzy association rules as a  multi-objective optimization problem, in which the above  two factors are used as two objectives functions. A  SPEA2-based mining algorithm is thus proposed to find the  Pareto optimal solutions. The first objective function (Obj1)  for a chromosome Cq is defined as follows:  )()(1 qq CysuitabilitCObj = ,  where suitability(Cq) represents the shape suitability of the  membership functions with Cq. Suitability(Cq) is defined as:  )],(_)(_[   qjqj  m  j  CfactorcoverageCfactoroverlap +?

=  where m is the number of items. Overlap_factor(Cqj)  represents the overlap factor of the membership functions for  an item Ij in the chromosome Cq and is defined as:  ?

?

?=  ik jijk  jijk  qj ww  RRoverlap  Cfactoroverlap ],1)1),  ),min(  ),(    [max(()(_    where Rjk denotes the membership function of the k-th  linguistic term of item Ij, overlap(Rjk, Rji) is the overlap length  of Rjk and Rji. Coverage_factor(Cqj) represents the coverage  ratio of a set of membership functions for an item Ij in the  chromosome Cq and is defined as:  )max(  )...,,(  1)(   j  jlj  qj  I  RRrangeCactorcoverage_f =  ,  where range(Rj1, Rj2, , Rjl) is the coverage range of the  membership functions, l is the number of membership  functions for Ij, and max(Ij) is the maximum quantity of Ij in  the transactions. The suitability factor is used to reduce the  occurrence of the two bad kinds of membership functions,  where the first one is too redundant and the second one is too  separate [11].

The second objective function is the total number of large  1-itemsets in a given set of minimum support values {ms1,  ms2, , msh}. It is formally defined as follows:  ?

=  ==  h  g  ms  qqq  gL)(CtotalNumL1CObj   12 ||)( ,  where || 1 g  ms  qL  is the number of large 1-itemsets obtained when  the minimum support value is msg. Using the number of large  1-itemsets can achieve a trade-off between execution time    and rule interestingness. Usually, a larger number of  1-itemsets will result in a larger number of all itemsets with a  higher probability, which will thus usually imply more  interesting association rules. In this paper, the proposed  approach uses the above two objective functions to find  appropriate Pareto solutions for the genetic-fuzzy mining  problems.

D. Fitness Assignment  The fitness assignment is similar to that used in SPEA2  [25]. The fitness of a chromosome Cq is calculated by using  the formula as follows:  f(Cq) = R(Cq) + D(Cq),  where R(Cq) is the raw fitness of a chromosome, and D(Cq) is  the density information of a chromosome. The raw fitness is  used to exhibit the strength of each chromosome, and is  defined as follows:  ? +?= qjPPjq jSCR ;, )()( ,  where the strength value S(j) is the number of solutions it  dominates of chromosome Cj, and is calculated as follows:  S(j) = |{j | j ? P + P ? ji ; }|,  where |?| means the cardinality of a set, + represents multiset  union and the symbol ;  means the Pareto dominance  relation. In other words, the raw fitness of a chromosome is  determined by the strength of its dominators in both the  population P and the archive P . Thus, the lower the raw  fitness is, the better the chromosome is. The density  information of a chromosome Cq is defined as follows:   1)(  +  = k  q  qCD ?

,  where ?qk is the distance of Cq to its k-th nearest chromosome  in both the population P and the archive P , and k is  calculated by NN + . The density information is used to  distinguish the difference of chromosomes which have the  same raw fitness.

E. Genetic Operators  Genetic operators are important to the success of specific  GA applications. Two genetic operators, the  max-min-arithmetical (MMA) crossover proposed in [1] and  the one-point mutation, are used in the proposed approach.

The MMA crossover operator will generate four candidate  chromosomes from them. The best two chromosomes of the  four candidates are then chosen as the offspring. The  one-point mutation operator will create a new fuzzy  membership function by adding a random value ? (between  -wjk to + wjk ) to the center or to the spread of an existing  linguistic term, say Rjk. Assume that c and w represent the  center and the spread of Rjk. The center or the spread of the  newly derived membership function will be changed to c + ?

or w + ? by the mutation operation. Mutation at the center of a  fuzzy membership function may however disrupt the order of  the resulting fuzzy membership functions. These fuzzy  membership functions then need rearrangement according to  their center values.



IV. THE PROPOSED MINING ALGORITHM  The proposed SPEA2-based genetic-fuzzy minng  algorithm for deriving both membership functions and fuzzy  association rules is described below.

INPUT: A body of n quantitative transactions, a set of m  items, each with a number of linguistic terms, a set  of minimum support values {ms1, ms2, , msh}, a  population size N, an archive size N , a crossover  rate Pc, a mutation rate Pm, a number of generation G  and a confidence threshold ?.

OUTPUT: A set of non-dominated solutions (sets of  membership functions) with their fuzzy association  rules.

STEP 1: Randomly generate a population P of N individuals,  with each one being a set of membership functions  for all the m items, encode each set of membership  functions into a string representation according to  the schema stated in Section 3, and initialize the  non-dominated (archive) set P  as empty.

STEP 2: For each chromosome Cq, calculate its two objective  values, the suitability and the total number of large  1-itemsets according to the given set of minimum    support values {ms1, ms2, , msh}, by the following  substeps.

SUBSTEP 2.1: For each transaction datum Di, i = 1 to n,  and for each item Ij, j = 1 to m, transfer the  quantitative value vj(i) into a fuzzy set fj(i) represented  as:  ???

?

???

?

+++  jl  i  jl  j  i  j  j  i  j  R  f  R  f  R  f )(   )(    )(  1 .... ,  using the corresponding membership functions  represented by the chromosome, where Rjk is the k-th  fuzzy region (term) of item Ij, fjk(i) is vj(i)s fuzzy  membership value in region Rjk, and l (= |Ij|) is the  number of linguistic terms for Ij.

SUBSTEP 2.2: For each item region Rjk, calculate its scalar  cardinality on the transactions as follows:  ?

=  =    n  i  i  jkjk fcount   )( .

SUBSTEP 2.3: For each Rjk , 1 ? j ? m, 1? k ? |Ij|, check  whether countjk is larger than or equal to the set of  minimum support values {ms1, ms2, , msh} . If Rjk  satisfies the above condition, set || 1  gms  qL  = || 1 g  ms  qL  + 1, where || 1  gms  qL  is the number of large 1-itemsets  obtained by using the set of membership functions in  chromosome Cq and the minimum support value msg;  let the second objective value of Cq be the following:  ?

=  =  h  g  ms  qq  gL)(CtotalNumL1   1 || .

SUBSTEP 2.4: Calculate the suitability value suitability(Cq)  by using the formula defined in Section 3; set it as  the first objective value of Cq.

STEP 3: Calculate the raw fitness R(Cq) of each chromosome  Cq by using the formula defined in Section III.

STEP 4: Calculate the density information D(Cq) of each  chromosome Cq by using the formula defined in  Section III.

STEP 5: Set the fitness value of each chromosome as follows:  f(Cq) = R(Cq) + D(Cq).

STEP 6: Copy nondominated chromosomes to archive P . In  other words, the chromosomes with their fitness    values smaller than one will be copied to the archive.

STEP 7: Execute environmental selection according to the  number of chromosomes in the archive. There are  three cases.

(1) If the number of chromosomes in the archive  | P | equals to N , go to the next step.

(2) If the number of chromosome in the archive  is smaller than N , select the best ( N - | P |)  dominated chromosomes with their fitness values  larger than one from the previous population and  archive.

(3) Otherwise, if the number of chromosomes in  the archive exceeds N , use the truncation operator  to reduce the size of the archive. At each iteration,  the chromosome Cq with the smallest ?qk, which is  the distance of Cq to its k-th nearest chromosome in  the archive, is removed until | P | = N . In case of  many chromosomes have the same minimum  distance, the second smallest distance is chosen for  removal, and so on.

STEP 8: Use the selection operation to choose appropriate  individuals from the archive P  to form the next  generation. Here, the binary tournament selection is  performed.

STEP 9: Execute the crossover operation on the population.

STEP 10: Execute the mutation operation on the population.

STEP 11: If the termination criterion is not satisfied, go to  Step 2; otherwise, do the next step.

STEP 12: Mine fuzzy association rules from the given  database and based on the derived chromosomes in  archive P , where each chromosome represents a set  of membership functions. The fuzzy mining  algorithm proposed in [13] is then adopted to  achieve this purpose for each set of membership  functions.

STEP 13: Output the archive P  and their corresponding  fuzzy association rules.



V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS  In this section, experiments made to show the performance    of the proposed approach are described. A simulation dataset  with 64 items and 10000 transactions were used in the  experiments. The dataset followed the exponential  distribution. The initial population size P is set at 50, the  archive size is set at 30, the crossover rate pc is set at 0.8, and  the mutation rate pm is set at 0.001. The parameter d of the  crossover operator is set at 0.35 according to Herrera et al.s  paper [14] and the set of minimum support values is {3%,  4%, , 13%}. The experiments were first made for  demonstrating the evolution of the Pareto fronts by the  proposed approach. The evolution of the Pareto fronts of  chromosomes in the archive along with different generations  by the proposed approach is shown in Fig. 1.

From Fig. 1, we can observe that the solutions were  distributed on the Pareto fronts and the final solutions after  500 generations were better than those in different  generations. Besides, we can also found that the derived  solutions on a Pareto front are trade-offs between the two  objectives. It thus depends on the user preference to decide  which solutions on a Pareto front are desired. The experiment  was then made for comparing the final Pareto front of  chromosomes in the archive of the proposed approach with  the previous approach [2], and is shown in Fig. 2.

Comparison results of final Pareto fronts between the proposed  approach and the previous approach    From Fig. 2, it is easily to know that the Pareto front  derived by using the proposed approach is better than the  previous one.  From the experimental results, we thus can  conclude that the proposed approach is not only effective in  finding an appropriate set of solutions, but also can provide  different options to users for further analysis.



VI. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS  The SPEA2 adopted a fine-grained fitness assignment  strategy, a density estimation technique, and an enhanced  archive truncation method to derive better Pareto solutions  [25]. In this paper, we have utilized it to propose a more  sophisticated multi-objective approach to find the appropriate  sets of membership functions for fuzzy data mining. Two  objective functions are used to find the Pareto front. They are  minimizing the suitability of membership functions and  maximizing the total number of large 1-itemsets,  respectively.

Experiments on a simulation dataset were also made to    show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results  show that the proposed approach is effective in finding an  appropriate set of solutions. Further, the experiments also  show that the proposed approach can derive better Pareto  front than the previous one [2]. In the future, we will  continuously enhance the multi-objective genetic-fuzzy  approach for more complex problems.
