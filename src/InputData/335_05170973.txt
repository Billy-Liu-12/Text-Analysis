Research on Early-Warning Model of Students? Academic Records Based on  Association Rules

Abstract   Association Rules is an important research  direction of data mining. Its study is mostly concentrated on improving algorithm efficiency presently, but neglects users? understanding and participating in excavating course. Students? historical academic records stored in university's educational administration systems was taken as data source, the paper established interactive visible mining model based on classical association rules, and introduced objective interest degree and subjective interest degree. Experiment results show that model built was feasible and meaningful; it could help us improve teaching management and personnel trainings? quality.

1. Introduction   The research of association rules reflects frequent patterns, connection, relevance or causal relations between itemsets, it finds special and valuable knowledge hidden in database [1]. At present its study is mostly for improving the algorithm efficiency [2], or carrying improvement on original algorithm, but neglects users? understanding and participating in the excavating course, and it is often very difficult for users to find out one's own rules cared about from a large number of rules excavated, thus analyze or utilize these rules becomes very difficult. In addition, human- computer interaction interface mode that some data excavate application software offers is too monotonous, especially the excavating course jumps too fast, makes users unable to understand the excavating results well [3].

To overcome weaknesses mentioned above, carry on early-warning analysis of student's achievement systematically, and improve teaching management, the  paper designed and established interactive visible mining model of achievement.

2. Design of the early-warning model   The early-warning model of students? academic records established was divided into three stages: training stage, test stage and early- warning stage, shown as Figure 1.

Figure 1. Early-warning model   Training Stage: Accept students? academic records  as training data, as well as restraint parameters which were set up by users (including support, confidence, and objective interest), finally output early-warning rules;  Test Stage: Input test data of students? academic records and test the accuracy rate of the early-warning rules produced in training stage. According to the level of the rate of accuracy, users judge to return to the training stage for re-export rules, or enter the next step;  Early-warning Stage: Introduce subjective interest degree, users choose courses that needed to be warned, system selected out corresponding rules, released early-warning information. Moreover, early-warning information used specific subject name to replace the code in the training stage, even ordinary users can understand.

2009 World Congress on Computer Science and Information Engineering  DOI 10.1109/CSIE.2009.282   2009 World Congress on Computer Science and Information Engineering  DOI 10.1109/CSIE.2009.282     3. Realizing of early-warning model  3.1 Data preconditioning   Before entering excavation, carrying on the preconditioning of data was needed at first. In the system, it needed to pay special attention to two respects below:  1. Independent data For some data not interested or not related to the  theme, to be removed, otherwise they would affect the accuracy of model.

2. Noisy data Training data and test data may have incorrect data,  and would have interference with the early-warning rules, needing to amend the property values before data mining.

According to the paper?s specific conditions, training data and test data of students? academic records both need to be changed into the necessary form before excavation. The research of the association rules mostly regards trade database as target at present, its property value is limited to Boolean. The attribute of achievement database is mainly number value attribute (Hundred-mark system) and classification attributes (Five-grade marking system, etc.). For this reason, the attribute in relational database should be changed. The paper divided sectors, changed classification attribute into number value attribute, and divided number value into several blocks. Generally speaking, this kind of conversion would go through students? academic records? loss and processing of academic records, conversion of points, data discrete, data integration and transformation, and other steps.

The processing mode was shown as follows: The original data set was students? academic  records of two classes, stored in EXCEL form, copied from school?s teaching educational system. Because of the privacy of data, the system failed to obtain students? name field, and expressed them by the serial number directly. Lead information of students? academic records into SQL SERVER 2000, use ADO technology to join database in the development platform.

To strengthen convenience and practicability of the model, this system gave up using SQL language to realize the division of students? academic records, but chose to realize it in code in programs. This system divided academic records into three blocks, 0-75 (L), 76-85(M), 86-100(H).

3.2 Realizing of modules   3.2.1 Training stage   The process of producing frequent itemsets adopted classical Apriori algorithm, as key of this system, its main procedure is shown as Figure 2.

Figure 2.  Flow chart of Apriori algorithm   After receiving the frequent itemsets and  corresponding support degree by Apriori algorithm, the general algorithm of producing association rules is: 1. Produce none empty subsets of each Lk.

2. X is one none empty subset of Lk, calculate Confidence (X) ,If Confidence(X)?minconfidence? then?X=>(LK-X)?.

Property: If itemset X is a frequent itemset, then all of its non-empty subsets are frequent itemsets.

According to this property, the paper improved the process, and omitted the first step of producing non- empty subsets.

Confidence? [NX])rgeItem[X]support(La  [NK])rgeItem[K]support(La  X?(0-(N-1))                                (1) The concrete realization codes were as follows:  Input: Frequent Itemsets, corresponding support count, minconfidence Output: strong association rules     (1) For all itemset LargeItem[K][NK]?LK  DO //K?(1-FreqItemk)  (2) For each itemset LargeItem[X][NX-1]?L0-LK-1 DO                                               //X?(0-(k-1)) (3) If (LargeItem[K][NK].find?LargeItem[X][NX- 1]!= -1 )THEN (4) If Confidence(x)?minconfidence  THEN (5) add  LargeItem[X][NX-1] to QgzItem1[], LargeItem[K][NK] to QgzItem2[] (6) END (7) Return QgzItem1[],QgzItem2[]  The algorithms of producing strong rules used in this paper prevented from producing non-empty subsets, and circulation finding out non-empty subsets? corresponding support. The algorithm adopted and used two dimension groups to store the frequent itemsets and corresponding support degree, after confirmed LargeItem [X][NX-1] as the subset of LargeItem [K][NK], leaded out support degree directly.

Efficiency is relatively high, simple to realize.

But the practical application of data mining system has gradually exposed its limitations based on evaluation criteria of support- confidence. In practical applications it may mislead sometimes, and produce meaningless rules. To avoid misleading rules, early- warning model adopted restraint after the bound, introduced restraint of objective interest degree.

The measure on whether a rule is objective interesting, a most commonly used method is analyzing the relevance of rules. Statistics has studied thoroughly about the relevance between data sets? variables, and most of the objective interest degrees have adopted the research results of statistics  To measure objective interest of association rules, there are several ways, such as Gini index, PS (Piatetsky-Shapiro of rules? interest) , Conviction, and so on. The method used in this paper to measure objective interest of association rules is RI (the objective interest of association rules X => Y) [4].

RI=  }support(Y)Y),ence(Xmax{confid support(Y)-Y)(Xconfidence  => =>       (2)   RI value lies between -1 and 1.If a rule?s interest  degree is greater than 0, and the more it approaches 1, its actual value is greater.

The digging module? concrete processes are shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3.  Digging out early-warning rules   In this course, frequent itemsets, strong rules, rules based on RI are all visual. If a user is not satisfied with the results of excavation, it can return to the interface of parameters? setting to amend parameters, it may go on several times, until getting satisfied results. The early-warning model also allows users don?t set parameters value, system produces rules according to default parameter value.

3.2.2 Early-warning rate of accuracy in test stage   Suppose Dtraning is the set of training data, Dtest is the set of test data, R={r1?r2???rn}is the early- warning rules based on interest degree.

Define: The early warning rate of accuracy of rule r(X=>Y) is PR (r), the early warning rate of accuracy of rules R is PR (R).

PR(r)= }DTest  TT, X:T {  DTest} TT, Y X:{T ??  ???  *100%          (3)  PR(R)=(? ?Rr  rPR )( }/R                            (4)   3.2.3 Introduce subjectivity interest degree in earning-warning stage   If only choosing users? concerned rules according to interest degree of objectivity, it is difficult to obtain rules that users are really interested in. Whether a rule is a useful, it depends on users. This is subjectivity of interest degree. In practical application, rules excavated may lose their subjectivity of interest because of the following reasons.

(1) The rules excavated may accord with priori knowledge or expected value.

For example, rules about students? selected lessons in students' database of selecting lesson. May excavate the following rules out:  Neural network (Required course)=>C language designs program (Required course)  The rule expresses students who have selected course " neural network " ,then he/she will select" C language designs program ". But this rule is not interesting, because ?C language designs program? as     required course is necessarily study, this is general knowledge, the rule is nonsensical.

(2) The rules excavated may involve non- interesting attribute or attribute association  For example, rule excavated out: Data Structure =>Dispersed Mathematics.

If users are not interested in rules related to ?Data Structure?, then the rule is nonsensical.

(3) The redundant rules.

Data Structure =>Dispersed Mathematics Data Structure, Advanced Algebra =>Dispersed  Mathematics Then to the rule (Data Structure =>Dispersed  Mathematics), rule (Data Structure, Advanced Algebra =>Dispersed Mathematics) is redundant.

The paper directed against the second situation especially: "The rules excavated may involve non- interesting attribute or attribute association ", introduced template match method and excavated association rules that users were interested in. Divide association rules into two kinds, interesting ones and non-interesting ones. The template is similar to ?A1,A2,A3```=>a1,a2,a3```?, if ?B1,B2,B3```=>b1,b2,b3``` ?is  one embodiment of the template, then call rule ?B1,B2,B3```=>b1,b2,b3``` ?match the template.

Match method used was checking whether the antecedent and consequent of rules include early- warning course, for example if having chosen course P1, P2, following templates wait to match:  P1,* =>*;  *=>P1,*;  P2,* =>*; *=>P2, * (* represent courses or any combination of  courses) This paper took the method of matching in proper  order progressively, to raise efficiency and avoid leading out rules repeatedly. For rules imported , match templates described above one by one, if match fail, then continue to match next, if succeed ,then lead the rules out, enter the next match of rules.

4. Results and analysis   The software environment was as followed: operating system was Windows XP, SQL Server2000 as database, VC 6.0 as development platform, C ++ as development language.

Collect scores of two classes? students, scores of class one were regarded as training data , scores of class two were regarded as test data, choose early- warning courses finally, and output early-warning information.

4.1 Rate of accuracy   Set up minsupport 0.2,0.25,0.3 and 0.35 respectively, minconfidence 0.7,0.8,0.9 respectively, and objective interest RI greater than 0. Table 1 lists amount of strong rules and rules based on RI. We can find out that the lower of minsupp and minconf, the amount of strong rules and rules based on RI is more, the knowledge amount excavated out is larger. And as the increasing of minsupp or minconf, the proportion of insignificant rules appears to reduce relatively.

Table 1. Comparison of the rules? amount  min sup  minconf=0.7 minconf=0.8 minconf=0.9  Stro ng  rules  rules based on RI  Stro ng  rules  rules based on RI  Stro ng  rules  rules based on RI  0.2 38 21 23 12 5 5  0.25 28 16 21 10 4 4  0.3 26 15 19 9 4 4  0.35 17 9 13 6 3 3   accuracy%   0.7 0.8 0.9 0.95 confidence  0.2  0.25  0.3  0.35   Figure 4. Rate of accuracy   From Figure 4, we can find out that model  established can be up to more than 70% of accuracy rate on realistic data source; at most it can achieve 92% when parameters were set up rationally. With the increasing of confidence degree, the overall of early- warning accuracy rate was an upward trend. The influence of support degree was not so obvious, and in the confidence level of 0.9, the relation of support and rate of accuracy trends inverse.

4.2 Analysis of interest degree   Set up minsupport =0.2, minconfidence =0.7, RI> 0.55, and choose all courses as at early-warning stage, and produce early- warning information as followed.

Figure 5.  Early-warning information     Here specially analyze rule of 0.6 interest degree, although both of the achievements of Advanced Algebra and Higher Mathematics were low, the achievement of ideological moral cultivation was high instead, though this rule?s support and confidence was relatively low, but objective interest of the antecedent and consequent of rules, namely correlation was particularly high.

According to the definition of objective interest degree (RI), if RI is higher, then its actual value is higher.

Compared with other rules, this rule seems more abnormal, but combine the knowledge of the educational field, it?s easy to know that because most students' discipline advantages are laid particular on some directions, and students who are good at Higher Mathematics and Higher Mathematics, his/her abilities of logic and reasoning must be very strong, and ideological moral cultivation as a subject of arts, requires relatively high ability of language expression, memory, etc., but most students are unable to be good at Arts and Science at the same time.

4.3 Rules of high rate of accuracy   Set up minsupport =0.2, minconfidence =0.95, RI> 0, from Table 1 we can know that the amount of early-warning rules is 2, the early-warning rate of accuracy is 91.9%, and choose all courses at early- warning stage, Figure 6 reveals the early-warning information produced finally.

Figure 6.  Early-warning information   Support degree of these two rules is in the middle  level, but confidence degree is up to 100%, and its objective interest degree is relatively high too, up to 26.7%. The first rule: if achievements of Higher Mathematics and Introduction to Computer Science were all very high, then achievement of Advanced Algebra would be high. This may because they have similarity in thinking mode. The second rule: if achievement of ideological moral cultivation was very  high, then this student?s Advanced Algebra achievement would be very low probably. This rule was similar with the rule (Higher Mathematics, L AND Advanced Algebra, L=> Introduction to Computer Science, H) above; it was also an abnormal rule of the same property. Though Arts and Science have greatly different ways of thinking, students' study advantages are laid particular on some directions, but if its confidence degree is up to 100%, we should pay special attention, teachers should especially remind students to pay attention to the unity of Arts and Science.

But we have also found that rules excavated out were kinds of statistics meaning in experiment, sometimes not obviously relevant courses of learning content had stronger relation, this kind of rules can also make fine early-warning results when applying to the real data. Analyze its reason; it is probably because that these courses are similar in such aspects as study modes, study way, learning method, etc..

5. Conclusion   Realizing early-waning model and digging out information of students? academic records is feasible and meaningful, it could help us strengthen the guidance in the teaching course, improve teaching quality, and offer sufficient basis for students to adjust study plan and allocate study time. There are many questions of this kind in practical application, so the method discussed will have more extensive practical meanings.
