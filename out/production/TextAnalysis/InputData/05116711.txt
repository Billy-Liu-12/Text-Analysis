Hierarchical Disaster Tolerant Architecture Based on Virtual Storage Technology

Abstract ? After 911 event happened in USA, there are in- creasingly companies beginning to take care of disaster tole r- ance. Great deals of companies pay huge money to construct disaster tolerant architecture. But this scheme is just suitable for big enterprise. That?s too expensive and inconvenient. In few years ago, there is a new way to store mass data called virtual storage. This could use the exited resource completely, and make it easy to construct the disaster tolerant architecture.

According to the features of virtual storage technology and actual requirement of disaster tolerant system, and after ana- lyzing the disadvantages of the traditional disaster tolerant architecture, this paper designed a hierarchical disaster tole- rant architecture based on virtual storage technology. And then it made particular study on its working mechanism and realizable disaster tolerant function. This architecture used the transparence of virtual mapping and flexibility of virtual sto- rage architecture. This makes a great improvement on the reliability of disaster tolerant system and enhances the flexibil- ity of disaster tolerant strength adjustment.

I. INTRODUCTION Along with advent of information-based age, the status  of data is becoming increasing important in information sys- tem. It?s already being the life and soul of entire information system. And data disaster tolerance has being the basis of system and application disaster tolerance. The destruction and un-recoverability of data will induce the fail of the entire disaster tolerance. In this case, the storage technology is going to be the basis of establishing disaster tolerant system.

The storage technology has gone through the development course of single tape, disk, tape library, RAID and storage network system. The disaster tolerant ability of the system has being enhanced continuously along with the develop- ment of storage technology. But different kinds of storage architecture made it complicated and costly to establish dis- aster tolerant system, moreover, single storage technology hasn?t satisfied the requirement of disaster tolerant ability to different industry. In face of this problem, researcher is be- coming to focus on virtual storage technology. It?s simplify the establish process to use advantage of virtual storage technology, and enhance the efficiency of disaster tolerance consequently. However, there are some obvious differences between traditional disaster tolerant architecture and virtual  storage architecture. This limits its application in disaster tolerant system a certain extent, and makes its advantage do not represent sufficiently in disaster tolerant system.

In view of this situation, after analyzing the disadvantage of traditional disaster tolerant system, this paper designs a hierarchical disaster tolerant architecture based on virtual storage technology. This architecture could adjust disaster tolerant strength, and enhance the reliability of disaster tole- rant server greatly.



II. RELATED WORK  A. Local Disaster Tolerant Architecture In early days, disaster tolerant architecture is localized in  a small area. We usually called it local disaster tolerant ar- chitecture. This just has local data backup centre and local backup server system. The inside of dashed wire frame in Figure 1 is a typical local disaster tolerant system. This dis- aster tolerant architecture could just tolerate single point failure such as hardware destroying. It doesn?t have ability to conquer large-scale disaster such as building collapse and earthquake.

Traditional Disaster Tolerant Architecture  B. Remote Disaster Tolerant Architecture Along with the increasing of people?s requirement of  disaster tolerant strength, remote disaster tolerant architec- ture appeared. It constructs remote backup application sys- tem and remote data backup centre. How large disaster that system could tolerate based on the distance between remote backup centre and local system. If the distance is within one hundred kilometers, it could tolerate fire or collapsing of building. If the distance is attained hundreds of kilometers, it could tolerate the large-scale disaster as earthquake or flood[1]. However, this architecture would reduce the speed of data recovery. The efficiency is low in face of small-scale recovery from the failure.

Both Side Disaster Tolerant Architecture In order to conquer the problem, paper [2] proposed a  disaster tolerant architecture that let the local and remote disaster tolerant system cooperate together. The architecture shown in figure 1, local and remote disaster tolerant control centre both provide serve for users. This architecture makes an effective balance between disaster tolerant strength and disaster tolerant efficiency. But this disaster tolerant archi- tecture is a structure of ?two point and one line?. The control centre would have problem of one point failure. It?s the bot- tom-neck of entire disaster tolerant system.



III. DESIGN OF DISASTER TOLERANT ARCHITECTURE In view of this problem, this paper designed a hierarchic-  al disaster tolerant architecture based on virtual storage tech- nology. The architecture used hierarchical structure to con- struct a view of entire disaster tolerance and virtual storage.

This makes a full use of flexibility of virtual storage archi- tecture and transparent of virtual storage mapping in disaster tolerant system. This section makes a brief summarize of virtual storage architecture firstly, and then described the disaster tolerant architecture that we deigned detailedly.

A. Virtual Storage Architecture Whereas industry group doesn?t have the virtual storage  standard, they usually provide solve project of virtual sto- rage based on their own kernel technology. From the struc- ture of virtual product that already proposed, we can divide virtual storage technology into three levers: virtual storage based on host, virtual storage based on device and virtual storage based on network[3].

virtual storage based on host is implemented by software and made a uniform management about disk and tape device which is handed directly by server. This manner of virtuali- zation is easy to implement. Thus it?s has an abroad applica- tion. But the area of virtualization is limited and the server is the single failure point.

Virtual storage based on device is aimed at constructing virtual device. It is familiar with virtual storage based on host in function. The difference is that its virtual manage- ment module embeds into hardware. For instance, RAID is the typical virtual device. This virtualization has a great per- formance, and it is transparent for manager and user. But it?s depended on special storage device and has a low extensibil- ity.

Virtual storage based on network implement based on network and managed the resource through constructing management node by virtual management software. Based on the difference of implement position of virtual manage- ment software, it can subdivide into four levels: LAN virtual storage based on applied server, LAN virtual storage based on special server, LAN virtual storage based on storage rou- ter and WAN virtual storage based on storage serve agent.

Virtual storage based on network is the most meaningful virtual storage. WAN virtual storage has a good extensibility and enhances the utilization ratio of resource.

B. Hierarchical Disaster Tolerant Architecture From 3.1 section, we knows that WAN virtual storage  based on storage serve agent could be constructed flexibly, it?s used the exited resource farthest. Due to the architecture that we designed used the constructing manner of WAN virtual storage architecture, it constructed on exited network architecture.  Shown In figure 3, the disaster tolerant server is the control node in network. And the node among each other becomes a hierarchical structure.

Hierarchical Disaster Tolerant Architecture  There are three key points to construct the disaster tole- rant architecture: First is the selection of disaster tolerant server management node. Second is the management be- tween disaster tolerant servers. Third is the construction of virtual logical view. We descript the three key points as fol- lowed.

1. The selection of disaster tolerant server management node  a) The device of server, client and etc. are divided by IP subnet partition theory. The size of grouping could divide by user-defined requirement.

b) Each disaster tolerant server management node and client is managed according to tree form data structure shown in Figure 4. After selecting the first grade disaster tolerant server, it positions the second grade to N grade dis- aster tolerant server by the management relationship be- tween disaster tolerant servers.

Figure 3.  Disaster Tolerant Management Structure with Tree Form  The node that be selected are formed like a forest struc- ture that composed by those tree structure. The number of     node and the relationship between nodes could adjust flexi- bly.

2. The management between disaster tolerant servers  a) Each disaster tolerant server manages client that is connected with it directly in the same connector. And it pro- vide disaster tolerant serve to these clients.

b) Superior disaster tolerant server backup and store the disaster tolerant metadata of junior disaster tolerant server.

c) Every first grade disaster tolerant server selects another first grade disaster tolerant server to be its disaster tolerant metadata?s backup copy station.

d) It designs that how many backup copies of current grade disaster tolerant metadata and how far the backup copy away from current grade disaster tolerant server based on requirement of disaster tolerant strength.

3. The construction of virtual logical view  a) Each disaster tolerant server implements the virtual mapping for device that is connected with it directly and provides virtual serve for client that is connected with it di- rectly in the same connector.

b) Disaster tolerant server creates a virtual volume to the client that is managed by it. From user?s point of view, data backup would always store on virtual volume. The actual storage position of data is transparent for them.

c) Superior disaster tolerant server backup and store the virtual storage metadata of junior disaster tolerant server.

d) Every first grade disaster tolerant server selects another first grade disaster tolerant server to be its virtual storage metadata?s backup copy station.

The disaster tolerant architecture based on this construc- tion manner has these characteristic as followed:  1. Transparence of disaster tolerant service: In disaster tolerant server, the disaster tolerant implement based on vir- tual mapping. It enhances the transparence of system main- tenance and application.

2. Intelligence of disaster tolerant management: The En- tire architecture is a hierarchical structure. It could adjust disaster tolerant distant flexibly by requirement. Then it im- plements different level?s disaster tolerant strength.

3. Simplification of mapping maintenance: The hierar- chical storage mapping structure reduces the implement complexity of virtual mapping and makes the virtual storage metadata easy to maintain.

4. Multipoint of system hot backup: multi-backup copy of disaster tolerant and virtual storage metadata improve the reliability of disaster tolerant server. If the disaster happened, it has relevant server to take over.



IV. IMPLEMENT OF DISASTER TOLERANT FUNCTION Disaster tolerant system based on the architecture that is  proposed in this paper has another two more functions than traditional disaster tolerant system.

A. Remote Multipoint Hot Backup for Server In traditional disaster tolerant architecture, disaster tole-  rant system which is the control centre would have the prob-  lem of single point failure. Then it would influent the relia- bility of entire system[4]. And in the disaster tolerant archi- tecture that we designed, superior server would take over junior server, and first grade server would be taken over by another appointed server. Each server in this paper has the same basic function and has the relevant backup copy of disaster tolerant, the switch operation is quite easy.

Look up relative metadata of under-grade server  Create virtual volume for client based on metadata  Detecte in time  Is there any backup performed  Delete virtual volume  Transfer backup data and relative metadata to under-grade server  Detecte in time  Begin  Finish  Give the control back to original server  Have  Haven t  Connect  Not Connect  Not Connect  Connect  Detecte times N  No  Reconstruct user s backup data based on disaster tolerant and virtual storage metadata  Inform client about data losing  Detecte times N  Yes  Yes  No   Figure 4.  the Flow of Hot Backup Switch  A whole switch process is shown in figure 5, superior server uses detection point technology to monitor junior server. If junior server doesn?t respond, superior server creates virtual volume for client that is controlled by junior server based on relevant metadata and keep monitoring the state of junior server. If junior server responds in appointed time, superior server will considered that it just has some temporary failure and doesn?t have any data losing. Then superior server deletes the virtual volume that created for the client. If client has some backup requests in this period, su- perior server transfers the backup data and relevant metadata back to junior server. At last, it gives the control power back to junior server. However, junior server doesn?t respond in appointed time, superior server will considered that junior server is destroy and it has data losing. Then, superior server reconstructs backup data of client based on relevant metada- ta, and informs the client about the situation of data losing.

This will reduce the data losing quantity(just losing the data that lost both at client and server). The switch between first grade servers is similar with the switch superior server and junior server.

B. Flexible Adjust of Disaster Tolerant Strength In traditional disaster tolerant architecture, the distant be-  tween local application system and remote backup system is decided. Thus, the disaster that it could tolerate is fixed.

When the disaster tolerant requirement of local application system is changed, it can?t adjust. The disaster tolerant archi- tecture that is proposed in this paper could change the disas- ter tolerant strength by changing the disaster tolerant strength label.

We divide the application system into four levels by im- portant degree: there are general, important, very important and most important. The level designs the disaster tolerant strength of application system. So we called it disaster tole- rant strength label. Application system in different level will use different disaster tolerant policy. The corresponding be- tween disaster tolerant strength label and special disaster policy as followed:  General(GEN): Local server creates a volume for appli- cation and provides disaster tolerant service. The backup data store on local server. This disaster tolerant policy only implements short distant disaster tolerance.

Important(IM): Local server creates a volume for appli- cation and provides disaster tolerant service. Most backup data store on superior server. Local server is the cache of superior server to provide fast backup and recovery service for application system. This disaster tolerant policy imple- ments middle and long distant disaster tolerance.

Very Important(VIM): Local server creates a volume for application and provides disaster tolerant service. Most backup data store on first grade server. Local server is the cache of first grade server to provide fast backup and recov- ery service for application system. This disaster tolerant pol- icy implements long distant disaster tolerance.

Most backup data store on first grade server. Superior server is the cache of first grade server and local server is the cache of superior server. This policy guarantee the disaster tolerant distant and the entire backup and recovery speed is quite fast.

Figure 6 is the flow of disaster tolerant strength changing, it include three models: label receiving model, transform judging model and operation performing model. Label re- ceiving model sends the disaster tolerant strength label that is received by it into transform judging model, transform judging model touch off special operation(shown in table 1) based on comparison of label. After that operation perform- ing model execute the operation.

From the figure, we knows that when it need adjust dis- aster tolerant strength, it only create corresponding virtual volume, and delete the virtual volume that won?t be used.

After that, it transfers the relevant data. For instance, Origi- nal disaster tolerant strength label in client is VIM, and it needs reduce to IM. The local server requests first grade server to delete the relevant volume information and backup data. Then it requests superior server to create virtual vo- lume for client and transfer the backup data that store on  local server into superior server. This system based on vir- tual storage technology, the entire process of changing is transparent for application system.

V. CONCLUSION In view of the problem in exited disaster tolerant archi-  tecture, this paper designed a hierarchical disaster tolerant architecture based on virtual storage technology and made a particular description about disaster tolerant function based on this architecture. The characteristic of this architecture as followed: First of all, the architecture used exited network architecture. This enhances the utilization ratio of resource and reduces the difficult of constructing the disaster tolerant system. Next, the architecture based on hierarchical structure.

This could implement different level of disaster tolerant strength. Last, the application of virtual storage technology in disaster tolerant system masking the influence of bottom adjustment for user. However, we do not make deep research about the configuration of each level disaster tolerant system.

This may make some server becoming the bottom-neck of system performance. It?s the problem that we should solve in the future.
