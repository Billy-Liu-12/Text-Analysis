A Big Data Driven Model for Taxi Drivers? Airport  Pick-up Decisions in New York City

Abstract? Taxis play a vital role in airport ground  transportation in terms of local and regional accessibility to and from the city. Taxi drivers? decisions to make airport trips are one of the most important factors that maintain taxi demand and supply equilibrium at the airports. In this paper, a large taxi trip dataset is used to model New York City taxi drivers? decision process in order to suggest policies for improving John F.

Kennedy (JFK) Airport ground access and passenger satisfaction. For this purpose, sequential taxi trips of drivers are identified, and the binary decision of ?airport pick-up? or ?cruising for customers? at the end of each trip is modeled using logistic regression. The model provides an important tool which can be used to suggest and assess policy recommendations for improving taxi operations at JFK. Considering the increasing availability of taxi trip records in the world, the suggested methodology can also be applied elsewhere.

I. INTRODUCTION Airports serve as both national and international connection  points for cities and provide economic benefits to the region around them [1]. It is shown that accessibility may affect travelers? airport decision among competing airports in a region [2]. Taxis? share of airport travel ranges between 6% up to 35% for major airports in the U.S., the U.K. and Japan. In New York City (NYC), taxis carry 35% and 23% of all airport bound passengers to LaGuardia (LGA) and John F. Kennedy airports respectively [3]. In these respects, taxis play a vital role in airport ground transportation in terms of accessibility to and from the city.

Taxicab industry is one of the heavily regulated businesses in the world. Taxi regulations for the airports in particular vary considerably from city to city. In some cities, any taxicab can drop-off passengers at the airport but not all taxis are allowed to pick-up airport passengers. This type of contract is called exclusive contract as opposed to the open system where any taxicab can drop-off or pick-up at the airport [4] [5]. These taxi?s regulations can vary also for the different airports of the same city. Based on the attractiveness of airport pickups for drivers, some airports also charge a fee to support the airport operations [6]. The attractiveness of an airport to taxi drivers can depend on many factors including the airport passenger volume, distance to the city center, fare structure, and potential driver revenue outside of airport. As discussed in Santani et al.

[7] the demand for taxicab at the airport and at the city affects each other. For example, it was found that during inclement weather, taxis make frequent short trips at Manhattan in NYC [8]. This increases driver income and makes flat-fare for an  airport pick-up, which otherwise is found satisfactory by the drivers, less attractive. As a result, taxi shortages are reported during inclement weather conditions at JFK airport in NYC [9]. An opposite case is observed at Dallas Forth-Worth, Portland, and San Francisco airports where taxis mainly serve to the airport but they do not adequately serve the city [10][11].

Examples of taxi supply excess [1][13][14] and shortage [15][10][11][16][17][14] regardless of the contract type  can be found around the world airports. Increasing the taxi supply can be discussed as a straightforward solution. However, any change in taxicab regulations is politically challenging due to multiple stakeholders, and more importantly increasing taxi supply does not guarantee better service or satisfaction [18][19].

Due to varying taxi regulations among cities and airports, the policies for improved taxi operations may not be transferable between airports, or such transfers may require regulation changes. In case a policy/regulation is considered, there is lack of models to quantify the impacts. Understanding the existing taxi trip patterns can help create sound models and determine policies for improving the quality of airport ground access. In this sense, big urban datasets provide the opportunity to extract patterns of importance for use in planning and policy making. The aim of this paper is to model the taxi drivers? airport pick-up decision for JFK airport using a comprehensive taxi trip data to identify the airport trips in the city. The decision model is used to suggest policies to overcome the taxi shortage within the existing regulations. For this purpose, first, the consecutive taxi trips of the drivers are identified. For each passenger drop-off, the following trip origin is categorized as either JFK (which implies an airport pickup) based on GPS coordinates, or other non-airport, ?regular? pickup. Then binary logistic regression is used to model the drivers? decision to go to JFK for passenger pick-up and get a guaranteed flat fare, or keep on cruising in the city for a random fare. The model employs the drop-off location, time and date, weather conditions, drivers? anticipated monetary gain with airport pick-up, and some other additional variables as the independent variables. Considering the higher market penetration of GPS devices in for-hire vehicles, and increasing availability of taxi GPS data around the world, the proposed methodology can be applied elsewhere.

The outline of the paper is as follows. First the literature review on taxicabs? role in airport ground access is presented along with the specific taxi regulations in NYC and JFK.

Second, the details of data that was employed for the analysis, followed by the discussion of which factors were included in      the taxi driver decision model. Then the binary logistic regression results are presented. The model results are used to suggest policies to improve the taxi supply at JFK. Last, the conclusions are presented.



II. LITERATURE REVIEW Gelhausen [2] finds that accessibility of airports can affect  air travelers? airport choice among competing regional airports.

The taxicabs carry 39% of all airport bound passengers from Manhattan to NYC airports [3]. A 2002 survey reported 35% and 23% of air passengers arriving at LGA and JFK airports respectively utilized taxicab. The number of city bound taxis dispatched from JFK has also increased by 68% from 1996 to 2005 [3]. In 2010, close to 3 million taxis were dispatched from JFK and 37% of passengers leaving the airport (through commercial ground transportation or from paid parking areas) utilized taxicabs [9]. At the Logan International Airport (BOS), at Boston, and O?Hare International Airport (ORD) at Chicago, taxis carry 19% and 18% of passengers, respectively, ranking second most commonly chosen mode after private vehicles. At Hartsfield?Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL) at Atlanta, and Miami International Airport (MIA) in Florida, taxis rank third behind private and rental cars and carry 8% and 6% of passengers, respectively [20].  In the United Kingdom, the modal share of taxis at London Heathrow Airport (LHR), Manchester Airport (MAN), Newcastle Airport (NCL) and Bristol Airport (BRS) is 26.6%, 24%, 19% and 16% respectively [21]. At Hong Kong International Airport (HKG), taxi share is 13%, including 20% share for business travelers [22].

Santani [7] discuss that there is a conflict of interest between taxi passengers and taxi drivers in general. Desired low waiting times for passenger mostly imply excess taxi supply, which means low occupancy and low income for drivers. The demand at the airports and at the city are related.

The higher attractiveness of one compared to the other may result in excess or shortage of taxi supply at the airports.

Excess supply will benefit passengers with short waiting time, however 56% and 19% of airport managers state the circling of taxis due to excess supply as a problem of some degree and a serious problem, respectively [1]. On the other hand, [19] discuss that taxis have the highest passenger satisfaction mainly because of minimum taxi waiting time. Hence, taxi shortage resulting in high passenger waiting times may reduce the satisfaction/utilization of taxis and hurt airport?s competitiveness [1].

The literature reports various operational and policy solutions for both cases. For Madrid Airport in Spain, with inadequate taxi supply, coordination of radio taxis are suggested [13]. For Dallas Forth-Worth, incentives for taxi drivers to divert the excess taxi service from airport to the city are recommended [10]. Opposite to other examples in Europe, taxi deregulation in Dublin was shown to reduce the taxi shortages at Dublin Airport without causing congregation [16].

Meanwhile switching from the exclusive contract to the open system was not found to improve service quality at Honolulu International Airport in Hawaii [4]. Barrett [15] suggests introducing pre-booked taxi services at airports to increase service quality. Based on a survey of the ten largest U.S.

airports and five largest Florida airports, [14] lists three most commonly cited solutions as 1) ?separate agreements with individual taxicab companies in the event of a shortage?; 2) ?double loading passengers into taxicabs in the event of a shortage?, and 3) ?regulating which day certain taxicabs may access the airport to prevent an overabundance of taxicabs?.

Due to taxi regulations very few of the above suggestions can be implemented at JFK without a policy/regulation change.

Hence, taxi regulations in NYC and JFK are discussed below so that the JFK case can be understood and the transferability of suggested policies to other airports can also be identified.

A. NYC Taxi Regulations and JFK Taxi Operations The New York City?s medallion (yellow) taxicabs are  licensed and regulated by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). JFK is served by NYC medallion taxicabs and drivers can make passenger pickups at any time at the airport. Private taxi  services (black cars and livery cabs) cannot pick-up passengers in the terminal taxi areas, although they can be prearranged by individual passengers for pickup in the general arrivals areas. The taxicab drivers are independent entities who can choose to operate in any given area in the city at any given time of the day. The 13,237 medallion taxicabs on an average make about 477,000 taxi trips per day in the city carrying between 680,000 and 895,000 passengers daily [8]. Five per cent of these trips occur at the city airports and more than 85% of the trip origins and destinations are concentrated within the Manhattan borough [25]. The medallion taxicabs are only permitted to pick-up passengers who hail them on NYC streets while the other for- hire car services utilize pre-arrangement. The taxi supply in the city is not constant and has been observed to vary depending upon the day of the week (DoW) and time of the day (ToD) [8].

JFK airport is one of the busiest in the United States and is located in Queens, about 15 miles from midtown Manhattan.

At JFK, taxi passengers pay a flat rate ($45 + tolls) for trips to and from Manhattan and a metered fare to other destinations.

Reader should note that on September 2012, taxi fare structure in NYC was recently changed, charging $52 for Manhattan- JFK and also increasing the per-mile rate. In the current paper, the 2009 fare structure that was in effect for the collected data was used for the analysis.

Upon arriving at JFK, taxi drivers are first required to enter a Central Taxi Hold (CTH) where they have to wait before being dispatched to the terminals on a first-in-first-out (FIFO) basis. Data from the dispatch system at CTH shows that the daily taxi supply at JFK fluctuates considerably (6,500-10,000) in the observed sample with reported average of 8,000-8,500 cabs/day [23]. As discussed by Biggar [24] as a general rule, taxi fare structures should ensure that drivers are indifferent between customers such as having no incentives to refuse short journeys. In terms of JFK taxi operations, taxi drivers expect to earn the full Manhattan flat rate after waiting at CTH.  Since the NYC taxi regulations do not allow refusal of any customer, short distance and low revenue trips may function as a disincentive to make an airport trip. In order to maintain the attractiveness of the airport pick-up, terminal dispatchers can issue ?short return? tickets if the passengers? destination is in     Queens, Brooklyn or the Five Towns of Long Island. Drivers in possession of a valid ?short-return? ticket enter an expedited (shorter) queue for prioritized dispatching if they return to JFK within ninety minutes. In a pilot taxi stand program in Queens, the ?short return ticket? was valued about $25 [25].  Driver interviews reveal the expected average waiting time to be between 45 to 90 minutes [23]. A recent study by the authors [8] on the taxicab drivers? income in NYC shows that the drivers seek to maintain their incomes around $20-$25 per hour. Combined with drivers waiting time expectation, it can be said that drivers value the short return ticket directly based on the time (=revenue) they save by having it.



III. DATA Every medallion taxicab in New York City is mandated to  install a GPS device and all taxi trips are recorded in a database. In this paper, one month sample of taxi GPS data provided by New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) is used. The data includes all necessary fields such as pick-up/drop-off locations (latitude and longitude) and time stamps. The sample used in the current paper is the set of all taxi trips in April 2009, including 12.8 million taxi trips covering all time periods and days. In order to investigate the weather impacts, the weather conditions during each trip are also assigned by using the weather data gathered from the weather underground website. The weather data include information such as temperature, wind speed and direction, precipitation, etc. The weather information is updated at an hourly interval unless there is any change in weather condition.

Since the current paper focuses on the taxi driver decision to make an airport trip after each drop-off, the weather conditions at the end of each trip is assigned as the weather condition that would affect the taxi driver?s next trip decision. Given the impacts of rain on taxi ridership [8], the clear and rain categories are investigated in the current study. Weather underground website  categorizes the rain conditions as light rain, rain, and heavy rain based on the level of precipitation.

The weather conditions with no precipitation (e.g. overcast, partly cloudy) are also assumed ?clear?. Overall, the following categorization scheme is followed for the weather condition assignment for each trip:  Existing Categories     Assigned Categories Clear  Partly Cloudy Scattered Clouds Mostly Cloudy  Overcast Fog Haze  Clear  Light Rain Light Freezing Rain Light Rain  Rain Moderate Rain Heavy Rain Heavy Rain

IV. TAXI DRIVERS? AIRPORT PICK-UP DECISION MODEL  In the taxi trip data, there are two fields that allow us to identify trip sequences for the same taxi driver. The ?shift number? field represents the ?driver shift? which changes each time a different driver starts driving the taxi. For each shift number, the GPS data also has the ?trip number? field. The trip number is equal to one for the first trip in a particular shift and  increases by one for each consecutive trip. Thus, all the trips made by the same driver during her/his shift can be extracted sequentially. After each drop-off (nth trip), the taxi driver can either continue searching for a new customer, or go to the airport to seek a guaranteed fare. In other words, the decision for (n+1)th trip is based on the characteristics/conditions following the drop-off of the nth trip. Hence, the decision variable is a binary variable and the probability of an airport pick-up decision can be estimated with binary logistic regression model. Below, the independent variables that are used in the decision model are discussed. While determining the set of independent variables, the authors also considered the informal taxi driver interviews during previous JFK Airport taxi operation studies [9][23].

A. Time of Day, Day of Week, Weather Conditions Taxi drivers exhibit keen knowledge of the roadway traffic  conditions (including the roads connecting to the airport) as well as the peak flight arrival times at the airport. They do not, however, decide based on a single criterion, but based on a simultaneous assessment of both the traffic conditions and flight arrivals. For instance, the interviewed drivers ? independently  from each other ? had a consensus that although there could be high number of flight arrivals during the morning hours, it is not reasonable to go to airport after a certain time as the roadways to and from JFK get highly congested. In this sense, ToD and DoW variables can successfully represent the coupled impacts of flight arrival schedules and traffic congestion patterns. It was also shown that taxi drivers generally make more money during inclement weather conditions [8]. The weather conditions have influence on traffic congestion as well. To incorporate those variables into the decision model, the time/date and assigned weather condition at the end of each trip are used to extract the ToD, DoW, and weather information. The following ToD categories were used:  ? Early morning 5AM-7AM ? AM peak 7AM-10AM ? Off-peak 10AM-4PM ? PM peak 4PM-7PM ? Evening 7PM-12AM ? Night 12AM-5AM  Since the airport activity is minimal during ?Night? period, corresponding records were excluded from the decision model.

B. Expected Net Gain As discussed by [19][26], the profit expectation of a taxi  driver for picking up a customer from a particular zone affects her/his decision for search of customers. A real-life example would be the NYC taxi drivers? choice of staying at Manhattan during inclement weather due to higher anticipated income.

Once a taxicab picks a passenger from the airport, she/he serves the airport as well as the passenger. Medallion taxicab drivers are not obliged to serve at any particular place for any particular time. Ignoring their service to the passengers, taxi drivers are somewhat like any customer looking (cruising) for the most competitive price (higher anticipated fare) at the most attractive store (most lucrative locations). In this respect, JFK     provides a satisfactory fare for drivers however it is offset by the waiting at the CTH.

A driver?s gain is suggested to be defined as the profit per unit time to include both occupied and vacant taxi times [26].

For JFK case, although $45 flat fare to Manhattan is stated as a satisfactory amount by drivers, they have to wait at the CTH before being dispatched to the airport terminals. The average wait time at the CTH varies depending on the time of day as shown in Fig. 1.  Maximum waiting times of up to 148 minutes have been observed in the dataset with the maximum average waiting times observed during 3-5 AM  and 9-11 AM (~ 120 minutes).

Fig. 1 Average waiting times at JFK CTH by time of day  Instead of waiting at CTH, drivers could make money elsewhere in the city, hence choosing JFK Airport introduces an opportunity cost for drivers. To take this opportunity cost into account, net gains of drivers (as a function of ToD, DoW, and weather) are calculated as:    The average hourly driver incomes for different DoW, ToD and weather conditions are extracted from the data similar to Kamga et al. [8]. In order to calculate average waiting times, the taxi trips that have the consecutive drop-off and pick-up points at JFK are extracted from the data. The time in between the last drop-off and the pick-up is assigned as the waiting time for that particular DoW-ToD period. Overall, the net gain represents the revenue (or loss) of a driver for making a trip to the airport to pick-up passengers instead of cruising elsewhere for passengers. As explained previously, drivers with short return ticket can skip the CTH waiting queue. They are supposedly dispatched to the terminals shortly after other taxis already waiting in the short return queue. Since the short return ticket holders can return to the airport at any time before 90 minutes, their waiting times cannot be calculated. In this sense, 10 minutes of waiting time is assumed for all short return trips.

C. Location The majority of the taxi trips in NYC are confined to  Manhattan. The relatively distant location of JFK to Manhattan is also one of the reasons why drivers prefer to stay at Manhattan. On the other hand, once the drivers pick-up passengers to drop-off at Brooklyn or Queens, they are closer to JFK and can be more likely to go to the airport. Of course, going to JFK with a passenger is the best case as they get a relative good fare to go to the airport and they can (if they chose to join the queue at CTH) get the same relative good fare  on the way back to Manhattan. In order to quantify the impact of location on driver decision, the latitude and longitude of the drop-off point is used to extract the location where driver makes her/his decision regarding the next pick-up. Each drop- off location is categorized as one as shown below.

? JFK ? Manhattan ? Brooklyn ? Queens ? Bronx ? Home/Shift Change ? Other  Please note that although JFK is actually in Queens, the JFK has been assigned a location category to account for the impact of very close airport proximity. The explanation regarding the Home/Shift Change is provided below. The location category ?Other? includes all the trips to New Jersey, Staten Island, and further destination points. Since the ?Other? category has relatively very few trips, corresponding records was excluded from the decision model.

D. First Trip  As discussed previously, the decision at (n+1)th trip is based on the nth trip characteristics. Thus, there is no decision to make after the last trip in a shift as the driver ends her/his shift after the last drop-off. On the other hand, taxi drivers who live relatively close to the airport, or who start their shift at locations close to the airport may prefer to earn a high airport fare in their first trip [9]. It is crucial to understand the driver decision regarding their first pick-up location. In our one- month sample 8.5% of the first trips are pick-up at the airport, which correspond to 49.8% of the airport pick-ups are the first trips in corresponding shifts. The taxi GPS dataset only includes paid/occupied trips with a customer. Hence, the vacant trips between shift change and first pick-up are not recorded. In order to investigate taxi drivers? first pick-up decision, a vacant ?pseudo? trip is created for each first trip in a shift. Pesudo-trips are assumed to have no short return ticket.

Considering that vacant trips occur  - presumably - shortly before the first trip in a shift, DoW, ToD and weather conditions corresponding to the first trip pick-up time are assigned also for the vacant trip. Main issue arises with the ?location? variable as there is no way of knowing exactly where the driver started her/his shift. A New York City Department of Transportation study suggests that many drivers change shifts at Brooklyn or Queens around 4PM causing a temporary taxi shortage in Manhattan [27]. Meanwhile, it is also reported that drivers can individually arrange to change shifts in Manhattan as well. To overcome this concern, ?Home/Shift change? location category is defined only for vacant pseudo trips.

E. Short Return Ticket Short return ticket is an important incentive that helps  maintain the airport attractiveness. Drivers with short return ticket are more likely to return to the airport and make up for their income loss due to the previous short trip [9]. In order to incorporate the effect of short return ticket, each airport pick-    0-  A M  1-  A M  2-  A M  3-  A M  4-  A M  5-  A M  6-  A M  7-  A M  8-  A M  9-  A M  -1  1 ?  -1 2 ?  -1  P M  1-  PM 2-  PM  3-  PM 4-  PM  5-  PM 6-  PM  7-  PM 8-  PM  9-  P M  -1  1 ?  -1 2 ?  CT H  W ai  t Ti  m es   (M  in ut  es ]  Average CTH Waiting times     up decision after a trip that has the origin at the airport and destination at Brooklyn or Queens is assumed to have a short return ticket.

Regarding the above independent variables, choice of airport pick-up or regular street pick-up is modeled using binary logistic regression. The decision model results are presented below.



V. MODEL RESULTS The logistic regression is carried out using SPSS. The  model significance and parameters in the model are presented below.

TABLE I Model Summary  -2 Log likelihood Cox & Snell R Square Nagelkerke R Square  1108764.730a .036 .311  For logistic regression regular R-square values cannot be  defined and calculated. Thus, so called ?pseudo? R-square measures (namely Cox & Snell and Nagelkerke) are formulized. Nagelkerke R-square (a modified version of Cox&Snell R-square) ranges between 0 and 1 where values higher than 0.5 are assumed to imply good fit. The Nagelkerke R-square of 0.311 value for the presented model suggests a moderate fit. Another measure of goodness-of-fit often used to evaluate a logistic regression model is performed using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (Fig. 2). ROC curve is based on comparisons of ?true positive? (sensitivity) and ?true negative? (specificity) predictions of the logistic regression. The area under the ROC curve take values between 0.5 and 1.0, where larger area means better fit. The area is calculated as 0.884 with 95% confidence interval (TABLE II).

The area under the curve is significantly different from 0.5 (p- value is .000), which implies that logistic regression predictions are better than purely random predictions.

The significant variables are mostly no surprise to someone from the taxi industry, but the current study quantifies the impacts of these anticipated variables and provides the magnitude of their impacts for possible policy recommendations.

Logistic regression is based on a transformation of a linear probability model to remove range restrictions, and this transformation requires a different interpretation of the regression coefficients. Let the probability  be a linear function of covariates, e.g. ,  where  is the vector of covariates and  is a vector of regression coefficients. In order to restrict the probability to [0, 1] interval, first odds ratio is introduced: . Then logit transformation is carried  out . Hence, the probability range of [0, 1] is assured. Logistic regression is carried out by establishing  ,  where  is the probability of the binary outcome,  is the vector of covariates and  is a vector of regression coefficients. In this respect, individual coefficients estimate the change in the log odds for a unit change in . Hence, the coefficients ( ) are the logit coefficients and cannot be directly interpreted regarding their impacts on the outcome. Since  the odds ratio, , provides the necessary measure in logistic regression to assess the impact of unit change of a parameter in  on the probability of the decision outcome.

The odds ratios confirm the JFK officials? claim that drivers go to airport less during rain conditions. Similarly, drivers dropping passengers at the Bronx are found to be almost 7 times more likely to make an airport trip compared to a Manhattan drop-off. As expected, a JFK drop-off followed with a JFK pick-up has the highest odd ratio. Meanwhile, the results also confirm that drivers are more likely to go to JFK Airport for their first pick-up in their shifts.  Although the shift change locations reside in one of the NYC boroughs, the odds ratio for the shift change location is the second highest (48.7) after JFK.

Positive impacts of short return tickets were recognized by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) and similar ?short-return ticket? policy has also been implemented at the LGA airport. More, the short return time was recently expanded from 90 minutes to two hours at both the airports to provide more fare opportunities to the drivers [28]. Nevertheless the presented model quantifies the impact: The drivers with a short return ticket are 20 to 27 times more likely to go to the airport after their drop-off at Queens and Brooklyn. ToD and DoW are also found to be significant and to have an impact on airport pick-up probability. DoW impact is relatively smaller than ToD.

One interesting finding is the impact of ?net gain?. One might expect that increasing the fare (hence the net gain) would have a high impact on drivers decision. However, net gain has the lowest impact among all the significant parameters. This finding implies that fare increase for airport trips may not provide the desired increase in taxi supply at JFK. On one hand, a theoretical explanation to this low impact could be the computation of hourly driver revenues. The hourly revenues are calculated based on ToD, DoW, weather conditions, and CTH waiting time. In other words, ?net gain? parameter is highly correlated with other significant factors in the model, and may provide redundant information. On the other hand, drivers already assess the JFK flat fare as very  satisfactory based on authors? interviews with the drivers during previous studies [23][6][8]. The drivers major concerns in JFK taxi operations are not the fare amounts but the inefficiencies in dispatching, traffic congestion from/to Manhattan and so on. In this respect, the lower impact of an increase in already appreciated taxi fare may imply the presented model?s realism regarding drivers? decision process.

Meanwhile, the range of possible policies is relatively limited as the model variables can not necessarily be adjusted, i.e. DoW, ToD, weather. The odds ratio implies that a driver making a drop-off at Queens or Brooklyn is 15 to 21 times more likely to go to the airport for pick-up. However, such trips out of Manhattan do not take place unless a customer?s destination is not in Queens or Brooklyn. An intuitive regulation/policy solution of increasing fare is found to have negligible effect. The only model variables that can be used directly (without a regulation change) to suggest a policy is the short return ticket. The model results, on the other hand, allow us to identify the periods that taxi drivers would be the least likely to pick-up passengers from airports. Some additional policies can be proposed based on findings and the literature; however the implementation of such policies would require approval from multiple stakeholders.



VI. SUGGESTED POLICIES  A. Airport Pick-up ?Punch-card? As discussed above, drivers with a short return ticket are 20  to 27 times more likely to go to the airport after their drop-off at Queens and Brooklyn. However, short return tickets are only issued once a driver picks up a passenger who goes to destinations designated as short return eligible, i.e. Brooklyn, Queens. The data includes almost 21,000 short return eligible trips. The data also shows that 809,242 trips (6.4% of all taxi trips) have destinations in Brooklyn or Queens. Hence, given an incentive like short return ticket, the drivers picking up passengers at any location and dropping them off at Brooklyn and Queens could go to JFK and help relieve the taxi shortage.

Such an incentive has a high potential to attract drivers from Manhattan as well, however the impact cannot be quantified with the existing data.

A possible way to introduce an incentive is to let drivers skip the CTH waiting area and join the priority queue (just like the short return ticket holders) after they make certain number of airport pick-ups. This is very similar to punch-cards in coffee shops in which you get a free coffee after a predefined number of purchases, or airline reward programs in which you have a free flight after you reach certain miles-traveled. In this way, all the drivers will have the fair access to the reward and not only they will be more likely to go to the airport with their ?priority-queue? punch cards, they may also be more likely to go to the airport to get their cards punched. Punch cards can be printed, but better, they can also be virtual punch cards as offered for smart phones and used in many commercial industries. More, the PANYNJ has been in the process of testing a camera technology for plate recognition at the CTH at JFK [9]. Such camera systems can also be used to determine the number of trips made by a taxicab, however as a single taxi is used by multiple drivers, this can cause issues on which driver should benefit from the reward. Meanwhile, the taxi     shortages are not experienced at all times, hence the use of priority-queue punch reward can be allowed for time periods that taxis are needed the most. Overall, implementation of an airport pick-up reward program is relatively easy to implement and provides a flexible way to improve airport attractiveness.

B. Guidelines and Advanced Technologies for Efficient  Dispatching Short return tickets? attractiveness is solely based on the  time they help save time for the drivers. In this respect, any policy with the same time-saving target would increase the drivers? airport pick-up probability. The average hourly driver income is around $20-$25 [8]. Hence saving 15 minutes before be dispatched to a terminal is equal to more than $5 (~20% of average hourly revenue) for a driver. As discussed in Kamga et al. [23], there are inefficiencies in dispatching at JFK as the dispatchers are overwhelmed with multiple tasks simultaneously. For instance, the drivers complain about waiting at the terminals up to 20 minutes due to early dispatching. Some of these inefficiencies can be alleviated by standardizing the dispatching process based on guidelines.

Kamga et al. [6] surveys the airport dispatching technologies which also possess high potential to help dispatchers and increase the efficiency. The findings in the current paper shows that such advanced technologies should not be considered only as assistance for dispatchers, but also as an investment that increases the attractiveness of the airport for taxis, with long term impacts to increase passenger satisfaction and competitiveness of the airport. Such technology improvements require capital investment which needs to be justified in term of their benefits. The models similar to the one in the current paper may help to quantify the benefits with respect to the airport accessibility and attractiveness for taxis.

The use of the presented model goes beyond the policies derived directly from the model results. The model can aid to assess the impacts of other policy considerations. For instance, separate for-hire-vehicle agreement for taxi shortage periods is a possible (yet legally very complicated in NYC) suggestion.

Since the model includes the time of day impact on taxi drivers? airport pick-up decision, the periods that are suitable for such separate agreements can be identified. Taxis do not only serve as an airport ground access mode, but also help maintaining accessibility in metropolitan cities. As the taxi supply at a certain location is strongly related to taxi drivers? decision to cruise around that particular area, a meaningful decision model can help determine ways to increase transportation accessibility.



VII. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, a big taxi trip dataset was used to model New  York City taxi drivers? decision process in order to suggest policies for improving John F. Kennedy (JFK) Airport ground access and passenger satisfaction. For this purpose, sequential taxi trips of drivers were identified, and the ?airport pick-up? or ?cruising for customers? binary decision at the end of each trip was modeled using logistic regression. The developed model results confirmed several issues that were mentioned by taxi industry stakeholders based on their experiences. For instance, the results not only confirmed but also quantified the  negative impact of rain on taxi supply at JFK. Similarly, the positive impact of short return ticket policy was confirmed and quantified by the model results. Based on these promising findings, policies were suggested to address the taxi shortage problem at JFK airport.

Taxi drivers? decisions to make airport trips are one of the most important factors that maintain taxi demand and supply equilibrium at the airports. In this respect the current paper suggests a methodology to capture the drivers? decision mechanism. The decision model can be further used to evaluate the impacts of multiple policy recommendations. Considering the higher availability of similar taxi trip datasets, the methodology can be applied elsewhere as well.
