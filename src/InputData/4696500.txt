A Blind Associative Watermarking Technique using Self-Embedding

Abstract  Two techniques combining associative watermarking  and self-embedding are used to support the blind watermarking detection. The experimental result shows that the proposed method is robust. When the watermarked images suffered from various kinds of image-processing procedures, such as Gaussian noise and brightness, the existence of watermarks can be detected without the original image?s assistance.

1. Introduction   Due to the convenience of the Internet, this  application is multiplying through out digital media.

However, it is also becoming a hotbed for copyright invaders. Digital watermarking is a kind of technique commonly used to protect ownership and intellectual property. So far, many watermarking schemes [6] have been proposed to insert copyright information for claiming copyright protection.

For non-blind watermarking schemes, where the original image is available at the detector, the watermarked image may be registered against the original image to provide proper synchronization [5].

However, blind detection is more promising and useful once the availability of an original image can not be granted in real-world scenarios, blind watermarking techniques, is more useful [3] [4].

Recently, Shen et al. [6] proposed a new watermarking scheme based on the technique of association rules mining, which traditionally is applied in the field of data mining. Their watermarking scheme defines 4-itemset association rules for both the original image and the random- sequence-type watermark. They then exploit the association rules for the watermark and the original  image respectively. To examine the first three items of these two groups of association rules, they adjust the fourth item of the association rules of the original image when their first three items are closest to those of the watermark. Instead of directly hiding the random sequence watermark bitstreams into the original image, Shen et al. [6] embedded the watermark association rules into the association rules of the original image to successfully achieve the goal of protecting the image copyright.

For most watermark applications, it is often desired to retrieve or detect the embedded information without access to the original image, which is known as blind watermarking. However, Shen et al.?s watermarking scheme is not blind. Therefore, this paper will propose a blind watermarking technique to enhance Shen et al?s scheme. The experiment results show that the proposed method is robust even when the watermarked images suffered from various image- processing procedures, such as Gaussian noise and brightness. The embedded watermark still can be detected without the original image?s assistance.

2. Related works   In this section, we would concisely introduce some  basic techniques, such as association rules, DCT, JND, Edge Detection Method, and Masking Block Method.

2.1. Association Rules   Association rule mining algorithm, which discovers  correlations between frequent items in a transactional database D, was originally proposed by Agrawa in 1993[1]. sup( X Y? ) stands for the proportion of transactions in the data set D which contains the itemsets X and Y. The definition for rule?s confidence   DOI 10.1109/ISDA.2008.104     is as shown in Equation (1). If sup( X Y?  ) and conf(X?Y) are greater than user specified minimum support and minimum confidence, the rule X?Y is strong. Only strong rules can be considered as associational rules.

sup ( X Y? )=  || ||  D YX ? *100%,  conf(X?Y )= ( ) ( )  sup X Y sup X ? *100%.       (1)    2.2. JND (Just Noticeable Distortion)  A reasonable measure of image degradation should  be compatible with the human visual system (HVS).

Watson [8] has proposed a JND model based on the JPEG compression quantization matrix (QM) on image blocks. For each frequency coefficient, the JND model can find the JND value as follows:  )3(.||,max  )2(,)/(   ?? ?  ?? ?=  = ? ijw  ij  T  k ij  wk ij  k ij  k ij  ak ij  k ij  tctJND  cctt  In the Equations (2) and (3) above, Ta is a fixed value set as 0.649. k0c  represents the DC coefficient at the k  th block. 0c  is an average value of all DC values in the image,  ijt  is the value of element at the position (i, j)  of the JPEG quantization matrix, ijw  is a fixed value  set as 0.7, and kijc  is a coefficient value of the k th block  of the image. When the image has been altered by some image process, the change of coefficient values will not exceed the JND threshold, and thus the changes are imperceptible.

2.3. Shen et al. proposed method   Shen et al. [6] introduced a scheme using the  association rule of data-mining?s conception to do the watermarking detection. Their proposed watermark detection is showed to be robust. There are four item values extracted between the original image and watermark for generating association rules. Then, they exploited the association rules for the watermark and the original image respectively. To examine the first three items of these two groups of association rules, they adjusted the fourth item of the association rules of original image when the first three items are closest to those of watermark.  Although the method is very novelty, the original image is required to help the watermark detection. It?s not natural in the field of watermarking.

2.4. Edge detection based on masking blocks   Based on Sobel masks [2], Shen et al. [6] proposed  eight filter masks which can be used to detect blocks with edges in horizontal, vertical, 45?, 135?, 225?, and 315? directions. Fig. 1 represents the mask blocks for different edge detection.

The method [7] embedded the characteristic information of block at position (i, j) onto its corresponding masking block at position (p, q) via Equation (4) below.

D: the watermarking image.

W: the watermark image is a random sequence and  will be transformed by DCT. Afterward, assign all DC coefficient values as zeros. In addition, set all AC coefficient values to be -1 if the original AC coefficient values are negative, otherwise 1.

Q: the image block index, followed by the row-major order.

T: the threshold value, used to judge the existence of watermark.

C: the number of the sorted absolute AC coefficient values greater than the user specified threshold.

Vc: the C th AC coefficient value.

S: the similarity rate, which presents how many  coefficient values are hit among C coefficient values.

Masking blocks (numbered by 0~7)      4th items of association rule, the representatives for the Qth block of the original image I. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd items of association values of the blocks of images D and W are also defined likewise.

BLI(Q), BLW(Q) and BLD(Q): the Qth block of the image I, W and D, respectively, after DCT transformation.

The proposed method is composed of three procedures including the generation of association rules for images, watermark embedding; and watermark detection.

3.1. Association rules of image  Step1: Suppose image I is divided m*m blocks, and  each block has q*q pixel values. Each block is the size of q ? q pixels from images W and D after their blocks are divided.

Step2: Apply DCT transformation to every block in I and W, respectively.

Step3: Set b1I(Q) that is the average of AC coefficient values of BLI(Q). The 2nd item for the association rule is the maximum of eight masking filter values. The 3rd item represents the index of the masking filter which has the maximum masking filter value.

Step5: After applying the Equation (4), the position for masking block related to BLI(Q) can be obtained. That is, the fourth item B4I(Q) of the association rule is used to denote the position where the important characteristics of block Q will be embedded.

Step6: Sort m*m*(q*q-1) AC coefficient values of image I according to their absolute values in descending order.

Step7: For each block, keep the AC coefficient values unchanged if their absolute values are greater than Vc. Set those AC coefficient values whose absolute values are less than Vc as zeros.

Step8: For image I, we abandon those smooth blocks whose AC coefficient values are full of zeros.

For block Q, let ),(INX ii  I Q ?? ?for i =1, 2, ?,  kQ ?  stand for the non-zero AC coefficient value located at position ),( ii ?? .

In addition to the above eight steps, the first and second item values should be further quantified. The details can be referenced in [6].

3.2. Watermark embedding   The watermark embedding procedure is presented in  Fig. 2. From the above procedure, two association  rules RI={b1I(Q), b2I(Q), b3I(Q), b4I(Q), bLI(Q)} and RW={b1W(Q?), b2W(Q?), b3W(Q?), bLW(Q?)} are obtained.

Step 1: Blocks Q and Q? with RI and RW , respectively, are coupled with in the way of finding a pair  ),( WI rr , where II Rr ??  and WW Rr ??  such that the pair ),( WI rr  can minimize the result of Equation (5) [6].

Step 2: Use Equation (5) to align the coupled pair of ),( WI rr for embedding watermarking. When  ijI QBL )]([ ?0, equation (6) applies the JND technique to satisfy the semi-robust watermarking.

Step 3: For block Q, let the absolute of non-zero AC  coefficient value ),(INX ii ??IQ ?for i =1, 2, ?, kQ ?  stand for abs( ),(INX ii ??IQ ), which is transformed into its binary representation. Since the value of abs( ),(INX ii ??IQ ) is less than 1000, the binary representation is divided into HQ groups and each group contains ten bits which are in order embedded into the masking block located at the position b4I(Q) by performing parity bit replacement.

Step4: Finally, the watermarked image D is generated by performing IDCT.

Fig. 2. Watermark embedding flow chart       3.3. Watermark detection  Without loss of generality, each block of images D  and W is first transferred by DCT and then the corresponding association rules RD= {b1D(Q), b2D(Q), b3D(Q), b4D(Q), BLD(Q)} and RW={b1W(Q?), b2W(Q?), b3W(Q?), BLW(Q)}, respectively, are generated. Fig.3 shows the watermarking detection procedure.

Step 1: For coupling RD and RW, to find the coupled blocks Q? and Q of images W and D, respectively.

Step 2: Assume b4D(Q) is the position of masking block related to block Q in image D. For the DCT block BLD(Q) at position b4D(Q), kQ bits are gathered from the AC coefficient values  ),(INX ii ??DQ ?for i =1, 2, ?, kQ? at medium frequency band by performing the least significant bit of abs( ),(INX ii ??DQ ). Let s1, s2, s3, ?, QkS  be thes binary sequence, which are  transformed into HQ decimal numbers denoted as d1, d2, ?,  QH d .

Step 3: To determine if di ?for i =1, 2, ?, HQ? is positive or negative, we have to check the sign of value INXQ D  D (?i ,?i ) at position (?i, ?i).

Step 4: Identify all the values wi ?for i =1, 2, ?, kQ?at  position (?i, ?i) of block Q? in watermark W.

Step 5: Define a similarity criteria denoted as S, which  presents how many coefficient values for all blocks of D, I and W are hit among the C coefficient values as below.

CS /s)(?= , where   )7(  ;0and)(),( if1  ;0and)(),( if1  );,(),( if0  ;0and)(),( if1  ;0and)(),( if1  s  ?? ?  ?  ?? ?  ?  ?  ?? ?  ?  ?? ?  ?  ?  ><? <>?  = >> <<  =  wsdINX  wsdINX  INXINX  wsdINX  wsdINX  iii D Q  iii D Q  ii D Qii  D Q  iii D Q  iii D Q  d  d  dd  d  d  ?? ??  ???? ?? ??    Then use S to judge if there exists the watermark in a detected image D. If S ?T, then the watermark does not exist in the image D; otherwise, the watermark exists.

4. Experimental results   In our experiments, the original image is a 256?256  gray-scale image of Lena. The watermark image is 208 ? 208 pixels. The parameters are set as follows: M1 = 8, M2 = 8, C = 850, as well as the eight masking filters of edge detection are as shown in Fig. 1. Threshold T is set to be 0.5 which is used to judge the existence of watermark.

Our experimental results in Table 1 show the success of watermarking detection since the similarity values are all greater than the threshold T after several kinds of image-processing attacks as shown in Fig. 4.

Shen et al. [6] proposed a pretty creative scheme applying data mining to the field of watermarking detection. However, their scheme requires the original image in order to do the watermarking detection.

Therefore, the significant characteristics of the original image are extracted and hidden into the image itself to achieve the blindness.
