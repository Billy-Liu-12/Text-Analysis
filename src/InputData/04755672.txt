Re-Visiting the Knowledge Pyramid

Abstract The knowledge pyramid has been used for several  years to illustrate the hierarchical relationships between data, information, knowledge, and wisdom.

This paper posits that the knowledge pyramid is too basic and fails to represent reality and presents a revised knowledge pyramid.  One key difference is that the revised knowledge pyramid includes knowledge management as an extraction of reality with a focus on organizational learning.  The model also posits that newer initiatives such as business and/or customer intelligence are the result of confusion in understanding the traditional knowledge pyramid that is resolved in the revised knowledge pyramid.

1. Introduction   Much has been written on the knowledge pyramid or data, information, knowledge, wisdom, DIKW, hierarchy and its use in knowledge management, KM.

This paper continues this discussion but takes a different tack.  It is posited that the knowledge pyramid is an artifact of KM processes and not an artifact of reality.  This is a different tack in that several authors (Ackoff, Sharma, Bates, Fricke) consider the pyramid as a natural expression of the relationships between DIKW and the logical progression for the generation of IKW [1] [2] [17] [20].  This paper posits that the natural relationship between DIKW is actually an inverted pyramid and that the knowledge pyramid is an artificially constructed artifact representing the relationship between DIKW in an organizational KM context.

This is a conceptual paper that hopes to promote discussion and insight by researchers into the nature of KM and its relationship to the overall processes of learning.  It is expected that new insight into KM processes such as filtering and selection processes can be gained by this discussion.  Another goal of this paper is to create a model that integrates KM and Business Intelligence, BI, and/or the other ?intelligences? such as Customer Intelligence, CI.  It is  also expected that this discussion will generate a better understanding of KM processes so that better KM systems, KMS, can be designed.  Finally, this paper will state definitions of terms important to KM, including definitions of data, information, knowledge, and intelligence.  It is hoped that these can be accepted as working, consensus definitions but it is recognized that these terms are philosophical in nature and can be debated as long as we want.  This debate is embraced but not encouraged as I agree with Keen and Tan [15] who believe that while it is important to understand KM terms, it is unproductive for researchers to get focused on trying to precisely define these terms at the expense of furthering KM research.  As a discipline we need to allow the debate but we also need to unite into a consensus set of working definitions.  It is hoped this paper will spur this consensus.

2. Methodology   This is a conceptual paper, however, the arguments made and conclusions presented are based on action research.  The inspiration for this paper comes from a project the author is currently working with a United States based defense contractor.  Specifics of the project and the company cannot be presented due to nondisclosure agreements.  What can be said is that the company is attempting to take technologies and experience developed/gained working with United States Department of Defense and other national intelligence agencies and generate a commercial knowledge management offering.  The role of the author in this project is as a KM academic expert responsible for providing KM focus and direction.  It is action research as the author has a vested interest in the success of the project and in generating a commercial KM offering.

Specific data for this paper came from the company?s initial presentation of what was considered to be a knowledge pyramid.  This pyramid cannot be presented due to nondisclosure agreement.  However, the presented pyramid can be described as a fusion of the traditional knowledge pyramid with KM processes      and intelligence concepts.  It was analysis of this pyramid and discussions with the project team that is the basis for this paper.
