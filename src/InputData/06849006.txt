I. INTRODUCTION  It is evidently simple on the opinion of physicians to imagine 3D holographic structure at the continuous space; furthermore at least 50 years ago some pretty examples of photo holographic pictures were created successfully. This picture, for example could capture some set of amplitudes and phases of light beams on the planar projection under mirrored from pictured object coherent radiation of laser and the direct radiation of same laser (that has equal time-frequency, but not equal phase characteristics to interfere beams mutually [1]). To restore the initial object optically we need the reference radiation of laser beam to illuminate our holographic planar source written with appropriate holographic picture. In principle, it is possible to make a hologram for any wave [1, 2].

It is well known to physicians [3-6], unfortunately not so to the wide public, that holographic picture is undividable by content at least in the dimension D-1 in the sense of pictured object of dimension D. It means that given only the little part of the written holographic planar source we could restore the entire initial object picture, but with respective worsening of resolution. For example, at holographic reconstruction, each region of a photographic plate contains the whole image [3].

So, evidently, the principle described here could be used for any hologram, that was created for objects with wave nature.

On our opinion, a world meta-network, containing numerous heterogeneous subnets during its existence provides some periodic or not-so-periodic processes related to traffic distribution. Considering related sets of nodes, these processes could be represented as a set of wave functions, for first examining on the basis of their self-similarity. The traffic distributing act and routing services implementation into a set of network nodes are wave-pulsing processes with physical nature of medium different to light or acoustic beams on the one hand, but introducing broadband photonic nets this contradiction eliminates itself. On the other hand all these mutually related processes could be considered numerically as  a multi-dimensional holographic object. Then, given the mathematically described holographic ?picture? of these processes we could restore all the defined less dimensional metadata of network properties for some time period using some part of this meta-object holographic ?picture? only. It should be network connections structure in topology meaning, traffic volume amounts distribution, prediction of net behavior (due to higher dimension of holographic meta-data in the case of known space continuum properties for modified net) etc.



II. CREATING HOLOGRAPHIC MODEL OF THE NETWORK  A. The Research Subject  So, the subject of this work is to determine the methodological basics and to create an approach for common network properties description and restoring (extracting) mathematically being them digitized at respective network structures within principles of digital holography [7, 8].

Therefore we need to consider two important tasks. The first one is intended to create the holographic description of time-frequency network structure properties (Section 2.B), and the second task will consider the existing holographic metadata processing for evaluation, prediction and extracting of defined network properties for analyzed network infrastructure (Section 2.C) and for selected node-section (Section 2.D).

B. The Holographic Definition of Network Properties  It is clear that every network node should have numerous means to fix network-related proprietary data. It shouldn?t obviously be the information intended to be transmitted through the net. We should consider the properties of the traffic behaviors at each point of the network. Permanently, these properties are divided to the service network messaging, that upgrading the definitions of current network structure for routing purposes and some volume of information, which describes the time-frequency character of the inter-node traffic.

Appropriate calculation modules should be introduced at every external exchange network node, and, as it?s usually done for cloud network structures these ones are situated at the respective network nodes to complete the data analysis or service exchange procedures. Thus, we need to describe service traffic and data traffic at the each of N nodes with number z using some complex variables [8]. In order to describe mentioned parameters for these nodes we need to assume that  2014 IEEE International Black Sea Conference on Communications and Networking (BlackSeaCom)       they are forming multilayered hyper structure, and every node has own layer z within its parameterized connections to another ones. Such variables are transfer functions for every discrete layer of the network object. In other words, every node will have its own transfer plane with number z (see Fig. 1), and every discrete point of this plane will describe this layer?s (node?s) connections to another planes (nodes) in the terms of time-frequency traffic characteristics, namely using common spatial transverse Cartesian coordinates to characterize mutual  layers? interconnection ? ?zkk yx ;,  and co-location ? ?zyx ;,  within  the same network space continuum. Respectively, a complex  time-frequency variables of format ? ?zkk yx ;,?  should be  considered as complex traffic intensity zyx ,, ?  to respective  exchange point of layer (node) z with coordinates ? ?zkk yx ;,  on  the plane, from another exchange point of layer (node) situated in the same network space continuum with common spatial  transverse coordinates ? ?zyx ;, . It was mentioned, that format of these variables is complex, and let us assume that their real part is responsible for service traffic intensity description (due to its topologically-depending character), while the imaginary part is used to determine the internode data traffic amounts (due to their structural-traversing and pulsating properties). Using [8]:  ? ? ? ?  ? ?  ? ? ,~~~~exp  ;~,~~,~  exp;,      ydxdkykx f  z j  zk k  f yk  k  f xpyxp  kk k  z jzkk  yx  yx  yxyx  ? ? ?  ? ? ?  ??  ? ? ?  ? ? ? ?  ? ??  ? ? ? ?  ? ? ?  ???  ? ? ?  ??  (1)  where f is the metric distance coefficient of the network  system, f k  max    ?  ? ?  , max ?  - is the constant coefficient of the maximum available traffic intensity of the link in the entire  network, ? ?yxp ,1  and ? ?zyxp ;,2  are the pupil and object-pupil  functions of a view ? ? 1,1 ?yxp  and ? ? zyxzyxp ,,2 ;, ??  respectively, that should be applied synchronously and simultaneously into every nodes? calculation modules to get an entire holographic ?picture? of network proprietary metadata.

Fig. 1. The network nodes in the discrete network space continuum.

Links from Node 2 and Node z to Node 1 are shown.

Then, after respective calculations and data exchange, we need to calculate the common spatial network system impulse response (in the current network space continuum) corresponding to all z nodes using IFFT transform as following:  ? ? ? ?? ?zkkzyxh yx ;,;, 1 ??? ? .  (2) After these transformations, our multidimensional network  proprietary description should be converted and stored to the more compact complex holographic 2D form:  ? ? ? ?? ?  ? N  z  zyxhyxg  ;,, .  (3)  Therefore, this result is matching with [9] in the part of planar (while excluding z) interconnections numeric analysis for a network?s nodes set, providing us with the power of graph for the internode connectivity according to the graph theory.

C. Predicting the Network Proprietary Metadata Using its Holographic Representation  Thus, in the case of partially network failure, all the information will be restored immediately on demand using at least one digitized copy of holographic network meta- properties. Let us to restore the whole network proprietary metadata from its holographic representation using inverse imaging approach [10] for a properties prediction case within new network conditions/structure. Using equation (3) let us  convert 2D hologram ? ?yxg ,  of size NN ?  into vector of length  2N  g by lexicographic ordering. Similarly,  ? ? 2;, zyxh becomes z  ? . And for the prediction purposes the  modified network structure?s space continuum impulse  response in the form of 22 NN ? at least partially filled  modified matrix mod  zH  is formed from ? ?zyxh ;, mod  and gives us  zzH ? mod  after lexicographic ordering. Therefore, (3) could be rewritten as  ?? ?? modHg ,   (4)  where ?  is a length of 2N Gaussian random noises vector.

Respectively, ? ?Nz HHHHH modmod2mod1modmod ???  and  ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  ?  N?  ?  ?  ? ?   .

The analytical solution [11] could be represented as  ? ? .1? 1modmodmod gHHH TT ??? ??  Here, ?  is a Lagrangian, and 1 is the identity matrix. In other form, this solution could be represented as [8]:  .minarg? 22mod ggH ??? ???   (5)  Where ?  denotes the quadratic form of a vector, and the  term  g?  -represents the regularization to the ill-posed inverse problem.

2014 IEEE International Black Sea Conference on Communications and Networking (BlackSeaCom)     Solution (5) provides predicted complex values of flows intensity (or desirable network hyper structure restored ?picture? including necessary improvements of interconnections) at the entire modified network structure using previously formed basic network holographic proprietary metadata.

D. Sectional Network Proprietary Metadata Reconstruction  To reconstruct network proprietary metadata partially for desirable network node we need just use the appropriate number of section z and convolve the complex hologram with the matched filter at the section/node?s plane z. The matched  filter should be obtained after (2) as ? ? ? ?zyxhzyxh ?? ;,;, *  , after that our solution is following [8]:  ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?? ?  ? ? ? ?  ? ? ? ? ? ?.;,*;,*,,  ,,;,*  ;,*,,;,*,   *      *     *  zyxhzyxhzyxO  zyxOzyxh  zyxhzyxOzyxhyxg  i  N  i  i  N  i  ii  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ??  ?  (6)  We should use first resulting term ? ?zyxO ;,  as a most precious part of the solution and containing respective object of spatial proprietary network structure for selected node described and recovered as undividable part of the whole network using holographic principles. The second term is referred to the defocus holographic noise from the rest sections away from the targeted. This term will arise if we would use not so full complex hologram with some parts loosed or excluded due to different reasons. An entire solution should be obtained, its real and imaginary parts, for the first term and second one respectively. Thus, really, internode traffic should be an imaginary part of solution, as was assumed in the Section 2.B. If we wish to use traffic prediction while network is modifying, it should be realized using equation (6) similarly in the way presented at the Section 2.C within modified  network space continuum impulse response ? ?zyxh ;,mod .



III. CONCLUSION  1. The new approaches to analyzing and storing of big amounts of the network-related proprietary data were proposed.

Network properties are analyzing in their undividable entity after the structural topology holographic representation, which well matches their cloud character.

2. The ways for traffic analysis and prediction were proposed due to modified network system space continuum holographic properties calculation (at least partial for some holographic sections) and using them for network proprietary features reconstruction within new network conditions/structure.

3. As well as entire network proprietary metadata restoring/extracting we could provide its sectional node-by- node representation using entire holographic properties of the network.

4. A partial loosing or inaccessibility of the holographic properties of the network will affect to the mathematical precision (defocusing) of the necessary proprietary data extracting result, not the full calculation process.

5. In the case of partially network failure, all the proprietary information will be restored immediately on demand using at least one digitized copy of holographic network meta-properties.

6. Holographic network meta-properties could contain complex proprietary data to describe service structural traffic and traversal network data-traffic in the respective described network structure or its parts.

7. The approach was proposed is quite similar with tensor analysis [12], but the undividable holographic description of interconnected discrete network objects looks more natural and precise in the continuous world.
