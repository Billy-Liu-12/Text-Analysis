Change Profiles

Abstract  In this paper we introduce a generalization of associa- tion rules: change profiles. We analyze their properties, de- scribe their relationship to other structures in pattern dis- covery and sketch their possible applications. We study how the frequent patterns can be clustered based on their change profiles and propose methods for approximating the frequencies of the patterns from the approximate change profiles and bounding the intervals where the frequencies of the patterns are guaranteed to be. We evaluate empirically the methods for estimating the frequencies and the stability of their frequency estimates under different kinds of noise.

1 Introduction  Pattern discovery is a central task in data mining [19, 27].

Finding frequently occurring patterns from data has been one of the most actively studied problems in the field, and many kinds of frequent patterns can be found efficiently, see e.g. [1, 16, 26, 29, 38]. However, the fundamental problem in pattern discovery is how to benefit from the found pat- terns.

In this paper we study the global structure of the pattern collection from the local point of view of patterns. This is pursued by a new representation for pattern collections: change profiles. A change profile of a pattern describes what are the ratios between the frequency of the pattern and the frequencies of its sub- and superpatterns in the pat- tern collection, i.e., the patterns comparable with it w.r.t.

a given partial order relation. To simplify the considera- tions, we divide the change profile chp of a pattern p into two parts (adapting the terminology of [28, 33]): the spe- cializing change profile chps describes the changes to the superpatterns of p, and the generalizing change profile chpg describes the changes to the subpatterns of p.

As a concrete example, let us consider the set collection {A,B,C, AB, BC,AC,ABC}with frequencies fr (A) =  3/4, fr (B) = 1/2, fr (C) = 3/4, fr (AB) = 1/4, fr (AC) = 1/2, fr (BC) = 1/2 and fr (ABC) = 1/4.

For these frequencies, the specializing change profiles of the (singleton) sets A, B and C are mappings chAs = {B ?? fr (AB) / fr (A) = 1/3, C ?? fr (AC) / fr (A) = 2/3, BC ?? fr (ABC) / fr (A) = 1/3}, chBs = {A ?? fr (AB) / fr (B) = 1/2, C ?? fr (BC) / fr (B) = 1, AC ?? fr (ABC) / fr (B) = 1/2} and chCs = {A ?? fr (AC) / fr (C) = 2/3, B ?? fr (BC) / fr (C) = 2/3, AB ?? fr (ABC) / fr (C) = 1/3}.

The change profiles attempt to reach from the local de- scription of the data, a collection of patterns, to more global view of the relationships between the patterns. As an appli- cation to more classical pattern analysis, the change profiles can be used to define (dis)similarity measures between the patterns. Also, the patterns can be scored with help of their change profiles.

In addition of being a potentially useful tool in data anal- ysis, the change profiles can be used to construct condensed representations of pattern collections [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 25, 30, 32, 34, 35]. Many known condensed representations can be adapted to the change profiles but the change profiles sug- gest also some novel approaches to frequency estimation.

In this paper we introduce the concept of a change pro- file, a new representation for pattern collections that at- tempts to bridge the gap between local and global descrip- tion of data. We describe several variations of change pro- files and examine their properties. As the change profiles have more complex structure than the frequencies of the frequent patterns, they can be used to define dissimilarity measures between the frequent patterns. We consider dif- ferent approaches to cluster the change profiles and show that many of the clustering problems are NP -hard and inap- proximable for a wide variety of natural dissimilarity mea- sures for change profiles. As an application to the con- densed representations, we propose methods for approxi- mating frequencies of the frequent patterns from their ap- proximate change profiles and evaluate the methods empir- ically.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The con- cept of the change profile and its refinements are introduced in Section 2. The clustering of change profiles is studied in Section 3. In Section 4 a few approaches to estimate fre- quencies of a pattern collection from approximate change profiles are described. In Section 5 the frequency estima- tion methods are evaluated empirically. Section 6 consists of a short conclusion.

In the remaining sections we describe everything using frequent sets but the discussion generalizes readily to arbi- trary pattern collections with a partial order.

2 Association Rules and Change Profiles  The frequent set mining problem is, given a sequence d = d1 . . . dn of subsets of a finite set R and a threshold value ? ? [0, 1], find all subsets X of R such that the fre- quency of X ,  fr (X, d) = |{i : X ? di, 1 ? i ? n}|  n ,  is at least ?. These sets are called ?-frequent sets in d and they are denoted by F (?, d). The frequency of X can be interpreted as the empirical probability P (X) of the event ?the event contains X as its subset?.

A classical set R is the collection of items sold in a su- permarket. Then the most popular sequence d of subsets of R is sequence of market baskets of the customers. In addi- tion to the market baskets of the customers, there are several other interesting sequences of subsets of the items: for the logistics division of a company, an interesting sequence d could rather be the sequence of packages arriving from the logistics center.

The frequent set mining is computationally feasible as there are several methods for mining frequent sets (output) efficiently [1, 3, 17, 18, 21, 22, 37]. Although each frequent set contains useful information about the data set, also the relationships between different frequent sets might be valu- able. These relationships has been exploited by association rules.

An association rule X ? Y is a rule that associates a set X ? R to a set Y ? R. An association rule X ? Y is called simple if Y is a singleton. The accuracy of the association rule X ? Y is  acc (X ? Y, d) = fr (X ? Y, d) fr (X, d)  .

The frequency of the rule X ? Y is defined to be fr (X ? Y, d) = fr (X ? Y, d). The accuracy of the as- sociation rule X ? Y can be interpreted as a conditional probability P (Y |X). Thus each association rule X ? Y describes one relationship of the set X . (Empirical condi- tional probabilities with different kinds of events has been studied in data mining under the name of cubegrades [23].)  A more global view to relationships between the frequent set X and other frequent sets can be obtained by combin- ing the association rules X ? Y into a mapping from the frequent sets to the interval [0, 1]. We call this mapping a specializing change profile:  Definition 1 (Specializing change profile) A specializing change profile of a frequent set X is a mapping  chXs : {Y : X ? Y ? F (?, d)} ? [0, 1] consisting of the accuracies of frequent rules X ? Y , i.e.,  chXs (Y ) = fr (X ? Y, d)  fr (X, d)  where X ? Y ? F (?, d).

A specializing change profile chXs can be interpreted as a conditional probability distribution P (Y|X) where Y is a random variable.

Similarly to the specializing change profiles, we can de- fine a generalizing change profile:  Definition 2 (Generalizing change profile) A specializ- ing change profile of a frequent set X is a mapping  chXg : F (?, d)? [1, 1/?) consisting of the inverse accuracies of the frequent rules acc (X \ Y ? X), i.e.,  chXg (Y ) = fr (X \ Y, d)  fr (X, d) .

We denote change profiles by chX when we do not want to fix the type of the change profile. chX (Y ) is called a change of X on Y . The generalizing change profile of X corresponds to 1/ P (X|X \Y).

Each specializing and generalizing change profile chXs and chXg describe ?upper? and ?lower? neighborhoods Ns(X) and Ng(X) of the frequent set X in the collection of frequent sets, respectively. The neighborhood N(X) = Ns(X) ? Ng(X) of X consists of the frequent sets Y ? Ns(X) that contain X and the frequent sets Y ? Ng(X) that are contained in X , i.e., the frequent sets that are com- parable with X .

The change profiles, as we have defined them, are highly redundant due to the following simple properties of sets:  ? X ? Y = X ? (Y \X) and ? X \ Y = X \ (Y ?X).

By exploiting these properties, we can reduce (without loss of information) the number of defined values of the change profile by factor 2|X| in the case of a specializing change profile chXs , and by factor 2  |R\X| in the case of a generaliz- ing change profile chXg . We call this kind of change profiles with reduced redundancy the concise change profiles:     Definition 3 (Concise specializing change profile) A concise specializing change profile cchXs is a restric- tion of chXs to elements Y such that Y ? X = ? and X ? Y ? F (?, d).

Definition 4 (Concise generalizing change profile) A concise generalizing change profile cchXg is a restriction of chXg to elements Y such that Y ? X .

The concise change profiles can be interpreted as affine axis-parallel subspaces of R|F(?,d)| that are indexed by Y s.t. Y ? X = ?, X ? Y ? F (?, d) in the specializing case, and Y s.t. Y ? X in the generalizing case. The con- cise change profiles for F (?, d) can be computed output- optimally by a careful implementation of the following al- gorithm: CHANGE-PROFILES(F (?, d) , fr) 1 for each X in F (?, d) 2 do for each Y, Y ? X 3 do cchX\Ys (Y )? fr (X) / fr (X \ Y ) 4 cchXg (Y )? fr (X \ Y ) / fr (X) 5 return  ( cchs, cchg  )  The neighborhoods of even the concise change profiles can be too large: For example, if X ? F (?, d), then | cch?s | ? 2|X| and | cchXg | ? 2|X|. Thus, following the definitions of association rules, we define simple specializ- ing change profiles and simple generalizing change profiles:  Definition 5 (Simple change profile) A simple specializ- ing (generalizing) change profile schXs (sch  X g ) is a restric-  tion of chXs (of ch X s ) to singletons Y .

The number of bits needed for a simple change profile is at most |R| log |d|: Each change profile can be expressed as a vector of length |R| and each value of the change profile can be describe using at most log |d| bits. Especially for the generalizing change profiles, this upper bound can be quite loose when R is large as the number of sets in F (?, d) is ?  ( 2|X|  ) where X is the largest set in F (?, d).

3 Clustering the Change Profiles  In order to be able to find groups of similar change pro- files, it would be useful to be able to somehow measure the (similarity or) dissimilarity between the change pro- files. The dissimilarity between change profiles chX and chY can be defined to be their distance in the common do- main Dom  ( chX  )?Dom (chY ) w.r.t. some distance func- tion. (We assume the dissimilarity function ? to be such that ?  ( chX , chY  ) = 0 ?? chX (Z) = chY (Z) holds  for all Z ? Dom (chX)?Dom (chY ).) A complementary approach would be to focus on the differences in the struc- ture of the pattern collection, e.g., to measure the difference  between two change profiles by computing the symmetric difference of their domains. This kind of dissimilarity func- tion concentrates wholly on the structure of the pattern col- lection and thus neglects the frequencies. A sophisticated dissimilarity function should probably consist both points of view. We shall focus on the first one. We further assume that for the distance function ? holds:  There are several ways to define what is a good clustering (and each approach has its own strengths and weaknesses [13, 24]). A simple way to group change profiles based on a dissimilarity function defined in their (pairwise) common domains, is to allow two change profiles chX and chY to be in the same group only if ?  ( chX , chY  ) = 0. The task  is, given a collection Ch of change profiles, to find a par- tition Ch1, . . . , Chk of Ch such that for each chX , chY ? Chi, 1 ? i ? k, holds: ?  ( chX , chY  ) = 0. Let us call this  problem the change profile packing problem. Unfortunately, the problem seems to be very difficult:  Theorem 1 The change profile packing problem for spe- cializing change profiles is at least as hard as the minimum graph coloring problem  Proof. The minimum graph coloring problem is, given a graph G = (V,E), to find a labeling l : V ? N of vertices with the smallest number of different labels l (u) such that if u, v ? V are adjacent then l(u) = l(v) [2].

Let v1, . . . , vn be an (arbitrary) ordering of the vertices in V and e1, . . . , em an ordering of the edges in E. We first construct an instance (?, d) of frequent set mining prob- lem and then show that the specializing change profiles Ch computed from the frequent sets F (?, d) can be partitioned into k sets Ch1, . . . , Chk if and only if the graph G is k- colorable. To simplify the description we shall consider, w.l.o.g., simple change profiles instead of change profiles.

The set R consists of the elements in V ? E. For each vi there are 3n sets di,1, . . . , di,3n. Each set di,j contains vi. We put the edge {vi, vj} ? E into di,3(j?1)+1 and di,3(j?1)+2 if i < j, and otherwise into di,3j . We set ? = 1/  ( 3n2  ) and compute the collection F (?, d) of fre-  quent sets.

The collection F (?, d) consists of the empty set  ?, singletons {v1}, . . . , {vn}, {e1, }, . . . , {em} and pairs {vi, e} ? V ? E where vi ? e. Thus the cardinality of F (?, d) is polynomial in the size of G.

The simple change profiles of F (?, d) are the following:  sch?s (x) = {  1/n 1/n2  if x ? V if x ? E  sches (v) = 1 if v ? e schvis ({vi, vj}) =  { 2/ (3n) 1/ (3n)  if i < j if i > j  Clearly, ? ( sch?, schv  ) > 0, ?  ( sch?, sche  ) > 0 and  ? (schv, sche) > 0. Thus no two of schv , sche and sch?     for any v ? V and e ? E can be in same group. On the other hand, all the sches can be packed into one set Chk+1 and sch?s will always have its own set Chk+2.

Now we only have show that the simple specializing change profiles schvs (e), can be partitioned into k sets Ch1, . . . , Chk if and only if the graph G is k-colorable: No two simple specializing change profiles schvis and sch  vj s can be in the same group if {vi, vj} ? E since  schvis ({vi, vj}) = schvjs ({vi, vj}). If {vi, vj} /? E then Dom (schvis ) ?Dom  ( sch  vj s  ) = ? they can be in the same  group.

As the minimum graph coloring problem can be mapped  to the change profile packing problem for specializing change profiles, the latter is at least as hard as the minimum graph coloring problem. ?  The minimum graph coloring problem is hard to approx- imate within |V |1?? for any ? > 0 unless NP = ZPP [15].

Assuming that the graph is connected we get from the above mapping from graphs to change profiles the following rough  upper bound: |Ch| = 1+|V |+2 |E| ? 1+|V |+2 ???( |V |2  )??? = O  ( |V |2  ) . Therefore, the change profile packing problem is  hard to approximate within ? ( |Ch|(1/2)??  ) for any ? > 0.

Although the inapproximability results seem to be dev- astating, there are efficient heuristics, such as the first-fit and the best-fit heuristics [10], that might be able find suffi- ciently good partitions efficiently. However, the usefulness of the heuristics should be evaluated carefully for different data sets and pattern collections.

The requirement that two change profiles chX and chY  can be in the same group Chi only if ? ( chX , chY  ) = 0,  might be too strict. A simple approach to relax this is to discretize the frequencies of frequent sets or the changes in the change profiles. Discretizations minimizing several dif- ferent loss functions can be found efficiently, see e.g. [31].

Instead of minimizing the number of clusters, one could minimize the error for fixed number of clusters. This kind of clustering is called k-clustering, it is well-studied and good approximation algorithms are known if the dissimilar- ity function is a metric [11, 12, 14].

Unfortunately, it turns out that distance function defined to be the dissimilarity between change profiles in their com- mon domain cannot be a metric as it cannot satisfy even the triangle inequality:  Theorem 2 Let d be a function that measures the distance between the change profiles chX and chY in their common domain domain Dom  ( chX  ) ? Dom (chY ). Then d does not satisfy the triangle inequality.

Proof. Let chX , chY and chZ be three change profiles such that Dom  ( chX  ) ? Dom (chY ) = Dom (chY ) ? Dom  ( chZ  ) = ? and ?  ( chX , chY  ) > 0. (Thus  Dom ( chX  ) ? Dom (chZ) = ?.) Clearly, these change profiles do not satisfy the triangle inequality since ? ( chX , chZ  ) > 0 = ?  ( chX , chY  ) + ?  ( chY , chZ  ) . ?  It turns out that the k-clustering of specializing change profile is even worse than the change profile packing prob- lem as by combining Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 we get:  Theorem 3 k-clustering of specializing change profiles cannot be approximated within any ratio.

Proof. If we could approximate k-clustering of specializing change profiles, then we could, by Theorems 1 and 2, solve the minimum graph coloring problem exactly. ?  A major goal in the clustering of the change profiles is to further understand the relationships between the frequent sets. As the nature of data mining is exploratory, defining a maximum number for clusters or a maximum dissimilarity threshold might be difficult and unnecessary. These param- eters can be avoided by searching for hierarchical clustering instead [20]. A hierarchical clustering of Ch is a recursive partition of the elements to 2, 3, . . . , |Ch| clusters. It has the enormous benefit from the exploratory data analysis point of view that all the clusterings can be visualized in the same time by a tree.

There are two main categories of hierarchical clustering: agglomerative and divisive. The first begins with |Ch| clus- ters and recursively merges them and the latter recursively partites the set Ch. Both are optimal in a certain sense: each agglomerative (divisive) hierarchical clustering of Ch into k groups is optimal w.r.t. the clustering into k+1 groups (into k?1 groups) determined the same agglomerative (divisive) hierarchical clustering.

Divisive strategy seems to be more suitable for clustering the change profiles as the dissimilarity functions we con- sider are defined to be distances between change profiles in their (pairwise) common domains: The agglomerative clustering groups first change profiles with disjoint domains more or less arbitrary. The choices of groups made in the first few merges can cause huge differences in the cluster- ings into smaller number of clusters, although the groups of change profiles with disjoint domains are probably quite unimportant for the whole hierarchical clustering. On the other hand, the divisive clustering concentrates first on the nonzero distances and thus the change profiles with disjoint domains do not bias the whole hierarchical clustering.

4 Frequency Estimation from Change Pro- files  The change profiles can be used as a basis of condensed representations and several known condensed representa- tions can be adapted to the change profiles. One interest- ing approach to condense the change profiles is to choose     a small set of representative change profiles (by using e.g.

divisive clustering), replace the original change profiles by the chosen representatives, and then estimate the frequen- cies from the approximate change profiles. This can be seen as a condensed representation of the frequent sets as the ap- proximate change profiles can fit (potentially) into smaller space than the exact change profiles or even the frequent sets. Also, the condensed representations can be applied to further condense the approximate change profiles. In addi- tion to that frequencies can be estimated from the approx- imate change profiles, the change profiles can benefit from the estimation: the quality of the approximate change pro- files can be assessed by evaluating how well the frequencies can be approximated from them.

For the rest of the section we consider only the case where no change profile is missing but they are corrupted.

However, the methods can be generalized to handle missing change profiles and missing change profile values.

Thus, given approximations of change profiles for a fre- quent set collection F (?, d), it is possible to estimate (ap- proximations of) the frequencies of the sets inF (?, d) from the approximative change profiles. This estimation can be done in many ways and which approach is the best depends on how the change profiles are approximated. Here we de- scribe an approach that is based on the estimates given by different paths from the empty set ? to the set X of which frequency is being estimated. Especially, we concentrate on computing the average of the frequencies given by the paths from ? to X . (We describe the methods using sim- ple specializing change profiles but the adaptation to simple generalizing change profiles is straightforward.)  The number of paths equals to the number of permuta- tions of elements in X which is |X|!. If F (?, d) consists of X and all of its subsets, then |X| = log |F (?, d)| and the number of paths is superpolynomial in |F (?, d)|. (This example is the worst case.) However, the average frequency estimate over all paths can be computed much faster by ob- serving that the average frequency of X is the average of the average frequencies of Y ? X, |Y | = |X| ? 1, scaled by chYs (X \ Y )?s, i.e.,  fr (X) = |X|  ? Y ?X,|Y |=|X|?1  fr (Y ) schYs (X \ Y ) .

From this observation we can derive a dynamic program- ming solution for the problem: DP-FROM-SCHS(X, schs) 1 fr (?)? 1 2 for i = 1 to |X| 3 do for each Y ? X, |Y | = i 4 do fr (Y )? 0 5 for each Z ? Y, |Z| = |Y | ? 1 6 do fr (Y )? fr (Y ) + fr (Z) schZs (Y \ Z) 7 fr (Y )? fr (Y ) /|Y |  8 return fr (X)  The time complexity of the algorithm is O (|X|2|X|) =  O (|F (?, d)| log |F (?, d)|) where k is the number of paths sampled. Even this can be too much. We can further speed up the estimation by simply sampling uniformly from the paths from ? to X: SAMPLER-FROM-SCHS(X, schs, k)  1 fr (?)? 1 2 fr (X)? 0 3 for j = 1 to k 4 do Y ? ? 5 for i = 1 to |X| ? 1 6 do A? RANDOM-ELEMENT (X \ Y ) 7 fr (Y ? {A})? fr (Y ) schYs ({A}) 8 Y ? Y ? {A} 9 fr (X)? fr (X) + fr (Y ) schYs (X \ Y )  10 fr (X)? fr (X) /k 11 return fr (X)  The time complexity of the algorithm is O (k|X|). The algorithm can be easily modified to an any-time algorithm.

This is very useful for interactive data mining (and for re- source bounded computation in general).

We can apply the same algorithms to other kinds of esti- mates, too. Especially, if we have upper and lower bounds for schYs (Z) for all Y ? X, Z ? X \ Y , then we can com- pute upper and lower bounds for fr (X): the frequency of fr (X) is at most (at least) the maximum of the minimum estimates (the minimum of the maximum estimates) given by the paths from ? to X .

5 Empirical Evaluation of the Frequency Es- timation  In this section we experimentally evaluate the stability of the (noisified) simple (specializing) change profiles in fre- quency approximation. More specifically, we want to find out how the frequency estimation from change profiles tol- erates different kinds of noise and how the number of sam- pled paths affects the quality of approximation compared to the dynamic programming solution of the problem.

Our primary data were two data sets from UCI KDD Repository:1 Internet Usage data set consisting of 10104 rows and 10674 attributes, and IPUMS Census data set con- sisting of 88443 rows and 39954 attributes.

The noisified simple change profiles were constructed as follows: We computed the frequent sets with different min- imum frequency thresholds from the above mentioned data sets using Christian Borgelt?s implementation of the Apri- ori algorithm [4]. From the frequent sets, we computed the  1http://kdd.ics.uci.edu     simple change profiles.

In order to study how estimation methods tolerate dif-  ferent kinds of noise, the change profiles were noisified in three different ways:  ? randomly perturbing the values of the change profiles by ??, ? adding uniform noise from the interval [??, ?] to the  values of the change profiles, and  ? adding zero-mean Gaussian noise with standard devi- ation ? to the values of the change profiles.

We truncated the noisified changes to the interval [0, 1] as, by the definition of specializing change profile, the changes in a generalizing change profile must be in that interval.

We tested the dependency of the approximation on the number of sampled paths by evaluating the absolute differ- ence between the correct and the estimated frequencies for the dynamic programming solution corresponding to the av- erage over all paths, and the sampling solution correspond- ing to the average over different number of paths. We ex- perimented with different number of paths, minimum fre- quency thresholds ? and noise levels ?. Also multiplicative variants of the noising schemes were tested. The results were similar to the representative results shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. Clearly, quite small number of paths suffices to give approximations close to the dynamic programming solution.

6 Conclusions  In this paper we have introduced the concept of change profiles, a new representation for a pattern collection that attempts to reach for a more global view to data without losing the benefits of the local view. We have studied their basic properties and applications. Approaches to cluster change profiles has been suggested and several change pro- file clustering problems has been shown to be computation- ally hard for wide variety of natural dissimilarity measures.

Also, we have shown how the collection of frequent sets can be approximated from a collection of their approximate change profiles.

There are several interesting open problems for further research:  ? The connection between change profiles and local search should be explored systematically. For exam- ple, the change profiles could be interpreted through the research on combinatorial landscapes [36].

Also, distance functions suitable for comparing change profiles should be examined rigorously.

? The condensed representations based on change pro- files should be studied further. For example, exploring the possible rule systems (see e.g. [8]) to find ones that are well-suited for condensing collections of change profiles could be useful. The frequency estimation from change profiles seems to generalize nicely to out- side the frequent sets. Thus the possibilities to use change profiles to estimate the joint probability distri- bution from the change profiles of frequent sets should be investigated.
