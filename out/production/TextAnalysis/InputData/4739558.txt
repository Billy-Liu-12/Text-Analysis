On Frequent Item Sets Acquisition Based on the Set Operations of Item- Transaction List

Abstract   Mining the frequent item sets is the core of algorithm for mining association rules. Therefore, to improve the efficiency of discovering the frequent item sets is a key issue in data mining area. In this paper, an algorithm for acquiring the frequent item sets, which is based on the set operations of item-transaction list, is put forward. It turns out to cost less in terms of both space and time.

Moreover, it is applied to get the scheme modifying association rules in the intelligent system for technical examination of vehicles in accident, and it proves effective.

1. Introduction   As the most important and popular one of data- mining methods, association rule method was firstly put forward by Agrawal R in 1993[1]. R.Agrawal used the Apriori algorithm to mine the association rules. Apriori algorithm involves two steps: first, it finds the frequent item sets with the support degree being more than the threshold; second, it generates the association rules based on the frequent item sets. Apriori algorithm is Anti- monotone, i.e. if an item sets is not a frequent item sets, then its supper sets are all not frequent item sets, thus the ( k +1) candidates can be generated based on the k frequent item sets, which narrows down the search range of algorithm.

The Apriori algorithm has the following limitations: (1)The time of scanning the database is equal to the  length of max frequent item sets. So, if there are some long frequent item sets, it would take a long time.

(2)More candidates may be generated. If the number of frequent item sets with the length being 1 is more than 10000, the number of frequent item sets with the length being 2 will be more than 10MB;  (3)The infrequent but important information can not be taken into account. Due to the minimization support degree, the transactions with low support degree can not be involved. Similarly, if the minimization support degree is set to be very low, the efficiency of the algorithm would be poor, and many irrelevant item sets may be generated.

Many candidates and timely scanning database are the bottlenecks of Apriori algorithm, focus on these limitations, many researchers do much work to improve the algorithm, and many extended algorithms were advanced, such as AprioriTid algorithm presented in reference [2], Pruning algorithm presented in reference [3], Hash table technique presented in reference [4], Partition based association rules mining algorithm presented in reference [5], sampling algorithm presented in reference [6], and the DIC(Dynamic Item set Counting) presented in reference [7].

Different from the extended algorithms, there are other algorithms based on different theories and data expression for discovering association rule. The Tree Projection algorithm[8] takes the Lexicographic tree as the frame of data store. With the strategy of depth first, the database transactions can be projected and counted in the tree, with a matrix, the frequency of item sets is calculated lastly. Therefore, it is speedier than the Apriori algorithm.

The FP-growth algorithm, put forward by Han in reference [9], is a type of frequent pattern mining method based on frequent pattern tree(FP-tree). Compared with the Apriori algorithm, it has these following properties: (1)Using the FP-tree to store the key information of database, it scans the database for only two times, so more I/O time for scanning database can be saved. (2)The candidate needs not to be generated, so more time for generating and testing candidate can be saved.(3)With the strategy of dividing and ruling, the search range can be narrowed down[10-12]. The algorithm based on Diffset[13], brought forth by Zaki, only keeps the difference between the candidate pattern and the existing frequent pattern, so it reduces much storage place, especially for the denseness data.

Different from the above algorithms, a method based on the set Operations of item-transaction list is put forward to get the frequent item sets. In the intelligent system for technical examination of vehicles in accident, this method is applied to the scheme modifying transaction, thus the frequent items set for association rules is gained.

2. Frequent item sets acquisition based on the set Operations of item-transaction list  Second International Symposium on Intelligent Information Technology Application  DOI 10.1109/IITA.2008.148   Second International Symposium on Intelligent Information Technology Application  DOI 10.1109/IITA.2008.148   Second International Symposium on Intelligent Information Technology Application  DOI 10.1109/IITA.2008.148      Suppose }),...,2,1{( mji j ?  is an item of item set  },...,,{ 21 miiiI = , ),...,,( 21 jnjjj TTTLT =  is the list of the transactions which concern }),...,2,1{( mji j ? , then Item-transaction list is  }},1{|),{( mjLTiL jj ?= .

As an example, table 2 gives a transactions list, and  table 3 shows the corresponded item-transaction list.

The algorithm put forward in the paper is based on  the set Operations between item-transaction lists, which is described as follows:  (1)To choose the items whose corresponding transactions number is equal to or bigger than the minimization support number as the frequent 1-items set;  (2)For each items set of frequent k -items set and each items set of frequent 1-items set, if their intersection set?s number is k +1 and the corresponding transactions? number is equal to or bigger than the minimization support number, then the set is a k +1-items set, so we can get all the frequent items set.

Detailed algorithm is showed as follows.

Algorithm name: Frequent item sets acquisition based on the set Operations of item-transaction list Input: Item-transaction list, the minimization support number Output: The set P of ),,( ii LTLIk , and k  is the number of frequent items, iLI  is the items list corresponding to the frequent items, iLT  is the transactions list corresponding to the frequent items.

qLT = the transactions list corresponding to the q th frequent item sets of Psub _1_ .

IF pLI ? qLI ? ?  and  qp LTLT ? Dsup*min_>  Then  )},,1{( qpqp LTLTLILIkPP ??? += ; }  } 1+= kk ;  } End  3. The analysis of algorithm   1) The analysis of space complexity In the terms of space, it is to store the item-  transaction recorders. Due to the certain number of items, the storage space is certain too, so it is more efficient than the Apriori algorithm with the property of storing much candidate.

2) The analysis of time complexity In the terms of time, it involves the following three  parts: (1)The time for scanning the transactions list to  generate the item-transaction list, which is determined by the length of transactions list and is estimated by )(nO .

Here n  is the number of transactions;  (2)The time for scanning the item-transaction list to generate the 1-frequent items set, which is estimated by  )(mO . Here m  is the number of the items; (3)The time for scanning the item-transaction list and  k -frequent items set to generate k +1-frequent items set, which is estimated not more than )**)1(( lmkO ? .

Here l  is the item sets? number of k -frequent items set.

Due to m , n  and l  are certain and small, the total time expense is less than that of the Aprior algorithm.

4. An example   Scientific traffic management entails the identification & compensation for road traffic accident, in which the technical examination of vehicles in accident plays a pivotal role. Through the technical examination, we can get a general picture of how the vehicle acts in the traffic accident, thus objectively analyzing the reasons behind the accident so as to identify the party?s liability.

Nowadays vehicles are numerous, and the number of road traffic accidents is on the rise, which calls for more experts as well as more scientific examinations indeed.

For technical examination to be more efficient, an intelligent system for technical examination of vehicles in accident is developed, in which the CBR method is applied to chose the scheme of the most similar one as the scheme of the new problem from the history case, then, the scheme modifying association rules is applied to help decision maker modify the scheme of the new problem, and more importantly, the algorithms based on the set operations of item-transaction list is applied to get the scheme modifying association rules.

The scheme?s structure in the system is showed in table 1, from which we can see that a scheme is composed of some examination items, and to modify the scheme means to delete or add some examination items from it.

Table 1 The scheme?s structure  Field name  Field type Field length  Remark  jddbh Char 18 Scheme number jdxmbh Char 10 Item number jdxmmc Char 24 Item number  jdbz Char 100 Standard jdjg Char 20 Result  Let },...,,{ 21 miiiI =  be the set of all examination  items, and }),...,2,1{( mji j ?  be an item of },...,,{ 21 miiiI = . Let  ),(),...,(),({ 21 miAddiAddiAddT = )}(),...,(),( 21 miDeliDeliDel  be the set of all modification actions, here )( liAdd means adding examination item li  and )( jiDel  means deleting examination item ji . Let  },...,,{ 1211 niiiP = be the former scheme and },...,,{  2212 n iiiP =  be the  final scheme. Supposing 1I  be the set of items deleted, and we can get 211 PPI ?= ; supposing 2I  be the set of items added, and we can get 122 PPI ?= , so a modifying transaction can be  })({})({ 21 IiiaddIiidelT jjll ??= ? .

In this way, the system collects all the modifying  transactions that decision maker made, and the part of transactions set is showed in table 2. We transform table 2 into item-transaction set, which is showed in table 3. By setting the support degree as 0.2, we apply the algorithms based on the set operations of item-transaction list and gain the final frequent item sets, which are showed in table 4.

Conclusion   Frequent item sets acquisition based on the set operations of item-transaction list transforms the transactions list into item-transaction list. By doing some set operations on this list, the final frequent item sets is gotten. The analysis of algorithm shows that it is simple, and costs little in space & time. Also , the actual application proves it is easy and worthy to be programmed. Moreover, the final results gotten by the algorithm not only include the frequent number and frequent items but also the transactions list corresponding to the frequent item sets, which can be applied to study whether the association rules are ordinary rules or individual rules, and it would be our future task.
