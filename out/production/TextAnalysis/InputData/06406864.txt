Application of Association Analysis in Digital Content Industry

Abstract?To fully tap the potential of digital content industry, we should upgrade digital content industrial chain to a value profit chain which could generate continuous revenue with the support of information technology. In this paper, we develop an application model based on an advanced data processing technique: association analysis in the field of digital content industry. This model is user-centric, that is, to extract valuable information from massive data storage accumulated over the years in digital content industry from two aspects: products and services, thus to turn passive services to active ones, which could ultimately dig out the endless economic potential of digital content industry.

I.  INTRODUCTION Compared with traditional publishing, the biggest  difference, also the significant specialty of digital content industry is the integration of digital techniques, which brings many advantages such as simplified process of creation, products at a more affordable price, reading beyond time and space, query and search processing with more efficiency, etc.

To digital content industry, it is no doubt that produces and services that remain the core essence [4], and it is also indisputable that technology is a useful tool to improve the quality of products and services. With the help of information technology, we could upgrade content resources to information services, thus to turn digital content industrial value chain to a product&service profit chain, which is an exact traction to accelerate the development of digital content industry.



II. CONTENT INDUSTRY AND DATA PROCESSING TECHNOLOGIES  Digital content industry is a new publishing model combined of information technology and content publishing, through which ?technology? has gone the whole development process. The technology not only has transformed the production model of publishing resources, updated the business process of publishing corporations, but also reconstructed the industrial chain, and greatly enriched the profit patterns of publishing industry [3]. In the field of digital content industry, technology is everywhere: from the basic content processing, the act of paying, to content acquisition and the final content reading. Each step is  inseparable from technical support. The industrial property and core business is always ?content? though, and the future of digital content industry is bound to a value-added process around the center of content. Therefore, to maximize the value of content resources, it is of great necessity to have some data processing tools to process the industrial data.

From the perspective on development, China?s digital content industry and data processing technology have gone through 3 stages.

The first stage is the digitalization of content resources.

With the appearances of modern technologies like network technology, multimedia technology and database technology, come the subversive changes on content creation, processing, storage and dissemination. The sources for resources of digital content industry are no longer just pens and papers, but the digital forms of traditional printing resources, or direct keyboard-typing of writers. In the meantime, the content resource platforms began to be established, as well as the reformations of operating mode, industrial chain, profit mode, etc. The prototype of digital content industry started to take shape.

The second stage is the in-depth processing, classification and management of content resources. When the digital resources have accumulated to a remarkable amount, more advanced data processing technologies have begun to be used in the management of content resources, including the establishment of specialized databases, the indexing to resource information, the classification of knowledge modules, the building of supporting material libraries and so on. The more meticulous and detailed the work is, the higher utilization of digital content is. The digital content industry began to realize the content management at a high level with more scientific rigor.

The third stage is the value maximization of content resources. When the digitalization work is basically accomplished, and the management of resource has become more and more scientific, the industrialized and commercialized development begins to show its status. From the perspective of industrial chain (?content resource resource integration platform terminal equipment user?), the upper reaches of content resource does matter, it is still for the users though. Only if we put the content production and innovation on the foundation of customers, users, readers and consumers, make full use of advantages of network and technology, and take the advance data processing tools to meet personalized and diversified needs, could we realize the  2012 Fifth International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Design  DOI 10.1109/ISCID.2012.13     maximum value of content resources, that is to say, the key to developing the source of power of digital content industry exists right in customer market.

The above analysis shows that data processing technologies have gone through a process from simple and basic to complex and advanced during different development stages of digital content industry. In the forthcoming future, we should concentrate more on user-centric products and services besides basic data processing. Therefore, advanced information technology is vital [5]. By high-level analysis and high-intelligent data mining of massive dataset repositories, we could extract decision supports to promote the industry, make data a ?vivid? role as a knowledge speaker, not just underlying source, thus to help digital publisher on products and services provision (see Fig. 1).

III. OVERVIEW OF DATA MINING AND ASSOCIATION ANALYSIS  Data Mining (DM) is an advance data processing technology which is very popular in recent years and has drew a lot of attention. It?s a comprehensive subject, including artificial intelligence (AI), database technology, statistics, knowledge-based system, information retrieval, etc [1]. Not like general statistics, DM is a high-intelligent analysis technique with the ability to extract valuable rule or patterns from large amounts of data, which can effectively shorten the gap between ?data? and ?information?.

Nowadays, data mining has penetrated a variety of industries, for example, ?market basket analysis? in retail industry, ?DNA sequencing? in biomedical science, ?outlier detection? in banking and financial sectors. Among all he data mining functions, it is association analysis that has the widest applications and most in-depth studies.

The association analysis was first proposed in 1993 by R.Agrawa, etc. With the aim of finding interesting association or relationships between a large set of data items.

Its basic principle could be described as: given a transaction set D, an association rule is of the form X=>Y, where X, Y are disjoint subsets of attribute sets. Then people could mine out various correlations by setting two important measures: support (s) and confidence (c) from transaction databases, relational databases or data warehouses [1].

Association analysis has been widely applied in actual industries, and typical examples include: ?market basket analysis? in retail: to refine shelf design, product placement, etc. through the relationships among purchased goods; ?customer relationship management (CRM)? in e-commerce: to make better management decisions and gain greater business profits by analyzing customers? personal information and behavior data [8]; ?bundled services? in telecommunications: to bind products and services together like a packaged promotion by finding out the connection between them.

Therefore, the biggest help brought by association analysis is: this technology could an intelligent mining based on industrial data, extract refined, hidden and potentially valuable knowledge to help make better business decisions, as well as analyze customer information to provide more personalized and perfect services.



IV. APPLICATIONS OF ASSOCIATION ANALYSIS IN DIGITAL CONTENT INDUSTRY  From the above analysis of Chinese digital content industry and data processing technology, we propose the following application mode, see Fig. 2.

Figure 2.  Application model of association analysis in digital contetn industy  To sum it up, the industrialization of digital content industry can be promote by the knowledge discovery technique of association analysis, with customers at the heart and two key aspects: publishing resource optimization and service innovation.

A. Resource Optimization Publishing industry is a content industry which cannot  live without content, in other words, content is of unique status. Consequently, the platform-building work of digital resources has always been the focus. And excellent platform should not only have the ability to seize audience?s eyes, but meet customers? needs at different levels on the quality and quantity of content resources.

In order to achieve this object, digital publishers could collect the data in website records, and adjust the page layout, color, style, page level, etc. by association analysis, thus to  Data resources  Technologies  Products Services  Users  Publishing resources  Transaction records  Customers? personal information (network behaviors and basic  attributes)  Extraction of association rules  Services Resources  Personalized service  Service exploration Heart: customers  Platform design  Resource optimization Marketing  optimization     meet individual habits and needs in accordance with different classes of users  [2].

In addition, when compared with international digital publishing, there exists another obvious weakness on content resources, high-quality subject books in particular. With the support of association analysis, it would be much easier to classify the structural relationship between various disciplines of knowledge, work out a scientific bibliography plan, and construct classification rule and systems of highly relevant knowledge base, thus to provide customers with more clear and accurate knowledge resources.

B. Service Innovation 1) Combind Marketing: The marketing modes of  traditional publishing industry are limited and of low efficiency, while in the digital era, each transaction could be recorded into backstage database. Consequently, it becomes very convenient for us to check the product sales, and provide more proactive, more efficient and more targeted services.

?Cross Marketing? is one of them. Like ?market basket analysis? in retail area, cross marketing provides bundle package purchase (to bundle several goods which are often purchased simultaneously in one package) by digging the hidden relationships out. Another way is to list bibliography with high relevance, e.g. Chinese-English/English-Chinese Practical Dictionary and English Literature for Boys and Girls, thus to encourage consumers to purchase at the same time, which would definitely bring higher profit.

It goes the same with ?Packaged Services? in mobile industry. By association analysis, we could find the correlation between various mobile services (as known as wireless services), then make a combination for users who are not familiar with them to help save their time and money.

And we could also recommend another complementary service to those who have already purchased some services, for example, to recommend an Mp3 Audio Book to those who have just bought the text version.

2) Personalized Services: The digital content industry of network era has regained the ?niche? essence of publishing.

The Long Tail theory tells us that in the time of digital, a small minority of the total publishing resources takes in the aggregate control of a significant share of market sale, which means customers no longer just care about mainstream bestsellers, but also in needs of more personalized, more user-friendly, more diverse and comfortable services.

Personalized service, or one-to one marketing, is concisely to provide the most satisfactory products and services around customers needs based on their personal information (such as age, profession, occupation and income). For example, we could build two-dimensional association rule like ?women around 20 are more likely to purchase beauty books?, ?students whose major is database are more likely to buy SQL server books?, thus to recommend relevant products that consumers may be interested in through e-mails.

3) Service Exploration: Association analysis actually is in development itself. It could increase species diversity of digital publishing services, to extent its tentacles everywhere it could help besides qualitative leap.

Spatial association rule mining, for example, is one kind of association analysis best known for Web Map Service [9], especially in auto car navigation and mobile location-based services, which are relatively more mature overseas. By building spatial association rules, association matrix and other related technologies [7], we could make spatial analysis and reasoning for further reformation of spatial- based services.

Another research direction is association analysis for text.

Currently there exists a big problem in extracting knowledge from semi-structured and unstructured data [6] (e.g. the abstracts and introductions of papers). When it comes to association analysis, we could find the relationships by collection and sorting keywords, which would help classify the documents automatically.

Association analysis for multimedia is also one of current issues, which is inevitable with Internet bandwidth growth, and even more different than text data mining [6].

Multimedia association analysis is admittedly everywhere, such as association rule-based content image retrieval, the relations between video shots, etc. There have developed move mining system, medical video mining system [10], MultimediaMiner (a data mining system prototype) which could mine out the knowledge about image content, video layering, movie classification and so on.

For these new services listed above, some are already at the maturity stage, while others still remain laboratory products. They share the focus of data mining research though. When they?re well-developed, it could undoubtedly be of great help to digital content industry.



V. CASE STUDY ON ASSOCIATION ANALYSIS OF INTERNET USERS  We are now to make a user association analysis focusing on Internet Usage Data (for details, check ?http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Internet+Usage+Data?) provided by UCI Machine Learning Repository, thus to find out the hidden interesting pattern among user attributes.  The whole process has three steps:  A. Pre-precession In the first step, we remove some attributes which have  no use for our target. Also, we discrete ?Age? a numeric (continuous) variable to nominal data, as well as delete certain instances with null or invalied value(s). consequently, we develop a refined dataset with 4387 records and 8 attributes (?Age?, ?Education_Attainment?, ?Gender?, ?Household_Income?, ?Major_Occupation?, ?Marital_Status?, ?Web_Ordering? and ?Willingness_to_Pay_Fees?), the number of values in sequence is as Table show:  TABLE I.  THE NUMBER OF ATTRIBUTE VALUES     NAME 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  NR 5 9 2 8 5 7 2 6  B. Pattern Discovery Secondly, derive association rules from these instances.

In this step, Weka generates 28 multidimensional rules at the support threshold of 0.1 and confidence of 0.7. e.g.

?Major_Occupation=Other Marital_Status=Married ==> Willingness_to_Pay_Fees=Already_paying  sup (0.11), conf (0.81)?.

C. Model Evaluation The last step is also called redundancy reduction, that is,  to remove the rules that seem no use or cannot meet our needs by experience. In the end, we find these 4 rules may be useful for web design improvement:  Rule1: Major_Occupation=Computer ==> Web_Ordering=Yes  sup (0.14), conf (0.79)  Rule2: Gender=Male Household_Income=$50-74 ==> Web_Ordering=Yes  sup (0.10), conf (0.76)  Rule3: Marital_Status=Single Web_Ordering=Yes ==> Gender=Male  sup (0.16), conf (0.72)  Rule4: Age='(35-50]' Marital_Status=Married ==> Web_Ordering=Yes  sup (0.14), conf (0.71)  According to these rules above, we could make advices or suggestions to web designers, like:  ? create a sidebar about computer education books on certain web pages;  ? make some super-links to online shops for men who have a household income of $50-74;  ? place approaches to online dating sites; ? recommend household goods to the marrieds  between the ages of 35 and 50.

Therefore, we can see that the GUIs (Graphical User  Interface) for digital publishing websites could be optimized and improved, which would provide more user-friendly and human-based services.



VI. CONCLUSION Digital content industry is gradually maturing, and  customers? attraction are more like to be drawn with more rich and varied resources at the upstream industrial chain.

But if these resources fail to meet their needs or be accepted by a fair portion of the markets, it is all in vane. No matter  how excellent and perfect the resources are, they still cannot fully achieve their economic and social values. Therefore, the consumers at the downstream industrial chain are in fact the beginning of the industry with their needs constituting the entire market demand. So it is confirmed that if we want to maximize value creation of digital content industry, we?d better transform ?passive? service to ?active? ones with the establishment of ?users as the core, products and services as two wings? business model.

While as an advanced data processing technology, association analysis has an endless amount of potential in digital content industry. Digital publishers could make the resource more systematic and scientific to realize their own cultural value; in the meantime, they could develop more user-friendly, personalized, diversified services to realize their own economic value. So there is no doubt that business intelligence will play an increasingly important role in the future of digital content industry, especially association analysis which could dig out the hidden industrial potential, as well as to provide a broader development space.
