A Content Centric Approach to Energy Efficient Data Dissemination

Abstract?Planet scale growth in deployment of mobile and interconnected devices interacting in a participatory sensing, collection and dissemination of information, have motivated interest in the Internet of Things. Therefore, the problem of information overload and big data becomes inherent. In this paper we intend to propose a methodology aiming at a lower processing overhead towards an energy efficient method for networking of information in larger systems. We consider a content-centric networking paradigm that is aimed at enhancing the dissemination of information and eliminating many problems of host based communication. The proposed method is based on a network coding approach which leverages the spectral characteristics of network topology. We argue that topology of interacting nodes within a cluster can influence the performance of network coding from a computational complexity perspective and therefore the overall energy consumption in a system. We propose an algorithm that takes an opportunistic strategy to utilize the social structure and spectral characteristics of the network topology based on our design of a multicast coding network that reduces the number of encoding nodes.



I. INTRODUCTION  The emergence of cloud computing and rapid increase in creation and dissemination of information over the Internet, evolved the society to consider the Internet as a source of information and services that is delivered to them by the network. The future internet is facing the problem of infor- mation overload and the existing networking solutions may not be able to cope with the rapid increase in the amount of information available. Cyber physical systems and ubiquity of sensors, devices, and embedded systems has lead to the transition towards the networking of information as opposed to networking of devices. This calls for a transition from an end-to-end communication paradigm to a content-based networking paradigm. The potential of this shift in the Internet architecture could be significant, since it impacts both the communication model and the network infrastructure. Content- based networking, also known as content-aware, Content- centric Networking (CCN) [1], information-centric or data- oriented networking, aims at using the network layer to pro- vide content to the users instead of providing a communication channel between hosts. While this shift in the networking paradigm is advantageous, there are challenges associated with dissemination of information for larger scale systems. Current  host based networking solution may not cope with intermittent connectivity and reliable transport of relevant data.

A number of research projects in Europe and North America are also investigating the content-centric approach for the future internet and propose a data-centric architecture for the future internet. Examples are PSIRP [2], CCN [1], NetInf [3], 4WARD [4], and DONA [5]. Although they all differ in their architecture designs, they share the same goal in developing a content distribution approach to cope with heterogeneity of networks, disruptions and disconnections.

In content-based communication, information will be tar- geted towards a specific set of interested nodes rather than hosts that are identified by their location. This shift in paradigm can be described with the past trend in networks from circuit switched networks to packet switched networks and then to a content centric paradigm. In circuit switched networks, for any end-to-end communication there is a ded- icated connection. With the increased demand in telephony, Voice over IP (VoIP) and data communication, circuit switched solution was no longer sufficient. In the packet switched approach, data items move in separate smaller blocks called packets or datagrams according to the destination address and other identifiers in the packet. Similar trend implies that the existing IP-based connection approach may not be sufficient in response to the increasing demand for content, leading the way to a shift in paradigm where the end points of communication are no longer relevant and transparent. Current method of com- munication is based on a conversational model of interaction.

The distinction between dissemination and conversation lies on the fact that it is important to disseminate data to relevant requester and making the underlying mechanism agnostic. As long as the request is satisfied it is not important where it comes from.

A. Contribution  In this paper we identify the challenge of big data problem for large systems as applicable to the Internet of Things (IoT) and cyber physical systems in the future internet. We argue that it can be solved by changing the networking paradigm towards the idea of network of information. We intend to propose an energy efficient solution to dissemination of information for     large systems. Our proposed algorithm is based on an oppor- tunistic approach to perform network coding on selected nodes within a cluster. The decision is made by taking the social connectivity of participating nodes into account. We argue that knowing about the spectral characteristics [6] of topology can assist in an energy efficient design of multicast coding network which yields to limiting the number of encoding nodes. One of the overheads with network coding is that nodes must have the processing capability to perform arithmetic operations over a finite field in real time. This processing will determine whether a decoded content chunk is innovative and makes a decision to either encode, forward, or decode. The following criteria contribute to the computational cost. Number of nodes that perform network coding, number of operations and number of transmitted packets.



II. RELATED WORK  Energy efficient data dissemination has been investigated in the context of sensor networks. A location aided method is proposed in [7] with a protocol that is based on the location information to reduce redundant transmissions. A recent work in [8] addressed energy efficiency in data dissemination for the internet of things. Another work [9] proposed an algorithm that supports transmission of spatial data and process queries based on their location.

The advantages of network coding for energy efficiency have been investigated in the literature. Authors in [10] investigated benefits of network coding in terms of energy efficiency and showed that network coding can offer more efficient broadcasting over ad hoc wireless networks. They have shown that network coding can be advantageous while it offers a constant gain over a fixed topology, and a log n factor of benefit over a network with dynamic topology. Another paper [11], proposed a network coding based broadcast method by combining network coding with the Connected Dominating Set (CDS)-based broadcasting. The intuition behind their proposed scheme is to intersect information flows at nodes in CDS to increase the coding opportunities.

The traditional approach to content distribution in large networks is based on the end-to-end client server approach.

Content Delivery (Distribution) Networks (CDN) aim at min- imizing the request response time to deliver the content to users. They perform in a distributed client server approach by caching the content items in some geographically distributed servers (e.g. Akamai).

Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks also offer a distributed and collaborative architecture for content distribution. In a col- laborative content dissemination model, a population of users are interested in retrieving a content item while the server capabilities and resources are limited. Therefore, the content items are split into blocks of information and disseminated to users and users collaboratively reconstruct the items by exchanging the blocks of information (e.g. BitTorrent [12]).

The problem of content dissemination has been studied from the perspective of coding complexity in [13]. The au- thors use the LT-based network coding approach to achieve  a better decoding performance for situations where nodes posses less processing capabilities such as sensor networks.

Content dissemination problem in content-centric networking is approached by [14] with a solution based on a directed diffusion method according to the interest in a content item from the nearest location that is aimed at improving the robustness against network failures and disruptions.

A content routing protocol is proposed by [15] aimed to be adaptable to large scale networks. This method is based on request filtering and content dissemination and the design is based on achieving a compromise between the matching efficiency and the cost of communication.



III. CONTENT CENTRIC NETWORKING  Independent of any specific architecture, there are common components that are important as building blocks of a content- centric networking paradigm [1]:  ? Content: is referred to any type and volume of raw data that can be combined, mixed or aggregated to generate new content.

? Information object: Information is a higher level abstrac- tion of raw data that can be obtained by aggregating, processing, mixing of data.

? Naming: can be looked at in the context of node model in CCN. According to [1] there are two CCN packet types, Interest packet and Data packet.

? Routing and transport: In CCN routing is based on the name of the content. Transport in CCN is designed to operate on top of unreliable packet delivery service. There are mechanisms that can prevent looping and duplicate of interest packets.

? Security: In CCN the idea of content-based security is adapted where protection and trust is embedded in the content instead of securing the communication channel.

In CCN, the node model consists of two types of packets.

First type is called Interest packets and and the other is called Data packets. Interest packets are broadcast to available con- nected neighbors for the purpose of querying a data packet. A data packet satisfies an interest if the prefix of the contentName field in the data packet matches the contentName field of the interest packet.



IV. PROPOSED METHOD  Network coding is a general case of routing. In network coding approach, a linear combination of received packets are transmitted at the egress while routing only performs a forwarding with no arithmetic operations performed. Inherent multipath support in a content-centric networking paradigm makes network coding a suitable approach. The results pre- sented in [16] argue that linear coding with finite base field suffices to achieve the Max-flow Min-cut bound for multicast.

Another advantage of network coding is energy efficiency as discussed in [17]. The key ingredient of our approach is lever- aging the spectral characteristics of network for selecting the key player nodes for performing network coding. Specifically, we show that in the networks with good expansion properties,    our decentralized approach yields a better reliability and less computational cost. The motivation behind the proposed method is that with a content-centric networking architecture, network coding can be deployed for a better utilization of redundant capacity. On the other hand, information about the spectral characteristics of chosen clusters can be utilized for a more efficient data dissemination based on social interaction and connectivity of participating nodes.

A. Spectral Characteristics of Network Topology  For a finite undirected graph G = (V,E), the adjacency matrix AG is defined as [6]:  Aij =  { 1 if i and j are adjacent 0 otherwise  For the adjacency matrix AG of graph G and the identity matrix I and ? being a scalar, then the determinant |AG??I| which is called the characteristic polynomial of AG. The roots of |AG ? ?I| = 0 are called the eigenvalues of G.

Considering the network topology defined earlier as a graph G = (V,E), the spectrum of the graph is the set of the eigenvalues ?1, ?2, ..., ?k of the adjacency matrix of the graph.

The spectral gap of G is defined as (d ? ?2). The spectral gap of a graph is a measure of the spectral expansion of that graph. It is assumed that such graphs are connected. Different connected graphs have different spectral parameters. In this work, we are interested in high expansion parameters and lower degrees [6]. The Laplacian of graph G is defined as LG where  Lij =  ??? di if i = j?Aij if i 6= j and (i, j) is an edge 0 Otherwise  The Laplacian LG has at least one zero eigenvalue, and their multiplicity is an indication of the number of disjoint paths in a graph.

B. Model  We base our model of information flow at the content chunk level rather than the IP packet level [1]. In this paradigm, data chunks for a content item can be received from multiple sources and nodes with different constraints and characteristics. In the following we briefly go over some of the preliminaries. We consider the network as a directed graph G = (V,E) where V is the set of vertices (nodes) and E is the set of edges (links). A link l ? E can be thought of a a pair (i, j) ? E representing the link from node i to node j, where node j is the destination and node i is the source of link l = (i, j) ? E.

The network performs linear operations and linear coding on the flow of information. Therefore, it can be represented as a state space description consisting of the coupling at the source and destination as well as the adjacency matrix of the graph as the following standard form:  Y = FX +BU  Z = AX (1)  where Y denotes the intermediate random processes, F is adjacency matrix of the graph for the network, B describes the coupling between the source nodes to the network and A describes the coupling of the system to the sink nodes. The following describes the above mentioned matrices. For each source i, the 1? |E| matrix Ai can be defined as  Ai,j =  { ai,lj if lj ? ?out(si)  0 otherwise  where ?out is the outdegree edge, and ?in is the indegree edge.

The coupling at the destinations is described as  Bi,j =  { blj ,i if lj ? ?in(zi)  0 otherwise  and finally the matrix describing the network can be written as  Fi,j =  { fli,lj if head(li) = tail(lj) i.e. adjacent  0 otherwise  The global transfer matrix M for the system can be written as follows [18]:  M = A(I ? F )?1BT (2)  where I is the |E| ? |E| identity matrix.

We assume that any of the interfaces can act as egress if  there is another node connected with an interest on any specific content. It implies that not all nodes are required to be a CCN node, but it may suffice to act as a relay node. Forwarding at each node is performed as follows:  1) At the initial time the source sends data chunk i of popularity class k to all the faces configured as egress.

2) We assume that based on the CCN approach, if identical chunks are received at the incident links, only one chunk will be considered for forwarding or coding.

3) An intermediate node that performs coding should have the following condition. The indegree of v should be greater than the outdegree of v i.e. d?(v) > d+(v).

In other words there are more incident links acting as ingress than egress.

4) Any node known as a CCN router will perform the ran- dom linear coding on the received chunks and forwards via eligible egress faces. Assuming that the router is content-aware, it will forward to the interfaces incident to nodes that are interested in the content item.

Step 3 ensures a less computational cost on any two clusters, where the receivers are at one end, by introducing a lower rank at the intermediate step. In the above mentioned, the intuition is finding the best expander graph for a cluster. One of deterministic measures of expansion is the Cheeger constant [6] of a graph that can be defined as follows.

h(C) = |?(X)| vol(X)  where ?(X) is the edge boundary of X and defined as  ?(X) = {{u, v} ? E : u ? X, v /? X}    In our proposed solution we are interested in clusters that possess a greater degree of expansion yielding a higher con- nectivity and lower complexity for a large system. In other words, a good expander implies a linear growth of the number of edges with the size of network.

hG = max C?G  h(C)  We demonstrate in the next section that by minimizing the solution to the best expander, we will succeed in minimizing the number of nodes with higher processing demand. It can be done by leveraging the spectral characteristics of the topology that is inferred by the social structure of participating nodes.

Since the intermediate nodes are content aware, knowledge about type of content and predicate of requested content can help in determining the receivers with common set of queries.

Let ? denote the data chunk distinction factor, indicating the number of distinct data chunks in terms of attributes as in the CCN interest packet. Each CCN node taking the responsibility of encoding, and forwards the data chunks to the interfaces according to the received interest packet queries. It can be shown that by selectively encoding of packets based on their targeted receivers, the maximum number of encoding nodes can be significantly reduced.



V. ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION  In this section we discuss the impact of CCN as a net- working paradigm. In addition, the impacts of complexity and processing cost on the performance of system is analyzed.

A. Content Distribution Efficiency  The efficiency of content dissemination in CCN arises with the situation of larger number receivers and sink nodes. The experiment done in [1] has shown that TCP scales linearly with increasing the number of sink nodes while CCN follows a constant scale. Since TCP traffic is per connection, as the number of connections increase, download completion time gets larger. However, in the CCN approach, the traffic would cross the path only once. As discussed and evaluated in [1], it is important to consider that although the performance penalty of using CCN due to its packet overhead vs. TCP is around 20%, the performance gain for the case of larger sink nodes is integer multiples.

B. Complexity  The processing cost for a network coding based approach in large systems can be extensive since nodes must have the processing capability to perform arithmetic operations over finite fields in real time. This processing will determine whether a decoded content chunk is innovative and makes a decision to either encode, forward, or decode. The processing complexity involved in operations over fields depends on the size of each generation h, and size of the field n [19]. It takes O(h2) operations in F2n for linear operations with generations of size h. Multiplications and inversions over field F2n is of complexity O(n2). Furthermore, matrix inversions and Gaussian elimination to solve the system takes O(h3).

!"#$% !"#$&  !"#$"  Fig. 1: Rank factorization yielding O(r(m+ n))  When the random network coding approach is chosen, the probability of success at the destination is also a critical factor in addition to the processing complexity. Breaking the system into clusters and performing network coding selectively on nodes or clusters, can reduce the complexity by means of rank factorization as shown in Figure 1.

Therefore, the complexity in such approach is O(r(m+n)) as opposed to the other case where complexity is O(mn).

Therefore, in choosing the right cluster the intermediate rank r is an important factor. The complexity of encoding is affected by the number of nodes that are required to perform network coding. The number of nodes that are required to perform coding in order to deliver h packets to a set of k terminals is bounded by h3k2. In a gossip based algorithm for network coding the maximum number of encoding nodes for ? distinct data chunks is O(?3h3k2). By cluster based selective encoding approach of CCN, the rank of this system will be factorized to O(?h3k2).

Fig. 2: Maximum number of encoding nodes with respect to the number of data items  The expansion factor of a graph can be described as the minimum ?surface-to-volume? ratio of any subset of nodes and can be represented by the measures of expansion.

We considered three types of network topologies, fully connected graph, random graph where nodes are connected with probability p and expander graph which is typically assumed to be a finite graph. As the system grows, complexity can be derived with the relations in Table I. As shown in Figure 3 the cost of processing scales linearly with the size of network for the case of a good expander.

VI. CONCLUSION  In this paper we raised the problem of information overload for applications and services of the future internet. It constitutes a large system with a large amount of participating nodes. A context-aware methodology for utilizing the topology of information can lead to a more efficient dissemination of information. An instance of this is the concept of Internet of Things. We elaborated on the concept of networking information ( i.e. content-centric model of communication) and showed that this shift in the networking paradigm is advantageous. Content-centric paradigm implies that the intermediate nodes are content-aware. We proposed an algorithm based on an enhanced network coding scheme that leverage the spectral characteristics of the network topology to minimize the number encoding within the system and reducing the computational cost. We discussed the impact of topology of interacting nodes within a cluster and how it can influence the performance of network coding from  a computational complexity perspective and therefore the overall energy consumption in a system. Our evaluation and analysis justified the networking of information for large systems as well as processing cost reduction within the entire system.
