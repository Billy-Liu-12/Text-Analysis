Study on the Telecommunication Technology Based on the  Distributed Satellite Constellation Networks

Abstract-By the motive of the application in the commercial and military regions, the telecommunication  technologies have been developed further more in recent  years, for the purpose of better performance. Compared  with the terrestrial networks, the satellite constellation  networks could provide higher communication coverage,  faster data transmission rate and more reliable data  transmission service under the given quality of service  requirements, which would be widely used in the regions of  distance education, tele-commanding, telemedicine, etc.

In this paper, firstly we introduce the characteristics and structures of the distributed satellite networks (DSN),  which are composed by the LEO satellites, GEO satellites,  and the ground terminals. The GEO satellites are  responsible for the operation and management of the DSN  network, the LEO satellites are responsible for providing  the telecommunication services for the ground terminals,  including the source users and the destination users. Then,  in order to provide the more reliable and faster  telecommunication services, we suggest a new distributed  dynamic source routing (DSR) algorithm based on the  thought of flood-routing. The dynamic source routing  algorithm in the distributed satellite constellation network  (DSN-DSR) is one on-demand routing algorithm utilizing  the source routing method between the satellite nodes but  not the hop-by-hop routing method. The algorithm is  composed of two main mechanisms of Route Discovery and  Route Maintenance, which work together to allow source  nodes to discover and maintain the source routes to any  destination nodes in the distributed satellite constellation  networks. While, compared with the earth nodes, satellite  nodes are limited by the on-board processing, storage, and  so on. In this paper, we suggest other two mechanisms to  solve the problem: one is the Route Cache, and the other is  the GEO Agency, which could reduce the size of memory  on-board and improve the system performance potentially.

Finally, in order to insure the security and credibility  during the telecommunication procedure in the satellite  constellation networks, the mechanism of information  security and credibility based on the concept of autonomous  domain with perceptive interaction is developed, which  could be called the multi-level and active security  protection mechanism, the key points of our research on the  security and credibility include three aspects: first, the  "inner-edge" security and credibility system of the  autonomous domain; second, the active defense with  multifarious techniques; third, the multi-level defending  based on the safety grade evaluation.

In order to verify the new telecommunication architecture  and data transmission approaches, we have done some  theoretical works to prove its availability in the distributed  satellite constellation networks, and make use of the simulation  tools to build the simulation platform of the "terminals + LEOs  + GEOs" telecommunication situation. The theoretical analysis  and the simulation results shows that, compared with other  architectures and algorithms such as the only LEO satellites or  only GEO satellites constellation networks, standard Dijkstra  algorithm, and so on, our new telecommunication architecture  and data transmission approaches could decrease the data  transmission time-delay and make the network status more  stable, and remarkably improve the telecommunication  performance in the distributed satellite constellation networks.
