Research on Incubation Mechanism of  Entrepreneurs in the Industrial Cluster

Abstract- The problem of entrepreneurship in industrial clusters has increasingly become the focal question in the study of regional economy. By investigating and studying the cases of the entrepreneurs from five big industrial clusters in our country, the paper proposes the incubation subjects, incubation environments and incubation atmospheres of the enterprising talents in industrial clusters, builds the evaluation cables of industrial clusters? venture incubation and venture performance, and tests its reliability and validity. Furthermore, multiple linear regression analysis method is applied to analyze the influences of venture incubation factors on venture performance in industrial clusters. Eight factors such as venture incubation subjects, incubation environments and incubation atmospheres are taken as multiple independent variables; two dimensions of venture performance are taken as dependent variables; and then all entry regression analysis method is applied to build a multiple linear regression equation of venture performance. All of the above studies have tested the influences and associate effects of the entrepreneurs? incubation system in industrial clusters on the venture performance and have revealed the mechanism of this system.

I. INTRODUCTION   Recognized as an important force of driving the regional  economy forward, entrepreneurship has been increasingly paid attention to in various countries and regions. The enterprising talents, as a result, are gradually becoming the core driving force of technological innovation and economic growth. Nowadays in our country, with the shortage of supplies in the job market, the increasingly competitive environment of employment and the gradually detailed differentiation of trades, new industrial opportunities have begun to spring up. Meanwhile, people?s spirits of adventure and innovation increase daily. More than ever, they long for further annotating their potential values in an adventurous and quick way. As a result, more and more people join in the self-employed teams.

The occurrence rate and success rate of entrepreneurship in industrial clusters is much higher than that of in the isolated regions. Eleven new companies are established in the Silicon Valley every week. It has quickly become the world class information industrial clusters within a few decades. Also in our country, more than 3000 new enterprises are registered in Zhongguancun every year at the present time; in Wuhan Optical Valley, 2048 enterprises have been registered since the Valley was established in 2005, which means that 5.6 enterprises come into being every day. Why do industrial clusters can become the  catalytic area and incubator to the enterprising talents? What are the factors in industrial clusters that can incubate the enterprising talents? How does the mechanism work? These questions are the key points to reveal the fundamental reasons of the enterprising talents? development and the sustainable development of industrial clusters.



II. RESEARCH THINKING AND THEORETICAL  MODEL   A. Accumulation and Incubation of Enterprising Talents in Industrial Clusters  1) The accumulative effects of industrial clusters are the power source of attracting and accumulating enterprising talents. Krugman(1991) held the opinion that compared to the other enterprises, the accumulative effects of industrial clusters could provide the enterprises more competitive advantages in aspects of skilled labor force supply, raw materials supply, transportation cost, products pricing, profit space, infrastructure and so on. These advantages had encouraged those enterprising talents to join in industrial clusters to carve their careers [1]. Bahrami and Evans (2000) proposed that in industrial clusters, the factors such as superior environments, venture capitals, social capitals, entrepreneurial spirits and so on had decreased the difficulty of starting a business. As a result, large quantities of entrepreneurs were attracted to join in them [2]. Scholars in our country Zhao Jiangming and Liu Jinhong(2004) argued that during the process of industrial accumulation, the entrepreneurial activities could be mutually affected  with each other and could form a benign interaction. The centralization of entrepreneurship had lowered the risks of establishing new businesses and that of entering into new areas. It had also increased the opportunities and resources that could promote the possibilities of success. The interaction of Entrepreneurs? acts and regional environments had boosted the evolution and development of industrial clusters [3]. Researchers included Mai Yiyuan and so on (2007) also thought that industrial clusters had possessed fairly perfect entrepreneurial mechanism which was centrally embodied in the superior environments and entrepreneurial platforms. These advantages could spur the enterprising talents on to success [4]. The innovative advantages of industrial clusters themselves make them have entrepreneurial advantages as well. This is also one of the factors that have produced a higher rate of business start-ups in industrial clusters.

2) Industrial clusters become the incubator of enterprising talents. The concept of incubator came into  - 302 -    being in America, of which the original meaning is a cabinet used for eggs or premature infants. Under well-controlled temperatures, humidity and stability, the fragile new life within incubation periods can grow up smoothly in the incubator. Industrial clusters have the innate strength of enterprising talents? incubation. By studying Silicon Valley and 128 Highway in Boston, Saxenian(1994) demonstrated industrial clusters? stimulating effects on enterprising activities from the aspects of knowledge spillover and social capital [5]. Zhang Hui(2003) proposed that the learning effects in industrial clusters could, on one hand, lower the threshold of starting businesses. Particularly, the learning effects provided the convenient conditions of technologies, capitals, labor forces, entrepreneurships, market expanding and so on to help to the derivation and development of enterprises in industrial clusters. On the other hand, the quick generalization of the producing skills and managerial experience which were on the bottom of the learning linear could also greatly decrease the risks of starting new businesses [6]. By studying the developmental process of featured Massive Economic in Zhejiang, Hu Jianji and Chen Haibin(2005) concluded that abundant Formless Supplies, nongovernmental credit system bred by kinships and nostalgias and well network structures formed along the history had strengthened the social capital of potential entrepreneurs, which, as a result, greatly increased the possibilities of enterprising success [7]. Industrial cluster is a special economic region whose resources are relatively centralized. As a result, the chance of seeking new low cost plans greatly increases. More relative experience and ability accumulations spur the generations of abundant entrepreneurs and new enterprises. On the other hand, the local entrepreneurial spirits further stimulate entrepreneurships and innovations. Therefore, industrial clusters can incubate entrepreneurs continuously.

B. Incubation System for the Enterprising Talents in Industrial Clusters  In industrial clusters, incubation of enterprising talents is a complicated system with multiple dimensions. Michael. E.

Porter (1990) explained the implication of industrial cluster Industrial cluster not only includes those manufacturing and operating enterprises which are engaged in a particular industry directly, but also includes various behavioral actors which can support those enterprises both directly and indirectly, such as governments, universities, financial institutions, research institutions, trade organizations, vocational training center and so on. These subjects can provide professional trainings, educations, information, researches and technical assistance.?[8] By studying the industrial cluster of American biotechnology, Feldman (2001) proposed that in one region, enterprising talents were of shortage at the very beginning. And then it was gradually developed into a full-function region, including the transition of foundation and the transition from innovation system inner into more efficient system [9].

In fact, no region?s development can be achieved by one isolated behavioral actor. It is the results of all kinds of activities? interactions among various subjects? from both inner and outer region. Industrial cluster is only an effective economic organization form to ensure that all the interacted activities among different behavioral actors are of high  efficiency. Every subject in an industrial cluster is not isolated from each other. On the contrary, they are connected closely through regional network. This regional network is a relation scheme that seems to be closed in the industrial clusters which, in fact, are still connected with the outside. Seen from the angle of resource endowment, industrial cluster is a regional mode of resource deployment, in which, all the resources inner one region are effectively organized in a best way to be engaged in the most advantageous economical activities for this region. The functions of industrial clusters on entrepreneurs? incubation are mainly embodied in the incubation of subjects, stimulation of environment and the catalysis of atmosphere, which are shown in the Fig. I below.

Fig. 1. Incubation System and Incubation Effects for the Entrepreneurs in  Industrial Clusters   .  VARIABLE DESIGN AND MEASUREMENTS   A. Construction of indexes system Based on the discussions above, it can be seen that in  industrial clusters, the incubation subjects, environments an atmospheres of entrepreneurs formed in the various institutions and faculties will impact on the venture performance of entrepreneurs. In this part of discussion, the writer intends to explore what on earth these impacts are and thereby reveal the entrepreneurs? incubation mechanism in industrial clusters.

Upon the design of independent variables, Hugh (1994) held the opinion that the incubation environment of entrepreneurship generally includes five aspects: venture cultural atmosphere, venture incubation network, venture policy support, investment and financing environment and infrastructure services [10]. By adopting the Joint Production Theory, Resources Theory, Network Theory and so on, Wang Zhongming emphatically analyzed the effective operating mode of enterprises incubator in boosting the establishment and development of venture companies, thereby proposed the six critical elements which had made the enterprises incubator successfully work, including team management, supportive services, environment supports, specialized services and performance mode of the incubator [11]. By studying the empirical data, Zhang Wei and Xing Xiao (2007) analyzed and tested the  Industrial Cluster  Incubation System of  Entrepreneurs Incubation  subject  Incubation environme  nt  Incubation atmospher  e  Venture perfor- mance  Incubation  Stimulation  Catalysis  Government & various  institutions  Commercial & living facilities  Innovative & entrepreneurial  atmosphere  - 303 -    relationship between high-tech venture incubation environment and venture growth performance in our country.

The results indicated that four critical factors of venture incubation environment would remarkably influence the venture growth performance of high technology enterprises, including venture cultural atmosphere, venture incubation network, venture policy support and infrastructure services [12]. Some scholars have studied upon one particular venture environment. Powers and McDougall proposed that universities or scientific research institutions are important channels for enterprises to obtain technologies. Enterprises could obtain technologies through purchasing universities and scientific research institutions? patents. Or they are also get technologies through collaborative research with universities or scientific research institutions. Universities and scientific research institutions had provided the newly founded enterprises with well environment of technology research and development and technology spread.

Rosenstein, Bruno, By grave and Taylor(1993) proposed that risk investment is an important channel of new enterprises? financing. Referring to the research results in venture environment and venture mechanism of industrial clusters by Krugman (1991), Bahrami and Evans(2000), Wang Zhongming(2004) and so on, they divided the incubation subjects into five dimensions: government subjects, scientific subjects, information and finance subjects, consultation service subjects and market subjects, 26 indexes in total. The incubation environment was divided into three dimensions: municipal facilities environment, business environment and living environment, three indexed in total. The venture incubation atmosphere was divided into three dimensions: encouraging innovation, tolerating failure and setting examples to motivate, five indexes in total.

Upon the design of dependent variables, foreign and domestic scholars test the venture performance from subjective and objective dimensions. Chandler and Hanks proposed that the relationship between venture performance and entrepreneurs could be understood from individuals, organizations and environments [13]. Venkatraman and Ramanujam proposed that the subjective performance could be measured from enterprises? non-financial goals and rough success rate while the objective performance could be measured from some objective financial indexes such as sales growth, personnel growth and return of investment and so on. Researchers like Wall (2004) in particular studied the validity of adopting subjective assessment method to measure the enterprises? financial performance and found that this method had fine converge validity for measuring the enterprises? performance [14]. Referring to the research findings by Venkatraman and Ramaujam, Wall and so on, the writer will measure the venture performance in two dimensions in this thesis: entrepreneur?s individual growth performance and the related enterprise?s operation performance, ten indexes in total.

B. Small Sample Test and Form of Indexes System For the sake of testing the validity and reliability of  entrepreneurs? incubation index system in industrial clusters in this paper, some enterprises from Henan Xuchang Periwig industrial cluster, Wuhan Optical Valley industrial cluster and Xiantao Non-woven industrial cluster were  picked to be tested. 102 questionnaires were delivered and 89 valid questionnaires were collected. Likert scale was adopted in the questionnaire, in which 5 represented very important, 4 represented relatively important, 3 represented not sure, 2 represented not very important and 1 represented unimportant. The Statistical Software SPSS18.0 was used for analyzing the indexes system?s reliability of entrepreneurs? incubation factors in industrial clusters which was proposed in the thesis and estimating and revising the system meanwhile.

Cronbach?s ? was adopted to measure the scale reliability.

The Cronbach?s ? of the whole questionnaire was 0.841, greater than 0.8; and every sub item?s Cronbach?s ? was over 0.70. Therefore, the scale?s internal reliability in this thesis is overall high; and the reliabilities of each factor used for exploratory study were also acceptable.

Through statistic analysis of all the measurements, it was found that among the revised items? relevance, the relevance between ?the services provided by Medias and advertisements inner industrial clusters? and ?natural resources of industrial clusters? was below 0.4, of which the index centrality was a little bit lower. The Cronbach?s ? was improved after the two items were deleted. Chuechill (1979) proposed that if the total relevance of the items was below 0.4, and the Cronbach?s ? was improved after the related items were deleted, then the related items should be deleted.

Based on the statement, I decided to do exploratory factor analysis on the new established cable so that each measurement item could be clarified. After the clarification, the evaluation indexes system of entrepreneurs? incubation in industrial clusters includes 7 variables and 32 indexes.

. RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS   The research was conducted through depth interviews and  questionnaires. More than 300 questionnaires were delivered to the entrepreneurs from the industrial clusters of Wenzhou Leather, Wuhan Optical Valley, Xuchang Periwig, Xiantao Non-woven, Dongguan IT and so on. 284 valid questionnaires were collected, among which, 85.6% of the respondents were males while 14.4% of them are females.

Their ages and education backgrounds are shown in Table 1 below.

TABLE I  Age and Educations backgrounds of the Respondents  Age Sample  size Educatio  n Sample  size Working  years Sample  size  Below  (4.9%)  Junior high & below  (13.7%)  (5.2%)  31-40  (16.5%) Senior high  (20.4%)  (12.0%)  41-50  (35.2%) College degree  (32.7%)  (18.3%)  51-60  (29.6%) Bachelor ?s degree  (26.1%)  (44.1%)  Over  (13.7%)  Master and  above  (7.0%)  (20.4%)    - 304 -    Aiming at the entrepreneurs? incubation factors in industrial clusters, this paper extracted the data of those valid questionnaires to conduct factor analysis by adopting the principle component method. Meanwhile, the results of ordinal measurement were transferred to factor scores as backups to multiple regression analysis. The KMO (Kaiser Meyer Olkin) value was 0.816; the observation of Bartlett test of sphericity statistics was 1327.973.the variable was suitable for factor analysis. The lowest index of communalities? extractions also reached 0.478, which indicated that the evaluation indexes of this questionnaire had obvious impacts on entrepreneurs? incubation and the questionnaire?s design was reliable and appropriate as well.

Under the circumstance of initial factors? solution, 8 factors? Eigen values exceeded 1, whose cumulative contribution of variance accounted to 75.234%. Therefore, extracting 8 factors can explain most information of the original variables and the information loss is less. At last, Varimax was introduced to orthogonally rotate the load matrix so as to make the factors nameable. In test of reliability, Cronbach?s ? are all over 0.7. The indexes values of every measurement are shown in Table 4 in the end of the article.

Similarly, exploratory factor analysis was conducted on the questionnaires of venture performance, in which, the principle component analysis and varimax orthogonal rotation were adopted to extract factors. The standard was: the Eigen value exceeded 1 and the factors? loadings of the items were not less than 0.5. Two critical factors were extracted. Meanwhile, some items which located in two dimensions crosswise and had a little bit higher factors? loadings were deleted. Finally, the venture performance evaluation scale had two dimensions, 5 items in each dimension respectively, 10 items in total. The results are shown in Table 2 below.

However, factors in different dimensions have different effect intensions, therefore, the following hypothesis are proposed:  H1a: Government subjects in industrial clusters have remarkable positive effects on both individual and organizational venture performance.

H1b: Consulting service subjects in industrial clusters have remarkable positive effects on both individual and organizational venture performance.

H1c: NGO subjects in industrial clusters have remarkable positive effects on both individual and organizational venture performance.

H1d: Education research subjects in industrial clusters have remarkable positive effects on both individual and organizational venture performance.

H1e: Information and finance subjects in industrial clusters have remarkable positive effects on both individual and organizational venture performance.

H1f: market subjects in industrial clusters have remarkable positive effects on both individual and organizational venture performance.

H2: Venture environment in industrial clusters have remarkable positive effects on both individual and organizational venture performance.

H3: Venture atmosphere in industrial clusters have remarkable positive effects on both individual and organizational venture performance.

.  TEST AND ANALYSIS OF HYPOTHESIS   This paper has adopted multiple linear regression analysis  method to analyze the influences of industrial cluster venture incubation elements on venture performance. Eight elements such as venture incubation subject, incubation environments and incubation atmosphere are taken as multiple independent variables; two dimensions of venture performance are taken as dependent variables; and then all entry regression analysis method is applied to build a multiple linear regression equation of venture performance.

The analysis results are shown in Table 3 below.

TABLE  Results of Regression Analysis Individual development  performance Enterprises? operation  performance Independent variables Coefficient   T value  Coefficient   T value  Government  0.16 3.21 0.18 4.21** Consulting service 0.23 2.32** 0.24 3.10  NGO  0.21 2.24* 0.29 3.42** Education research 0.15 3.56** 0.13 2.69*  finance  0.28 2.76** 0.31 3.78** Market  0.14 3.18** 0.32 4.01**  Venture environment 0.24 3.45** 0.21 3.36** Venture atmosphere 0.29 3.61** 0.23 3.38**  Revised R2 0.29 0.34 F value 12.31** 19.54** *p<0.05  **p<0.01, coefficient 	 as standard regression coefficient  - 305 -     It can be seen from the analysis results that the NGO  subjects, education research subjects, information and finance subjects and market subjects in industrial clusters all have remarkable positive effects on both entrepreneurs? individual development performance and the related enterprises? operation performance; the government subjects have remarkable positive effects on the enterprises? operation performance, not very prominent on individual performance while consulting service subjects have remarkable positive effects on entrepreneurs? individual development performance, not very prominent on enterprises. Both of the two dimensions of industrial clusters in incubation environments and incubation atmosphere have remarkable positive effects on venture performance.

It can be concluded from the results that hypothesis H1c, H1d. H1e, H1f, H2 and H3 are completely proved while hypothesis H1a and H1b are partly proved.

. RESULTS   The results of the data analysis indicates that industrial  clusters establish the incubation system of enterprising talents through the subjects of governments, NGOs, consulting service institutions, scientific institutions, information and finance institutions and the related enterprises. These subjects not only boost the industrial clusters? development, but also provide the entrepreneurs in the industrial clusters with policies, venture supports, consulting services, technologies, labor resources, industrial & market resources and system & information resources.

Scholars like Bei Hu(2008) proposed that industrial clusters  have well effects on intellectual accumulation. The good venture environments and venture atmospheres in industrial clusters had become the motive power of enterprising talents? accumulation [15]. The sound institutional subjects in industrial clusters have become the catalysis of entrepreneurs? developments, which greatly boost the incubation of enterprising talents. The effects of incubation subjects have boosted the formation of entrepreneurs? entrepreneur intensions and have provided them with convenient incubation conditions meanwhile; as a result, these subjects eventually have boosted the entrepreneurs? success. And the endogenetic resources advantages arisen from the entrepreneurships in return have promoted the venture resources? accumulations and have pushed technological innovations and industrial upgrading forward in industrial clusters, which help to realize the sustainable development of industrial clusters and eventually constantly strengthen industrial clusters? effects on entrepreneurs? incubation (shown in the Fig. II in the end of the article).

In order to promote the incubation efficiency and effects of enterprising talents in industrial clusters, it is necessary to further strengthen governments? guidance and overall programming effects, fully develop NGOs? jointing and coordinating functions. By taking the concentrated advantage of the information and resources brought by accumulative economy in industrial clusters, it provides the entrepreneurs with convenient venture environments and good venture atmospheres, build industrial clusters? entrepreneur incubator systems, form a benign circulation and interaction of ?industrial clusters attract entrepreneurs while entrepreneurs drive industrial clusters? upgrading and developments?.
