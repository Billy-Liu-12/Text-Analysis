Triadic fuzzy Galois connections as ordinary connections

Abstract?The paper presents results on representation of the basic structures related to ternary fuzzy relations by the structures related to ordinary ternary relations, such as Galois connections, closure operators, and trilattices (structures of maximal Cartesian subrelations). These structures appear as the fundamental structures in relational data analysis such as formal concept analysis or association rules. We prove several representation theorems that allow us to automatically transfer some of the known results from the ordinary case to fuzzy case.

The transfer is demonstrated by examples.



I. INTRODUCTION Relations play a fundamental role in mathematics, computer  science, and their applications. Many results about ordinary relations have been generalized to the setting of fuzzy relations in the past. There has always been a fundamental question of how the various fuzzifications are related to the ordinary notions and results. Needless to say, this question is important both from a practical and theoretical point of view and is treated to some extent in textbooks, see e.g. [15].

In this paper we deal with basic structures associated to ternary relations that appear as fundamental ones in the methods of relational data analysis, namely the closure-like structures such as Galois connections, closure operators, struc- tures of their fixpoints and the like. Such structures appear e.g. in formal concept analysis [11], association rules [25], relational databases [19], or relational equations [10]. We focus on ternary relations and provide hints to generalize the results in a straightforward way to general n-ary relations. Note that ternary and higher order relations are becoming increasingly important for their role in the analysis of three-way and n- way data [9], [14], [16], [17]. In particular, we look at the structures associated to ordinary ternary relations and their relationships to their counterparts associated to ternary fuzzy relations. Since the very basic structures are induced by Galois connections, we focus on these and the structures of their fixpoints. Such structures appear directly in triadic concept analysis [18], [23], triadic association rules [14], or in factor analysis of triadic data [5], [7].

The most common way of looking at the relationship between ordinary notions and their fuzzy counterparts is in terms of a-cuts of fuzzy relations (see e.g. [15]) but there are additional possible views at the question as well. One of them, utilized in this paper, is provided in [3, Section 3.1.2].

Our paper is organized as follows. We first provide prelim- inaries in Section II. In Section III, we introduce the Galois  connections induced by ternary fuzzy relations and provide their axiomatization. In Section IV, we describe two kinds of representation of these Galois connections by means of Galois connections induced by ordinary relations and present an application of our results, namely a theorem showing that every fuzzy concept trilattice is isomorphic to some ordinary concept trilattice. Due to lack of space, the proofs are omited and left for the full version of this paper.



II. PRELIMINARIES  A. Fuzzy logic and fuzzy sets  This section contains preliminaries regarding the structures of truth degrees and basic notions used in fuzzy logic and fuzzy sets. More information can be found in [3], [13].

We assume that the degrees form a bounded partially ordered set L which is a complete lattice. Furthermore, we assume that L is equipped with certain aggregation operators which are known from mathematical fuzzy logic [12], [13].

In particular, we assume that the scale L of degrees forms a complete residuated lattice, i.e. an algebra  L = ?L,?,?,?,?, 0, 1?  such that ?L,?,?, 0, 1? is a complete lattice with 0 and 1 being the least and greatest element of L, respectively; ?L,?, 1? is a commutative monoid (i.e. ? is commutative, associative, and a ? 1 = a for each a ? L); ? and ? satisfy the so-called adjointness property:  a? b ? c iff a ? b? c (1)  for each a, b, c ? L. In fuzzy logic, elements a of L are called truth degrees and ? and ? are considered as the (truth functions of) many-valued conjunction and implication.

A common choice of L is a structure with L = [0, 1] (unit interval), ? and ? being minimum and maximum, ? being a continuous (or at least left-continuous) t-norm (i.e. a commutative, associative, and isotone operation on [0, 1] with 1 acting as a neutral element) with the corresponding? given by a ? b = max{c | a ? c ? b}. The three most important pairs of adjoint operations on the unit interval are: ?ukasiewicz (a? b = max(a+ b?1, 0), a? b = min(1?a+ b, 1); Go?del (a ? b = min(a, b), a ? b = 1 if a ? b, = b if a > b; Goguen (a? b = a ? b, a? b = 1 if a ? b, = b/a if a > b).

Another common choice is a finite linearly ordered L. For  U.S. Government work not protected by U.S. copyright  WCCI 2012 IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence June, 10-15, 2012 - Brisbane, Australia FUZZ IEEE    instance, one can put L = {a0 = 0, a1, . . . , an = 1} ? [0, 1] (a0 < ? ? ? < an) with ? given by ak?al = amax(k+l?n,0) and the corresponding? given by ak ? al = amin(n?k+l,n). Such an L is called a finite ?ukasiewicz chain. Another possibility is a finite Go?del chain which consists of L and restrictions of Go?del operations from [0, 1] to L. A special case of a complete residuated lattice is the two-element Boolean algebra ?{0, 1},?,?,?,?, 0, 1?, denoted by 2, which is the structure of truth degrees of classical logic. This is important because for the particular case L = 2, the notions and results become the ones regarding ordinary sets and relations.

Given a complete residuated lattice L, we define the usual notions [3], [13]: an L-set (fuzzy set, graded set) A in a universe U is a mapping A : U ? L, A(u) being interpreted as ?the degree to which u belongs to A?. Let LU denote the collection of all L-sets in U . Operations with L-sets are defined componentwise. For instance, the intersection of L-sets A,B ? LU is an L-set A ? B in U such that (A ? B)(u) = A(u) ? B(u) for each u ? U , etc. 2-sets and operations with 2-sets can be identified with ordinary sets and operations with ordinary sets, respectively. Binary L-relations (binary fuzzy relations) between X and Y can be thought of as L-sets in the universe X?Y ; similarly for ternary relations.

Given A,B ? LU , we define the degree S(A,B) of inclusion of A in B by  S(A,B) = ?  u?U ( A(u)? B(u)  ) (2)  and the degree of equality of A and B by  A ? B = ?  u?U ( A(u)? B(u)  ) (3)  Note that (2) generalizes the ordinary subsethood relation ?.

Described verbally, S(A,B) represents a degree to which every element of A is an element of B. In particular, we write A ? B iff S(A,B) = 1. As a consequence, A ? B iff A(u) ? B(u) for each u ? U . Likewise, (3) generalizes the ordinary equality relation =. A ? B represents a degree to which every element belongs to A iff it belongs to B. Clearly, A = B iff A ? B = 1.

B. Triadic concept analysis and Galois connections  In this section, we provide the basic notions regarding the structures related to ternary relations, mainly in terms of formal concept analysis which is the main intended application area of our results. More information can be found in [18], [23], see also [11].

A triadic context is a quadruple ?X,Y, Z, I? where X , Y , and Z are non-empty sets, and I is a ternary relation between X , Y , and Z, i.e. I ? X ?Y ?Z. The sets X , Y , and Z are interpreted as the sets of objects, attributes, and conditions, respectively; I is interpreted as the incidence relation (?to have-under relation?). That is, ?x, y, z? ? I is interpreted as: object x has attribute y under condition z. In this case, we say that x, y, z (or x, z, y, or the result of listing x, y, z in any other sequence) are related by I . For convenience, a triadic context is denoted by ?X1, X2, X3, I?.

Let K = ?X1, X2, X3, I? be a triadic context. For {i, j, k} = {1, 2, 3} and Ck ? Xk, consider the dyadic context [11]  KijCk = ?Xi, Xj , I ij Ck ?  defined by  ?xi, xj? ? IijCk iff for each xk ? Ck : xi, xj , xk are related by I.

The concept-forming operators induced by KijCk are denoted by (i,j,Ck). That is, for Ci ? Xi and Cj ? Xj we have  C (i,j,Ck) i = {xj ? Xj : for each xi ? Ci : ?xi, xj? ? I  ij Ck },  C (i,j,Ck) j = {xi ? Xi : for each xj ? Cj : ?xi, xj? ? I  ij Ck }.

A triadic concept of ?X1, X2, X3, I? is a triplet ?C1, C2, C3? of C1 ? X1, C2 ? X2, and C3 ? X3, such that for every {i, j, k} = {1, 2, 3} we have  Ci = C (i,j,Ck) j , Cj = C  (j,k,Ci) k , and Ck = C  (k,i,Cj) i .

Note that the latter conditions hold for every 3-element set {i, j, k} = {1, 2, 3} if and only if they hold for any single 3-element set {i, j, k} = {1, 2, 3}. C1, C2, and C3 are called the extent, intent, and modus of ?C1, C2, C3?. Geometrically, triadic concepts are just the maximal cuboids contained in I , i.e. maximal subrelations of I that result as Cartesian products of sets of objects, attributes, and modi. The set of all triadic concepts of ?X1, X2, X3, I? is denoted by T (X1, X2, X3, I) and is called the concept trilattice of ?X1, X2, X3, I?; we refer to Section IV for the notion of a trilattice. Note that complete trilattices (and n-lattices) are the appropriate generalizations of complete lattices (i.e. dyadic lattices) that result as naturally structured sets of fixpoints of the connections induced by ternary (and n-ary) relations.

For {i, j, k} = {1, 2, 3}, a triadic context ?X1, X2, X3, I? induces the operators  (i)I : 2 Xj ? 2Xk ? 2Xi  defined by  (Cj , Ck) (i)I = C  (j,i,Ck) j  for any Cj ? Xj and Ck ? Xk. The triplet ?(1)I , (2)I , (3)I ?, denoted also simply by ?(1), (2), (3)?, forms an (ordinary) triadic Galois connection [8], see also Section III. That is, for every Ci ? Xi, Cj ? Xj , and Ck ? Xk, one has  C3 ? (C1, C2)(3) iff C1 ? (C2, C3)(1)  iff C2 ? (C1, C3)(2). (4)  Conversely, every triplet ?(1)I , (2)I , (3)I ? satisfying (4) is in- duced by some triadic context [8].



III. TRIADIC FUZZY GALOIS CONNECTIONS  A. Triadic fuzzy contexts and their Galois connections  The basic notions of triadic concept analysis have been generalized for data with fuzzy attributes, i.e. for ternary fuzzy relations, in [6] and have been utilized for factor analysis of three-way data in [7]. We now recall the notions needed.

A triadic L-context (triadic fuzzy context, or just triadic context) is a quadruple ?X,Y, Z, I? where X , Y , and Z are non-empty sets, and I is a ternary fuzzy relation between X , Y , and Z, i.e. I : X ? Y ? Z ? L. Again, X , Y , and Z are interpreted as the sets of objects, attributes, and conditions, respectively, and for x ? X , y ? Y , and z ? Z, the degree I(x, y, z) ? L is interpreted as the degree to which object x has attribute y under condition z. In this case, we also say that I(x, y, z) is the degree to which x, y, z (or x, z, y or z, x, y, etc.) are related and, for convenience, denote I(x, y, z) also by I{x, y, z} or I{x, z, y} or I{z, x, y}, etc.

As in the ordinary case, we denote a triadic fuzzy context by ?X1, X2, X3, I?. Except for mathematical arguments, the motivation for considering triadic fuzzy context is that in several situations, the relationship between objects, attributes, and modi appear. For example, a degree to which object x has feature y under condition z may be interpreted as the degree to which customer z considers product x as having feature y (e.g., the degree 3/4 means that customer z considers food product x as having a good taste), see [6].

For every {i, j, k} = {1, 2, 3} and a fuzzy set Ak ? LXk , a triadic L-context K = ?X1, X2, X3, I? induces a dyadic L-context  KijAk = ?Xi, Xj , I ij Ak ?  in which the fuzzy relation IijAk between Xi and Xj is defined by  IijAk(xi, xj) = ?  xk?Xk  (Ak(xk)? I{xi, xj , xk})  for every xi ? Xi and xj ? Xj . Dyadic L-contexts and the associated structures including concept-forming operators and concept lattices were studied in a series of papers, see e.g.

[3], [4], [20]. The concept-forming operators induced by KijAk are denoted by (i,j,Ak). That is, for a fuzzy set Ai in Xi, we define a fuzzy set A(i,j,Ak)i in Xj by  A (i,j,Ak) i (xj) =  ? xi?Xi Ai(xi)? I  ij Ak  (xi, xj).

Similarly,  A (i,j,Ak) j (xi) =  ? xj?Xj Aj(xj)? I  ij Ak  (xi, xj).

A triadic L-concept (triadic fuzzy concept) of ?X1, X2, X3, I? is a triplet ?A1, A2, A3? consisting of fuzzy sets A1 ? LX1 , A2 ? LX2 , and A3 ? LX3 , such that for every {i, j, k} = {1, 2, 3} we have Ai = A(i,j,Ak)j , Aj = A  (j,k,Ai) k , and Ak = A  (k,i,Aj) i . In this case, A1, A2, and  A3 are called the extent, intent, and modus of ?A1, A2, A3?.

The set of all triadic concepts of K = ?X1, X2, X3, I? is  denoted by T (X1, X2, X3, I) and is called the L-concept trilattice (fuzzy concept trilattice) of K.

Remark 1. Clearly, the notions introduced in this section generalize the corresponding ordinary notions reviewed in Section II. Namely, putting L = {0, 1}, the notions of a triadic L-context, the induced operators and so on may be identified with the ordinary notions.

B. Axiomatizing Galois connections of triadic fuzzy contexts  As in the ordinary case, a triadic L-context ?X1, X2, X3, I? induces three operators  (i)I : L Xj ? LXk ? LXi  for {i, j, k} = {1, 2, 3} which are defined by  (Aj , Ak) (i)I = A  (j,i,Ak) j (5)  for any Aj ? LXj and Ak ? LXk . The triplet ?(1)I , (2)I , (3)I ?, denoted also just by ?(1), (2), (3)?, is axiomatized below. In fact, we provide an axiomatization of a wider class of operators for reasons that become apparent later.

Remark 2. For convenience, we use also (A2, A1)(3) with the meaning (A2, A1)(3) = (A1, A2)(3); same for (1) and (2).

Recall that an order filter in a partially ordered set ?L,?? is any subset K ? L for which a ? K and a ? b imply b ? K for any a, b ? L.

Definition 1. Let K be an order filter in ?L,??. A triadic LK-Galois connection between sets X1, X2, and X3 is a triplet ?(1), (2), (3)? of mappings (1) : LX2 ? LX3 ? LX1 , (2) : LX1 ? LX3 ? LX2 , and (3) : LX1 ? LX2 ? LX3 , satisfying for every A1 ? LX1 , A2 ? LX2 , and A3 ? LX3 , that if S(A3, (A1, A2)(3)) ? K or S(A1, (A2, A3)(1)) ? K or S(A2, (A1, A3)  (2)) ? K, then  S(A3, (A1, A2) (3)) = S(A1, (A2, A3)  (1)) =  = S(A2, (A1, A3) (2)). (6)  Remark 3. (a) One can easily see that for L = {0, 1}, triadic LK-Galois connections become ordinary triadic Galois connections (observe that in this case, there are only two filters, namely K = L and K = {1} and both lead to the same notion of an LK-Galois connection).

(b) In accordance with [1], we use the term L-Galois connections for LL-Galois connections.

The following theorem provides an alternative characteri- zation of LK-Galois connections in terms of extensivity ond antitony.

Theorem 1. For {i, j, k} = {1, 2, 3}, a triplet ?(1), (2), (3)? is a triadic LK-Galois connection iff the following conditions hold for all Ai, A?i ? LXi , Aj ? LXj , Ak ? LXk : (a) Ai ? (Aj , (Ai, Aj)(k))(i) (extensivity), (b) if S(Ai, A?i) ? K then  S(Ai, A ? i) ? S((A?i, Aj)(k), (Ai, Aj)(k)) (antitony).

Next, we provide some properties that are needed to show a bijective correspondence between ternary fuzzy relations and triadic L-Galois connections, i.e. proving that triadic L-Galois connections are represented by ternary fuzzy relations.

Lemma 1. For {i, j, k} = {1, 2, 3}, index sets P , Q, and fuzzy sets Aip ? LXi , and Ajp ? LXj the following equality holds:  ( ? p?P  Aip, ? q?Q  Ajq) (k) =  ? p?P,q?Q  (Aip, Ajq) (k) (7)  Lemma 2. Let ((1), (2), (3)) be a triadic L-Galois connection.

Then for {i, j, k} = {1, 2, 3} and Ai ? LXi let the mappings ?Ai : LXj ? LXk and ?Ai : LXk ? LXj be defined as  A ?Ai k = (Ak, Ai)  (j)  A ?Ai j = (Aj , Ai)  (k).

Then ??Ai , ?Ai? forms a dyadic L-Galois connection between Xj and Xk [1].

Lemma 3. For {i, j, k} = {1, 2, 3} it holds (a) a? ({1/xi}, {1/xj})(k) = ({a/xi}, {1/xj})(k), (b)  ? xi?XiAi(xi)? ({1/xi}, {1/xj})  (k)=(Ai, {1/xj})(k).

The next theorem, which can be proved using the above lemmas, shows that triadic L-Galois connections are just the mappings obtained from ternary fuzzy relations by (5).

Theorem 2. Let I ? LX1?X2?X3 . Let ?(1), (2), (3)? be a triadic L-Galois connection between X1, X2, and X3 and define a ternary relation I?(1),(2),(3)? ? LX1?X2?X3 by  I?(1),(2),(3)?(x1, x2, x3) = ({1/x1}, {1/x2})(3) = = ({1/x1}, {1/x3})(2) = ({1/x2}, {1/x3})(1).

Then (a) The triplet ?(1)I , (2)I , (3)I ? forms a triadic L-Galois con-  nection.

(b) I = I?(1)I ,(2)I ,(3)I ?.

(c) ?(1), (2), (3)? = ? (1)I ?(1),(2),(3)? ,  (2)I ?(1),(2),(3)? ,  (3)I ?(1),(2),(3)? ?.

Therefore, (6) provides an axiomatization of the mappings induced by ternary fuzzy relations by (5).



IV. REPRESENTATION OF TRIADIC FUZZY GALOIS CONNECTIONS BY ORDINARY CONNECTIONS  In this section, we provide two kinds of representation of triadic fuzzy Galois connections using ordinary tradic Galois connections. In Section IV-A, we present a representation which is based on looking at a fuzzy set A in U as the area below the membership function, i.e. a subset of the Cartesian product U ?L of U and the set L of truth degrees. In Section IV-B, we present another representation, a cut-like one, using which a triadic fuzzy Galois connection is represented as a nested system of ordinary triadic connections. In Section IV-C, we present an application of the Cartesian representation in showing that every fuzzy concept trilattice is isomorphic to some ordinary concept trilattice.

A. Cartesian representation  For the first type of representation, we utilize the following mappings, studied in [2] and further developed in [3] (note that these mappings were independently introduced in [20]).

For a fuzzy set A ? LU put  bAc = {?u, a? ? U ? L | a ? A(u)};  For an ordinary set B ? U ? L, define a fuzzy set dBe in U by  dBe(u) = ?  ?u,a??B  a.

bAc may be thought of as the area below A while dBe may be thought of as an upper envelope of B. In what follows, we use the properties of b c and d e which may be found in [3].

Definition 2. An (ordinary) triadic Galois connection ??1?, ?2?, ?3?? between X1 ? L, X2 ? L, X3 ? L is called commutative with respect to bdec iff  (bdAiec, bdAjec)?k? = bd(Ai, Aj)ec?k? (8)  holds for any {i, j, k} = {1, 2, 3} and any sets A1 ? X1?L, A2 ? X2 ? L, and A3 ? X3 ? L.

The following definition shows how triplets of mappings on fuzzy sets in Xis may be defined from triplets of mappings on subsets of Xi?Ls and vice versa. (By small abuse of notation we utilize (i)(i) to denote the mapping induced by (i).)  Definition 3. Let {i, j, k} = {1, 2, 3}. For a triadic Galois connection ??1?, ?2?, ?3?? between X1 ? L, X2 ? L, X3 ? L, and fuzzy sets Ai ? LXi , Aj ? LXj , and Ak ? LXk we define mappings (i)?i? : LXj ? LXk ? LXi by  (Aj , Ak) (i)?i? = d(bAjc, bAkc)(i)e (9)  Let ?(1), (2), (3)? be a triadic L-Galois connection between X1, X2, and X3. Then for sets Ai ? Xi ? L, Aj ? Xj ? L, and Ak ? Xk ? L, we define mappings ?i?(i) : (Xj ? L) ? (Xk ? L)? Xi ? L by  (Aj , Ak) ?i?(i) = b(dAje, dAke)(i)c (10)  The following theorem provides the first way to represent triadic fuzzy Galois connections using ordinary connections.

Theorem 3. Let ?(1), (2), (3)? be a triadic L{1}-Galois connec- tion between X1, X2, and X3 and ??1?, ?2?, ?3?? be a triadic Galois connection. between X1 ? L, X2 ? L, and X3 ? L.

Then the following holds: (a) ??1?(1) , ?2?(2) , ?3?(3)? is a triadic Galois connection com-  mutative with respect to bdec.

(b) ?(1)?1? , (2)?2? , (3)?3?? is a triadic L{1}-Galois connection.

(c) The map ?(1), (2), (3)? 7? ??1?, ?2?, ?3?? is an one-to-one  map between the set of all triadic L{1}-Galois connec- tions between X1, X2, and X3 and the set of all triadic Galois connections between X1 ? L, X2 ? L, X3 ? L that are commutative with respect to bdec.

B. Cut-like representation  The second representation is inspired by the notion of an a-cut of a fuzzy set. Recall that for a fuzzy set A ? LU and a degree a ? L, the a-cut aA of A is the ordinary subset of U defined by  aA = {u ? U | a ? A(u)}.

It is well known that each fuzzy set is uniquely represented by the system of its a-cuts. Depending on the properties of the scale of truth degrees, one may introduce an appropriate notion of a nested system of subsets of U in such a way that nested systems become just the system of a-cuts of fuzzy sets, see e.g. [3].

One may easily verify that straightforward conditions such as (aA1, aA2)(3) = a((A1, A2)(3)) do not hold for tradic fuzzy Galois connections. Nevertheless, a cut-like representation of triadic fuzzy Galois connections is possible, as shown in the rest of this section. The representation is based on the following notion.

Definition 4. Let {i, j, k} = {1, 2, 3}. A system {?(1a), (2a), (3a)? | a ? L} of (ordinary) triadic Galois connections is called L-nested iff  1) for each a, b ? L such that a ? b, and Ai ? LXi , Aj ? LXj it holds (Ai, Aj)(ka) ? (Ai, Aj)(kb)  2) for all xi ? Xi, xj ? Xj , xk ? Xk the set {a ? L | xi ? ({xj}, {xk})(ia)} has a greatest element.

We need the following lemmas.

Lemma 4. For {i, j, k} = {1, 2, 3}, let I ? LX1?X2?X3 be an L-relation, ?(1), (2), (3)? be the triadic L-Galois connection induced by I and for a ? L let ?(1a), (2a), (3a)? be the triadic Galois connections induced by the cuts aI . Then (a) for every Ai ? 2Xi , Aj ? 2Xj , and a ? L we have  a(Ai, Aj) (k) = (Ai, Aj)  (ka),  (b) for all fuzzy sets Ai ? LXi , Aj ? LXj , and b, c ? L we have  a(Ai, Aj) (k) =  ? b,c?L  (bAi, cAj)  (ka?b?c).

Lemma 5. Let ?(1)1 , (2)1 , (3)1? and ?(1)2 , (2)2 , (3)2? be triadic L-Galois connections, let I1 and I2 be the corresponding L-relations between X1, X2, and X3. Then for {i, j, k} = {1, 2, 3} it holds that I1 ? I2 iff for each Ai ? LXi , Aj ? LXj it holds (Ai, Aj)(k)1 ? (Ai, Aj)(k)2 .

Using the above lemmas, one may proove the following theorem which provides the cut-like representation of triadic fuzzy Galois connections.

Theorem 4. For a triadic L-Galois connection ?(1), (2), (3)? between X1, X2, and X3 denote  C?(1),(2),(3)? = {?(1a), (2a), (3a)? | a ? L}.

For an L-nested system {?(1a), (2a), (3a)? | a ? L } of triadic Galois connections between X1, X2, and X3 denote by  ?(1)C , (2)C , (3)C ? the mappings defined for {i, j, k} = {1, 2, 3}, and Ai ? LXi , Aj ? LXj by  (Ai, Aj) (k)C (xk) =  ? {a | xk ?  ? b,c?L  (bAi, cAj)  (ka?b?c)}.

Then (a) C?(1),(2),(3)? is an L-nested system of triadic Galois con-  nections, (b) ?(1)C , (2)C , (3)C ? is a triadic L-Galois connection, (c) ?(1), (2), (3)? = ?  (1)C ?(1),(2),(3)? ,  (2)C ?(1),(2),(3)? ,  (3)C ?(1),(2),(3)? ?,  and C = C?(1)C ,(2)C ,(3)C ?, i.e. the mappings between the sets of all triadic L-Galois connections and all nested systems of triadic Galois connections are mutually inverse bijections.

C. Application of the Cartesian representation  In this section we present, as an application of the previous results, a theorem saying that every fuzzy concept trilattice is isomorphic to some ordinary concept trilattice via a natural isomorphism. A particular consequence of this result is the claim that a fuzzy concept trilattice is indeed a trilattice (see below for the notion of a trilattice).

Let us recall the following notions [23]. Let V be a non-empty set, and for i ? {1, 2, 3} let .i be quasiorder relations on V . ?V,.1,.2,.3? is called a triordered set if and only if the following two conditions hold for every {i, j, k} = {1, 2, 3}:  1) v .i w and v .j w implies w .k v for every v, w ? V ; 2) ?i ? ?j ? ?k is an identity relation on V .

For triordered sets ?V,.V1 ,.V2 ,.V3 ? and ?W,.W1 ,.W2 ,.W3 ?, a mapping h : V ? W is called an isomorphism if it is bijective and satisfies v1 .Vi v2 iff h(v)1 .

W i h(v2) for every  v1, v2 ? V and every i ? {1, 2, 3}.

Let Vi, Vk ? V . An element v ? V is called an ik-bound  of ?Vi, Vk? if vi .i v and vk .k v for every vi ? Vi and vk ? Vk. An ik-bound v is called an ik-limit of ?Vi, Vk? if u .j v for every ik-bound u of ?Vi, Vk?. In every triordered set (V,.1,.2,.3) there is at most one ik-limit v of ?Vi, Vk? satisfying v .k u for every ik-limit u of ?Vi, Vk?. If such v exists, we call v an ik-join of ?Vi, Vk? and denote it by ?ik(Vi, Vk). A triordered set (V,.1,.2,.3) in which the ik- join exists for all i 6= k (i, k ? {1, 2, 3}) and all pairs ?Vi, Vk? of subsets of V is called a complete trilattice.

It is easy to see that the set of all triadic concepts of a triadic LK-Galois connection forms a triordered set w.r.t. inclusions ? of fuzzy sets as the quasiorders. We utilize the facts that the set of all triadic concepts of an ordinary triadic Galois connection ?(1), (2), (3)? forms a trilattice, denoted here by T (X1, X2, X3, ?(1), (2), (3)?).

Lemma 6. For a triadic LK-Galois connection ?(1), (2), (3)? the triordered sets T (X1, X2, X3, ?(1), (2), (3)?) and T (X1 ? L,X2?L,X3?L, ??1?(1) , ?2?(2) , ?3?(3)?) are isomorphic. More- over, T (X1 ? L,X2 ? L,X3 ? L, ??1?(1) , ?2?(2) , ?3?(3)?) =    T (X1 ? L,X2 ? L,X3 ? L, I?), where  ?(x1, a), (x2, b), (x3, c)? ? I? iff c ? ({a/x1}, {b/x2})(3).

The following theorem, which can be proven by the previous lemma, shows an important fact that every fuzzy concept trilattice is isomorphic to a certain concept trilattice.

Theorem 5. Any L-concept trilattice T (X1, X2, X3, I) is isomorphic as a triordered set to the (ordinary) concept trilattice T (X1 ? L,X2 ? L,X3 ? L, I?), where  ?(x1, a), (x2, b), (x3, c)? ? I? iff a? b? c ? I(x1, x2, x3).

As a consequence, it follows that every fuzzy concept trilattice is indeed a trilattice in the sense defined above.

Moreover, one may use the above results to obtain a short proof of the basic theorem of fuzzy concept trilattices [6] by reduction to the basic theorem of ordinary concept trilattices [23]. This result is left for the extended version of this paper.



V. CONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER ISSUES  We provided an axiomatic characterization of triadic fuzzy Galois connections and two ways to represent them by or- dinary tradic connections. These connections appear in data analysis of three-way relational data. Most importantly, the fixpoints of these mappings are maximal cuboids contained in the data (maximal Cartesian subrelations of the relation representing the data).

The results establish important connections between the ordinary and the fuzzy case that enable us to easily carry over results (theorems, algorithms) for triadic fuzzy data from those for ordinary triadic data. As an example, we presented a theo- rem showing that every fuzzy concept trilattice is isomorphic, via a natural isomorphism, to some ordinary concept trilattice.

The following topics are left for future research: ? Identify, formally if possible, the types of results that may  be automatically carried over from the ordinary case to fuzzy case.

? Develop other possible types of reduction. Extend the applicability of the presented representation to a wider class of relational methods (see [3] for a general cut-like semantics for predicate fuzzy logic).

? Study the computational efficiency of the representation results with the aim of obtaining algorithms for fuzzy relations from those for ordinary relations.
