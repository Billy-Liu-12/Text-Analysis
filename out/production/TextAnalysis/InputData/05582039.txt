Large-scale Wireless Sensor Networks Situation Awareness Using

Abstract-Situation awareness has lately become an important topic of wireless sensor networks research. In this paper, multi? variate time series association rules mining method is applied to large-scale wireless sensor network data to comprehend situation.

With this method, the patterns of sensor network behavior are able to be obtained. In order to verify the above proposal, experiments are conducted and, together with application of Intel Berkeley research lab data, show some positive results.

r. INTRODUCTION  E NDSLEY has formally defined Situation Awareness (SA)  as the "perception of the elements in the environment within a volume of time and space, the comprehension of their meaning and the projection of their status in the near future".

This definition breaks the concept of Cyberspace Situation Awareness (CSA) into three distinct levels: perception of the cyberspace environment, comprehension of the meaning of cyberspace situation information, and projection or prediction of events or actions in the future based on this perception and comprehension [2], [3], [4].

Large-scale wireless sensor network is highly dynamic, which exhibits multi-timescale properties (temporal domain).

How to perceive the situation of large-scale wireless sensor network is a difficult issue. The contribution of this work is that multiple attributes from distributed sensors are viewed as multivariate time series and patterns of these attributes are obtained with multivariate time series association rules.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, multivariate time series association rules mining is discussed in detail. In Section III, the experiment with real data is given and a conclusion in Section IV.



II. MULTIVARIATE TIME SERIES ASSOCIATION RULES MINING  A. Symbolic Representation of Time Series  The basic idea of P iecewise Aggregate Approximation (PAA) [5], [6] is that it represents the time series as a sequence of rectangle basis functions. It is a dimensionality-reduction representation method in essential as in Eq.(1):  N :ij.

i  pi=- L Pi n i=:ij.(i-l)+l (1)  n is the length of sequence, N is the number of PAA segments. Pi is the average value of the /h segment.

The basic idea of Symbolic Aggregate approximation (SAX) [5], [6] is that it converts the time series into an discrete  ? High  Awarenes level  Low  s  ?

symbolic sequence. Having transformed a time series data into the PAA, we can apply SAX to obtain a discrete symbolic representation. Since normalized time series have a Gaussian distribution, we can determine the breakpoints that will pro? duce c equal-sized areas under Gaussian distribution curve [7].

Breakpoints are a sorted list of numbers B = /31, f32, ... , /3c-l , such that the area under a N(O, 1) Gaussian distribution curving from /3i to /3i+l = ?( /30 and /3c are defined as -00 and 00, respectively).

B. Multivariate Time Series Association Rules Mining  1) Apriori Algorithm: 1 = {iI, i2, ... ,id is a set of items.

X is an itemset if it is a subset of I. T = {ti,ti+l, ... ,tn} is a set of transaction. A transaction t contains itemset X iff, for all items, where i EX, i is a t - itemset. All item set X in a transaction database has a support, denoted Sup(X), see as in Eq.(2).

Sup (X) = a(X)  ITI (2)  where a(X) = 1{/; lX ? ti,ti E T}1.Given an itemset X, we find all the rules X -+ Y with minimum support and corifidence. Support is a probability that a transaction contains , denoted as Sup(X U Y).Corifidence is a conditional proba? bility that a transaction contains X as well as Y, denoted as Sup (X U Y) / Sup (X) . Frequent Itemsets is used to generate all frequent item sets in a given database T .

Generally, an association rules mining algorithm contains the following steps: The set of candidate k - itemsets is     generated by I-extensions of the large (k - 1) - itemsets generated in the previous iteration. Supports for the candidate k - it emsets are generated by a pass over the database. It emsets that do not have the minimum support are discarded and the remaining item sets are called large k - itemsets. This process is repeated until no more large itemsets are found. Apriori is more efficient during the candidate generation process. Apriori uses pruning techniques to avoid measuring certain itemsets, while guaranteeing completeness. These are the itemsets that the algorithm can prove will not tum out to be large. However there are two bottlenecks of the Apriori algorithm. One is the complex candidate generation process that uses most of the time, space and memory. Another bottleneck is the multiple scan of the database.

2) Multivariate Time Series Association Rules Mining: Unlike general association rules mining, the time of data point should be focused on when we using multivariate time series association rules mining. Each feature elements have different value at each time, so we apply association rule mining to different values of different network feature within the same time interval. We can regard the change of different proportion value with time as a multivariate time series. It is necessary for us to find out the frequent pattern of such multivariate time series. The anomalous changes which are resulted from one time series may affect the changes of other time series simultaneously. This rule lays the foundation for us to analyze the complex network behavior. Multivariate time series association rules mining (MTSARM) algorithm is shown in Algorithm 1.

III. EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION  A. Data Sets  In this simulation, the real datasets are collected from 54 sensors deployed in the Intel Berkeley Research lab [1] be? tween February 28th and March 7th, 2004. Mica2Dot sensors with weather boards collected timestamped topology infor? mation, along with humidity, temperature, light and voltage values once every 31 seconds. Data was collected using the TinyDB in-network query processing system, built on the TinyOS platform. The sensors were arranged in the lab according to the diagram shown in Figure 2.

B. Experimental Evaluation  PAA and SAX are applied to four time series of real value (temperature, humidity, light and voltage) to obtain sym? bolic series. Let S(temperature)=I, S(humidity)=2, S(light)=3,  Fig. 2. The Sensors Arrangement Diagram  S(voltage)=4, 'A' to 'D ' denotes value that change from low to high.

We define minimum support as 0.05 (1660 instances) and minimum confidence as 0.9, and we apply association rules mining to alphabet sequence to get association rules of the feature pattern in the Intel Berkeley Research lab data. Gen? erated sets of frequent itemsets: Size of set of large item sets L(1): 14 Size of set of large item sets L(2): 20 Size of set of large item sets L(3): 6 The best rules is shown as follows: IB,2D ==} 3B,supp = 2234,conj = 92%  The string "IB" in rule IB,2D ==} 3B(supp = 2234,conj = 92%) means that the temperature value is not high. "2D" means that the humidity value is high. "3B" means that the light value is not high. If this rule appears, then certain be? havior occurs. Different rules are mined for different behavior type. With this rule obtained above, we may comprehend current wireless sensor networks behavior.



IV. CONCLUSION  In this paper, we analyze security situation of multiple sensors using multivariate time series association rules mining algorithm. From experimental results, we can arrive at the conclusion that our method can be used to analyze large? scale wireless sensor network situation. However we should be aware that there are still some problems demanding prompt solution in the field such as the efficiency and precision problem.
