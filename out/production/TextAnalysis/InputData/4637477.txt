Research on improved Data-Mining Algorithm based on Strong Correlation

Abstract  The extensive application of association rules in commerce enables itself to be one of the most active research directions in data mining. Recently, the mining of strong correlation item pairs with statistical significance in transaction database receives a certain value. In order to further reduce the cost of testing candidate item pairs in relational database, we have developed the Taper algorithm according to 1NF property. The developed TaperR algorithm  can  cut the number of candidate pairs to improve effciency.

1. Introduction  Because lots of business data are stored in relational database, most data mining applications aim at relational database. Therefore there are extremely important theoretical value and practical significance for the research on the strong correlation item pairs in relational database. With the statistical association substituting traditional association rules, this paper focuses on the mining of strong correlation item pairs whose relevance is measured through Pearson correlation coefficient in relational database.

2. Pearson correlation coefficient and The Taper algorithm  The relevance measurement describes the connection between variables based on statistic analysis. For discrete variables, the correlation between variables can be represented with Pearson correlation coefficient.   is a special form of Pearson correlation coefficient when variables are dual. Assume there are two dual variables A and B, when their values are as table 1:  Then   can be calculated according to formula 1: ( 0 0 ) (1 1 ) ( 0 1 ) (1 0 )  ( 0 ) (1 ) ( 0 ) ( 1 )  * * ...(1)  * * *  P P P P  P P P P ?  ? ? ? ?  ? ?  Table.1 the variables vaiue  In the formula, P(ij) represents the number of objects simultaneously satisfying A=i and B=j (i=0,1; j=0, l). In addition, P(i+) represents the number of objects satisfying A=i (no need to consider B ), and P(+j) B=j (no need to  consider A ). The ?  upper bound of item pairs {A, B} can be expressed as:  ( , )  sup( ) 1 sup( ) ( ) * ....(2)  sup( ) 1 sup( )A B B A  upper A B  ? ?? ?  From formula 2, we can know that in the Taper algorithm this upper boundary is used to filter out those item pairs which are impossible to satisfy the condition, and thus we can avoid calculating these pruned item pairs and increase the efficiency.

3. The normalization theory for relational database  The relational database is one common database structure. Assume R is a relational schema, X, Y  R, if and for any two tuples u, v  r , as long as u [ X ] =v [ X ] then we can inevitably get u [ Y ] =v [ Y ], then X -> Y is said to be a functional dependency in R, that is X function determines Y or Y function depends on X. Through the functional dependency concept, different normal forms can be defined, including 2NF, 3NF as well as BCNF. As we all know, the most important normal form which each relation must meet is 1NF. Its definition is if some domain unit cannot be divided again, then this domain is atomic.

If there is a relational schema R whose all attribute fields are atomic, then R belongs to the first normal form (1NF).

B 0 1  sum  0 P(00) P(00) P(00)A 1 P(00) P(00) P(00)  sum P(00) P(00) N   DOI 10.1109/WGEC.2008.119     The important application of 1NF in association mining is: the two items of one item pair are impossible to come from the same attribute. Thereupon, through the character, we can reduce the number of the candidate item pairs in the mining and increase the efficiency.

4. The mining algorithm of strong correlation item pairs based on 1NF The TaperR algorithm  In order to further reduce the cost of testing candidate item pairs in relational database, in the paper, according to 1NF we improved the Taper algorithm and designed the TaperR algorithm Thus we can reduce the number of the candidate item pairs and thus increase the algorithm efficiency. The process of the TaperR algorithm includes two steps: the production of candidate item pairs and the pruning.

When producing the candidate item pairs, reduce the number of the candidate item pairs through 1NF. When pruning, use the upper boundary to filter out those item pairs which are impossible to meet the conditions, and thus we can avoid calculating these pruned item pairs.

First through theorem 1 to theorem 4 and so on, the superiority of the TaperR algorithm is showed.

Theorem 1:  The original Taper algorithm produces candidate item pairs before the pruning.

From Theorem 1, we can know the Taper algorithm does not consider the particularity of the relational tables so that produces all possible combinations.

Theorem 2: The TaperR algorithm produces  candidate item pairs before the pruning.

Obviously, in the first step (production of candidate item pairs), the TaperR algorithm produces  less incorrect item pairs than Taper algorithm does in relational database. Its size depends on the number of Pi with different attribute value in attribute Ai. When the relational data table contains many attributes with quite many attribute values, the superiority of the TaperR algorithm is more obvious.

In addition, the incorrect item pairs in relational database can not certainly be reduced when using the upper boundary of correlation coefficient to prune.

Therefore the computation is further increased.

Theorem 3: R1( ) and R2( ) respectively represent the number of the items not pruned with the Taper algorithm and the TaperR algorithm (given the smallest correlation threshold  ). R3 ( ) represents   item pairs which are not pruned in incorrect ones in relational database. Then we get R1( )= R2( )+R3( ).

The theorem 3 shows that the Taper algorithm not only inspects  redundant item pairs when pruning, but also checks R3 ( ) more item pairs when scanning. Therefore, through 1NF, the TaperR algorithm at least can reduce the  computation in the pruning and scanning, which counts for much when mining large-scale data.

The TaperR algorithm uses   to prune, which can filter out the item pairs impossible to meet the conditions and thus avoid calculating the support of those pruned item pairs, and then enhances the efficiency. However, from the formula, it is not difficult to find that the upper boundary always is bigger than 0.Therefore, if the smallest correlation threshold   is set to be extremely small, for instance 0.01, the pruned candidate item pairs can be extremely few, causing the pruning based on the upper boundary to be badly effective. In the paper, we take advantage of the special structure of relational table to further reduce the candidate item pairs. Its basic thought may be described as follows:  Supposing attribute value set of attribute Ai and Aj respectively are Vi={u1,u2,?,up} and V j={v1, v2, ..., vq}. These two attributes can produce p*q item pairs.

However, not all these p*q item pairs are necessary, because sup (uk) = sup (uk v1)+ sup (uk v2)+...+ sup (uk vq). Namely, sup (uk vq) = sup (uk)-sup (uk v1)-sup (uk v2) -...-sup (uk,vq-1). In other words, sup (uk vq) can be derived from sup (uk), sup (uk v1), sup (uk v2),... sup (uk vq-1). Further, there is no need to directly calculate the support of the item pairs contained vq when scanning the database. Therefore, only (p-1)*(q-1) item pairs need calculating in the scanning.

Theorem 4:   With the TaperR algorithm, at most there are  1 1  1 1 1  ( )*( 1) *( 1  ( ( )) ( 2 2  m m  i i m m m i i i i  i j i i j i  p p p p  p p? ? ? ? ? ?  ? ?  1)? ? ? ? ?  ? ?? ? Item pairs needing inspecting the support when  scanning the database without the pruning.

As theorem 4 shows, if the pruning effect based on  upper boundary entirely is not good enough, the number of item pairs can still be effectively reduced. The TaperR algorithm still can mine item pairs highly effective, even when the smallest correlation threshold is very small.

Therefore, summarizing the front discussion, the overall flow of the TaperR algorithm can be described as fig. 1  Fig. 1   the flow of the TaperR algorithm.

Step 1, with the TaperR algorithm, use the special structure of relational database to produce all candidate  The TaperR Algorithm  (1)  the production of Candidate item pairs      Produce all candidate item pairs conforming to 1NF (2)  the pruning of the candidate item pairs      use the upper boundary to prune (3)  database scanning scan the database for the final computation outcome     item pairs according with 1NF, guaranteeing that there are no item pairs without significance in relational database.

Step 2, in step 1, we have gained the supports of all single items .Now we can use   to prune, and thus filter out those item pairs impossible to meet the conditions and avoid scanning the database and calculating the supports of those pruned item pairs, and thus enhance the efficiency.

Step 3, scan the database. When scanning each record, examine whether each item pairs in the candidate item pairs set is in the record and the support will increase by 1 when it is true. We can gain the support of each item pairs after scanning the database.

Use  to calculate correlation coefficient of each item pairs, and then output those item pairs whose correlation coefficient is bigger than the smallest correlation threshold.

5. The experimental results  Here are the test results in real data set with the TaperR algorithm, including the comparison in the execution time and the number of item pairs between the two algorithms.

The effectiveness and the superiority of the TaperR algorithm are proved with the experimental results in 2 data sets. The Taper algorithm and the TaperR are programmed in Java. Also, all experimental results are gained after testing on a PC Computer running Windows 2000 Professional and with Pentium4-2.4G, 512 M memory. In the experiment, we use two data sets of the famous UCI data: mushroom data set and soybean data set.

Fig.2 and fig.3 separately showed the comparison in the number of item pairs needing inspection with the Taper algorithm and the TaperR algorithm in the mushroom the data set and the soybean data set, along with the smallest correlation threshold increasing. Just as what was proved theoretically above, the Taper algorithm always needs to inspect more item pairs than the TaperR algorithm does, and the superiority was confirmed again with experiments.

Fig.4 and fig.5 separately showed the comparison in the execution time (the unit is second) of the Taper algorithm and the TaperR algorithm in the mushroom data set and the soybean data set, along with the smallest correlation threshold increasing. We can see that two algorithms execution time reduces, along with the smallest correlation threshold value increasing. Meanwhile, because the Taper algorithm always needs inspecting more item pairs than the TaperR algorithm, the new algorithm has the shorter execution time.

From the result, the new algorithm has good effect in mining strong correlation item pairs in relational database and is more suitable to apply in the practical relational database system.

6. Summary and the innovative points     In this paper, we substituted the association with traditional association rules and mainly researched on the mining of strong correlation item pairs whose relevance is measured with Pearson correlation coefficient, and have designed one highly effective algorithm. Both the theoretical analysis and the experimental results indicated that--the newly proposed TaperR algorithm has good effect in mining strong correlation item pairs in relational database and also its various aspects surpass the Taper algorithm.
