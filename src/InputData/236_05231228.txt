Using Fuzzy Expert System Based on Genetic Algorithms for Intrusion Detection  System

ABSTRACT: Fuzzy logic based methods together with the techniques from Artificial Intelligence have gained importance.

Association rules together with fuzzy logic to model the fuzzy association rules are being used for classifying data. These together with the techniques of genetic algorithms like genetic programming are producing better results .Therefore, in this article, we firstly analyze the current situation of Intrusion Detection Systems, then raise a genetics-based fuzzy system algorithm. In the first stage of this algorithm, it draws initial rules out by using fuzzy algorithm, and in the second stage, the membership function is optimized by the genetic algorithm, with simplification of fuzzy rules, to build a high performance fuzzy system. Finally, we apply this algorithm to the Intrusion Detection System and get a better performance.

I.  INTRODUCTION As network-based computer systems play increasingly  vital roles in modern society, they have become the targets of hacker and virus. Therefore, we need to find the best ways possible to protect our systems [1].

The security of a computer system is compromised when an intrusion takes place. An intrusion can be defined when any set of actions that attempt to compromise the integrity, confidentiality or availability of a resource. Fortunately, some intrusion prevention techniques as a first line of defense, such as user authentication (e.g. using passwords or biometrics), avoiding programming errors, and information protection (e.g. encryption) have been applied to protect computer systems. However, intrusion prevention alone is not sufficient because as systems are becoming even more complex, there are always exploitable weakness in the systems due to design and programming errors, or various ?socially engineered? penetration techniques. For example, after it was first reported many years ago, exploitable ?buffer overflow? still exists in some recent system software due to programming errors [2]. The policies that balance convenience versus strict control of a system and information access also make it impossible for an operational system to be completely secure.

Fuzzy logic addresses the formal principles of approximate reasoning.  It provides a sound foundation to handle imprecision and vagueness as well as mature inference mechanisms by varying degrees of truth. As boundaries are not always clearly defined, fuzzy logic can be used to identify complex pattern or behavior variations [3].

And it can be accomplished by building an intrusion  detection system that combines fuzzy logic rules with an expert system in charge of evaluating rule truthfulness.

Genetic Algorithms (GA) are used to tune the fuzzy membership functions to improve the performance and select the set of features available from the audit data that provide the most information to fuzzy expert system [4]. These algorithms are often used for optimization problems.

When using fuzzy logic, it is often difficult for an expert to provide ?good? definitions for the membership functions for the fuzzy variables. Those genetic algorithms can be successfully used to tune the membership functions of fuzzy sets used by the intrusion detection system. Each fuzzy membership function can be defined using the standard function representation of fuzzy sets discussed in earlier chapters. Each chromosome for the GA consists of a sequence of these parameters [5]. An initial population of chromosomes is generated randomly where each chromosome represents a possible solution to the problem.



II. FUZZY EXPERT SYSTEM The problem of Intrusion Detection can be vest in to a  problem of classification whose goal is to classify those system actions by the action model of system to two types, normal or abnormal. Those matching the known models of attack are classified to abnormal while those matching the known model of normal actions are classified to normal.

Figure 1.  Fuzzy Expert System.

Generally speaking, the basic structure of fuzzy expert system can be shown as Figure 1,and the main features are as follows: Fuzzification Interface, Fuzzy Rule Base, Fuzzy Inference Engine and Defuzzification Interface[6][7].

A. Fuzzification Interface Fuzzification Interface is to directly transfer input value  x, according to corresponding membership function of linguistic variables, to fuzzy linguistic value ?(x).

As known to all, it will lead to a low recognition rate when the fuzzy division is too coarse while it will lead to a situation of too many fuzzy rules when it is too fine. Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) is a soft fuzzy division. It firstly divides all the variables into 3 types of high, medium and low, then finds the central point of the division, after that, sets the overlap degree of these 3 types to 30% and calculates the argument value of each membership function based on the distance between the central point and an arbitrarily one.

And this paper uses Trapezoidal membership function, as shown in Figure 2 whose values of arguments are a, b, c and d.

Figure 2.  Trapezoidal membership function.

Input the arguments of the resulting membership function, that is, the values used to fuzzificate the data set into the variable queue,  i.e., compute the rate presents how each argument fit into the fuzzy sets of high, medium, and low.

Figure 3.   TCP linguistic.

The Figure 3 illustrates the use of fuzzy sets to describe a linguistic variable TCP with domain {0-1} using the terms Low, Medium and High as specified by their respective membership functions. Fuzzy membership functions determine degrees of membership for each category of term.

In Figure 3, a TCP value of 0.3 belongs 40% to the low category and 60% to the Medium and a TCP value of 0.6 belongs 100% to Medium and 25% to High [5].

B. Fuzzy Rule Base Fuzzy rule base is one of the core compounds of the  fuzzy expert system, in which stores the conditional-control rules built by Linguistic Variables. These rules are presented in if-then forms, the part of if is a premise, this is used to judge whether the input linguistic variables will bring the rule into existence. Then the part becomes the result, which output the status those Linguistic Variables when the premise stands.

C. Fuzzy Inference Engine Fuzzy Inference Engine is on duty for fuzzy reasoning  computation, which is also a core compound, and its development is based on the concept of Approximate Reasoning. Besides, not only can it deal with the correct propositions, but also can deal with fuzzy ones. Thus, in comparison of traditional reasoning, Approximate Reasoning is more reasonable and flexible.

This paper uses Mamdani?s minimum fuzzy implication rule, the process of reasoning is shown as Figure 4.

Figure 4.  An example of reasoning of Mamdani?s minimum fuzzy implication rule.

D. Defuzzification Interface Defuzzification Interface will translate the fuzzy  information reasoned by fuzzy Inference Engine into outer acceptable values, in order to help deal with. To the system, that one must be a definite value to make effort on the judging system, but reasoning results from the fuzzy Inference Engine are fuzzy values which correspond to outputting Linguistic Variables, so, they must be put through a process of Defuzzification, make the fuzzy values to be definite, and finally can control the controlled system. The strategy of Defuzzification can be various, in this paper, we use Weighted Average Method. Weighted Average Method takes the starting intensity as weight, multiplies the sum of output of the rule, and then divides it by weight.



III. GENETIC FUZZY EXPERT SYSTEM (GFES)  A. Introduction of Genetic Algorithm Genetic Algorithm starts from presenting a population  where the problem could settle in; a population is grouped by certain number of gene-encoded individuals. In fact, each individual is an entity whose chromosome has its own feature. At the very beginning, the implementation of     mapping phenotype to genotype (i.e. encoding) is needed, and it usually can be simplified by binary encoding. After the generation of the first species group, according to the theory of survival of the fittest, from generation to generation, evolve to better approximate solutions. In each generation, individuals are selected by the fitness in the domain of problems, and are crossed over/mutated with the help of genetic operators from natural genetics, generating new groups which represent the solution set. This process can produce a group that is much fitter than the previous group to the environment. After decoding, the optimum individuals of the last generation can be used as the approximate optimum solution to the problem.

B. The Application of Genetic Algorithm Before extracting the fuzzy rules, we firstly need Fuzzy  C-Means Algorithm to compute the central point of the input variables, then roughly set the membership functions for every fuzzy sets based on the rate of intersection of the user- specific sets. What we got at this time is not a optimized group of membership arguments of fuzzy sets, so it must be optimized with GA.

The main goal of GA is to optimize fuzzy membership functions as well as simplify the fuzzy rules, so the contents of the chromosome encoding is equal to fuzzy rules encoding values and fuzzy sets arguments and all variables in the data set. The operation details are listed below?  1) Set the chromosome encoding of initial group The setting of the chromosome encoding of initial  group takes the values of arguments of fuzzy sets which is the result of Fuzzy C-Means division in the first stage. As the initial values, arbitrarily chromosome can be presented as:  s1 s2 s3 ?s48 s49?sn                                    (1) In the encoding, from s1 to s48, i.e. the first part  represents all the setting values of arguments of the input linguistic variables? membership functions; from s49 to sn, i.e., the second part represents all the rule encoding. Here, n stands for total length [8].

In this paper, we use Trapezoidal type membership function, each fuzzy set needs arguments of [a, b, c, d].

2) Generation-to-generation evolvement by using genetic rules  Select GFES model?s mating operators adopts the method of ?Simple Arithmetical Crossover?, generating new child generation by single-point mating; and adopting the ?Simple Mutation? as mutation operators, using random number single-point to make the mutation of weight value also the selection of rules.

Because the operators GEFS takes are all limiting operators, in order to make reasonable rules, all the conditions listed below have to be satisfied:  A. the value of chromosome gene must be in the interval of [0, 1];  B. the arguments of fuzzy set functions, which are in the same group, must meet the condition of a ? b ? c ? d, if disobey the limitation in evolvement, the arguments must switch places to match the order of the membership function;  C. two nearby fuzzy sets of the same linguistic item needs to match the condition of aR ? dL, R stands for the set on the right item, and L stands for the left one, if disorder, then aR and dL must change place to avoid breaking of the fuzzy interval.

C. Optimization GFES model uses roulette wheel to select among  functions, in an N-sized space of chromosome groups, the reborn probability of arbitrarily individual, Pi, can be defined as     i i N  i  i  FP F  =  = ?  (2)  In this formula, Fi  stands for the system fitness function of the individual, the formula (2) shows its estimation method, the goal is mainly to evaluate when under control of ac certain level argument(?), whether RC and NFR of the fuzzy expert system can approach the expecting combination of optimized efficient and the simplify rules[9][10].

( )  C i  FR  RF N ?  =                                               (3)  Applying genetic algorithm under the setting as described above, adjusting the arguments of the membership functions and simplifying the fuzzy rules, one can get fuzzy knowledge base of approximate optimum solutions and rules base.



IV. EXPERIMENTS AND EMULATIONS In this section, computer simulations using TCP packets  are analyzed to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. In verification experiments of intrusion, the number of records in the data set of training, testing and verification are 999, 500 and 500. The important variables which are cramped out from TCP packets are shown as Table I.

TABLE I.  TCP PACKETS VARIABLES TAKEN  No Variable Name No Variable Name 1 Duration 8 Urgent 2 Protocol Type 9 Num_failed _logins 3 Service 10 Logged_ in 4 Flag 11 Num_root 5 Src_bytes 12 Is_host_login 6 Dst_bytes 13 Is-guest _login 7 Wrong fragment 14 Root_shell   In the experiment, the parameters of GA are: the  population size = 80, the mutation rate = 0.05, the crossover rate = 0.6, the selection rate = 0.01 the stopping condition = 500 generations. The total length of chromosome is 213 bits; the genes are encoded using real number encoding.

Figure 5 shows the evolvement history of GFES. In the figure we can see the evolving process of GA goes through about 200 generations then it converges to the status of best effort, what?s more, this experiment?s selection of optimum solutions is one group that has the highest percentage of accuracy both in training and verifying classification.

Table II shows the experiment results, it shows: at the first stage, totally 93 rules had been drawn off from the process, after simplified by GA rules, only 8 rules need to be reserved, and this can maintain a 81.67%~85.42% rate of correctness.

TABLE II.  VERIFICATION RESULTS  the number of rules we got  first stage final result  93 8  correctness of classification(avg.)  training data test data verification data  81.67% 85.42% 83.83%

V. CONCLUSION In this paper, our goal is using genetic fuzzy expert  system to design a whole new way of membership function encoding in order to let the membership functions of fuzzy expert system be more flexible, and make the fuzzy division more precision. From the results of experiment, we can confirm that through using GFES-designed fuzzy expert system, we need less fuzzy rules to achieve a certain high rate of recognition even classification. Also, the generation of fuzzy rules does not need any luminous knowledge.
