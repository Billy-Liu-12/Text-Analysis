TRUST MANAGEMENT MODEL IN DISTRIBUTE GIS

ABSTRACT  Distributed computing can distribute the heavy computing task, so that the load of the server is relieved. This property of the technique solves the big problem of in managing mass data in GIS. The safety management pattern in the model of distributed computing is different from the one of centralized computing. In distributed system, every node on the web is the same. They don?t know each other. If users want to access some data in a node, there is no one to authenticate them. This article introduces an up to date production of trust management based on studying in this area to solve this problem.

INTRODUCTION  The development of Internet/Intranet and Web technique start the era of web which centralized with distributed computing. This brings opportunities and challenges to the research and application of GIS technique. On the one hand, GIS needs combining with Internet to provide web map service; on the other hand, GIS construction, data framework, software and application patterns need to be refactored to develop distributed GIS in Internet.

Distributed GIS is a kind of geographic information system theoretical computing model in web environment, which is built on distributed computing and web technique.

It is foundation of NSII (National Spatial Information Infrastructure), GSDI (Global Spatial Data Infrastructure) and DE (Digital Earth). It supports these systems. The main object of building distributed GIS is that 1) providing the ability of distributed transaction; 2) operating data among different system transparently; 3) connecting applications in different platform and isomerous networks; 4) getting better mutual operation ability on data collection between computer and human beings. Distributed GIS can make the furthest share. Distributed GIS has those basic functions: data operation, geographic survey and analysis, spatial analysis, spatial decision-making support, visualization and etc.

In the GIS application, there is a lot of spatial data which is related with secret. Being different from traditional GIS, distributed GIS has open framework. It lacks uniform specific server for authorization and accessing control. The  system safety in distributed GIS is a key problem. So, distributed GIS need a stricter and more effective safety mechanism. This article introduces trust management model to distributed GIS, and according to characters of GIS brings forward a trust management model which is more compatible with the distributed GIS environment.

2. DISTRIBUTED GIS MODEL  From distributed GIS development beginning to today, many experts or organization setup many distributed GIS model. This article research the typical distributed GIS five layers model.

2.1. The hiberarchy of model  Distributed GIS five layers model includes: application layer, expression layer, service layer, exchange layer and data layer. Every layer accords with corresponding standard. An actual GIS (a node in distributed GIS) may include one of five layers or more.

In the application layer, there are various specific applications. Users gain information directly through this layer. The expression layer encapsulates the differences between application layer and service layer by Spatial Describe Language (SDL). The service layer provides various spatial data specific service for other layers. The exchange layer supports data sharing, mutual operation and autonomy among every database through centralizing management of metadata information of those isomerous spatial databases. The exchange layer predigests the conflict of construction and semantics among the isomerous spatial database patterns. It can help users position, evaluate, compare, gain and use spatial data effectively. The data Layer express, store, operate and manage spatial data. It provides extended SQL API and spatial metadata Interface for other layers.

This model takes Internet as a computing center. It connects various server and make them work together to complete computing. Users send the computing request through Client which is connected with Internet.

2.2. The relationship of layers  In distributed GIS five layers model, various geographic data is on thousands of Internet nodes. It forms a layers-nested, unlimited-extended, complex geographic     information grid. To make a intuitionistic discussion, a predigested model is considered. This model contains only one node which consists of all five layers. In the model, there are many users, and every user can access many applications. Every application connected with many users.

All the applications connected with a SDL Server. The SDL Server can connect with many Specific Service Servers. All the Specific Service Servers connect with a Spatial Metadata Database Management System (SMDBMS) Server. The SMDBMS Server connected with many Distribute Spatial Data Engine (SDE) Servers. The Distributed SDE Server manages various geographic data in different format. In this model, the request of users and services of all layers can be executed orderly or spanning layers.

The normal workflow of users is like this: 1) send requests to application layer through Client; 2) application layer connect with expression layer or upper layer; 3) process application request in corresponding layer; 4) Integrate the results and return them to previous layer or lower layer; 5) users receive the result and show them in Client.

3. TRUST MANAGEMENT MODEL  3.1. Objective trust  Currently, trust management research includes two types of trust relationship. The one is trust of object.

Object is entity which eliminates subjective factor of human beings. Because the relationship between objects can  be validated by providing proper evidence, the objective trust is based on evidence and it can be described, ratiocinate and validated precisely  3.2. Subjective trust  The other one of trust relationship is subjective trust between entities.

Entity is individual or colony which consist of human or agent delegated for human. Subjective trust is a cognitive phenomenon of human beings. It is subjective judgment which belongs to a given grade to characters or behaviors of entities.

Subjective trust has these attributes:  Attribute 1 related with environment context;  Attribute 2 many points of view: Even in the same  context, the trust is different as node provide service in different point of view;  Attribute 3 dynamic: trust is time decay; Attribute 4 lag in time: trust is formed by learning and  experience accumulation; Attribute 5 related with domain: trust is affected by the  domain that it belongs to; Attribute 6 subjective: trust itself is not fact or evidence,  but knowledge of fact which the observer finds. It depends on the observer.

Attribute 7 uncertain: the uncertainty of trust is from unknowing other entity (and their behavior). So, the trust is a kind of hypothesis. It reflects the lacks of other entity information. It is a compensating for the forecast ability.

Attribute 8 fuzzy: because trust depends on observer and the subjectiveness and uncertainty of trust leads to that trust represent fuzzy, the trust has fuzzy character. As a kind of complex human knowledge, trust represents a character that it is hard to describe the trust itself in many situation.

4. TRUST MANAGEMENT MODEL IN DISTRIBUTE GIS  1996, M Blaze used the Trust Management (TM) concept firstly to resolve the safety problems of distributed system.

After that, many researchers make great effort in this area.

Form the earlier PGP trust management model, X.509 trust management model to time self-decay trust management model, fuzzy logic-Based subjective trust management  Figure1. Construction of distributed GIS  II - 1275    model, the trust management model reflect the character of trust expression in thought of human beings and natural language better and better.

In the base of studying cloud model, this article introduces it in distributed GIS. The time self-decay factor has been added to the trust management model based on cloud model. So, it can not only solve the safety problem in distributed GIS, but also represent good dynamic and fuzzy character.

4.1. Trust management model based on cloud model  In trust management model, trust is an evaluation of identity and behavior of an entity. It is related with the reliability, honesty and ability of the entity. The grades of trust are different from each other. Usually, trust is divided into several grades. It is called ?trust grade?.

There are two types of trust relationship between two entities. One is direct trust, the other is recommended trust.

Direct trust refers that the two entities has once exchanged directly. So, they build a direct trust relationship between them. The trust degree is from the direct experience according to the exchanging circumstance. Recommended trust refers that the two entities hasn?t exchanged directly, but build a trust relationship based on recommendation of other entities. The trust degree is according to the evaluation of other entities.

According cloud theory, cloud is a kind of model that uses language value to express uncertainty which is between some qualitative concept and quantitative representation. A qualitative description mechanism, which can reflect fuzzy character of trust and has intuitionistic and sententious semantics, needs to be established. The cloud model is suitable for this.

Trust cloud uses cloud model to express qualitative trust concept. Trust cloud consists of some cloud drop. TD= [0, 1] is quantitative domain of cloud. e  TS is qualitative trust concept in trust space. x  TD is a quantitative trust evaluation of qualitative trust concept e. The certainty (x)  [0, 1] is random.

: TD [0,1] x TD x (x), the distributing of x on  domain U is called ?trust cloud?. It is marked as TC(x).

Every x is called a cloud drop.

TD is trust degree space, TD= [0, 1]. It refers a close section from 0 to 1 on real number axis. The 0 represent completely untrusty and 1 represent completely trusty.

TS is trust space. It refers a set of trust grades. Every trust grade represents a qualitative trust concept. Trust grade is represented in nature language value.

Quantitative trust evaluation refers that an evaluation of element e in trust space TS= {e}. It is a mapping from trust space to trust degree space TD= [0, 1]. At the same time, the time self-decay factor should be considered in quantitative trust evaluation. So, the quantitative trust evaluation function is:  : TS  TD e  TS e (e, ), the  is time self-decay factor.

4.2. Application of trust cloud model  According to distributed GIS five layers model. The layers of inner node know each other. So, objective trust model is applied in accessing control. That is using authorization or authentication to secure the system safety of inner node.

Among the nodes in distributed GIS, the accessing of different layer uses the subjective trust model to limit the malicious entity. In this article, the subjective trust model is cloud model. The node in distributed GIS is entity in cloud model. Every time, that node A access node B can be considered as a quantitative evaluation in trust space of node A which is conducted by node B. The result of evaluation is mapped value of trust grade in trust degree space multiplying the value of time self-decay function.

Because of the confidential GIS data, the data accessing uses not only subjective trust management model, but also objective trust management model to validate the safety of visiting node. Only the visitor who passes the strict identity validation can access the spatial data.

7. Conclusion  Distributed GIS is important area of GIS development. The safety issue is one of the key problems in distributed GIS. In distributed system, the research of trust management model has made some progress. So, by introducing the up to date production in trust management model, the safety issue in distributed GIS can be solved in a good way. But because of the secret character of GIS  Spatial data, not all of the communication in distributed GIS can use trust management model. Currently, only the authorization can be used to secure the safety of the data. It must lead a reduction of the successful rate on distributed GIS communication.
