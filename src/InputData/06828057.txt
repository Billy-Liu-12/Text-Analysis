Illegal Access Point Detection Using Clock Skews  Method in Wireless LAN.

Abstract?Illegal Access Point called as Rogue Access Point (RAP) is an access point that has been installed on a secure network without explicit authorization from a system administrator Wireless Networks has big security threat  called Rough access points. If care is not taken and if this network threats are not detected and mitigated on time, this will result into the serious network damage and data loss. Every organization should give priority for Finding and avoiding rogue wireless access points. For detection of unauthorized AP?, we have use clock skew as a parameter of a wireless access point (AP). For detecting Rogue access point using clock skews method in wireless LAN network overcomes the limitations of existing solutions. For calculating clock skew of AP, we have use IEEE 802.11 Time Synchronization Function (TSF) time stamps sent out in the beacon/probe response frames. We mainly focus on implementation of least-square fit method for this purpose though we have explain both approach for detecting clock skew From this studies we came to known that use  of clock skews appears to be an effective and robust method for detecting fake AP?s in wireless local area networks.

I. INTRODUCTION Today the Internet has become essential requirement for  Businesses have long been plagued by unauthorized rogue access points that open wireless backdoors into wired networks. Large enterprises often invest in wireless intrusion prevention systems (WIPS) that use distributed sensors to keep a full-time eye on wireless traffic. The most effective way to mitigate rogue threats is 24/7 WIPS .But if your business can't afford WIPS.

Mobile phones, wireless laptops which are used to connect to the access point in the wireless local area network contain the WLAN card [10].The disadvantages of wireless LAN technology is that there are ways by which air traffic can be sniffed using network interface card in monitor or RFMON mode [12]. The care should be taken against wireless attacks such as disabling its SSID broadcasting, changing the default SSID and changing encryption mode to WEP (wired equivalent privacy) to WPA2. Laptops has Wireless LAN card which are in a monitor mode and that can be enabled by using different open source tools. This open source tool can be installed on the laptops and wireless air traffic can be sniffed very easily. On  Linux Kismet software is used to capture the air traffic of the wireless LAN and for Windows software like Netstumber can be used.

We explore the use of skew interval of a wireless local area network access point (AP) as its fingerprint to detect unauthorized APs quickly and accurately. The main goal behind using skew intervals is to overcome one of the major limitations of existing solutions?the inability to effectively detect Medium Access Control (MAC) addresses spoofing. We calculate the skew interval of an AP from the IEEE 802.11 Time Synchronization Function (TSF) time stamps sent out in the beacon/probe response frames. For calculating clock skews frame beacon frame we have used two approach based on linear programming and the other based on least-square fit.

Once we have calculated the clock skews of AP, which will acts as fingerprint of AP, and then we have use heuristic for differentiating packets from those sent by the Unapproved Aps and authorize AP. There is quantifying impact of various external factors including temperature variation, virtualization, skew source selection, and NTP synchronization on skew intervals. The use of skew intervals appears to be an efficient and robust method for detecting rough APs in wireless local area networks.



II. WIRELESS LAN Wireless LAN can be defined as network of wireless  devices that are interlinked with each other by wireless medium. WLAN provides a major advantage over the wired network as the end users can move in an area and remain connected with the network. It provides mobility and scalability with broad range of coverage area. This advantage has made this technology so popular among the end users that it is widely used in every field today.

A. Wireless Architecture All the devices in the wireless network are called stations.

Each station has a Wi-Fi network card (WNICs). They fall into two categories: access points and clients. The BSS area covered by WLAN has an identifier called Service set identifier (SSID). The following components are used in wireless LAN for establishing a wireless connection [19] -Basic service set (BSS): is referred to all the stations that can communicate with each other in wireless network. BSS     contain identifier (ID). ID is MAC address of the AP serving that BSS.

Fig. 1. Wireless Local area network    B. Working  of the WLAN WLAN architecture defines the components of wireless  network. To establish a connection between the devices there are generally five basic steps:  First is Scanning, process for finding wireless network in nearby region, stations uses scanning module to find the existing networks in that area. For this procedure they have to consider certain parameters listed below:  BSS can be with AP or without AP. This can be categorized as Ad-hoc or Infrastructure Networks  SSID (Network Name) with scanning type whether it is using active or passive technique and channel list on specify on that channel clients want to setup connection with probe delay parameter.



III. PROBLEMS IN IEEE 802.11 Apparently, it is harder to maintain consistent, robust and  secure communications in an IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN (Wi- Fi) than in Ethernet because of the nature of the wireless medium. In other words, several problems exist peculiarly in use of Wi-Fi: connectivity problems, performance problems and network security [8].

In utilization of radio signals, Wi-Fi cannot provide network users with consistent access to the Internet. For example, even in a small building that can be covered by an AP, such as a network cafe, some spaces are hidden from radio signals by obstacles. Such spaces are called ``dead spots'' or ``RF holes'', and typically this problem is resolved by deploying more APs [8].

Accordingly, since associations between APs and wireless stations are made by virtual wires in Wi-Fi, they are physically inconsistent and vulnerable to interference in surrounding  devices, such as a microwave oven and cordless phones as well as other APs operating nearby. Additionally, these virtual wires easily allow radio signals to take different paths to a destination, causing multipath propagation problem [15]. With respect to network security, one of the problems to be considered is installation of unauthorized APs or rogue APs [8]. Unsecured rogue APs are likely to be security holes for enterprise networks and could provide access to unauthorized users. Recently, problems caused by rogue APs have been very common, and installations of them are typically done by ignorant enterprise employees. In practice, detecting rogue APs, though more efficient ways have been developed, still counts on a very rudimentary way, where equipped IT personnel walk around the buildings catching beacons from wireless APs and identifying their MAC addresses.

On the other hand, for wireless network users, accessing unsecured APs that are not protected by passwords may raise a threat, nicknamed as ``evil twins''. Works in [16], reports that evil twins are dummy APs that are intentionally deployed by adversaries targeting to intercept sensitive data from associating wireless stations. Thus, during associations with evil twins, all transmitting packets could be logged and the ones without encryption could be analyzed thereafter.

Furthermore, evil twins often send stronger signals than legitimate APs in order to grab wireless connections from the legitimate ones [16].

However, even with encryption and pseudonyms, attackers with expertise can read user information and distinguish them from others by utilization of fingerprinting techniques (i.e., identify the sender of the packets) [17].



IV. WIRELESS SECURITY THREATS AND VULNERABILITIES The wireless network deployment is very critical in setting  up the security of the network. There are many attacks that have been defined and implemented on wireless networks [12] [11].

A. Types Of Attacks I have described certain known attacks on WLAN  [12][11].

1) MAC Spoofing : Reconfiguring an attacker's MAC address to pose as an authorized AP or station.

2)  War Driving: War driving, also called access point mapping, is the act of locating and possibly exploiting connections to wireless local area networks while driving around a city or elsewhere.

3) Eavesdropping: Capturing and decoding unprotected application traffic to obtain potentially sensitive information.

4)  Evil Twin AP: Masquerading as an authorized AP by beaconing the WLAN's service set identifier (SSID) to lure users.

5)  Man in the Middle: The attacker is in between sender and receiver. The sender sends the message to receiver but it passes through the attacker and sender and receiver is aware of this thing. This is called as Man in the Middle attack.

6) Rogue Access Points: Rogue Access Points is authorized access point which is present in WLAN.



V. RELATED WORK  A. Cryptographic Method The new wireless security enhancement 802.11i RSNA  (Robust Security Network Association) uses traditional cryptographic methods (i.e., digital certificates) to provide strong mutual authentication between wireless clients and the APs. Although this solution, if implemented properly, will make the fake AP attack less likely, the following practical issues can still make wireless networks using 802.11i RSNA vulnerable. First, management and verification of digital certificates across different domains are known to be cumbersome. Second, as the current AP selection algorithms use signal strength as the only criteria for AP selection, users can be fooled to connect to the fake AP that has higher signal strength compared to the original one but does not support any security measures such as RSNA. These facts motivate us to find a viable no cryptographic solution to the fake AP attack.

We emphasize that this solution is not meant to replace existing cryptographic methods. Rather, it should be used in conjunction with the cryptographic methods to achieve a higher level of security in WLANs. The current state-of-the art no crypto methods for unauthorized AP detection cannot detect fake APs.

Fig. 2. Fake access point detection scenario.

B. Fingerprint Technique We explore a passive online scheme that can detect fake  APs with high accuracy and minimum overhead. An AP?s clock skew acts as its fingerprint. Kohno and coauthors have shown that the clock skew of a device remains fairly consistent over time but the clock skews vary significantly across devices thereby arguing that the clock skew of a device can be used as its reliable fingerprint. However, Kohno?s scheme focused on wide area wired networks. Unlike Kohno?s scheme that uses TCP/ICMP time stamps, in our scheme, we use the Time Synchronization Function (TSF) time stamps. The AP send the beacon frame and we will use Time Synchronization Function  (TSF) time stamps for estimating the clock skews of AP. The use of beacons has several advantages.

1) First, beacons are sent all the time and at a fast rate (typically, 10 to 100 frames per second) independent of any application.

2) Second, the granularity of 802.11 TSF timers is 1 microsecond which is much higher than that of TCP time stamp clocks.

3)  Third, as the beacon time stamp is the actual time when an AP sends a frame (i.e., the time after the channel is sensed to be free) rather than the time when it is scheduled to send the frame, we do not need to consider any significant unpredictable delays incurred by the network as in the case of TCP time stamps.



VI. METHODOLOGY Number footnotes separately in superscripts In an IEEE  802.11 infrastructure WLAN, there are two methods that a client station (STA) may use to find an AP in the WLAN.

Active Scanning: The Client sends a probe request to AP to determine which APs are within range. The APs which are in range then reply back with probe response.

Passive Scanning: The STA learns about the APs in the WLAN by listening to the beacon frames broadcast by the APs.

The probe response and the beacon frames both have an 8 byte timestamp.

The time stamp field contains the value of TSF timer of the AP when it sends the frame. The beacons are scheduled to be sent at periodic intervals by the APs.

The time stamps in the beacon frames do not get affected by the random medium access delays of the wireless medium as hardware sets the time stamp value just before actual transmission. The 64 bit TSF timer of beacon frame initialized once at beginning and counter is incremented at ever microsecond. Our solution uses TSF time stamps in beacon/probe response frames to estimate the clock skew of an AP and uses the clock skew as the AP?s fingerprint.

Fig. 3. Beacon Frame Structure  Let us assume that a finger-printer node (a WIDS node) has received n beacon frames from a particular AP. Let the time stamp in the ith beacon frame be Ti and let ti be the time in microsecond when the finger-printer receives the ith beacon frame. Finger-printer captures beacon frames sent by the fingerprinted AP.

The beacon frames captured using a passive scanning approach from the wireless network and extracted the timestamp information from frames to determine its accuracy.

The beacon frames has ?timeval? field which is used to keep track of the time during communication in the network. By using ?timeval? field of beacon frame we can calculate the clock skew value of AP. A Fake AP usually copies the value for ?timeval? field from the source beacon frame. It takes nearly the same clock skew from the authorized AP.

But if authorized AP reconstruct the beacon frame, and retransmit it, then the delay of a few microseconds is injected.

But the sequence number of reconstructed frame is different one than original one, so here we come to know that this is fake AP.

Let,  Si= be the total size of the ith beacon frame  Ri = be the data rate at which ith beacon frame is sent.

Therefore, the time, according to the AP?s clock, when the finger-printer receives the packet is  Ti  + Si/Ri.

Let our estimated offset for the ith frame be denoted oi and the time difference between the first received frame and the ith frame according to the finger-printer?s clock be Xi. Then,  Xi=ti-t1                                        (1) Oi = ((Ti+Si/Ri)-(T1+S1/R1))-(ti-t1)           (2)  In most of the cases, the beacon frames are sent at a fixed- data rate and the size of the beacon frames remain fixed as well. So, we can assume that Si / Ri =S1/R1.

These yields,  Oi = (Ti-T1)-(ti-t1)                                                           (3)  For calculating clock skew from off-set, we can use two method first one is linear-programming-based method (LPM) and second one is a least-square fit (LSF) method.

A.  Linear Programming Method LPM finds a line x+ , where  is the slope of the line and  is the y-axis intercept, that upper bounds the points in the clock offset-set of the AP and outputs the slope of the line , as the clock skew estimate, so our clock skew estimation  is such that =1?. .

. + 0 ,  And the following function is minimized:  (4)    The LPM method minimizes the effect of any unpredictable delays as it has higher tolerance toward outliers. Interestingly, LPM?s nature to tolerate the outliers may cause a serious security problem in our context [20]. If an adversary is able to mix small number of beacons from a fake AP with the beacons of the authorized one, it is faking, and if the clock skew of the fake AP is close to the clock skew of authorized one. Then there may be chances that this method may consider the fake AP frames as outliers and estimate the clock skew of the  authorized AP as the clock skew of the set [20]. In this case, it will be difficult to detect the fake AP by comparing the clock skews.

B.  Least Square Fitting Method We can also use LSF to estimate the clock skew of an AP  from its clock offset-set. Given an offset-set(X1, O1),?.., (Xn,On), LSF finds line + , where  is the slope of the line and  is the y-intercept such that    (5)    Equation (2) remains minimum. The slope of the line  is estimated as the clock skew of the clock offset-set. One of the major differences of LSF from LPM is its lack of tolerance toward outliers. Even if there are only a very few outliers, the clock skew estimated by LSF significantly from the clock-skew determined by the majority of the points. This can cause problems while estimating clock skew from noisy data. Kohno et al. decided not to use LSF for estimation of TCP clock skew because TCP segments can undergo random delays in the network which can affect the accuracy of the clock skew estimate. Therefore, we can use the LSF to estimate clock skews effectively.

LSF has an advantage over LPM in the scenario where an adversary tries to avoid detection by interspersing frames from a fake AP with the frames from the authorized one as described above. LSF?s sensitivity to the presence of even a small number of outliers will help determining the fake AP in the above scenario more effectively than LPM. So, it will be difficult for the adversary to masquerade frames from the fake AP as outlying data when LSF is used to estimate the clock skew.



VII. IMPLEMENTATION In our implementation for capturing beacon frames,  recording time stamps, and computing clock skews of APs on two laptops?Dell 4GB RAM having I3 processor running Windows and an Dell 2GB RAM having Dual-core processor running Windows. The access point we have used is TP-LINK.

Along with this we have used MadWifi driver and for running this on windows we have used TCP Dump?s deemed version.

We use wireless card? Intel PRO. The Intel PRO card uses an Atheros chipset that works with the MadWifi driver. We chose this card because it support the monitor mode and also because their drivers are open source. The availability of the source code allows us to modify the drivers to measure the arrival time of beacon frames with higher resolution as described below. As the success of our methodology is closely tied to how precisely we can measure time, most of our implementation effort targets obtaining high-precision time measurements. In order to accurately estimate the clock skew of an AP, we need to precisely measure the time when a beacon frame reaches the wireless LAN card of the finger printer. For Windows we have used jNetpcap application and wincap .Wincap which is used to lift our application so that we can access and records the beacon frames.

1/n =0     Wincap application uses the TCP-Dump application and Madwifi-driver for accessing the Beacon Frames.

Therefore, the clock skew of an AP can be estimated quickly and accurately with a 1 microsecond?s precision clock at finger printer?s end.



VIII. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS We use experimental traces from our laboratory settings to  test our methodology for detecting unauthorized APs. First we have collected set of trace data during the experimental setting.

We have one authorized access point named as TP-LINK.

We have created one unauthorized access point. Any laptop connected to authorize access point which intimate original beacon frames and act as Access Point. Like if we will make a Laptop as WIFI hotspot. When we start WIFI hotspot which is connected to Authorized Access Point will itself send beacon frames and act as Access Point for Laptops in its range.

We have put our implementation for detection of fake Access point on one laptop which is also called as WIDS node.

The task of WIDS node is to continuously monitor the WLAN for detecting the fake access point. We have store authorized access point clock skews values as its fingerprint on one machine. And this data is use for differentiate between fake AP from Authorized Access point.The below shown result of LPM and LSF method of clock skews are measure in part per million unit (ppm).

TABLE I.  CLOCK SKEWS ESTIMATION  No. of packets examined  Clock skews estimation Skew(Using LPM) Skew(Using LSF)  100 30.29 ppm 19.74 ppm  200 11.033 ppm 34.71 ppm 300 24.10 ppm 51.86 ppm  400 29.17 ppm 26.86 ppm   A. Differentiating Frames of Fake Access Point We Differentiation between the clock offset-sets of the fake  AP(s) and the authorized AP (if present) will help us to detect fake AP.

For example, if the attacker uses multiple fake APs to fake one authorized AP, we can detect the fake APs by separating the clock offset-sets. However, the main disadvantage of GHT is that it is computationally rigorous and requires a big amount of storage. Even though techniques like Randomized Hough Transform (RHT) try to minimize these effects But the Randomized Hough Transform (RHT) still require large amount of time. The use of GHT is justified in the domain of image processing and computer graphics because images normally contain large number of edges and GHT can detect all of them together. However, in our case we expect to have very few lines. Algorithm requires the initial parameters to be guessed and the accuracy of the results depend on the values of those initial parameters. Furthermore, EM requires multiple  iterations to converge. In our problem domain, we have some specific characteristics of the data that help the APs. The general problem of fitting multiple lines to a data set is not new. In the domain of computer vision and image processing, Generalized Hough Transform (GHT) is a well-known technique that can be used for this purpose. Another approach to solve the problem of fitting multiple lines to a data set is to model the data as a mixture model and apply the well known statistical method of expectation maximization (EM) to separate the data.

The thickness of the lines in the clock offset-set plot (i.e., the variance of the points in the set) remains mostly constant across the APs.

The amount of noise in the data is negligible. Keeping these facts in mind and borrowing ideas from both of the above mentioned methods; we design a lightweight heuristic that solves our problem efficiently. Our heuristic relies on the fact that if a clock offset-set is calculated from the beacons received from different APs, then the clock skew will contain certain (i.e., sudden big changes in the value) at the boundary. The value of threshold can be estimated empirically from the clock offset-set of a single AP. Our results show that the value of threshold estimated by timestamps. Our heuristic identifies these jumps and differentiates the data based on it. We exploit this fact to differentiate packets from different APs.

Let  be the relative skew between two samples in the clock offset-set, (Xi, Yi) and (Xj, Yj) ?    is defined as follows:    Where  is the absolute value? We introduce a tunable parameter called threshold to differentiate between jump and consistent increment. Thus, two consecutive points (Xi, Yi) and (Xj, Yj) in the clock offset-set are considered to be a jump if and only if > threshold. Using this definition of jump we can segregate the clock offset-set data into separate .Once the datasets are separated using the above heuristic, we can use either LPM or LSF based methods to estimate the exact clock skew of different fake APs.

In graph shown below the red slop line determined the clock skew of authorized AP. This clock skew is calculated at the time of testing done in laboratory. This value is stored in database.

The blue line is clock skew value of AP for which we want to determine whether it is authorized or fake. Once we have estimated the clock skew of that AP, we will compare this data with authorized data stored in database.

If the blue line is above the red line then it is unauthorized AP. If the blue line is below the red line then authorized AP is detected.

In below shown graph, the blue line is below the red line so authorized AP is detected.

IX. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK As now days it is very easy to set up a successful rogue AP,  this will result in major security problem. We have existing techniques for detecting rogue AP, but that technique has certain kinds of limitation. Disadvantage of manual Radio Frequency is that. RF scanning requires more time and it is tedious, which Detect rogue AP only, when scanning is applied. RF scanning method is also do impact on the costing and also it is not so effective and accurate. Automatic scanning depend on signs of APs (viz. MAC address, SSID, etc.) which is ineffective when a rogue AP spoofs signatures. But our approach, rogue AP detection with clock skew method overcome this drawbacks and prove effective and robust method of detecting rogue access point.

We have mainly focused on identifying wireless vulnerabilities and security threats for the end users and finding solution to combat them. This work provides solution for the problem of how to handle it. Some of the future work. We want to do in this, to enhance the features of the research work line such as developing and implementing an independent location finding techniques to track down the location of the  wirelessdevices with other parameters.We also would like to make a complete intrusion detection system by implementing more detection programs for different attacks available on WLAN.
