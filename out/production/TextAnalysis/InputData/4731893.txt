The Logic Properties of Association Rules and its application

Abstract:  In this paper it firstly attends to the theoretical foundations of data mining technologies, especially the association rules discovering. Several classes of association rules are defined such as transitive quantifiers, double transitive quantifiers and founded-equivalent transitive quantifiers, e.t. and discussed these properties of some 4ft quantifiers.

Then based on the procedure 4ft-Miner some experiments was turn out and the flexible result was excellent. In the later give their relationship among them and the future works about this problem.

1. Introduction   The rapidly growing volume and complexity of  modern data makes the need for technologies to describe and distill the information which contain increasingly important content for us.

In this paper we will contribute to the theoretical foundations of data mining, especially dealing with association rules. We are not interested in ?classical? association rules of the form X ? Y where X and Y are sets of items, here the intuitive meaning of the rule X ? Y is that transactions (e.g. supermarket baskets) containing set X of items tend to contain set Y of items[1]. Association rule mining is an important area of data mining and has been widely applied in many fields[2].

The association rule[3] is here understood as an expression ? ? ?  where ? and ?  are Boolean attributes derived from columns of an analyzed data matrix(that is object-attribute 2-dimension table). The intuitive meaning of the association rule? ? ? is that Boolean attributes ? and ? are associated in a way corresponding to the symbol .  ?  A constraint Logic based discrete network was developed to perform various tasks: to infer and to check properties from observations and to perform qualitative simulations[4]. Observational calculi approved as a tool for study logical properties of association rules[5].The class of association rules with the F-property is  introduced[6].

The output of the these procedure is a list of all  prime hypotheses. The hypothesis is prime if both it is true and it does not immediately follow from other output hypotheses.

The outline of this paper is putting out the back- ground of the association rules in Section 2; giving our main results of the transitive quantifiers in Section 3; then presenting several experiments to check the effect of those results in Section 4; at last getting conclusion and the future prospect in Section 5.

2.The background to logic of association rules   The classical association rules of the form X ? Y  where X and Y are sets of items, which meaning that the rule X ? Y is that transactions (e.g. supermarket baskets) containing set X of items tend to contain set Y of items [4].

Two measures of intensity of the association rule are used, confidence and support. The association rule discovery task is to find all association rules of the form X ? Y such that the support and confidence of X ? Y are above the user defined thresholds minsup and minconf respectively.

We understand the association rule as the expression ? ?  and ?  where ? ?  are the Boolean attributes. The meaning of the association rule ? ?  and ?  is that the Boolean attributes ? ?  are associated in the way given by the symbol ? , which is called 4ft-quantifier. It denotes a condition concerning a four-fold contingency table of ? and ? .

Various types of dependencies of ?  and ? (e.g.

implication or equivalence) can be expressed in this way.

The Boolean attributes ?  and ?  are derived from the basic Boolean attributes and from propositional connectives ,  and  in a usual way. The basic Boolean attribute is the expression of  ? ? ?  International Symposium on Intelligent Information Technology Application Workshops  DOI 10.1109/IITA.Workshops.2008.31         the form ? ( ) where { ,?, } and { ,?, } is the set of all values of the attribute  ? ? 	 1a ta  1a ta ? . The basic Boolean attribute ? (? ) is true in the row of the analysed data matrix if it is  where  is the value of the attribute  a ?  a ?  in this row. The association rule:  ? 1? ( )1? ? 2? ( )2? ? 3? ( ) 3? is an example of the association rule we are going to deal with. Here ,  and  are the subsets of the sets of all possible values of the respective attributes  1? 2? 3?  1? , 2?  and 3? .

The 4ft quantifier  in the association rule ?  ? ? ?   denotes a condition concerning a four-fold contingency table of ?  and ? . The meaning of the association rule ? ? ?  is that the Boolean attributes ?  and ?  are associated in the way determined by the 4ft quantifier . ?  The association rule ? ? ?  can be true or false in the analyzed data matrix M. The association rule ? ? ?  is verified on the basis of the four-fold table 4ft(? , ? , M) of ?  and ?  in M, see Table 1.

Here a is the number of the objects (i.e. the rows of M) satisfying both ? and ? , b is the number of the objects satisfying?  and not satisfying ? , c is the number of objects not satisfying ?  and satisfying? and d is the number of objects satisfying neither ? nor ? .

Table 1 ft(? , ? , M) M ?  ? ? ?  a B ??  c D  So writing 4ft(? , ? , M) = <a, b, c, d>, sometimes using the abbreviation ?4ft? instead of the expression ?four-fold table?. The notion 4ft table is used for all possible tables 4f t(? , ? , M).

Here we define that 4ft table is a quadruple <a, b, c, d> of the integer non-negative numbers a, b, c, d such that a + b + c + d > 0. We write (a, b, c, d) = 1, if the condition corresponding to the 4ft quantifier  ? ? is  satisfied for the quadruple <a, b, c, d>of integer nonnegative numbers; otherwise we write (a, b, c, d) = 0. In addition we let r be a +b, k be a +c and n be a +  b + c + d, seeing Table 2.

?  Table 2 ft table 4ft(? , ? , M) M ? ? ? ?  a b r ?? c d  k  n Extended by r, k and n.Various kinds of dependencies of  the Boolean attributes ?  and ?  can be expressed by suitable 4ft quantifiers, as following[3]: ? The 4ft-quantifier of founded  implication for 0 p?1 and Base 0 is defined by the condition:  Basep ,?  ba a ?  ?p? a?Base  ? The 4ft-quantifier of lower critical  implication for 0 p?1 , 0  !

The 4ft-quantifier of E-equivalence for  0?1 and Base 0 is defined by the condition:  E Base,~?  max( ba  b ?  , dc  c ?  ) ? ? a?Base  To proof our conclusions below we need two lemmas[3]: Lemma 1. Let M>0, 0?L<M and N?0 be integer numbers and let 0<p<1 be a real number. Then it is  ? ?? ?  ??  ?? ???? ?  ? ?? ?  ? ?NM  NLi  iNMi pp i  NM  ? ?? ?  ???? ?  ? ?? ?  ?M  Li  iMi pp i  M 1 .

Lemma 2. Let M>0, 0?L<M and 0?L?M-N be integer numbers and let 0<p<1 be a real number. Then it is  ? ?? ?  ?  ?? ???? ?  ? ?? ?  ? ?NM  Li  iNMi pp i  NM  ? ?? ?  ???? ?  ? ?? ?  ?M  Li  iMi pp i  M   3.The transitive property of association rules   The classes of association rules are defined by the  rules with classes of 4ft quantifiers. J. Rauch[9-11]had discussed some classes of 4ft quantifiers such as implicational quantifiers, double implicational quantifiers, equivalence quantifiers and - equivalence quantifiers. The association rule  ?  ? ? ? is one of the classes of implicational association rules if the 4ft quantifier  is one of the classes of implication quantifiers. In this case we also say that the association rule  ?  ? ? ? is implicational association rule and that the 4ft quantifier  is implicational quantifier. This is the same for additional classes of association rules and so the others.

?  Now we are going to suggest several other classes of 4ft quantifier about transitivity.

We concentrate on transitive quantifiers (Section 3.1), double transitive quantifiers (Section 3.2), ? -double transitive quantifiers (Section 3.3) and founded-equivalent transitive quantifiers(Section 3.4) because presented theoretical results concern these classes.

3.1. Transitive Quantifiers   When we meet this situation that we have two  association rues of ? ? ? and ? ? ? , you will ask the question whether we have ? ? ? , so here we are going to give you the answer of this. At first we define this transitive property of the 4ft-quantifier as such: Definition 1. The 4ft quantifier  is transitive if  ? ? (a, b, c, d) = 1? ? ( a?, b?, c?, d?)=1 ?max(a, ? a ?? a? )? b ?? ?min(b, b? ) implies ( a??, b??, c??, d??)= 1, for all 4ft tables<a, b, c, d>, < a?, b?, c?, d?> and < a??, b??, c??, d??>.

?  Now we have the following conclusion.

Proposition 1. The 4ft-quantifier of founded implication is transitive.

Basep ,?  For the proofing we would show if  Basep ,?  (a, b, c, d) = 1?  ( a?, b?, c?, d?)=1 Basep ,? ? a ?? ?max(a, a? )? b ?? ?min(b, b ) implies  ?  Basep ,?  (a??, b??, c??, d??)= 1. It is true following from a ?? ?max(a, a? )and b ?? ?min(b, ): b?  ba a  ????? ??  ? ba  a ???  ? ?p or  ba a  ????? ??  ? ba  a ?  ?p.

Remark 1. From the discussion above we know that the transitive quantifiers is depend only the items of a and b in <a, b, c, d>, otherwise the items of c and d.

3.2. Double Transitive Quantifiers           Here we think about the more rigorously restricting  of the transitive quantifiers and get the new one as such: Definition 2. The 4ft quantifier  is double transitive if  ?  ? (a, b, c, d) = 1 ( a?, b?, c?, d?)=1? ?max(a, ) ?min(b, ) ?min(c, ) implies  ? ? a ?? a? ? b ?? b? ? c ?? c?  ? ( a??, b??, c??, d??)= 1 for all 4ft tables<a, b, c, d>, < a?, b?, c?, d?> and < a??, b??, c??, d??>.

Several 4ft quantifiers are Double Transitive, for example.

Proposition 2. The 4ft-quantifier of double founded implication is transitive.

Basep ,?  For the proofing we would show if  Basep ,?  (a, b, c, d) = 1   (a?, b?, c?, d?)=1 ?max(a, a ) ?min(b, b )  ?min(c, )  implies  ? Basep ,? ? a ?? ? ? b ?? ?  ? c ?? c? Basep ,?  (a??, b??, c??, d??)= 1.

It is true following from ?max(a, )and  ?min(b, ): a ?? a?  b ?? b?  cba a  ???????? ??  ? cba  a ?????  ? ?p or  cba a  ???????? ??  ? cba  a ??  ?p.

Remark 2. From the discussion above we know that the double transitive quantifiers is depend only the items of a, b and c in <a, b, c, d>, otherwise the items of d.

3.3. - Double Transitive Quantifiers ?   For checking the transitivity of the 4ft quantifiers of  and , we found that they all used the sum of a+b+c. So it resulted in the definition of the class of -double transitive quantifiers.

Basep ,? !

,, Basep ?  ? Definition 3. The 4ft quantifier is -double transitive if  ? ?  ? (a, b, c, d) = 1 ( a?, b?, c?, d?)=1? ?max(a, ) + ?min(b+c, + c ) implies  ? ? a ?? a? ? b ?? c ?? b? ?  ? ( a??, b??, c??, d??)= 1 for all 4ft tables<a, b, c, d>, < a?, b?, c?, d?> and < a??, b??, c??, d??>.

So the 4ft quantifier Basep ,?  of founded double implication is ? -double transitive, the proof is obvious from proposion 2. But the 4ft quantifier  of lower critical double implication is also ! ,, Basep ? ? -double transitive, and now give the proofing.

Proposition 3. The 4ft-quantifier of lower  critical double implication for 0 p?1, 0  !

,, Basep ?  0.5 and Base 0 is defined by the condition:  ? ? icbai cba  ai pp  i cba ?????  ?  ??? ?  ? ?? ?  ? ??? 1 ? ? a?Base is ? -double transitive.

Proof: What we have to do is to prove that if  ? ? icbai cba  ai pp  i cba ?????  ?  ??? ?  ? ?? ?  ? ??? 1 ? ,  ? ? icbai cba  ai pp  i cba ???????????  ??  ??? ?  ? ?? ?  ? ?????? 1 ? and a ?? ?max(a, a? ) ? b ?? + ?min(b+c, c ?? b? + c? ) then also  ? ? icbai cba  ai pp  i cba ?????????????????  ???  ??? ?  ? ?? ?  ? ????????? 1 ? Noting that a ?? ?max(a, ) so k?0, s.t. a??+  b??+c??=a(or a? ?  a? )+ b ?? + c ?? + k, according to Lemma 1 we have  ? ? icbai cba  ai pp  i cba ?????????????????  ???  ??? ?  ? ?? ?  ? ????????? 1 ?  ? ? icbai cba  ai pp  i cba ?????????????  ?  ??? ?  ? ?? ?  ? ??????? 1  (or ? ? icbai cba  ai pp  i cba ???????????????  ??  ??? ?  ? ?? ?  ? ???????? 1 ); And from the condition b + ?min(b+c, ?? c ??  b? + c? ) so ? t?0, s.t. a(or a? )+ b ?? + c ?? =a+b+c+k(or + +a? b? c? +k), according to Lemma 2 we have  ? ? icbai cba  ai pp  i cba ?????????????  ?  ??? ?  ? ?? ?  ? ??????? 1  (or ? ? icbai cba  ai pp  i cba ???????????????  ??  ??? ?  ? ?? ?  ? ???????? 1 )?         ? ? icbai cba  ai pp  i cba ?????  ?  ??? ?  ? ?? ?  ? ??? 1  (or )?? ? icbai cba  ai pp  i cba ???????????  ??  ??? ?  ? ?? ?  ? ?????? 1  .

Hereto we finish the proving.

3.4. Founded-equivalently Transitive Quantifiers  Corresponding to the 4ft-quantifier of  founded equivalence and the 4ft-quantifier of lower critical equivalence, here give the definition of founded- equivalently transitive quantifiers.

Basep ,? !

,, Basep ?  Definition 4. The 4ft quantifier is founded- equivalently transitive if (a, b, c, d) = 1 ( a?, b?, c?, d?)=1 a???max(a,a?) b??min(b, b?) c???min(c, c?) d???max(d, d?)  implies  ( a??, b??, c??, d??)= 1 for all 4ft tables<a, b, c, d>, < a?, b?, c?, d?> and < a??, b??, c??, d??>.

? ? ? ?  ? ? ? ?  ?  Now to think about the 4ft-quantifier  and  , they are all founded-equivalently transitive, the proofing like those propositions above.

,, Basep ?   4 Experiments   For checking the effects of the results discussed  aboved, using of two synthesize data sets: (T10I4D100k and T25I10D10k), and a public data set(Connect-4: http://miles.cnuce.cnr.it/~palmeri/data m/DCI/datasets.php) with strong correlation.

And some experiments were taken out to validate TOSCU compared with OSCU. But some works need to do such as following: ? the hypothesis is prime if it is both true and it does  not immediately follow from other output hypotheses;  ? it need include the imbedding the rules notation, using as interfusing there under;  ? the efficiency of TOSCU for the large scale multi-relational data.
