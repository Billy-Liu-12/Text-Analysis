I. INTRODUCTION  The lack of fideism upon the public transport infrastructure led the travelers to shift to their own private car. The requirement of a reliable public transport monitoring structure is the outcome from the unnecessary congestions of traffic observed due to steep increment in personal vehicle. A large scale dedicated monitoring infrastructure with reliable displaying position for public transport can facilitate passengers to revolutionize the trend from own vehicle to public transport as well international image of a city [1,2].

Intelligent Transportation system (ITS) has witnessed tremendous growth over last few years. It is adopting implementation of newest technology, specifically a network of sensors, microchips, and communication devices that collect and disseminate information about the functioning of the transportation system. Transportation systems are really about networks, and much of the value of a network is contained in its information [3,4]. Navigation sensors in cooperating road networks could audibly alert the real time vehicle information down to the bus stations. In the past the traffic monitoring infrastructure has mainly consisted of dedicated equipment, such as loop detectors, cameras, and radars. Installation and maintenance expenses discourage the deployment of these technologies for the entire transport network. Moreover, inductive loop detectors are prone to errors and malfunctioning (daily in California, 30% out of 25,000 detectors do not work properly according to the PeMS system 1) [5].

Through the advent of GPS technology, conventional positioning methods have been replaced. As far as the vehicle   fleet management and monitoring is concerned, one of the main applications of the GPS technology is the fleet monitoring in urban or suburban areas, from a central monitoring station (reference station) [6]. Lee SY, and Han SW [7] investigated the overseas GPS implemented case towards its application in Korea. Moreover, the location data transmission link had also been the subject of keen interest for several researches. The numbers of studies are found using GPRS for the vehicle monitoring to an IP fix control center.

The vast utilization of embedded system is also observed for receiving, matching and transmission location data [8-10].

Positioning and tracking of construction vehicles in highly dense urban are tending to reviewed the previous radio frequency (RF) -related research in construction and further evaluated the pros and cons of several RF -based technologies including GPS, RFID, and Bluetooth for monitoring and applying GPS [11].

After the influential approach chosen for monitoring vehicle motion using cell phones, cell tower signal information is subjected to utilize to identify the handset's location. An idea for intelligent fleet management system incorporates the power of concurrent GPS for navigation and Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) for real-time positioning, frontend intelligent and web-based management software [12].

A Forecast model and policy guidelines for building Buses information system! Buses monitoring system BISIBMS with Wireless Communication System in Korea is presented by Bong [13]. According to this research, BIS and BMS are an integrated system applicable to existing bus operating systems that encompasses GPS and IT features such as information, computers, electronics, controls and so on. It is a field in ITS (Intelligent Transport System) that enhances the efficiency of bus usage. But practically, the cellular network based monitoring system for public transport may cause various drawbacks including unavailability of service, server down, no network coverage and cost consuming even after implementation. In[14] a review paper, it is intend to evaluate the technical feasibility of applying emerging wireless network technologies for resources tracking at building construction sites. Based on critical reviews of available localization methods and state-of-the-art wireless communication technologies, it is identified that the Zig-Bee-based wireless sensor network and the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) method are most promising for solving on-site resources tracking problems.

Regarding other intelligent techniques, Design of experiments (D OE) had been a useful tool that used for exploring new processes, gaining increased knowledge of the exiting processes and optimizing these processes to achieving a     better performance [19]. Dynamic and foremost important tool of design of experiment (DOE), wherein the relationship between responses of a process with its input decision variables is mapped to achieve the objective of maximization or minimization of the response properties [20].



II. PR OP OSED FRAMEWORK: THE C ONCEPT  Real-time traffic conditions for virtually every bus stop in the city have the ability to change the trend of a traveler from using their personal vehicle to the single public transport. In this paper, it is given an embedded system based design in cooperating navigation sensor and wireless mash networks for public transport monitoring. After experimental analysis, an intelligent equation is developed using RSM, which will improve the traditional map matching as well as help to create a reliable communication links between the remote modules.

During an informal survey to the roads of KL, many problems are commonly observed which must consider during framework designing. Like many time buses having same IDs draw closer together. Sometime bus stops are found in front of each other across the road. The conceptual solution suggested for the difficulties found, are the scheming of our system using GPS based monitoring and their location transmission down to the specific bus stops only found on their routes, not even at the bus stop found across the road as exposed in Fig.l below. This specific location transmission is actually the function of specially configured transceivers and initially inputs by the drivers.

Conceptual frame work of IPTMS  In order to elaborate the conceptual framework, an example is taken into account containing three buses with different routes named A, B and C and 6 bus stops with different route location named U, V, W, X, Y and Z. Bus ID "A" will pass through bus stop W and X. It can be observed from figure that bus stop X and Y are found in front each other and there is a sound possibility for Y to receive the signal from bus "A". This problem is figure out by giving dedicated PAN ID same as the bus 10. Let suppose, the bus A have its 10 'B 103', then transceiver modules of bus "A" and its stops W and X are configured "0 I 03" as PAN ID. Through this scheme, the bus is made responsible to communicate or to send its location information to its relevant bus stops, not even the one found in front or in range.



III. FRAME WORK DESIGNING  Given the lack of an established body of research on the design of public transport network services and the small number 0 of practitioners concerned in this field, a quantitative approach seemed inappropriate in relation to the nature of the enquiry. For the purpose, initially some rules and regulations are described as the initial system assumptions. These assumptions are described to make the proposed frame work as resourceful as possible. Second is the hardware implementable design, the center of focus of this study, for the overall system to work. This phase contains best functional components selection according to the proposed design.

A. Assumption  The frame work presented in the methodology below, is based on the following some assumptions must be imposed by the regulators: (1) Each bus route is isolated entities, are assigned similar activities; (2) the inter-linked network of nodes represents the service along a bus route and hence the efficiency of the network is equivalent to that of the service provided along the route; (3) buses of same IDs are sent by a proper interval of time. In case, any two or more buses of same IDs join each other due to any reason then 2nd one need to stop for the time until first one reach at the next bus stations; (4) Buses' driver are strictly ensured not to change the predefined route. In case any emergency, they are restricted to inform to the monitoring room so that the monitoring plan could be change to facilitate the passengers.

B. System description  The design assures the real time processing of data related to monitor the position of the bus and more towards its implementation through notification system for passengers. In order to ensure the exact monitoring at the particular bus stations, several measures have been designed like at the starting of every journey, the driver is restricted to input some data using keypad same as unique bus ID. Complexity is ensured to reduce by dividing the whole presented system in into two basic parts; master part and slave part 1, 2 and so on, as described in the concept, depending on number of bus stations.

C. Master module  Master module integration: Given the design needs and requirement for the problem, it is proposed to come up with the simplest and efficient design that would be able to forecast the real time localization down to the respective node. In order to construct an appropriate design of master module, several best functioning components are selected. In this section of methodology, there are three key modules used in master node: MCU: PIC 16f877A, GPS module: Parallex RXM-SG GPS Module and the advanced wireless: Xbee pro RF Modules (IEEE802.1S.4). In the integrated system, RSM is adopted to minimize the location data for better, reliable and time saving comparison and transmission. On the basis of prescribed dedicated equipment, prototype system architecture was build to present optimized experimental results. Two different types of experiments are conducted to exploit the modules. Firstly the equation obtained from RSM is validated using the master module. The efficient outcomes from the     proposed heuristic will be shown in results section. Second is to analyze the one way communication for sending bus unique ID and one digit bus stop number from the master node to the nearest determined slave node. This determination is done by assigning the XBEEs of master and three slave module prototype (representing single route with its relevant bus), a unique PAN 10., a number shared amongst each Xbee in a network. A single network may contain many more nodes since XBEEs on different networks do not communicate with each other. The configurations of the RF modules are carried out using X-CTU software. It allows setting all of the parameters using a Graphical User Interface.

Data collection for master module: The lack of exact data forwarding, missing data or time delay may play a considerable role against the resource full communication and real time implementation of the system. There are found many reasons beside like dense urban traffic, long buildings and atmospheric effect on data rate and reliability. Besides, there are also found some error possibilities of exact MM comparison, since the master node (bus) is observed, do not stop on the predefined slave node (bus stops). This lead the research to create idea of reduced amount of the data to be compared and forward. To tackle this issue, this work is inspired by the fact that vehicles move along routes with a known map, which means the characteristics of the predictable vehicle mobility and the road network layout can be find out.

In all, approximately 40 minutes of driving, data were collected over 11 set of coordinates from bus stops. The map and table below shows the bus stops chosen to collect static position data. From the casual observation, it is found that during one full journey from first until last stop, there are few digits from the longitude and latitude are subject to be changed while some remained unchanged. Table I below shows the actual static   address of bus stops. For an autonomous passive localization transmission loop, 5 significant digits from longitude and latitude are selected to be as the raw data for our MCU to be trained. The apprehension behind this selection was the consistency of the degree digits throughout one full journey and last bit of second does not cast any effect on calculating the bus stop number. The coordinate's data is collect from bus route B 1 03. This data with their convincing possibilities are taken as the input to the RSM training. The methods and outcomes will be shown in results section.

Data Pre-Processing: Prior to using data above for experimental testing, pre-processing was needed to generate data sets containing the necessary information for the system.

In light of the screening observation, a decision was taken to study the effects of the four significant factors, namely; longitude M, longitude S, latitude M and latitude S.

Furthermore, parking violation on the pre identified bus stops have potential to produce unwanted outputs or malfunctioning     for MM. The parking at bus stops is crucial part of the study for having proper MM and triggering of RF modules. In order to avoid the error due to mismatching, each selected data set of coordinate are fragmented in to three more probabilities.

The possibilities are recorded by observing the location coordinates just little before and after the exact bus stop.

These possibilities are elected to utilized as input to get the response as predicted one digit bus stop number. The four variables, their levels and possibilities are listed in Table II.



IV. EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS  The aim of the research is to optimize one single route's coordinates into its single digit representative through D OE.

The techniques applied have a clear potential to provide a reliable public transport monitoring system by a reduced amount of data to compare for MM and obviously the time (data rate) saving. This paper also explores and identifies a unique design phase containing a system to mount GPS based embedded system with sophisticated RF transceiver on every bus and at the bus station. This section analyzes and evaluates the main results obtained from both of the tasks. The evaluation is carried out by observing three aims;  ? Predicted output eq.(l) vs actual observation for bus stop number by RSM (AN OV A).

? Validation through MCU for accuracy measure.

? Time reduction claim during MM for 1 digit output  comparison vs casual necessary 17 digits for coordinates.

A. Analysis a/Variance (ANOVA)  The presented technique is aimed to develop the input? output relationships for prediction of bus stop ID. In order to arrive at the most influential variables and its effects a phase strategies were proposed. Response surface methodology (RSM) based on CCD was utilized to develop a linear model for prediction. RSM are used to estimate the transfer functions at the optimal region.

It can be seen that the model F-value of 906.18 implies the model is significant. There is only a 0.0 I % chance that a "Model F-Value" could occur. The reason behind this could be the irregular behavior of the coordinates as input.

Values of probability less than 0.0500 indicates model terms will produce a minor difference among the trained and actual response.

A mathematical prediction model has been developed based on the most influencing factors and the validation simulation analysis proved its adequacy. The result aimed towards prediction of bus stop number and its effect on received coordinate's data. The von Mises and displacement equation representing the selected route's coordinates is expressed in Eq. (I).

P = 25.20266832 + l.321582163*A + 0.02467396989*B - 7.753245435*C-  0.1525904315*D  Where, P = Predicted bus stop number A = Longitude Minutes B = Longitute Second C = Latitude Minute D = Latitude Second  The eq.l obtained gave a simple dimension of particular bus stop number. The simplicity of the equation encouraged the researcher to use the RSM. This present form of the equation is uncomplicated to train the MCU using the parameters of data. The all four parameter are programmed in the MCU to receive as the long integers continuously. Instead of comparing digit by digit of all location coordinates, the above equation provides a single value output representing whole location coordinates. It also correspond to the optimized output for the bus stop location in order to trigger the RF modules for location transmission through looping. Even though, some time it was observed that a fractional output value is obtained.

The R2 analysis results are tabulated in Table IV. The "Pred R-Squared" 0.97994 is in reasonable agreement with the "Adj R-Squared" of 0.977857. In fact, when the value of correlation coefficient R is close to 1, it means the response correlation of actual received coordinates and predicted values are better. The average accuracy from the R2 analysis is found out as 97.9%. The statistical analysis shows that, the developed mathematical model to predict the exact bus stop, based on central composite design is statistically adequate and can be used to trigger the slave module to start looping of transceiver for a single bus route.

The best fit line plot of the 33 points, Table 6 is found to be close to the ideal line (Y = X ). The predicted responses show the good agreement with actual results. The scatter shows the bus stop number representing casual position data from longitude and latitude can be predicted very precisely through RSM.

Predicted versus Actual plot  B. Validation  RSM results provided a good agreement between the received and trained coordinates in terms of single digit representing whole location data. The novel equation obtained, gave a simple functional dimension to train to the MCU. The subsequent step was to embed the equation got from RSM to the MCU. In order to validate the equation, it was   programmed to the MCU in such a way that all the constant and variable are taken as floating point. The necessary location coordinates are received in a pre-defined manner such that the selected digits can be utilized for the variables A, B, C and D mentioned in the equation 4.1. The equation constants are given names as PI, P2, P3, P4 and P5.

Field test: For the testing and equation validation purpose, the master module prototype was brought to the exact route of KL, from where the coordinates for training were collected (Table 1). The equation and modules gave expected results in the form of one digit representing the exact bus stop. During testing the master modules, the equation is programmed in MCU to get the output up to only one (01) digit after decimal number for conditioning and comparison. Later on the five digits (05) after decimals are taken as to verify the accuracy of the system. This selection is inspired by the same quantity of digits obtained by D OE using RSM (table 6). During testing, a little missing in obtaining the exact bus stop number was observed too. This might because of several circumstances including the slower 8 bit PIC, rounding off conditions, GPS multi path error or the number of 3 possibilities for each bus stop. The more possibilities, the more accuracy could obtain in the simulation results. Another reason is the unreliable floating point calculation. As mentioned in the PR OT ON BETA 7 manual.

Accuracy measure: The evidence is collected by programming the MCU to obtain the results of equation calculation step by step on the serial communicator provided by PIC kit 2 and also display at the LCD. The purpose is to reach at the error factor or in other words, the accuracy for the equation validation. Although there is a very slight difference found in the digits, (the reasons had been stated earlier) however these distinctions will not cast any effect on calculating the one digit value representing the bus stop number. This neglect-able error factor is also avoided by the help of conditioning of the output of the equation. For example for bus stop "01", the output of the equation by MCU "1.02" is conditioned to "1" The condition is applied by observing the maximum limit of the I digit after decimal.

Therefore, it can be interpreted that the accuracy measure check after testing the hardware for more than 8 digits based calculation have no error effect on overall functionality of the system. The table 7 below shows the overall calculation end results comparison through D OE and MCU for all 11 bus stops.

Table VI above shows a comparative analysis of end bus stop results after all calculation for all 11 observations. The remarkable results can be seen above. In the worst condition, it is observed a deviation of 9.76E-04 by calculation for bus stop number 01. Therefore, the overall results from D OE as well as MCU implies that the goal to achieve the target of obtaining single digit bus stop number representative of 17casual digits of location data was found to be capable efficient enough as compared to the D OE based simulation, since the required significant bits for conditioning is just one digit after decimal.

V. C ONCLUSION  This paper presents an approach that includes both the individual bus route optimization and the technological utilization to provide the public transport an implementable structure in the wider aspect. MM algorithm through RSM for better and reliable route's coordinate optimization brought remarkable performance evaluation to be used as wider public transport notification system in terms of data and time reduction. In case decision support system, the generic needs of the user, such as updated information with reliability are well documented in the literature and are subsequently reinforced in this study up to more enhancement. The design of the framework impacts the fruitful investment in long term to the companies operating the services. The model presented, illustrates several key stages which have to be taken into account by the transport planner. Anyhow, successful designing, its optimization and designed results matching, equation validation and testing directs a clear potential to bring the system in the leading solutions to resolve the overall public transport monitoring system for passengers. After testing prototype and modifications in the documentation for about half a year by taking extensive field test and surveys, the proposed framework tends to have potential for commanding public transit operations and lend a hand to change the trend of passengers to switch to use public transport instead of private own cars. And finally the reliable solution for the traffic congestion by providing facilitated bus stops to the travelers.
