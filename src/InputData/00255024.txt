Abstract In this paper a new encoding rule of fuzzy as-  sociative memories !FAMs) with the Max-Min composition units is presented. Under some con- dition, the proposed rule can efficiently encode  multiple fuzzy pattern pairs in a single FAM and perfect association of these pairs can be achieved.

The  correctness of the proposed rule is proved  and an illustrative example is given.

1 Introduction In recent years several models that combine  the strength of neural networks and fuzzy set the- ory have been developed and widely applied to  prospective fields such as fuzzy reasoning, pattern recognition, and fuzzy control"-". The FAM in-  troduced by Kosko, which involves the Max-Min  composition units, is one of the most useful and important paradigms"**'. Such a FAM is charac-  terized by the subset recall when trained using the  fuzzy Hebbian rule. The inability to reliably store  more than one pair is its essential drawback.

This leads us to seek for some algorithm to  overcome this drawback. Due to the nondifferen- tiability of the node functions, gradient descent  technique fails to  apply. Authors of this paper ev-  er suggested an iterative learning algorithm to en-  code multiple pairs in a FAM, which employs a so-called hill-climbing search strategy to  conduct  *This work is partly auppcrtd by National Natural Science  Foundaticn of China  connection weight  adjustment^'^). However, the algorithni is still a greedy method and possibly trapped a t  local minima of a defined cost function although satisfactory performence of the FAM is usually achieved. We propose here an alternative encoding rule that employs a suitable fuzzy logi- cal-implication operation different from the fuzzy  Hebbian rule. The proposed rule is capable of en- coding multiple pairs in the weight matrix of a FAM if there exists some weight matrix that properly forms the fuzzy relation between the in- put and output of the pairs.

A FAM is designed to store p-many fuzzy (u-  nit-interval valued ) pattern pairs (A , ,  B,) , , (A,,B,),where the kth pair is represented by the vectors Ab= (a:,**-,ai)and Bk= (b:,*-bi) respec- tively. The  topology of a FAM is shown in Figure  1.

Figure 1 :The topology of a FAM   0 1992 IEEE  7-    Singapore ICCSllSlTA '92  In the FAM with Max-Min composition u- nits, perfect association implies that the following equations should hold  A ~ o W  =& (k=1,2,..*,p) (1) where the symbol "0" denotes the Max-Min com- position operation. Intuitively, the weight matrix  W may be found using the equation  w =hwk t=l P  t-1 = n (At+Bk) (2)  where the symbol "+"denotes some implication operation, and " n" denotes a generalized super- imposition (e. g. ,maxima, minima etc). The in- termediate matrix w k  is used to record the logical conditional (At ,&>.

Kosko adopted a fuzzy Hebbian ( the mini- mum implication R.) rule pointwise to encode the kth pair (At ,  Bt ) in the Wt , then superimposed the matrices wks in a single matrix W by the maximum operation. In pointwise form, that is  w .  = O w !  " k = l  " P Rc  = V (a:+bt) k-1  = (a:A b:) (3) k = l  where the symbols " V " and " A " stand for the maximum and minimum operations respectively 9 and wiis are components of the W. when an input  pattern A is presented to the FAM ,a pattern B is recalled using the Max-Min composition  bi = V (ai Awi) ( 4 ) i - 1  From equation ( 4 )  ,we  notice that the re- called B is always a subset of the stored pattern  (,V wlr e- . ,  V wm) for arbitrary input pattern A.

Therefore, multiple pairs can not be reliably  stored in the FAM. An approach to overcoming  the problem is that a bank of FAMs is employed,  each of which seperately stores only one pair. But this results in consuming space of storage.

I= 1 i-1  (5)  3 The Proposed Encoding Rule As usual, we wish to distributively and reli-  ably store multiple fuzzy pattern pairs(Atr&) in  a single FAM such that each Bt can be perfectly recalled when each corresponding Ab is presented.

Instead of using the minimum implication R,, we associate here Bk with Ak using the implication  R,, and we also replace the maximum superimpo- sition by the minimum one as well. In this way,  we obtain the following encoding rule P  w = I \ w t  t= 1  P R.

= h (At+&)  In pointwise notation, that is k= 1  w! 1, = a'zbk 1 I  if a:>b: ={p: otherwise (6) P R I  w i  = A (a'+b:) (7) k = l  Obviously , the complexity of the proposed encoding rule is equivalent to that of the fuzzy  Hebbian rule used by Kosko.

As we know, there doesn' t always exist the  weight matrix of a FAM, which forms the appro-  priate fuzzy relation for arbitrary pairs of input  and output. In other words, these pairs have to  satisfy certain condition for the purpose of perfect  association . On the other hand, even if there ex- ists some desired weight matrix, the fuzzy Heb-  bian rule is not guaranteed to yield the desired  matrix, as shown (1,2). Based on analyzing the  condition for existence of desired weight matrix, we show below that the proposed encoding rule  can yield the desired matrix if it indeed exists.

Since the m units in the outut layer of the  FAM are independent one another ,we can con-  sider only one output unit. So the equation (1) is simply rewritten as   0 1992 IEEE  ~~~ -    Singapore ICCSASITA '92  K   We define the following sets and value  K = { 1 , 2 , - , p )  I ={1,2,- . ,n) Gij= {k E K I a!>b: ) Eij={kEKla'=b:) K..= G..

By definition, aL'<bf  or wj<mij<b:.

Hence we have  iE I  bf = ,V (aL' A w j ) BE I  = IJ (a$Awij)<by ilk 63,  This is obviously a contradiction .

Vice versa, assume that ,USij=K.

So, there exists a weight matrix W enabling  the equation (1) to hold, if and only if the equa- tion (16) holds for any j. The proposed rule ex- pressed by the equations (6) and (7) is in accor- dance with the equation (14) . From the proof of the above theorem, we can concluce that the pro-  posed rule can yield the desired weight matrix if it exists.

4 Example A set of fuzzy pattern pairs to be stored is  shown in Table 1, where n=6 ,m=2  and p=7. I t is easy to confirm that the equation (16) holds.

But the fuzzy Hibbian Rule produces the following matrix   0 1992 IEEE  T---    Singapore ICCS/ISITA ?92  r:; :: 0. 6 0. 6  w=lo.g 0.61 (18) With the matrix, the trained FAM can not per-  fectly recall these pairs.

Extensive simulation results show that the  proposed rule usually produce a smaller system error than does the iuzzy Hebbian rule, even if there doesn? t exist a desired weight matrix that enables the equation (1) to hold.

5 Conclusion A new encoding rule for multiple fuzzy pat-  tern pairs in FA.Ms with the Max-Min composi-  tion is presented. Under some condition, multiple pairs can be reliably encoded in a single FAM and perfect associations can be achieved. The correct-  ness of the proposed rule is demonstrated. Be- cause of the simple complexity ,the proposed rule may be much of use in the design of fuzzy systems where multiple rules need to be reliably stored.
