Association Rules Data Mining in Manufacturing Information System  based on Genetic Algorithms

Abstract In the process of the traditional association rule algorithm, because of the large frequent item set, the algorithm usually has very low efficiency. In this paper, the genetic algorithm is put into use to mining the association rules orienting to the data set in the Manufwturing Information System (MIS). A corresponding algorithm is also realized. According to the test result, a conclusion is drawn that the Genetic Algorithm has considerable higher efficiency.

Keywords Knowledge Discovery, Genetic Algorithm, Association Rule  I Introduction  The important meaning of Data Mining @M) and Knowledge Discovery in Database (KDD) are widely realized by more and more people. The nowadays methods have synthesized the outcome of the Database, Expert System, Schema recoption, Machine Learning and Statistics. Although ten years have passed after the time that KDD is put forward, the extensive and intensive application is in the developing stage. There are several DM software developed as  prototype, otherv+*ise, the efficiency and practice of the system cannot meet the detailed needs.

At present, Association Rule especially of Apriori Algorithm is comparatively reaching its maturity, but the low efficiency of this algorithm is a obstacle of its extensive application. Genetic Algorithm (GA) has been partly used in the area of schema identification; otherwise the research and usage in the area of MIS are at the beginning stage. By comparing with some property in the MIS data set, analyzing the data structure in the database, the application of Genetic Algorithm in MIS is proved to be a more efficient method. The purpose of this paper is to put the GA into use in the area of association rule mining, and to improve the efficiency of DM.

2 Application Analysis of Genetic Algorithm  There are three main operators in GA: selection, crossover and mutation. In order to put the GA into use, some analysis should be done. First, it should be tell apart about the individual, the population of individuals and  genes in the MIS database. The following step is to implement the Genetic Algorithm, and get the promising results.

In the process of data mining h t h e  MIS database, some of the history records could be looked as a population of indwiduals, a record as a corresponding individual, and the fields representing the property of the table could be looked as the genes, the correspondence of the items and a table is shown in figure 1 .

2. I Contrast with Traditional Search Algorithm  item set is increased, the quantity of 2-item set will increase radically. So this factor brings down the efficiency of the algorithm. On the other hand, GA is randomized parallel search algorithm that models natural selection, the process of evolution. Overtime, natural selection has produced a wide range of functions. The success of natural selection on earth provides an existence proof of the viability of an evolutionary process as a model for data mining. Like natural selection, GA is a robust search method with high efficiency. With each generation, part of the original history record set is a subset with a number of records Accordingly, the computation takes little time. As a result, the gene list reveals the association of the property.

Traditional search algorithm like Aprori, when its 1 -  2.2 Evaluating Evaluating a rule measures performance relative to  predetermined criteria. If the criteria are well defined, a scalar or vector value can be assigned to candidate rule and compared with others. In this paper, the evaluating criteria is relatively simple: to count the number of the record with the detailed properties, the percent of the counted number to the whole number of the history records, is the compatibility. If the value of the calculated compatibility is more than the minimal compatibility that predetermined by user, then, this rule turned out to be a valuable. After completing the iteration of generation, a result set representing the association rules will come out.

Figure 1. To illustrate the correspondence of  the item and a table  3 Computation p4cess of Genetic Algorithm in MIS  3. I Basic Genetic Algorithm  is divided into six steps: In this article, the application of GA in MIS database  A. Encode 3. Select the initial population of individuals, from  which computed the excellent gene list set Al; selectkg the second population of individuals, from which computed the excellent gene list set B1  C. Save the excellent gene list set above to result set R  D. Operate the mutation of A I  and B1, cross the gene of A I  and B1, and generate a new set A2, then select the third population of individuals, from which computed the excellent gene list set B2  E. Repeat the steps from b to c, until there is no new excellent gene Iist  F. Decode the result set R and generate the knowledge of association rules  3.2 System Encoding  The principles of encodmg are: the code is unique in the encoding set, if there are same values in two fields, the code of two value should encode respectively. If there are several same values in a field, all the same values should belong to a unique code. The following is to analyze all of situations and how to encoding:  The purpose of encoding is to simplify the operation.

A. The separated value should be encoded respectively, as shown in figure I ,  the field Cid can be encoded as the following: null+O, VINET31, TOMSP+2, HAN4R+3,  VICTE34, CHOPS35, ~ . .

B. The separated value of number should be encoded  all over again, the original value cannot be the code, as to the fieLd Eid shown in figure 1 is encoded as following: null+lO, 5+11, 6312,  4+13, 7+14, 5+ 1 1, . . . (the same values should have a correspondent same code, in the field Eid there are two same value 3, and the code is 1 I here)  C. The continuous values should be separated into several segments, and then encode the segments into system codes.

The filedfreight: nu113 SO, (&10)381, (10-20)+82, (2&30)383, (30-40)+84, _ _ _  value null should be appended, and encode it respectively, as is shown above.

E. The form of a example gene list might be ?1, 12, ...... , 80, ...... ?, the gene list consists of genes above.

D. With every filed should be encoded, an additional  3.3 Operator of selection, crossaver and mutation CA is randomized parallel search algorithm that  models natural selection. This method can ensure its homogeneous selection. User can decide the number of the population of individuals. When original population of individual is drawn out and encoded, the application wilI do selection. The further evaiuating process can decide which are excellent gene lists. The criteria of decision are the compatibilities mentioned abave. The compatibilities of the individuals can be computed in this application. To generate Structural Query Language (SQL) sentences are main operation in this process. The relations of operations are shown in figure 2.

Different users can config the system parameters by  themselves. Ordinarily the crossover rate is set between  0,001 and 0.1, andmutation rate between 0.001 and 0.005.

The generations of crossover are decided by the stability of  the result set R. The much number of genes increased, the  more time of computations takes, and the gznerations of  crossover and mutation will increase correspondingly.

m Result set R  ------..-  Figure 2. Relations of operations  3.4 Computation of CompatibiMy  list set? to ?Result Set R ?  is mainly the computation of compatibilities. In this paper, the compatibility is defined as foliows:  .4s shown in figure 2, the process of ?excetient gene  Compatibility = count / total-recordcount,  subject to count = the number of records with a  total-recordcount = the number of specific gene list  the whole records The user should predetermine the original  compatibility P,,,. If the computed camparibility is more than P,,,,, , then, the specific gene list can be looked as ?excellent gene list?, and will be saved in the result set R.

3.5 Description of the Algorithm In the practical prwess, user can select the table from  the database, and can also select the special fields that need to be analyzed. Then they should confirm some conditions or parameters like crosmver rate, mutation rate. The application can computed all the result possible and display it in a data grid as knowledg. The whole process of the GA can be described as foIlows:  input ( DBTable, hi-compatibility, mutationrate,  var new-rules; //new rules var rule-set; //rule set GetfieldcounQBTable); //fetch the number of the  Confirm_geneO; //confirm the gene list Encoding(); //gene encoding Do Begin  exchange-rate )  field:  Selectini_group(i); //selection Changejeneo; //crossover Judge(); //evaluating the compatibility If compatibility > hi-compatibility then  New-rules :=Generate-ruleO; //generate new  New-rules + rule-set; //append the new rule d e s  to the result set  new rules available  understandable  End While new-rules Q rule-set //the condition is no  Decoding(); //translate the solutions and make it  4 experimentation  In order to analyze the efficiency of GA-based association rules in MIS, a test is proceeded in a server computer: IBM Netfinity(Pentium 1G/512MRAM).

4.1 Comparison of time used between GA-based and  Apn'on' Algorithm The result of experiment in figure 3 shows that the  GA-based Association Rule is more efficient than Apriori Algorithm. The time used with the Apriori Algorithm increases sharply with the increase of data amount, otherwise, the other method takes less time. In this experiment, the original support and the original compntibilify are both set to 5%. The results vary with the specific databases.
