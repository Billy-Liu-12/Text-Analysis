Abstract - Due to the pressure from work load and daily life, there is an increase in geriatric depression population. However, some  people may not notice or have no idea about the symptom of  melancholia. More research input is needed to diagnose severity of  melancholia at an early stage. To help users diagnose their physical  fitness and mental health condition before outpatient service, two  approaches are considered in this paper. One is from responded  questionnaire. We apply data mining strategy to discover association  rules from responded questionnaire, including geriatric depression,  BAI, ASRM, and PSQI. The other is from user's recorded daily  emotion. We devise user interfaces on smart phones for users to  record their daily emotion. The proposed system can extract the  association rules among negative emotion and help users understand  their emotional variations. The discovered association rules can  provide valuable information for psychiatrists to make more accurate  diagnosis before outpatient service. To obtain informative analytical  results, multitudes of simulations are performed on 2,500 data stored in our database. Simulation results under different combinations of  score level, minimum support and minimum confidence are given for  comparisons and to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the  proposed system.

Keywords: Geriatric Depression, Physical Fitness and Mental Health, Association Rules, Data Mining.



I. INTRODUCTION  According to a recent report by WHO (World Health Organization) three diseases that are in dire need of scientific breakthroughs by 2020 are cardiovascular disease, melancholia and AIDS. Melancholia is a serious and common but under estimated psychiatry. With the continuing improvement of medical care, the average human life span extends but living longer does not imply living happy.

Another research report from Harvard University indicates that the second global burden of disease is melancholia.

Melancholia has the symptoms of early occurrence, continuance, and re-occurrence. Even worse, there are 15% of melancholia patients will commit suicide finally.

Smart phones have become more widespread and a recent survey indicates that their market share will be 31 % by 2013. This is one of the reasons why a mobile cloud computing system for health care is considered in this paper.

We intend to design user friendly interfaces on smart phones for users to answer health care questionnaire.

Data mining technology can be applied to extract association rules among large item sets from transactional databases. However, certain outliers and rare or unexpected items are completely removed from succeeding association analysis in the early stage due to the pre-defined minimum support threshold. In medical care applications, however, the unexpected symptoms or patient's behaviors may play very   Shen-Ing Liu, Hui-Chun Huang Department of Psychiatry, Department of Medical Research  Mackay Memorial Hospital  Taipei, Taiwan 10449  critical role in outpatient service. Thus, instead of just digging out commonly occurred patterns a novel association rule mining algorithm is proposed to effectively extract the associations among outliers from medical records.

Both pre-diagnosis and continuing treatment/tracking of melancholia is indispensable for patients in health care. Patient's negative emotion and behaviors will be transformed to transactional records so that their relationships to melancholia can be mined and to provide references for psychiatrists to guide patient's self care. A speech emotion variation database is created based on patients' self recording of emotions that are uploaded from patients' smart phones. The behavior events are used to find their associations with negative emotions.

This paper is organized as follows. The related work to the proposed system is described in section 2. Section 3 illustrates the procedures to find association rules from responded questionnaire.

Section 4 gives the experimental results. Conclusions and future work are made in the final section 5.



II. RELATED WORK  The proposed system includes the mobile phone platform, computer platform and cloud computing platform.

There are three modules devised for the mobile phone platform: (1) voice recognition, (2) medical enquiry, and (3) leisure and amusement. The two modules in the computer platform are: (1) uploading ECG and environmental monitoring signals from ZigBee to cloud center, and (2) data mining. The three modules in the cloud computing platform consist of: (1) physical fitness and mental health evaluation, (2) word segmentation, and (3) ECG and environmental monitoring. The following describes some of the related technology used in the designed modules.

Users can record their daily emotion by smart phones for geriatric depression evaluation. We applied Google voice recognition functional module to transform users' speeches into text files and then upload them to the cloud center. The text files are further processed by CKIP system that is developed by Academia Sinica, Taiwan to segment the keywords. Then, FP-tree (Frequent Patterns tree) and FP-growth (Frequent Patterns growth) algorithms are used to discover the interesting association rules from users' negative emotion.

For users to self evaluate their depression degree a physical fitness and mental health evaluation system is developed. This system provides geriatric depression, BAI, ASRM and PSQI questionnaire for users to answer. Users can respond the questionnaire either from their smart phones or from the computers in the waiting room before outpatient    service. In the past, questionnaire was answered by pen on the papers. This design can provide psychiatrists instant and valuable information before outpatient service. The evaluation scores as well as the responded questionnaire were further analyzed by the proposed data mining technique. Fig.

1 is the diagram showing how a user self diagnoses the depression degree.

III. FINDING ASSOCIATION RULES FROM MEDICAL DATABASES  Discovering association rules from large transactional databases were fIrst proposed by Agrawal et. al. [5].

Following the pioneering work, diverse mining algorithms and applications have been developed [6-18], including the well-known Apriori algorithm. FP-tree algorithm was fIrst proposed by Han et. al. [12]. Most algorithms in discovering association rules were based on generating large item sets. To reduce the execution time FP-tree finds interesting association rules without repeatedly generating candidate item sets. This overcomes the drawback of well-known Apriori algorithm that takes much time in repeatedly scanning the databases to generate large item sets [1,2]. Fig. 2 is an example showing the procedures how a FP-tree is constructed.

3.1 Constructing a FP-tree The underlying procedures to construct a FP-tree are  based on the melancholia evaluation example given in Fig. 2.

The underlying procedures are directly applicable to the analyses of BAI, ASRM and PSQI questionnaire.

There are nine questions in the melancholia questionnaire. Each question uses 4 scales, i.e., 0 to 3 points, to reflect the degree conforming to the question. Currently,   the questionnaire is answered by pen on papers that make them tedious for statistical analysis. The proposed system is designed to automate the process. Any responded questionnaire is stored in the back-end server for instant analysis.

To fmd the aSSOCiatIOn rules among answers from different respondents, each answer is relabeled as ij where i is the question numbering from 1 to 9 and j ranges from English alphabets A to D corresponding to scales 0 to 3. For example, a responded questionnaire after transformation may look like the pattern: {IA,2B,3D,4C,5B,6C,7D,8B,9A}. The upper part of Fig. 2 shows an example how the ordered frequent items are found from fIve responded questionnaires and the lower part is the complete FP-tree from the questionnaires. The following describes the procedures to construct a FP-tree.

Step 1: Scanning the transactional database to find out large  l-itemset Ll that has a support value greater than or equal to the minimum support. If the minimum support is 3, then the l-itemset Ll from Fig. 2 is {2b,3d,5c,6b,7c,9b}.

Step 2: According to the support values sorting the large  l-itemset Ll in descending order. From Fig. 2 we have {(5c:4),(9b:4),(2b:3),(3d:3),(7c:3),(6b:3)}. Note that each item (e.g., 5c) is followed by a colon (:) and a fIgure (e.g., 4) such as 5c:4 in the tree structure. The fIgure represents the support value for that item in the database.

Step 3: Following step 2 to reorder each transaction in the original database to create a virtual database with ordered frequent items. A root node is created to construct the FP-tree.

Step 4: The ordered frequent items are sequentially added to the FP-tree. Whenever trying to add a new transaction to the current FP-tree, the existing paths are checked. If the prefIx of the transaction matched an existing path, then the counter of each node in the path is incremented by 1; otherwise, a new branch is created for the suffix of the transaction. The process continues until all transactions have been added to the FP-tree.

3.2 FP-Growth Algorithm FP-Growth algorithm is adopted to extract every  frequent item set from the FP-tree. FP-Growth algorithm searches the frequent item sets by reversing the order of large  1-itemset Ll . In Fig. 2, the one with the smallest support  value, 6b, in Ll is initiated to find frequent itemsets, followed by the second smallest, 7c, and so on. The process is continued until the most frequent item is joined to find frequent itemsets. The following summarizes the procedures to find the frequent item sets [3,4].

Step 1: Find all frequent itemsets that include the one with the  least frequency in L1. Based on the header table in FP-structure it is found that the frequency of 6b is 3 that suffices for a frequent item. Besides, from the root to the node 6b there are three different paths, including <5c:4, 9b:4, 6b: 1>, <5c:4, 9b:4, 2b:3, 6b: 1> and <5c:4, 9b:4, 2b:3, 3d:2, 7c:2, 6b: 1>. The FP-tree constructed from the prefix node 6b is termed the 6b's conditional FP-tree. Then, we can fmd the conditional FP-tree for the least frequent item. From the three paths both {5c, 9b} have frequencies 3 that overpass the minimum support. Thus, under the prerequisite of 6b the frequent items include {5c, 6b}, {5c, 9b, 6b}, and {9b, 6b}.

Step 2: Find all frequent itemsets that comprise the one with the second smallest support value, 7c, in Ll . There are two paths to traverse from the root node to node 7c, including <5c:4, 9b:4, 2b:3, 3d:2, 7c:2> and <3d: 1, 7c: 1>. There is no need to consider the effect of 6b as it is already counted in the previous step. Then, the prefixes of item 7c include <5c:2, 9b:2, 2b:2, 3d:2> and <3d:l>. In the conditional FP-tree for 7c only item 3d has a support value larger than or equal to the minimum support 3. As a result, the frequent itemset under the condition of7c is {3d, 7c}.

Step 3: Find all frequent itemsets that comprise the one with the third smallest support value, 3d, but excluding both 7c  and 6b in Ll . The prefix of item 3d includes the only path <5c:2, 9b:2, 2b:2> that has no item with frequency greater than the minimum support 3. As a result, there is no frequent item set for 3d.

Step 4: The prefix of item 2b includes the only path <5c:3, 9b:3> that has both items with frequency greater than the minimum support 3. The frequent itemset consists of {5c,2b}, {5c,9b,2b} and {9b,2b}.

Step 5: As for the item 9b, the only path is <5c:4>. The frequent item set is {5c,9b}.

Step 6: Because no lateral links for item 5c there is no need to fmd frequent itemset.

Step 7: The process is continued until all items have been used to find frequent itemsets.



IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND ANALYSES  To diagnose the degree of geriatric depression several modules were devised in the Android platform mobile phones.

Physical fitness and mental health evaluation module: This module includes geriatric depression, BAI, ASRM and PSQI questionnaire as shown in Fig. 3(a). Fig. 3(b) lists part of the evaluation questions for geriatric depression. Currently, we   have only the Chinese version. The evaluation score from the responded questionnaire is shown in Fig. 4(a). Articles related to geriatric depression can be hyper linked from the webpage as shown in Fig. 4(b).

Word segmentation module: User friendly interfaces are designed on mobile phones for users to self record their own mood and then upload them to the back-end server for analyzing their depression degrees. The analyzed result will be sent as a short message to the user's mobile phone as shown in Fig. 5(a). The variations of depression degrees are plotted in Fig. 5(b) for users self monitoring.

Data mining module: In our experiments, the responded total scores are further divided into 5 grade levels, including good condition (scores 0-4), a little bothersome emotion (scores 5-9), slight melancholia symptom (scores 10-14), medium melancholia symptom (scores 15-19), and heavy melancholia symptom (scores 20 and up).

To realize how users responded to the questionnaire, data mining technology is applied to fmd the association rules among the answers based on combinations of grade intervals, mmllllum supports, and mmllllum confidences. The procedures to fmd the association rules are given in Fig. 6.

The purpose to extract the association rules among multitudes of answers is to provide useful information for psychiatrists to understand whether most users have similar physical fitness and mental health reactions under geriatric depression.

In this study, we use FP-tree and FP-Growth algorithms to find the association rules from answered questionnaire. Some of the experimental results are shown in Fig. 7.

Based on the combinations of different grade levels and preset minimum support and confidence values, multitudes of simulations were performed for analyses. To obtain informative analytical results, each score level has 500 randomly generated data and a total of 2,500 data are stored in our database. Simulations under the combinations of minimum support of 2%, 3%, 4%, 5% and minimum confidence of 40%, 45%, 50% were performed for comparisons.

According to the simulation results, it is hard to fmd the common association rules from those five melancholia levels.

Three other case studies are considered instead.

Case 1: The frequent itemsets appeared at least 3 times under the same minimum support and confidence at different levels.

In this case, the frequent item sets only appeared at score levels of (0-4), (5-9), and (10-14) under the minimum support of 2%, 3%, 4% and minimum confidence of 40%. Two of the association rules are listed below for illustration.

Rule 1: {2C,6A} It means "over half' of the symptom that users cannot eat or over eat implies that they "not at all" do things without interest or fun.

Rule 2: {4C,6A} It means "over half' of the symptom that users cannot concentrate on things (for example, reading newspaper or watching TV) implies that they "not at all" do things without interest or fun.

Case 2: The frequent item sets appeared at least 2 times at the slight to heavy score levels of (10-14), (15-19), and (20 and up) under the minimum support of 2%, 3%, 4%, 5% and minimum confidence of 45%. Three of the association rules are listed below for illustration.

Rule 1: {4B,5D}  It means that the patients "sometimes" cannot concentrate on things (for example, reading newspaper or watching TV) implies that they "almost every day" react things or speak slowly or are apparently fidgety than before.

Rule 2: {6B,8D} It means the patients "sometimes" do things without interest or fun implies that they "almost every day" feel not good enough (for example, feel themselves failure, sorrow or shame).

Rule 3: {1B,8D}  It means the patients "sometimes" have sleeping problems (for example, cannot fall asleep, easy to wake up, or oversleep) implies that they "almost every day" feel not good enough (for example, feel themselves failure, sorrow or shame).

Case 3: The frequent itemsets at the slight to medium score levels of (10-14) and (15-19) only appeared under the conditions of minimum support of 2% and minimum confidence of 40%. Two of the association rules are listed below for illustration.

Rule 1: {3A,6C,7C} It means the patients "not at all" feel tired or no energy and "over the half' do things without interest or fun implies that they "over the half' have melancholia symptom (for example, feel upset, depressed or despair).

Rule 2: {3B,4C,8C} It means the patients "sometimes" feel tired or no energy and "over the half' cannot concentrate on things (for example, reading newspaper or watching TV) implies that they "over the half' feel not good enough (for example, feel themselves failure, sorrow or shame).

Electrocardiogram (ECG) and environmental monitoring module: This module is to integrate EeG, ambient temperature, humidity, brightness and infra-red intensity information into the cloud webpage. User emotion will affect their heartbeat rates. After attaching RA (right arm), LA (left arm), and RL (right leg) monitoring electros to the left chest, the proposed system can receive the EeG signals from BigBee. Fig. 8 shows the webpage displaying EeG and environmental monitoring information on mobile phones. The analyzed results from user's different exercises are listed in Table 1 for comparisons. The results are analyzed from receiving 2,000 packets of EeG signals. The measurement was repeated three times with an interval of 5 minutes for sitting, standing and walking modes while the interval was 10 minutes for climbing stairs.

V. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK  To help users self diagnose their physical fitness and mental health conditions some user friendly interfaces were devised on the smart phones. Users can use mobile phones or personal computers with touch screens to answer questionnaire such as geriatric depression, BAI, ASRM and PSQI. This system is deployed in the waiting rooms for patients to answer the diagnosis questionnaire before outpatient services. The responded questionnaire can be instantly analyzed to realize the degree of geriatric depression. The evaluation results can provide valuable information for psychiatrists to make more accurate diagnosis on patients' melancholia degrees. We also propose to  apply data mining technique to discover the association rules among responded questionnaire and users' negative emotion words. Experimental results verified that the proposed system is suitable for analyzing the associations among users' responded questionnaire and their negative emotion.

Future work will focus on collecting more questionnaire samples from users so that better association rules can be found.

The word segmentation module needs further adjustment to segment the texts transformed from speeches more accurate.
