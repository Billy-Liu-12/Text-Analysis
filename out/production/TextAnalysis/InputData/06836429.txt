The Spacecraft Signal Correlation Approach in China's  Delta-DOR Correlator for Chang'E-3 Mission

Abstract-Delta-DOR is a powerful radiometric navigation  technique in the lunar and deep space exploration. With the  deployment of Kashi 35m and Jiamusi 66m antennas, China  has the capability to make Delta-DOR measurements for the  missions exploring the moon and beyond. This paper has  introduced the Delta-DOR system in Chinese deep space  TT &C network, including the correlator. Basics of Delta-DOR  have been reviewed, and the correlation algorithm to minimize  the receiver thermal noise effects and cancel out the signal  dynamic contribution has been discussed theoretically in  details. Simulations have been made to show that the DOR  measurements could be achieved with accuracy of 0.3ns for the  Chang'E-3 power descent phase. Besides, preliminary test to  validate the potential capability of the correlator to deal with  the case of weak signal tracking as low as IdB-Hz has been  made using raw data ofESA' s Venus Express.
