Abstract?The observations of some samples from the popula- tion of a probability density function with unknown parameters are usually imprecise due to various reasons. By employing uncertain variables to model these imprecise observations, this paper proposes an interdiscipline called uncertain statistical in- ference, which is composed of statistical inference and uncertainty theory. It presents three types of statistic inference problems with imprecise observations which are the point estimation, the hypothesis test and the interval estimation. Then it proposes a method of moments and a method of likelihood function (maximum likelihood estimation) for the first problem, and a method of likelihood ratio function for the other two problems.

I. INTRODUCTION  IN the statistical inference problems, it is commonly as-sumed that the samples are precisely observed and denoted by crisp numbers. For example, given a probability density dis- tribution f(x|?) with unknown parameter ?, we are usually as- sumed to have precise observations of some samples from the population, which we denote by real numbers x1, x2, ? ? ? , xn.

Based on these crisp numbers, we process some statistical inferences on the parameter ? such as the point estimation, the hypothesis test and the interval estimation. However, due to the human uncertainty during the process of observing the samples, the observations are often not precise enough, and they cannot be described via crisp numbers. As a result, the traditional inference models fail to deal with the problems with imprecise observations, which motivates us to generalize the statistical inference models with the help of a new tool called uncertainty theory.

As a branch of mathematics for modelling human uncertain- ty, the uncertainty theory was founded by Liu [1] in 2007 and refined by Liu [2] in 2009. In order to indicate human?s belief degree on the chance that each event occurs, Liu [1] proposed a concept of uncertain measure which is a set function on a ?- algebra. Then the uncertain variable, as a measurable function on an uncertainty space, was proposed as a tool to model a quantity with human uncertainty. In practice, the uncertain variable is mainly described by its uncertainty distribution.

supplements, numerical characteristics such as the expected value, the variance and the entropy are also employed to describe uncertain variables.

In this paper, we characterize the imprecise observations via uncertain variables, and propose the uncertain statistic infer- ence which is an interdisciplinary subject of uncertainty theory and statistical inference. Some related inference problems such as the point estimation, the hypothesis test, and the interval estimation are investigated. The rest of this paper is structured as follows. In the next section, we review some relevant literature. Then some basic concepts about uncertain variables are introduced in Section 3. After that, some methods for solving the problems of point estimation, hypothesis test and interval estimation with imprecise observations are presented in Sections 4-6, respectively. Finally, some remarks are made in Section 7.



II. LITERATURE REVIEW  Uncertainty theory is a branch of mathematics for modelling human uncertainty. In 2007, Liu [1] first proposed a concept of uncertain measure which is a set function satisfying normal- ity, duality and subadditivity on a ?-algebra. Different from probability measure, the uncertain measure is not necessarily continuous. Gao [3] investigated the properties of continuous uncertain measures. As a measurable function on the uncer- tainty space, the uncertain variable is used to model a quantity with human uncertainty. The uncertainty distribution is the main tool to describe an uncertain variable in practice. Peng and Iwamura [4] proved a sufficient and necessary condition for a real function being an uncertainty distribution. Liu [5] provided a formula to calculate the uncertainty distribution of a function of uncertain variables, which is often called the operational law of uncertain variables.

The expected value of an uncertain variable is essentially the average of the uncertain variable in the sense of uncertain measure. Liu [5] verified the linearity of the expected value operator for independent uncertain variables. Liu and Ha [6] gave a formula to calculate the expected value of a function of uncertain variables. The variance measures the spread of an uncertain variable around its expected value. Yao [7] provided a formula to calculate the variance of an uncertain variable.

As the generalizations of expected value and variance, the moments of uncertain variables were studied Liu [8] and Sheng and Kar [9].

The entropy characterizes the uncertainty (or the informa- tion) of an uncertain variable. Dai and Chen [10] proved the positive linearity of the entropy operator, and Chen and Dai [11] discussed the maximum entropy principle of uncer- tain variables. The convergence of a sequence of uncertain    1063-6706 (c) 2016 IEEE. Personal use is permitted, but republication/redistribution requires IEEE permission.

Nowadays, uncertainty theory has been applied to many areas, bringing about many interdisciplines such as uncertain programming (Liu [14]), uncertain risk analysis (Liu [15]), uncertain logic (Li and Liu [16]), uncertain process (Yao and Li [17]), and uncertain game (Yang and Gao [18]).



III. PRELIMINARIES  Definition 1. (Liu [1]) Let L be a ?-algebra on a nonempty set ?. A set function M : L ? [0, 1] is called an uncertain measure if it satisfies the following axioms: Axiom 1: (Normality Axiom) M{?} = 1 for the universal set ?.

Axiom 2: (Duality Axiom) M{?}+M{?c} = 1 for any event ?.

Axiom 3: (Subadditivity Axiom) For every countable sequence of events ?1,?2, ? ? ? , we have  M  {  ? ?  i=1  ?i  }  ? ? ?  i=1  M {?i} .

In this case, the triple (?,L,M) is called an uncertainty space.

The product uncertain measure on the product ?-algebra of the uncertainty spaces was defined by Liu [2], producing the fourth axiom of uncertain measure.

Axiom 4: (Product Axiom) Let (?k,Lk,Mk) be uncertainty spaces for k = 1, 2, ? ? ? Then the product uncertain measure M is an uncertain measure satisfying  M  {  ? ?  k=1  ?k  }  =  ? ?  k=1  Mk{?k}  where ?k are arbitrarily chosen events from Lk for k = 1, 2, ? ? ? , respectively.

Definition 2. (Liu [1]) An uncertain variable ? is a function from the uncertainty space (?,L,M) to the set of real numbers such that the set  {? ? B} = {? ? ?|?(?) ? B}  is an event for any Borel set B of real numbers.

Definition 3. (Liu [1]) The uncertainty distribution of an uncertain variable ? is defined by  ?(x) = M{? ? x}  for any real number x.

An uncertainty distribution ? is called regular if its inverse function ??1 exists. In this case, the inverse function ??1 is called an inverse uncertainty distribution.

Definition 4. (Liu [2]) The uncertain variables ?1, ?2, ? ? ? , ?n are said to be independent if  M  {  n ?  i=1  (?i ? Bi) }  =  n ?  i=1  M {?i ? Bi} (1)  for any Borel sets B1, B2, ? ? ? , Bn of real numbers.

Assume that ?1, ?2, ? ? ? , ?n are independent uncertain vari- ables with regular uncertainty distributions ?1,?2, ? ? ? ,?n, respectively. If the function f(x1, x2, ? ? ? , xn) is strictly in- creasing with respect to x1, x2, ? ? ? , xm and strictly decreas- ing with respect to xm+1, xm+2, ? ? ? , xn, then the uncertain variable  ? = f(?1, ?2, ? ? ? , ?n)  has an uncertainty distribution  ?(x) = sup f(x1,x2,??? ,xn)?x  (  min 1?i?m  ?i(xi) ? min m+1?i?n  (1? ?i(xi)) )  and an inverse uncertainty distribution  ??1(?) = f (  ??11 (?), ? ? ? ,??1m (?),  ??1m+1(1? ?), ? ? ? ,??1n (1? ?) )  .

Definition 5. (Liu [1]) The expected value of an uncertain variable ? is defined by  E[?] =  ? +?   M{? ? x}dx? ? 0  ??  M{? ? x}dx  provided that at least one of the two integrals is finite. And the expected value E[?k] is called the kth moment of the uncertain variable ?.

Let ? be an uncertain variable with an uncertainty distribu- tion ?. If its kth moment E[?k] exists, then  E[?k] =  ? +?  ??  xkd?(x).

Furthermore, if ? is regular, then  E[?] =  ? 1   ??1(?)d?.



IV. POINT ESTIMATION  This section intends to introduce the method of moments and the method of maximum likelihood estimation for the point estimation problems when the observation data are not crisp numbers but uncertain variables.

A. Method of Moments  Let uncertain variables ?1, ?2, ? ? ? , ?n denote the imprecise observations of some samples from the population with a probability density distribution f(x|?1, ?2, ? ? ? , ?p). On the one hand, we could calculate the kth sample moment  E  [   n  n ?  i=1  ?ki  ]  of the imprecise observations. On the other hand, we could calculate the kth population moment  ? +?  ??  xkf(x|?1, ?2, ? ? ? , ?p)dx    1063-6706 (c) 2016 IEEE.

The method of moments finds the estimates of the unknown parameters ?1, ?2, ? ? ? , ?p by equating the first p population moments to the first p sample moments ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ? +?  ??  xf(x|?1, ?2, ? ? ? , ?p)dx = E [   n  n ?  i=1  ?i  ]  ? +?  ??  x2f(x|?1, ?2, ? ? ? , ?p)dx = E [   n  n ?  i=1  ?2i  ]  ...

? +?  ??  xpf(x|?1, ?2, ? ? ? , ?p)dx = E [   n  n ?  i=1  ?pi  ]  ,  (2)  and solving the system (2) of equations. Let ?1(x),?2(x), ? ? ? ,?n(x) denote the uncertainty distributions of ?1, ?2, ? ? ? , ?n, respectively. Then the system (2) can be transformed into the system ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ? +?  ??  xf(x|?1, ?2, ? ? ? , ?p)dx =  n  n ?  i=1  ? +?  ??  xd?i(x)  ? +?  ??  x2f(x|?1, ?2, ? ? ? , ?p)dx =  n  n ?  i=1  ? +?  ??  x2d?i(x)  ...

? +?  ??  xpf(x|?1, ?2, ? ? ? , ?p)dx =  n  n ?  i=1  ? +?  ??  xkd?i(x).

(3)  Example 1. Assume there are only n imprecise observations denoted by ?1, ?2, ? ? ? , ?n available for us to estimate the unknown parameters a and b of a uniform distribution  f(x|a, b) =  ?  ?  ?   b? a , if a ? x ? b 0, otherwise.

Please note that the first moment (expected value) and the second moment of the uniform distribution f(x|a, b) are (a+ b)/2 and (a2 + ab+ b2)/3, respectively. Then by the method of moments, we can estimate the values of the parameters a and b by solving the system of equations  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  a+ b  =   n  n ?  i=1  ? +?  ??  xd?i(x)  a2 + ab+ b2  =   n  n ?  i=1  ? +?  ??  x2d?i(x).

Example 2. Assume there are only n imprecise observations denoted by ?1, ?2, ? ? ? , ?n available for us to estimate the unknown parameter ? of an exponential distribution  f(x|?) = 1 ? exp  (  ?x ?  )  , x ? 0.

Please note that the first moment (expected value) of the exponential distribution f(x|?) is ?. Then by the method of moments, the estimate of the parameter ? is  ? =  n  n ?  i=1  ? +?  ??  xd?i(x).

Example 3. Assume there are only n imprecise observations denoted by ?1, ?2, ? ? ? , ?n available for us to estimate the unknown parameters ? and ? of a normal distribution  f(x|?, ?) = 1? 2??  exp  (  ? (x? ?)  2?2  )  .

Please note that the first moment (expected value) and the second moment of the normal distribution f(x|?, ?) are ? and ?2 + ?2, respectively. Then by the method of moments, we can estimate the values of the parameters ? and ? by solving the system of equations  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ? =  n  n ?  i=1  ? +?  ??  xd?i(x)  ?2 + ?2 =  n  n ?  i=1  ? +?  ??  x2d?i(x).

B. Maximum Likelihood Estimation  Let uncertain variables ?1, ?2, ? ? ? , ?n denote the imprecise observations of the samples from the population with a prob- ability density distribution f(x|?1, ?2, ? ? ? , ?p). The likelihood function is defined by  L(?1, ?2, ? ? ? , ?p|?1, ?2, ? ? ? , ?n) = n ?  i=1  f(?i|?1, ?2, ? ? ? , ?p),  and the maximum likelihood estimates of the unknown param- eters ?1, ?2, ? ? ? , ?p are the optimal solution of the optimization problem  max (?1,?2,??? ,?p)  E[L(?1, ?2, ? ? ? , ?p|?1, ?2, ? ? ? , ?n)]  =E  [  n ?  i=1  f(?i|?1, ?2, ? ? ? , ?p) ]  .

Example 4. Assume there are only n imprecise observations denoted by ?1, ?2, ? ? ? , ?n available for us to estimate the unknown parameters a and b of a uniform distribution  f(x|a, b) =  ?  ?  ?   b? a, if a ? x ? b 0, otherwise.

Let ?i denote the uncertainty distributions of ?i for i = 1, 2, ? ? ? , n. Then we have an approximation  E  [  n ?  i=1  f(?i|a, b) ]  =  (b ? a)n (  min 1?i?n  ?i(b)? max 1?i?n  ?i(a)  )  .

By the method of maximum likelihood estimation, we can estimate the values of the parameters a and b by solving the optimization problem  max a,b   (b ? a)n (  min 1?i?n  ?i(b)? max 1?i?n  ?i(a)  )  .

Example 5. Assume there are only n imprecise observations denoted by ?1, ?2, ? ? ? , ?n available for us to estimate the unknown parameter ? of an exponential distribution  f(x|?) = 1 ? exp  (  ?x ?  )  , x ? 0.

Then we have  E  [  n ?  i=1  f(?i|?) ]  =  ?n E  [  exp  (  ? 1 ? ?  n ?  i=1  ?i  )]  =  ?n  ? 1   exp  (  ? 1 ? ?  n ?  i=1  ??1i (?)  )  d?.

V. HYPOTHESIS TEST  Consider a probability density distribution f(x|?1, ?2, ? ? ? , ?p) with unknown parameters ?1, ?2, ? ? ? , ?p. A hypothesis is a statement about the parameters, and a hypothesis test gives a rule that specifies whether the hypothesis should be rejected or not based on the values of the samples. This section introduces a method of likelihood ratio test to find some appropriate rules of the hypothesis test when the observations of the samples are imprecise and modeled by uncertain variables.

For simplicity, we write ? = (?1, ?2, ? ? ? , ?p) and ? = (?1, ?2, ? ? ? , ?n) in this section, and denote by ? the set of all possible values of ?. Then a hypothesis about ? can be expressed by H0: ? ? ?0 (which is usually called null hypothesis) versus H1: ? ? ?c0 (which is usually called alternative hypothesis), where ?0 is some subset of ?. The likelihood ratio test statistic for testing H0: ? ? ?0 versus H1: ? ? ?c0 is  LRT =  sup ???0  L(?|?)  sup ???  L(?|?) ,  and the method of likelihood ratio test says the null hypothesis H0: ? ? ?0 is rejected if  M  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  sup ???0  L(?|?)  sup ???  L(?|?) ? c  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ? ?  where c ? (0, 1) is some number to be selected based on the probability density function f , the sample size n and the effectiveness level ? of the test, and ? ? [0, 1] is the credibility level.

Example 6. Assume ?1, ?2, ? ? ? , ?n are some imprecise obser- vations from a population with an exponential distribution  f(x|?) = {  exp(?x+ ?), if x ? ? 0, otherwise.

Consider testing H0: ? ? ?0 versus H1: ? > ?0, where ?0 is a number fixed by some experimenter. The likelihood function  is  L(?|?) =  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  exp  (  ? n ?  i=1  ?i + n?  )  , if ? ? min 1?i?n  ?i  0, otherwise.

Then  sup ???0  L(?|?) =  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  exp  (  ? n ?  i=1  ?i + n?0  )  ,  if ?0 ? min 1?i?n  ?i  exp  (  ? n ?  i=1  ?i + n ? min 1?i?n  ?i  )  ,  otherwise  and  sup ???  L(?|?) = exp (  ? n ?  i=1  ?i + n ? min 1?i?n  ?i  )  .

So we have  LRT =  sup ???0  L(?|?)  sup ???  L(?|?)  =  ?  ?  ?  exp  (  n?0 ? n ? min 1?i?n  ?i  )  , if ?0 ? min 1?i?n  ?i  1, otherwise,  and  M  ?  ?  ?  sup ???0  L(?|?)  sup ???  L(?|?) ? c  ?  ?  ?  =M  {  exp  (  n?0 ? n ? min 1?i?n  ?i  )  ? c }  =M  {  min 1?i?n  ?i ? ?0 ? ln c  n  }  .

By the method of likelihood ratio test, the hypothesis H0: ? ? ?0 should be rejected if  M  {  min 1?i?n  ?i ? ?0 ? ln c  n  }  ? ?.

Furthermore, let ?1,?2, ? ? ? ,?n denote the uncertainty dis- tributions of ?1, ?2, ? ? ? , ?n, respectively. Then the hypothesis H0: ? ? ?0 should be rejected if  max 1?i?n  ?i  (  ?0 ? ln c  n  )  ? 1? ?.

Example 7. Assume ?1, ?2, ? ? ? , ?n are some imprecise obser- vations from a population with a normal distribution  f(x|?) = 1? 2?  exp  (  ? (x? ?)   )  .

Consider testing H0: ? = ?0 versus H1: ? 6= ?0, where ?0 is a number fixed by some experimenter. Note that the likelihood    1063-6706 (c) 2016 IEEE.

Citation information: DOI 10.1109/TFUZZ.2017.2666846, IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems  TFS-2016-0612.R2 5  function is  L(?|?) = n ?  i=1  1? 2?  exp  (  ? (?i ? ?)   )  =  (2?)n/2 exp  (  ?1  n ?  i=1  (?i ? ?)2 )  .

Then  L(?0|?) =  (2?)n/2 exp  (  ?1  n ?  i=1  (?i ? ?0)2 )  and  sup ???  L(?|?) = sup ???   (2?)n/2 exp  (  ?1  n ?  i=1  (?i ? ?)2 )  =  (2?)n/2 exp  ?  ??1  n ?  i=1  (  ?i ?  n  n ?  i=1  ?i  )2 ?  ? .

So we have  LRT = L(?0|?)  sup ???  L(?|?)  = exp  ?  ?    n ?  i=1  (  ?i ?  n  n ?  i=1  ?i  )2  ? 1  n ?  i=1  (?i ? ?0)2 ?  ?  = exp  ?  ??n  n ?  i=1  (   n  n ?  i=1  ?i ? ?0 )2 ?  ? ,  and  M  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  L(?0|?) sup ???  L(?|?) ? c  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  =M  ?  ?  ?  exp  ?  ??n  n ?  i=1  (   n  n ?  i=1  ?i ? ?0 )2 ?  ? ? c  ?  ?  ?  =M  {?  ?  ?  ?  ?   n  n ?  i=1  ?i ? ?0  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ? ?  ?2 ln c n  }  .

By the method of likelihood ratio test, the hypothesis H0: ? = ?0 should be rejected if  M  {?  ?  ?  ?  ?   n  n ?  i=1  ?i ? ?0  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ? ?  ?2 ln c n  }  ? ?. (4)  Furthermore, assume ?1, ?2, ? ? ? , ?n have regular uncertainty distributions ?1,?2, ? ? ? ,?n, respectively. Then the hypothe- sis H0: ? = ?0 should be rejected if  ?0 ?  n  n ?  i=1  ??1i (?)? ?  ?2 ln c n  (5)  or  ?0 ?  n  n ?  i=1  ??1i (1? ?) + ?  ?2 ln c n  . (6)  Remark: The inequality (4) and the inequalities (5) and (6) are not equivalent. In fact, the latter ones are just a special case of the former one.

It should be mentioned that there are lots of effective and efficient hypothesis tests designed for the cases that the observations of the samples are crisp numbers. We could rely on these hypothesis tests when the observations are uncertain variables. Consider a hypothesis test in the general form ?H0: ? ? ?0 versus H1: ? ? ?c0, and H0 is rejected if x belongs to the reject region R?. If the observations are imprecise and modeled by an uncertain vector ?, then we correspondingly have a hypothesis test ?H0: ? ? ?0 versus H1: ? ? ?c0, and H0 is rejected if the uncertain measure that ? belongs to the reject region R is greater than ?, i.e., M{? ? R} ? ??.

Example 8. Consider testing H0: ? = ?0 versus H1: ? 6= ?0 for the population with a normal distribution  f(x|?) = 1? 2?  exp  (  ? (x? ?)   )  .

As we know, a very useful test for precise observations is  reject H0 if  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?   n  n ?  i=1  xi ? ?0  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ? z?/2? n  where z?/2 is the ?/2 cutoff point of the standard normal distribution. Then for imprecise observations, we have the following test  reject H0 if M  {?  ?  ?  ?  ?   n  n ?  i=1  ?i ? ?0  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ? z?/2? n  }  ? ?.

This result can also be obtained when we take c = exp(?z2?/2/2) in Example 7.



VI. INTERVAL ESTIMATION  Interval estimation is concerned with finding an interval of possible values of an unknown parameter, in contrast to the point estimation which is concerned with finding a single value. It is essentially an inverse problem of the hypothesis test in some sense. This section introduces a method to find the likelihood interval of the unknown parameter based on the likelihood ratio function when the observations are uncertain variables.

Assume there are n imprecise observations of the samples from the population with a probability density function f(x|?), which we denote by uncertain variables ?1, ?2, ? ? ? , ?n. Let ? denote the set of possible values of ?, and ? denote the vector (?1, ?2, ? ? ? , ?n). Then the set  ?  ?  ?  ? ? ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  M  ?  ?  ?  L(?|?) sup ???  L(?|?) ? c  ?  ?  ?  ? ?  ?  ?  ?  is called the likelihood interval of ?, where c ? (0, 1) is some number to be selected based on the probability density function f , and the sample size n, and ? ? [0, 1] is the credibility level.

Example 9. Assume ?1, ?2, ? ? ? , ?n are imprecise observations of some samples from the population with an exponential distribution  f(x|?) = {  exp(?x+ ?), if x ? ? 0, otherwise.

This article has been accepted for publication in a future issue of this journal, but has not been fully edited. Content may change prior to final publication. Citation information: DOI 10.1109/TFUZZ.2017.2666846, IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems  TFS-2016-0612.R2 6  The likelihood function is  L(?|?) =  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  exp  (  ? n ?  i=1  ?i + n?  )  , if ? ? min 1?i?n  ?i  0, otherwise  and its supremum value is  sup ???  L(?|?) = exp (  ? n ?  i=1  ?i + n ? min 1?i?n  ?i  )  .

Then  L(?|?) sup ???  L(?|?) =  ?  ?  ?  exp  (  n? ? n ? min 1?i?n  ?i  )  , if ? ? min 1?i?n  ?i  0, otherwise,  and  M  ?  ?  ?  L(?|?) sup ???  L(?|?) ? c  ?  ?  ?  =M  {(  exp  (  n? ? n ? min 1?i?n  ?i  )  ? c )  ? (  ? ? min 1?i?n  ?i  )}  =M  {  ? ? min 1?i?n  ?i ? ? ? ln c  n  }  .

Thus the likelihood interval of unknown parameter ? is the solution set of the inequality  M  {  ? ? min 1?i?n  ?i ? ? ? ln c  n  }  ? ?. (7)  Furthermore, let ?1,?2, ? ? ? ,?n denote the uncertainty distri- butions of ?1, ?2, ? ? ? , ?n, respectively. Then according to the subadditivity of uncertain measure, we have  M  {  ? ? min 1?i?n  ?i ? ? ? ln c  n  }  ?M {  min 1?i?n  ?i ? ? ? ln c  n  }  ?M {  min 1?i?n  ?i < ?  }  = max 1?i?n  ?i  (  ? ? ln c n  )  ? max 1?i?n  ?i (?) .

Then the set {  ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  ?  max 1?i?n  ?i  (  ? ? ln c n  )  ? max 1?i?n  ?i (?) ? ? }  (8)  is a subset of the likelihood interval of the unknown parameter ?. In practice, we usually only know the uncertainty distribu- tions of the observations. In this case, we cannot get the exact solution set of the inequality (7), so we may regard the set (8) as the likelihood interval.

Example 10. Assume ?1, ?2, ? ? ? , ?n are imprecise observa- tions of some samples from the population with a normal distribution  f(x|?) = 1? 2?  exp  (  ? (x? ?)   )  .

The likelihood function is  L(?|?) = n ?  i=1  1? 2?  exp  (  ? (?i ? ?)   )  =  (2?)n/2 exp  (  ?1  n ?  i=1  (?i ? ?)2 )  ,  and its supremum value is  sup ???  L(?|?) = sup ???   (2?)n/2 exp  (  ?1  n ?  i=1  (?i ? ?)2 )  =  (2?)n/2 exp  ?  ??1  n ?  i=1  (  ?i ?  n  n ?  i=1  ?i  )2 ?  ? .

Then  L(?|?) sup ???  L(?|?)  = exp  ?  ?    n ?  i=1  (  ?i ?  n  n ?  i=1  ?i  )2  ? 1  n ?  i=1  (?i ? ?)2 ?  ?  = exp  ?  ??n  n ?  i=1  (   n  n ?  i=1  ?i ? ? )2 ?  ? ,  and  M  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  L(?|?) sup ???  L(?|?) ? c  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  =M  ?  ?  ?  exp  ?  ??n  n ?  i=1  (   n  n ?  i=1  ?i ? ? )2 ?  ? ? c  ?  ?  ?  =M  {?  ?  ?  ?  ?   n  n ?  i=1  ?i ? ? ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ? ?  ?2 ln c n  }  =M  {  ?? ?  ?2 ln c n  ? 1 n  n ?  i=1  ?i ? ?+ ?  ?2 ln c n  }  .

Thus the likelihood interval of the unknown parameter ? is the solution set of the inequality  M  {  ?? ?  ?2 ln c n  ? 1 n  n ?  i=1  ?i ? ?+ ?  ?2 ln c n  }  ? ?. (9)  Furthermore, let ?1,?2, ? ? ? ,?n denote the uncertainty dis- tributions of ?1, ?2, ? ? ? , ?n, respectively. Then the uncertainty distribution of   n  n ?  i=1  ?i  is  ?(x) = sup x1+x2+???+xn=nx  ?1(x1) ? ?2(x2) ? ? ? ? ? ?n(xn).

VII. CONCLUSION  Uncertain statistical inference is a methodology to deal with statistical inference problems with imprecise observa- tions. This paper characterized the imprecise observations as uncertain variables, and studied the related inference problems including point estimation, hypothesis test and interval estima- tion. The method of moments and the method of maximum likelihood estimation were given for the first problem, and the method of likelihood ratio function was given for the other two problems.
