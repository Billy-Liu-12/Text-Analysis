Abstract?The tropospheric Infrared Mapping Spectrometers (TIMS) operating at 2.33 and 4.68 ?m were developed to demonstrate retrieval of atmospheric CO in several layers. In this presentation we describe the architecture of the 2.33 TIMS spectrometer, recap its development, develop its noise model, and validate that against TIMS demonstration data. We briefly describe a multi-channel geostationary space application, called geoCARB, of the TIMS technology and use the model to predict its signal to noise ratio (SNR).
