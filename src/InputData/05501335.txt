ABSTRACT Data centers are facilities that house large numbers of  computer servers that dissipate high power. Due to varying  operational loads their efficient thermal management is a big  challenge that needs to be addressed. Computational modeling  using a CFD code is a very useful technique for studying the  cooling requirements for different data center power loading  and room configuration. Much of the existing numerical  modeling research literature focuses on simulating the data  center thermal environment with constant operating conditions.

In reality, data centers have highly time dependent operating  conditions i.e. fluctuations in server power and A/C flow rates.

Recent computational studies have shown that time dependent  fluctuations in server rack power can lead to rapid fluctuations  in rack inlet temperatures. For optimal data center performance,  the cold air supply should also increase or decrease with the  rack power. In this paper, a detailed numerical study of data  center thermal performance is presented with time dependent  power and cooling air supply conditions. Results are presented  for average rack inlet temperatures as a function of time for  different case studies. Fluctuations in inlet temperatures are  explained by evaluation of the temperature and flow fields in a  basic data center configuration.

INTRODUCTION Data processing equipment are continuously increasing in  power consumption. Nowadays, computer racks with power as  high as 32 kW are commonly used. This level of power  consumption obviously raises the heat dissipated from the  computer racks, which in turn requires more cooling of the data  center facilities to allow the operation of the data processing  equipment at acceptable temperatures. Considering the trends of  increasing heat loads and data center size, a critical concern in  data center operation is providing adequate airflow through the  equipment at a temperature that meets the equipment  manufacturers? requirements.  This is a very complex problem  considering the dynamics of a data center [1-5].

The rapid increase in energy consumption for cooling data  center facilities has become a major concern for data center  managers over the past few years. Many approaches are being  considered for reducing energy consumption for the cooling of  data center facilities such as the use of wet-bulb economizers  [6], the use of evaporative cooling [7], and adapting certain  practices in operating a data center facility [8]. In addition, the  development of efficiency measures for data center energy  efficiency characterization such as power usage effectiveness  (PUE) and data center infrastructure (DCiE) [9] are becoming  important.

Another solution approach to reducing energy consumption  is the use of dynamic thermal management to operate a data  center facility which promises significant reductions in energy  consumed for cooling [10]. In dynamic cooling, monitoring the  servers use along with real-time temperature distributions from  sensors is used to predict the thermal load in the server room.

Based on these predictions, cooling loads for different regions  in a data center room can be determined and more efficient  cooling can be applied eliminating redundant cooling. In order  to achieve effective dynamic thermal management of a data  center, transient thermal analysis using CFD modeling is  required.

Computational analyses using specialized CFD software  have been used to better understand and design data centers for  many years. However, most of the analyses conducted in the  past have been concerned only with steady state behavior of the  data center. Fixed flow rates and rack powers are imposed, and  the codes are used to obtain the steady state temperatures of the  data center room. Various changes can occur in an operating  data center such as the rack power or the CRAC supply flow  rate or temperature. This in turn changes the dynamics of the  data center room, and understanding the effect of these changes  is of great importance for dynamic cooling. In order to address  this problem, transient analysis of data centers is required.

The most popular configuration adopted by many data  centers nowadays is the raised floor configuration, and therefore  it is used for all the analysis in this paper.  A typical raised floor  data center with room return infrastructure is illustrated in fig 1.

In this design, the computer room air conditioning (CRAC)  units push cold air into the plenum, from where it is introduced  into the computer room via perforated floor tiles.

Fig 1: Typical raised floor data center configuration with  alternating hot and cold aisle arrangement.

NUMERICAL MODELING Fig 2 shows the data center room model considered in the  present study, which also was previously used by Bhopte et al.

[11-13]. The data center has 20 server racks, each dissipating  power that varies between 16kW and 32kW with a fixed air  flow  through each rack of 2000 CFM (0.943 m /s). The  temperature rise across the racks varies between 15?C and 30?C  for 16kW and 32kW power, respectively. Four CRAC units  supply air at 15?C to the raised floor plenum. A plenum depth of  0.3 m with 50% open tiles is used for all the analyses. The  computational studies are performed using the CFD software  Flotherm [14]. The fluid flow and heat transfer equations are  solved numerically using the standard k-? turbulence model.

Buoyancy effects were accounted for using the Boussinesq  Approximation. Effects of radiation were ignored. Temperature  data was recorded at six vertical locations at the center of each  rack. The monitor points were located in the cold aisle to  measure the inlet temperatures into the rack at an offset of  75mm from the rack. The lowest monitor point is located at a  height of 333mm and the highest one at 1750mm, above the  raised floor.

Prior to conducting any parametric studies mesh sensitivity  analyses are carried out to obtain grid independent temperature  and flow distributions. Figs 3(a) and 3(b) show rack inlet  temperature versus number of grid cells for racks A1 and A6,  monitored at a height of 1750mm above the raised floor, for two  different times during a transient run. The plots show  independent grids beyond 200k grid cells. The number of grid  cells used for all the analyses is 230k.

TRANSIENT CASE STUDIES There are a large number of transient scenarios in the  operation of a data center facility that could be investigated  relating to airflow dynamics and rack temperatures. Primary  factors are clearly fluctuations in power and CRAC airflow. For  this reason, 5 transient case studies are conducted to mimic 5  different scenarios that can occur in a data center facility, with  varying power and CRAC airflow. The case studies are intended  to give a general understanding into how the temperatures and  flow distributions change in the room with time dependent  power and CRAC airflow. Fig 4 shows the generic profile used  throughout the study for varying either power or CRAC airflow.

Besides the mesh sensitivity analysis required to verify  the computations, for transient analysis it is necessary to  conduct a time step sensitivity analysis to obtain time step  independent temperatures and flow distributions. Fig 5a is a  plot of inlet temperature vs. time for rack A1 monitored at a       height of 1750mm above the raised floor, for computational  runs using four different time steps. The designations 1 step to 4  step refer to the number of seconds corresponding to a time step  (i.e., 1 step corresponds to a transient run with a time step of 1  second; 2 step refers to a time step of 2 seconds, etc).  One can  see from fig 5b that the results for the larger time steps deviate  from the 1 second time step results. It is desirable to use larger  time steps for a transient analysis as it cuts down the  computational time significantly. However, that should not be  on the cost of inaccurate results. For the purpose of obtaining  accurate results, all the transient runs are conducted with a 1  second time step size. A detailed study on the spatial and time  grid sensitivity is found at [15].

CASE STUDY I: VARIABLE POWER; CONSTANT  AIRFLOW In the first case study, the rack power is varied while  the CRAC airflow supply is kept constant at 80% supply. Fig 6  shows the power profile with time. Fig 7 is a plot of the inlet  temperature of each rack in row A, averaged along the height of  each rack. The change in inlet temperature with time follows the  power profile. The room is initially at 15?C, when a power of  16kW and an airflow supply of 80% are applied. The  temperature values reach a steady state, and then the power is  increased, raising the inlet temperatures simultaneously.

Similarly, ramping down the power decreases the inlet  temperatures until a steady state is reached once again. Row D  racks follow the same trend for the change in inlet temperatures  with time. However, an interesting behavior is observed in fig  8a, where at time 300 seconds, the temperatures stop increasing  for a few seconds, before they rapidly increase again and finally  reach a steady state. It is important to note that at time 300  seconds, the power was kept constant at 32kW. In order to  further investigate this behavior, a transient run was conducted  without accounting for buoyancy effects. In comparing figs 8a  and 8b, we can note that the effect is indeed due to buoyancy. At  time 300 seconds, there is an accumulated heat mass at the hot  aisle of rack D. Buoyancy opposes the top recirculation of the  accumulated heat mass which causes the slow increase in  temperature, until it starts to increase again and reaches steady  state. In fig 8b, where buoyancy effects are neglected, the  behavior is not observed. Fig 9 shows the temperature contours  for different times around rack D1.  The figure shows the  accumulated heat mass at the hot aisle, taking time to recirculate  into the cold aisle.

CASE STUDY II: CONSTANT POWER; VARIABLE  AIRFLOW In this case study, the rack power is kept constant at  32kW, while the CRAC airflow supply is varied. Fig 10 shows  the CRAC airflow supply profile with time. Figs 11 (a & b)  show the change in average inlet temperature with time for the  racks of rows A and D, respectively. As expected, the lower  CRAC air supply causes higher inlet temperature values. An  interesting behavior is observed when the CRAC air supply is  ramped up and down, where fluctuations in the inlet  temperatures take place especially for row A racks. These  fluctuations are explained by the changing airflow pattern in the  room, where recirculation zones are changing with time. Fig 12  shows plots of the velocity vectors in the room at various times  with a zoomed in plot of rack A1. We can note from the figure  the change in the recirculation zones around rack A1, which  follow the fluctuations in inlet temperatures.

CASE STUDY III: VARIABLE POWER; VARIABLE  AIRFLOW In this case study, both rack power and CRAC airflow  supply are varied with time using the profile shown in fig 13.

The power is varied between 16kW and 32kW, while the CRAC  airflow supply is varied between 60% and 100% supply. Similar  behaviors are observed as in the previous case, where  fluctuations in inlet temperatures take place as the power and  airflow supply are ramped up and down. However, even though  both power and airflow follow the same profile, the airflow  seems more dominant at the beginning of the ramp up. The inlet  temperatures dip down first before rising back up and finally  reaching steady state. Figs 14 (a & b) show the change in  average inlet temperature with time for racks of rows A and B,  respectively. It is clear, especially in fig 13b, how changing the  airflow has a more immediate effect which is indicated by the  initially reduced inlet temperature before they eventually  increase due to the increase in power. This indicates that the  airflow has a more rapid effect on the inlet temperatures than  the power.

CASE STUDY IV: VARIABLE POWER; VARIABLE  AIRFLOW (AIRFLOW LAGGING) In the previous case study the power and airflow were both  varied with time, following the same profile. In real data center  facility operation, there will be variability in the transient  behavior of power and air flow. To investigate typical scenarios,  the power and airflow are varied using the profile in fig 15,  where the airflow is lagging by an arbitrary amount of 150  seconds. Fig 16 shows the change in average inlet temperature  with time for the row A racks. With the airflow lagging, the inlet  temperatures reach undesirable values as high as 55 ?C, before  the temperatures drop back down as the airflow starts to vary.

The longer the lag in changing the airflow, the longer the period  at which data processing equipment are operated at  unacceptable temperatures. We can note from the figure that  changing the power alone causes no fluctuations in temperature.

This is because the airflow dynamics in the room are not  changing. Once airflow is varied, at time 350 seconds,  fluctuations in the inlet temperatures are observed. When  comparing the slope of the inlet temperature as it increases and  as it decreases, it is obvious that the decreasing slope is much  steeper. This is another indicator that the airflow effect on the  inlet temperatures in the room is faster than the effect of power.

CASE STUDY V: VARIABLE POWER; VARIABLE  AIRFLOW (AIRFLOW LEADING) Finally, the case with airflow leading the power variation is  investigated. Fig 17 shows the profile of varying airflow and  power, with the airflow leading by 150 seconds. Fig 18 shows  the change in average inlet temperature with time for the row A  racks. For this case, the opposite response occurs, with the inlet  temperatures are always maintained at acceptable values. For a  small period of time, the inlet temperatures reach lower values  than required which could indicate a situation of redundant  over-supplied cooling. Such situations most likely are quite  common in data center facilities. The longer redundant cooling  is applied the more energy is wasted.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS In this paper, an application of transient CFD modeling for  raised floor data centers is presented. Power and CRAC airflow  supply were varied with time using a general profile. Different  scenarios were investigated which included varying power  alone, varying CRAC airflow alone or varying both together.

Case study I: Interesting behavior was observed when varying  power alone, where it was determined that buoyancy effects  were significant in the variation of inlet temperatures with time.

Case study II: When varying CRAC airflow alone, fluctuations  in temperatures occurred, indicating the changing airflow  pattern in the room with time. Recirculation zones were seen  diffusing in and out of the inlet flow to the racks with time.

Case study III: As both rack power and CRAC airflow were  varied together, it is clear that the inlet temperatures vary  sooner due to the air flow rather than the power. This can be  explained by the fact that the airflow is directly applied to the  cold aisle, where the inlet temperature values are measured. In  the other case, power depends on top and edge recirculation to  affect the inlet temperatures and therefore has a slower effect.

Case study IV & V: Varying power causes no fluctuations in  inlet temperatures as the airflow dynamics in the room do not  change significantly. The presence of a lag between CRAC  airflow and power presents two situations; if CRAC airflow is  lagging, unacceptable operating temperatures are reached. On  the other hand, if power is lagging, redundant cooling is  applied.

Future studies will include accounting for the thermal mass of  computer racks. Also, applying a variable rack fan with time  will further improve the practicality of the transient model  compared to a real life data center facility.
