Abstract: The work presented in this paper focuses on discovering  ordering rules between ordinal attributes. Generally speaking, rough set theory is the foundation of many algorithms of mining ordering rules. We provide a new approach using algorithm of mining association rules to solve this problem.

The key to the problem is to transform information tables into transaction database. The comparison results demonstrate that our method can find more interesting ordering rules.

If-then rules are well-known techniques for representation of knowledge. Traditionally, classification methods of machine learning or data mining are always used for knowledge discovering. They commonly deal with attributes without considering ordinal information. However, we may come across many practical applications such as ranking of consumer products, ranking of universities and multi-criteria decision problem, etc.

[1,8], which have ordinal attributes. To make use of the potential ordinal nature, in recent years there have been several literatures having theoretically discussed the problem based on the rough sets theory introduced by Pawlak [4]. Iwinski [2, 3] introduces ordinal information system which concerns with the way for representation and reduct of weak orders. Grecob et al. [8] study decision rules generation in the context of multicriteria decision making based on pairwise comparison table. Lee et al. [7], prove that any weak order is equivalent to a family of nested sets correspond to the equivalence classes in the classic rough set theory. In Sai et al. [1], the authors put forward a data analysis model used to mine ordering rules. Zhong et al. [9] give the practical method of using ordinal information.

All above studies concern about the process of information  table reducts and rule generation.

Sai et al. [1] first brought up finding the qualitative  ordering rules described as ?if the value of an object x on an attribute a is ordered ahead of the value of another object y on the same attribute, then x is ordered ahead of y?. Since then the problem has fascinated many workers in this fields.

It calls for much further research effort in this field. In this paper, our investigations have been further extended to discovering the extension ordering rules , that is ?if the value of an object x on an attribute a is ordered ahead of the value of another object y on the same attribute, then x is ordered ahead of y on a certain attribute "[1]. We undertook our investigations in the hope of providing another mining method which is different from rough set theory to find comprehensive ordering rules.

2. Finding ordering rules  2.1. Ordered Information Tables Overview  The ordered information table, IT= (TB, R) is introduced by Sai et al. [1]. The table consists of two elements. One is the standard information table TB= (U, A, V, f), the other is a set of ordinal relation on each attribute, R={ >a, a?A}. The standard information table formally represented as 4-tuple, TB= (U, A, V, f). Where U is a the universe of discourse with finite nonempty d objects, U={x1, x2,?, xd}, A is a set of n attributes A= {a1, a2,?,an}, f is a set of functions, fa: U?Va ,a?A, where Va is a set of values for an attribute a and  Va?V. For every attribute a ?A, there is a liner order >a on Va ,thus, it induces a weak order on U.

2.2. Association Rule Discovery Overview  Discovery of association rules is introduced by Agrawal et al [5, 6].The following is a formal statement of the problem [5]: Let I = {i1, i2, ... , im} be a set of items. Let D be a database of transactions, each transaction T is a set      of items, and each transaction have a unique identifier, viz.

TID. An association rule is an implication of the expression A ? B, where itemsets A, B ? I, and A ? B = ?. The confidence of rule A ? B means support (A? B)/support (A). The support (A) =x% means x% of transactions in D contain A.

Considering a set of transactions D, discovered association rules must satisfy the constrain that their support and confidence greater than the user-specified minimum support and minimum confidence respectively. It should be pointed out that association rules are only reflections of relationships in a transaction database. The key association rules discovery algorithm is Apriori [5], since its occurrence many enhanced algorithm have been put forward [10]. Without losing generality, we adopt Apriori [5].

2.3. Process of Discovering Ordering Rules  Given an ordinal information system, U is a finite nonempty set of objects, U={x1, x2,?, xd}, A is a finite nonempty set of attributes, A= {a1, a2,?,an}, F is a set of  order relation on each attribute, F= },...,,{  21 naaa >>>  .

The process of discovering ordering rules is as  follows: First of all ordered information tables (proposed in 2.1)  must be given.

Secondly, transform ordered information tables into  transaction data tables. From ordered information table, we compute each pare of object on a certain attribute.

Given ?(xi,xj)?UXU ,xi?xj, for an given attribute ai ?A, if xi >ai xj then fai(xi, xj)= (ai,>) else fai(xi, xj)= (ai,?).

So each object is translated into a transaction.

Thirdly, using Apriori to discover association rules from transaction data tables. The form of the rule is (a1, p1),(a2, p2),?(am, pm) ?(ak, pk) (s, c) ,where aj (j=1,2,?m ?n)is one of attributes, pj (j=1,2,?m?n) and pk are ?>? or ???, ak is different from aj (j=1,2,?m), s represents support and c represents confidence in percentage.

Lastly,  analyzing the discovery rules.

2.4. An Example  An example is given to illustrate the process of rule discovery.

For the purpose of comparison studies, we cite the table from [1] ?revised?in the following.

Table 1 ordered information table  a b c d o  p1 middle 3 months $200  heavy  1 p2 large 3 months $300  very heavy  3  p3 small 3 months $300  light  3  p4 small 3 months $250  very light  2 p5 small 2 months $200  very light 3          According to the second step of above process, table 1 is transformed into transaction data table showed in table 2  Table 2 ordered transaction dataset object a b c d o  (1,2) (a,>) (b,?) (c,>) (d,>) (o,>) (1,3) (a,?) (b,?) (c,>) (d,?) (o,>) (1,4) (a,?) (b,?) (c,>) (d,?) (o,>) (1,5) (a,?) (b,>) (c,?) (d,?) (o,>) (2,1) (a,?) (b,?) (c,?) (d,?) (o,?) (2,3) (a,?) (b,?) (c,?) (d,?) (o,?) (2,4) (a,?) (b,?) (c,?) (d,?) (o,?) (2,5) (a,?) (b,>) (c,?) (d,?) (o,?) (3,1) (a,>) (b,?) (c,?) (d,>) (o,?) (3,2) (a,>) (b,?) (c,?) (d,>) (o,?) (3,4) (a,?) (b,?) (c,?) (d,?) (o,?) (3,5) (a,?) (b,>) (c,?) (d,?) (o,?) (4,1) (a,>) (b,?) (c,?) (d,>) (o,?) (4,2) (a,>) (b,?) (c,>) (d,>) (o,>) (4,3) (a,?) (b,?) (c,>) (d,>) (o,>) (4,5) (a,?) (b,>) (c,?) (d,?) (o,>) (5,1) (a,>) (b,?) (c,?) (d,>) (o,?) (5,2) (a,>) (b,?) (c,>) (d,>) (o,?) (5,3) (a,?) (b,?) (c,>) (d,>) (o,?) (5,4) (a,?) (b,?) (c,>) (d,?) (o,?)  Using Apriori algorithm, we find many more association rules. We chose some interesting rules listed below:  R1? (c,?),  (b,?)?(o,?)  (40.0%, 100.0%)  R2? (c,>) ? (o,>)   (25.0%, 62.5%)  R3? (b,>) ? (o,>)   (10.0%, 50.0%)  (a,>) ?(o,?)   (25.0%, 71.4%)  >a: small >a middle >a large, >b: 3 months >b 2 months, >c: $200 >c $250 >c $300, >d: very light >d light >d heavy >d very heavy, >o: 1 >o 2 >o 3.

(d,>) ?(o,? )  (30.0%, 66.7%)  (d,>) ?(b,?)   (45.0%, 100.0%)  (d,?)?(a,? )  (55.0%, 100.0%)  (a,?)?(d,? )  (55.0%, 84.6%)  (d,?)?(o,? )  (35.0%, 63.6%)  (c,?)?(o,?)   (50.0%, 83.3%)  (a,?)?(o,? )  (40.0%, 61.5%)  (o,?)?(a,? )  (40.0%, 61.5%)  (o,?)?(b,? )  (55.0%, 84.6%)  (b,?)?(o,?)   (55.0%, 68.8%)  (d,?) ,(c,?)?(a,?)  (40.0%, 100.0%)  (c,?), (a,?)?(d,?)  (40.0%, 100.0%)  (d,?) ,(c,?)?(o,?)  (30.0%, 75.0%)  (d,?) ,(a,?)?(o,? ) (35.0%, 63.6%)  (d,?), (o,?)?(a,?)  (35.0%, 100.0%)  (d,?), (b,?)?(a,? ) (35.0%, 100.0%)  (c,?) ,(a,?)?(o,? ) (30.0%, 75.0%)  (c,?) ,(o,?)?(b,? ) (40.0%, 80.0%)  (o,? ),(b,?)?(c,?)  (40.0%, 72.7%)  The first three discovered rules R1?, R2?and R3? correspond to R1, R2 and R3 in [1] respectively. The confidence is just the accuracy defined by [1].

2.5. Discussion  Comparing with the constructed binary pare wise table in [1], the table in our method can be regard as a multi-value table with ordering semantic meaning. The rules found by [1] are concise, while the newly developed method is advantageous in finding more rules. It is convenient to mine rules using association rule algorithm.

From above example, we can see that the discovered ordinal association rules are comprehensive and more interesting, although the rules are not truly implicating rules.

For example the two rules (d,? )? (a,?  )  (55.0%, 100.0%) and (b,?)?(o,?)   (55.0%, 68.8%) have higher support and confidence, reflecting close relationship between attributes. The rule (b,?)?(o,?) (55.0%, 68.8%) is more convictive then (b,>) ? (o,>) (10.0%, 50.0%)  with (accuracy=0.5 coverage=0.286[1]) . Sometimes conflict will occur in the discovered rules, this need giving higher support and confidence and other analysis. Due to the nature of Apriori, it can not lose the knowledge contained in the transaction datasets. Therefore, more interesting ordering rules will be found by the proposed method so long as given smaller support and confidence.

3 Conclusions  We have demonstrated in this paper the new approach to mining ordering rules from ordinal information system.

The last mining steps are different from the framework of rough set method. The result suggests that more interesting ordinal rules can be found using our method. It gives another method to discover qualitative ordering rules. In the future, practical application and combination with other data mining and machine learning methods will be discussed.
