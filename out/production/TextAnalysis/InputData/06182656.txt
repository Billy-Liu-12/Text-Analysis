I.  INTRODUCTION AND LITERATURE REVIEW  According to the World Health Organization, cancer is the leading cause of deaths globally [1]. Among all types of cancer, liver cancer has the lowest survivability [3], with approximately 1 million deaths each year [1]. Its rising incidence in the past decade is projected to continue [4] and is associated with varying demographic factors [11]. Data mining can be of great utility in better understanding which risk factors are associated with increased incidence of liver cancer, as suggested by previous studies [5-9].

In data mining, association analysis is a method for discovering interesting relationships or patterns between variables [10]. The Apriori and FP-growth association algorithms are the two most efficient association algorithms for a data set the size of ours [10, 11]. Their efficiency is based on generating frequent itemsets and rules based on support level and confidence measures.



II. METHODOLOGY The aim of this paper is to apply data mining algorithms (Apriori and FPGrowth) to anonymized liver cancer data extracted from the Electronic Health Record systems of the BC Cancer Agency. A made-up dataset of 57 patients was produced for preliminary use while waiting for the real data.

Both datasets consist of the following attributes:  1. city 2. health authority 3. gender (male or female) 4. age at diagnosis 5. surgery (yes or no) 6. radiotherapy (yes or no) 7. chemotherapy (yes or no) 8. alive or dead 9. cause of death   We submitted the data to the FPGrowth algorithm in stages:

I. prior data, meant to identify which factors lead to an increased incidence of liver cancer, and consisting of the first four attributes listed above;

II. survivability data, meant to identify which factors affect survivability among patients diagnosed with liver cancer, and consisting of all nine attributes.



III. RESULTS  Association rules produced by the Apriori and FPGrowth algorithms reveal demographic factors associated with increased incidence of liver cancer and may provide a mechanism for early detection.

Association rules Support Confidence age 60 through 69 ? liver cancer 8 60% no radiotherapy, male ? alive 9 67% chemotherapy, male ? deceased 9 69% no surgery, no chemotherapy ? deceased  9 65%  chemotherapy, no surgery ? alive 9 65% male, no surgery ? alive 9 63%  These rules are obtained from made-up data. Therefore they should not be interpreted as indicators of reality.
