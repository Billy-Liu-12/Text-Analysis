Opinion Analysis of Product Reviews

Abstract   With more and more reviews on the web, browsing  through a mass of the related reviews becomes a heavy work. How to effectively analyzing and organizing these reviews attracts more attention. This paper pursues on the analysis of product reviews. It focuses on the product features that customer commented on and also whether their opinions are positive or negative. Different from the traditional method, we view the product features recognition as an information extraction task. Combined the domain knowledge and lexical information, we adopt the supervised method--Conditional Random Fields to find the opinionated features. For the identification of the opinionated product feature?s orientation, it mainly bases on the domain knowledge, and considers from three levels, including sentence, context and word level. Our experimental results show that the proposed techniques are effective and promising.

1. Introduction   With the spread of the World Wide Web, more and more people express their opinions on almost anything in Internet, forums, blogs and community websites.

And more and more opinions absorb the special crowd.

For example, the government and politicians are interested in the response of governmental policies, merchants and potential customers are interested in the feedback and comment of commercial products.

Therefore, how to analyze and monitor the tide of prevalent attitudes on the web, how to extricate people from wading through a large number of opinions to find their interest, have been receiving a lot of attention in natural language processing research community.

This paper focuses on the analysis of product opinions. Given an opinion, the task is to extract product feature associated with its subjective orientation. That means to find the interested product feature and catch how people feel on it. This work could let people easily read an opinion with a different color drawn on different orientation features.

Furthermore, this information could be used to deeply analyze prevalent attitudes or generate various types of opinion summaries.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: section 2 describes the related work on opinion analysis. Section 3 gives the problem statement and outlines our approach. Section 4 presents the details on key techniques. Section 5 gives the experiment and results. Finally section 6 concludes this paper.

2. Related Work   Recently, a series of topic sessions and evaluations on opinion analysis appear in TREC and NTCIR[1].

The grain of the opinion analysis could be divided into document level, sentence level and feature level. For document and sentence level, it mainly tries to classify what is and what is not an opinion, distinguishes the positive and negative opinions[2]. For feature level, it mostly focuses on the extracting and analyzing the product features, finds the commented features, furthermore to generate opinion summaries. For example, Opinion Observer focuses on customer reviews on the web and provides the visual comparison of consumer opinions[3]. Red Opal as a search system enables customers to locate products rapidly based on features[4].

This paper focuses on analyzing product features, it includes the features recognizing, the associated opinion words confirming and the orientation identifying. At present, the techniques on recognizing product features are primarily based on unsupervised mining. Liu adopts association rule mining for extracting frequent features[5,6]. Popescu utilizes relation-specific extraction patterns with web PMI assessor for assessing feature candidates[7]. However, using frequency measure tends to prefer to high frequency features. This leads to the low frequency ones might be missed. For the opinion words confirming, the method of the nearest vicinity match is simple and effective[5,7]. Further, Su focuses on the association between the features and opinion words by mutual reinforcement approach[8]. And for the   DOI 10.1109/FSKD.2009.200    DOI 10.1109/FSKD.2009.200     orientation identifying, Ding combines the linguistic rules and opinion aggregation function to determine the semantic orientation[9].

Our techniques are domain related. Different from the widely used unsupervised methods, we adopt supervised mining on features recognizing, aiming to find product features combining its frequency, syntax tokens and domain knowledge. We regard it as an entity recognizing process, and hope to transfer the effective NER techniques to solve our problem. For the opinion words confirming and orientation identifying, our technique mainly bases on domain opinion dictionary and imports multi-level analysis module.

We think that domain knowledge could improve the quality of opinion analysis.

3. Overview  3.1. Problem statement   Task: Given a sentence S, assign each tuple (f, o) in S, where f is the opinionated product feature in sentence S, o is the orientation of the features f. Here, feature set is an open set, orientation labels set is ({positive, negative}).

For example: Sentence S: ????????????????  ????????(The hotel is good at service, and its position is good, but it doesn?t have a swimming pool.)  The tuples ( ? ? (service), positive), ( ? ? (position), positive), ( ? ? ? (swimming pool), negative) would be assigned as the right result.

Our task is mainly focuses on the opinionated product feature extraction. The associated opinion words are hidden in the task, though used for orientation identification.

3.2. System Architecture   Given a sentence, the system operates in the following steps. First it preprocesses the sentence to get the needed tokens. Next, it selects all the product feature candidates. Then, the opinion word associated for the features is found and orientation is identified.

Finally, the system chooses the features with positive or negative orientation, ignores the features with neutral orientation or no opinion words matched.

Figure 1 gives the system architecture.

4. Key Techniques  4.1. Feature Recognition   This step is to find out the product features that  people talked about. The product features are context related, and for a given domain it has the lexical or syntactic similarity. So we adopt a supervised method and transform it into a sequence tagging problem. We aim to find a method which could make the best use of the existed resource and find the product features even given a document or a sentence. For the frequency measure methods, they are based on the statistic of the corpus, when only given a single sentence, they couldn?t execute effectively.

Conditional Random Fields[10] is used to implement this task. It has the advantages of relaxing strong independence assumptions made in HMM[11], and avoiding the label bias problem existed in MEMM[12]. And it has been proved well performance in information extraction field.

Token selection is important for machine learning algorithm, which influences the performance of the algorithm directly. To choose the token, we consider two properties of opinion sources. First, the product features in the opinion source are mostly noun or noun phrases. Second, the opinionated product features should be in an opinion expression.

With these properties in mind, we define the following tokens, which including word, POS and semantic information.

Without more deep analysis of the syntactic and semantic of the sentence, we only use the shallow semantic tokens and domain knowledge.

They are listed in Table 1.

Tuples: (f1, o1),(f2, o2)?  Sentence  Domain Knowledge  Feature Dictionary  Opinion Dictionary  POS Tagger  Feature Recognition  Opinion Word Confirmation  Orientation Identification  Sentence  Figure 1. System Architecture       Table 1 Description of token in model  Token type Token Description  Word T Word  POS Pos(T) POS  Semantic  IsDict Is in product feature Dict.

HDict Is the head part of feature in Dict.

MDict Is the mid part of feature in Dict.

EDict Is the tail part of feature in Dict.

IsEva Is in opinion Dict.

IsFactor Is in emotional adverb Dict.

We use words token to get the context information.

We consider the neighboring words in a region with the max window 4 in order to note the context.

POS token is adopted to capture the word-building and simple syntax information. With the part-of-speech tags: noun, verb, adverb, punctuation.etc. The noun phrase could be exhibited in a neighboring window.

For the semantic token, we import the product features dictionary. With a binary feature that indicates whether the word is in a dictionary or not. And we also consider whether it is the part of an item or not.

Because the product features might have the same or similar component in a given domain. For example, optical zoom, digital zoom, zoom lens are all the features in digital camera domain, they have the same word ?zoom? as the feature component.

We also introduce opinion and adverb dictionary in order to import more domain knowledge and more information about the opinion source. For the existing of an opinion word or emotional adverb are more likely to indicate the presence of an opinion. By observing, people often like to express their opinions around the product feature. So we could catch the simple collocation and pattern between the opinion word and the product features in a window by these token.

In this step, we not only tag the product features but also tag the opinion words as attachment.

4.2. Opinion Word Confirmation   Without parsing the sentence, we also adopt the  nearest vicinity match to confirm the associated opinion word. As observed, the opinion word mostly appears around the features in the sentence. So we take the product feature as the center, find the nearest opinion word tagged by CRFs at the above step as the associated opinion word. If there is no opinion word,  then we look at the opinion dictionary for the further search.

4.3. Orientation Identification   We assign the orientation to a given feature from  multi-level, which includes the sentence, context and opinion word three level. It is defined in the following way.

O(fi)=IsO(S)*IsN(ai)* Sign(oi)            (1)  Here, IsO(S) is a two value function, which judges the orientation of the feature by sentence level. If the sentence is judged to have no sentiment, then its value is 0, else is 1. At present, we only consider assumption sentence. We think this type of sentence doesn?t express any opinion information, so the features in it should not be tagged.

IsN(ai) is also a two value function, which considers the sentiment transition by emotional adverbs or phrase. It is on the context level to consider the orientation. If there is such a word around the feature in a region, the value of the function is -1, else is 1.

Sign(oi) is directly the orientation of associated opinion word for the feature. Its value is defined as -1 for negative, 0 for neutral and 1for positive orientation.

Both the information about ai and oi are determined by looking at the dictionary.

There is a problem caused by CRFs tagging. For the opinion word tagged by CRFs might not be found in the dictionary, so its orientation is unknown. For these words, we treat the unit of it after POS as the minimal unit, look at dictionary once more, and combine the orientation by voting. For example, the opinion word has two POS units, if only one is in dictionary, then its orientation is decided by this one. If the two units have the opposite orientation, then the opinion word is neutral. This method is simple, which aims to decide the orientation of opinion word from its all constituent units.

5. Experiments  5.1. Corpus and Evaluation Metric   The data used in the experiment is provided by the COAE (The first Chinese Opinion Analysis and Evaluation), which was held in 2008, aims to enable researchers to participate in large-scale experiments and evaluations, make each researcher?s result comparable and promote the related technique in Chinese opinion analysis.

The data in COAE on the opinion feature extraction task contains two domains, automobile and electronic domains. For each domain, it has about 1500     sentences. All sentences have been annotated by human beforehand.

The precision, recall and F-measure will be presented for the task. Both the strict match and lenient match are adopted for evaluating the correct units.

Lenient match means if the result is only part of the standard, it is also thought to be the right one.

5.2. Results and Analysis  Table 2 and Table 3 present the evaluation results.

For the comparison with others, we also give the Avg.

and Max. values in the task. There are 13 participants in this task. Our system is named as FRDC.

That  means the result gives not only the opinionated features but also its orientation correctly. From Table 2, we see that the system has the comparatively high value in F-measure at strict metric, which proves the system architecture is reasonable and the proposed methods are effective. Unlike some systems with high value only in precision or recall, our system?s precision and recall are near and not inclined to one parameter excessively, which means our methods are more practical and feasible.

Second, we prove the performance on the opinionated features recognition without considering the subjective orientation. From Table 3, we see both the strict and lenient F-measure are the highest or nearly highest ones compared with the participants.

And the recall at strict metric is the highest one too.

This proves that the CRFs-based opinion feature extraction is feasible and valid.

Obviously the lenient values are all higher than that of strict values in Table 2 and Table 3. Our lenient results in Table 2 are not performing as good as that in Table 3, this means that our methods on feature recognition is valid, and the method of the orientation identification need to improve.

For the opinion orientation identification, as we known, some opinion words have different orientation modifying different features, and even change its orientation with different context. It is difficult to determine its orientation without deep context analysis.

And the long distance modification is still a block for natural language process techniques. At present, we don?t consider the orientation caused across the sentence.

Third, we want to see the performance of the system on different domain and testify the capability of domain transplant. The test data include automobile and electronic domains. The electronic domain could be divided into the Camera, Phone and Notebook sub-     domain. Table 4 gives the detail of the result of Table 2. We see that the performance on electronic domain is better than that on automobile domain on all parameters. But for the sub-domain on electronic domain the performance is similar. So we could conclude that the performance of the system is affected by the domain, but is not sensitive. When the difference between the two given domain is not significant, the performance is similar.

In these experiments, the low performance on automobile domain might be caused by many factors.

We only gives the plain explain and don?t analyze the reason from the quantity. One reason is that the product features is longer and more complex in automobile domain compared with electronic domain.

The other is that we also lack the resource on automobile domain.

6. Conclusions   In this paper, we probe into the problem of product opinions analysis. We describe the framework of the system and propose the method for the key techniques.

We transfer product features recognizing into information extraction task using CRFs. The multi- level analysis module is proposed in the orientation determining process. Our experimental results on COAE are encouraging, which prove the proposed techniques are effective in performing the task.

Compared with human annotation, there is still a gap needed to be filled by further improving these techniques. For example, the confirming on opinion words might adopt pattern or syntactic analysis. The orientation identification could combine the statistic information.
