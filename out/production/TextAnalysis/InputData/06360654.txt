Recommendation system for documentary  classification

Abstract? In the context of the NAR1 project ?Miipa-doc?, we develop a new type of Knowledge Organization System (KOS) called Hypertagging based on the tagging of electronic documents and the principles of faceted classification. It was designed to simplify the tasks of information management for the organizations? staff. In this paper, we propose a new recommendation model and algorithm which are based on a faceted classification by level in the aim to facilitate the documents? indexing. This approach exploits the user trace indexing of his/her documents to learn about the user preferences and then to produce their recommendations. Consequently, these recommendations will provide a kind of knowledge base aiming at improving document  ranking and highlight most relevant information that meeting user  needs. This model is based on a statistical method called Association Rules (AR) using an Apriori algorithm to generate the recommendations.

I.  INTRODUCTION Recommender Systems (RS) and Information Filtering (IF) are recently used in multiple domains like digital libraries and online advertising. They aim is to present the information (movies, music, books, news, images, web pages, etc.) that interest users. In this context, social bookmarking systems and folksonomies uses RS to suggest interesting items for users. A folksonomy is defined by the fact of sharing social resource between different users, while their assigning keywords called "tags". These systems are distinguished by the type of resource they support. Among the most popular social bookmarking systems, we cite Flickr 2  and Youtube 3  for media,   1 National Agency of Research  2 www.Flickr.org  Connotea 4 and CiteUlike 5  for scientific references and del.icio.us6 for web bookmark sharing. All these bookmarking services use tags to facilitate and to speed up the search and navigation tasks. To assist user in the process of resource describing, recommendation framework are integrated in tagging activity. In the context of NAR ?project Miipa-Doc? (Methods and Integrated Services for Institutional and Participatory Content Faceted Classification Documentaries complexes), we develop a new type of Knowledge Organization System (KOS) called Hypertagging [1] based on the tagging of electronic documents and on the principles of faceted classification. According to Gartner Inc, "The company employees spend 30 to 40% of their time to create, search, find, rearrange, and organize their documents. To overcome these problems, it is necessary to reduce the cognitive effort of the user and to ease the tracking of good facets and tags to classify its documents. In order to deal with these problems, several researches [2, 3, 4] propose a tag recommendation solution in the web field (websites, bibliographic resources, social networks links, etc.). These solutions are only based on user-resource-tag tripartite graphs and consider only the level of tag. In this paper, we propose an enhancement for the previous solutions. In fact, our solution is based on a new model quadripartite user-resource-facet-tag.

We tried to exploit the facet level consisting in a class of tag in the aim to reduce the number of item by eliminating from the outset not interesting facets.

In fact, when adding another level that filters items, their computation will be concentrated on relevant items only which provide more precise results.

In this paper we propose a new model of RS for faceted classification, called by level to assist the user in tagging  3 www.youtube.com 4 www.connetea.org 5 www.citeulike.org 6 www.delicious.com      documents. This approach takes into account the hierarchical structure of KOS faceted (facets and tags). In addition, tags in KOS system are grouped into classes called Facets or dimensions unlike tags clouds.

Therefore, the amount of data processed is significantly lower than baseline. Recommendations are generated at two levels, of the facets in the first time and second time the tags.

Indeed, we propose a recommendation algorithm inspired from association rules principles. The same algorithm is used to meet two objectives: the recommendation of facets and the recommendation of tags. This paper is organized as follows.

Section 2 presents an overview of the related works in the field of recommendation systems: principles and techniques of the existing recommendation systems, the operating principle of association rules and their application areas. We present in section 3 the context of our work especially Hypertagging components. Then, in Section 4 we introduce our model of recommendation per levels in a faceted KOS. We describe in Section 5 the algorithm process. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper and present future perspectives of this work.



II. RELATED WORKS  A. Recommendation and bookmarking on line The purpose of a recommendation system is to "recommend items (also called resources) to users related to their preferences and expectations. The aim is both to minimize the time spent on research and to suggest relevant items that would not be consulted spontaneously and increase their overall satisfaction"[5].

There are three types of recommendation techniques: filtering based on content [12], collaborative filtering [4], and hybrid filtering [13]. The first type consists is comparison between the user profile content items, while the second type takes into account the judgment of users on shared items leading to the discovery of neighboring users. The latter type combines both filtering based on content and collaborative filtering.

The recommendations may be made at two levels: when looking for relevant items or in their indexing step. Unlike works that use tags in the research phase to reformulate and expand the user queries [11], our approach supervises and assists the user during the documentary classification in order to suggest appropriate tags in the indexing phase.

B. Association rules The method of association rules was introduced by [14] in the aim to analyze the consumer?s basket. It is based on rules like "If a customer buys milk and bread then he/she will buy in the same time jam". More formally, an association rule takes the form X?Y, where X ? I, Y ? I, X ?Y=? where I is the set of items. A rule is composed by an X-antecedent and a part composed of a set Y disjoint from X. Two metrics are used to indicate the performance of rules: support and confidence.

-The support shows the proportion of transactions where the itemsets X ?  Y regarding the whole transactions.

? Sup (X?Y) = ?(??)                                           (1)  -The confidence is the proportion of transactions where the itemsets X?Y regarding the transactions where the itemsets X.

? Conf (X?Y) = 	( ?) ( )  (2)  In the aim to determine the frequent itemsets and to generate recommendations rules through the measurement of support and confidence proposed by the Apriori algorithm [15]. This is the first search algorithm of the most frequent pruning including steps to take into account the exponential increase in the number of candidate itemsets.

Mainly the association rules were used in the marketing field, and then it has spread to other application areas with different objectives such as: query reformulation in Information Retrieval (IR) [16], the folksonomies? structure [17], analysis of co-occurrences between the terms. In Information Retrieval, association rules have been integrated, for example, with ontologies to expand semantic queries [18], and for the improvement of a system of information retrieval in XML documents [19]. Association rules are also used for the recommendation. Indeed, [20], have developed a recommendation system based on the content of the pages already visited by the user (user trace) to help him in his next surfing in the Web. Moreover, in [3] they were used to increase the accuracy of predictions of tags.

We have some differences from [3] research at several points.

First, the type of input data is different: [3] exploit the polarity of tags, while we propose a new approach by recommendation levels (facets and tags) and we use tags created freely by the user and considered positive tags. Furthermore, the purpose of using association rules is also different. They serve, for them, firstly to improve the prediction of tags by extending the queries that are performed with a single tag, and secondly, to increase the rate of return if the URL become rare (indexed once or twice). In our approach the association rules are used, initially, at the recommendation of facets and tags for users to index documents by tagging already made and in a second step, the discovery and extraction knowledge.

In this paper, we focus only in the recommendation in the indexing phase. Our work is similar to [20] in the operating principle of the user trace to determine his/her preferences and  Tags clouds Facets    choices on the web, against the recommendation made at the stage of research information and not in document indexing.



III. RECOMMENDATION BY LEVEL IN THE KOS FACETED  A. Work Environment: Hypertagging Structuring elements of Hypertagging are conceptual and graphics constituents that enable users to classify their documents using these components. These components are the views, the Facets (or dimensions) and the tags.

The views are binders which a set of facets are grouped according on the one hand to share personal views of users, on the other hands to the organization of the company.

Figure1. Sets of facets of a researcher- teacher    For example the two views "Teaching" and "Research" presented in Figure 1 showing an instance of two different views of a teacher-researcher user? activities. Each order contains one or more facets. These facets are classes that organize a set of values, depending on their nature or terms under which they are considered. One of the original features of the representation of Hypertagging is the tags with icons called SemioTags. In the collaborative environment, these facets can be either an individual facet (used by one person) or shared (used by a group of people). The description of a document relies on tags, values of a facet. Tags are injected as document metadata.

B. Computing of correlation level in a KOS-faceted To determine the interests and user preferences, we focus  on determining the correlations between the facets and tags.

The determination of the most frequent itemset is done by the Apriori algorithm.

The objective is to calculate the correlations between different system components (facets and tags) from the most general (facet) to the most detailed (tag). We rely on the principle considering that: if a facet is common then it necessarily contains frequent tags. Our approach consists in two levels. The first one is the recommendation of the facets.

At this level, each classified document will be stored in a  database associated with its annotated facet. The second level is the recommendation of tags. At this level, the objective is to extract the most popular tags related by exploiting the correlation of the facets identified above. Figure 2 describes the process of generating correlations. Determining correlations between the facets is via the Apriori algorithm by taking the indexed database BD = (d1 ... dn) and the sets of facets F?{Fmo? Fmu} as inputs. We obtain as a result the most frequent itemsets (facets) and that will be used later to determine the correlation between tags. Indeed the correlation of the facets must be respected in the generation of facet-tags.

For example, if we obtained after step 1 a correlation between a facet F1 and a facet F2, we consider that each of these facets must be present in the generation of itemsets facets and associated tags.

Figure2.  Correlation of facets and tags  Since there are two types of facets Fmo and Fmu, we improve this algorithm by exploiting this feature of facets to minimize the computational cost. This optimization is built into the stage of joining itemsets. After the generation of frequent itemsets, we do not link tags belonging to a single facet monovalued because these combinations are prohibited by the setting of the facet, and they will not produce rules until the user cannot simultaneously choose his/her tags to classify the document.

C. Recommendation Algorithm   Definition. We consider f(t)  as the set of facets and tags selected by the user u ? U to classify its document d ? D. The knowledge base is defined by a set of association rules AR.

Each AR is defined by a peer (A, C) where A is the antecedent part and C is the consequence of the AR.

When the user selects the first tag, the system verifies whether the AR has an antecedent part  f(t). If one or more rules exist then the system suggests to the user a set of f ?(t?) where f(t) ? f ?(t?).

Algorithm Input : ?(??) , {??}    Output : ??(??) Begin  1. ??(??) = ? 2. Find the set ?? of rules ??? = ???, ??? where ?(??)  ? ?? 3. For each rule ? = (?, ?) ? ?? do  ??(??) = ??(??) ? C  End     Otherwise the system does nothing. The query process of AR is based on repetitive process each time the user tags his/her document. We provide the algorithm of recommendation in the next section.

If we suppose that the user has chosen f (t) = Type of  document (Report), the recommendation system checks the rules in the database if there is one or more rules as part antecedent containing f (t).For example, if we have in the base of the AR following rule:  Type of document (report)?Activity (Meeting) + Project (ANR)  The recommendation system will suggest to the user in the first time the facets and Activity Project. Once the user has validated the proposed project facet, the system proceeds to the next level of recommendation to provide the tag ANR. In the next section, we explain the process of recommendation based on association rules in a KOS faceted system.



IV. HYPERTAGGING The main functions of Hypertagging are storage (naming,  classification), treatment (research) and communication (sharing).

The functions of capture and creation of documents resources are not included in Hypertagging, there documents are either created by individual tools or collective, accessible workstations as Office suite, CMS (Content Management System) ... or acquired from external systems through web browsers.

Structuring elements of Hypertagging are conceptual and functional graphs, which represent a GUI with which the user can classify a document by simply "clicks". These elements can be Views, dimensions and tags:  Views allow classifying individually or collectively dimensions. This classification is based on mental users? classifications in different contexts. "Product" and "Clients" are examples of views in a commercial enterprise. Each view contains one or more dimensions. These are similar to classes (in the sense of classification) and contain multiple values.

These values are the tags, represented as icons.

A dimension can appear in multiple views. It can be multi- valued (the user has set for it several tags) or single-valued  (limited to a single tag). Compared to the collaborative aspects, a dimension can be individual or shared. It can contribute to the naming of a document (in the case where the user chooses that this dimension name appears in the naming of the document).

The description of a document is based on the tags, the values of a dimension. Tags are injected as document metadata.

Metadata is a fundamental component of the conceptual document classification. They are among the main concepts of the prototype Hypertagging, necessary to support the search functions of classified documents. There are two solutions to associate metadata to resources: internally and externally method.



V. CONCLUSION   In this paper, we develop a new approach for automatic recommendation of facets in our KOS Hypertagging for documentary ranking. Our model can learn over time the habits and preferences of users via the operating trace of indexing. This approach allows for easier indexing of documents to the user by suggesting recommendations that meet their needs and expectations. We believe that cold start problem is an important issue that we should deal with.

The applied approach of recommendation makes hypothesis that users have enough tagged documents with facets and tags to allow the system to learn and start the process of recommendation.

The perspectives of this work aim to extend this recommendation technique in a document sharing environment and facets-tags in a group of users. To conclude, our approach differs from other existing works on recommendation by proposing a new model of association rules including a facet level added to the tags level.
