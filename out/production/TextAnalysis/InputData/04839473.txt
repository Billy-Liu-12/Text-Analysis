Abstract?Accurate estimation and compensation of the moving target Doppler shift are essential for the moving target detection of the airborne radar system. In this paper, an algorithm for the real-time estimation and compensation of the moving target Doppler shift due to the moving radar platform and target is presented for the airborne stepped frequency radar system. Under the condition of a small number of sample points, this new algorithm employs the twice compensation method in order to estimate and compensate the mean Doppler shift using high speed DSP based on Doppler FFT processing. Using simulated radar data, the moving target Doppler spectrum is measured and analyzed. The results of simulations show that this new algorithm can reduce the number of sample points and enhance the anti-interfering performance yet still obtain good Doppler estimation and compensation.
