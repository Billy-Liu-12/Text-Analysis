I. INTRODUCTION Water conservancy industry has a long history in China.

With the rapid development of natural economy, hydraulic engineering is playing a more and more important role in national economy and flood control has become a crucial and direct affecting aspect in it. Due to the low level of informational flood control, the previous artificial observation data have big errors and maintenance difficulties, leading to great losses. Currently, China aims to carry out digital water conservancy and a comprehensive real-time monitoring system over large reservoirs by means of remote video. Thus, flood control gradually transfers from a passive one to an active one. To further enhance the effectiveness and reliability of flood control, remote video monitoring system of flood control is needed and it can do dynamic monitoring on the flood, danger and disaster timely, knowing the situation at any time, and thus taking appropriate preventive actions and remedies to ensure a safe operation of reservoirs. It plays an important role in leadership decision, in reducing flood damage, easing the pressure on the city's flood protection, and protecting people's lives and property.

Digital video surveillance system[1] is a new type of surveillance system, using digital image processing system as core technology[2][3][4],comprehensively making use of photoelectric sensor, DSP[5][6][7], computer network, and automatic control technology. Apart from all functions of  traditional CCTV surveillance system, this system also has functions like remote video transfer and playback, automatic anomaly detection and alarm, and structured video data storage.

Compared with the traditional analog control, digital video surveillance has many advantages:  ? Easy access to computer processing ; ? Fitness for long-distance transmission.

? Easy way to find information and index.

? Improvement of image quality and control efficiency.

? Convenience for system management and  maintenance.

? Several applications can be parallelized by means of  some dependent tasks [11]

III. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF VIDEO MONITORING S DESIGN  A. system program design Video monitoring and tracking system for moving target  needs to accomplish these: video signal?s acquisition, decoding, storage and data disposal. Therein, the case of the system is to realize the real-time monitoring and tracking algorithm of the video moving target. Consequently, choosing an appropriate image processing chip is really important.

1) Elections of the image chip ADV7181[8] is an integrated video decoding Chip  produced by ADI company. It can identify and switch the analog video signal of standard BW automatically, for example, the NTSC and PAL analog signal. They can be switched into eight-digit or sixteen-digit number: CCIR601/CCIR656. Their sampling formats are the signals of 4:2:2 or 4:1:1. ADV7181 has high-level, rapid and flexible digital output interface which can help a lot in video monitoring and switching in the system that based on frame buffer and line locking, clock locking. Therefore, the Chip is in wide application in different analog video signal.

The advantages of adopting ADV7181 Chip to fulfill the acquisition function of the digital video image are:  ? Output of constant amount of line picture element; ? Low power consumption (<0.5W 3.3V), small  capacity, and low cost; ? Easy control (I2C highway ), and flexible allocation; ? Corresponding sample program offered by ADI.

2) Elections of the digital memory chip From signal?s acquisition to algorithm?s realization, the  memory Chip of definite capacity volume is needed to store the original or the intermediate data. As BF533 has many outside-setting interfaces, this essay chooses SDRAM to store data and DPRAM to store character superposed data.

DPRAM, the dual ports RAM, has two independent addresses -- data wire and read-write control line. Its control logic and accumulator have been integrated in an electric circuit which has been widely integrated. Realizing the true dual ports asynchronous operation enables itself to be linked with many kinds of CPU ports and also it simplifies the electric design, increases the integrated level, and quickens data exchanging. Thereby, it can be used to store character superposed data that will be offered to the succeeding electric circuits.

3) The results of systematic analysis  - 433 -    Figure 6. Design system  CCD camera collects video signals, ADV7181 decodes and stores the signals, and CPLD accomplishes the functions of character superposed outputting.

From all the analysis above, the design system flow Figure is what Figure 6 shows.

The contents in the flow Figure include: ? Image acquisition module: made up of CCD and  ADV7181 and being used to finish the acquisition of video signals;  ? Data memory module: including SDRAM, FLASH and DPRAM, thereinto, SDRAM is used to store the acquired video signals and the intermediate data produced in the operational process and so forth.

DPRAM is used to store the character superposed data. And FLASH is used in DSP?s upper load-on program;  ? Data-processing module: consisting of DSP and its surrounding memory module and it is used in video storage;  ? Video character superposed module: LM1881 separates video signals? line and field lockage signals and CPLD fulfils the function of character superposing.

? Communication control module: fulfilling the data communication function between the subsystems and PC through UART.

B. Data acquisition module?s design Data acquisition module is composed of Sony company?s  CCD CAMERA, ADI company?s ADV7181 Chip and ADSP-BF533?s PPI. Its principle is to make use of CCD CAMEREA to collect video image?s analog signals in time; ADV7181 has six ways of inputting, but it just adopts one as the input signals, and then it will make use of ADSP- BF533?s programmable PF foot to allocate. I2C is the bus standard. As for analog signals, ADV7181 makes A/D exchange and acquires digital video signals, and then it transmits the digital video signals to SDRAM through DSP?s PPI port  in a way of two-dimension DMA. Its electric circuit principle can be showed in Figure 7:  C. Data momery module?s design ADSP-BF533 memory module[12][13] can be divided  into three parts: SDRAM, DPRAM and FLASH.

SDRAM  According to BF533[9][10] memory space allocation, each memory unit address is:  DPRAM 0x201fffff 0x20100000; FLASH 0x200fffff 0x20000000; SDRAM 0x07ffffff 0x00000000.

The design and linking chart of BF533?s outer  accumulator--- SDRAM is showed as the following Figure 8 shows:  D. Communication control module?s design Communication control module answers for the video  digital information?s transmission between computer and signal card. It mainly adopts BF533?s UART?s port[14][15].

Because design of code needs a great amount of debugging work, deriving digital information from BF533?s memory space through JTAG port often takes much time, for example, 25 frames? pictures need half of an hour. Taking advantage of UART port can greatly shorten the time and in the succeeding design it can also make use of URAT port to link the system and the local monitor in order to succeed local digital communication, including RS232 and RS485. The linking block diagram is showed in the following Figure 9:

IV. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CONTROL SYSTEM?S DESIGN  According to the former introduction, the control system is used by the customers to realize the managing function.

With a view to the commonality of every module in the video monitoring system, Figure 10 shows the circuitry of the control system:  - 434 -    Figure 9. Communication control module?s design  Figure 10. Video monitoring system  The contents in the flow chart: ? The customer limiting surface module. The module  consists of DSP, CPLD and the surrounding memory circuits and it is used to realize the diversified needs of the customer limiting surface. Thereinto, DSP, the main part of the system, is used for various customer limiting surfaces? composing. CPLD sees to the switching of the key control limiting surfaces, and the dial-up disjunctor.

? The communication module. The communication module of the control system can be divided into two parts: UART(RS232 RS485) and SPI concentration line. Thereinto, UART will put into effect the asynchronous communication function between the system and the outside. SPI concentration line will realize the communication among the control system and other subsystems.

? The acquisition module. In the monitoring system, customers are often sensitive only to some important fields. Therefore, special institution should be made.

Adopting the man-machine interactive method, customers can choose those fields that they are interested in on the limiting surface and also just make anomaly examination and video analysis on the appointed field. In response to demands, it can also implement the flexible warning function.
