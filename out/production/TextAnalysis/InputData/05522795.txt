A New Method for Eliminating Redundant Association Rules

Abstract?As one of the fundamental data mining methods, the association rule mining has widely been used in many fields.

However, the existence of massive redundant rules has made the analysis very difficult, and has been a main barrier to efficient utilization of discovered association rules. This paper studies the characteristic of commonsense knowledge which is use to eliminate redundant association rules, and analyzes the impact of commonsense knowledge and the special rules whose confidence is 100% on the generation of redundant rules. Some theorems and corollaries of redundant rules are proposed and a new method for eliminating redundant rules based on these theories is proposed. This new method can prune some redundant rules by using commonsense knowledge and the special rules without calculating confidence, so it improved the efficiency of mining and the utilization of discovered association rules.

I.  INTRODUCTION Association rule mining was proposed for the first time  in 1993 [1], and today this method as a prominent data analysis tools has widely been used in many fields such as network intrusion detection [2], customer relationship management [3], analysis of traffic accidents [4], medical diagnosis [5], protein structure analysis [6] and so on.

However, the existence of massive redundant rules has made the analysis very difficult, and has been a main barrier to efficient utilization of discovered association rules. Many meaningless rules are easily generated even with a high support and confidence threshold [7]. This paper is concerned with the following two types of meaningless rules: firstly, some rules correspond to the prior knowledge, thus they are meaningless for end user to make decisions [7].

This kind of rules is called the first redundant rule in this paper. Secondly, some rules are considered to be meaningless when the information or knowledge conveyed in which corresponds to or is covered by other discovered rules [12]. This kind of rules is called the second redundant rule in this paper.

Many previous works have paid attention to eliminate redundant rules. The method using metadata information to eliminate redundant rules was proposed in [8]. The methods using semantic knowledge to eliminate redundant rules were proposed in [9][10]. The methods for eliminating the second redundant rules were proposed in [11][12][13][14][15].But  those studies don?t consider the following questions: Which kind of prior knowledge can be used to eliminate redundant rules? What is the characteristic of this knowledge? What is the impact of this kind of knowledge or the special rules (in this paper, the ?special rules? refers to the discovered association rules whose confidence is 100%) on the generation of the second redundant rules? Based on those questions and research results mentioned above, this paper proposes a new method for eliminating redundant rules by using commonsense knowledge and the special rules.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2, this paper presents a brief introduction of association rule mining. In section 3, this paper presents the characteristic of commonsense knowledge and some theorems and corollaries of redundant rules. In section 4, a new method for eliminating redundant rules is proposed in detail. In section 5, a practical example proves the effective of this new method, and then conclusion is described in the last section.



II. ASSOCIATION RULE MINING The association rule mining task can be stated as follows:  let D be a transaction dataset, and let 1 2 3, , ... nI x x x x  i   be the items appear in the dataset. We denote an itemset contains i items as X x i where x X . We denote transaction set, in which each transaction contains itemset X , as , note that  ( )t X ( ) ( ) ( )i it X t x t x  ( )t X ( )i i  ,i.e., the transaction set can be generated by intersection operation of  transaction set t x ,where x  is the each item in itemset X .We use the notation t X  to refer transaction  set is the subset of  ( ) ( )i jt X  ( )it X ( )jt X . We use notation D  to refer the number of transactions in the dataset, use notation  ( )t X to refer the number of transactions that contain itemset X .

An association rule is an expression A B , where A(B) is an itemset. Two important constraints of association rule mining are support and confidence [1], where  ( ) sup ( )  t AB port A B  ( ) ( )  ( ) t AB  confidence A B t A  , . An D   DOI 10.1109/ICICTA.2010.129       association rule is considered to be a strong rule if and ,  where min_sup and min_conf are user-specified minimum thresholds. More detailed instructions about association rule mining methods can be found in  sup ( ) min_ support A B ( ) min_coconfidence A B nf  [12][16]

III. REDUNDANT ASSOCIATION RULES  A. The First Redundant Rules Rules are considered to be no interesting if they  correspond to prior knowledge [7]. Commonsense knowledge is one kind of prior knowledge, and has following characteristics: I) Necessity: If the antecedent of knowledge occurs the  consequent of knowledge will inevitably occur and the consequent has the unique value. This characteristic can be expressed in the form of association rule like  , where CK.A stands for the antecedent of commonsense knowledge; CK.C stands for the consequent of commonsense knowledge. CK.A and CK.C may be a (an) concept (behavior, object, attribute) or a (an) concept (behavior, object, attribute) set.

( . . ) 100%confidence CK A CK C  II) Correctness: The probability that CK.C occurs given that CK.A has occurred is 100%, and in most case, this value is correct.

III) Universality: Commonsense knowledge is widely known, or in some professional fields, it is familiar for the most of users in those fields.

Commonsense knowledge is widely accepted as correct, it may be the axiom, the theorem, the relationship between the object and its essential attribute, or the accumulate experience that has be proved to be right by practice and so on. For example,  are all commonsense knowledge.

Definition 1 Rule A B  is the first redundant rule if and.A CK A .B CK C .

B. The Second Redundant Rules If all the rules in a collection R have the same support  and confidence, the simplest rules in the collection should suffice to represent the whole set. Thus the non-redundant rules in the collection R are those most general, i.e., those having minimal antecedents and consequents [12] , and the other rules in the collection are redundant rules. Three theorems about the second redundant rules are proposed as follows.

Theorem 1: If  then the rule  confidence A X AX B  is equivalent to the rule A B  and is the  second redundant rule.

Proof:  If , it means that X always occurs in the transaction where  occurs, put another way, the transaction set where A  occurs must be a subset of the transaction set where X occurs. This is can be given as  confidence A X A  ( ) ( )t A t X [12].

IV. A NEW REDUNDANT RULE ELIMINATE METHOD Based on the theorems and corollaries proposed in  section 3, a new method for eliminating redundant association rules is proposed in detail in this section. This method can eliminate two kinds of redundant rules by using commonsense knowledge and the special rules without calculating confidence (as shown in Figure 1).

Step1: Preprocess data and find all frequent itemset using Apriori algorithm method.

Step2: For each frequent itemset , judge whether can generate redundant rule with commonsense knowledge and the special rules  Step3: If a frequent itemset will not generate redundant rules then calculate confidence and output strong association rules and store the rules whose confidence is 100% into the RB, where RB stands for Rule Base which is used to store the special rules.

Note that the simple commonsense knowledge such as the hierarchical relationship among objects, or the attribute relationship between an object and its attribute can be inferred by using domain ontology (ontology is a formal representation of a set of concepts within a domain and the  relationships between those concepts. It is used to reason about the properties of that domain, and may be used to define the domain [17]) and inference rules. The other complex knowledge can be inputted by users .Both two kinds of commonsense knowledge are stored in KB, where KB stands for Knowledge Base which is used to store commonsense knowledge.

Figure 1 A new method for eliminating redundant rules  The redundant rule eliminate algorithm is the core part of this new method, and can be described as follows.

Algorithm: Generate non-redundant association rules Input: Lk min_conf, KB, RB  //Lk is frequent k-itemsets; Output: non-redundant association rules Method: RB ; for each Kl L  {      // l  is a k-itemset in LK.

for each s l  {      //  is the subset of l . s if (! ( , , )RedundantRuleJudging l s KB ) then{  if RB  then ( , ,min_ , )GenerateRule l s conf RB ;  else if (! ( , , )RedundantRuleJudging l s RB ) then ( , ,min_ , )GenerateRule l s conf RB ;  }       } }  ( , , )RedundantRuleJudging l s base //Judge whether itemset l will generate redundant rules.

boolean flag=FALSE; for each r in base {  //r is a commonsense knowledge or a special rule //stored in base.

if   . .s r antecedent r consequent  flag=TRUE; if  . .l s r antecedent r consequent  flag=TRUE; if ( .s r antecedent ) and ( .r consequent l s )  flag=TRUE ; return flag;  }  ( , ,min_ , )GenerateRule l s conf RB //generate strong association rules and store the rules whose //confidence is 100% into RB.

RULE r=new RULE (); //instantiate a new rule.

if ( ) min_  ( ) t l  conf t s  then{  .r antecedent s ;  .r consequent l s ;  .sup ( )r port t l ;  ( ) .

( ) t l  r confident t s  ;  output r ; if  then . 100%r confidence  add r into RB; }

V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULT We performed the experiment on real datasets which are  from the fraud cases database (2007-2008) of city Y .The confidence threshold was set to 65%.Figure 2-3 show the effect of pruning for the discovered association rules.

We have got the commonsense knowledge that ?in city Y, region A and region B both are the city proper?. Among rule 14-16(as shown in figure 2), rule 15 is identified to be redundant rule according to Corollary 1; and rule 16 is identified to be redundant rule according to Corollary 3.

Both of them should be eliminated.

Region=B 504 ==> Criminal Motive=covet wealth Region Attribute = city proper 493    conf :( 0.98)  Figure 2 Rule 14-16  Because rule 5 has the confidence of 100%, among rule29-31 (as shown in figure 3), rule 30 is identified to be redundant rule according to Theorem 1, and rule 31 is identified to be redundant rule according to Theorem 3 .

Both of them should be eliminated.

VI. CONCLUSIONS This paper mainly studies the characteristic of  commonsense knowledge, and then analyzes the impact of commonsense knowledge and the special rules on the generation of redundant rules by giving three theorems and three corollaries. A new method for eliminating redundant rules is proposed. This new method can prune redundant rules by using commonsense knowledge and the special rules without calculating confidence, so it improved the efficiency of mining and the utilization of discovered association rules. In the end, this method was proved to be effective by a real experiment.
