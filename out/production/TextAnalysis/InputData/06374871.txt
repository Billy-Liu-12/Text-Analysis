I.  INTRODUCTION Common e-commerce systems of book sales at present  have not been able to recommend potential books of interest to customers efficiently. If customer-oriented book information is not available, customers can easily form the motive of turning into other web sites. This article applies the association rules to individualized recommendation system for e-commerce business systems of book sales, simulates the sales force to assist customers on browsing online and purchasing, thus providing individualized service for customers.



II. FLOW OF INDIVIDUALIZED RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM FOR E-COMMERCE BUSINESS SYSTEMS OF BOOK  SALES BASED ON ASSOCIATION RULES According to the comprehension of Resnick and Varian,  the objective for individualized e-commerce recommendation systems is to provide customers with individualized commodity information and suggestions, helping customers decide the commodity to purchase, thus simulating the sales force to assist customers with accomplishment of the purchase. This article applies the association rules to individualized recommendation system for e-commerce business systems of book sales, using history purchase data of a particular period of time to form association rules, assists the system to provide individualized recommendation service to the customer. The procedure of recommendation includes four parts: data input, data preprocessing, mode analysis and online recommendation.

The procedure is shown in Fig.1.

III. DATA INPUT In the process of book purchase, the customer must go  through the procedure of registration, filling in customer information, login and filling in order to finish a deal. The system will record the data of each order in its database in background, and register the books by classification simultaneously. The information of customers, books and purchases assemble the data source upon which association rules and individualized recommendation based. The relevant information of data tables used in the book sales website is shown as follows.

A. Table of Customers? Information The data table of customers? information (users) is used  to store the information of all the customers involved in the system. The data type, size and description of every field are shown in table 1.

Table of Book Information The data table of book information (book) is used to store  the information of all the books sold in the system. The data type, size and description of every field are shown in table 2.

Table of Book Category The data table of book category (type) is used to store the  ID and name of all book categories, providing convenience for customers to search for books according to category. The data type, size and description of every field are shown in table 3.

TABLE III.  TABLE OF BOOK CATEGORY    D.  Table of Order Information The data table of order information (order) is used to  store relevant information about orders, in order to provide convenience for salesmen to process orders. The data type, size and description of every field are shown in Chart 4.

Table of Order Details The data table of order details is used to store the ID and  amount of books ordered by the customer, in order to provide convenience for the salesmen to process orders. The data type, size and description of every field are shown in Chart 5.

TABLE V.  TABLE OF ORDER DETAILS  Field Name Data Type Size Description Orderid Autocode 6 Order ID Bookid Number 14 Book ID Quantity Number 4 Order amount  The structures of all the tables above are used specifically for practical use, with diverse data structures unavailable for  direct analysis or calculation by a particular piece of arithmetic. The data must be preprocessed.



IV. DATA PREPROCESSING The data source used by association-rules-based data  mining is mainly from the table of order information. The table of order determines whether the customer will receive the ordered commodity punctually, so the customer will normally keep these data accurate. For the data accumulated from the orders, operations such as eliminating meaningless data, eliminating noise data, and transforming data formats are necessary for the realization of association-rules-based data mining.

A.  Elimination of Meaningless Data Meaningless data is the part of the data that would not  affect the results of data mining, but would decrease the efficiency of calculation. The meaning of association rules is  to discover principles like customers who has bought product A would also choose to buy product B, thus making an improvement on the sales margin. The deal  lengths concerned must be larger than 1, because no relevancy information could be found in an isolated order which has only one product. These data should be first eliminated.

B.  Elimination of Noise Data Noise data is the kind of data in the data source which  has direct influence on the results of data mining calculation.

According to the analysis above, the calculation of association rules is sensitive to the length of the orders.

Except for the lengths of the orders being longer than 1, reasonable maximum length of order may also be a concern.

Because the fairly concentrated maximum orders lengths may also be the length of maximum frequent itemsets, which may cost a long period of calculation time. To acquire the reasonable value of maximum order length, the fundamentals of the data source should be analysed.

The commodities in the order data are books, which have a considerable length of consumption cycle. To understand this principle, analysis must be made when the lengthy order situation is encountered. For example, ?join orders? is a constant situation exists in online shopping. ?Join orders? means several customers assembles a single order by purchasing books on each of their own needs. This situation appears when the web site offers promotions or a new method of payment. Lengths of this kind of orders would surely be longer than normal one-customer orders. If the reasonable value of maximum order length is calculated, noise data could be easily observed. Based on a survey online, the common customer order length is concentrated in the range of 1 through 4. Considering the recommendation would be in the form of bundle sale based on association rules, 5 is considered to be a valid boundary of noise data. In addition to practical data mining, only the situation with several categories of the book in a certain order is concerned,  Field Name Data Type Size Description Typeid Number 4 Category ID Typename Text 40 Category name     not those in which several identical books are ordered together.

C. Transforming Data Formats The data stored in the actual system concerned in this  article is quite formal. Customer IDs and order IDs are stored as long integers, book IDs are stored as characters, suitable for calculation. But before data mining, data information is needed to be converted into text. For convenience, order IDs are supplemented to 10 digits. If less, spaces are supplemented at the end of the IDs.

D. Realization of Data Preprocessing Recent book purchase records of a part of customers  added up to 2000 entries are extracted from the deal database. Information about the purchases are recorded in the data tables of order information and order details. The system only concentrates on the information of the purchases made by customers, so useless data or noise data is filtered out in the preprocess procedure. When processing association-rules-based data mining calculations, data sources in the database are arranged into format files for efficiency. The format files mainly include deal information from the web site. The system arranges the order detail data table, reserving the data fields of order ID and book ID. The actual file format is listed below in table 6.

TABLE VI.  AN IDEAL DATA TABLE FORMAT  orderid bookid 10000001 9787302224464 10000001 9787302226727

V. MODE ANALYSES  A.  Formation of Transaction Database The information of books in a preprocessed data table are  combined together. During preparation the data has already been sorted by the field ?orderid?, so the orders with identical ?orderid? are concentrated. The system uses a double-layer circulation to establish the transaction database. The database is shown as below.

TABLE VII.  TRANSACTION DATABASE  Orderid Bookid 10000171 9787302224464  9787302226727 10000174 9787302089773  9787111075660  9787302131328 10000185 9787302131338  9787801655011 10000189 9787506345040  9787802115288  The table shown below is intended to visualize the combination status of the data, while the actual transaction data are processed in the form of texts. Data tables resulting from the preprocessing procedure are transformed into TXT text files.

B.  Generation of association rules In this step, the occurrences of a single item appearing in  all the candidate sets and the same transaction appearing in files, i.e. the support rates of transaction, are counted. As frequent items being discovered, reliability rate could be calculated, association rules could be output.

Figure 2.  The Flow chart of Generation of association rules  The specific association rules output procedures are: ? Generate all the single items of the database from the  item sets from several transactions;  ? Calculate support rate;  ? Add the item with the highest support rate into the reverse sequence each time;  ? Arrange itemsets in each of the transactions;  ? Change the counter of the root-shared items;  ? Search for frequent itemsets using single items as tails;  ? Calculate reliability rates of frequent itemsets.

C. Formation of Association Rules Providing the calculation of association rules completed,  the file of association rules is formed. The file?s format is: the first column lists book IDs, the second column lists associated book IDs, the third lists reliability rates. The evaluation and gradation of the accuracy of association rules is based on reliability rates. With the same minimum support rates, the rules with higher reliability rates are thought to be more accurate.



VI. REALIZATION OF ONLINE RECOMMENDATION MODULES  Online recommendation is realized by a specially designed online recommendation module. Given that association rules exists in the database, rule tables could be  START  Sorting of transaction items  Change the counter of root-shared items  Calculation of frequent itemsets  Calculation of reliability rate of frequent itemsets  END  Calculation of item support rates     read directly to provide recommendation to customers. The actual realization of the recommendation module is in the form of active web pages. The recommendation modes mainly used are commodity bundle and TOP-N.

A.  Recommendation of Relevant Books When a customer browses the information of a book of  interest, the system visualizes its corresponding active web page to the customer, listing all its information in detail. A relevant book is also shown to the reader in order to promote bundling, e.g. showing the cover image of a relevant book on the information web page of a certain book. Discount information can also be added to the web pages in order to attract purchases.

B.  Number of Books Recommended The strategy is to order the rules by reliability of  association rules, and recommend to the customer only with the topmost several books with highest rate of reliability.



VII. CONCLUSION This article has applied the association rules in data  mining to e-commerce systems on book sales, and designed an individualized recommendation system on book sales.

Simulation results show that this mining algorithm has good results.
