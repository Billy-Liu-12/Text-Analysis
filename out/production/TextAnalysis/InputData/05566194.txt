Research on Network Security Situation Awareness  Based on Association Rule

Abstract?Along with the development and application of computer network, the network security and stability has become an urgent task. In this paper, a novel model of network security situation awareness is presented based on association rules algorithm. To aim at the shortcomings of the classic association rule (Apriori algorithm), some improvements are carried out on it and the improved method is applied into network security situation awareness. Through the data mining method, the association rules can be found for the reflection of large-scale network security situation. By the influence of the attack to the sequence of entropy, the association rules are divided into normal and abnormal space in order to do the clustering. In accordance with the clustering, the level of network security awareness can be obtained.
