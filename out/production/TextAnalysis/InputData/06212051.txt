Self-Organizing Decentralized Wireless Management through Social-Based Metrics

Abstract?Autonomic and distributed management requires the cooperation between the network nodes and the periodical exchange of network information between them. To increase scalability of the information exchange, network nodes need to be associated and grouped through an efficient set of rules, to minimize the amount of control messages flowing in the network. This paper proposes a community-based association between nodes, where nodes in a community are connected through social-based metrics. The proposed social-based metrics are able to join the network nodes through their characteristics and probable interactions, reducing the disconnection between nodes and optimizing the information exchange between them.

The obtained results show that the social-based metrics in- crease stability of the links and provide better resource aggre- gation, decreasing the required number of messages exchanged between nodes in a distributed management approach.



I. INTRODUCTION  The increasing use of wireless communications in mobile devices has doubled in size in the last decade. This tremendous growth has brought an accumulating complexity in manage- ment tasks [1]. The vision of decentralized management is seen as an alternative to the traditional management of a network with large size and variety of elements. With the ever increasing complexity, heterogeneity and dynamics in future networks, centralized management will not be able to scale.

The future management approaches need to be able to adapt themselves to the constant evolution of these networks and overcome the limitations through a tight coordination and cooperation between the heterogeneity of networks and nodes.

The current trend of decentralized management requires the embedding of management functionalities inside of the network nodes [2]. However, this embedding will require network nodes to have sufficient information to take network management decisions in an efficient and collaborative way.

This information needs to be then exchanged between network nodes, which may increase the network overhead to unbearable limits. Therefore, new approaches to organize the network nodes and determine the interactions between them for op- timized network information exchange need to be researched, enabling an efficient decentralized management.

This paper proposes the association and connection between wireless nodes in communities through social-based metrics.

To mimic the behavior of users and predict their interaction in the communications, the emerging concept of mobile social  networking [3] can be rethought for network management support. In mobile social networking, users access virtual com- munities and share their social interests between themselves.

Recent studies [4], [5] have shown how the social communi- ties are formed and grouped by interests providing helpful information in order to develop social-aware strategies for social networks problems. These concepts may be inspired on the understanding of, for example, how wireless communities can be structured so that the users can share their personal interests.

In this paper, through the definition of new social metrics, the nodes are self-organized into quality communities which improve their message exchange for the support of man- agement decentralization in wireless networks. These social metrics measure and predict the friendship between neighbor nodes, associated nodes and in the point of view of a com- munity, ensuring an optimized association link in terms of stability and dissemination efficiency. The results of the im- plemented social-based association in standard IEEE 802.11, developed in Network Simulator NS-3.9, showed that the choice of the weights for the three metrics has a high impact in the association time and the size and number of communities, and that they need to be carefully chosen. Moreover, the results also show that social-based metrics are able to improve the information dissemination, increase the stability of the links and provide better resource aggregation.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces the social-based association process on decen- tralized wireless management scenarios. Section III describes the proposed social-based metrics, and Section IV presents the obtained results. Finally, Section V concludes the paper.



II. SOCIAL-BASED ASSOCIATION PROCESS  The association process requires two phases: bootstrapping and discovery. From a single node viewpoint, the bootstrap will set up the initial information, e.g. nodes identifiers, initial management policies strategies, assignment of unique identifier, MAC address, BSSID, hardware capabilities. After the bootstrapping stage, the node is ready to start cooperating in the discovery phase (Figure 1) in order to identify the surrounding neighbors. We consider surrounding nodes the ones that can communicate with each other in the transmission range. In Figure 1, we have an example of the discovery process. In the first step, is shown node 1 reporting its presence978-1-4673-0269-2/12/$31.00 c? 2012 IEEE     to the surrounding nodes. After node 2 and 3 one aware of the presence of the first node, they can continue this discovery process, announcing the nodes that each one already knows.

After all nodes have shared their knowledge, it is expected that they all are aware of each other. The proposed discov- ery protocol builds and periodically updates the information about neighbors, which is performed through an extension of the 802.11 MAC signaling process (e.g Beacons, Probes, Associations/Reassociation and Disassociation) and a set of new Information Elements (IE)[6]. This information is used by the nodes to decide the best neighbor or community for association, according to the proposed social-based metrics (described in section III).

Fig. 1. Example of nodes discovery processes in three steps  The discovery process is based on continuous search for new nodes, or on the update of the information already collected through a signaling process that considers direct and indirect contact (e.g. transmission and reception of Beacons).

The gathered information is obtained from the information received through the IE Beacons, and is stored in local tables: Partial View Table, which contains information of nodes in the neighborhood; and the Known Nodes Table, which contains information about nodes found through others in a specified range. The information on each partial view entry is received from the node within reach and can also be updated according to topology changes.

Due to the limited operating range, the direct contact be- tween the nodes provides only a very limited knowledge of the network. Thus, it was required to introduce the Known Nodes Table that is built through cooperation between entities to spread the knowledge of its neighbors. The need for this table relates also to the fact that one of the social metric estimates the size and quality of the community to which the node belongs (See Section III). The table is filled according to the information present in the vectors Known Nodes encapsulated in the Beacon Information Element. This results in a more extended knowledge of the network, allowing the nodes to have more information on which to base their decisions.

Notice that a community is a set of nodes associated with each other, i.e, a community ensures that there is always an association path between any two nodes. This concept is important from the point of view of decentralized management since the routing of data between any two nodes is guaranteed in a community.

The communities are created and optimized in a distributed way, since each node is associated to the one it considers to be the best one in the surrounding neighborhood. In parallel,  the process of maintaining the community takes place, since associations are not ensured to be definitive. Each time a node is contacted by another whose social metric is higher than the one of its current association, it needs to signal the node which holds the current connection, indicating that it will end the association. Thus, the graph of established associations will include only the best connections in accordance with the proposed social metrics.



III. SOCIAL-BASED METRICS  Our model assumes a distributed ad-hoc mobile wireless network consisting of nodes that interact with each other through direct or indirect contacts, forming a fully connected network in the coverage area, where nodes have at least one common channel between their neighbors.

We define N as the complete set of nodes in the scenario:  N = {?? : ? = 1, . . . , ?} (1)  where ? represents the total number of nodes. In any given time instant, all nodes have a partial view of the network, i.e., the set of nodes in the neighborhood of a node ? (partial view of node ?) can be defined by:  V? = {?? : ?? ? N ? ? ?= ? ? ?(?, ?) = 1} (2)  where ?(?, ?) is a function that returns 1 if nodes ? and ? are neighbors and 0 otherwise. The subset of nodes associated with node ? can be defined by:  A? = {?? : ?? ? N ? ? ?= ? ? ?(?, ?) = 1} (3)  where ?(?, ?) is a function that returns 1 if nodes ? and ? are associated and 0 otherwise. Note that, ??,A? ? V? ? N .

In any given time instant, a node ? belongs to a community of nodes. A community of nodes is composed by nodes that are directly associated or have a multi-hop path between them.

The subset of nodes in the same community of node ? can be defined by:  C? = {?? : ?? ? N ? ?(?) = ?(?)} (4)  where ?(?) is a function that returns the identification of the community of node ?. Note that, ??,C? ? N and ??, ?A?? ? ?C?? ? ?N ?, where ?.? represents the cardinality of a (sub)set.

We propose social-based metrics, inspired by social net- works, to choose the best node?s association. The main idea is to use the knowledge obtained from interactions of each node and its surrounding neighbors, through the concepts of communities, density/quality of the friends and ?friendship? of nodes. We propose three complementary metrics: (i) Neighbor- hood Nodes Friendship (ii) Associated Nodes Friendship and (iii) Community Nodes Friendship. These metrics, described in the following sections, will be jointly grouped in a social- based association metric.

1200 2012 IEEE/IFIP 4th Workshop on Management of the Future Internet (ManFI)    A. Neighborhood Nodes Friendship  The purpose of this metric is to quantify the degree of ?friendship? between a node ? and its surrounding neighbors (V?). The node ? with more nodes (?friends?) in its neighbor- hood will get a higher ?friendship? indicator. The degree of ?friendship? between any two nodes is given by:  ??,? = ??,??  ?:???V? ??,?  ? ?V? ?+ 1  ?V??+ 1 , (5)  where ??,? represents the number of beacons received by node ? from node ?, and ???? represents the cardinality of the set of neighbors of node ?, i.e., the size of the neighborhood of node ?. The overall ?friendship? of a node ? can then be inferred averaging the ?friendship? between node ? and all other nodes in its neighborhood (V?):  ?? =  ?V??  ?  ?:???V?  ??,? (6)  B. Associated Nodes Friendship  The purpose of this metric is to quantify the quality of ?friendship? between a node ? and node ? to which it is associated: this is a 1 to 1 analysis that will take into account the quality of the association. The ?friendship? quality between node ? and node ? with an active association is given by:  ??,? = ??,? ? ??,? ??? , (7)  where ??,? is an estimation of the Signal to Noise Ratio be- tween nodes ? and ? normalized in [0, 1], ??,? is an estimation of the link stability between the nodes (defined below), and ?? is a metric that quantifies node ? available resources characteristics (such as processor, memory, storage, battery remaining and type of interfaces). This value is normalized in [0, 1] and is transmitted in the beacons between nodes.

The link stability ??,? is estimated by the ratio between the number of Beacons sent by node ? and those that were actually received by node ? (??,?) and the total number of beacons sent by node ? (??):  ??,? = ??,?  ?? (8)  The overall ?friendship? quality of a node ? can then be inferred averaging the ?friendship? quality between node ? and all nodes associated (A?):  ?? =  ?A??  ?  ?:???A?  ??,? , (9)  where ?A?? represents the cardinality of the set of node ? associated nodes, i.e., the number of nodes associated with node ?.

C. Community Nodes Friendship  This metric quantifies the quality of ?friendship? between a node ? and the nodes in the same community. The idea is to combine the size of the community (given by the distributed algorithm) together with the average overall ?friendship? qual- ity of all nodes in a community:  ?? = ?  ?:??C?  ?? , (10)  where ?C?? represents the cardinality of the set of nodes in the same community as node ?, i.e., the number of nodes in the same community of node ?.

D. Global Social Metric  The global social metric is obtained by performing a weighted sum of the three partial node ?friendship? metrics (neighborhood, associated and community). Defining ?? , ?? and ?? as the weights of the neighborhood, associated and community nodes ?friendship? metrics, respectively, it is pos- sible to define the global social metric as:  ?? = ??? ? + ???? + ???? (11)  where ?? + ?? + ?? = 1.

The influence of each metric in the quality of the associ-  ations, which will be studied in the next section, will define the value of the weights.



IV. SIMULATION RESULTS  This section presents a simulation study that evaluates the proposed metrics and its influence in the nodes? association process, their quality and the characteristics of the commu- nities that are formed. It also evaluates the advantages of the proposed adaptive beaconing mechanism. The evaluations were carried out in Network Simulator v.3.9 (NS-3) which uses scenarios with increasing number of nodes, modeled by various input parameters (e.g. 300s each simulation, random walk as mobility pattern, simulation window size proportional to the number of nodes and being these initially allocated on grid). The obtained results include the mean values of the results in independent repetitions with confidence intervals of 90%. The baseline approach to compare the social-based metrics association is the one where the node associates to the one from where it received the first beacon. In this criterion, the nodes maintain the association as long as it is in the coverage area.

Figure 2 shows the average management packets sent by each node during the simulation, with the number of associ- ation responses on the left side and the number of beacons on the right side. With social metrics (the same weight for each one is used), the number of beacons sent is significantly lower. On the other hand, it is also important to consider that the threshold for the association changes due to a higher social metric, which will have a strong contribution to the total number of associations performed. This factor approaches or separates the curves Assoc. Resp. according to its higher or lower values, respectively. The number of association changes  2012 IEEE/IFIP 4th Workshop on Management of the Future Internet (ManFI) 1201    is related to the threshold defined to avoid constant link changes due to slight variations of the Global Social Metric value. Moreover, the number of forced associations caused by social metrics aims to improve the interconnection of the nodes at MAC layer. In addition, it is observed that the social metrics enforce the nodes to associate to the best neighbor nodes, contributing to communities with better quality according to the desired weight on each social metric, which can enhance the performance of the network at the IP level.

Fig. 2. Evolution of the number of management packets sent  Figure 3 shows the number of communities that are present at the end of the simulation. As can be shown in the Figure 3, the nodes tend to glue in a single community, regardless of the number of nodes in simulation. This glue behavior is expected since all nodes establish their association link to the node with higher social metric in their vicinity, creating a decentralized quality community. We can conclude that ? ? exerts a weak influence at this level, resembling the behavior of (First Beacon).

Fig. 3. Evolution of number of final communities  In addition, the number of communities is mostly imposed by ?? metric. With regard to (First Beacon) association, it tends to split in more communities, raising the overall com- plexity in terms of decentralized management, but reducing the complexity inside each community.

These results show the benefits provided by our social-based metrics in terms of number of association and reassociation for the support of decentralized and distributed management.

Notice that this is extremely important to reduce the required  management information exchange between nodes in a decen- tralized management approach. Moreover, this social metrics approach is extremely useful for scenarios where the high degree of mobility is the main requirement. The social metrics enforce the nodes to associate to the best neighbor nodes, contributing to improve the communities quality aggregations and reducing the required reassociations. This enforces a higher stability on the associations and a higher efficiency in the distributed management process.



V. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK  This paper proposed a community-based association be- tween nodes to provide efficient management information exchange in the distributed management approach, where nodes in a community are self-organized through social-based metrics. The proposed social-based metrics have a positive impact in a distributed management approach, reducing the disconnection between nodes and optimizing the information exchange between them. The obtained results show that the social-based metrics increase the stability of the links and decrease the required number of messages exchanged between nodes when compared to the First Beacon (without social metrics) association. This paper represents a first step in combining social-based techniques into decentralized wireless management. This approach is very promising since it will enable the support of decentralized and distributed manage- ment in wireless and dynamic environments: the prediction of mobility and encounters will increase the stability of asso- ciations and will reduce the effort required for management information exchange between the wireless nodes. As future work, we plan to compare the proposed work with other approaches (e.g Wireless Spanning Tree), and experimentally validate in a testbed.
