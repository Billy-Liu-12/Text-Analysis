Agent-based Flexible Management for  Big Data Fusion Service on IRC Network

Abstract? A big data is now widely utilized in real-world situations. And the business field requires some cooperation or coupling between different big data systems. However, the big data system does not have a unified format and environments.

Thus, this paper presents an agent-based flexible management for big data fusion services. The proposed system utilizes an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) and a concept of IRC-bots. It may provide efficient data fusion services without a concern about the heterogeneous system.

I. INTRODUCTION Both a big data and a cloud computing are major issue in IT.

The big data does not have a clear definition. However, The big data is a various collection of data sets. And the collection may be large and complex to difficult the analysis and management. Hence, the big data also signifies a mining and an analysis technique for those data collections [1]. The big data already have an influence on various fields. For instance, the government publishes a new policy, and the company handles its own business services with the big data analysis [2].

Thus, the big data with the cloud computing is an indispensable part of the future technique.

Much study has been done in the big data issue. However, the issue is focused on the application such as 'how to use', 'how to manage' or 'how to analysis'. Thus, the big data system may handle a single case or very limited cases. However, the big data is open to further possibility of expansions, especially in business point of view. Various big data systems may be merged with each other to expand the service area. The expansion may increase a volume and a complex of the data collection. However, the enterprises may find a new business model, and improves their operating profit. In a word, the big data fusion is the unavoidable problems.

There are many kinds of the big data framework with the cloud computing platform [3]. It means; the big data system is on a heterogeneous environment. Surely, some system may be compatible with others. However, most of the system may  have different framework and environment. It will put chains on the big data fusion. Therefore, this paper presents an agent- based approach with a common communication network. We adopt the concept of the automated bot systems from the IRC network. It may provide a flexible management for big data fusion service. More detailed description is as following chapter.



II. AGENT-BASED FLEXIBLE MANAGEMENT ON IRC NETWORK  First of all, we describe both the IRC network and the IRC- bot systems. IRC is the abbreviation for Internet Relay Chat. It not only provides a live interactive Internet text messaging service, but also includes a data exchanging service [4]. This network may easily construct the communication system, and utilize a various purpose. In addition, IRC standards are also defined by the IEEE [5]. It means; we may implement the agent-to-agent communication without a new own design.

The IRC-bot is automated intelligent system and react to messages or events from others [6]. In general, the bot takes charge of something or other services for user on IRC network.

For instance, the bot may recognize a join or a part of other users. Moreover, the bot also understand some standardized messages, and provide timely services. Hence, we utilize this system and characteristics for our proposed agent system.

Fig. 1. Brief compoisiton of the proposed system   DOI 10.1109/CSE.2013.165    DOI 10.1109/CSE.2013.165     Fig. 1 shows the brief composition of our proposed system.

The system may establish several channels for services. And each channel represents a combined system with several other big data systems. Every channel has a managing agent for services. The managing agent handles a join and a part of the big data system from the combined system. And the big data agent takes charge of the spokesman for attached system.

Fig. 2. Brief composition and  communicaiton flow of the agent.

Fig. 2 shows the brief composition and the communication flow of the both agents. The big data agent contains the meta information (meta-info) for attached system. The information is composed of the metadata for service and commands. When the big data systems join some channel for combined system, the big data agent sends the ?JOIN? message and meta-info to the managing agent. And then, the managing agent adds the profile of the big data system and meta-info to storage.

When the user requests the services, the managing agent finds some appropriate big data system from the storage. And then, the managing agent sends the request to selected big data systems. As previously mentioned, the big data agent is only the spokesman for attached system. Thus, the big data agent contains the service translation module. It commands the actual service request to the big data system. The managing agent monitors the each big data system, and provides some result for users.

If the big data agent sends the ?PART? message, the big data system automatically leaves the channel for combined system.

As above, our proposed system provides the big data fusion services with the IRC network and the IRC-bot system.



III. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS This paper presents the agent-based big data fusion service  on IRC network. The big data fusion may expand and improve various services in IT and real world. We design the agent- based virtual fusion system on the IRC network. The automated bot system offers an easy method to manage a big data fusion system. The big data system does not do anything.

Only bot joins and parts from the channel on the IRC network.

Then, the managing system automatically reacts and handles the services for fusion system.

This paper just presents an initial idea, brief concepts and compositions of the system. Future works will present a detailed part of the system, such as the system registration management, the service scheduling or the fault tolerance.
