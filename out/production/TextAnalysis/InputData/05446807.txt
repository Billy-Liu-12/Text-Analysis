Abstract?This work introduces a flexible and reusable archi- tecture designed to facilitate the development of remote sens- ing applications. Based on it, we are developing a helicopter system, called Red-Eye, devoted to the detection, control and analysis of wild land forest fires in the Mediterranean area.

The design of the proposed system is composed of five main components. Each component will work collaboratively to constitute a platform of high added value. The general archi- tecture designed for wildfire monitoring is being tailored for two relevant objectives within the particular Mediterranean scenario: tactical day/night fire front evolution, and post-fire hot-spot detection.

The generalized integration of monitoring vehicles with the operation of other aerial resources (attack helicopter and air- planes) is an unsolved problem, both technically and method- ologically. However, the operation of a monitoring helicopter during certain very well identified phases of the extinction process in highly plausible. High-level strategic monitor- ing is possible because no-conflicts will appear due to dif- ferent flight levels; however, low-level tactical monitoring is a source of potentially dangerous in-flight traffic conflicts.

In addition to monitoring the fire front evolution, detection of remaining post-fire hot-spots located at the perimeter of fire is the main application that has been foreseen. Just after a fire front is contained or even during the days following the fire extinction, the monitoring tasks have to be maintained because of the danger of fire reactivation. The cost of moni- toring with ground teams or aerial means it is very expensive and consumes resources needed in other fronts or possibly concurrent fires. However, a helicopter equipped with ther- mal cameras, can flight over the area and generate a map of hot spots with higher precision at a smaller cost. It is cru- cial in this application that the hot spots are reported imme- diately to avoid having ground brigades waiting for data for too long. Also, it is important to feedback the information in such a way it can be effectively consumed, not forcing ground brigades to walk around the forest without a clear operational scheme.

Based on a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) [1] a heli-  2 IEEEAC Paper #1475, Version 1, Updated 30/10/2009.

borne hot-spot detection system is being developed. This pa- per describes the global architecture of the system, includ- ing the air segment, the ground control segment, and the in- terface with the squads operating on the fire area, etc. We also demonstrate how the available pre-defined modules in the SOA architecture have been reused to design this partic- ular application, the additional subsystems required to imple- ment specific hot-spot mission requirements, and the overall system / end-user interface.
