Big data Security Hardening Methodology using  Attributes Relationship

Abstract? Recently developments in network, mining and data store technology have heightened the need for big data and big data security.  In this paper, we focus on the big data's characteristic which takes seriously the analysis of value than the data itself. We express the relationship between attributes using nodes and edges. Through this, we propose a big data security hardening methodology by selecting ?protect attributes? from attributes relationship graph.

I. INTRODUCTION Because of the IT development, almost all of data in the  real life is processed by electronic information. To this end, a tremendous amount of digital information is being made daily [1]. In response to this situation, one of the most significant current discussions in information technology is big data. Big data has been utilized in a number of areas such as industry?s new profit-making, the basic data for government policies, medical information. Also the range of them continues to grow [1]. Thus, big data security is considered to be important. In recent years, big data security research has been actively conducted through data loss protection or access control, etc. [2]. In this paper, we focus on that big data have a many kinds of attribute than before and big data value is more important than the data itself.

Through these characteristics, we propose a big data hardening method using protecting for essential attribute of big data.

This paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we introduce the background of big data and its major application field. In section 3, we explain a big data security hardening method using attribute relation graph. In section 4, we provide a conclusion and future works.



II. BIG DATA OVERVIEW  A. The Definition of Big data Depending on point of view, there are many definitions for  Big Data. Big data refers to large data set beyond the capabilities of legacy database and management tool view  from the database side [1]. Big data is also being recognized as a trend and defined the new generation of technologies and architectures [1][3].

Big Data is commonly considered to new technology for very large scale data beyond the current database capabilities [1].

B. The Characteristics of Big data Philip Russom [4] defined the important characteristics of  big data are volume, velocity and variety. In general, the characteristics of big data are expressed as three Vs. But we focus on the volume, variety and analysis, in this paper.

? Volume: As we commented introduction, Information scale is the well-marked characteristics of big data.

According to IDC?s report [5], the amount of information created and replicated in 2011 would surpass 1.8 zettabytes (1.8 trillion gigabytes). Big data usually manage data from terabytes to exabytes unit.

? Variety: Big data use structured data and SQL as well as unstructured data and NoSQL. Because big data use unstructured data and NoSQL additionally, many kinds of attribute could apply to the analysis for creating value [6].

? Analysis centered: In big data, the data is compared to mineral. It means that value through the analysis is more important than the data itself. This feature is closely related to data mining [7].

C. Big data Applications Big data utilization area has been extended through  development of big data management technology like Hadoop and MapReduce [8] [9]. Big data creates value in various fields. Major fields are healthcare, retail, manufacturing, video surveillance, SNS etc.



III.  BIG DATA SECURITY HARDENING METHODOLOGY  A. Big data Security and Major View Point Big data is not a completely new technology and big data  security has a lot in common with information security. Big data security can be divided into data security and access control as well as information security [2]. But data  This work was supported by PRCP through NRF of Korea, funded by MEST(2012-0005861).

management and classification for security are more difficult than current information security due to data volume [5]. Thus, Cost per GB has decreased but security investment for big data has increased. In this paper, we aim to secure the value through the analysis of the data rather than the data itself.

Next section, we propose a big data value protection method using attribute and graph.

B. Big data Security Hardening Methodology Big data has various attributes and commonly generate a  value from relationship between attributes.

We propose a methodology to protect value by limiting the attribute. The proposed procedure is as follows. First, extracting all attribute of the target big data. Second, nodes are regarded as attributes and arranging in a circular. Third, if there is a relationship between two nodes, between the two nodes connected by an edge. Setting relationship based on the universal criteria and domain specific criteria. Universal criteria mean that two nodes have a hierarchical or interaction relationship. Additionally, in case of primary key exist, it include the relation on between primary key and other attributes. Domain specific is determined by own policies, depending on the type of big data. Next, select the protecting nodes by considering the number of edges. Finally, determine how to protect the selected nodes by policies.

C. Demonstration For more specific understanding, we assume that any  company's sales data for electronic products as follow table.

TABLE 1. EXAMPLE : ELECTONIC PRODUCT SALES DATA  Model No  Original price  Actual Transaction  Price  Time Buyer Ci ty Ho  ur D ay  Mon th  Ye ar  Gen der  A ge  ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?   1) All attributes are represented as circularly arranged  nodes.

2) Add the edge between the nodes that have relationships.

Relationships are as follows.

a) Hierarchical relationships : { H, D, M, Y} b) Interaction relationships : {ATP ? OP, H, D, M,Y} c) Primary Key : {MN ? all nodes except MN}     Figure 1.  Arrange the attribute node in a circle and Mapping the relationship  3) Select the protect nodes based on the number of edge.

Protect node can be one or group depending on the type of big data and policies.

4) Determine the security method for protect nodes.

Security measure shall apply to data for protect attributes, such as data encryption and access control.



IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK In this paper, we explained a big data and big data security.

We focused on big data value rather than data itself. Further, we proposed the security hardening methodology using attributes relation graph. Because big data have huge volume and need to security investment so much, we think that effective security method more important than entire security method for big data. We will study on the protected attributes selection algorithm based on big data type. Also we will study on the relationship extending method between the attributes.
