Understanding Ride-on-demand Service: Demand and Dynamic Pricing

Abstract?Emerging ride-on-demand services (e.g., Uber or Uber-like) are vying to penetrate into the market of traditional taxi service, and they are ubiquitous in the nature, by using smart mobile devices like on-car GPS and mobile phone. These ubiquitous services are also beneficial for the environment by increasing the utilization of cars and improving travel efficiency.

Through collaboration with a leading service provider in China, we are able to collect vast amount of accurate data and analyze the nature of the demand and dynamic pricing mechanisms that match the supply with demand. We consider the analysis as an important step towards making the ubiquitous service more efficient and beneficial to the sustainability of future smart cities.

We collect datasets of passengers? orders and payment in- formation, and focus on the analysis of demand and dynamic pricing. In demand analysis, we discuss its general characteristics, passenger grouping and demand clustering; in dynamic pricing analysis, we discuss the pattern and determination of dynamic pricing multipliers. Our findings pave the way for future study on system optimization, dynamic pricing and policy considerations.



I. INTRODUCTION  Ride-sharing services like Uber [1] have drawn increasing attention in many cities around the world. As a supplement, or rather, a substitute, of the traditional taxi services, ride-sharing service attracts customers by its convenience, cleanness and (sometimes) low prices, and attracts drivers who want to make money using their own cars in their spare time without the hassle of applying for taxi licenses.

This kind of services is ubiquitous in nature, with the use of cars (with GPS loaded) and mobile phones. On one hand, the use of these smart mobile devices provides ubiquitous access to the service itself; on the other hand, researchers could obtain ample amount of data from monitoring the use of these devices. Furthermore, by using these ubiquitous resources, these new services increase travel efficiency and car utilization, and hence become beneficial for environmental protection and sustainable development. Uber, for example, makes people drive less by providing convenient and affordable services.

Meanwhile, sharing rides from/to similar locations turn what would normally be multiple rides into one, saving fuel and cutting carbon emission. Uber claims that one of their services, uberPool, saved 674,000 miles in SF in just one month [2].

In fact, ride-sharing service is only one of the three cate- gories of ride-on-demand services, which is an analogy to the ?video-on-demand? that we are familiar with: users request for  personal rides as they wish. The 1st category is the traditional taxi service: cars are owned by the company and the supply is fixed; request is made by hailing, calling, etc.; trip fare consists of a fixed starting & unit price. The 2nd is ride-sharing service: cars are owned by drivers and the supply is dynamic; request is made from mobile apps; trip fare consists of both dynamic starting & unit price (e.g., the surge pricing of Uber fluctuates based on a function of supply and demand) and the dynamic pricing is embodied by a multiplier (e.g., a multiplier of 2x means that the starting and unit price are twice the normal values). The last category goes in between: cars are owned by the company and the supply is largely fixed; request is made from mobile apps; trip fare is dynamic. We call this category as CFDP (Company-owned-fleet, dynamic-pricing) ride-on- demand. This category is a response to people?s concerns of ride-sharing service?s safety and manageability issue, and meanwhile it retains the flexibility brought by dynamic pricing.

Compared to taxi, the core difference of the 2nd and 3rd  category is dynamic pricing, and this reflects the effort to manipulate the supply (i.e., the number of cars) and demand (i.e., the number of passengers): a higher multiplier (e.g., 1.5x) reduces demand and increases supply in a busy area, and a lower multiplier (e.g., 0.9x) does the opposite in a not-busy area. More specifically, in ride-sharing service dynamic pricing aims to bring more supply onto the roads when necessary; whereas in CFDP ride-on-demand it motivates surplus supply to flow from low-demand to high-demand areas.

Another difference of the last two categories is the use of mobile apps and GPS information to replace traditional meth- ods like hailing. This enables the GPS information collection for more accurate analysis.

A. Related Work  ? Taxi Service. As a traditional service, taxi has already been studied extensively, on the dispatching [3], schedul- ing [4], pricing [5], driver behavior [6], etc. There are also a series of studies from Hong Kong using a network model [7]?[9] to analyze different perspectives of taxi services. Studies based on real trip data are also available (e.g., [10]), after the NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission make their trip record data publicly available.

? Ride-sharing Service. Fewer efforts have been put on ride-sharing service. For measurement study, the only one  The First International Workshop on Pervasive Smart Living Spaces 2017     we can find is [11]. The authors try to evaluate Uber?s surge pricing mechanism based on the data they obtain in a black-box way. The dynamic pricing as an economic topic also attracts attention from economic researchers.

For example, [12] uses a case study to evaluate the effects of Uber?s surge pricing. [13] studies the ridesourcing?s usage and impacts by doing surveys from SF.

B. Our Study  Ride-on-demand service could make greater contribution to sustainable development only if they attract more passengers to use the service instead of self-driving, and this requires the improvement of system efficiency and passenger experi- ence. Researchers need to understand how the service runs.

However, existing researches focus either on traditional taxi or ride-sharing service, which either uses theoretic modelling (e.g., queueing theory) or analyze features of the service based on data not accurate & big enough. For CFDP ride-on-demand service, there is still not a detailed analysis.

In this paper we present some detailed analysis based on accurate data from a CFDP ride-on-demand service provider, which is necessary before going further to particular prob- lems/algorithms. The data could help us understand a service not studied in details before, and the results could also be generalized to other ride-on-demand services. This first step of evaluation would not only provide insights for the future de- sign of relevant mechanism in a data-driven way, but also help clarify some of people?s concerns about the service: whether the service provider is wickedly manipulating dynamic prices.

The contributions of this paper are twofold: ? We present the analysis of demand in the service, in-  cluding general characteristics, passenger grouping and demand clustering. The goal is to provide a basic under- standing and to lay the foundations for the more detailed study of ride-on-demand service in the future.

? We analyze the dynamic pricing mechanism in ride-on- demand service. This is the unique part of new ride- on-demand services, and our analysis concentrates on two problems: ?how does the dynamic pricing multiplier change?? and ?how is the multiplier determined??. This is beyond other similar studies on ride-sharing services.



II. DATASETS  A. Shenzhou UCar  The CFDP ride-on-demand co-exists with ride-sharing ser- vice in China, as a complement to tackle safety and manage- ability issues in ride-sharing. Our datasets are collected from Shenzhou UCar [14] in China, one of the largest and earliest provider of CFDP ride-on-demand service, covering more than 50 cities. It has a fleet of more than 30,000 cars, offering about 300,000 trips per day around China by the end of 2015 [15].

B. The Order & Payment Dataset  Each entry represents a single order from a passenger. It is created when the request for ride is accepted by a driver, and is updated when the passenger arrives at the destination.

Each entry contains the order?s boarding/arriving locations and time, the unique ID for the user (and the driver, the car, etc.), the type of order, the amount of money, the corresponding dynamic pricing multiplier and so on.

We collect this dataset from 57 cities in China, but in this paper we only present results for Beijing because of the limited space. Other metropolitan cities have similar results.

The dataset lasts for 4 months (from Nov. 2015 to Mar. 2016), and contains ?3.2 million entries for Beijing alone.

C. Map Representation  As we need to represent the order and corresponding payment information on the map of a city (in our case, Beijing) in a mathematically amenable way for analysis, we use the longitude-latitude coordinates in map representation, with the longitude and latitude as the X and Y-axis.

Fig. 1. The map of Beijing.

Fig. 1 shows the map of Beijing, captured from Google Maps, and Fig. 2 shows the map placed in Lng-Lat coordi- nates. Beijing?s urban express-way consists of 5 ring-shaped roads, from 2nd to 6th Ring Road, and the area inside 4th Ring is generally considered as the central part. The 2nd to 4th Ring Road is represented in Fig. 2 in green, red and cyan rings, and the innermost blue ring is the Forbidden City. The three green points on the upper right corner locate the Beijing International Airport, with the single point as Terminal 3 and other two as Terminal 1&2. A city usually contains multiple functional areas and we focus on three categories:  ? business area: the place for working. Different industries (e.g., financial or IT industry) may have different areas.

? residential area: the place for living. In China, some large residential areas accommodate ?10,000 residents.

? transportation area: Typical transportation areas include the airport terminals, railway stations for inter-city trains.

We choose some representative functional areas from our knowledge and use different shaded blocks for them in Fig. 2: blue, cyan & brown for business, residential & transportation areas. They would be used for validation later.



III. ANALYSIS OF DEMAND  This section presents the analysis of demand from three perspectives: general characteristics, passenger grouping based  The First International Workshop on Pervasive Smart Living Spaces 2017    116.30 116.35 116.40 116.45 116.50 116.55 116.6039.80  39.85  39.90  39.95  40.00  40.05  40.10  business area  residential area  transportation area  Fig. 2.

on demand and demand clustering by locations.

A. General Characteristics  We first do the most basic analysis and plot the time-of- day pattern of demand over weekdays in different selected functional areas at a 10-minute interval, shown in Fig. 3. The time-of-day pattern over weekends is also available, but is omitted in this paper. For each area, we show both the boarding and arriving pattern: the number of orders against the time of boarding and arriving at the destination.

# o  f o rd  e rs Business area  Time of boarding Time of arriving     # o  f o rd  e rs  Residential area  0am 3am 6am 9am 12pm 3pm 6pm 9pm       # o  f o rd  e rs  Transportation area  Fig. 3. Time-of-day pattern: weekdays.

We have the following observations: ? For business area, the # of orders arriving peaks at about  9am, and keeps relatively stable afterwards. The # of orders leaving the area peaks during [9pm,10pm].

? For residential area, the # of orders arriving peaks during [6pm, 10pm], and the # of orders leaving the area peaks during [8am, 9am]. The # of orders arriving at the area remains stable for a much longer time.

? For transportation area, the # of orders arriving peaks at about 7am and then remains relatively stable until 8pm; the # of orders leaving the area peaks during [23pm, 0am], and reaches the lowest during [2am, 9am].

We then focus on some statistics about passengers? trips.

Fig. 4 shows the histogram of trip time and trip distance for all trips. We also investigate the time and distance gap between  two adjacent orders a particular driver accepts (in Fig. 5) ? ?how long a driver has to wait?? and ?what is the distance a driver has to drive?? before taking the next passenger after completing the current one. The insights are:  ? Time and distance within an order: most trips are around 30 minutes and have a distance between 5 to 7km. The trip time and distance follow a Gamma and a power- law distribution, respectively. The fitting is omitted here because of limited space.

? Time and distance between adjacent orders: in most cases, the time gap is in the range [10min, 40min], and the distance gap [0km, 5km]. It is very rare to see a distance gap ?25km. This means that a driver has to drive for about 10 to 40 minutes (or, about 0 to 5km, in distance) before taking the next passenger.

B. Passenger Grouping  User profiling or grouping is useful and has been studied extensively in social networks and recommendation systems.

In the service we study, user (passenger) grouping is also useful in, for example, providing differentiated services to price-insensitive and -elastic users. An elaborate user profiling scheme may require analysis on a lot of user demographic or behavioral properties and is out of the scope of this paper.

We turn to an easier way: passenger grouping. We sort passengers according to the # of trips they take in each month, and call those top ones as frequent passengers when their # of trips add up to 10% of the total number. In Nov.

2015, for example, about 202,000 different passengers appear, creating about 800,000 orders. Among them, the top 1932 are frequent, creating 80,093 trips: about 1% passengers are frequent passengers, creating 10% of all trips.

Fig. 6 & 7 illustrate the need to group passengers by plotting the heat-map (i.e., places with deeper color have larger # of trips starting or ending inside) of the boarding/arriving locations of frequent and infrequent (i.e., the rest of passen- gers) passengers. The boarding/arriving locations are more  The First International Workshop on Pervasive Smart Living Spaces 2017    evenly distributed in Fig. 7 than in Fig. 6. In Fig. 7, only transportation areas have deeper color, and other areas have close and smaller # of trips. In Fig. 6, the contrast between hot and cold area is more obvious, and now transportation, residential and business areas all have deeper color.

Heat-map: the boarding/arriving locations for frequent passengers.

We also investigate the trip pattern of frequent passengers. It is found that about 53% frequent passengers commute between only 2 places for a whole month, and about 16% commute between 3 to 4 places (the exact distribution is not shown here). This shows that the trip pattern of frequent passengers is mostly routine and regular.

Heat-map: the boarding/arriving locations for infrequent passengers.

The insights are: (a) for infrequent passengers, the # of trips per capita is much lower and these trips are more randomly distributed, except in transportation areas; (b) 1% of passengers are frequent, contributing 10% of trips, and these trips are more geographically concentrated. Frequent passengers also have a mostly routine and regular trip pattern.

C. Demand Clustering  Demand clustering is based on frequent passengers? trips: to represent their regional characteristics. We apply the K- means clustering algorithm on all boarding/arriving locations, as shown in Fig. 8. The number of clusters is 20, and is chosen based on silhouette analysis. Each point is a single location and different colors represent different clusters. The centroids are marked by white cross-marks (i.e., ?X?).

Comparing Fig. 8 & 2, we find that centroids and clusters in Fig. 8 can accurately depict the functional areas of the city: clusters in Fig. 8 coincide with the selected functional areas in Fig. 2. In fact, according to our prior knowledge of Beijing, functional areas not shown in Fig. 2 are also accurately represented by clusters in Fig. 8. This shows that the clustering of boarding/arriving locations of frequent passengers is a useful way to identify functional areas of a city.

Apply a clustering algorithm (e.g., K-means) to cluster the board- ing/arriving locations of these trips. The resulting centroids & clusters show the locations of functional areas.

Step 2: Plot the heat-map for infrequent passengers. The most heated locations are transportation areas.

Step 3: To distinguish business with residential areas, plot the time-of-day pattern of demands during weekdays, as in Fig. 3.



IV. ANALYSIS OF DYNAMIC PRICING  Dynamic pricing is the core component of emerging ride- on-demand services. We focus on the its multiplier and analyze ?how does it change?? and ?how is it determined??.

A. How does the multiplier change?

We first consider the frequency of each multiplier in each day. The bound of the multiplier in the service is set to be [0.9x, 1.8x]. We calculate the frequency on everyday, weekdays and weekends, as well as the frequency of frequent passengers on everyday, shown in Table. I from left to right.

The insights are: ? The freq. of having a multiplier ?1.0x is ?60% in all  scenarios, and is about 85% on weekends. This shows that in the ride-on-demand service the overall price is  The First International Workshop on Pervasive Smart Living Spaces 2017    relatively low, and also justifies that a higher price is only used to manipulate supply and demand and is not frequent.

? The multipliers frequent passengers experience everyday is similar to the multipliers all customers experience during weekdays, instead of on everyday.

? The multipliers on weekends are significantly lower. One possible cause is Beijing?s traffic restriction: about 20% of private cars are not allowed to drive during each weekday. So more people choose to drive their own cars on weekends, lowering the demand.

We then investigate the geographical differences of multi- pliers during rush and non-rush hours. The city map is divided into N ?N blocks (each having a dimension of 500m?500m), and the average multiplier of all orders starting from each block during a particular time interval is calculated. In Fig. 9 to 11, we plot multipliers during morning rush hours ([7:30am, 9:30am]), evening rush hours ([5pm, 7pm]) and one non- rush hours ([11am, 1pm]). A deeper color represents a higher multiplier. The observations are:  ? In non-rush hours, most blocks have an average multiplier of 0.9x: in these blocks supply exceeds demand so lower prices are used to attract more customers.

? Comparing Fig. 10 with 9, in evening rush hours more higher multipliers appear in business areas; in morning rush hours more higher multipliers appear in residential areas. This can be explained by the time-of-day patterns we observed in Fig. 3.

? During rush hours, if a passenger is getting a too high multiplier (i.e., 1.4x or 1.5x), he/she could usually walk away for 1 to 2km to get a lower multiplier (i.e., 1.2x or 1.3x). This may not be clear from Fig. 9 & 10, but it is the result of our calculation.

Now we have showed the frequencies and the geographical & temporal distribution of the multipliers. Our next step is to uncover how the multiplier is determined.

B. How is the multiplier determined?

We first describe the dynamic pricing algorithm we work out together with Shenzhou UCar, which we also consider as a general framework for other ride-on-demad service (e.g., by changing the metric correlated to the multiplier). Then we discuss how to mine dynamic pricing areas from the change of multipliers.

A dynamic pricing algorithm. We denote the # of orders accepted on a particular location (a small area of 500m?500m) during [t1, t2] as S[t1,t2], and the # of orders rejected as F[t1,t2].

The percentage of orders accepted is:  R[t1,t2] = S[t1,t2]  S[t1,t2] + F[t1,t2] . (1)  R[t1,t2] is an indicator of the supply and demand condition: a higher value (? 0.8) indicates that the supply of cars is enough to satisfy the demand; and a lower value means the opposite and many orders are unable to find a driver nearby.

Assume the current time is t, and our goal is to pre- dict R[t,t+T ] based on previous Rs. To do this, we collect R[t?T?i?t,t?i?t], (i = 0, 1, 2, ..., N ? 1). We apply curve fitting techniques based on these N values and obtain our prediction of R[t,t+T ]. The choice of T , ?t, N and specific curve fitting techniques is out of the scope of this paper, as we want to outline a general dynamic pricing algorithm.

The whole city is divided into a number of dynamic pricing areas of varying sizes. A single area often covers a specific functional area and has a pre-defined function between R and multipliers. The multiplier of each location in an area is then determined by this function and the location?s prediction of R.

Functions vary across areas, to react to various user-experience guarantees. In a very busy business area, for example, the function is more radical, to guarantee that a price-insensitive passenger is always able to find a car.

Mining dynamic pricing areas. This is important as the partition is always done manually and may change irregularly due to planned events, change of traffic condition, etc. It also guides us in developing methods to automatically update dynamic pricing areas.

Fig. 12. Results from area-partitioning algorithm.

The basic idea is to compare the similarity of multipliers between neighboring locations and put the most similar loca- tions into the same area. We divide the city into N*N blocks, Bij . For a single time interval, we could calculate the average multiplier pij of all orders in Bij and all ps form a time series {Qij} when considering a whole day.

The area-partitioning algorithm (Algorithm. 1) has an input {Qij} and aims to assign an area index Aij to Bij : blocks with the same index form an area. We assign Aij to Bij based on the area indices of its neighbouring candidate blocks (? Cij = {Bkm|i ? 1 ? k ? i + 1, j ? 1 ? m ? j + 1}) and the similarities between Bij and these candidates. For two blocks Bij and Bkm, we define an indicator function ?km,ij(l) and it is 1 only when |{Qij}l?{Qkm}l ? 0.1|. The similarity Simkm,ij between them is defined as Simkm,ij = ?l=Ll=1 ?km,ij(l)  L , where L is the length of {Qij}.

In Algorithm. 1, some boundary conditions are not dis- cussed because of limited space. Fig. 12 shows an example result, with different colors for different dynamic pricing areas.

Areas smaller than 3 blocks are not colored.



V. CONCLUSION Ride-on-demand services are ubiquitous in nature by using  smart mobile devices (e.g., cars with GPS loaded and mobile phones). These ubiquitous services are, on one hand, beneficial for environmental protection, and on the other hand, amenable to data-analytic researches as ample amount of data is available from the monitoring of these devices. We dissect the dataset  from a leading ride-on-demand service provider and present our findings on its demand and its dynamic pricing mech- anism, hoping to provide clues in how to make the service more efficient. We hope our analysis and results could not only inspire more people to pay attention to ride-on-demand service, but also serve as a useful guidance for policy makers in considering the management and regulation of such service.
