High Performance SAR Focusing Algorithm and Implementation

Abstract?Efficient and fast processing of spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data is becoming increasingly important in many applications, such as surveillance and disaster recovery.

Moreover, constellations of satellites generate a huge amount of data, and standard toolchains may not cope well with them.

Dedicated architectures have been used in the past, but they are hard to maintain from both the hardware and software points of view. In this paper, we present SAR focusing algorithms for the COSMO-SkyMed constellation of satellites, based on es- tablished techniques, implemented using commercial massively parallel architectures: they allow an easy development cycle, while at the same time enjoying better performance with new technology advancements.
