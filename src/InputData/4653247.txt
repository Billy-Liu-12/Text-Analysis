Framework for Discovering Association Rules in a Fuzzy Data Cube

Abstract?This work presents a framework for the extraction of association rules from a spatial fuzzy data cube. First of all, spatial queries are executed to filter the information to be loaded in the data warehouse considering the spatial relationships among data. Later on, using the Mondrian tool a classic data cube is created and a fuzzy data cube (FDC) is generated from the first cube; by selecting the linguistic variable, the fuzzy sets are defined and a threshold that allow us to determine whether the transaction?s value belong to a fuzzy set or other. Once the FDC has been obtained, and also the information be ready to be mined, we use Weka tool in order to extract the association rules from the data. Finally, we apply the proposed framework through an case study: ?Analysis of risk zones of the Popocat?petl Volcano?.

I. INTRODUCTION  Nowadays, human beings could ask to ourselves What perception do we have about the world?, when we look around the landscape, automatically, we see a collection of objects or entities, that perhaps we call spatial objects like land?s parcels, rivers, etc.? or the eyes of the mind transform patterns and processes of the nature on mathematical models?[1].

Understanding the meaning of the patterns, it has been a task that have lead researchers to create new tools for manipulating spatial data, which helps to simplify the work of querying large volume of information. Given the requirement of make more efficient the management and preprocessing of spatial have came up computational techniques and tools to solve these tasks. One of these tasks is the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) [2], which allow us extraction of non trivial spatial and no spatial information, previously unknown and potentially useful from data. Basically, KDD consists of an interactive and iterative process comprising different phases for data mining.

This work is focused on spatial data analysis and exploita- tion coming from phenomena occurring over and under the world surface. Given their nature and complexity it demands for their interpretation a new mechanism of Data Mining, which is a fundamental part of the proposed framework. In section 2, previous works are described, section 3 presents the proposed framework, and finally, section 4 exposes a case study to validate this framework.



II. RELATED WORK  There exist previous works on the representation and manip- ulation of vague regions. The more representative is the Fuzzy Minimun Bounding Rectangle FMBR[3], which incorporates Fuzzy Logic to define degreees of membership according to a membership function evaluation. FMBR has been used to model spatial phenomena in many geographical applications.

The Fuzzy Data Cube[4] was defined first for a sales problem.

It is necessary, then, to extend this concept to consider the FDC generation from a spatial database. The treatment of the attributes semantic in the FDC is another approach which has been considered very few in the literature. This model helps to draw conclusions with a higher degree of certainty[5], which has been the main use of FDC. Data Mining consists of a set of data analysis techniques for extracting patterns, tendencies and regularities to describe and comprehend better the data [6]. Fuzzy Association Rules deal with the relation- ships between attributes and their surrounded environment like human reasoning does[7]. Spatial association rules describe the spatial objects co-occurrence intrinsic law, referring to closed neighbors association rule, union of limits and to the content of spatial entities. Essentially, association rules can be defined as it is indicated by 1.

X =? Y (s%, c%, D) (1)  where, s% and c% represent support and confidence of the rule respectively, D is the distance threshold between two spatial objects. If two spatial objects X and Y satisfy (X,Y) < D, then X, Y satisfy the relation.

A data cube specifies a fact table containing the analysis object of study. The facts are defined by a set of dimensions.

Dimensions describe the data cube as the same way like width, high and depth describe a geometric cube [8]. Association rules as knowledge representation techniques can be used to represent the existing relationships among data cubes dimen- sions [2].



III. FRAMEWORK FOR OBTAINING ASSOCIATION RULES IN A FUZZY SPATIAL DATA CUBE  In this section, we propose a framework for the extrac- tion of association rules in a fuzzy spatial data cube. This process involves a set of Technologies like GIS (ArcGIS), Data Warehousing (Mondrian, Cube Desinger), Data Mining   DOI 10.1109/ENC.2008.17     (Weka), Spatial Databases and Fuzzy Logic. Figure 1 rep- resents the steps to follow for the extraction of association rules; first spatial queries are carried out, then the filtered data is loaded and transformed to be integrated in the data warehouse. Information is transformed in a multidimensional schema (sharp or fuzzy) in order to apply data mining. The proposed framework focus on the extraction of association rules for making decisions like making predictions based on previous experiences.

Fig. 1. Framework for Obtaining Association Rules in a Fuzzy Spatial Cube  It is important to note, how is shown in Figure 1, that is possible to apply data mining from a sharp or fuzzy multidi- mensional structure. In the following sections we describe the steps for the implementation of this framework.

A. Specification of the Set of Spatial Queries  This step, which is the first of this framework, (see Figure 1), is one of the most important because of spatial queries will filter the necessary information for the integration of the fuzzy data warehouse. To compile this information, spatial relationships among data have to be taken in consideration.

1) Spatial relationships: Among the operations Spatial Algebra defines one of the most important are the spatial relationships which are classified in geometric, topological and directional.The explicit location of spatial objects defines implicit relationships with their closed neighbors, in a way that information related to them should be considered for spatial data mining. Respecting to spatial queries, it is necessary to guarantee flexibility, in doing so, an appropriate representation of spatial data is required.

B. Creation of the Data Warehouse  The design of the proposed data warehouse includes a process of filtering of data, known as ETL (Extraction, Trans- formation, Loading). ETL process creates an intermediate data repository, being one of the aspects that more effort requires.

In Figure 1, also is shown, how spatial databases are one of the inputs to the ETL process. Filtering information is  based on executing specific spatial queries in order to extract the information to be loaded in the data warehouse. This information need to be standardized and updated to avoid anomalies, such as redundancy, missing and incomplete data, allowing also the creation of keys. Then, data is loaded from transactional databases or intermediate repository to the data warehouse. As we mentioned before, the data cube represents a n-dimensional space, therefore, it is a suitable structure to represent in all its complexity spatial data. A critical problem about spatial data is the representation of the border, because it exhibits fuzzy characteristics. Therefore, different fuzzy sets compressing the border could be treated through dimensions of the fuzzy data cube.

C. Multidimensional Structure  A multidimensional structure represents an activity that is object of study and it is composed by dimensions characteriz- ing this fact, units of measures, which are relevant information about the fact, forming a data cube known as datamart.

Pentaho Cube Designer is used to create the classic data cube. This tool allows us to create an XML schema containing units of measure, hierarchy levels and dimensions. Moreover, this tool helps to select necessary attributes and execute join operations, facilitating the schema creation.

D. Fuzzy Multidimensional Structure  Fuzzy Set Theory, proposed by Zadeh [10], was used to create the fuzzy multidimensional structure. This theory allows us to model fuzzy data cubes containing fuzzy facts and dimensions. In general, the idea is to create a classic data cube and then a fuzzy data cube following the next steps:  ? Select the linguistic variable.

? Define the fuzzy sets and assign terms of the context  partition.

? Define a threshold,to determine membership to a set  1) Linguistic Variable: Variables that can take values from natural language terms like many, few, positive, negative, etc., which are words playing a role of labels in a fuzzy set[12], [11]. A linguistic variable is represented using linguistic terms, and interpreted as fuzzy numbers, a base variable, for instance: (temperature, pressure, high, danger, etc.). In Figure 2, each term of a linguistic variable represents a fuzzy set. At the top is the variable?s name, in the second level, we find the qualified terms that a variable can take, and at the bottom, partitions of the context, that considers ranges for each term, are established.

2) Fuzzy Dimension: The structure of the fuzzy data cube is similar to the classic, which consist on establishing the context of the analysis over the facts. In order to access different levels of detail, we can define hierarchies over dimensions, establishing as many granularity levels as possible. Each of these levels will be a set of names or labels, which define subsets of elements corresponding to the grouped elements of the lower levels [11].

Term2Term1 Term3  0 15 20 25  [0??15] [15..20] [20..25] Context  Domain  Linguistic Variable  Fig. 2. Linguistic variable  The difference is on: labels? levels that do not represent sets in a classic sense, but do represent sets from fuzzy set theory point of view. In this case, fuzzy sets are defined for each classic dimension and another fuzzy dimension is created containing terms of a partition context. In this partition, the element could be included in a set that defines to another and this implies a degree of membership associated with. Each element of the dimension, will have a level defining a fuzzy set for establishing its degree of membership. For each pair of levels, we have the relationship in the expression (2)  ?ij : Li ? Lj ?? [0, 1] (2)  Expression 2 allows us to define the degree of membership of the elements to their parent levels [11].

3) Fuzzy Facts: Variables of the domain in analysis, for instance: (sales, inventories, budgets) will define the facts in the data cube for the fuzzy case. Together with the facts, we include a value indicating certainty degree of the occurrence of this fact . Having more than one data source, it is possible that no all of them have the same level of confidence, then,we have two possibilities:  ? Consider data. This way we could be in risk to make strategic decisions based on possible incorrect external data.

? Omit data. The decision making process could be based on biased data.

The previous disjunctive deals with the problem of the importance of the information according its source and this way its influence in the analysis can be controlled. This situation can be handled using a fuzzy model through degrees.

In this way, facts having a lower degree will have a lower weight, but yet considering in the analysis.

A fuzzy set [11] consists on a set of attributes A1, ...., , An with domains D1, ....., Dn, let?s consider facts to any pair (h, ?),where h = (x1, ..., xn); in other words any n-tuple defined over the domains of the attributes, and ? ? [0, 1]. The value ? represents the influence of the fact in the posterior analysis, the more close to 1 the more influent or important the attribute is.

4) Fuzzy Data Cube: A fuzzy data cube will be defined by its structure, where a component represents fuzzy facts with a certain value; the others elements will be the dimensions characterizing these facts. A fuzzy data cube is a tuple C = (D, Lb, F, H, A) such that, (D1, ....., Dn) is a set of fuzzy dimensions, Lb = (I1b, ..., Inb) is a set of levels such that lib belongs to di,F = R ? ? where R is the fuzzy facts set and ? an special symbol, H is an historic object defined as A : l1b?, ....,?lnb ?? F , for each value of the dimensions it returns the fact related with this coordinates [3].

E. Extraction of Asociation Rules  Association rules are a formal way of expressing data patterns stored in a database. These patterns can serve to predict the data behavior produced by the fuzzy multidimen- sional schema proposed. Therefore, the patterns founded and interpreted, with the expert help in useful information, can assist in the decision making process. The intuitivemeaning of an association rule X =? Y is that transactions or tuples containing X also contain Y. Given an association rule, two quality rules measures are incorporated: confidence and support.

The rule quality is based on confidence (c%) for the rule X =? Y , which measures the percent of times that a rule fulfills when it is applicable. support (s%) is the fraction of the transactions in the database containing X and Y or the number of transactions the rule predicts correctly [2].



IV. THE CASE STUDY  The case study in this paper consists on to analize ?the Popocateptl?s risk zones and the surrounding counties and towns of the State of Puebla located in the skirts of the volcano?. The case study is developed according to the steps stated on the framework as seen Figure 1.

A. Creation of the Spatial Queries  For the case study, Popocateptl volcano, suppose we want to know which towns are directly affected by the lava flow or which ones are spatially related to. In order to get such information, the query consists of the process of selecting the lava flow and a buffer zone of 500 meters (towns that could be affected in this area). As we can see in Figure 3, the information returned from the query shows several points representing the towns that are on the lava path in the buffer zone. In other words, the results of the spatial query are transformed and loaded in to the datawarehouse.

B. Construction of the Data Warehouse  The architecture of the proposed multidimensional data warehouse is represented in Figure 4. The information of the Popocatepetl?s data warehouse consists of three dimensions named time, space and theme. For instance, the data repre- senting the lava flow and risk zone are stored in the theme dimension.

The architecture of the Spatial Data Warehouse is the bottom line for the creation of the data cube, together with     Fig. 3. Lava flow  People living risk areas  county  town  FMBR  Evacuation route  Day  week  month  quarter  year  danger description  risk_zone  region membership  T H  E M  E  SP A  C E  T IM  E  Population  Attributes  M ea  su rem  en ts  Fig. 4. Architecture of the Spatial Data Warehouse  their levels of aggregation and disaggregation respectively. The proposed data cube will be extended in order to define a fuzzy data cube.

C. Definition of the Multidimensional Structure  XML is used to represent, as a schema, how the information has to be represented in the data cube. Figure 5 shows the XML?s multidimensional structure schema: the name of the data cube, name of the fact?s table, the one will store the entire cube?s information, together with the hierarchical levels and the measurement units.

D. Definition of the Fuzzy Multidimensional Structure  In order to work with the fuzzy multidimensional structure, firstly it has to be defined the fuzzy dimension, which is defined with an expert (vulcanologist). The expert helps on to define the linguistic variable and the fuzzy sets. The linguistic variable, for example the risk zone, is defined according to Figure 2.

1) Definition of the Fuzzy Sets: According with the expert, there are defined three types of risk zones, high zone, medium zone and low zone. These zones keep a closed relationship  Fig. 5. XML schema for data cube  with the lava flow; based on that, the shape of the three membership functions is a trapezoid. The fuzziness of the information (amount of lava) and its capabilities to make a correct decision , explain the decision to work with such types of functions.

Fig. 6. Fuzzy sets for risk_zone variable  From Figure 6 the three risk zones can be obtained. These zones are represented as semi circles, in the state of Puebla.

The radii of each zone represents the degree of membership of each town to a risk_zone.The transactions contained in the data cube are shown in Table 1, considering the distance in kilometers from the volcano to towns that are associated with the risk_zone variable.

TABLE I TRANSACTION FOR risk_zone  Transactions risk_zone [km]  T1 8 T2 19 T3 12 T4 15 T5 23  The degrees of membership to the Fuzzy Set are calculated     using the definition given in Equation 3.

F (x) =  ?????? ?????  0 if (x ? a) or (x ? d) (x?a) (b?a) if x ? (a, b]  1 if x ? (b, c] (d?x) (d?c) if x ? (c, d)  (3)  Table 2 shows the results of applying the Fuzzy function (Eq. 3) for diferent values of risk_zone and the returned value represents the degree of membership to a risk zone for towns that are in such range. For example for T1 with risk_zone of 8 km, the membership function returns a highest degree of risk equals to 1.

TABLE II TRANSACTIONS DEGREE OF MEMEBERSHIP TO FUZZY SETS, USING F(X)  IN EQ. 3  Fuzzy sets T1 T2 T3 T4 T5 (risk_degree;High) 1 0 0.44 0 0  (risk_degree; Medium) 0 0.23 0.56 1 0 (risk_degree;Low) 0 0.77 0 0 1  Another way to estimate the degree of membership consists on to define a threshold ?, this value indicates whether a transaction belongs to some set. For instance, working with ? = 0.3, those transactions with a value less than equal to 0.3 do not belong to a given fuzzy set, then their degree of membership will be 0.

E. Association Rules Extraction  The Association Rules are obtained from the spatial datawarehouse using Apriori algorithm; which it is part of WEKA (A collection of tools that implement decision trees tables and rule learners,etc). By using the data cube is possible to generate the association rules like the one represented in expression (4). This rule helps to make the right decision with respect to the evacuation route that exist in towns close to Popocatepetl volcano, in case of an eruption.

COUNTY _IN_ROUTE ? x RISK_DEGREE ?High  ROAD_STATUS ?Good support =?  SELECTED_ROUTE ? x support confidence (4)  Suppose we consider unpaved road near a town with high population and high probability of seismic activity attributes, together with an advisory of evacuation; this situation could create a bottle neck, so we expected that our model will return an alternative evacuation route. INEG?s file containing Popocateptl seismic activity, was processed using the Apriori algorithm in order to get the association rules. The parameters of the Apriori algorithm are defined as follows: Confidence of 0.9 (high expectation), Support (minimum) [0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5]; based on these values we can reduce the number of rules and redundancy (See Figure 7).

Typically, it is desirable to generate only rules from frequent itemsets that are well-represented in the data. The minimum  Fig. 7. Association rules from Weka  frequent itemset support is a user-specified percentage that limits the number of frequent itemsets produced by the model.

A frequent itemset must appear in at least this percentage of all the transactions if it is to be used as a basis for rules.

TABLE III NUMBER OF RULES VS. MINIMUN SUPPORT  Support Number of rules Iterations 0.5 3 10 0.1 7 18  0.05 73 19 0.01 197 20  Table 3 shows that keeping high confidence equals to 0.9 and varying support, we can control the number of rules, and working with 10% the number of rules is reasonable. It is important to mention that instead of working with the nine attributes,that the file defines, were selected only five, attribute zone that represents the three risk zones previously defined, ashes_affect represents the level of ashes on the ground, vol- canic_material represents the level of fallen volcanic material such as incandescent stones, flow_path represents different trajectories for lava flow and flow_danger that represents the danger level. This reduction of the dimensionality in terms of attributes allows to the algorithm to find the most interesting patterns.



V. CONCLUSIONS  This work proposes a framework to model the geography according how it is presented in the real world, taking ad- vantage of the new information technologies. The concepts in which the multidimensional model is based on and the     Fuzzy Logic are complemented for the generation of the Fuzzy Data Cube. Data Mining techniques are applied to the information stored in the FDC, in order to extract the set of association rules, which define the behavior of spatial objects in their environment. Fuzzy sets defined in the FDC, allow to model spatial objects whose attributes have a certain degree of membership. Spatial and non spatial attributes can support the information related to vague regions. Fuzzy Logic is crucial in modeling vague regions since their borders are not sharply defined. In the application presented here, Fuzzy Logic helps us to determine the degree of membership of the different towns to each risk zone and then can determine which evacuation road could be the most suitable one. Therefore, Association Rules obtained from FDC will assist on the decision making process, for instance, when it is necessary to choose among different available evacuation routes, it has to be considered quality measures such as confidence and support that association rules provide.
