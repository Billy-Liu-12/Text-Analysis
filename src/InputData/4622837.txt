Design of Self-directed e-Learning Material Recommendation System with  On-line Evaluation

Abstract   Along with explosive growth of the IT and Internet,  they have led much development on education, such as e-learning, distance learning and on-line learning etc., which provide learners with another better alternative for learning at anytime and anywhere. Practically, the essence of the Information technology application on education is that Learning is the essential and the technology is the auxiliary. That is, on education, the information technology just acts as a method or a tool in the process of learning.

As the IT gets more mature, the e-learning becomes more popular. If the e-learning can effectively exploit the techniques of Data-mining, it will make user- learning more efficient. Thus, in this project, we not only continue the e-learning activity-based material recommendation system construction, but also design the self-evaluation system supporting with semantic search for an adaptive learning platform.

In this paper, we mainly propose the ontology- based self-evaluation system with material recommendation system for providing a better learning platform. In the item bank construction, we will invite some domain experts to assist the collection and creation of examination questions and classification.

We believe such self-directed learning system will be good for the improvement on the efficiency of the e- learning and will be beneficial to get more achievements on learning for learners.

1. Introduction   Computer-based systems have great potential for delivering learning materials [6], which efficiently release teachers from handling mechanical matters so they can practice far more humanized pedagogical thinking. However, information comes from different sources embedded with diverse formats in the form of metadata, making it troublesome for the computerized programming to create professional materials [7].

In this paper, we mainly continue our previous material recommendation system [5] and propose the self-directed e-learning system with on-line evaluation system for a better learning platform. The design details will be described as follows.

2. Related Works   While human knowledge is accumulated to a huge mass of data, it will be aware that the self-directed learning style based on the problem-oriented policy will be raised again and will become one of adaptive learning modes in the knowledge-explosive era.[3,4] With the technology development of the assessment analysis, the effect relationship among concepts can be constructed by analyzing the testing results.[10,11,12] The project?s goal mainly focused on how to combine the online evaluation system with material recommendation system [5] and to provide self- directed learners with complete course contents.

Through the evaluation system, learners could understand their capabilities and learn efficiently their interested topics. These related works are described for details as follows.

2.1. Problem-based Learning   Problem-based Learning, PBL[1], is student-  centered; it is not focused on the teacher who passes on information to the students, but on the learning process of the student. Furthermore, problems drive the learning process. Students learn to deal with the problems they will be faced with in later professional practice.

PBL mainly utilized these important, associated and practical cases to provide the necessary learning resources and directions and made learners learn of knowledge and problem-solved skills. We followed the essence of PBL to construct the item bank in the self- learning system.

DOI 10.1109/ICHIT.31    DOI 10.1109/ICHIT.2008.184      2.2 TjLRSE, Tajen Learning Resource Search Engine   TjLRSE[5] is a content-searching system for  TAJEN University, which mainly provides search service on e-learning materials made by StreamAuthor[9] package. As shown in the Figure 1, it consists of 4 parts, including web spider to collect the index data, search service to provide the user interface, association rule and collaborative filtration. The association rule is mainly adopted to find out the relations between these keywords learners used for searching the content. And, the collaborative filtration is applied to automatically filter the correct keywords of each course by analyzing previous users? activities.

Figure 1. The content-inquiring process of the TjLRSE  system  In implementing the material recommendation  system, we integrated the techniques of the LDAP and the JAXB to reduce the complexity of context parsing and analyze the learners? behaviors to conduct the feasible keywords of these contents. By mining these learners? activities to find the association among contents, the recommendation system will suggests learners for advanced learning material or provide related contents.

3. System Design   As shown in Figure 1, the system is divided into 2 subsystems: Material recommendation subsystem and self-evaluation subsystem. In the material recommendation system, we tried to apply the semantic web technology to effectively provide learners with the topic-related contents.

Figure 1. System Overview.

In Figure 2, it described the overall system.

Students can use the self-evaluation system for on-line testing at anytime and anywhere. After students finished the test, the system will suggest them with related keywords according to their test results.

Students can easily obtain the related content by querying with the keywords system provides. These associated materials will be provided as the URLs from material recommendation system. Learners just clicked these hyperlinks and then these e-learning contents will be retrieved for them to study correctly and efficiently.

Figure 2. System Architecture.

3.1 Item-bank Construction  The basic unit of knowledge is the relation property  between concept nodes. And then, these properties construct the knowledge network. Nevertheless, the same concept will mean differently while apply on different domains. And, even in the same knowledge domain, different information will be retrieved while different topic is concentrated.

Figure 3. Triple used as the construction of knowledge  An item consists of a question, an answer and many  Triples, references to related knowledge. Each item owns a concept independence coefficient to the concept triple. In intelligent test researches, the authors in [2] proposed an Evaluation Balance Table, EBT, to specify the key concepts of items. As show in Table 1, Qi represents question i; Cj represents the topic concept; eij represents the degree of relation between Qi and Cj, which values from 0 to 5. We can use the EBT to check the similarity between items. We also applied this table in our item bank construction.

Table 1. Evaluation Balance Table.

3.2. Material Recommendation   In this material recommendation part, the system  recommended the related content by analyzing previous learners? activities. We kept at least ten terms, previously used by learners, in each unit. Additionally, term frequency is also maintained. We assume that in one unit, if the term gets a higher frequency, then it will be better to be one of possible keywords for this unit.

In order to recommend the more adoptive content to users, we designed a characteristic evaluation formula as shown in Eq. 1 as a criterion for the rank of the recommendation.

Total  )Si,Frequency( G  i  kk  th k  n~1i  i  n  1k i  i  ? ==     4. System Implementation      Figure 4. The process flows of the on-line testing.

In implementing the on-line testing system prototype, we mainly followed the flows as shown in Figure 4. When a user started the examination, he/she should firstly choice the initial item to answer. After answering each question, the ability of a learner will be evaluated by the system. If the estimated ability of a learner does not meet the termination criterion yet, the next question will be provided automatically.

Otherwise, the test will be terminated, and the testing results and the suggestions for learners will be introduced from the evaluation system as shown in Figure 5. As shown in Figure 6, a learner followed the suggestions from the system to query the recommendation contents. And then, the URLs of these related contents will be provided by the material recommendation system.

5. Conclusion and Future Works   In this paper, we adopted the problem-based learning strategy to the self-directed learning and evaluation system. Such the e-learning system does not only provide on-line testing but also support with e- learning activity-based material recommendation services. The recommendation system provides these related contents to learners according to the keywords of the items. By association rule implementation, it assists learners to achieve the integrity of course.

The system prototype has been established but not completed. So far, there are 28 URLs of courses registered in the recommendation system respectively.

It contains about 574 course units in total. Each query request spends about 0.65 seconds. Currently, we proceed to invite domain experts for item collection and classification, and then to design the adaptive item selection policy such as the guiding item selection policy or the topic-oriented item selection policy as proposed in [8]. At last, we will evaluate the efficiency of self-directed learning system by questionnaire. We  believe that such the deployment will be helpful to achieve the better performance of studying and learning satisfaction for learners.
