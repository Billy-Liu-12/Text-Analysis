A Systematic Method to Design a Fuzzy Data Mining Model

Abstract-Based on the available transaction records, we use AprioriTid model to derive the association rules from large database. We then exploit association rules to establish an initial fuzzy inference model. ,A novel tuning method is proposed to adjust the fuzzy model such that every association rule from data mining model can in turn help us recommend the most appropriate products to the prospective customers. By combining the Larsen?s inference method and gradient descent method, we derive a systematic approach to refine the fuzzy model. Thus, a new adjusting method, i.e., Larsen-like, is proposed in this paper. How to derive the association rules from large database, how to apply the derived rules to establishing a fuzzy inference model, and how to optimize the fuzzy model are illustrated by simple examples.



I. INTRODUCTION  Fuzzy logic-based models and systems can be found everywhere in our daily life. Washing machine, refrigerator, and air conditioner are among the frequently used household appliances that have used the fuzzy technique. Thus, fuzzy set theory attracts more and more attentions since Zadeh introduced it in 1965 [6]. In fuzzy set theory, users can use the given data to define membership functions to characterize an element with a fuzzy subset. Whenever the input and output variables are known, we can use some training data to design a rule base to model the behavior of the to-be-controlled system. Users can also apply some techniques to adjusting the fuzzy model to a satisfactory performance [7-81.

Similar to fuzzy set theory, the extension theory [ 5 ] investigates how to formalize our concepts to solve the incompatible or contradictory problems. In our daily life, domain experts can handle many things without difficulty.

Whenever a question is asked, most people can give an exact or nearly correct answer intuitively or through some sort of thinking. How can we integrate the conceptual ideas into helping solve the complicated problems? The Laplace transformation used in the engineering field provides such a good example. In extension theory, let?s define the name of a matter by N, one of the characteristics of the matter by CR, and the value about CR by V. We use an ordered ternary R=(N, CR, V) as the fundamental element to describe a matter for transformation and call it a matter element [5]. As shown in [9], the extension theory can combine with the fuzzy theory to enhance the performance of a fuzzy model.

Recently, data mining technique becomes more and more important in e-commerce. In the Internet-based commerce, a better personal service is a key to make profits. Data mining  Kent Lin CRM Department Neiman Marcus  Dallas, TX 75201 U.S.A.

E-mail: Kent-Lin@neimanmarcus.com  means a process to extract useful information from a large database [l-31. If we can discover more useful association rules from a large database, we can provide better service for customers. In a database containing sales transactions, it is important to exploit some techniques to discover the implicit relationship inside the transactions. In today?s business, data mining provides another way for a company to realize the personalized service to its customers. Unlike conventional models that only concerned whether items appeared simultaneously in the transactions, we propose a deeper model that also considers some important factors, such as purchased quantity and total expenditure, during the mining process. Therefore, this paper exploits the association rules to derive a fuzzy inference model that is called a fuzzy data mining model.

11. ASSOCIATION RULES AND FUZZY CLUSTERING  As we know, a fuzzy rule base can be derived directly from numerical data. Traditionally, fuzzy clustering methods, such as fuzzy c-means and mountain clustering, can help group the training data to establish the fuzzy rule base. In this paper, we apply the association rules derived from transaction database as a mean to clustering the data patterns.

2. I Association rules from lalge database  The process of data mining can be divided into two steps: (1) find all frequent item sets; and (2) generate strong association rules from the frequent item sets [I]. Two criteria are used to measure the frequent item sets. Traditionally, both minimum support and confidence are defined in advance to find the frequent item sets. The support value from grouping item A with item B is defined as follows:  (1) #_tuples-coniaining_both_ A-and- B  # - transactions Support ( A  B )  =  Similarly, the confidence value from relating item A to item B is defined as follows:  # - tuples - containing - both - A - and - B  # - tuples - containing - A Confidence(A = B )  = f (2)  Based on the predefined support and confidence values, we can find whether two or more items appear frequent enough in the transactions. Different methods have been proposed to find the association rules. Apriori algorithm [4] finds frequent  0-7803-7280-8/02/$10.00 02002 IEEE 896  mailto:Kent-Lin@neimanmarcus.com   item sets by using the candidate generation. Apriori employs an iterative approach known as level-wise search, where k-item sets are used to explore (k+l)-item sets. A two-step process, which consists of joining and pruning actions that look at how Lk-1 is used to find L, , is required.. The joining step is defined to find Lk , a set of candidate k-items generated by joining Lk-1 with themselves. In the pruning step all candidates (ck ) having items no less than the minimum support are fiequent by definition. AprioriTid is a refined version of the original Apriori algorithm [4]. The feature of the AprioriTid is that the database is not used for counting support after the first pass. Thus, much time can be saved. The Boolean method is another approach to obtaining the association rules [2]. In the Boolean algorithm two major steps are needed. First, both logical OR and AND operations are used to compute the frequent item sets. Second, logical AND and XOR operations are applied to deriving all interesting association rules. As can be seen that the Apriori, AprioriTid, and Boolean algorithms can derive the association rules without difficulty. The problem is how to modify the conventional models such that they can provide more valuable information for today?s business. In this paper, we select AprioriTid method to obtain the association rules.

2.2 Fuzzy clustering  The AprioriTid method in data mining allows us to derive the large item sets step by step. For example, large 3-item sets are obtained from large 2-item sets. Based on this knowledge, we can use the first two items as the premise variables and the third one as the consequent variable in fuzzy rules. Since different attributes, such as retailed price, may associate with a product. We focus on the price factor in ow fuzzy model with the hope to recommend the appropriate products to customers to fulfill a personalized service. In ow example, we analyze the purchasing behavior from 20,000 transactions. Since we are conceming the price factor, the transactions that spent less than 100 dollars were removed from our records. Based on this observation, the distribution of the retailed prices is roughly divided into three parts, each corresponding to a fuzzy subset as shown in Fig. 1. For example, we use Low (L), Medium (M), and High (H) for price in Fig. 1. The purpose here corresponds to categorize the grocery and to quickly establish an initial fuzzy rule base in accordance with the price factor if no other clustering method is used.

The application of fuzzy clustering in target selection from large databases for direct marketing (DM) purposes is discussed in [IO]. Association rules from a large database are used as training patterns. The results obtained from a well-tuned fuzzy inference model are applied to deriving what class of items should be recommended to prospective customers.

111. THE PROPOSED MODEL  Previous models generated the association rules by considering whether the interesting items exist simultaneously or not. Most models did not consider the number of purchased quantity, total expenditure, or seasonal factor in a single transaction. As we know, in wholesale stores, customers usually buy multiple pieces of the same item. As a result, the purchased quantity should be carefully considered.

Due to the world wide economic recession and high unemployment rate, people will control their own budget.

Thus, in this paper we extract the factor of retailed price from the association rules and put it into the fuzzy model. Take the transaction records in Table 1 for example. It means that the first customer bought item-A, item-B, and item-C with prices 19, 24, and 23 dollars, respectively. The second customer bought item-D, item-E, and item-F with prices 48, 487, and 134, respectively. Although each customer bought three items, the total expenditure is quite different. Some customers prefer to buy low-priced products but some enjoy having high-priced items. Thus, the relationship among the products in the first transaction is different from the second one. Our purpose is to establish a fuzzy model to enhance the personalized service.

3. I Matter-element analysis  We apply the matter-element model discussed in extension theory to constructing our new model [5,9]. As we know, the retailed price for each item is already given in the transaction record. When considering from the aspect of retailed price, we can express the transaction in terms of matter-element model as follows:  For example, item-A in the first transaction in Table 1 can be expressed by:  The membership degree for item-A in the hzzy subset L is determined by the membership hc t ions  defined in Fig. 1.

Similarly, item-B in the first transaction can be expressed either by:  R = (item - name, price, membership degree).

RA = (item - A ,  price, p L  (A) )  .

RB = (item - B, price, p L  (B))  or R, = (item - B, price, p M  ( B ) )  .

It happens that two or more consecutive membership functions may include a given price and result in different rules to fire.

From Table 1, the association rule from the first transaction can be derived as follows:  RA, = (item - AB, price, p L  (A)  x p L  ( B ) )  or RA, = (item - AB, price, p L  ( A )  x p M  (B) )  .

Similarly, the association rule from the second transaction can be obtained as follows:  R ,  = (item - DE, price, p M  ( D )  x p H  (E))  or R ,  = (item - DE, price, p H  ( D )  x p H  ( E ) )  .

Having analyzed from the transaction records when both item-A and item-B have been purchased customers may continue purchasing item-C, we may derive the following  0-7803-7280-8/02/$10.00 (92002 IEEE 897    fuzzy rules: If item-A is FA, and item-B is FB, , then item-C is FC, .

Note that FA,, FB, , and FCi are linguistic variables defined for item-A, item-B, and item-C, respectively.

Assuming three labels, low (L), medium (M), and high (H), are selected for all premise and consequent variables in our model. Depending on the distribution of the data, different labels may be used in different cases. Besides, the fuzzy rules may take other types in consequent parts [8].

The next step is to establish the hzzy inference rule base such that we can have an idea what kind of next item should be recommended to prospective customers. Fig. 2 illustrates the procedures for our fuzzy inference model. When minimum support is 0.1% and confidence is 40%, we obtained 244 association rules for 3-large item sets as shown in Fig. 3. We use those 244 patterns as our training data for the fuzzy rule base similar to the one depicted in Table 2.

When the minimum support value is increased, the number of rules reduces from 244 to only 16 as depicted in Fig. 4.

Furthermore, in Fig. 5 we plot the 1-, 2-, and 3-large item sets.

Fig. 6 shows part of the 244 association rules from our data mining model.

3.2 The gradient descent method forfuzzv models  A roughly established fuzzy model needs further optimization to meet the control or identification requirement better. For example, adjusting the centers and spreads of the triangular membership functions can affect the firing degrees of the fuzzy rules. Define the error function as follows:  (3)  E = y ( y c  - y d ) 2  9  where yc  and yd denotes the inferred and desired outputs, respectively. Assuming the parameters to be adjusted in fuzzy models are p i ' s .  The quantity of pi  to be adjusted in each iteration can be obtained by taking the first derivatives of B I + from Eq.(3). As long as the quantity of pi to be adjusted is determined, the new pi  can be updated as follows:  (4)  where y, is the preset learning rate. For example, the consequent part y in singleton-type hzzy rule is adjusted by the combination of chain rules and gradient descent method as follows:  a W;(t+l)=W;(t)-y,- h i  /c\  In Eq.(5), 7, represents the prearranged learning rate.

Similarly, if the triangular membership functions are used, taking the first derivatives of the error function with respect  to the centers and spreads of the membership functions allow us to systematically adjust the fuzzy models.

When the consequent part is a fuzzy number, the conventional gradient descent method is not directly applicable to this kind of fuzzy model if the center of area defuzzification method is used [9]. To apply the gradient descent method to refining a fuzzy model, the expression of the conventional center of area method must be reformulated.

Suppose that in a specific fuzzy system three fuzzy rules are fired. Next, we will use Fig. 7 to illustrate how the center of area method works and how a crisp output is inferred.

In Fig. 7, y L  and y R  correspond to the left and the right margins to which the inferred outputs mapped, respectively. pl , p 2  , and p 3  are the assumed firing degrees from the fired fuzzy rules. The center of area method calculates the center of gravity of the fuzzy output for the control action. Assuming the discretization numbers are m and the corresponding control output at the discrete pointj is yj , we have inferred output yc :  PiYj yc =+. (6)  C Pi i=l  Depending on the discretization numbers of output space selected, the defuzzification outputs may differ a little bit.

Before deriving a crisp output by the center of area method formulated in Eq.(6), the sampling steps must be determined in advance. By letting the discretization number be m, then the step size will be  (7)  Based on the definition of center of area method, we can reformulate the numerator of Eq.(6) as follows: m  i=l C piyi  = P ~ Y L  + PZ +A) + . . U +  ~m (YL  + (~-1)')  As a result, the center of area method expressed in Eq.(6) can be rewritten as follows:  m 5 piyi (5 Pi + c ( i  - 1 ) p i ~ i=l i=l  F pi - yc =*- c Pi  i=l i=l (9)  i=l  It is clear that the new defuzzification formula is independent of yi and is more convenient for us to combine with the gradient descent method to adjust the fuzzy model. Before investigating how to formally adjust a fuzzy model, let us introduce a different inference method, i.e., the Larsenk inference method.

0-7803-7280-8/02/$10.00 02002 IEEE 898    Let pa,  represent the firing degree from the premise  part of the ith fuzzy rule and &,, be the corresponding  triangular membership functions are used. By defining the  have:  dE +, api & , , 8; 4, &; & , ,  8;  -  membership degree for the current output. Suppose that only  premise firing degrees of fuzzy rules by a product form, we  (iA-Yc)+(Y~ -AIpa ,  l-pb, (16) = ( Y C  - Y d )  di Lp p=l  Note that in Eq.(lO), uy and by correspond to the center and left or right spread of the ith fuzzy subset for thejth input variable, respectively. In Eq.(ll), ci and dj stand for the center and spread for the output membership function, respectively.

In this paper we present a Larsen's-like implication method to adjust the fuzzy model. The firing degrees from the premise parts are obtained by the minimum operations in the original Larsen's inference method. Here, the minimum operations for the premise parts are replaced by the product ones and the consequent parts are remained in the product forms to allow us to obtain the gradient descent method.

Therefore, our modified method is termed as the Larsen's-like one to distinguish it from the original method. Based on this modification, the inference degree for the consequent part will become:  We can derive the Larsen's-like gradient descent method as follows:  pi = pa, * pb, ' (12)  z - z +c a ~ i  2Pa, dA, a y  4 J c  &; aPo, 3Ay a y - ----- -  p=l  (13)  p=l  0-7803-7280-8/02/$10.00 02002 IEEE  As illustrated in Fig. 2, the procedures to derive our model can be summarized as follows: (1) Use conventional method, such as AprioriTid algorithm,  to obtain the large-item sets. For example, we can proceed from large 1-itemset A to large 2-itemset AB and then to large 3-itemset ABC.

(2) Express the interesting items by matter-element models.

(3) Denote the interesting items in smaller large-item set  Lk-1 as the conditional part and the item joined to Lk-l to generate the larger L k  as the consequent part in the fuzzy rules. Establish a fuzzy rule base from the derived association rules.

(4) Use the h z y  inference model to infer the quantity of candidate item for the prospective customers.



IV. EXPERIMENTAL PROCESS  To illustrate how the proposed model works with the conventional methods, we use 20,000 data from a large database including 143,114 transactions to run the simulations. We first exploit the AprioriTid method to extract the association rules. Fig. 3 shows the joining result when the minimum support is 0.1 YO and minimum confidence is 40%.

For comparison, Fig. 4 shows the joining result when the minimum support is increased to 0.15%.

Both Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 explain what will the next item be (as shown in the right-hand-side shopping cart) when two items have been purchased (as shown in the left-hand-side shopping cart). Comparing Fig. 3 with Fig. 4, it is quite clear that association rules decrease whenever either the minimum support or confidence is increased. Fig. 5 plots the large 1-, 2-, and 3-itemset when different conditions are set. Fig. 6 is the association rules from our data mining model. Again, the higher the thresholds, the lower the number in large item set.

For example, there are 100 patterns of 3-large item set (i.e., three items appeared simultaneously in the same transaction) when minimum support is 0.1 %. However, the quantity drops to 8 when minimum support is set to 0.15%. Since we use a double-input and single-output system to verify our model, 244 association rules shown in Fig. 6 serve as our training patterns in our example.

We propose a new model to derive the fuzzy rule base from the final association rules. By integrating the final association rules shown in Fig. 6, the transaction records in our database, the methods discussed in the third section, and the rule base from fuzzy c-means, we can adjust the fuzzy model. We pick 138 data from Fig. 6 to serve as our training patterns. Conventional fuzzy c-means method is exploited to cluster the data. The clustering results are plotted in Fig. 8.

The clustering results are then projected into each coordinate     to construct the initial membership functions as shown in Fig.

9 to Fig. 11. Depending on the types of fuzzy rules used, Eq.(3) to Eq.(16) are applied to refining our fuzzy models.

The purpose to establish such a fuzzy inference model is focused on providing personalized services to prospective customers. For example, there are 547 patterns in 2-large item set in Fig. 5. Part of the 2-item sets joins another item to become the 3-large item set. By taking the 2-itemset as the two premise variables and the third item in the corresponding 3-itemset as the consequent variable in the fuzzy rules, we can apply the refined fuzzy model to inferring the suitable products that can be recommended to the prospective customers to buy them. By the way, we can automatically forward any news or catalog closely related to the inferred item to the customers? electronic mails or websites to realize the personalized services and in turn to increase the company?s profits. This is why we emphasize that we dedicate to combine the proposed fuzzy model with the association rules to provide a better service to the prospective customers. We will report our simulation results later.

Comparison with previous work is also under investigation.



V. CONCLUSION  In this paper we combined the fuzzy inference model with the association rules from the large database to fulfill the personalized service. We created a new model that not only considered the association between interesting items but also took the factor of purchased quantity into account. This proposed model is particularly suitable to the wholesale stores.

However, the same technique can be easily applied to situations whenever different factors need to be considered.

The process to derive the large-item sets was illustrated by examples. How to establish the fuzzy inference model was also discussed in detail. Finally, we explained how to use the fuzzy model to recommend the most suitable items to the prospective customers. Our results verified that the proposed model is also useful in different areas.
