Autonomous Mining for Alarm Correlation  Patterns based on Time-shift Similarity

Abstract? Current alarm systems employed in manufacturing applications are ambiguous in terms of indicating the root causes of process disturbances, which causes many difficulties for decision making. As manufacturing systems increase in complexity and scale, the continued reliance on human operators for alarm information management is impossible. A computer- aided information management system would increase analytical capability for alarm analysis. To this effect, an autonomous data mining method is introduced to search historical alarm logs for the correlations that can represent causal relationships, which can aid alarm management and system improvement. A hierarchical clustering method is used to carry out the correlation pattern search. Moreover, the similarity function of this method is designed to identify certain pre-defined correlation patterns. This method is validated in a vertical turning machine center alarm system application. The proposed method can discover a large number of alarm correlations, which are usually neglected by operators, and manage the alarms in the way that clarify process disturbance and enable rapid root cause analysis  Keywords-manufactuirng process, alarm correlation patterns, diagnosis, similairty-based clustering, frequent pattern mining, Machine tool

I.  INTRODUCTION To advance the automation of manufacturing process  control, there is a tendency of growing needs for the automation of process anomaly management [1].  Traditionally when encountering anomalies, the controller automatically raises warnings or alarms. It provides immediate information so that operator can quickly evaluate what is occurring and take appropriate actions to remedy the anomaly situation. In most of manufacturing system, with hundreds of sensors, actuators or switches being connected to programmable logics controller (PLC), some alarms are fired by checking the threshold passing of measured variables. They are directly passed to controllers and displayed to operators as alarming messages. PLC also monitors system status variables by doing simple logic calculation and raises alarms when changes occur on them. The  function of all alarms is to help correct human mistakes and careless operations during the manufacturing process.

However with the increase of system complexity and scale, systematical analysis is needed to manage the alarm information described above. First, since a large amount of fired alarms actually do not indicate critical anomaly but only monitor process status, operator will need more clarified ranking of alarm significance to prioritize alarm messages as to make quick decisions and focus on the hidden root causes of anomalies. Second, lots of status-monitoring alarms provide boundaries to define the critical anomaly, though they do not pinpoint problems directly. If operators can recognize inherent correlation between these alarms, the alarm messages with clarified information will make diagnosis decision more accurate and timely. Third, in some complex systems, time- delayed failure propagation will continually cause ?phantom alarms? downstream, even if the upstream variables have been restored and the alarms have been deactivated [2]. So operators? quick identification of the root alarms will reduce confusion caused by phantom alarms. All above situations require more analytical capability of alarm management. The total reliance on human operators for alarm information management has been proved to become very difficult [3], Therefore, comprehensive recognition is reached to develop autonomous analytical solution to support operators for quick response and fusion of accumulated alarm information [4]. The paper targets at manufacturing system and researches how data mining oriented alarms correlation analysis can manage overwhelming alarm information by adding more analytic capability to the system for the purpose of assisting operators decision making.

The organization of the paper is as follows. In section II, selected alarm management methods are reviewed and compared with proposed method. In section III, we first overview the proposed approach step by step and then define the basic alarm occurrence patterns the paper will focus on.

Then we give some related definitions of the alarm model which will be used during the frequent pattern search such as                                                                   alarm events, occurrence variables and matrice the two steps of frequent alarm pattern search detail. The proposed search method converts frequent pattern search into multiple-di clustering with defined dissimilarity threshol proposed method is applied to 40 days? alarm scale vertical turning center with Siemens Finally conclusion is drawn and future work section VI.



II. RELATED WORK AND PROBLEM DEFINE A large number of projects and research h  out to improve the alarm system. Besides early factors? impacts on alarm system [5], some investigated alarm system problem and su management as cognitive activities. Other re engineering perspective, realized necessity alarm signal from other types of abnormal e with operation modes and status [7]. After remaining alarm signal should be more describing direct disturbance of process.

Also lots of research and successful applic developed in the field of alarm events analysis of fault detection and diagnosis. The state o categorizes advanced alarms message process nine categories. For example, causality based alarms to discover that a fault condition propa process; hierarchical based methods differe hierarchy such as plant, system, equipment lev study [9] introduced several categories of a systems. In the study, alarm correlation is de reciprocal relation among alarm messages process where they have parallelisms. From da of view, the reciprocal relation and paralle occurrences also can be considered as sequen frequent sequential patterns search, or associa as one of data mining tasks, has been studied with a wide diversity of data types [10-12].  Fo area of telecommunication service and com alarms usually are defined by MIB variable monitoring. And association rules based data are used to discover alarm correlation among event messages as to diagnose and localize n and IP duplicate failure. [13-15].

In fact, compared with expensive physic alarm events analysis, for most complex systems, data mining techniques realized offl real-world practice instead of design logics.

A alarm log from 7.5 meter vertical turning center is targeted as research object.  The machine is made by Dorries Scharmann and has Siemens 840D controller. It is used to machine large scale parts of certain energy generators. Totally 40 days data from real production are analyzed.  In this study, we focus on the PLC alarms made by machine manufactures including three types shown in Table 2. Channel alarms indicate PLC channel status. They are usually displayed as warning or reminding message. Spindle/Axis alarms monitor spindle related status. Last part of alarms is defined by specific machine user to monitor the coolant, spindle temperature, lubrications, and other concerned variables on machine elements. In fact most of alarms by process disturbance are with index ranging from 600000 to 700000. They will bring extra machine downtime.

TABLE 2 PLC ALARM Alarm Index  Range Alarm Source Total Alarms  Types  500000~599999 Channel alarms 25  600000~699999 Spindle/Axis alarm 4  700000~799999 Machine user defined 33  As to illustrate the proposed pattern mining method, several experiment results will be explained in followings.

B. Experiment one In this experiment, first, the 40 days alarms with index  ranging from 500000 to 599999 are converted into MAM day by day. And the mining algorithm is applied on every day?s MAM. The discovered patterns are reported. Figure 6 shows a part of alarm matrix from 17th day. The X axis denotes time scale. Filled unit means non-zero event count during that binned time interval.

If setup the dissimilarity threshold at 0.4 and use proposed mining algorithm to search alarm correlation patterns, the clustering result of the 17th day is shown in Figure 7 a). Here the dissimilarity threshold is selected to encompass the optimal number of pattern candidates, which occur at a relatively high  frequency. Total eight groups of patterns are discovered. So according to definition 4, we consider the eight groups of patterns are frequent. They are reported in the format as Figure 7 b) shows.

C. Experiment two Correlation patterns between channel status alarms and user  defined alarms (or spindle/Axis alarms) can discover related channels status for the disturbance. Therefore, after applying the mining algorithm and setting up the same dissimilarity threshold (0.4), the result is shown in Figure 8 (or Figure 10).

In the result, the 7th group indicates the active statuses of channel M24 and M25 have sequential relation with the detected events of ?tool magazine change door open? by PLC I/O. In fact this frequent pattern is discovered nearly on every day?s report. The pattern happens with a sequence of 510118- 700040-510118-510119-700040 as Figure 9 a) shows in detail and the b) shows in long term. However, during 40 days, there are two days as Figure 9 b) shows (April 09 and 10) in which the pattern has not been followed. Maintenance report showed this was caused by broken sensors and it is repaired in two days, though it has not caused total stop of machine operation.

This example proves correlation patterns between alarms can discovery some normal operation sequences. The disorder of normal pattern would be a sign of operation mistakes or sensing degradation.

This pattern narrows down the diagnostic search range for maintenance engineers during PLC logics checking.

D. Experiment three In this experiment, total alarm counts per day are calculated  by following method.  First, select the correlation frequent patterns with a dissimilarity of 0.2 from mining results of all three types? alarms; and sum up all occurrence counts of independent alarms and primary alarms to calculate total alarm occurrence count every day; Figure 11 shows results. Here primary alarm is defined as the most frequent alarms in every pattern. Without frequent patterns mining the operators will see average 370 alarm messages per day; if filter out repetitious alarms, average 149 alarm counts are eliminated per day.



VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK In summary, through autonomous mining for alarm  correlation patterns using the proposed method, the following contributions can be achieved:  First, some frequent correlation patterns of multiple alarms can be discovered and they are able to reflect normal operation sequence. Any changing on the pattern can indicate abnormal disturbances by sensor degradation or operation mistakes. The pattern also provides good reference for later PLC alarming mechanism improvements. Early failure warnings can then be established based on the pattern to provide intelligent online or offline warning rather than just displaying simple hardwired threshold checking alarms.

Second, the knowledge accumulated from frequent patterns can facilitate decision-making. Some discovered patterns are able to clarify the boundary of abnormal process disturbance.

This can help engineers to quickly target the ?problem? networks in the PLC or physical machine elements.  The boundary information will also help engineers to reproduce the occurrence of the disturbance or failure during the diagnosis.

Third, a large number of alarms or warning messages happen every day, while some of them are related to each other; others are duplicated warnings of same disturbance.

Combining repetitious alarms in within the same pattern can help maintenance engineers make more precise diagnosis decision and focus on critical problems.

Currently, the proposed methods have been applied and tested on a machine tool system. In the future, these methods will be improved for more complicated non-serial and non-  Figure 11.
