Space and Frequency Multiplexing

Abstract-During last 10 years, the use of frequencies at E?  band from 71 GHz to 76 GHz, from 81 GHz to 86 GHz and  from 92 GHz to 95 GHz to licensed users has been regulated in  lJS, Europe, Australia and Japan. Due to the large amount of  available bandwidth and reasonable atmospheric attenuation,  these frequency bands are suitable for very high data rate  radio communication for medium to long range wireless links.

However, in order to convert the bandwidth availability into  real capacity, suitable transmission techniques should be  designed. In the present paper, we propose a space-frequency  multiplexing technique using FDM, coded modulation and 4x4  MIMO spatial multiplexing for point-to-point multi-gigabit  connection in the 81-86 GHz bandwidth. We tested the  proposed system, considering different link distances, different  values of pathloss and atmospheric and rain attenuations.

Simulation results evidenced the possibility of achieving a 48  Gb/s net capacity over 5GHz bandwidth (spectral efficiency 9.6  b/s/Hz) with 99.98% availability at link distances up to 1 Km.
