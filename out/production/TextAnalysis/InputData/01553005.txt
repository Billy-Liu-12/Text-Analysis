Collaborative Filtering by Mining Association Rules from User Access Sequences

Abstract  Recent research in mining user access patterns for pre- dicting Web page requests focuses only on consecutive se- quential Web page accesses, i.e., pages which are accessed by following the hyperlinks. In this paper, we propose a new method for mining user access patterns that allows the pre- diction of multiple non-consecutive Web pages, i.e., any pages within the Web site. Our approach consists of two ma- jor steps. First, the shortest path algorithm in graph theory is applied to find the distances between Web pages. In or- der to capture user access behavior on the Web, the distances are derived from user access sequences, as op- posed to static structural hyperlinks. We refer to these distances as Minimum Reaching Distance (MRD) infor- mation. The association rule mining (ARM) technique is then applied to form a set of predictive rules which are fur- ther refined and pruned by using the MRD information.

The proposed approach is applied as a collaborative filter- ing technique to recommend Web pages within a Web site.

Experimental results demonstrate that our approach im- proves performance over the existing Markov model ap- proach in terms of precision and recall, and also has a better potential of reducing the user access time on the Web.

1. Introduction  Due to the increase in HyperText Transfer Proto- col (HTTP) traffic on the World-Wide Web (WWW), the amount of transaction log records generated and col- lected on the servers grows tremendously. In order to bene- fit from these server log records, data mining has emerged as a tool to extract any useful patterns and analyze user ac- cess behavior on the Web. This specific type of data mining technique is known as Web usage mining [15]. In par- ticular, the technique of mining user access patterns (also known as browsing patterns and path traversal pat- terns) has been applied in a wide range of applications including Web caching [11, 13], Web page recommenda- tion [6, 8, 9], and Web personalization [10, 12].

In general, mining user access patterns can be consid- ered as a special type of mining sequential patterns in the field of knowledge discovery and data mining. Associa- tion rule mining has recently attracted considerable atten- tion and proven to be a highly successful technique for extracting useful information from very large databases [1, 2, 7, 14]. For the problem of mining user access patterns, data sequences are typically user access sequences of Web pages. These access sequences are extracted from server log records via some Web data preparation techniques [5]. Ap- plying a method for mining user access patterns on these access sequences reveals the user browsing behavior on the Web.

Various algorithms and techniques for mining user ac-  Proceedings of the 2005 International Workshop on Challenges in Web Information Retrieval and Integration (WIRI?05)    cess patterns have been proposed in the literature. In [11, 12], variations of the Markov model such as first-order Markov model and all Kth-order Markov model were ap- plied to construct a predictive model to predict the user re- quests on Web pages. Their work mainly focused on the analysis of consecutive sequential access of Web pages, and hence given a currently visiting Web page, the ability to pre- dict the next request is limited to the following adjacent Web pages on the user access sequence. For example, given a user access sequence containing n Web pages in an or- dered list, (p1, p2 , . . . , pn), where pi represents a Web page, an approximation of the first-order Markov model would contain the transitional probabilities of two adjacent Web pages in the user access sequence, Pr(pi | pi?1), where 1 < i ? n.

In this paper, we propose a new approach for mining user access patterns. The approach aims at predicting Web page requests on the Web site in order to reduce the access time and to assist the users in browsing within the Web site. To capture the user access behavior on the Web site, an alterna- tive structure of the Web is constructed from user access se- quences obtained from the server logs, as opposed to static structural hyperlinks.
