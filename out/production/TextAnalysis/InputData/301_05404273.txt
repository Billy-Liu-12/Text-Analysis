An Approach of Splitting Web Sequential Access Log  for Accurate Web Recommendation

Abstract?There are many kinds of intelligent technologies for helping web page navigation. Among them, association rules are one of popular technologies to discover interesting and frequent user access patterns in web sites. But association rules have not been very useful in practice because excessive rules are generated. In this paper, we suggest a new approach to discover a small number of more accurate rules from web site access records. By analyzing ten thousands of web page navigation logs from a shopping mall site, we have noticed that people have a special pattern in web page navigation when their interests change. When their interest is changed, they drop by one of frequently visited web pages such as a list page of items or the front page. For example, if a person was visiting web pages on MP3 players and now he wants to move to mobile phones, he usually drop by the front page or a list page of items and then choose a web page on mobile phones rather than directly goes to mobile phones from MP3 players. The proposed method separates a session record into several sub-sessions with such frequently visited pages, and finds user access patterns in the separated ones. The separated sub-session records may have more cohesive access patterns because those are related to the same item. With this idea, we construct a method of web page request prediction. We evaluate our system with huge data set.

With those results, we confirm that our proposed method is effective on web page prediction.

I. INTRODUCTION For the last two decades, the World Wide Web is one of the  biggest inventions. A large number of people in the world use the Web as information passageway. Most of all business uses the Web as a tool to promote the sale of their products. Thus, it is important to provide users with efficient, convenient and proper navigation of their web sites. Many web browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome are entering into a competition to develop more intelligent technology for web navigation.

The prediction of the web pages which users probably visit next is one of the main issues in web navigation technology.

For predicting the next web page a user will access, the most popular approach is web usage mining. Users? navigation data collected in a web server log is analyzed and web pages are recommended to users based on the analysis.

H. Leberman proposed Letizia  system that tracks user behavior and attempts to identify items of interest [1]. The system works on client?s computer so it cannot use other people?s information. By contrast, WebWatcher system predicts the next selected hyperlink by using reinforcement learning on server side [2]. The system explicitly asks users what is their interest.

B. Mobasher et al. used association rules for web recommendation system [3]. The accuracy and the coverage were high. But too many rules were extracted and it had many redundancies because it discovered rules from the access of two web pages far from each other in a session.

In [4], Markov chains were used for web path analysis and link prediction. The authors modeled user traversal in web space with Markov state transition matrix. Their system clustered users? navigation sequence records. Comparing visitor?s navigation sequence with a set of users, it offers a personalized navigating.

WebPersonalizer provided a framework to discover interesting usage patterns [5]. It suggested web pages to the current user based on their browsing similarities to the previous users by using usage data and hypertext structure. But finding data of similarity users with the visitor in usage data cost long search time so it is not effective on on-line web recommendation.

Yoda is designed to support large-scale Web-based applications requiring highly accurate recommendation in real- time [6]. It produces recommendation web page list in short time by using clustering web pages. But it fails to detect user?s interest change like other previous studies.

We are focusing a pattern found in web page navigation.

While navigating, people visit web pages for more than one item. When a person visits a website, she/he first visits web pages related to his/her the primary interest item for a while, then goes to web pages for another item. We analyze huge web page navigation logs from a shopping mall site. We have noticed that people have a special pattern in web page navigation when their interest items change. When their interest is changed, they drop by one of frequently visited web pages such as a list page of items or the front page. Based on this assumption, we split a sequence of web pages in a session  978-1-4244-4946-0/09/$25.00 ?2009 Crown    into subsequences by interest change, and we extract association rules from sub-sequences.

We evaluate our method using web server log of a shopping mall. Our approach discovered more accurate rules for navigation prediction. It predicts users? next accessing pages with high accuracy. We expect our method is very useful to web page prediction service.

This paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we will present an approach to split web access log. Section 3 describes the web page recommendation method. We present a performance evaluation of our method in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper.



II. SPLITTING WEB ACCESS LOG For web recommendation system, a high accuracy of  recommendation and a fast production of recommendation result are important, because too many recommended web pages and long delay of web page response can obstruct visitors? navigation. For discovering a small number of more accurate rules from web site access records, we propose a method splitting web access log. If a visitor interested in something, the user continually browses related web pages with the interest until the interest is changed. So, the splitting a log can separate the connection between the groups which have not a close relation.

Generally people have interest in more than one item. It means that there can be some patterns in navigation for interest items. When a person visits a website, she/he first visits web pages related to his/her the primary interest item.

Next he/she visits web pages for the secondary items. The proposed method splits a sequential web access record into several subsequences based on user interest change.

We propose a novel and simple method that can be used to perceive users? interest changing. The method cuts a user's navigation record, when a user moves from a Non-Frequently Visited Web page (NFVW) to a Frequently Visited Web page (FVW). FVWs are defined as web pages which most users visit, such as the front page, product list pages, etc. NFVWs are web page which a relatively small number of users visit, such as description pages on specific items. Usually, the description page on an item is visited by users who have an interest in that item, but the main pages or product list pages are visited by most users. Thus it can be said that the front page or list pages are more frequently than description pages on specific items.

For example, there is a user who visits an LCD monitor description web page in a computer shopping mall site. The visitor will first visit a monitor category page and then choose pages on LCD monitors. If the user wants to take a look at CRT monitors, the person will go back to the monitor category web page and choose web pages for CRT monitors. Thus, the monitor category web page will frequently be visited than LCD or CRT monitor pages. Now if the user wants to visit keyboard pages, the user will go back to the front page of the site and choose a keyboard category page. So, the front page is probably the most visited page in the site. In consideration of  this example, we can assume that a user will browse frequently visited web pages when his/her interest changes.

Our method is based on the presumption.

A web session, W, is represented by a sequence of pages W={P1, P2, ?, Pn}, that were accessed by a user. P1 is the first visited web page by a user, Pn is the last. The proposed method splits W into several subsequences S={S1, S2, ?, Sm} where Sk W for k=1, 2, ?, m, Si Sj=? for i j, WSi  l  i =?  =1 All  web pages in Sk is early accessed than those in Sk+1, that is, the max value of Pi included Sk is smaller than the min value of pi included Sk+1.

Figure 1 shows an example of splitting user?s navigation.

The sequence in Figure 1 is a navigation record of a user and circles are FVWs and squares are NFVWs. Sequence A is a navigation record of a user. Sequence B is three separated subsequences. We regard each subsequence as an independent sequential web access log. We define FVWs as web pages the most visited by users. We do not check if a web page is the front page or a list page. If a web page is frequently visited by users. We use it as an FVW.



III. WEB PAGE RECOMMENDATION When a user requests a web page, the web site recommends  pages to the user based on web pages the user visited. In order to recommend, we use association rules.

Association rule learning is a popular method for discovering interesting relation between variables in data mining. Agrawal et al. introduced association rules for discovering connection between products in a large database of customer transactions [7]. An example of such an association rule is the statement that 90% of people who purchase bread and butter also purchase milk. The number of 90% is the confidence factor of the rule.

A rule is defined as an implication of the form X Ij, where X is a set of some items in I, and Ij is a single item in I that is not present in X. I is usually a be as set of binary attributes, {I1, I2, ?, Im} called items. Let T be a database of transactions. Each transaction t is represented as a binary vector, with t[k] = 1 if Ik is in t, and t[k] = 0 otherwise.

To select interesting rules from all possible rules, additional constraints are used. Usually, the support and the confidence are used. The support of an itemset X is defined as the proportion of transactions in the data set which contain the itemset, X, and the confidence of a rule, X Ij, is defined an estimate of the probability P(Ij|X).

Discovering association rules from web access log is an off-line processing. The process is composed of two steps. The first step is splitting collected sequential web access log and the second is extracting association rules from the split log  Figure 1.  Splitting a Navigation Record    using by Apriori algorithm. The algorithm finds groups of items satisfying the minimum support threshold. Table 1 shows an example of sequential web access log. There are four users. On the assumption that web pages A, B, D, E, F and G are NFVWs and web page C is an FVW, Table 2 shows the result of splitting the log. For example, in the case of user 1, he/she visited {A, B, C, D, E}. Since C is an FVW so the log is split into {A, B} and {C, D, E}. The two split logs are dealt with two independent logs. After the log is separated, Association discovering algorithm is applied to the logs. Table 3 shows the frequent itemsets and their supports. A frequent itemset is an itemset whose support is greater than the specified minimum support. In this example?s is 2. For example, the support of itemset {A, B, G} is 2 that is in the split sequential web access log there are two logs which contain items A, B and G. Since the minimum support is set to 2 and the support of {A, B, G} is greater than or equal to 2, {A, B, G} is chosen as frequent itemsets. But the support of itemset {C, D, F} is 1 in Table 2, so it is not included the frequent itemsets in Table 3.

For recommendation web pages are scored. In case where a user visits web pages w the score of web page w is support(w {p}) / support(w). The score is the confidence of an association rule w {p}. For example, when a user visits web pages {C, D}, the score of web page {E} is 2 / 3.



IV. EXPERIMENTAL In this section, we discuss the experimental data set and  describe our evaluation metrics and setup, and the results of our approach comparing with the reference method.

A. Dataset In our experiments, we use web server log data from a e-  commerce site for our analysis. The log was used as data set of ECML/PKDD 2005 Discovery Challenge. The click-stream data contains information about accessed time, visitor? IP address, session ID, visited page and referrer. About ten thousands of records are collected between January 20, 2004 and February 13. The log has 57,086 session logs and 28,506 web pages. 21,061 sessions contain two or more web pages and 3,060 pages are product detail pages. The average length of sessions is 7 and the average of length the sessions which contain two or more pages is about 17.

For our experiments, we used the sessions from January 21 until January 28 as training data and from January 29 until February 5 as test data. We eliminate web access log containing more than 300 web page access, because we regarded as an access log of a search engine robot.

B. Experimental Setup and evaluation metrics After extracting frequent patterns from training data, we  give the first of accessed web pages of specific length in each web access log from test data and evaluated how to effectively predict the rest accessed web pages. And we only use access log of detail of product page for extracting pattern and evaluating without other pages such as front page and product list page. In order to compare with a reference method, we use 5 different metrics. The metrics are precision, coverage, F- measure, R-measure and Top-K ranking. Precision and coverage are defined as follows:  pagesdrecommendeofnumberTotal pagesdrecommendeinpagesaccesssuserofNumberprecision '=  pagesaccesssuserofnumberTotal pagesdrecommendeinpagesaccesssuserofNumbercoverage  ' '=  Precision measures the degree to which the method produces accurate recommendations. Coverage is the probability that a recommended page will be visited by the user. Generally, the more web pages a method recommends, the lower precision the method gets, and the fewer web pages a method recommends, the higher coverage the method gets.

So, precision and coverage are needed to be considered together. F-measure considers both as follows:  coverageprecision coverageprecisionF  + ??= 2  R-measure produces a higher value if a smaller recommendation set can cover user?s requesting pages.

Because a large recommendation set is not helpful to users, it is a measure of effectiveness of in web recommendation.

pagesdrecommendeofnumberTotal CoverageR =  Top-K ranking measures the precision of highly ranked web pages of each recommendation. It is effective measure for    testing web recommendation system, because many web sites recommend a visitor the fixed-size of highly ranked web pages.

We compared our method with one of existing method extract association rules from web access log without splitting.

The reference method is used in many previous studies. We compared the measures of recommendation against varying recommendation thresholds and pattern sizes.

C. Experimental results Table IV shows the number of extracted association rules  by each method. According to the result, our method extracts total 2,151,108 rules. It is a decrease of 86 percent compared with the reference method. So, our method can reduce the association rule extraction time and pattern search time in practical.

The precision of our method is overall higher than the reference and 0.11 higher on average. Especially, methods use the three-size patterns, the proposed method?s the precision is 0.16 higher than another?s on average. It means that our method recommends more related web pages.

In contrast to the result of precision, the reference method shows higher coverage than proposed method. However it is general with recommendation system. Because recommending many web pages leads to high coverage and low precision. So, many recommendation systems and search engines try to increasing coverage with precision. We analyzed our method fail to recommend many pages because of its small number of association rules.

Table VII and VIII show the recommendation effectiveness based on the measures. The proposed method is worse than the reference method on evaluation result based on F-measure. However our method is better on R-measure point of view. Though the result based on F-measure, the proposed method is not good at producing many related web pages in comparison with another method.

But considering for the result of R-measure, our method is better than another method to recommend a few related web pages. After considering two results, we reached the conclusion that our method is better for a web recommendation system, but not a search engine. Because web recommendation system tends to recommend little web pages for doing not interrupt a visitor?s browsing. But in case of a search engine, a visitor browses many web pages in search result. So, in the case, both of the precision and the recall are important.

In the result based on F-measure, the proposed method is better when recommendation threshold is under 0.2. And in the other cases, our method is worse.  The cause of this result is that the precision of our method is significantly better if recommendation threshold is in low.

The proposed method is 0.08 higher than compared method on average in the result based on R-measure. Our approach is significantly better than another when recommendation threshold is over 0.6. Because the highly scored web pages are recommended, our approach is better than another method in point of R-measure view, and it means that the proposed method is good for web recommendation system.

The result of evaluation based on Top-k ranking measure is in Table IX. In case of the highest scored page recommendation, the precision of the proposed method is 1 to 8 percent higher than the reference method?s. The precision of the higher ranked is more important than lower?s because the systems recommend top ranked pages. Especially, when the proposed method recommends web pages using by the patterns those sizes are 3, the method shows the good result.

V. CONCLUSION In this paper, we introduced a method which can extract  more related rules from sequential web access log. For this, we proposed a method which splits a web access log in to several parts to separate connection between unrelated web pages. The method split a log when a user drops by frequently visited web page such as front page and product list pages, because we have noticed that the visitor navigates these pages when user?s interest changes. We have demonstrated that the method shows the high accuracy of web page recommendation using a few association rules on the real world dataset.
