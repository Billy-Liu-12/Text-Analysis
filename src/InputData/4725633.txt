Process Quality Optimization Model Based on ARM and Immune Principle

Abstract   Facing with increasing international competition, how to reduce process variability is always one of the major concerns of manufacturing organization. The purpose of this paper is to investigate a data driven optimization model: Process Quality Optimization Model (PQOM) based on Association Rules Mining (ARM) and immune principle to support both static and dynamic optimization of process quality.

Realization of PQOM consists of two stages. First, ARM is used to analyze historical SPC data to explore the explicit, hidden process input-output mapping relations that affect final product quality. Then, based on excavated rules, negative selection algorithm inspired by natural immune system is introduced to analyze on-line monitoring data for dynamic quality control. Two types of rule are utilized, namely Rules For Process Optimization (RFPO) and Rules For Exception Detection (RFED). RFED is used as detector to target process exception, while RFPO is used as immune antibody that reacts to process exception. The PQOM model is tested in a squeeze casting enterprise to verify its feasibility and correctness.

1. Introduction   Facing with increasing international competition, great pressure is put on manufacturing organizations to reduce product costs and increase product quality. For the manufacturing organization, these pressures translate into a continuous effort to reduce process variability and maintain a stable manufacturing operation [1]. Statistical Process Control (SPC) is a quality control tool widely used in manufacturing industry for quality control. However, the method only controls the individual parameter without considering the correlations of the process with other parameters.

For complicated manufacturing processes, due to the existence of multiple coefficients among variants,  nonlinear interactions, and the intermittent nature of the problem, even when the parameters are all under control, the process system is still unstable [2].

Therefore, new control optimization method is highly desirable.

With the rapid development of computer technology, tighter process control and more frequent process observations are adopted. In many instances, real time data collection, supported by desktop computer networks, accumulates a wealth of manufacturing process information [1]. Making full use of the information to explore the hidden rules has great significance for improvement of process quality optimization and efficiency of data utilization [3-4].

To find out the valuable knowledge from the massive volume of data, people began to study Data Mining (DM) technology from the 1990s. Now, DM has been successfully applied to many fields [5-6], including industrial process modeling [7-8].

The purpose of this paper is to investigate an effective and efficient data driven optimization model: Process Quality Optimization Model (PQOM) based on ARM and immune principle to support both static and dynamic optimization of process quality. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

Section 2 presents a brief introduction to ARM.

Section 3 describes the general architecture of the optimization method. Section 4 describes the major steps to realize the method proposed in this paper. A case study is presented in section 5. Finally the conclusions and suggestions for future research directions are presented in section 6.

2. Association rules mining   ARM is one of the most important and well researched techniques of DM technology. It aims to extract the credible, innovative, effective, and potentially useful patterns from large amounts of data [9-10].

2008 International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Design  DOI 10.1109/ISCID.2008.216   2008 International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Design  DOI 10.1109/ISCID.2008.216     A formal statement of the association rules problem is [11-13]: Let I be a set of items (objects) and T a set of transactions with items in I, both assume to be finite.

Definition 1: An association rule is an implication of the form A?C, where A, C?I, A, C?? , and A?C = ? are sets of items called itemsets. Here, A is called antecedent, and C consequent. The rule A?C means ?every transaction of T that contains A contains C too?.

Two important measures for association rule, support and confidence, can be defined as follows.

Definition 2: The support of itemset I0? I with respect to a set of transactions T is  { } ( , )= 00  T I supp I T  T  ? ?? ? (1)  Definition 3: The support of rule A?C in T is  ( , )= ( , )supp A C T supp A C T? ?                (2)  And its confidence is  ( , ) ( , )( , )= ( , ) ( , )  supp A C T supp A C Tconf A C T supp A T supp A T  ? ? = ?   (3)  Support of an association rule is defined as the percentage of records that contain A?C to the total number of records in the database. The confidence of a rule indicates the degree of correlation in the dataset between A and C, it is a measure of a rule?s strength.

Usually thresholds of support and confidence are predefined by users to drop those rules that are not so interesting or useful. The two thresholds are called minimal support and minimal confidence respectively.

The algorithm adopted in this paper for ARM is Apriori algorithm, which is the best known ARM algorithm [12-13]. The key idea of the Apriori algorithm is that if an itemset doesn?t satisfy the user- specified minimum support, then its supersets also will not and can be pruned. This will greatly reduce the number of itemsets considered.

3. Architecture of PQOM based on ARM   The generic architecture of PQOM based on ARM consists of two major modules, namely Association Rules Mining Module (ARMM) and Immune Detection and Optimization Module (IDOM), as shown in Fig. 1. First, ARMM is used to analyze historical SPC data and find out association rules.

Then, the result is analyzed for optimization of process parameters and serves for the input of the IDOM for dynamic control.

Architecture of PQOM  ARMM is mainly used for excavating, verifying and directly applying of association rules. Two types of rule are utilized in the research, namely Rules For Process Optimization (RFPO) and Rules For Exception Detection (RFED). RFED is used as detector of negative selection algorithm to target exception, while RFPO is used as antibody reacts to process exception.

In the PQOM, IDOM uses RFED generated by ARMM to inspect real-time process monitoring data.

Then RFPO is used for dynamic optimization. If no matching RFPO or RFED is found then default SPC control strategy is adopted.

As an off-line module, ARMM only supports static optimization. It is the initial step for system optimization. Based on the rules excavated by ARMM, IDOM acts as the immune system for the process system just like the natural immune system for the human body, which tries to detect and amend abnormities. IDOM optimize each process according to the on-line data, so it is called dynamic optimization in this paper. When the production condition changes, it is necessary to run ARMM again, since disturbance may bring in new rules, which in turn will affect IDOM.

4. Major steps to realize PQOM   4.1 Realization of ARMM   This stage use ARM technology to extract implicit  quality correlation from the data. The input of the stage is records of key process parameters and the corresponding quality evaluation results. The result is the association rules based on the input and manufacturing conditions. The major steps of the stage include [14]:       4.1.1. Define the tasks. The objective is to find out implicit and hidden quality relationship that affects the quality of the process by analyzing of historical statistics data. The key processes to be included have to be identified in this step.

4.1.2. Selection of data as input of data mining.  This involves selection of the key input and output parameters of the processes. The data selected should cover all conditions in production.

4.1.3. Data preprocessing. This step focuses on transforming of the raw statistical data into transactional data. The procedure includes definition of the data, removal of noise data, patching of missing data, and the appropriate standardization of data, dimensionality reduction and characteristics extraction of multi-dimensional data.

ARM deals with discrete data, so original data need to be transformed into discrete data before data mining.

The discretization method for preprocessing used in this paper is shown in Fig. 2. The interval between the control specifications is divided into 5 equal sections, the width of each discrete section is (UCL-LCL)/5, another two sections are set for the data exceeding the control specifications, so the total number of discrete sections is 7, and each section is set with different discrete value, such as ?Low?, ?Center? etc.

4.1.4. Data mining. After preprocessing, the data are put in a dataset; then appropriate association rule mining algorithm is used to analyze the dataset.

4.1.5. Knowledge extraction and explanation. This step concerns explanation and evaluation of the association rules excavated in the previous step.

Relevant domain knowledge is necessary to explain the rules, so as to make it more understandable.

Observation  I n d i v i d u a l  V a l u e   UCL  LCL    Figure 2. Scheme for discretization of parameters  4.1.6. Verification of association rules. Consult the relevant experts in the field and use their experience and knowledge to verify the correctness of acquired association rules. Test data sets can also be used to verify the acquired association rules.

4.1.7. Application of association rules. Use the verified association rules to facilitate production process improvement and decision-making optimization.

4.2 Realization of IDOM   The negative selection algorithm was first used in [15] as a means of detecting unknown or illegal strings for virus detection in computer systems. A population of detectors is created to perform the job of antibodies.

These detectors are simple, fixed length binary strings.

A simple rule is used to compare bits in two such strings and decide whether a match has occurred. It is equivalent to a match between antibody and antigen.

In the IDOM, ARM is combined with negative selection algorithm for on-line diagnosis of exception and dynamic optimization of process control system.

The basic idea is as follows: firstly the RFED generated in ARM stage is directly used as detector of negative selection algorithm. Since all the rules in RFED sets are verified during the ARM stage, RFED set doesn?t have any detectors that match the normal states (self). Then IDOM uses RFED set to inspect on- line real-time monitoring data, any activation (matching) of RFED indicates exception. Finally RFPO is used to optimize parameters of the remaining processes of the process system. The key steps are as follows:   4.2.1. Data coding. The original process monitoring data are usually continuous real variables, and the RFPO, RFED also need to be recoded to facilitate measurement of matching degree. So data coding is necessary, the coding scheme, as shown in Fig. 3 is adopted to conform with process control methodology and to facilitate utilization of association rules.

The number of sections for discretization should be equal to the number of sections in ARM stage. The   Figure 3. Schematic diagram of the data coding     coding value is determined by the deviation of the data from the control center.

4.2.2. Detector matching. RFED generated by ARMM is utilized to inspect on-line monitoring data, any activation (matching) of RFED of the process system is considered as exception. This study adopts partial-matching strategy, which requires more than 30% of successive bits to be matched. IDOM conducts real-time inspection and matching calculation for each process. Its advantage is quicker response to process exception that allows for dynamic adjustment.

4.2.3. Process optimization. It is necessary to find the corresponding RFPO (antibody) when abnormal is detected. IDOM selects the best RFPO by measuring affinity between RFPO and RFED like antibody selection in natural immune system. Here, RFED is equal to antigen, and RFPO is equal to the antibody.

Measurement of RFPO needs to consider not only its affinity with RFED, but also the difficulty level for adjustment of process parameters. Therefore, the affinity measurement should include two factors: ? the degree of similarity between RFED and RFPO, denoted by FS, the more similar between two strings, the lower adjustment costs for process parameters, and the greater for the affinity; ? the deviation of RFPO from the control center, denoted by FC, the closer RFPO from the control center, the easier to adjust parameters and the greater for the affinity. The affinity, denoted by F, can be calculated from (4) to (6):  1 ( )j j jF FS FC= +                          (4)    n RFED RFOP  j i i i  W FS p p  n = = ??                 (5)   n RFOP  j i i n k  W FC p  k = ? + = ?                     (6)  ( )Optimum jF MAX F=                        (7) In the equations, i is the process serial number,  i=1,2?n, n is bit size of the string, or the number of process parameters; j is the RFPO serial number, j=1,2?m, m is the number of RFPO; k is the number of unfinished processes, n-k is the number of finished processes; PiRFED PiRFOP is the ith discretization value of RFED, RFPO respectively; W1, W2 is the weighting coefficient of FS, FC respectively, in this study W1, W2 take 0.7,0.3 separately according to the experience.

For example, process system consists of 7 processes, {P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7}, as shown in Fig.

4. At time t, processes {P1, P2, P3, P4} are finished and the data returned is coded as {-2, 2, -3, 0}, and then         Figure 4. Scheme of immune optimization  detector matching is conducted, and is found to be matching with RFED-1 in the first 4 bits, so the process is abnormal. Then the best RFPO (antibody) needs to be selected from the RFPO set (including RFPO-1, RFPO-2 for this example). According to equation (4), affinity of RFED-1 with RFPO-1 and RFPO-2 are 0.71, 1.25 respectively. Affinity of RFPO- 2 with RFED-1 is bigger, therefore RFPO-2 is better than RFPO-1.

5. Case study   In order to validate the feasibility and correctness of the PQOM model proposed in the paper, the key technologies are validated by the data from a squeeze casting manufacturer that produces equipment outer covering with magnesium alloy by squeeze casting.

This case considers five influence parameters of three processes (preheating, filling and holding). To simplify the test, product weight is used as the quality evaluation index, denoted by p_weight. Table 1 shows the control specification and interval of discrete- sections for 3 parameters. For example, if molten temperature t_material is 708?C, then the discrete value is ?Center-High?.

Table 1.  Control specification and discretization of the parameters  t_material (?C)  t_mould (?C)  p_squeeze (MPa)  p_weight (g)  Discrete Value  <690 <440 <55 <3034 Very-Low 690-695 440-450 55-60 3034-3042 Low 695-700 450-460 60-65 3042-3050 Center-Low 700-705 460-470 65-70 3050-3058 Center 705-710 470-480 70-75 3058-3066 Center-High 710-715 480-490 75-80 3066-3074 High >715 >490 >80 >3074 Very-High          Figure 5. Part of excavated association rules Several excavated rules are illustrated in Fig. 5.

Adjustments are made according to the resulting association rules. Excavated association rules are divided into RFPO and RFED according to ?p_weight? (discrete value of product weight). If ?p_weight? = Center, then it is RFPO, such as rule ? in Fig. 5; if ?p_weight? is in {Very-Low, Very-High}, then it is RFED, such as rule ? in Fig. 5.

Rules like ? and ?, whose ?p_weight? are not in {Center, Very-Low, Very-High}, are just stored in database and not used in this research. It does not mean that these rules are not significant. These non- technological optimal parameters may be adopted when the process control parameters are considered comprehensively with other factors, such as cost, production rhythm and so on.

The dynamic control method is also tested by adding the code into the existing control system. The result shows the times that product weight exceeds specification reduces by 69.4% during the test period, thus the model is useful for optimizing the process system and product quality.

6. Conclusions and future work   PQOM based on ARM and immune principle is proposed to reduce process variability. This research presents how to find the implicit and hidden correlations in process systems by ARM technology and how to conduct dynamic optimization by utilizing negative selection algorithm inspired by natural immune system. Future studies may include research on more efficient ARM algorithm, method for intelligent evaluation of the excavated rules and application to more complicated process system.
