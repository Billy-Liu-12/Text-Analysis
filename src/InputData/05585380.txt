Laser-Based Tracking of Randomly Moving People in Crowded Environments

Abstract - This paper presents a people tracking system with multiple sensor nodes allocated in an environment. Each sensor node consists of a two-layered laser range sensor (LRS) that detects the positions of waists and knees of people. From the laser images of the people, heuristic-rule-based and global-nearest- neighbor (GNN)-based data association can identify a large number of people in crowded environments. The identified people are tracked via a model-based tracker; the interacting multiple model (IMM) estimator is applied to track people moving randomly and flexibly, such as walking, running, going/stopping suddenly, and turning suddenly. Simulation and experimental results validate our people tracking method.

I. INTRODUCTION  The tracking (i.e., estimation of motion) of multi- interacting people is an important issue for surveillance, security, service robotics, intelligent transport system, and many other applications. There has been much interest in the use of stereo vision or laser range sensors (LRSs). In this paper, we focus on laser-based tracking.

Compared with vision-based tracking systems, laser- based tracking systems are insensitive to lighting conditions and require less data processing time. Thus, a number of laser- based tracking systems have been developed in the past years [1?10]. In sparse environments, laser-based tracking systems can provide good accuracy; however, the tracking accuracy reduces in cluttered and crowded environments, where a lot of interactions and occlusions of multiple people occur. To address with this problem, multiple people tracking based on Bayesian filters, such as the Kalman filter and the Particle filter, has been achieved [5?10]. In addition, data association (one-to-one matching of tracked people and laser measurements), such as the joint probabilistic data association filter (JPDAF) and the multiple hypothesis tracker (MHT) [14, 15, 18], has been implemented for reliable tracking. However, the limitations of conventional laser-based people tracking  systems are inherent and evident.

Most laser-based tracking systems use a laser scanning in  a single plane and apply a leg tracking method, where people are represented by the states of their two legs; namely, a single augmented state or a high-level track in which two low-level leg tracks are associated. This approach makes it difficult to detect multiple people accurately in crowded environments.

Therefore, track lost often occurs. A typical solution to manage with this problem is to simultaneously detect different body parts of a person, such as legs and torso, using multi- layered LRS [11?13]. Moreover, by allocating multi-LRSs as sensor nodes at different positions in an environment, we can reduce occlusions of people in cluttered environments and improve the tracking performance [4, 6, 7].

Most conventional laser-based tracking systems based on Bayesian filter are built under the assumption that people walk at almost constant speed. Therefore, when people move randomly and flexibly, such as walking, running, going or stopping suddenly, and turning suddenly, the tracking performance significantly deteriorates. People typically move and act under the constraints of an environment, making human behavior strongly dependent on the location. For randomly moving people, a single model (constant velocity model) is insufficient to represent the people?s motion. A multi-model based approach in which different models run in parallel and describe different aspects of the people?s behavior is an effective technique to track randomly moving people; in the aerospace field, one of the typical multi-model based approaches to track maneuvering targets is the interacting multiple model (IMM) estimator [16, 17].

This paper presents a laser-based tracking system for randomly moving people in a crowded environment. Multiple two-layered LRSs are allocated at different positions in the environment. This detects different body parts of people simultaneously, thus allowing a robust detection of people.

The IMM based tracking enables tracking randomly moving people. This paper is organized as follows: Section II presents an overview of our experimental system. Sections III and IV    Proceedings of the 2010 IEEE  August 16-20 2010, Hong Kong and Macau                                                                                                             present our tracking method. Section V describes simulation and experiment to evaluate the tracking method, followed by our conclusions.



II. EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEM  Figure 1 shows our experimental sensor node. It consists of two LRSs (LRSH and LRSL). Each LRS captures distance samples by scanning a single laser beam in a horizontal plane.

Therefore, we construct a two-layered LRS by setting two LRSs at different heights. LRSH detects people?s waists and LRSL detects their knees. The view angle of the LRS is 180 deg. In our experiment, we allocate two sensor nodes in the environment.

Figure 2 shows the sequence of people detection and tracking. In each sensor node, we extract the distance samples (laser measurements) related to people on the basis of the background subtraction method from the laser images from LRSH and LRSL. The distance samples obtained from the same object have the same values, while those obtained from different objects are significantly different. Thus, the distance samples are clustered by checking the gap between two adjacent samples. Based on the sample clustering, we group the laser measurements and obtain the representative point of each group. We perform the clustering individually using each LRS.

The distance samples filtered in each sensor nodes are collected into a computer. Based on the distance samples, we detect people and identify them via the global-nearest- neighboring (GNN)-based data association [18]. The identified people are tracked based on the IMM estimator [16, 17].



III. PEOPLE TRACKING  A. Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) Estimator Based Tracking  We classify person motion into the following three patterns:  LRSH  LRSL  Figure 1. Experimental sensor node.

a) Constant velocity model (Model 1): Person moves at almost constant speed.

b) Sudden acceleration/deceleration model (Model 2): Person suddenly increases/decreases the speed and turns.

c) Stop model (Model 3): Person stops.

Motion equation of the three models is given by Eqs. (A.1)  and (A.2) in Appendix. We represent the motion equation of the n-th model, where n = 1, 2, 3, by the following vector form:  ),( 11 n t  n t  nn t ??? vxfx ? (1)  where Tnnnnnn vyx ),,,,( ?? ??x . ),( nn yx is the person?s position in a global coordinate frame, and n? is the moving direction of the person. nv and n?? are the linear and turning velocities of the person, respectively. Tnnn v ),( ???? ??v is the disturbance, which is assumed to be zero mean and having white noise sequence with the variance ),diag( nnv  n qq ??  ?Q .

For the Models 1 and 3, we set 1vq ,   ?? q , 3vq , and  ??  q at small values; for the Model 2, we select larger 2vq and   ?? q  than 1vq and  ?? q . In our experiments shown in Section V, we  set their variance at )/srad1.0,/sm1.0diag( 42421 ?Q , )/srad100,/sm50diag( 42422 ?Q , and )/srad1.0,/sm1.0diag( 42423 ?Q .

The LRS measurements give the waist (knee) positions of the person in the global coordinate frame by Tyx zz ),(?z .

The measurement model related to both LRSH and LRSL is  t n tt zHxz ??? (2)  where ?? ?  ? ?? ?  ? ?   H .

z? is the measurement noise, which is assumed to be zero     mean and having noise sequence with the variance R. In our experiments shown in Section V, we set the variance at  )m01.0,m01.0diag( 22?R .

Based on Eqs. (1) and (2), we track the person via the  IMM estimator [16, 17]. To track multiple people, as shown in Fig. 3, a validation region is set around the predicted position of each tracked person. The measurement inside the validation region is considered to come from the tracked person, and it is applied to the track update with an IMM estimator. As in Fig.

3 (a) and (c), in crowded environments, multiple measurements exist inside a validation region; multiple tracked people also compete for measurements. To achieve the reliable data association (matching of tracked people and measurements), we apply GNN [18, 19], in which a cost matrix based on the laser measurements (distance samples related to the people?s waists and knees) can be minimized.

The methods of setting the validation region and cost matrix are detailed in Section IV.

In Fig. 3 (b), person #1 matched with the waist measurement taken by LRSH is updated by the waist measurement. The person #2 that is not matched with any waist measurement is updated by the knee measurements taken by LRSL. In Fig. 3(b) and (d), person #1 matched with both the waist and knee measurements is updated using only the waist measurement.

B. Track Management Moving people always appear in and disappear from the  sensing area of the LRS. They also meet interaction and occlusion. In order to handle such conditions, we implement a track management system based on the following rules:  a) Track initiation: As shown in Fig. 3 (a) and (d), the measurements that are not matched with any tracked people are considered to come from new people or false alarms, which disappear soon. Therefore, we tentatively initiate tracking of the measurements with the IMM estimator. If the measurements are always visible in more than N1 seconds, they are considered to come from new people, and the tracking is continued. If the measurements disappear within N1 seconds, they are considered to be the false alarms, and the tentative tracking is terminated.

b) Track termination: When the tracked people exit the sensing area of the LRS or they meet occlusion, no measurements exist within their validation regions. If no measurements arise from the temporal occlusion, the measurements appear again. We thus predict the positions of the tracked people with the IMM estimator. If the measurements appear again within N2 seconds, we proceed with the tracking of objects. Otherwise, we terminate the tracking.

In our simulation and experiment described in Section V, we set N1 = 0.7 and N2 =1.2 by trial and error.

IV. DATA ASSOCIATION  A. Setting of Validation Region In this subsection, we describe the method of setting the  validation region. Based on the n-th motion model (where n = 1, 2, 3) of the person, the IMM estimator predicts the position of the tracked person by  )(  ??  n t  n  n t  n t  f  P  xH  xH  ?  ?

Tmn is the probability that the m-th model jumps into the n-th model, where m = 1, 2, 3 and n = 1, 2, 3. mtx? and  m t 1? ?? are the  state estimate and posterior probability of the m-th model.

As shown in Fig. 4, three circular regions with constant  radius r are set around the predicted positions, 1?tP , 2?  tP , and 3?  tP , of the tracked person, and their union is set as the validation region for the data association. In the simulation and experiment in Section V, we set the radius at r = 0.55 m for LRSH and r = 0.5 m for LRSL .

B. Calculation of Cost Matrix In this subsection, we describe the method for calculating  the cost matrix applied for GNN-based data association.

We consider that, in a validation region, I people exist and  J measurements are received, where I is not necessarily equal to J. The j-th measurements taken by LRSH are denoted by jtz , where Jj ,,2,1 ?? ; jtz is the waist position of a tracked person detected by LRSH, We then define the following cost matrix D:  ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  ?  IJII  J  J  ddd  ddd  ddd  ?  ????  ?  ?     D (4)  where dij is the Mahalanobis distance when the laser measurement zjt is matched with the i-th tracked person.

We achieve the data association so that the summed total distance of D can be minimized [18, 19].

The IMM estimator predicts the n-th model based position of the i-th tracked person. We therefore obtain the following distance:  )?()()?( 1 nitjt n it  Tn itjt  n pzSpz ??? ?? (5)  where n = 1, 2, 3. nip? is the n-th model based predicted position of the i-th tracked person. niS is the covariance of the prediction error )?( nij pz ? .

We define the Mahalanobis distance in Eq. (4) by dij = minimum ( 321 ,, ??? ).

When the tracked person is invisible by the LRSH, we determine the Mahalanobis distance based on the knee measurements by LRSL and achieve the data association.



V. SIMULATION AND EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS  A. Simulation Result of Single Person Tracking To evaluate the performance of the IMM-based tracking,  we perform a simulation tracking of a person moving at txt ?sin5.5? [m] and 0?ty [m], where ? is the angular  rate. The person is assumed to be always detected accurately.

The sampling period (scan) is 0.1 seconds. We set the transition probability matrix at  ? ? ?  ?  ?  ? ? ?  ?  ?  ?  9.005.005.0  05.09.005.0  05.005.09.0  T .

For comparison, we perform the Kalman-filter-based tracking; for the filter, we use only the sudden acceleration/ deceleration model (Model 2) and set the covariance at  )/srad120,/sm50diag( 42422 ?Q . The covariance value is chosen by trial and error such that it can provide the best tracking performance in the experiment shown in the following subsection.

We present Monte Carlo results using 50 simulations. To evaluate the tracking performance, we calculate the following normalized position error (NPE) [20]:  ?  ?  ?  ?  ???  ???  ?       ])()[(  ])?()?[(  i  yititxitit  i  itititit  t  zyzx  yyxx  NPE (6)  Here (xi , yi) is the true position of the person in the i-th simulation, where i = 1?50. (zxi , zyi) are the position of the person calculated from the sensor measurements. The values  )?,?( ii yx are the filter estimates.

From the definition of the NPE, the values below unity  signify good estimation; the smaller the values become, the better the tracking performance is. Table 1 shows the result; the time average and the related standard deviation of NPE in 20 seconds (200 scans). These results clearly indicate that the IMM-based tracking provides better performance than the Kalman-filter-based tracking does.

The people move randomly: sudden stop, sudden going, and sudden turning. Two sensor nodes are set in the environment; a fisheye camera is equipped with the sensor node #1 to evaluate the tracking performance.

We tracked the people in 45.3 seconds (453 scans). Figure 6 shows the tracking result. In the experiment, the rate of the people detection was 95.6%; the number of the track lost was just one, while misidentification never occurred.



VI. CONCLUSIONS  This paper presented a laser-based people tracking system for randomly moving people in crowded environments.

Multiple two-layered LRSs allocated at different positions in the environments allowed reliable detection of people. The IMM-based tracking algorithm enabled the system to track people moving randomly and flexibly, such as walking, running, going or stopping suddenly, and turning suddenly.

Simulation and experimental results validated our tracking method.

Our method presented in this paper was applied in a centralized architecture, where people?s images detected by multiple two-layered LRSs were collected into a computer and processed by it. Our research effort is directed toward a decentralized architecture; this provides a degree of scalability and robustness that cannot be achieved by a centralized architecture.
