The Application of Improved Incremental Updating Association Rule Mining  in Optimal Oxygen Content

Abstract   The determination of the optimal oxygen content is very important in power plant operation optimization.

Due to the disadvantages of traditional ways, this paper proposed a new method to decide the optimal oxygen content based on incremental updating data mining. This method could determine the optimal oxygen content and related frequent items by fuzzy quantitative association rule mining algorithm based on the unit history data. And the improved incre- mental updating mining algorithm was introduced into the mining process to avoid mining the whole database again when the history data were changed. So the mining efficiency is improved greatly. The analysis of the actual data of a 300MW unit shows that the coal consumption is decreased obviously by oxygen content optimization and the excellent performance is achieved.

1. Introduction   With the shortage of energy, operation optimization becomes more and more important. Oxygen content is strongly associated with other parameters in operation, so it can affect unit efficiency greatly. Finding optimal oxygen content is an important way to achieve economical operation [1-3].

There are several traditional ways to find optimal oxygen content such as designed value, thermal experiments, etc[4]. These values got by traditional ways are usually fixed value. And they don?t adapt to actual situation with the changing of unit state.

This paper found optimal oxygen content by data mining based on actual history data. The process was divided into two steps: Finding optimal value by fuzzy quantitative association rule mining algorithm; Upda- ting optimal value by incremental updating association rule mining algorithm . This method is more reasonable and accurate than traditional ways. At the same time, incremental updating mining can improve  mining efficiency greatly by avoiding mining old database.

2. Fuzzy quantitative association rule min- ing   Quantitative association rule are used to find corre- lations between quantitative attributes. In the rule representation, the consequent part was required to be a fixed value, and the antecedent part was composed of one or two quantitative attributes. However, it seems that such representations were restricted. Many methods divided the quantitative attributes into many crisp partitions and there were no intersections between the partitions. However, crisp partitions may be unreasonable for some situations. We found that the fuzzy association rules described by the natural language were well suited for the thinking of human subjects and would help to increase the flexibility for users in making decisions or designing the fuzzy systems. The fuzzy partition methods were thus used to find the fuzzy association rules. The detailed mining algorithm is described  in paper[ 5].

3. Improved incremental updating fuzzy quantitative association rule mining   This paper proposed improved incremental updating fuzzy quantitative association rule mining algorithm which could update old rules when database were changed. The kernel of updating association rule is to update frequent item kL . The process could be divided into two parts: the update of frequent 1-item and the update of frequent k-item (k>1).

(1) Update frequent 1-item  The process of updating frequent 1-item is shown in figure 1. Where D is primary database and d which contains p records is incremental database. kL ( 1k ? ) is frequent k-item generated from database D. 'kL is  2008 International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Design  DOI 10.1109/ISCID.2008.176   2008 International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Design  DOI 10.1109/ISCID.2008.176     frequent k-items generated from updated database D+d.

kw is the support of k-item in D, and 'kw  is that in d.

Figure 1. Brief procedure for frequent 1-items  Scan new items in d, and take out un-frequent items.

For items contained in 1L , scan d only to find if it is frequent. Then the time of scanning D is decreased greatly and mining efficiency has great improvement accordingly.

(2) Update frequent k-item (k>1)   Figure 2. Brief procedure for frequent k-item  The process of updating frequent k-item is shown in figure 2. M is the superset of items that contain in 1kL ? and not in ' 1kL ? .

' kC  is generated on the basis of  ' 1kL ?  by Apriori-gen Function. The support of k-item is calculated by formula (3) and (4).

(3) Flow of algorithm  Figure 3 is the flow of improved incremental updating fuzzy quantitative association rule. The input of the algorithm contains database D, new database d, minimum support s, minimum confidence c and all frequent items of D, that is kL .

4. The determination of optimal oxygen content based on data mining   The first step of data mining is the determination of mining target. Then correlative data can be collected   Figure 3. Procedure of incremental updating fuzzy  quantitative association rule mining accordingly. Different optimal oxygen content leads to different flue gas heat loss 2q , incomplete combustion heat loss 4q  and wind conveyer loss. At the same time, main steam flow and reheated steam flow are changed too. All these changes can be reflected by coal consumption rate of power supply. So this paper took coal consumption rate of power supply as mining target to determine the optimal oxygen content to achieve maximum  overall  performance.

Generally speaking, power production process was always dynamic. So we should choose data measured at steady working conditions before analyzing it. Main steam pressure was the most sensitive measuring parameter, so these working conditions could be considered as steady conditions when main steam pressure kept steady in a certain time. And detailed formula was shown in reference [6].

Pre-process these data which were correlative with mining target and which were measured at steady working conditions. Take out the exceptive data and fill up missing data[7]. Then normalize these data to needful format. And corresponding calculating formula was as follows:  ' ( min( )) /(max( ) min( ))i i i i iv v v v v= ? ?          (9) Where min( )iv  and max( )iv could be calculated automatically [8].

By analyzing history data measured at stable running state of a 300 MW unit, the optimal values of main controllable parameters related to operation optimization were mined out by association rule mentioned above.

A total of 5,760 transactions were obtained by analyzing the history data of the recent 4 months related to coal consumption. The parameters in the transactions consisted of load, excess air ratio and coal consumption rate of power supply. The association rules were derived from the data by data mining. The data of the first 3 months (contained 4,310 transactions) constituted database D, and the rest of transactions constituted new database d. And the minimum support was set at 30%. At the same time, the minimum confidence was set at 75%. Data mining algorithm mentioned above was applied to find the optimization values of oxygen content. The association rules mined from these data was expressed as <attribute: language value>, such as <O2: L1>, which was meant that the fuzzy mapping of oxygen content value located in partition L1.

Mining database D firstly by fuzzy association rule mining algorithm and standardizing these transactions to range [0,1]. And the parameters in these transactions were separated into fuzzy sets by membership function which was shown in Figure 4. The gradient and distribution are determined according to the characteristics of actual situation. According to the method mentioned above, by utilizing fuzzy association rule mining algorithm to mine the optimal value in a typical load range of 70%, 90% and 100%, then a set of optimal values is obtained. The optimal values obtained from fuzzy data mining and the reference values obtained in the traditional way were listed in Table 1. The frequent items produced during mining can be used to help incremental updating mining.

When new data were put into database, mining results should be updated. The process of incremental updating mining was as follows. (1) standardize new data to range [0-1]. During the process of standardizing these data, we still took the maximum and minimum of parameters in database D as maximum and minimum of that in new database. (2) Divide these data into fuzzy sets with the same membership function as mentioned above. (3) Mine new association rules by improved   Figure 4.  Membership function  incremental updating algorithm based on fuzzy quantitative association rule with the same minimum support and minimum confidence as mentioned above.

There were several rules during the incremental updating mining: The transactions frequent in both D and d must be frequent in updated database; the transactions un-frequent in both D and d must be un- frequent in updated database; the superset of transactions which is not belong to ' 1kL ?  must be un- frequent. So the candidate items produced during mining and the time of scanning D can be reduced greatly. Accordingly, mining efficiency has great improvement compared with mining all the data again.

In the association rules derived from updated frequent items, the intervals of the values of the parameters related to low coal consumption are chosen as optimal intervals. And the midpoint of the interval can be adopted as the optimal point to guide the operation, as shown in table 1.

Table 1. The comparison of designed value and optimal value of 300MW unit  Load/Me O2/%  Designed value  Primary optim- al value  Incremental updat- ing optimal value  210MW 4.15 4.18 4.29 240MW 4.00 3.93 3.93 270MW 3.85 3.77 3.77 300MW 3.75 3.61 3.61 From table 1, we concluded that the result of  incremental updating mining was different from primary result at the load of 270MW. It showed that incremental updating mining could find new rules when database were changed. Theory analysis showed that flue gas heat loss and wind conveyer loss would increase when oxygen content was too high. At the same time, hearth temperature would decrease which might cause combustion unsteady. While incomplete combustion heat loss would increase when oxygen content was too low. And too low oxygen content would cause upper shift flame center and more coking.

So there was an optimal oxygen content at a certain load. When unit worked in fully load condition, with the reduction of oxygen content, flue gas heat loss reduced and incomplete combustion heat loss raised.

While if only oxygen content was higher than 3.61%, the heat energy saved by the reduction of flue gas heat loss was higher than that wasted by the raise of incomplete combustion heat loss. And at the same time, wind conveyer loss was reduced. So optimal oxygen content should be controlled at nealy 3.61% in fully load condition. When unit worked at 210MW, with the raise of oxygen content, incomplete combustion heat loss reduced and wind conveyer loss raised. While when oxygen content was lower than 4.29%, coal consumption rate reduced with the raise of oxygen content. So optimal oxygen content should be controlled at nearly 4.29% at 210MW. Table 1 showed that the optimal target value of oxygen content got by     data mining was close to that got by designed value.

And the data trend of mining results was that optimal oxygen content was reduced with the raise of load.

This accords with theory analysis and mining results is good for energy saving.

Use history data to validate mining results. By analyzing 1462 transactions, we concluded that 36% of transactions were close to mining results shown in table 1 at least. There were at least 78% transactions whose oxygen contents values were close to mining results and whose support was higher than minimum support. Coal consumption in them was low. Analysis results were shown in table 2.

Table 2. The validation of the incremental updating  mining result with statistic analysis  Load/Me Number of  operation data Percentage% Condi- tion  A  Condi- tion  B  Condi- tion  C B/ A C/B  210MW 194 83 65 0.43 0.78 240MW 97 36 30 0.37 0.83 270MW 278 141 122 0.51 0.87 300MW 292 105 85 0.36 0.81  In table 2, A described the number of stable data and B described the number accord with optimal value shown in table 1. And C described the number of transactions that accord with B and has low coal consumption.

Table 2 shows that the optimal oxygen content got by data mining usually exists in ordinary operation, and the according coal consumption is usually low.

In order to improve the precision of incremental updating mining, membership function could be different at different load. The partition of membership function was decided by the parameters that owned minimum variation range. The method introduced in this paper was also suitable for the determination of optimal target value of other controllable operation parameters.

5. Conclusion   This paper proposed a new method to find optimal oxygen content based on incremental updating data mining by analyzing actual operation data.

Optimization results are better than traditional ways.

Incremental updating mining algorithm improves the mining efficiency greatly when the database is changed. The analysis of history data of 300MW unit shows that this method has greater efficiency and can guide operation optimization.
