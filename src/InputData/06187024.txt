Abstract?The high value of Radar and Lidar data for  understanding climate change and earth dynamics led to the  prioritization of the Deformation, Ecosystem Structure and  Dynamics of Ice (DESDynI) mission as Tier One in the last  National Academy of Sciences? Earth Science Decadal  Survey. A mission concept that matched those desired  objectives underwent pre-Project development and passed  several layers of review in late 2010 and early 2011 with the  target of a 2017 launch. However, cuts in the proposed  FY2012 budget forced a reset of the Radar mission and  eliminated the Lidar sciencecraft. The proposed DESDynI-  Radar mission may now fulfill a more limited set of objectives with a more modest budget on a longer  development timescale. A multitude of options have been  studied with varying levels of cost, risk and science value.

Flight and Ground system implementations have a direct  bearing on many of these factors and will also be addressed.

The methodology and status of evaluating these options will  be discussed. A key distinguishing characteristic of the  projected DESDynI-Radar measurement would be large  scale coverage and frequent revisit at fine resolution. This  would be enabled via a new Radar technique called  SweepSAR. Efforts to develop and field test SweepSAR will also be discussed, as well as other technology  developments underway that are associated with this  mission.
