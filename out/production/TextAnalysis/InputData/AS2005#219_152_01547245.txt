Abstract-In this paper, the data querying and the rough functional dependency of rough relational database are studied by granular computing and rough sets theory. First, the bit representations of granular computing are used in order to represent attributes values of rough relational database, and these equivalence granules (attributes values) are analyzed by rough sets theory. Second, data querying related to equivalence granules for rough relational database are discussed, we divide the data querying into two types: certain data querying and possible data querying, in addition, rough functional dependency based on bit representation is investigated and some important conclusions are presented.

I. INTRODUCTION J ough relational database model was introduced by  eaubouef Theresa and Frederick E.Petry, they defined the rough relational operators including difference, union, intersection, select, project, join and divide and discussed their properties[l][2].

The term "granular computing" (GrC) was first suggested by professor T.Y.Lin, which the basic idea of granular computing is problem solving with different granularities [3]. Granular computing may be viewed as a system of computing in which the objects of computation have a granular structure, with a granule defined by a generalized constraint. By construction, granular computing subsumes interval analysis, quantization and rough sets theory. With granular computing, the principal computational tool is the generalized extension principle [4].

T.Y.Lin introduced the machine-oriented model for data mining by the bit representations with granular computing in paper [5]. He used this method to investigate association rules and the primary objects he studied are relational database. In his granular relation theory, i.e., machine oriented modeling, primary processing unit is elementary granule, so a relation use  Manuscript received March 1, 2005.

granules (bit patterns) as attribute values is a model using entities as primitives, it is called a machine oriented model. In this model, attributes names and attributes values are the meaningful names of binary relations and elementary granules respectively.

Up to now, most of work related to rough relational database  is theoretical research, whereas only a few works deal with applications problems. In this paper, we use granular computing and rough sets theory to discuss the data querying and functional dependency of rough relational database.



II. BASIC CONCEPTS  Definition 1 The rough relational database has several features in common with the ordinary relational database. Both models represent data as a collection of relations containing tuples. These relations are sets. These tuples of a relation are unordered and nonduplicated. A tuple ti has the form (di,, di2, ...

, dim), where dy is a domain value of a particular domain set Dj.

In classical relational database, dije Dj. In the rough relational database, however, dy c Dj, and duI does not have to be a singleton, du. 0 [2].

Definition 2 Information granules are viewed as linked collections of objects (data points, in particular) drawn together by the criteria of indistinguishability, similarity or functionality. For an information system I=<U, A>, elementary granule is defined by EFK(u), where EFK(u) is a conjunction of selectors of the form Ai=Ai(u), 11 EFK(u)J'I= 11 AA4EK Ai =Ai(u) III, KcA, ue U,II*II is a function from 1D into power set 2u [6]-[10].

Definition 3 An interpretation a =(a,, a2,. am) of a  rough tuple ti=(di1,di2,...,dim) is any value assignment such that aje dy for all I < j< m, aj is called a sub-interpretation of du,.

Definition 4 A rough relation is a subset of the set cross product P(D1)x P(D2)x ...P(Dm)[2].

Definition 5 A binary granular structure consists of 4-tuple (V,U,B,C),where V is called the object space ,U is the data space, B={B',i=1,J...,n} is a finite set of crisp/fuzzy binary relation, and C is a finite set of concept spaces, each of which consists of all the names (attribute values) of the elementary neighborhood, B'p{ulu B' p}.When V=U and the binary relations are equivalence relations, i.e., B=E, then the triple (U,E, C) is called rough granular structure, where C, in this case, consists of the names(attributes and attribute values) of equivalence relations and equivalence classes ofE [11] .

III. GRANULAR REPRESENTATIONS OF ROUGH RELATIONAL DATABASE  In general, relational database is human oriented processing of massive data according to their semantics, e.g., attribute values are its primary processing units. On the other hand, data mining is machine derivations of hidden semantics, called patterns, from the mathematical structure of stored data, its primary processing unit is elementary granule, so a relation use granules (bit patterns) as attribute values is a model using entities as primitives, it is called a machine oriented model.In this model, attributes names and attributes values are the meaningful names of binary relations and elementary granules respectively.

Proposition 1 Given a rough relational database R, let t[AJ] and {x1,x2,..xJ} be R's arbitrary attribute value and a set of objects respectively. If t[AJ]exi Af t[A]j=1, then xi, R t[ A] l; jf  tAJ]EXiA t[AJ I>l,thenxi c R A.]' where 1<i.n, 1.-1.m, is the cardinal number of sub-interpretations.

Definition 6 Let BIT be a mapping function, BIT: M -*bin1bin2...bini...bin ILI, where MI{vvl..., vi, ...,vj,...vIq} is  the center of elementary granules, bini=1 if viE M, bini=O if vieM.

TABLE I: SUBREGIONS is modified from [1], it is a  rough relational database, follow we first analyze its granular representations.

TABLE I SUBREGIONS  OBJ ID COUNTRY FEATURE  xI U123 US {MARSH, LAKE} X2 U124 US MARSH X3 U125 US {MARSH, PASTURE,  RIVER} X4 U126 US {FOREST,RIVER} X5 U147 US {SAND,ROAD,URBAN} X6 U157 {US, MEXICO} {SAND,ROAD} X7 M007 MEXICO {SAND,ROAD} x8 M008 MEXICO BEACH xg M009 MEXICO SAND Xio C039 BELIZE JUNGLE xI] C040 {BELIZE, INT} {JUNGLE, BEACH,SEA}  As can be seen from TABLE I, the attribute value of ID is unique, so the COUNTRY and FEATURE are mainly discussed. Then, according to proposition 1, the following results are obtained:  R US {{XhX2,X3,X4,X5b} R us= {XjX2,X3,X4,X5,X6}, R MEXICO-IX7,X8,X9} R MEXICO-{X6,X7,X8,X9}, R BELIZE=IXO}, BELIZE=IXJ0,X1J}, R. MARSH1 X2}b R MARSH IX,X2,X31,  A LAKE=0, R LAKE-{Xj}, A PASTURE-, R PASTURE={X3} R RIVER=O R RIVER-{X3,X4}, R FOREST=4, R FOREST={ X4}S  RSSD={ X9}, R SAND=I{ X5,X6,X7,X9} L ROAD-, R ROAD={ XS,X6,X7}, A URBAN=0, R URBAN={ XS} R BEACeI X8}, R BEACH={ X8,X11}, R JUNGLE={Xjo}, R JUNGLE= X1O,XJI}, R SEA~= , R SEA={ Xjj}.

Each attribute value above is corresponding to an  equivalence granule and their bit representations are as follows according to definition 6:  BIT(R us)=I IIIOOOOOO, BIT( R us)=-1111I00000, BIT(R ACO)=0)OOOQO0111O0 BIT( R ssxco)=OOOOI II1OO, BIT(R BELIZE)=00000000010, BIT(R BELIZE)=OOOQOQOOO1IJ BIT( FM4RSH)=01000000000, BIT(R MARSH)=11100000000, BIT( R LAKE)=OOOOOOOOOOO0 BIT( R LKE)=10000000000, BIT( R PASTURE)=00000000000,  BIT( R PASTURE)=00100000000O BIT( R VER)=00000000000' BIT(R RIVER)=00110000000, BIT( R FOREsT)=00000000000, BIT( R FOREST)=00010000000, BIT(R sAND)-00000000100, BIT( R sAND)=000011O0100, BIT( R ROAD)=-00000000000, BIT( R ROAD)=-0000110000, BIT(R URBAN)=00000000000, BIT(URRBAN)=00001000000, BIT(R BEACH)=0OOOOOOQ1OOO BIT(R BEACH)=00000001001, BIT( R juNGLE)=00000000010, BIT( R JUNGLE)=-0000000001], BIT( R SEA)-=0000000000, BIT(R SEA)=QOOOOOQOO 1.



IV. DATA QUERYING OF RoUGH RELATIONAL DATABASE BASED ON BIT REPRESENTrATION  Rough querying is the operation which make use of    indiscernibility relation to finish. In fact, in the rough relational database model, a query returns a rough relation based on indiscernibility relation of attribute values. The rough relation is composed of a low approximation, or those tuples which are certain responses to the query, and an upper approximation, tuples which are possible responses to the query [1].

Given the granular representations of attributes values, we can query them further. Here we divide the querying based on bit representations into two types.

1) Certain data quemng is that search these objects fully matching the querying conditions, and the querying results are obtained by the low approximation of attributes values. For example, ifwe query those COUNTRY equal to US in TABLE I, we can use R us whose BIT( R us)=l 1111000000 to obtain the querying result, i.e., {x1x2,x ,x4xs} ifwe query the objects set that COUNTRY is equal to US and FEATURE is equal to MARSH, then we can take the intersection of two bit representations, namely BIT( R us) r) BIT( R mARsH) =1 1 1100 OOrOn 01000000000 = 01000000000 and the result set is {x2}.

The certain data querying is based on the proposition  R (XnY)= R (X)rn R (Y) of rough sets theory (Proposition 2.2,4)---[12]), then we will obtain the following proposition according the above conclusion.

Proposition 2 The result of certain data querying is the minimal set that satisfies querying conditions, the result can be represented as { t[AJ]lt[AJ]eR Al t[AJ]l=l , where I.i.n, 1.].fm, R is a rough relational database, . is the cardinal number of sub-interpretations.

2) Possible data querying is rough querying and the querying results are obtained by the upper approximation of attributes values. For example, ifwe query those COUNTRY equal to US in Table I, we will use R us whose BIT( R us)=I 11111000000 to obtain the result set is {X1,X2,X3,X4,X5,X6}; if we query the objects set that COUNTRY is equal to US and FEATURE is equal to AMRSH, then we can take the intersection of two bit representations with two upper approximation of attributes values, namely BIT( R us) r) BIT( R MARsH)= 1 1111 1O00000r) 11100000000= 11100000000, the result set is { XI,X2,X3}.

The possible data querying is based on the proposition  R (XnY)Y R (X)ri R (Y) of rough sets theory (Proposition 2.2,8)--[12]),so the following proposition can be obtained according to the above conclusion.

Proposition 3 The result of possible data querying is the maximal set that satisfies querying conditions, the result can be represented as {tAJIt[Aj]eR Al t[AjI >l }, where 1. i .n, 1<j< m, R be rough relational database, 0/is the cardinal number of sub-interpretations.



V. RoUGH FUNCTioNAL DEPENDENCY OF RoUGH RELATIONAL DATABASE BASED ON Brr REPRESENTATIONS  Definition 7 Two sub-tuples X=(ddx1,d.r) and Y= (dNl, d.2,...,d,,) are redundant if [dLxj=[dyj]I  Definition 8 Two sub-tuples X=(dx1,dx2.d) and Y=(dy1, dy2, ...,dy,,) are roughly-redundant if for some [p] c [dj] and [q]5[dyj],[p]=[q]forallj=I,2,...,m [1].

Definition 9 A rough fumctional dependency -? Yfor a relation schema R exists if for all instances T(R),  (1) Foranytwotuplest,t'E RT, redundant(t(X)t'(X)) -+redundan(t(Y)t(Y)),and  (2) For any two tuples s,s' E R T, roughly- redundant (s(X),s'(X)) --roughly-redundant(s(Y),s'(Y)) [1].

For a rough relational database, the judge ofrough functional dependency requires to use equivalence relation. Assume that each attribute value is only included in one equivalence class, then we can have following equivalence classes in TABLE I:  U/ID {{xI} , {2}, {IX}, {X4}, {X5}, {X6}, {X7}, {X8}, { x9}, {xjo}, {xll} },  U/COLUNTRY={ {XJ,X2,X3,X4,XS}, {X6}, {X7, X8, X9}, {Xjo}, {X/1}}, U/FEATURE={iXI}, {X2},{JX31} {X4}, {X5}, {X6, X7}, {X8}, {X9},  {XJo}, {X]]} }.

According to the theory of functional dependency, ID Rl- COUNTRY and ID - FEATURE hold. Further, we can obtain the following conclusion.

Proposition 4 Let t[AJ], t[AJj be two attributes values belong to Xand Yrespectively, x is an object ofR, ifthe following two conditions satisfy,  1)Ifxe tAi, thenxe Rt[Aj , 2)Ifxe R4Ai],thenxE R4Aj]  the rough functional dependencyX Y-y holds.

Definition 10 (redundant factor) For definition 9,we call the  similarity measure between t(X)and t'(X) as antecedent lower redundant factor, denoted as a, we call the similarity measure between t(Y) and t'(Y) as consequent lower redundant factor, denoted as ,B,so the definition 9 (1) can denote as Xa,- Yp.

Similar, we call the similarity measure between s(X) and s'(X) as antecedent upper redundant factor, denoted as a', the similarity measure between s(Y) and s'(Y) as consequent upper redundant factor, denoted as f3',so the definition 9 (2) can denote asXa'4  card(t(X) r) t'(X)) card(t(Y)n t'(Y)) card(t(X)u t'(x)) card(t(Y)u t'(Y))  Where a , EE [0,1], and card( denotes as cardinal number ofthe set, the definition of a',l is similar as a ,/5.

In above example, {US} and {US, MEXICO} is roughly- redundant, and aW=1/2=0.5,{ SAND,ROAD } and { SAND, ROAD,URBAN } is roughly-redundant too, so / t=2/3.

For rough functional dependency, we have following conclusions:  Proposition 5 For a RRDB, if its arbitrary tuples t= (d1,, dm2,...,dm) and t=- (dy1,dy2, ...,dym) is tuple-redundant, then they must be roughly-redundant. If t,t' is roughly-redundant, it's unnecessarily tuple-redundant.

Proposition 6 In rough functional dependency Xa -* Yp and [12] Z. Pawlak, "Rough set: Theoretical Aspects of Reasoning About Data,"Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers, l991,pp.12.Xaf R )YW, if a=1 then fl=1,but when a'=1,/3'is unnecessarily equal to 1.

Proposition 7 Dissimilar antecedent attributes values don't influence the dependency.

Proposition 7 is determined by the properties of functional dependency itself.



VI. CONCLUSION  In this paper, the bit representation of granular computing and rough sets theory are used to study the data querying and rough functional dependency ofrough relational database. Data querying related to equivalence granules for rough relational database are discussed, we divide the data querying into two types: certain data querying and possible data querying, in addition, a new judge method of rough functional dependency based on bit representation is given. In the future, we will research the theory and applications of rough functional dependency deeply.
