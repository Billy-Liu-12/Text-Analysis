Unveiling Fuzzy Associations Between Breast Cancer Prognostic Factors

Abstract?Breast cancer is the second most common cancer worldwide and the fifth most common cause of cancer death.

There are many prognostic factors associated with breast cancer which are usually considered when determining how cancer will affect a patient. In addition, distinct molecular subtypes of breast tumors have been described by gene expression profiling. In this work we integrate information from the main prognostic factors in breast cancer with whole-genome microarray data to study the potential associations between these two types of data. The heterogeneity and noisy nature of the data along with its high dimensionality make necessary the use of data mining techniques to analyze the dataset. Fuzzy sets are particularly suitable to model imprecise and noisy data, while association rules are very appropriate to deal with heterogeneous and high dimensionality data. Thus, a fuzzy association rule mining algorithm was used to carry out this study. Many interesting associations have been obtained. Further studies and empirical evaluation of these associations are needed to obtain scientific evidence of such relations. Finally, a freely accessible web application has been developed which implements the fuzzy association rule mining algorithm used in this study (http://genome.ugr.es/biofar).

I. INTRODUCTION  THERE are many prognostic factors associated with breastcancer. The most widely used are primary tumor size, the lymph node status, the tumor histological grade, and tu- mor receptor status (hormone receptors and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, HER2) [1]. Furthermore, HER2, estrogen receptors (ER), and progesterone receptors (PgR) play an important role in the development and progression of breast cancer. The response to endocrine and targeted anti- HER2 therapy (Trastuzumab therapy) depends on the presence of ER and PgR, and HER2 overexpression respectively [2], [3].

In addition, several molecular subtypes of breast tumors have been described by gene expression profiling. These molecular categories represent biologically distinct disease entities which correlate with biomarker phenotypes and show differences in clinical outcome [4]?[8]  So far, to the extent of our knowledge, there does not exist any work which studies the relations between the above  F.

mentioned prognostic factors and whole-genome expression data. In this work, we integrate information of these factors with whole-genome microarray data to study the existing as- sociations between these factors and gene expression profiles.

The heterogeneity and huge dimensionality of the dataset (several thousands of variables) make necessary the use of advanced data mining techniques. In this sense, association rules have recently emerged as a powerful tool to analyze bi- ological data, due to their ability to manage large datasets, their capacity to treat heterogeneous information and the intuitive interpretation of the results obtained with this technique. Thus, association rules have been widely used in bioinformatics, their applications spanning from pure data mining approaches to signaling pathways inference, protein-protein interaction prediction or regulatory modules discovery [9]?[12].

Moreover, biological data and particularly gene expression information are known to be imprecise and noisy. Classical crisp techniques are usually applied to analyze this type of data [13]?[15]. However, other methods which are known to perform better when dealing with imprecise and noisy data (e.g. fuzzy techniques) are barely used [9]. Hence, in this work we make use of a fuzzy association rule mining algorithm to carry out the above mentioned study. More concretely, we developed a freely accessible web application which allows to run a fuzzy association rule mining algorithm over a given data table (http://genome.ugr.es/biofar). With this application we try to encourage the use of fuzzy techniques in biomedicine and bioinformatics by providing a tool which allows the study of the existing relations among a high number of variables.

The application presents a simple interface with explanatory documentation, aiming to provide a tool easy to use by any person not necessarily close to computer science.

A. Microarrays  Microarray technology makes use of the sequence resources created by the genome projects and other sequencing efforts to monitor the expression of thousands of genes in particular cell samples, times and conditions. Thus, microarray data provide a global picture of the cell activities and open the way to a high-level understanding of its behavior.

The results of a set of microarray experiments are usually organized in the so-called gene expression matrices. Rows (columns) in these matrices represent genes, and columns (rows) the experimental conditions under study. Thus, each cell in the matrix contains the expression level of a gene  20th International Workshop on Database and Expert Systems Application  DOI 10.1109/DEXA.2009.36     under a certain experimental condition. The analysis of these matrices allows to get information about cellular operation in organisms. However, this analysis is very complex due to the large number of genes (even in the simplest organisms) and the noise that affects the whole process [16].

B. Association Rules  In 1993, Agrawal proposed an algorithm for extracting association rules from large databases [17]. Since then, as- sociation rule mining has become one of the main techniques for Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD).

Given a transactional data base, where each transaction is a set of attribute-value pairs or items, the aim of these techniques is to find a set of expressions of the form X ? Y , where X and Y are sets of attribute-value pairs or itemsets. This expression is called association rule, and indicates that if X occurs then Y is likely to occur. The probability that Y occurs, given that X has occurred, is called the confidence of the rule.

The probability that both X and Y occur is called the support of the rule. Thus, classical association rule mining algorithms aim to extract association rules with support and confidence greater than some user-specified threshold.

C. Fuzzy Association Rules  Fuzzy set theory was proposed by Zadeh in 1965 to math- ematically model the imprecision inherent to some concepts [18]. Briefly, fuzzy set theory allows an object to partially belong to a set with a membership degree between 0 and 1.

Likewise, fuzzy logic allows a statement to be true with a certainty degree between 0 and 1. Classical set theory and logic are special cases of their fuzzy counterparts in which membership and certainty degrees are restricted to either 0 or 1.

Traditional quantitative association rule mining methods partition continuous domains into crisp intervals. When di- viding an attribute into intervals covering certain ranges of values, the sharp boundary problem arises. Elements near the boundaries of a crisp set (interval) may be either ignored or overemphasized [19]. Fuzzy association rules overcome this problem by defining fuzzy partitions over the continuous domains. Moreover, fuzzy logic is proved to be a superior technology to enhance the interpretability of these intervals [20]. Hence, fuzzy association rules are also expressions of the form X ? Y , but in this case, X and Y are sets of fuzzy attribute-value pairs and fuzzy confidence and support measure the significance of the rule.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: sections II-A, II-B, and II-C describe the data included in the analysis.

Section II-D describes the fuzzy association rule mining methodology. Finally, section III describes some of the ob- tained results and section IV provides some conclusions and future works.



II. METHODS  Data were supplied by one of the Spanish National Cen- ters for HER2 testing (Hospital Universitario Virgen de las  Nieves). Gene expression data, tumor stage, histology and immunohistochemical markers were recorded for 38 tissue samples.

A. HER2 Testing Methodologies  The evaluation of HER2 status is a critical test for de- termining which patients are eligible for being treated with Trastuzumab. Moreover, the College of American Pathologists has recently recommended that HER2 status should be deter- mined for all invasive breast cancer [21]. HER2 gene status of breast tumors was evaluated by both immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of paraffin-embedded tissue on conventional slide using FDA approval kits. HER2 test results were interpreted according to manufacturers? test kit protocols.

IHC was scored on a qualitative scale from 0 to 3 depending on the staining intensity: IHC0 and IHC1 were considered as IHC negative, IHC2 as equivocal, and IHC3 as positive.

Cytoplasmic staining was considered to be non-specific. Het- erogeneous HER2 staining pattern in different areas of the same tumor was also considered as an additional variable in the study.

FISH results were calculated as the average ratio of Her2/neu signals to CEP171 signals in non-overlapping in- terphase nuclei of the lesion. Tumors with a Her2/neu:CEP17 ratio ? 2 : 0 were considered positive for gene amplification.

This test also allowed a simultaneous determination of the number of chromosome-17 copies. An additional variable was also included in the study indicating whether there exists polysomy for chromosome-17. Polysomy was defined as the occurrence of three or more copies of chromosome-17.

B. Immunohistochemical Data  The ER and PgR expression was quantified in our laboratory using the Allred scoring which is a microscopic method conveying the estimated proportion and intensity of positive tumor cells (range from 0-8). Values of the Allred index values over 3 were considered as positive samples.

The expression of p53 and ki67 mitosis marker was assessed according to the estimated proportion of nuclear staining in tumor cells that were positively stained. For p53, values over 5% were considered positive. For ki67 percentage values two fuzzy sets were defined as shown in Figure 1(a) according to expert knowledge, since percentages around 10% are in the border between positive and negative cases.

C. Microarray data  Total RNAs were extracted from 35 frozen breast tumor tissues and 3 normal breast tissues using Trizol (Invitro- gen,Carlsbad, CA). After quality control using a Bioanalyzer (Agilent 2100), RNAs were amplified, labeled, and hybridized onto whole genome microarrays U133 plus 2.0. according to Affymetrix protocol.

After all this process the raw gene expression values were obtained for each of the 38 samples. As commented above,  1Chromosome-17 centromere Enumeration Probe     (a) ki67 staining percentages (b) Gene expression levels  Fig. 1. Fuzzy set definitions for (a) variable ki67 and (b) the gene expression values  microarray experiments inevitably introduce many sources of variation. A normalization step is essential to correct the effects of systematic sources of variation of non-biological origin. The well-known robust multiarray analysis method (RMA) [22] was used to normalize the set of microarray experiments. Relative expression levels were then obtained by dividing each normalized value by a reference expression level and calculating its logarithm base-2 as shown in (1):  Expr?i,j = log2(Expri,j/ref valuei), (1)  where:  ? Expr?i,j represents the relative expression level of gene i for sample j,  ? Expri,j represents the normalized absolute expression level of gene i for sample j,  ? ref valuei represents the reference expression value for gene i. The three samples obtained from normal breast tissues were considered as the reference samples. Thus, for each gene i, a reference value was calculated as the median of the expression values of gene i for these samples.

We then removed those genes which did not change their expression level more than 0.5 fold in at least the 0.1% of the samples under study (flat genes). After filtering out these genes, we finally obtained a gene expression matrix of 35 rows (one for each tumor tissue), and 4857 columns (one for each remaining gene).

Finally, the fuzzy definitions of over-expression and under- expression were done as shown in Figure 1(b), taking into account that it is usually accepted that genes which change their expression level more than one fold with respect to the control sample are over/under-expressed.

D. Extracting the Fuzzy Association Rules  At this point we had a gene expression matrix and a data table containing the information of the prognostic factors. Both tables were then combined thus forming a final data table of 35 rows and 4868 columns. This data table can be easily seen as a transactional database where each gene (i.e. row) represents a transaction and the values in each column form the items of the transaction. Thus, the fuzzy association rule mining algorithm was run over this data table in order to obtain the set of potential relations. Table I shows a summary of the studied variables.

It implements a fuzzy version of the efficient Top-Down Frequent-Pattern Growth algorithm which has previously shown a good performance over this type of datasets [9]. Initially, the algorithm scans the database in order to get a list of all the frequent items, i. e. items with support greater than a threshold. Then, the items in this list along with their membership degrees for each transaction are introduced into a data structure called Fuzzy Frequent-Pattern Tree (Fuzzy FP-Tree). The efficiency of the procedure relies on the use of this tree, since the algorithm condenses in this data structure all the information it needs from the transactions. Thus, the Fuzzy FP-Tree is traversed in a top-down manner in order to obtain the set of frequent itemsets. Once the set of frequent itemsets is obtained, fuzzy association rules are generated from each itemset by following an straightforward procedure [17].

Fuzzy support and confidence were calculated as described in [23]. In addition, in order to avoid some of the drawbacks of the confidence/support framework, certainty factors were used [23]. Given an association rule X ? Y , Equation 2 is employed to calculate the certainty factor value.

CF (X ? Y ) = conf(X ? Y ) ? supp(Y ) 1 ? supp(Y ) , (2)  where conf(X ? Y ) represents the confidence of the rule, and supp(Y ) represents the support of the consequent. Only association rules with support, confidence and certainty factor greater than some user-specified thresholds were generated.

Further details about the algorithm can be obtained in [9], [24].

In addition, in order to provide a global significance value of the obtained rule set, we estimated the number of rules that were obtained by chance. For this purpose, given the support, confidence and CF thresholds, we first extracted the association rules from the data table setting these thresholds.

A new data table was then built considering the genes that appeared in the rules. We generated 100 randomized inde- pendent datasets from this new table. The estimated number of false rules was calculated as the mean of the number of rules obtained from each of these 100 randomized datasets.

This way, we calculated a False Discovery Rate (FDR) which allowed us to check the quality of the rule sets [25].

III. RESULTS  A number of rules were obtained relating the gene expres- sion levels and the prognostic factors. CF, Confidence and Support thresholds were set so that the FDR was low and that the number of obtained rules could be easily analyzed by the expert. A value of 0.7 was finally selected for the CF threshold and a value of 0.2 was set for the support threshold. Thus, 90 rules were obtained relating prognostic factors and expression values. An FDR value of 0.14 was obtained, therefore very few rules were generated by chance and the vast majority of them may represent real biological associations. It is not the aim of this study to give a comprehensive list and biological interpretation of all of them, but to get a first impression of the potential relations hidden in the dataset. A deeper analysis of the rules will be the topic for future works.

A sample of the obtained rules will be commented in this section (see Table II). These rules were selected ac- cording to expert knowledge and information extracted from the literature. Association rules with more than one item in the antecedent/consecuent were also obtained and will be considered in future works. Complete rule sets are provided on request.

Some interesting rules were found relating PDZK1 and GREB1 with the ER index (see Table II). Previous works described a significant correlation between PDZK1, GREB1 and the ER phenotype in breast cancer cell lines [26]. PDZK1 and GREB1 have been proven to be estrogen-regulated genes expressed in hormone-responsive breast cancer. Moreover, GREB1 has been shown to be a critical regulator of hormone- dependent breast cancer growth [27]. Supporting this last affirmation appear not only the rules associating GREB1 with the ER and PR indexes, but also a rule stating that samples with down-regulation of the GREB1 gene tend to present high proliferation rates (ki67 positive staining in tumor cell).

Two rules in Table II associate IHC3 samples and heteroge- neous patterns with LEP down-regulation. The rule involving the IHC3 is particularly interesting due to its high support (0.31), confidence (1.00) and CF (1.00) values. It is notewor- thy the presence of this gene in the rule, since it has been  previously related with poor-prognosis and decreased disease- free survival in breast carcinoma patients [28].

Another interesting rule is the one involving the PTHLH gene and ?metastasis?. The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the parathyroid hormone family. This hormone regulates endochondral bone development and epithelialmes- enchymal interactions during formation of the mammary glands and teeth. Some articles have reported that PTHLH may play a role in metastasis of breast cancer and prostate cancer cell lines by up-regulation [29], [30]. Nevertheless, in our results, PTHLH down-regulation appears associated with metastasis samples. It is difficult to explain this fact, it could be that cancer cells produce PTHLH to prompt cancer cell migration and invasion, but when the metastasis process is finished PTHLH is no longer necessary and so was down- regulated in the metastasis group [31]. Future studies may clarify the role of PTHLH gene in breast cancer metastasis.

Of particular interest is also the rule between ANKRD30A (NY-BR-1) under-expression and samples with tumor stage

III. Previous works described the over-expression of this gene in primary stage breast cancer tumors [32]. Hence, it is par- ticularly interesting the association found between its down- regulation and tumor stage III. Moreover, this rule presents quite high levels of support (0.31), confidence (0.98) and CF (0.96).

The following three rules in Table II associate MED1, GABRP and TPR with FISH positive samples. Fluorescence in situ hybridization of human chromosomes revealed that the MED1 gene is located on chromosome 17q12 near HER2 [33].

Around a 30% of the tumors included in the analysis showed HER2 amplification, thereby justifying the appearance of this rule. GARBP down-regulation has been previously related with breast cancer. Moreover, in silico analysis described it as a candidate gene differentially expressed in breast cancer [34].

No works were found in the literature which can confirm the associations between GABRP, TPR and FISH-positive cases.

An analogous situation occurs with the next two rules in Table

II. These rules involve genes NPY1R and IGF2, which have been previously associated with breast cancer in the literature [35], [36]. However, no bibliographic evidence was found regarding their potential relation with high proliferation rates.

Further studies and empirical evaluations are thus necessary to confirm these rules, since these genes might be useful as novel prognostic markers in breast cancer.



IV. CONCLUSIONS  An integrative and multi-disciplinary approach is presented in this work to study potential relations between prognostic factors and whole-genome expression data in breast cancer.

The heterogeneity and noisy nature of the data along with its high dimensionality decided us to use of a fuzzy association rule mining algorithm for the analysis.

A number of interesting associations have been found in this first approach. A deep study and empirical evaluation of the rules is however needed to confirm such associations.

Finally, a web application was developed which aims to spread fuzzy techniques by providing a tool which helps to     analyze heterogeneous and high dimensionality data. This web application has been shown to be very useful in the development of this work and future studies will include enhancements of this software.
