The Project Risk Assessment based on Rough Sets

Abstract? The risk assessment of project is the important  content for project management. This paper combines rough sets  theory and neural network. Using the calculation method for  reduction of rough sets theory method, we can obtain the  compendious attributes and rules from sample data, then  according to the attribute which had been reduced develop the  neural network. The model overcomes the shortcoming that  when neural network inputs too much dimensions, the structure  of the network is too big. This method makes the neural network  structure simple. The results of matlab simulation show the  superiority of the model. The model based on rough sets and  neural network can effectively help project managers for management of project risk.

Key words: rough sets, neural network, risk assessment

I. INTRODUCTION  Project risk assessment is the most important part in the risk  management. Identifying the project risks is the first step in  risk management. Risk assessment is on the basis of risk  identification; determines quantitatively the size of project risks  by risk analysis and the assessment, then understands the  potential severe impact of the project risk to the project goals.

Risk assessment plays an important role, specifically in the  following ways: (1) it is an important basis for policy-making project. Policy-makers? ignorance of the risks in the project  implementation process and the existing possible consequences  could cause failure of the project. (2) It is an important basis  for selection of risk management policy in the project  implementation phase. In the process of project  implementation, managements may make a risk decision based  on the results of the evaluation of project risks.

Risk assessment usually used the scale of the risk to  measure project risk, risk scale is defined as: R=f (p, q), of  which: R: risk scale; p: risk events probability; q: the impact of  the project risk when the risk occurs. Usually the method of quantifying the risk is very subjective, and that is closely  related to the evaluation criteria for risk and the ability of the  incident forecast and its affordability. In this paper, the risk  assessment method on the basis of using the rough sets to  reduce redundant attribute, develops a neural network to  evaluate the risks avoiding the subjective effort, and also  combines the merit of rough sets and neural network advanced  algorithm. The model can evaluate the project risk more  effectively, reasonably and more scientifically.



II. THE THEORY OF ROUGH SETS AND NEURAL NETWORK  Poland scholars Z. Pawlak proposed the theory of rough  sets that can simulate human abstract logic functions and  analyze incomplete and uncertain data, and can also discover  and extract knowledge. As a new mathematical tool for describing uncertainty and incomplete information, it has been  a hot academic spot of artificial intelligence. Rough sets can  analyze data, and then extract the rules from the data for  forecasting and decision-making. But rough sets model is a  structured and non-numerical information processing method.

It is suitable for processing discrete data, not continuous data [1].

The neural network is an effective method for data mining  and classification, but its application is impacted by its ?black  boxes character? to a large extent. So how to reduce the black  boxes character of neural network and extract the rules of semantic have become the concerned issues to the people.

The rough sets can reduce the input neurons of the neural  network to simplify network topology structure, which can  compensate the black box character to a certain extent.

Accordingly, we can train samples with the combination  method of the rough sets and neural network to reduce the  surplus attributes and extract the most optimal rules, and then  the number of neural network nodes of the input layer is the  number of optimized attributes. We can get a new rough neural  network, which settled the problem of too big nodes [2].



III. PROJECT RISK ASSESSMENT MODEL  A.  Attribute Reduction Based on Rough Sets  1) Establish knowledge representation system (1) Knowledge representation system: uses sample data to  establish the initial knowledge expression system:  S=<U,C,D,V,f>. U is targeting domain; C D=A is attributes  set, C={xi} is condition attributes, D={y} is decision attributes,  V Vr r A  = ?  is the set of attribute value, Vr is the range of  attribute values for attribute r A , that is the range of r  attribute; f:U?A V is the information function, which has  designated each object attribute value x of U.

(2) Discernable matrix: suppose ( )a x jk  is the value on the  atturibute ak of the sample x j . ( )M s mij n n =  ? is the     discernable matrix ,of which the elements of ith row and  column j is :  , ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )  , ( ) ( )  a C a x a x D x D x k k i k j i j  m ij D x D x  i j ?  ? ? ? ?  ? 1-1  2)  Discretize the values of continuous attribute Rough Sets can only deal with uncertain and discrete data,  when the attribute values of the information table are  continuous, we must discretize them first. The principle of  discretization is: the space dimension is as small as possible after attributes discretization, that is, the types of attribute  values should be as few as possible; and lost information  should be minimized [3-6].

3)  Reduction of Attributes (1) Dealing with redundancy attributes: reduction is defined as  minimum conditions attribute set which doesn?t contain  redundant attributes and ensure the classification is correct. For  attributes c={x1 x2 ? xn}, if (c)-(xi)= c, ?xi? can be  omitted in the c, otherwise ?xi? cannot be omitted in the c, that  is, if you wipe ?xi? from condition attributes, the  incompatibility rules will not be present in the rule sets, then  ?xi? is a redundant attribute, and it can be omitted.

(2) Dealing with incompatible rules: Knowledge representation  system S=<U,C,D,V,f>, the confidence of decision rules is:  ( ) min  x D k kwi  CF x k  x k wi  =                              (1-2)  Of which ?xk? is the kth (k = 1, 2? n) rule; Dk is the type of  decision attributes of the kth rules; ?wi? is the categories of the  ith condition attributes. (i = 1, 2,?, n).

B. Assessment with Neural Network  1)  Develop the neural network In this paper the structure of the neural network is made up  of three layers: input layer, hidden layer and output layer.

Robert Hecht Nielson has proved that as long as this function is  continuous in the closed interval, and the number of neurons in  the hidden layer is enough, it can use the network structure  with only one hidden layer to approximate to arbitrary accuracy. So this paper only takes one hidden layer. The first  layer is the input layer, the number of neurons in this layer is  the number of the condition attribute in the simplest decision  attributes table, the second layer is the hidden layer, and the  number of the neurons in this hidden layer is determined by the  following formula:   n i k Cn  i <  = or, h m n a= + + or, lg 2h n=                 2-1  , of which ?k? is the number of samples, and ?n? is the number  of neurons in input layer, ?m? is the number of neurons in  output layer, ?h? is the number of neurons for hidden layer, ?a?  is the constant between 1 to 10. The third layer is the output  layer; we will get the result through the network calculating.

Because output has only one indicator project risk coefficient,  the number of neurons in the output is 1. In this paper, the  coefficient of project risk is defined as ?the probability of  project risks? multiplied by ?the ratio of impact of risk to the  project and the total value of the project?. Namely  R=p*q/v(0<R<1). Of which, R=project risk coefficient; ?p? is  the probability of occurrence; ?q? is the loss value caused by  risk; ?v? is the total value of the project.

2)  Network Learning This paper adopted RBF algorithm based on the gradient  descent, and the rules of network learning are as follows:  (1) Initialization, assignment value for each value of connected  weights wij , v jt , threshold value j? t? with random values in  interval (-1, l).

(2) Provide a group input vector of sample  ( , , ... )1 2 k k k  P a a ank = and target vector of sample  ( , , ... )1 2 k k k  T y y yqk = which is selected randomly.

(3) Calculate each element input in the middle layer with the  input sample ( , , ... )1 2 k k k  P a a ank =  connecting weights wij  and  threshold value j? , and then calculate each element output b j in  the middle layer through the transfer function.

n s w aj ij j j  i ?= +  = , 1, 2, ...j p=                       2-2  ( )b f sj j= , 1, 2, ...j p=                                  2-3  (4) Calculate each element output in the output layer with the  output b j and connecting weight v jt and threshold value t? ,  and then calculate each element responses Ct  through the  transfer function.

n l v bt tjt j  i ?= +  = 1, 2, ...t q=                         2-4  ( )c f lt t= 1, 2, ...t q=                                    2-5  (5) Calculate each element error kdt  with network objectives  vector ( , , ... )1 2 k k k  T y y yqk = and the actual network output Ct .

( ) (1 ) k k  d y c c ct t t t t= ? ? 1, 2, ...t q=                2-6  (6) Calculate each element error ke j  in the middle layer with  connecting weight v jt and error k  dt  in the output layer and  output kb j in the middle layer.

[ ] (1 )  q k k  e d v b btj jt j j t  = ? =  2-7  (7) Using each element output error kdt  and each output in the  middle layer amends connecting weight value v jt  and  threshold value t? .

(8) Using each element output error k  e j  and element each input  ( , , ... )1 2P a a an=  amends connecting weight value v jt  and  threshold value t? .

( 1) ( ) k k k k  w N w N e aij ij j t?+ = ?                       2-10  ( 1) ( ) k k k  N N ej j j? ? ?+ = ? , i l n, j 1, 2 P= ? = ? 2-11  (9) Randomly select the next vector sample for learning network, and return to the step (3) till the completion of the  training m samples.

(10) Randomly select a group of input samples and objective  sample from m samples, return to the step (3), until all the  network errors E is less than a predetermined minimum, that is,  network convergence. If the time of learning is more than the  predetermined value, network will not be able to converge.

(11) Study concluded.

Step (7)-(8) are the process of network error back-  propagation; step (9) - (10) complete the process training and  convergence [7-12].

3) Project risk Assessment Put the project risk sample data into the trained neural  network, and then we can get an output value. Compare the  output value with the risk coefficient, and we can complete the  evaluation of projects risk.



IV. THE SIMULATION  A.  Obtain Initial Knowledge Representation System  This paper gives the table of project risk factors based on  the historical data of project management and the knowledge  and experience of project risk management experts, and then  develops the two-dimensional decision table which can be  processed by rough sets. Take an ?IT? project for example, the  project risk factors are summarized as the owner risks,  operational risks, the ability risks, development risks, and  technical risks, as shown in table [13].

TABLE I. PROJECT RISK FACTORS  No The source of risk  A owner risks  demand-orientation risk A1  environment risk A2  consciousness risk A3  B operational risks  strength of developer B1  mature product experience B2  quality control B3  C ability risks  communication channel C1  project management process C2  project organization C3  D development  risks  project assessment D1  project plan D2  employee flow D3  E technical risks  technology platform(E1)  development tool E2  maintenance ability E3  In order to better explain the application of the model based  on the rough sets and neural network in assessment of project  risk, we take an assumption that these risk factors data have  been discretized and normalized. As shown in table . A1 is  demand-orientation risk, A2 is environmental risk, A3 is  consciousness risk ??and D is decision attributes that  represent risk level. The value of each attributes is 1, 2, 3.

Respectively, endow each value with certain significance, for  example, Project plan (D2) and development tool E2 . ?1?  shows that project plan is detailed, ?2? shows that project plan is primary, ?3? shows that there is no plan. Tools ? ?1? says that  development tools are very advanced, ?2? says that the  development tools are general, ?3? says that tools are very  backward. Risk level ? L represents risk rating is low (0-0.3),  N represents risk level is general (0.3-0.6), H says that the risk  level is high (0.6-1).

Attributes Reduction  Attribute reduction is the core issue of optimizing neural  network with rough sets. In this paper preprocessing of data  adopts a two-dimensional data reduction method, and then  reduces redundant attributes and eliminates noise samples  through rough sets. We can reduce unnecessary condition  attributes from the decision table. This paper gets the reduction  of attribute using the software ROSETTA with SAVGenetic  Reduce (Genetic algorithm). The result of reductions are {A2,  C1, D3, E1, E3}, {A2, A3, B3, D3, E2},{A2, A3, C1, D3,  E3},.......After calculation and selection, the best reduction of  attributes is {A2, C1, D3, E1, E3}.

C. Develop RBF Neural Network  The paper adopts three layers RBF neural network to  develop nonlinear system model. Because there are only 5  attributes left after reduction, the number of input nodes is 5;  the number of hidden layer nodes for RBF network is  determined by the formula (2-1), therefore the number of hidden layer neurons is 7; output indicator is the project risk  coefficient, therefore the output layer has one node. This paper  establishes the structure of RBF network model which is 3 ? 7  ? 1. In order to train neural network facility, we use neural  network toolbox provided by MATLAB which contains many  subroutines procedures which can be called as needed.

D. MATLAB Simulation  Put the risk data into matlab for network training. In the  experiment we set the rate of learning is 0.01, the biggest  training step is 2000, and error accuracy is 0.001. The paper  adopts the algorithm which can amend the rate of learning by  itself. Use the same procedures to simulate both the reduced  attributes and initial attributes, then compare and analyze the  results, as shown in Figure 1 and Figure2.

Figure 1. the error convergence of neural network simulation  Figure 2. the error convergence of rough sets and neural network simulation  From the simulation results we can see the simulation result  of reduced indicators and initial indicators are basically  consistent. We can get the conclusion that the model based on  rough sets and RBF neural network can be used in project risk  evaluation, and is even more effective. The method is better  than simple neural network evaluation.



V. THE END  This paper presents a model based on rough sets and neural  network. The character of the model is it integrates the  advantages of knowledge abstracting of rough sets and  numerical approximation of neural network. Meanwhile it  overcomes the shortage of rough sets that is it can not deal with  the continuous data, and improves the speed of neural network  training. After simulation by matlab, examples have  demonstrated the model can not only reduce the number of  input layer neurons, simplify the network structure, but also  improve the learning efficiency on the condition that it can  maintain a relatively high accuracy. After comparison with the network without reducing attributes and analyzing the result,  it?s proved that those are basically consistent. The model is  feasible and effective. Although simulation has proved that the  model based on the rough sets and neural network can be  applied to the assessment of project risk, there are still  questions: it lacks strict theoretical derivation for discretion  processing of continuous data, and how to ensure the accuracy  of sampling information needs further study.
