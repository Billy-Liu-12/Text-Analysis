Research on the Extension of Attention Set for User Focused Frequent Itemset  Mining

Abstract?High frequent network request pattern in office automation system (OAS) can be described as high frequent itemset when association rule discovery technology is used to mine high frequent network request patterns with network log file as raw data. To mine high frequent network request concerned by user (or manager), attention set is used to describe the focus of user during the mining of high frequent network request. In this paper, extension method is discussed for the extension of attention set and extension method based on the co-occurrence of item pair (network request behavior pair) is presented. Experimental results show that the performance of our proposed method is better.

I.  INTRODUCTION In OAS, user behaviors such as network access request  from users in network can be recorded in log files of gateway and router of the network for the OAS. Network manager can mine user?s network request pattern from those network log files [1~5]. And with user?s network request pattern, whether user?s network surfing is associated with office affair can be judged. Because data in those network log file is massive, association rule discovery is usually used in the mining of user's network request pattern from network log file [1,6-8].

To mine user focused network request patterns [8] as association rule discovery quickly and accurately, early selection model for information filter mechanism of attention and evaluation method with precision ratio and recall ratio as criterion are research on our research [9]. In this paper, extension method of attention set for user focused high frequent itemset mining is discussed. Extension method of attention set is shown at part II. Definitions about precision ratio and recall ratio are introduced at part III. And experimental results are shown at part IV. Our future works are drawn at part V.



II. THE EXTENSION OF ATTENTION SET Usually, elements of attention set in user focused  frequent itemsets mining can be specified by specialist or extracted from history data of user?s attention. Two cases may happen. The first is that some elements in attention set  may not be real itemset in transaction set and the second is that some itemset which is not concerned by user may be co- occurring with some itemset which is concerned by user. The happening of first case means that the size of attention set may be less than expectation and the happening of second case means that the attention set may be expanded if the size of attention set is less than expectation.

Let event e=<id, name> where id ? ?  is the identification of e, ? is the indicator set and name is the name of event e. And let 1 2{ , ... }mF f f f=  be the attention set, fj=<idj, namej>, j=1?m. As to association rule discovery, if 1 2{ , ... }nI i i i=  is the full itemset and  a F a I? ? ? ? , the first case is happening. If a is synonymous with c and c is one event in I according to one thesaurus dictionary D, c is denoted as c=D(a) and c can be into attention set F as the representation of a. The alternative process is one kind of extension of attention set F.

Algotithm1: the extension of attention set F based on  thesaurus dictionary Input: thesaurus dictionary D, user attention event a, full  itemset I Output: user attention even c 1) if a I?  then c=a  else 2)      1 2{ , ... } ( )mC c c c D a= = 3)     select c from C where thesaurus(a,c,D) is maximum  in  each thesaurus(a,ci,D),i=1,2?m 4) return(c)   In algorithm1, function thesaurus(a,c,D) is for the  measuring the synonymous degree of a and c in D. More synonymous degree a and c in D is, more less the thesaurus(a,c,D) is. Because it is difficult for the construction of thesaurus dictionary D, algorithm1 could not be widely used in practices.

If the difference between the expected size of attention set and the size of F?I is k, k items in full itemset I can be inserted in to F if the occurrence frequency of those k items in transaction set T are top k. As to a F? and b I b F? ? ? , if the occurrence frequency itemset (a, b) is large, b can be insert into attention set as one user?s concerned event.

Output: the co-occurrences frequency of (a,b) in T 1)  Let cnt=0 2)  For each t in T 3)        If  both a and b in t  then cnt=cnt+1 4)  co_occurrence(a,b)=cnt   Algorithm3: the extension of attention set Input: Attention set F, full itemset I, extension  coefficient k the co-occurrence function co_occurrence() Output: U, the extension set of attention set F 1)   Let U be the extension set of attention set F and U ?= 2)     If F I ?=?  select i1,i2?ik from full itemset I where the frequency of ij in T is jth,j=1,2?k U={ i1,i2?ik }  3)     else 4)       U F I= ? 5)       for each element pair (a,b) where a in F and b in I 6)   if co_occurrence(a,b), the frequency of itemset (a,b)  is one of top k frequency then { }U U b= ? 7)    return U   In algotithm2 the value of function co_occurrence(a,b) is  the frequency of 2-itemset (a,b). Because the frequency of (a,b) is high where a is one element of attention set, b can be added into the extension attention set although item b is not in initial attention set.



III. THE EVALUATION OF METHOD FOR USER?S NETWORK REQUEST PATTERN MINING  Let ? be one association rule mining algorithm, ij=<idj, namej> be jth event, 1 2{ , ... }nI i i i=  be the itemset of all items,  1 2 { , ... }  m F f f f=  be the event set where each event in F  should be paid attention by user, 1 2  { , ... } r  FS fs fs fs=  be  frequent itemsets discovered by ?. If j  fs F ??? , fsj is one user focused frequent itemset.

Let ? be one association rule mining algorithm, A be the set of all high frequent itemset mined by ? from transaction set T, Sa be minimum support. And let B be the set of all high frequent itemset in transaction set T with Sb as the minimum  support. If recall(?, Sa, Sb)= B?A  B , recall(?, Sa, Sb) be the  recall ratio of ?.

Let ? be one association rule mining algorithm, C be set  of all user focused high frequent itemset mined by ? from transaction T with Sc as the minimum support, A be set of all  high frequent itemset mined by ? from transaction T with Sa  as the minimum support. If precision(?, Sc , Sa)= C  A ,  precision(?, Sc , Sa) is the precision ratio of ?.



IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND ANALYSIS In our research on user focused frequent itemset mining,  raw data is from network log file in gateway for Anhui Provincial Key Laboratory of Intelligent Building. With the log file, original transaction set with 76026 items and 31658 transactions is constructed. The table for those transactions storing has 4261578 records. Because the goal of our research is to find high frequent network request from end user in our laboratory, the expectation for elements number of in our attention set is 200 and there are 100 network requests as elements in initial attention set. With algorithm5, the initial attention set is expanded. And ultimately, there are 200 elements in attention set for the mining of high frequent network request.

To obtain data for table2, User focused high frequent Items are mined by algorithm2 and extension attention set is used. In our experiment, minimum support is varied from 10% to 100%. According to the definition of precision ratio and the principle of algorithm2, the precision ratio of algorithm2 for the mining of user focused frequent itemset should be 100% and the conclusion is verified with data in precision column of table2. In talbe2, the recall ratio of algorithm2 is higher and the value of recall ratio is not less than 78% when the minimum support is increased from 10% to 100% and the average of recall ratio is not less than 90%.

Performance on precision ratio and recall ratio for user  focused frequent itemset mining based on different attention sets are show at figure1. In figure2, the recall ratio based on initial attention set is varied from 36.34% to 100% when the minimum support is increased from 10% to 100% and the     average of recall ratio is about 86.87%. Meanwhile the recall ratio based on extension attention set is varied from 78.87% to 100% when the minimum support is increased from 10% to 100% and the average of recall ratio is about 90.94%. It is obvious that user focused frequent itemset mining based on extension attention set is better than user focused frequent itemset mining based on initial attention set although precision ration of them are both 100%.

V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK To mine user focused frequent itemset, the focus of user  is described with attention set in our research. Element in attention set is item if user focused frequent itemset is mined by association rule discovery technology. Item can be event in dynamic system and elements in attention is usually appointed by user or specialist. Method for the construction of full attention set based on little items/events as initial user's attention appointed by specialist/user is our work in this paper. Extension method based on the co-occurrence of item pair is proposed. User focused frequent itemset mining based on extension attention set is better. The generalization and migration characteristic of attention will be two important factor in our future method on attention based data mining.
