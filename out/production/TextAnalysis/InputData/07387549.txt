I.  INTRODUCTION Apriori algorithm is a classical algorithm of association  rule discovery in data mining,1993 by Agrawal, imielinski and Swami presents the concepts of association rule mining,1994 Agrawal and Srikant proposed Apriori algorithm[1],used to find interesting association rules or relationships among the data items in a given data set. Table 1 is an example of a supermarket shopping basket [2], Each row in the table corresponds to a transaction that contains a unique identifier TID  and a collection of goods purchased by the customer.

TABLE I.  SHOPPING BASKET  TID  Commodity collection 1 {Bread,Milk} 2 {Bread,Diaper,Beer,Egg} 3 {Milk,Diaper,Beer,Cola,Salt} 4 {Bread,Diaper,Beer} 5 {Bread,Milk,Diaper,Salt}  ?? ??  The following rules are obtained by using Apriori  algorithm:   {Diaper}?{Beer} [support=2%,confidence=40%],   The rule's support support=2% shows that 2% of  customers are buying diapers and beer,and the credibility of confidence=40% means that 40% of customers who buy diapers are also buying beer.To help decision makers to design, discover new cross marketing opportunities or to develop other related business decisions through the discovery of association rules.

Intrusion detection system (IDS)by scanning of the operating system audit data or network data packet information detection not authorized or illegally entering the user behavior of the system, the system by means of system audit records, analysis and detection of network traffic to identify system in the presence of the illegal invasion, and timely manner to determine, record and alarm, the system managers to take timely and effective measures to make up for the loopholes in the system[3].



II. BASIC CONCEPTS  A. Association Rule Association rule is "if...... So......" Form, to get the useful  rules, it also needs to be two and rules related to the important information support, rules of probability is how much credibility rules right what is the probability. Support is a measure of the importance of the association rules, which shows that the association rules in all transactions are much more representative, the more support, the more important the association rules. Credibility is a measure of the accuracy of the association rules, although some of the rules of the association rules are very high, but the degree of support is very low, indicating that the association rule is very small, so it is not important.

____________________________________    Definition1 Set },,,{ 21 mIIII is a collection of  data items, D  transaction is a collection of all,A transaction T  has a unique identifier TID .If items,transaction support items claimed T  set A ,also known as T  transaction that contains the item set A .

Definition2 Association rules are shaped like BA type of implication, among them IA , IB ,and  BA .

Definition3 BA  supports the association rule is  defined as  %100)(sup)(sup N  BAport BAport ,  credibility is defined as:  %100 )(sup  )(sup)( Aport  BAportBAconfidence .

Usually user according to mining need to specify minimum support degree (min_sup) and minimum confidence (min_con), minimum support degree describes the association rules of the lowest degree of importance and minimum confidence provides rules must meet the lowest possible. In fact, we are only interested in the association rules that satisfy the minimum support and minimum confidence level, This is called the strong association rules.

Definition4 If a k  item set, its support degree >=min_sup, then calls the k  item set for the frequent k  itemsets, the collection of all frequent k  itemsets kL .

B. Apriori Algorithm Apriori algorithm is based on the fact that the algorithm  uses a priori knowledge of the frequent item sets, using an iterative method called "layer by layer" search, and the k  set is used to explore the )1(k  set. First, we find out the collection of 1 frequent itemsets, which is denoted as 1L . 1L  is used to find a collection of 2 sets of 2L , while 2L  is used  to find 3L ,so it cannot be found in the k  set, the specific description is as follows[4]:  In: Database D and supmin_ , Out: Database D itemsets L ,  Algorithm:  1L = Looking frequent two sets( D );  For k =2; 1kL ; k ++  { kC =apriori_gen( 1kL );  For each transaction Dt  { ),( tCsubsetC kt ;  For each candidate c tC  countc. ;}  kL =( |kCc countc. )}  Return L ={All kL }.

Algorithm for generating candidate k  itemsets is:  apriori_gen( 1kL :frequent(k-1)-itemsets)  For each itemsets 11 kLl  For each itemsets 12 kLl  If ])1[]1[(])2[]2[(])1[]1[( 212121 klklklklll  Then  { 1lc 2l ;  If has_infrequent_subset ),( 1kLc Then delete;  Else add c  to kC ; }  Return kC .

C. Bottleneck of Apriori Algorithm  In search of 1 sets,2 sets......, k  sets, each mining a layer of kL ,to scan the transaction database D  again[5], k     second scan, get k  sets, due to D  in a short period of time with little change or no change, do is repeat scanning. When the transaction database D  is large, the overhead of Apriori algorithm is relatively large, which is to reduce the I/O overhead. The Apriori algorithm is improved in this paper.



III. IMPROVEMENT OF APRIORI ALGORITHM  A. Ideas In view of the deficiency of Apriori algorithm, based on  relational algebra theory, the relationship matrix and correlation operation are obtained by Optimization Relation Association Rule(ORAR) [6], this algorithm only needs to scan the database once, and overcomes the shortcoming of the Apriori algorithm which needs to scan the database for many times.

Definition5 },,{ 21 mtttT  is transaction data collection, },,{ 21 niiiI  is a collection of data items, the relational matrix R  is defined as  )     item      in   the     appearsnot    dit               Item(0  )      item     in   the    appears          Item(1 ][  kj  kj  kj ti  ti rR  Among them mk ,,2,1 , nj ,,2,1 , R  is the T  to I  matrix, That is  mnmm  n  n  rrr  rrr rrr  R     ,  The value of ijr  is 0 or 1, indicates that the i  transaction  data contains or does not contain j  data item.

Data item  , table 1 of the shopping basket transaction is converted to the corresponding relationship matrix R   .

Definition6 According to relational matrix R , the  support for the j  data item as the 1 set is m  r m  i ij  1 ?100%.

B. ORAR Algorithm  In:Database D and supmin_ , Out:Database D itemsets L , Algorithm:  1a =find_frequent_1-itemsets( R ); For i =2; i < n ; i ++  {    For Each frequent  itemsets  niiii cccc 112111 ,,, For h =1; h <= n ; h ++ For j =1; h <= m ; j ++  Calculation 1iijc  r  and jhr ;  If hc ji ,1  support degree>=min_sup  Then hccc iiii ,,,, 121  is a i  set  For each i  item set jijjj cccc ,,, 21 For k =1; k <= m ; k ++  If i  item set jc  support degree>=min_sup  Then out i  item set jc  }.



IV. APPLICATION OF IMPROVED ALGORITHM IN INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM  In order to improve the efficiency of the Apriori algorithm and the classical Apriori algorithm, the experiment is done under the same support with different data and the same amount of data.

Experimental environment: Intel Core I3 CPU 3.1GHz, memory 3G, hard disk 320G; Microsoft Windows 7 system; algorithm with Java7.0 SQL Server 2008 implementation.

Experimental data sets from ?KDDCUP.data_10_percent? data sets of KDDCUP99 subsets [7], 494021 records the subset data is Wenkole etc. after further processing of these raw data obtained, they use bro preprocessing of the raw data packets, thus the network data processing into connection records, with 41 attribute values and a attack class type     identifies the feature set, we selected the 18 main attribute [8].

The minimum support degree was 15%, the minimum feasible degree is 50%, respectively in 5000, 10000, 50000, 100000, 200000 and 400000 data set experiment, by Figure1, you can see, when test data is small (5000), improved algorithm ORAR advantages nature of the obvious, when the sample number is gradually increasing, the superiority of the algorithm ORAR began to manifest.

With a sample data set (100000) respectively with minimum support degree s=10%, s=20%, s=25% and s=30% experiment, from Figure2 can be seen, with the minimum support increases, the execution time of the Apriori algorithm and the ORAR algorithm gradually declines.



V. CONCLUDING REMARKS This article in the analysis of mining association rules of  the classical algorithm Apriori and improved algorithm ORAR. Through simulation experiments to compare the two algorithm execution time, discusses the data sample size and minimum support degree of two algorithms performance effect. The experimental results show that application of improved algorithm ORAR can effectively improve mining  frequent item set efficiency, improve the performance of intrusion detection system.
