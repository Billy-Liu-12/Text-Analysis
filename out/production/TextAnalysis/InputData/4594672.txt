Identifying Insightful Salinity and Temperature Variations in Ocean Data

Abstract   Global ocean salinity and temperature variations are attracting increasing attention as scientists are trying to extract more knowledge from collected ocean data to better understand global change. Association rules mining can be applied to ocean salinity and temperature data to discover spatial-temporal patterns that reveal salinity and temperature variations. Since we are addressing the associations of salinity/temperature events among different time and locations, the events can be grouped into clusters before mining starts, and the discovered association rule that has its antecedent and consequent from different clusters will be of most interest. However, are the discovered rules important or insightful? In this paper, an importance measurement for association rules with antecedent and consequent from different clusters is proposed. The importance measurement quantifies the rule?s antecedent and consequent impact to their clusters, respectively. A rule is insightful if its importance measurement is above a predefined threshold. The insightful rules can then be presented to experts for further analysis.

1. Introduction   Knowledge about the variations in ocean salinity and temperature may help us understand ocean circulation and its role to climate change. This can be achieved by employing data mining methods to discover interesting salinity and temperature patterns and then subsequently using these to predict future salinity/temperature events. For example, one can convert ocean data into market-basket type transactions and then apply association rules mining techniques to discover interesting associations.

However, the patterns that are discovered by traditional association rules mining algorithm only show salinity/temperature variations that occur simultaneously. It would be helpful if the rules can reveal associations among variations that occur at different times or at different places. Tung et al.

proposed efficient algorithms for finding such rules [9].

In [9] a sliding window is applied to the transaction database to form mega-transactions, and then the inter- transaction association rules are discovered. This type of rule reveals associations among transactions and not within transaction. They can therefore be used to show spatial-temporal relations in ocean data that are collected globally for a given time interval.

Ocean data measurement collections can be huge; hence, large quantities of rules will be generated. Some of the spatial-temporal patterns may not be useful even though their support and confidence values exceed pre- defined thresholds [1]. Because the intention is to find associations of salinity/temperature events at different times and in different locations, the events can be grouped into clusters by either the location or time of an event, and the discovered association rules that have antecedent and consequent from different clusters will be more interesting than those that have antecedents and consequents from the same cluster. Formally, let  },...,,{ 21 neeeI = be a set of n distinct events and D be a set of spatial-temporal transactions over I. The spatial-temporal pattern that events in A belong to spatial-temporal clusters  events in B to spatial-temporal clusters  and  is  particularly interesting. However, is this rule insightful even it is strong? In this paper, an importance measurement for association rule is proposed.

In section 3 the proposed algorithm is described and section 4 provides experimental evidence. Section 5 concludes the paper.

2. Problem definition   This section describes problems associated with mining inter-transaction association rules and insightful measurement of rules. Some definitions will also be given before describing the proposed algorithm.

2.1. Argo data and transactions in Argo data   The goal of this study is to find the ocean salinity and temperature relations in the waters surrounding Taiwan. The data for our analysis are taken from Argo ? a global array of 3,000 free-drifting profiling floats that measures the temperature and salinity of the upper 2000m of the ocean [5].

Association rule mining algorithms assume that a finite set of disjoint transactions are given as input to the algorithms [2, 8]. However, there may not be an explicit finite set of transactions in a spatial data set.

This study adopts the strategy proposed in [8], where the spatial transaction is defined around the instances of a special reference feature. Taipei is chosen as the reference site and concentric circles are used to define neighboring regions of the reference site. Fig. 1 shows this reference centric model. The concentric circles are also used to annotate the location of the events. The sub-zones defined by the concentric circles represent different distances and directions to the reference site.

For example, sub-zone A2 implies that it is in the east- northeast direction far from Taiwan, and sub-zone A1 is in the east-northeast direction close to Taiwan. Thus, the location context information for those variations is maintained. Fig. 2 shows how the set of all the variations within the concentric circles are treated as a single transaction. Table 1 lists some of the transaction data derived from Argo measurements. Each transaction is recorded with its spatial/temporal information. The transaction that is transformed from Fig. 2 has transaction ID 2001/01 in Table 2.

2.2. Inter-transaction association rules  In this section, fundamental concepts and  definitions are introduced before presenting the proposed approach to inter-transaction association rules mining.

Definition 1. Let },...,,{ 21 uiiiI =  be a set of items.

Let D be a dimensional attribute and  be the domain of D. A transaction database is a database containing records in the form , where  )(DDom  ),( jId  )(DDomd ?  and . We call this type of  database a one-dimensional database.

II j ?  The dimensional attribute usually describes the item time or location.

An inter-transaction association rule that spans p intervals is found if an association exists between items that are p intervals apart. Since an inter- transaction association rule may cover many intervals, finding all such rules is time-consuming. In order to minimize the effort involved in mining uninteresting rules, a sliding window denoted by w is introduced.

When mining inter-transaction association rules, only the rules spanning shorter than or equal to w intervals are considered. The sliding window is thus used to avoid mining rules that span many consecutive intervals [3].

Each sliding window forms a mega-transaction. A mega-transaction M that is contained within W can be described as follows:  },10,1];[|)({ ??????= wjukjWijiM kk  where W is a sliding window with w intervals and u is the number of items in },...,,{ 21 uiiiI = .

To distinguish the items in a mega-transaction from traditional transaction items, the mega-transaction items are called extended items. The set of all possible extended items are denoted I ? . Given I and w, then:  )}.1(),...,0( ),...,1(),...,0(),1(),...,0({ 2211  ? ??=?  wii wiiwiiI  uu   The following is the definition of an inter- transaction association rule.

Definition 2. An inter-transaction itemset is a set of extended items IB ??  such that ukBik ???? 1, .

Definition 3. An inter-transaction association rule has the form , where YX ?  1. ., IYIX ???? 2. .1,)0( ukXik ???? 3. .0,1,)( ????? jukYjik 4. {}.=?YX     transaction database. Then, the support and confidence of an inter-transaction association rule  can be defined as:  YX ?  .

|| ||  , ||  sup x  xyxy  T T  confidence S  T port ==  (1)  As with intra-association rules mining algorithms, a minimum support, minsup, and a minimum confidence, minconf, are given and the task is to discover the inter- transaction association rules from the transaction database with support and confidence greater than or equal to the minimum requirements.

2.3. Association rules importance measurement   Zhang et al. proposed two strategies to measure the  importance of bridging rules [10]. The first one is joint-entropy-based strategy. The two measurements of this strategy are the similarity measurement for antecedent and consequent in their clusters, respectively, and the joint-entropy measurement that is the sum of their similarity measurements. The similarity measures the closeness relation between two contrasting sets of objects in a database. The larger the similarity is, the closer the object associated with objects in a cluster is, and the larger the entropy sum is, the more important the rule is.

The second strategy is based on mutual information where two entropy measurements are defined. These are the mutual information entropy and the conditional mutual information entropy. Let C1 and C2 are two conceptual clusters and  where  and is the bridging rule. X is the set of neighbors to z  },,{ 21 zzZ =  2211 , CzCz ?? 21 zz ? 1 and Y is the set of neighbors  to z2, where  The mutual information entropy Info(X|Y) is the sum of the information amount of X given Y. The conditional mutual information entropy Info(X;Y|Z) is the amount of mutual information of X and Y given Z. The value of change of the conditional mutual information entropy is defined as removing the mutual information entropy from conditional mutual information entropy. The larger the value is, the more important the rule is.

., 21 CYCX ??  The main idea of the above two strategies are to measure the impact of antecedent and consequent in their clusters, respectively. Since we are dealing with the associations of salinity/temperature events among different time and locations, the events can be grouped into clusters either by their time or locations.

Discovered association rules that have their antecedent  and consequent from different clusters may be more interesting. These rules may be even more insightful if the impact of their antecedent and consequent in their clusters are high. The details of how to measure the importance of a rule are given in the next section.

3. Mining insightful rules   The existing mining algorithms may face difficulties when discovering inter-transaction association rules. Tung et al. proposed a framework that can only discover inter-transaction association rules [9], whereas Srikant et al. proposed an approach to mine quantitative intra-transaction association rules [7]. In order to discover inter-transaction association rules, a new method is developed to extract rules from an one-dimensional transaction database.

The proposed process of mining inter-transaction association rules from an one-dimensional database can be divided into three steps: quantitative attribute transformation, the discovery of frequent inter- transaction itemsets, association rule generation and insight association rules identification.

3.1. Quantitative attribute transformation   The first step is to map each quantitative attribute into its intervals. Let },...,,{ 21 kiiiI = be the set of all items that belongs to the original database. For the sake of simplicity, it is assumed that the database only has one quantitative attribute, ij, where kj ??1 . If ij is mapped to l intervals, then the new set If of all items becomes  where i },,...,,,...,,,...,,{ 1),()2,()1,(21 kjljjj iiiiiii +  r, ,jr ?  is a binary attribute and are attributes that are transformed  from the quantitative attribute i ),()2,()1,( ,...,, ljjj iii  j.

3.2. Frequent inter-transaction itemsets discovery   Let If be the new set of all items that is defined from the previous phase and W be a sliding window with w intervals along the dimensional attribute. We now redefine a mega-transaction M contained within W to be:  }.10,in  attributean  is ],[|)({ ????= wtIitWitiM f The set of all possible extended items is then  redefined as:  )}.1(),...,0(),...,1(),...,0(  ),1(),...,0(),...,1(),...,0(  ),...,1(),...,0(),1(),...,0({   ),(),()1,()1,(   ??  ??  ??=?  ++ wiiwii  wiiwii  wiiwiiI  kkjj  ljljjj  f    Definition 4. Let MTxy be the set of mega- transactions that contains a set of extended items  YX ?  and MTx be the set of mega-transactions that contains X. Let S be the number of transactions in the     Furthermore, an inter-transaction k-itemset is the set  such that there at least exists one attribute  or attribute fIB ??  )0(ri .)0(),( Bi lj ?  In this step, the classical Apriori algorithm can be used to find frequent inter-transaction itemsets. Since the quantitative attribute transformations and inter- transactions results in large quantities of data, it takes longer to process. To solve the problem, one can employ a reduced prefix-projected itemsets method based on PrefixSpan algorithm to expedite the efficient search for the frequent itemsets. Pei et al. [6] employed a projection scheme in the PrefixSpan algorithm where the customer sequences (transactions) were projected into overlapping sets called projected databases such that all the customer sequences in each set had the same prefix that corresponded to a frequent sequence (itemset). The main idea behind PrefixSpan is that, instead of projecting sequence databases by considering all the possible occurrences of frequent subsequences, the projection is based only on frequent prefixes. This holds, because any frequent subsequence can always be found by growing a frequent prefix.

In this paper, the proposed approach adopts this reduced prefix-projected itemsets method to get frequent itemsets. The detailed steps of the method are described in [4].

3.3. Association rules generation   The generation of inter-transaction association rules is similar to the generation of classic association rules.

The calculation of rule confidence is shown in Definition 4.

3.4. Insightful association rules identification   This section introduces how to obtain the importance of an association rule that it has antecedent and consequent from different clusters.

Formally, let be a set of n distinct events and D be a set of spatial-temporal transactions over I. The spatial-temporal pattern that events in A belong to clusters  events in B to clusters  and  is  particularly interesting to us.

},...,,{ 21 neeeI =  BA? ;,...,, 21 isii CCC  ;,...,, 21 jtjj CCC  {}},...,,{},...,,{ 2121 =? jtjjisii CCCCCC  In order to measure the importance of this kind rule, one can examine the impact of antecedent and consequent in their clusters, respectively. The concept is if a rule is insightful or important, then its antecedent  and consequent will be very similar or very close to their clusters, respectively, and the distance of the two contrasting sets of clusters needs to be far enough.

Similarity is used to measure the closeness between two contrasting sets of objects in a database D, whereas entropy is used for measuring the distance between two contrasting sets of clusters in D. Next, the two strategies to measure the importance of the discovered association rules are presented.

3.4.1. Joint-entropy. Fig. 3 shows the structure of the association rules that have antecedent and consequent from different clusters.

In Fig. 3, C1 and C2 are two clusters; eA belongs to C1 and eB belongs to C2.  is the discovered rule. Closeness is defined as:  BA ee ?  ? =  ?= n  j jAjAA eepeepCeC  111 ),,(log),()|(  (2)  where , ),(  ),( ),(    ? =  = n  k kA  jA jA  eeSimi  eeSimi eep  and  denotes the similarity between e),( 1 ja eeSimi A and e1j.

Next,  can be defined in the same way. )|( 2CeC B A rule is insightful if it satisfies the  following conditions: BA ee ?  (1)  where minsimi_1 denotes a minimum similarity threshold.

is the discovered rule. All the elements in X are neighbors to z  21 zz ? 1 and all the elements in Y are  neighbors to z2. We define the mutual information as the sum of the information amount of X  given Y, which is the same as that Y given X.

Experiments   The experimental salinity/temperature data used in this study were taken from the Argo delayed-mode database that can be downloaded from Oceanographically Products in Japan. The monthly salinity/temperature images are collected from the period January 2001 to December 2006. Concentric circles were put on each map and then all the events that occurred inside the concentric circles on each map were treated as a transaction. The radii for inner and outer circles were 900 km and 1800 km, respectively.

Concentric circles allow the events? location context information such as direction and distance to the reference site of Taipei, Taiwan, to easily be extracted.

In case no special events occurred in a sub-area then it is classified as a NOR event. After the quantitative attributes in Table 2 are mapped to several intervals, the PrefixSpan based algorithm is employed to find large inter-itemsets (the maxspan window size is set to 6 months and the minimum support is set to 25%).

Then the inter-transaction association rules can be derived from large itemsets as the minimum confidence is set to 70%. Table 3 shows part of the discovered association rules.

To check the importance of these rules, all the events are first grouped into clusters. This is illustrated by one example that addresses unusual patterns during the autumn and winter.

In autumn-winter time, the Kuroshio Branch Water (KBW) should flow from Luzon Strait to the South China Sea. To check the concentric circles on the salinity/temperature map, the salinity/temperature variations should be that the areas near J or K would affect the areas around H or G. In this case, if the salinity/temperature rule includes patterns such as H or G affecting J or K, it may be an unusual rule.

The following two rules were found during the experiment:  Rule 1. If salinity raises little in H1 then salinity will raise little in A2 three months later.

Rule 2. If salinity raises little in I1 then salinity will raise little in A2 three months later.

Which one is more important? First, the events that occurred during the autumn-winter time at sub-zone H are grouped into one cluster, and the events that occurred three month later at sub-zone A are grouped into another cluster. The same clustering approach can be applied to rule 2.

Setting the thresholds minsimi_1 equal to 0.6, minentro equal to 3, minsimi_2 equal to 0.6 and mininfo equal to ?3, it was found that rule 1 is more insightful.

5. Conclusion   This paper is based around two research objectives.

First, a strategy for discovering salinity/temperature patterns is proposed that can reveal their variations at different times and in different places. Secondly, in order to identify which rule is insightful, two entropy- based measurements to evaluate the discovered rules that have antecedent and consequent from different clusters were proposed. This rule?s importance information can offer experts a better basis for making decisions. For example, since the discovered rules contain salinity/temperature variations that are related to their temporal and spatial attributes, the insightful rules can be used to build a fuzzy inference model.

This will allow the inference model to accurately predict when, where and what events will occur.
