Predicting Annotated HIV-1?Human PPIs using a Biclustering Approach to Association Rule Mining

Abstract?Discovering novel interactions between HIV-1 and human proteins would greatly contribute to the areas of HIV research. Identification of such interactions leads to a greater insight into drug target prediction. Here we have proposed an association rule mining technique based on biclustering for identifying a set of rules among the human proteins as well as HIV-1 proteins and using those rules some novel interactions are predicted. For prediction both the interaction types and direction of regulation of the interactions, are considered to provide accessible insight into HIV-1 infection. We have studied the biclusters and analyzed the significant GO terms and pathways where the human proteins of the biclusters participate. The predicted rules are further analyzed to discover regulatory relationships between some human proteins in course of HIV-1 infection. Some experimental evidences are collected from recent literature for validating the predicted interactions.



I. INTRODUCTION Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) in acquired im-  munodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) relies on human host cell proteins in virtually every aspect of its life cycle. The compu- tational approaches for predicting protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between different organisms (?inter-species predic- tion?), more specifically in virus and the corresponding host proteins are now very important. This helps in development of new therapeutic approaches and design of drugs for these viral diseases. Recently some computational approaches are proposed to predict and analyze some novel interactions be- tween HIV-1 and human proteins.

In [1] a random forest classifier integrated with a semi- supervised approach is used for selecting positive interactions in predicting new HIV-1-human PPIs. A structural similarity based approach for predicting HIV-1-human PPIs is proposed in [2]. Recently a biclustering [3] (a clustering [4] technique that is performed on both dimension of the dataset) technique is used to identify significant host-cellular subsystem in [5].

A similar biclustering approach is studied in [6] to find immunodeficiency gateway proteins and their involvement in microRNA regulation. In another study [7], an association rule mining approach is proposed for finding a set of association rules from PPI data and these rules are used for predicting new interactions. In both the studies [6], [7], the interaction types and regulation direction are not considered in finding the bicliques.

With this observation we use an association rule mining approach for finding a set of rules considering both the  interaction types and the direction of regulations. We use Bi- nary inclusion-Maximal (BiMax) biclustering algorithm [8] for identifying maximal biclusters from the input binary matrix.



II. METHODS  In this section we describe the proposed approach.

A. Preparation of the HIV-1-human PPI Bipartite Network  The HIV-1-human PPI dataset published in [9] consists of total 5127 interactions between 19 HIV-1 proteins and 1432 human proteins. For each interaction there is an associated interaction type. We broadly divide all the interaction types in three classes: regulating (direction is from viral to host proteins), undirected (no direction) and regulated by (direction is from host to viral proteins). For example ?activate? belongs to class 1 (regulating), ?downregulated by? is in class 3 (reg- ulated by), whereas ?requires/associates with? is regarded as undirected interaction type. Here we find 69 unique interaction types (among them 34 are in class 1, 26 are in class 2 and the remaining 9 are in class 3). We filter out the interactions by annotating each human protein with its corresponding interaction type considering the two classes (regulating and undirected) of interactions and get 2564 annotated human proteins. Here we consider only forward direction (from viral to host) and undirected regulations as these are important for getting valuable information about the regulation mechanism of human proteins. We construct a binary matrix of human and viral proteins, of size 2564 ? 19 in which an entry of ?1? denotes the presence of ?regulating? interaction between the corresponding pair of human and HIV-1 proteins, and an entry of ?0? represents the absence of any information regarding the interaction of the corresponding human and viral proteins. An entry ?X? represents the presence of an ?undirected? interaction between the corresponding pair of human and HIV-1 proteins.

B. Finding Association Rules  In data mining, association rule mining (ARM) is a pop- ular and well researched method for discovering interest- ing relations between variables and showing attribute-value associations that occur frequently in large databases. The problem of association rule mining is defined as follows: Let I = {i1, i2, . . . in} be a set of n items and X be an itemset where X ? I . Let T = {(t1, X1), (t2, X2), . . . (tm, Xm)} be a      set of m transactions, where ti and Xi, i = 1, 2, . . . ,m are the transaction identifier and the associated itemset respectively.

The support of an itemset X is the number of transactions where all the items in X appear. An itemset is called frequent if its support is greater than some threshold min sup. The confidence of an Association Rule (AR) of the form P ? Q, P ? Q = ?, P  ? Q = X obtained from an itemset X is  defined as the ratio of the support of X to the support of P . Formally the ARM problem can be defined as follows: find the set of all rules R of the form P ? Q such that P ? Q is a frequent itemset and the confidence of P ? Q is  greater than a threshold min conf . The concept of frequent closed itemset [10], which is a condensed representation of all frequent itemsets, is defined to avoid redundancy. An itemset is called closed itemset if none of its proper supersets have the same support value. Finding the set of frequent itemsets is equivalent to find a set of all-1 biclusters each having at least min sup number of rows [7]. BiMax generates all maximal biclusters and as the columns of maximal biclusters represent a closed itemset, so all extracted biclusters satisfying min sup condition provide the set of frequent closed itemsets.

Here the rows of the binary matrix represent the viral pro- teins and the columns represent the annotated human proteins.

Each row (viral protein) has been considered as a transaction and each column (human protein) represents an item. An item is purchased by a transaction if the corresponding value in the matrix is ?1? or ?X? and is interpreted as follows: with a viral protein some of the human proteins are associated with specific type of interaction. Here a maximal all-1 bicluster with a given min sup value is equivalent to a frequent closed itemset. BiMax algorithm is utilized for finding the maximal biclusters and these biclusters are treated as maximal frequent closed itemset for finding the association rules.

Here the rules may be of type:  [HP1 upregulates,HP2 activates]  ? [{HP3,HP4} activates,HP5 downregulates]  This may be interpreted as follows: if the human protein HP1 is upregulated, HP2 is activated by some set of viral proteins then there is a high chance of activation of the two proteins HP3 and HP4 and downregulation of the protein HP5 by the same set of viral proteins.

C. Predicting New Interactions  From the extracted association rules we predict some novel interactions associated with interaction types, between HIV-1 and human proteins. Consider a frequent closed itemset consists of annotated human proteins as follows: HP1 f1, . . . ,HP5 f5, where each fi denotes the interaction type tagged with each of these human protein. Suppose a rule constructed from those proteins is as follows:  [HP1 f1, HP2 f2,HP3 f3] ? [HP4 f4,HP5 f5]  In this scenario we further assume that the proteins HP1 f1, . . . , HP5 f5 form a biclique with 3 viral proteins V 1, V 2, and V 3 (in other words we can say that the support count for  Fig. 1. An example of prediction process from the association rules.

this frequent itemset is 3) shown in Figure 1. Now without loss of generality suppose the proteins in the antecedent of the rule form another biclique with 4 viral proteins: V 1, V 2, V 3, and V 4. So the confidence of this rule is 3/4 or 75%. From this observation we can predict that viral protein V 4 is also likely to interact with HP4 f4 and HP5 f5 and confidence of this prediction is 75%. Figure 1 describes the whole scenario.



III. RESULTS  In this section we analyze the predicted biclusters or bicliques and study the biological relevance of the human proteins constituting those bicliques. After that we show the association rules that are generated from those biclusters. We also show some novel predicted interactions and find out the evidences from recent literature that strengthen our prediction.

A. Analysis of Obtained Bicliques and Predicted Rules  We find 17 biclusters keeping minimum number of viral proteins (or, min sup value) as 4 and minimum number of human proteins (or, minimum number of items) as 2 in our constructed binary matrix. These are shown in Table I.

Columns 4, 5 and 6 represent the most significant GO-terms, GO-id and the corresponding p-value of three broadly clas- sified GO categories: biological process, molecular function and cellular component respectively. We also find significant KEGG pathways for the human proteins participating in each bicluster. In Table I the first biclique consists of 12 human proteins that belong to the T cell receptor signaling pathway which plays a key role in human immune system. Human proteins in bicliques 3 and 4 also belong to the same signaling pathway. Human proteins in biclique 5 are affected by two glycoproteins GP120 and GP160, Transactivating protein (Tat) and accessory protein Vpr of HIV-1 virus that may lead to Colorectal cancer. The human proteins in biclique 6 interact with 4 HIV-1 proteins (2 envelop protein, Nef and Tat) and are involved in Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway. Human proteins in some bicliques are involved in Graft-versus-host disease in which a lethal complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is noticed where immunocompetent donor T cells attack the ge- netically disparate host cells. The proteins in bicliques 11, 14, 17 are involved in the pathway Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) which is caused by progressive, lethal, degenerative disorder of motor neurons. It is established that HIV causes diverse disorders of the brain, spinal cord and peripheral     TABLE I THE SIGNIFICANT GO TERMS AND ID AND KEGG PATHWAYS FOUND IN THE BICLIQUES  Biclique HIV protein Human protein GO term (bp) GO term (cc) GO term (mf) KEGG pathway 1 Tat Vpr env gp120 matrix BCL2 CASP3 TP53 IFNG IFNG IL10 IL2  IL6 MAPK1 NFKB1 PARP1 FOS JUN TNF  regulation of apoptosis (GO: 0042981) (3.1E-11)  nucleoplasm (GO:0005654) (6.8E-5)  promoter binding (GO:0010843) (1.7E-5)  T cell receptor signaling pathway (1.2E-9)  2 Nef Tat env gp120 env gp160 BCL2 ICAM1 IFNG IL1B IL2 IL6 MAPK1 MAPK3 FOS JUN  positive regulation of nitrogen compound metabolic process (GO: 0051173) (1.8E-8)  extracellular space (GO:0005615) (8.3E-4)  cytokine activity (GO:0005125) (2.6E-4)  Toll-like receptor signaling path- way (3.3E-7)  3 Nef Vpr env gp120 env gp160 CD4 BCL2 IFNG IL2 IL6 MAPK14 MAPK1 FOS JUN  positive regulation of macro- molecule metabolic process (GO:0010604) (2.5E-10)  nucleoplasm (GO:0005654) (1.4E-2)  protein dimerization activity (GO:0046983) (3.5E-3)  T cell receptor signaling pathway (2.2E-9)  4 Nef Tat Vpr env gp120 env gp160 BCL2 IFNG IL2 IL6 MAPK1 FOS JUN positive regulation of macro- molecule metabolic process (GO:0010604) ( 6.4E-8)  extracellular space (GO:0005615) (3.7E-2)  cytokine activity (GO:0005125) (3.2E-3)  T cell receptor signaling pathway (2.8E-6)  5 Tat Vpr env gp120 env gp160 BCL2 CYCS IFNG IL2 IL6 MAPK1 FOS JUN  regulation of apoptosis ( GO:0042981) (2.9E-7)  protein phosphatase type 2A complex (GO:0000159) (1.1E-2)  cytokine activity (GO:0005125) (4.5E-3)  Colorectal cancer (2.3E-6)  6 Nef Tat env gp120 env gp41 CCL5 IFNG IL1B IL10 IL2 IL2RA IL6 TNF  leukocyte migration (GO:0050900) (2.3E-11)  extracellular space (GO:0005615) (1.6E-7)  cytokine activity (GO:0005125) (7.4E-11)  Cytokine-cytokine receptor inter- action (8.9E-10)  7 Nef Tat Vpr env gp120 env gp41 IFNG IL10 IL2 IL6 TNF regulation of immunoglobulin production (GO:0002637) (1.1E-11)  extracellular space (GO:0005615) (8.2E-6)  cytokine activity (GO:0005125) (4.9E-8)  Allograft rejection (1.3E-6)  8 Tat env gp120 env gp160 env gp41 IL1A IL1B IL2 IL6 LCK positive regulation of protein transport (GO:0051222) (4.6E-7)  extracellular space (GO:0005615) (5.9E-4)  cytokine activity (GO:0005125) (1.3E-5)  Graft-versus-host disease (1.7E-6)  9 Nef Tat env gp120 matrix CCL3 IFNG IL6 TNF positive regulation of protein amino acid phosphorylation (GO:0001934) (1.8E-9)  extracellular space (GO:0005615) (8.2E-6)  cytokine activity (GO:0005125) (4.9E-8)  Allograft rejection (1.3E-6)  10 Nef Tat Vpr env gp120 env gp41 ma- trix  IFNG IL6 TNF regulation of chemokine biosyn- thetic process ( GO:0045073) (4.9E-7)  extracellular space (GO:0005615) (2.9E-3)  cytokine activity (GO:0005125) (2.2E-4)  Graft-versus-host disease (5.7E-5)  11 Tat Vpr env gp120 retropepsin BCL2 CASP3 CYCS PARP1 B cell homeostasis (GO:0001782) (2.4E-3)  protein phosphatase type 2A complex (GO:0000159) (4.7E-3)  not found Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (3.2E-4)  12 Tat Vpr env gp120 matrix CCL3 IFNG IL6 TNF regulation of chemokine biosyn- thetic process ( GO:0045073) (1.5E-6)  extracellular space (GO:0005615) (1.5E-4)  cytokine activity (GO:0005125) (3.3E-6)  Cytokine-cytokine receptor inter- action ( 1.4E-4)  13 Nef env gp120 env gp160 env gp41 CD4 IL1B IL2 IL6 positive regulation of T cell acti- vation ( GO:0050870) (1.7E-7)  extracellular space (GO:0005615) (8.3E-3)  growth factor activity (GO:0008083) (4.5E-4)  Graft-versus-host disease (1.7E-4)  14 Nef Tat Vpr env gp120 retropepsin BCL2 CASP3 PARP1 B cell homeostasis (GO:0050870) (1.7E-7)  nuclear envelope ( GO:0005635) (3.2E-2)  transcription factor binding (GO:0008134) (7.7E-2)  Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (2.1E-2)  15 Nef Tat Vpr env gp120 env gp160 env gp41  IL2 IL6 positive regulation of immunoglobulin secretion (GO:0051024) (3.7E-4)  extracellular space (GO:0005615) (5.4E-2)  growth factor activity (GO:0008083) (1.2E-2)  Graft-versus-host disease (7.7E-3)  16 Nef Vpr Vpu env gp120 CD4 CASP3 NFKB1 regulation of T cell activation (GO:0050863) (1.7E-2)  intracellular organelle lumen (GO:0070013) (1.9E-2)  protein homodimerization activ- ity (GO:0042803) (5.1E-2)  Epithelial cell signaling in Heli- cobacter pylori infection (2.7E-2)  17 Tat Vpr env gp120 env gp160 retropepsin  BCL2 CYCS positive regulation of catalytic ac- tivity (GO:0043085) (3.8E-2)  protein phosphatase type 2A complex (GO:0000159) (1.6E-3 )  not foune Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (1.0E-2)  nerves and could be a risk factor for either amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) itself or other motor neuron diseases [11].

We predict a total of 46 rules from the biclusters and filter out those which have confidence level less than 80%.

Figure 2 shows the rules. All the rules are important for getting valuable information about the regulation mechanism of human proteins. A proper analysis of these rules reveals the interdependence of the regulation mechanism of a set of proteins constituting a rule.

B. Predicted Interactions  From the biclusters of the binary matrix we predict some highly confident interactions between HIV-1 and human pro- teins. We also analyze the biological relevance of those interac- tions and conduct a literature survey to establish experimental evidence supporting our predicted interactions. For finding the experimental evidences of our predicted interactions we extensively search PUBMED for finding some recent reports describing predicted interactions. Among the predicted 46 in- teractions between HIV-1 and human proteins, 26 interactions  are found to be experimentally validated and these are shown in Table II with corresponding PUBMED ids.

Here we predict 9 human proteins that interact with HIV-1 protein Tat with specific interaction types. In row 2 of Table II we predict the downregulation of human protein Interleukin 2 (IL2) by HIV-1 protein Tat. Tat induces IL2 secretion and this is due to Tat-enhanced IL-2 promoter activation. In [12] the cause of enhanced IL-2 secretion is investigated and it is found that the HIV Tat induces this effect. We also predict that Tat activates caspase-3 (CASP3) and caspase-9 (CASP9).

In [13] it has been found that Tat activated both caspase-3 and endonuclease-G, a caspase-independent effector of apoptosis.

We predict upregulation of human protein Interleukin 6 (IL6) by HIV-1 proteins Tat and Nef. Tat induced the production of human interleukin-6 (huIL-6) and its receptor (huIL-6Ra) and activated STAT3 signaling [13].

Our prediction also includes 10 human proteins that in- teract with (activates-5, downregulates-3, upregulates-2) HIV- 1 protein Nef. We are able to find PUBMED ids of some recent articles indexed in PUBMED that also agree with these     Fig. 2. Predicted rules generated from the biclusters  predicted interactions.

Our prediction also includes other HIV-1 proteins like Vpr,  matrix, Vpu, Envelop glycoprotein-120, and 160 that interact with some human proteins associated with specific interaction types. We noticed here that there are some human proteins associated with a specific interaction type to interact with more than one viral proteins. For example both viral protein Tat and Env gp120 are responsible for downregulation of CD4 protein.

BCL2 is also downregulated by Tat as well as Vpu.

IV. CONCLUSIONS  Here we presented the problem of identifying novel inter- actions between HIV-1 and human proteins as an association rule mining problem based on BiMax biclustering algorithm.

For predicting new interactions we consider the direction of regulation and the types of the interactions as reported in the HIV-1-human interaction database. For validating the predicted interactions some evidences from recent literature are collected to establish the fact that many of our predicted interactions already exist in reality. We also performed a gene ontology based study on the predicted bicliques and found some significant pathways. Considering the regulation direc- tion we predicted association rules at certain confidence levels and illustrated the general meaning of those types of rules.

In this article we do not consider the direction of regulation from host to viral proteins. Considering interaction types in this direction may produce a valuable response regarding the immune response of human proteins under certain HIV- 1 attack. We suggest this as a future work.
