Association Analysis of Ocean Salinity and Temperature Variations

Abstract  Ocean salinity and temperature variations have received increasing attention in recent years due to their relation to global climate changes such as warm winters, the universal drought, heat waves, floods and snowstorms. The factors that affect climate changes vary across the world. For example, Taiwan is subtropical where the climate is influenced by airstreams and ocean currents. In this study, association rule mining is used to discover interesting patterns from Argo ocean salinity and temperature data sampled in the waters surrounding Taiwan. The discovered rules may have the form: if the first month salinity rose from 0.15psu to 0.25psu in the A1 area and the second month temperature rose from 0  to 1.2  in B1 area, then the third month salinity will rise from 0.1psu to 0.2psu in the A2 area. A visualization interface is provided to display the association rules.

Simulation results from Argo data are presented to verify the applicability of the proposed system.

1. Introduction  Salinity and temperature data can be used to forecast global climate variations. In this paper, spatial and temporal salinity and temperature patterns in the ocean data are visualized.

As an alternative to statistical data analysis methods data mining allows for the automatic exaction and analysis of patterns of interest from large amounts  of data. Several data mining studies have demonstrated how to obtain spatial patterns or temporal patterns [3,5,7], and some of their methods are developed based on the Apriori algorithm. Apriori-like methods are capable of finding spatial-temporal patterns, but spatial data do not readily map into transactions which are the basic unit of Apriori method. Several methods, such as the one described in [3], have been proposed for transforming spatial data into transaction data, although context information is lost. Moreover, market basket transactions are independent of each other, but the spatial or temporal relationships may exist between the transactions in the spatial data.

Taking our ARGO database as an example, association mining may find rules such as: R1: when the temperature rose, then we forecast the salinity will rise.

This prediction rule is limited; as the following rule may be more useful: R2: If the temperature near northern Taiwan rose from 0  to 0.8 , then the salinity near northeast Taiwan will rise from 0psu to 0.15psu in the next month.

There are several fundamental differences between the above two rules. In particular, for the second rule, two associated events belonging to two transactions can be linked and the rule incorporates contextual information, such as time or locations that contributes to the validation of associations.

In this study ARGO data measured in the waters surrounding Taiwan were mined for interesting salinity or temperature patterns. The reference centric model is   DOI 10.1109/ICCIT.2008.37    DOI 10.1109/ICCIT.2008.37     employed for transforming ocean data into transactions while maintaining the location context information that describes where the transactions happened. Next, an inter-transaction association rules mining algorithm is applied to the transformed Argo data to discover salinity and temperature patterns that are associated with their spatial and temporal variation. In [1] a sliding window is applied to the transaction database to construct a smaller number of inter-items set before subsequent mining such that the computational complexity is reduced.

The remaining parts of this paper are organized as follows. In section 2 the problems at hand are summarized and related work is introduced. Section 3 presents the proposed algorithm and our system is described. Section 4 provides experimental evidence.

We will give a brief conclus1ion in section 5.

2. Problem Definition  This section describes the problems of mining spatial-temporal patterns.

2.1. Inter-transaction Association Rules Mining This part introduces the problem as well as  fundamental definitions [1, 5, 7].

Definition 1. Let = {e1, e2, ?, ei} be a set of items.

Let  be an attribute and Dom( ) be the domain of  . A transaction database is a database containing transactions in the form of (d, E), where d ? Dom( ) and E ? .

The dimensional attribute is used to describe the properties associated with the items, such as time and location. It is assumed that the domain of the dimensional attribute is ordinal and can be divided into equal length intervals. In order to avoid spending unnecessary computational resources mining rules which users are not interested in, a maximum span threshold, ?maxspan (or sliding_window_size)?, denoted by w, is introduced. When mining inter- transaction association rules, only the rules which span less than or equal to w intervals will be mined. Users can thus use a maxspan window to avoid mining rules that span across wide intervals.

Definition 2. W is a sliding window with w intervals and j is the number of items in . We define an inter- transaction F that is contained within W to be:  F = {ei(k) | ei ? W[k]; 1 ? i ? j; 0 ? k ? w ? 1}.

To distinguish the items in an inter-transaction from the items in a traditional transaction, the items in an inter-transaction are called extended-items. We  denote the set of all possible inter-items as ?. Given and t, we will have  I? = {e1(0),?,e1(t-1), e2(0), ?, e2(t-1), ?, ej(0), ?, ej(t-1)}.

Definition 3. An inter-transaction association rule has the form X ? Y, where  (1) X ? ?, Y ? ?.

(2) ?ej(0) ? X, 1 ? j ? i.

(3) ?ejk(u) ? Y, 1 ? j? i, u ? 0.

(4) X 	 Y =?.

Definition 4. Let S be the number of transactions in the transaction database. Let Txy be the set of inter- transactions that contains a set of inter-items X Y and Tx be the set of inter-transactions that contains X.

Then, the support and confidence of an inter- transaction association rule X ? Y are defined as:  | | .xy  T support  S ? .

xy  x  T confidence  T ?            (1)  2.2. Spatial Patterns Mining Spatial data mining [5-9] is used to discover  interesting implicit knowledge in spatial databases.

This is an important part when trying to understand spatial data and using knowledge bases. A spatial association rule is a rule indicating certain association relationship among a set of spatial and possibly some non-spatial predicates. The extraction and comprehension of the knowledge implied by the huge amount of spatial data though highly desirable pose great challenges to currently available spatial database technologies.

The spatial transactions need to be defined before mining the data. After inter-transactions are defined by applying the sliding windows, we can find association among transactions within the maxspan window that corresponds to discovery associations between items that are in the same maxspan window. Hence, an alternative is to treat each event as a transaction and find connection between these transactions.

3. Mining Spatial-Temporal Patterns from Argo Data  3.1. Argo Data Argo is a broad-scale global array of 3,000 free-  drifting profiling floats that measures the temperature and salinity of the upper 2000m of the ocean. This allows continuous monitoring of the temperature, salinity, and velocity of the upper ocean. All data are relayed and made publicly available within a few hours of collection.

Argo has already grown to be a major component of the ocean monitoring systems. Argo data provide a qua  re anomalies.

s The work aims at finding the ocean salinity and  waters surrounding Taiwan.

It is used for initializing ocean and coupled ocean-atmosphere forecast models, for data assimilation and for model testing.

Taiwan is chosen as the reference object and the concentric circles placed on Taiwan are used to define the neighboring region of the reference object. A transaction is materialized by the reference centric model to enumerate the abnormal events inside the concentric circles. The concentric circles also help us get the location information for those abnormal events.

3.3. Mining Spatial-T  main steps: Data preprocessing Since bo  variations are quantitative e mapped onto several disjoint intervals such as the  ones shown in Table 2. After the quantitative attributes are mapped to intervals, the mining problem can be transformed into one of the following binary data as the ones shown in Table 3.

FITI quent intra-transaction itemsets and then transforms  the original database to encode frequent itemset tables, (called FIT tables). The discovery of frequent inter- transaction itemsets employs the Apriori algorithm to perform the level-wise mining that uses the FIT tables as input. Since the frequent inter-transaction itemsets are discovered from the frequent intra-transaction itemset tables rather than the original database, the FITI algorithm performs better than the Apriori  algorithm or even the extended hash Apriori algorithm [1].

(3) T ru  The inter-transaction association rules can be found using th  erating the inter-transaction association rules is similar to the method used for generating traditional association rules. Table 4 shows the inter-transaction rule mining results.

4. Experimental Results and Analysis  The experimental salinity and temperature data were downloaded from the Ocean graphical products in Japan and comprised the Argo delayed-mode database. The collected monthly salinity and temperature images belong to the period starting from 2001/01 to 2006/12. In order to simplify the experiment, we restrict the mining space around Taiwan.

4.1. Forecasting Imagine the rule ?A1SSDL(3)&B2SNOR(0)  A1SSDL(4)  (support is 35.4%, confidence is 81.0%)? at a depth of 2000 meters, which means that ?if nothing happens during the first month (May 2007) in B2 and the fourth month (August 2007) salinity drops little from -0.15psu to 0psu in A1, then the fifth month (September 2007) salinity will drop little from - 0.15psu to 0psu in A1.? Then we can successfully find the events that will occur in September from May and August of 2007.

4.2. Different Depths Argo data were probed at depths of 100, 400, 1000  and 2000 meters below sea level. We collected Argo salinity and temperature data comprising each month from 2001 to 2006. For example with Argo data at depth 2000 meters collected each month from 2001 to 2006 will comprise 72 transactions. After applying the Apriori algorithm that uses thresholds of support of 18% and confidence of 80% to find large items there generate 249 items. In this example we set the span  value of sliding windows to six and the maximum length of large items is 14.

(1) Depth 100 meters The experiment is explained as follows and shown  in Table 5. If the sliding window is two the file size will be 108KB. After applying the FITI algorithm some rules can be removed such that the file size is reduced to 4KB. Next, a check is performed to see if the subset of max size is three.

If the sliding window is three the file size will be 620KB. After applying the FITI algorithm some rules can be removed such that the file size is reduced to 22KB. Then, a check is performed to see if the subset of max size is four.

If the sliding window is six the file size will be 10.9MB. After applying the FITI algorithm the file size is reduced to 213KB. Then, a check is performed to see if the subset of max size is seven.

The file representing a depth 400 meter is larger than the file of representing data at a depth of 100 meters. By inspecting primitive Argo data we find out the file of depth 400 having more event of TNOR or SNOR. Fig. 1 displays that many locations did not have anything happened.

(2) Depth 400 meters  The experiment is explained as follows and shown in Table 6. If the sliding window is two a file size of 1.79GB is created. After applying the FITI algorithm the file size is reduced to 759MB. Because of the large file size, the computer was only able to check subset of max size to 7-large item.

If the sliding window is three the file size will be 1.46GB which is reduced to 326MB with the FITI algorithm. Again, because of the large file, it is only possible to check the subset of max size to 5-large item.

If the sliding window is six the file size will be 7.77GB. After applying the FITI algorithm the file size is reduced to 857MB. Again because of the large size, the computer can only check subset of max size to 4- large item.

(3) Depth 1000 meters  The experiment is explained as follows. If the sliding window is two the file size will be 335MB which is reduced to 191MB with the FITI algorithm. In the end we check subset of max length of large itemset is fourteen.

If the sliding window is three due to the huge file, the computer only can check subset of max size to 6- large item. We cannot get more than subset of 6-large item. The file size will be 4.49GB which is reduced to 1.61GB with the FITI algorithm.

If the sliding window is six the computer only can check subset of max size to 4-large item. We cannot get more than subset of 4-large item. The file size will     be 3GB which is reduced to 549MB with the FITI algorithm.

(4) Depth 2000 meters  The experiment is explained as follows and shown in Table 7. If the sliding window is two the file size will be 0.98MB which is reduced to 354KB with the FITI algorithm. In the end we check subset of max length of large itemset is eight.

If the sliding window is three the file size will be 5.44MB which is reduced to 1.38MB with the FITI algorithm. In the end we check subset of max length of large itemset is eight.

If the sliding window is six the file size will be 116MB which is reduced to 14MB with the FITI algorithm. In the end we check subset of max length of large itemset is fourteen.

4.3. Implementation After generating inter-transaction association rules  from depth 100 to 2000, the forecast of the ocean salinity and temperature are visualized. User can choose conditions such as ocean depth, area, ocean salinity or temperature events.

For example, if the user selects a depth of 1000 meters, the area is A1 and the event is salinity as shown in Fig. 2, then the system will mine accordingly with above conditions to extract the inter-transaction association rules as shown in Fig. 3. In the end, the users can choose one of them to show explanation of correlation diagram in Fig. 4. Besides, we can derive some commonly occurred inter-transaction association rules at different depths. Table 8 lists part of the rules and their corresponding support and confidence values.

5. Conclusions  This study utilizes an inter-transaction rules mining framework on ocean science data to find salinity and temperature patterns. The inter-transaction rules provide   valuable information for decision purposes.

The mining work starts by identifying interesting or abnormal events in salinity and temperature images.

The discovered spatial-temporal rules that have events in antecedent and consequent parts from different spatial clusters will be more interesting than those from the same spatial cluster. We designed a visualization website which helps users better understand inter-transaction rules of ocean salinity and temperature relationships. Hence, the analysis of abnormal ocean salinity and temperature events are no longer limited to the experts.
