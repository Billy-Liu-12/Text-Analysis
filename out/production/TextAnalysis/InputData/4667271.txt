Mismatching Judgment Using PDAF in ICCP Algorithm

Abstract   B. Kamgar-Parsi applies iterative closest contour point (ICCP) algorithm into underwater gravity matching, in which simplex algorithm is used to estimate the optimal trace of vehicle. However, simplex algorithm is usually convergent to the local optimization so that there is mismatching or even diverging. In this paper, the rule of mismatching judgment for ICCP is established to reduce mismatching probability. At present, the well used mismatching judgment rule, M/N method, has several shortcomings, including matching several times before location, much large matching error, and difficult to decide parameters. In this paper, the rule of mismatching judgment for ICCP is established by probability data association filter (PDAF). Simulation shows that PDAF improves the convergence and precision compared with the ICCP algorithm without mismatching judgment, and its mismatching probability decreases 35 percent compared with M/N method. The PDAF method for mismatching judgment increases the ICCP?s precision and stabilization.

1. Introduction   B. Kamgar-Parsi [1] applies the ICCP algorithm into underwater gravity matching. ICCP algorithm is a method of optimization between inertial navigation system (INS) position and the elevation that vehicle is passing by. The key to the algorithm is the way to realize quick and global convergence. For a given environment (INS precision, elevation measurement precision, cartography error and terrain features), different parameters can affect the real time and precision of the convergence in the optimal process. Monte-Carlo method can be used in simulation to analyze mismatching, but can?t be used in actual flight for its time-consuming and huge calculation. In practice, M/N method is usually applied to judge mismatching effectively, but it has to match several times before location which may due to precision decreasing and N, M  and acceptable threshold is also difficult to decide.

Another approach is using geometry such as fitted curve, line or INS trace to judge mismatching with maximum probability [2].

The way to reduce ICCP mismatching is focused on.

The key problems include the method to choose the low bound of the target value and to establish the rule of mismatching judgment by PDAF. Simulation results prove that the mismatching judgment by PDAF has high accuracy and robustness. The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we introduce the principle of ICCP algorithm briefly. In section 3, the low bound of target value is discussed by analytical and experimental solutions. In section 4, how to avoiding mismatching is solved by PDAF. In section 5, the simulation results are given. In section 6, the application of mismatching judgment is concluded.

2. The basic principle of ICCP algorithm   Figure 1 shows the basic principle of ICCP algorithm.

Vehicle has an actual trace shown in the bold solid line, which consists of ( )' 1, 2, ,iP i W= , and W is the length of match points. INS gives an INS trace shown in the thin solid line consist of ( )1, 2, ,iP i W= .

Additionally, altimeter measures the local elevation ci, and each elevation is corresponding to a contour in Figure 1. More details can be found in [1][3].

Equation (1) can be rewrite as Equation (2).

( ) 22 2 1 1  W W  i i i i i i  E K? ? = =  = + + ?? ? x y ,            (2)  in which i? and i?  are velocity and course error  respectively; 1i i i i? ??= ?a a .

Choose the initial value ( )0 0 0 0 0?= + +x a b e , and b0 and e0 are the unit vectors along latitude and longitude.

Simplex algorithm is used in the optimization and it is free to calculate the gradients of target function. It uses E as matching judgment along with i?  and i?  as variables.

The bound of i?  and i?  generated randomly relies on the precision of INS. K is a coefficient which is related to the precision of INS, elevation measurement and terrain features. When the precision of INS is higher, K should be smaller, and verse vise.

It is assumed that the INS trace is near the actual trace.

If INS error is much large, terrain contour matching (TERCOM) can be used to obtain coarse matching firstly [3], or several traces near the INS trace will be generated so that it may be convergent to the global optimization [4].

3. The low bound of the target value   Generally, E should be minimal at the actual position, but it may converge to local optimization, a wrong matching position. Therefore, it is valuable to recognize the local or global optimization from the target value E directly. The mean of degree of slope, signal noise ratio and entropy in a map are known, and the INS and elevation measurement errors can also be modeled for a given vehicle. Therefore, a reasonable low bound Emin can be decided for ICCP.

We present a new approach to the global optimization which is choosing several groups of i?  and i?  and executing ICCP optimization several times instead of once. We can choose the most possible optimization as the matching position and refuse others as mismatching.

The way to judge the optimization will be discussed in section 4. The low bound of the target value E is important for the judgment because it decides the probability of matching and the threshold to terminate the iteration.

Divide Equation (1) or (2) into two parts: INS error and elevation error. It is shown in Equation (3) and (4).

INS HE E E= +  ,                           (3)  ( )2 2INS    W  i i i  W  H i i i  E  E K  ? ? =  =  = +  = ?  ? ?? ? ? ??  ?  ? x y ,                     (4)  in which INSE  is the error between the INS trace and the estimated trace. The estimated trace is assumed to be near the actual trace so that INSE  stands the INS drift and could be predicted easily. EH is the error between the estimated point and the closest points in contour and mainly depends on the elevation measurement error. The expectations of elevation error and degree of slope are  ( )E H?  and ( )E ?  respectively. The expectation of EH can be given as follows (?  is degree of slope).

( ) ( )  ( )H E H  E E K W E ?  ? = i i                     (5)  Equation (5) shows that target value (except EINS) is positive correlation with elevation measurement error but negative with degree of slope. Therefore, the algorithm is applicable in a map with large degree of slope and small elevation measurement error. According to Equation (5), the low bound is mainly determined by map feature.

4. Mismatching judgment by PDAF   Firstly, i?  and i?  are generated randomly Q times and added to the INS trace as the initial traces. Then, the simplex algorithm is run iteratively to find the minimum target value until E is less than the low bound Emin or the iterative times exceed the upper limit Tmax. E is regarded as the indicator of the optimization for this time (Q times totally). Usually, all the optimizations can be convergent although some are at the global optimizations and some at the local. Maybe the smallest E indicates that it is convergent at the actual position [4], but mismatching will appear if E at the actual position is not the smallest one for errors. Mismatching judgment by PDAF makes decision according to several times of matches thoroughly so that it not only judges matching results acceptable or not but also gives the credible probability.

If the global convergence is so good that all Q times of E may be small and convergent in the vicinity of the actual position, the credible probability should be high.

Otherwise, there will be larger or smaller E. The larger E should have a less credible probability while the smaller E should have a larger one. However, the sum of the     credible probability should be one forever. The first credible probability is shown in Equation (6).

i  i Q  i i  E  E  ?  =  =  ? ,                                 (6)  in which ( )1, 2, ...,i i Q? =  is the credible probability in the i-th optimization.

The last point of each W points (each optimization) is chosen as the optimal position. The optimal position with the largest credible probability is decided as the final matching position. The previous credible probability of optimal position is labeled as ' , ' 1, 2, ...,'j j Q? = , and the current credible probability as , 1, 2,...,i i Q? = . The two sets of optimal position with the corresponding INS position are shown in Figure 2 (Q=6).

Sketch of position distributing after two sets of optimal position combined with the corresponding INS position (?*? stands for previous set, and ?o? stands for current one) It is assumed that each position may be deduced from  any of the previous set and the INS error follows the normal distribution of ( )20,N ? . Therefore, the relationship between the 'j -th previous position and the i -th current position can be described by the conditional probability density as Equation (7).

The contour of a map is shown in Figure 4, where the across line is the planned trace from west to east. The elevation beneath the trace is shown in Figure 5, which is proper to TAN for its large fluctuation. It is assumed that the estimated trace is not far from the actual. The relationship between target value HE  and the reciprocal of the degree of slope is shown in Figure 6, which shows they correlate with each other strongly. In the area where degree of slope is larger, HE  would be smaller so that mismatching would be reduced.

The simulation consists of two parts: finding low bound of the target value and judging mismatching.

The maximum of EH is less than 0.005? with 10 points. EH=0.0005? for each point and EINS=0.0001? for each one. By Equation (3), Emin=(0.0005 + 0.0001)?W. The low bound can be decided adaptively by application conditions. The fixed bound is used in the simulation because the map used is small. To improve simulation speed, W=3; Emin=0.002; maxT =60; 1K = and Q=20;.

Simulation experiments are performed 50 times for ICCP with each mismatching judgment (None, M/N and PDAF). The results are compared in Figure 7. The left is all the 50 times of matching error samples, and the right is the mean of match error.

The M, N and the acceptable threshold is decided experimentally. If the acceptable threshold is too small the M/N method is inefficient or even unworkable because some times of matching are rejected, but if the threshold is too large there will be more mismatching because some times of mismatching are accepted.

The matching probability is computed from the fourth  matching (M/N method gives the location from the fourth match), and the matches whose error is larger than 0.002? is regarded as mismatching. Table 3 shows the result.

Conclusions   Based on ICCP and simplex optimization, the rule of mismatching judgment by PDAF are put forward and simulated. The simulation shows as follows.

(1) ICCP is too easy to diverge to be used in practice; (2) Compared with ICCP without mismatching  judgment, M/N method is convergent and reduces divergence effectively, but N, M and acceptable threshold are difficult to be designed. Moreover, its matching process is not stable too;  (3) Compared with the former two methods, PDAF method could improve ICCP matching precision remarkably. Its matching process is convergent and stable.

Its matching error is less than M/N method?s 35% approximately.
