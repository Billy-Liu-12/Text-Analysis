Abstract-Association rule is an important technology in Data mining. In library lending services, it can be used to analyze and add up the library loan services and information, and can scientifically carry out proposed borrow and recommended books to improve the efficiency of library management. By case analysis, it shows that the apriori algorithm in the association rule can effectively tap the hidden behind the valuable information in the data, and provide decision support for the library services and help libraries to carry out personalized information services.

I.  INTRODUCTION In modern society, the environment in which the library  has undergone tremendous changes, which requires the information more and more personalized and the library mode to be gradually changed from the past " collection center" to "user center ". [1] The library book- lending service is one of the most basic and important content in the traditional readers? services. Through the statistical analysis of the literature- lending, it will be useful for understanding the needs of readers to the literature and grasping the borrowing tendency of readers, and it is the premise on carrying out the in-depth work in the library services. Currently, the vast majority of library has adopted the book management system. The system will produce large amounts of data every day, but these data are usually used only for general traffic statistics lacking of integration and analysis. Therefore, people are eager to have a technology which can provide us with automatic and intelligent search, and the data mining just meets the requirements in this regard. In the five functions of the data mining, the association rule analysis can be a good method to unearth a lot of data and discover rules and characteristics of readers, to provide guidance for carrying out the library service. [2]

II. ASSOCIATION RULES MININING  A. Data Mining The term data mining was first appeared in the 11th joint  meeting on Artificial Intelligence in August 1989 in Detroit. It was also known as knowledge discovery in databases. Data mining is the extraction of implicit, in which, people do not know in advance, but is potentially useful information and knowledge in the process from a large number of incomplete, noisy, fuzzy, and random data. [3] Data mining is the most  powerful data analysis tool in the data warehouse, and it is also a useful application in the field of database research. It integrates the databases, artificial intelligence, machine learning, statistics and other fields of theory and technology.

And the data mining techniques include decision trees, neural networks, linear programming, Bayesian methods, association rule and other methods. Among these methods, the constant improvement of the association rule especially the apriori algorithm can provide a lot of convenience for people's daily lives.

B. The Association Rules in Data Mining The Association rule is a major form of the data mining  first proposed by Agrawal et al in 1993, an important research content in the field of the data mining , and it has always been widespread concerned in the database industry. The so-called association rule is to find the existing (potential) association of data items (attributes, variables) in the database. With the use of association rules of data mining, you can find the unknown dependencies among large amounts of data. [4]  With the large amount of data are collected and stored continuously in the database, the association rule of the data mining becomes more and more important. Finding interesting associations from a large number of historical records can help people make many business decisions, such as classification design, cross-shopping and so on. The "Shopping Basket Analysis" is a typical example of the association rule in the data mining. Through analyzing the associations of different goods put into the shopping basket by the customer at the same time, it can discover the customer?s buying patterns. The "Shopping basket analysis" can help managers make marketing strategies, and also enable managers to know what products are bought by customers frequently at the same time, which can re-layout the shelves of goods and the stock arrangements, or classify the users according to their buying patterns. For example, among the customers in the purchase of bread and butter, 90% of them also will buy the milk. The results of this analysis can help retailers? selective distribution and shelf arrangements, such as milk and bread can be put next to the butter as much as possible to guide sales.

C. The Concept of Association Analysis Let I = {i1, i2, i3 ..., im} as a set, the data items in the  transaction database D; T is transaction, the number of elements in the item set I, that is T <I; D is the transaction database, the set of all transactions of T.

Therefore, the association rule is the contain form as A ? B, in which A <I, B <I and A ? B = ?.[5]  The Association rule has two important measures, the minimum support (Support) and minimum reliability (Confidence). The degree of Support (AB) expresses the proportion of supporting A in the A ?  B in the entire transaction database; the credibility of Confidence (AB) expresses the proportion of supporting A in the A ? B. That is:  Support ((AB) = P (A ? B)) Confidence ((AB) = P (B | A))  In using the association mining techniques, it must first artificially set the threshold of the minimum support (Min- Support) and the minimum reliability (Min-Confidence). For example, setting lend Min-Support is 10% and Min- Confidence is 80% in the library lending information.  After mining all of the lending data in the database, we found the "threshold value" set by satisfying the above two types of books A and B.That is:  Support?A B??10% Confidence?A B??80%  Support (A B) ? 10% shows that in the borrowing records at least 10% of the people borrow two types books of A and B at the same time; Confidence (A B) ? 80% means that all A's loan book at least 80% of people will also borrow book B.

Therefore, by setting a reasonable minimum support and minimum reliability, and association mining large amounts of data will be closer to the information we need.

D. Association Rules Algorithm Currently, the mainstream of association rules algorithm  has Apriori algorithm, based on division algorithm, FP-tree frequent set algorithm, and the most classical algorithm is the Apriori algorithm proposed by Agrawal et al in 1993. The core of the Apriori algorithm is the recursive algorithm based on the two-stage of frequency. The calculation is as follows:  1) Scan the database D.

2) Form the candidate set C from kinds of sets of the  database D.

3) Add up the frequency of each data item in the  candidate set C in the number of times.

4) Exclude those data items which the statistical  frequency is less than the predetermined frequency of minimum support, the rest of the data items are formed the frequent item sets L.

5) Combine the data items of the frequent item sets L and form a new set of candidates C, repeat the third operation, until the data items in the L can not be combined again.

6) Calculate the confidence of the resulting frequent item sets of Lk.[6]  The flow chart of the Apriori algorithm shown in Figure1.



III. THE APPLICATION OF ASSOCIATION RULES OF DATA MINING IN BOOK-LENDING SERVICE  To further illustrate the application of association rules of data mining in book-lending service, the following original book-lending database which is from the social science book stacks in the university library the author works within a certain period of time is selected by the author. Based on the database, the association rules are used for the data mining.

The literature list of the social science book stacks is showed in Table I.

1) First, set the Min-Support = 10%, then the global scan of  the original database, generate candidate set C1 (see Table II).

2) By the Apriori algorithm, select the items which the support is greater than 10% of all entries set by the combination of these items into a set of frequent item sets L1 (see Table III).

TABLE III. THE FREQUENT SET L1   3) Repeat the two-step (1)and (2), generate the candidate set  C2 on the basis of the frequent set L1 .(see Table IV)and (see Table V).

TABLE IV. THE CANDIDATE SET C2  TABLE V. THE FREQUENT SET L2   4) Repeat these two steps, generate C3 and L3 on the basis of  C2, L2, (see Table VI, Table VII).

TABLE VI. THE CANDIDATE SET C3  TABLE VII. THE FREQUENT SET L3  Calculate the confidence level from the frequent set L3.

Confidence? BFH ? ?= ( )  ( )HSupport BFSupport ?42.9?  Confidence? HFK ? ?= ( ) ( )KSupport HFSupport ?58.3?  It can be seen, when readers borrow books in the social science book stacks, there are 42.9% of readers borrow the language, the text books may also borrow the philosophy, religion and economic class of books at the same time; 58.3% of the readers borrow the history and geography books at the same time may also borrow language, text, and economics books. Therefore, the library can put the history, geography, language, literature and economics books together, the readers can better facilitate the borrowing.

Readers will inevitably need to span multiple disciplines in the study or research, so it is very important to use the association rules in data mining to unearth and analyze the related data, and it is also necessary of this ability to enhance the library's information services. Practice shows that there exists a necessary connection in a variety of complex information in the book-lending database in the integrated library automation system. And there is some correlation among the borrowed books, also there is a certain degree of relevance between the readers and the books. For example, the people who are learning computer or working concerned with computer may be more concerned about the computer class books. In addition, under normal circumstances, the reader only searches  the location of a book when he search the book, and by association mining the book-lending records, we can analyze the collection books borrowed by different types readers.

When the reader borrows the book again, the system can automatically provide the reader with this book and other related books species on the basis of the results of excavation and thus guide the library services develop to the level of personalized information services.

Some experts predict that the application of association mining technology in the library is a key technology in the development of modern libraries. The use of the association mining techniques can not only analyze the book-lending data of readers, adjust the direction of the library collections and rationalize the system of the library's information resources; also find patterns of borrowing and lending of readers, and help the library to provide readers with personalized information service.

IV. CONCLUSION There are many methods of data mining, such as  classification method of decision tree, genetic algorithms, Bayesian methods, artificial neural network, set theory, cluster analysis, regression analysis and association analysis, and the association analysis is the most appropriate method of adding up and analyzing the book-lending information. But in the course of using this method, we should also pay attention to the following aspects:  1) Since the data mining is to find the rules from a large amount of data, data mining process it would take a lot of system resources in the data mining process, the data mining is usually carried out when the system is idle, or after exporting the data of the system.

2) The time of the data is determined by the size of the data, it must determine the appropriate size of the data to ensure the smooth progress of data processing. Too little data is difficult to explain the universality of the problem, the data is too large will reduce the efficiency of data processing.

3) The original data need data cleaning, data pretreatment and data conversion for achieving the data mining, and convert into the required data format. For example, the readers? information database in the library contains a lot of readers? information, if we want to identify the association rules among the readers? age, occupation, education and borrowing documents, we need to care about the readers? information of age, occupation, education, others may be regarded as unusful information, such as name, gender, etc. can be considered irrelevant information. Also, after the selection of the data clean-up. For example, there may be some vacancies in the field attribute value or the value of the noise inconsistencies.

Also, the selected data should be cleaned up. For example, there may be some vacancies in the field attribute value or the value of the noise inconsistencies.

4) The selection of the minimum support and the minimum confidence is set artificially on the basis of the data  situation and the needs of users. The minimum support expresses the minimum required to meet of the item sets in the statistical. The minimum confidence reflects the minimum required to meet the reliability of the association rules. If you set unreasonable, the final rule will be a lot or very little, in order to avoid this from happening, we should adjust the minimum support and minimum confidence timely in the course of data mining.

Thus, the selection of the above-mentioned minimum support and minimum confidence will affect the number of output rules and regulations related to the concept of layers of high and low. If you set too high, it may not find the rules, or find the rules you are not interested in; if you set too low, you may find many unimportant rules. Again, the weight calculation formula will also affect the degree of support for the item set. Therefore, how to select the minimum support, minimum confidence, the weight calculation function to generate truly efficient mining system and service system are follow-up questions to be studied improved by using parallel mining technology for processing book- lending information, and optimizing the level of library information services.
