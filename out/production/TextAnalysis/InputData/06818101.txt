I. INTRODUCTION The network fault diagnosis and location is the key point of  network management. When the networks fail to work, the operator must accurately find out the locations of the faults, the type of the faults and the faults causes in the shortest time as well as recovery in networks. Therefore, the rapid diagnosis has a significant meaning to the normal operation of the networks as well as improving the network stability.

The alarm correlation analysis is an important method of network fault diagnosis. It can eliminate redundant alarm information and warning storm, and find the root faults, as a result, diagnose and solve the problems. The alarm correlation analysis has many kinds of means, such as expert system, neural network, data mining etc. Among them, data mining attracts wide attention in recent years, mining association rules from original alarm data become the focus of research.

When a fault emerges, an alarm will be produced. And the related equipment or businesses may also fail to work and produce alarms. As a result, many redundant alarms are produced. So the relationship between the network alarms and faults is not accurate but fuzzy. Fussiness can provide a smooth transition between root alarms and non-root alarms, and can help to find more useful rules, so the fuzziness should be considered when alarm correlation analysis is carried out.

Besides, considering the need of management and operation, in this paper the network is divided into three layers, including the  business layer, the network layer and the physical layer. The network?s layered structure determines that faults have the characteristic of transmission. It means that the communication entity failures of the lower layer can spread into the other entity of upper layer. For example, when the line connection of the lower layer fails to work, it can affect multi-upper layers ?service delivery which depends on the line, and then multi-upper layers generate alarms. The alarms between layers have some relationship, which is helpful to locate the faults. So finding rules between layers is a meaningful direction.

Therefore, the multi-level fuzzy technology should be adopted in the alarm correlation analysis.

The Multi-level fuzzy association rules mining on the entire network is usually divided into two parts: mining the rules of one layer and that between layers. The proposed algorithms in this paper can mine both of them.

The first step of multi-level fuzzy association rules mining is the initialization of alarms, including establishing global alarm model of multi-layer network, doing the fuzziness of alarms and changing the fuzzy alarms database into fuzzy alarm transaction database. The second step is mining multi- level fuzzy association rules, which involves a very important issue about how to set minimum support. Distinguishing from the setting of minimum support, two new algorithms are proposed, one is called MFMA (Multi-Level Fuzzy Multiple Minimum Supports Mining Algorithm of Alarms) with multiple minimum supports and the other is called MFOA (Multi-Level Fuzzy One Minimum Supports Mining Algorithm of Alarms) with one minimum support. Simulations are carried out to the comparison of the two algorithms.



II. THE INITIALIZATION OF ALARMS There is lots of non-useful information to locate the faults  in original alarms and no accurate alarm model of multi-layers.

So we extract the useful information and establish global alarm model. Besides, in order to mine fuzzy association rules, the data source must be changed into fuzzy data, forming fuzzy alarms database.

The association rules are mined based on alarm transactions, so the fuzzy alarms database should be changed into fuzzy  The project is supported by National Nature Science Foundation of China (2011). The Foundation number is No.61171090.

transaction database. The alarms in the same time interval are expressed as one transaction. Every alarm emerged in the interval is one item of the transaction. The time interval is called time window, which slides across the database with a sliding step, the database will be changed into transaction database. This is the idea of sliding window.

Above all, series of initializations should be done; the details will be described below.

A. The Establishment of Multi-Layer Network Global Alarm Model An alarm message usually contains the following  information: Equipment ID (Alarm Node), Alarm Port, Alarm Level, Alarm Type and Alarm Time. So the alarms in all layers can be presented as five dimensional vectors (Node, Port, Level, Type, Time). Every dimension represents one attribute of alarms. After the fuzziness of alarms, we will add the sixth attribute called fuzziness as the last dimension of alarm.

The alarms may come from different layers, so there are two questions: how to determine which layer they come from and whether they are same or not. The model should settle the two questions.

The type attribute is used to distinguish the layers which alarms come from. In order to determine whether the two alarms are same or not, we should know how many alarm types that every layer has. So we assume that the business layer has four types, which are conversation business, stream business and interactive business and background business alarm types; the network layer has three types, which are error rate, time delay and link utilization alarm types; and there is one type in physical layer called equipment alarm type.

For the physical layer, because every alarm has its corresponding physical entity, so all five attributes are used to determine if the two alarms are same. But the front four attributes can entirely distinguish one alarm from another, and the last attribute just presents the time the alarm emerges, so if the front four attributes of two alarms are same, they are considered as one alarm, the type attribute is unified as 1.

Because the network layer is abstract layer, it can produce countable kinds of alarms, so we can just use Type attribute to determine whether two alarms are same, and the network layer?s three alarm types are numbered as 2, 3 and 4. The business layer is the same as the network layer, so the four alarm types in business layer are numbered as 5, 6, 7 and 8.

Then the global alarm model of multi-layer network has been established after the above process, every alarm consists of five attributes, and if the type attribute equals to 1, it is physical alarm; if the type attribute equals to 2,3,4, it is network alarm; if the type attribute equals to 5,6,7,8, it is business alarm. The model is shown in Fig. 1.

B. The Fuzziness of Alarms The fuzziness of alarms has two aspects which are the  determination of fuzzy sets and the fuzzy membership functions. According to the relationship between the alarms and the root alarms, the fuzzy sets are divided into five  linguistic terms, called VN (very near), N (near), MN (medium near), NN (not near) and FA (far away). The fuzzy membership functions are determined by algorithm PFKMA (Priori Fuzzy K-Means of Alarm Algorithm).

Physical layer  Network layer: three alarm types  Business layer: four alarm types  Node Port Level Type Time Fuzziness  Type  5,6,7,8  2,3,4    Figure 1. Global alarm model of multi-layer network  There is one key parameter in the algorithm PFKMA: U matrix. Every row vector of U matrix is fuzziness attribute value of an alarm. It is a five-dimensional vector; every dimension corresponds to the membership of alarm to one of five fuzzy sets. So the fuzziness attribute is five-dimensional vector such as (0.1, 0.89, 0.01, 0). 0.1 is membership of alarm to VN, 0.89 is membership of alarm to N and so on.

The alarms should be changed into a form which can illustrate approaching degrees of alarms to faults. The more approaching, the more important the alarm is. This form is called valued alarms. The changing process is described below.

Firstly, we use the route numbers of alarm nodes to indicate the status of alarms nodes in network. The greater the number is, the more important the alarms issued by the node should be.

Secondly, each port?s status in network is expressed by the port?s link number. The greater the number is, the more important the alarms generated by the port are. Then the alarm level is divided into four levels: serious alarms, important alarms, general alarms and suggestive warnings, expressed by 4, 3, 2, 1. After that we define eight alarm categories according to the part A of II, expressed by 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Finally, the alarm occurrences (counts) in the unit time (we take 30s in the paper) are used to illustrate the importance of alarms. When the process is completed, the original five-dimensional alarms are expressed as new five-dimensional vectors called valued alarms, which contain network node route, network port link, alarm level, alarm type, alarm density.

The PFKMA algorithm has the following process:  The Inputs are: Original alarms database, network topology connections database.

The Outputs are: fuzzy alarms database.

C. The Fuzzy Alarm Transaction Database We get the fuzzy alarms database following the above  algorithm. Then with the idea of sliding window illustrated above, the fuzzy alarms database is changed into the fuzzy alarm transaction database. The form of the fuzzy alarm transaction database is shown in table I.

III. THE SETTING OF MINIMUM SUPPORT During the process of mining multi-level fuzzy association  rules, there is a very important issue about how to set minimum support.

Reasonable minimum support setting has great significance on mining frequent items. If the minimum support is set too small, a lot of redundant frequent items will be found, if it is set too big, many useful frequent items will be lost. So a good setting method is very important.

There are two methods to set minimum support. The first is setting different minimum supports for different candidate item-sets. The faults in physical layer may cause faults in business and network layer, the faults in network layer may cause faults in business layer too. As a result, alarms generated by business layer are relatively more than the other layers and alarms generated by network layer are relatively more than physical layer. So the minimum supports of the business layer, the network layer and the physical layer are respectively set as MINSUP1, MINSUP2, MINSUP3 and satisfy MINSUP1 > MINSUP2> MINSUP3. Because every item in each candidate item-set must satisfy their corresponding layer?s minimum support and each candidate item-set?s occurrence frequency is less than or equal to that of its every item, therefore, the minimum supports of each candidate item-set are respectively set to the minimum support of the lower layer of its every item?s corresponding layers. The second is setting one minimum support for all candidate item-sets.



IV. MINING MULTI-LEVEL FUZZY ASSOCIATION RULES  A. MFMA The MFMA is a multi-level fuzzy association rules mining  algorithm and characteristic for multi-minimum supports which is the first minimum supports setting method discussed in III.

The program flow chart of the MFMA is shown in Fig. 2.

The Inputs has four aspects:  Original alarms database;  Network topology connections database;  Minimum support: MINSUP1, MINSUP2, MINSUP3 (satisfying MINSUP1>MINSUP2>MINSUP3);  Minimum confidence: MINCONF;  The Outputs are multi-level fuzzy association rules.

Candidate frequent 1-sets are composed by all the fuzzy alarms. The calculating methods of fuzzy supports of candidate frequent 1-sets are different for different layers.

For the business layer: if a candidate frequent 1-set is in different fuzzy alarms (such as h alarms), the fuzzy support of     the candidate frequent 1-set is the average of h fuzzy alarms ?s fuzzy supports, calculated according to (6):  ( ) r  n h j  ik i 1 1  Fsup business / network f hn = =  =??   (6)  The network layer is the same to the business layer; fuzzy support of the candidate frequent 1-set is calculated according to (6).

Program flow chart of MFMA  For the physical layer, the fuzzy support of the candidate frequent 1-set is calculated according to (7):  ( ) n  j j k ik  i 1  Fsup I f n =  =?  (7)  The fuzzy support calculating method of candidate frequent k-sets is illustrated below. Z is the set of fuzzy alarms,  { }1 2 1Z I I ..., k kI I += ? ? ? , the fuzzy support of Z in the database is shown in (8): ilf  means the membership of transaction i to fuzzy alarm l. 1, 2, 1l k= + ; 1, 2,i n= . r 1,2, lh= and for every l, lh  has the same meaning as h illustrated above.

(8)  If an association rule is R : X Y?  and { }1 2 k 1X Y x x ,..., x Z+= =? ? , then R?s confidence defines in (9):  f f fD D DFconf (X Y) Fsup (Z) Fsup (X)? =  (9)  B. MFOA The MFOA is another multi-level fuzzy association rules  mining algorithm. It uses the second setting strategy of minimum supports discussed in III, so it has only one minimum support. The basic process of the MFOA is same to the MFMA.

They have two differences:  1).The MFOA algorithm only sets one minimum support: MINSUP.

2). Because of 1), MFOA does not have to calculate every candidate item-set?s minimum support separately, but compare the fuzzy support of every candidate item-set to MINSUP directly.



V. PREFORMANCE STUDY All the experiments were performed on a 3.30GHz Core  2PC with 3.40GB of main memory, running under Windows XP professional. The algorithm is coded in C++ on Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 platform.

A. The Experiment Results In order to verify the correctness of the MFOA and the  MFMA, simulations are taken out in the background of the network in Fig. 3.

7 8                Figure 3.  Network  There are 21 nodes in the network, numbered from 1 to 21.

Notes 14, 15, 16, 19, 20 are central nodes and the rest are edge nodes. The connections of these nodes are shown in Fig. 3.

The alarm generation rules have the following assumptions:  ? The alarms are issued by central nodes.

? Every transmission step of alarms, alarm level cuts 1s, alarm time increases 1s.

?The alarms do not return, if the initial alarm level is 1, then the alarm only transmits 1step and the level is also 1.

?If one node produces an alarm, then next second this node will produce alarms of the upper layers.

The minimum supports in the MFMA are decreasing from the business layer to the physical layer, and the decreasing intervals (recorded as d) are set objectively. So simulations are     taken out under different intervals. The results are shown in Fig.

4, which compares the number of frequent items for different MINSUP. As the value of minimum support increases, the number of frequent items decreases. And the MFMA can get more frequent items than the MFOA. This means the MFOA may lose useful frequent items. The MFMA is better than the MFOA. The bigger the d (decreasing interval) is, the more the frequent items are. So a reasonable minimum support and decreasing intervals have great significance on mining frequent items.

Minimum support vs number of frequent itemsets  In the result, alarms produced by central notes are all in frequent item-sets, and they all have high supports. This demonstrates that the two algorithms can correctly find the root alarm?s frequent item-sets.

Fig. 5 assumes d=0.02 and MINSUP=MIMSUP1=0.01. We can see from the figure that as the number of transactions increases, the execution time increases linearly. And the MFMA is smoother than the MFOA. The MFMA has a longer execution time than the MFOA, which is because the MFMA produces more frequent item-sets. As a conclusion, they both have a good scalability and efficiency.

Number of transactions vs Execution time  Fig. 6 shows that as the value of the minimum confidence increases, the number of association rules decreases. And the MFMA can get more association rules in the state of same MINCONF. So the MFMA can present the right alarms transmission accurately, and a reasonable minimum confidence has large effect on mining frequent items.

This means the two algorithms can correctly find rules which present the right alarms transmission. And then we can use these rules to locate the root faults.



VI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The scalability and efficiency of the MFMA and the MFOA  are demonstrated by the experiments. Mining multi-level fuzzy association rules of the alarms in communication network is demonstrated as a useful method to find the relationship between alarms to locate the faults. The multiple minimum supports setting strategy is better than one minimum support setting strategy.
