Application of Associate Rules Mining on CGF's Behavior Modeling

Abstract-In this paper, Computer Generated Forces (CGF) behavior modeling was studied from the viewpoint of associate  data mining, for the large quantity of data, rules and models in  its process. Because CGF behavior models data source was the combination of static DB and dynamic data stream, the paper  advanced the methods of item truncation and aim-pattern restriction. Through pretreatment, coding, searching frequent  pattern, generating associate rules of the CGF behavior  modeling data, then decision could be made according as these rules. Application of the two methods improves on the classical  aprior algorithm, also improves efficiency of searching frequent items and credibility of CGF's decision. Finally, the  application of associate rules mining in air-combat is studied in detail. As the simulation shows, comparing with the traditional  matching-rule decision, associate rule mining has higher  efficiency on condition with guaranteeing reliability of decision.

INTRODUCTION Computer generated forces are the simulation entities  generated and controIled by computer in the simulation environment. Through the adequate modeling of human's behavior, these entities can respond to events and states of the simulation environment automatically without human interaction [1]. CGF modeling consists of two aspects: The physical modeling and behavior modeling. Physical modeling is more mature, usually for the solution of dynamic models, also the methods of which are relatively fixed; but behavior models as involved in reasoning, decision-making, learning aspects and for the consideration of human behavior model, are much more complex. Selecting appropriate methods for CGF behavior modeling is a hot issue currently.

Behavior modeling is also named human behavior representation (HBR), which means modeling people's behavior or performance in military simulation [2].

Definition in NATO's L TSS/51 mainly includes: the executable model, individual and group behavior, command and control information system, analysis and process model, different aggregation levels.

CGF behavior modeling is the core technology of CGF, which was also included by MSMP as the study objectives.

Behavior model of a typical existing framework was the advanced rules engine (ARE) [3], whose model structure framework is shown below:  Behavior Modeling  Figure 1. Framework of ARE  For the large quantity of data, rules and models in the CGF simulation, how to seek the latent association relations, and how to feed back the latent association relations to the CGF simulation system so as to improve the CGF behavior modeling are two problems demanding prompt solution [4].

Reference [5] proposed a behavior modeling method based on FSM, although the structure is simple, clear, when facing the complex behavior and learning ability, it can do anything hardly. Reference [6] proposed a behavior modeling method based on agent, which is constrained by the multi-agent technology. There are also methods for behavior modeling based on control theory [7] or neural networks [8] and so on.

As we know, the OneSAF system of the U.S. military lays stress on the development of mining tools for collecting and analyzing the experimental data [9]. The OneSAF version 3.0 had implemented a management tool for mining the association relations of the CGF entities behaviors [10].

Smith and Saavedra presented a Data Collection Specification (DCS) file by which the user could select the specific roles, role types and the attributes used to coIlect data, and finally, the DCS was adopted by the OneSAF 3.0 software [11].

This paper wiIJ study CGF's behavior modeling from the perspective of associate rules mining methods. Section 2 introduces the concepts of data mining and what is the associate rules mining, also advances the basic principles of data mmmg technology, proposes the optimization algorithm .Section 3 studies the specific application in air? combat behavior modeling, and do some experiments to validate the validity of algorithm and the creditability of associate rules mining system. Section 4 summarizes the whole paper and discusses the challenges confronting us and the problems to be settled urgently.



II. PRINCIPLES OF DATA MINING  A. Basic concepts Data mining is a kind of knowledge discovery process  from database, also means a sort of non-trivial process which acquires effective, innovative, potentially useful and ultimately understandable knowledge from the database, data warehouse or other repository laying in large amounts of data (including the range of values, decision-making relationship, dynamic models) [12].

Frequent pattern is the pattern which appeared frequently in data sets (such as item sets, sequence or structure).For the measurement of frequent pattern, there are two indices, support and confidence.

Definition 1: Seting I = (IJ, 12, ... , 1m) is a collection of items, seting task-related data D is the set of database transactions, where each transaction T is a collection of items, and so T <;;; 1 , seting A is an itemset, the transaction T contains A if and only if A <;;; T ,association rules is the implicative like A => B ,where A c I, Be I.and AnS=0 0  Rule A=> B is established in the transaction set D,we name that the support is the percent of containing AU B in the transaction D, the confidence is the percent of containing A and B at the same time in the transaction D. viz.

Support: support(A => B) = peA U B)  Confidence: confidence(A => B) = PCB I A)  The rules satisfYing of the minimum support and minimum confidence are called strong rules.

Definetion2: Rule credibility: The rules credibility generated by a item and the rest of  all the items is called the rules credibility generated by the item, the minimum of rule credibility generated by all the items of a frequent itemsets is called rule credibility of this frequent itemsets  B. Association Rules Mining Association rules mining is to discover the aSSOCIatIOn  relations that are concealed within, unknown by us in advance, yet potentially useful, from the large quantity of things and their taken values. Association mining is a sort of practical techniques in information science. Association rules mining can be viewed as a two-step process:  I) IdentifY all the frequent itemsets; 2) Generate the strong association rules by frequent  itemsets.

The classical association mining algorithms are: (1) Aprior algorithm; (2) Based on frequent pattern growth algorithm; (3) Algorithm using vertical data format Among them, (2) and (3) are on the basis of (I) which is  improved and optimized. The three algorithms above are major for the static relational database for data mining, and then find frequent pattern as the input of intelligent decision? making ultimately.

The main idea of the general aprior algorithm is to find frequent k item when the iteration equals k (k> = 2), according to frequent itemsets (k-I) to form candidate  frequent itemsets k and scan the database once, and  completely set collection Lk? For CGF behavior models data source is the combination  of staticDB and dynamic data stream, classical aprior algorithm can not meet. Therefore, the algorithm can not be directly applied on the solution of the problems, it need to be optimized.

In this paper, it proposes an optimized aprior algorithm.

The main improvements are:  1) Using of truncation techniques. General mining algorithm does not allow duplicate entries, but in practice there may be duplicates, thus truncation technique is used to truncate the data set. The core steps of truncation are: first, scan the current data stream until appearing the iterant item, at this time, consider the current stream as an item; second, apply a new location of an item and continue scaning the data stream ahead, if current steam is over, well then scan the data stream of next sequence .When using truncation techniques to truncate the data stream, However ,it do not remove, so the number of sequence numbers doesn't change.

2) Restriction for the target pattern. Target pattern, also known as family association rules pattern, means a pattern that the antecedent and the consequent has more high associated character (confidence), and the support of the antecedent and the consequent are in the same range. It mainly avoids the loss of large numbers of rules (the support of large numbers of data in the data set is very low, only a few items'support is high. The small number of items whose support is very high, impact the settings of minimum support threshold, the result is a large number of items with low support can not be formed between the minimum threshold of support to meet the german rules, resulting in a loss of a large number of rules).

3) Using rules of frequent patterns generated confidence measure. Through the support and confidence thresholds set, we can obtain former rules, strong rules. As not all of them are what we need, its non-target model should be removed using concept of credibility.



III. AIR COMBAT SIMULATION BASED ON OPTIMIZED APRIOR  data viewed  Figure 2. flow chart of air-combat data ming  As Shown in Figure 2, all the data in the process of data mining could be viewed. The number of data mining step is five. First, select sample from combat training database to  V5-280     form the target making -decision database. Second, through pretreatment, the data has removed the redundancy. Third, transform the data after pretreatment, and at this time, the data we acquired could be mining. Fourth, we should use the appropriate algorithm to mining the information that is the knowledge, In the end, we should explain and evaluate the data information to gain the target rule thereby.

A. Fighting data preparation Actually, air-combat training will produce a variety of  data, data filtration is very important. According to redundancy, the value of vacancy ,we will assure integrity and validation of data .

By DCS files, we can choose a specific role, select the type of role, and design attribute information of gathered data. The output files of simulation results were formated, including three output formats: CSV, XML and binary files. Simulation nodes represent the basic unit of simulation. Management control tools read information from the DCS file to control the whole simulation process. Data collection specification tool and DCS files can read and write information to each other.

According to the classical tactics action library , we extract 25 kinds of movements to form a tactical library: 1, straight line; 2, constant circling; 3 front tracking; 4, subduction growth; 5, oblique pull; 6, emergency pull up; 7 , pure track; 8, half a catty flip bucket; 9, jumped a half roll; 10, high overload the roller; 11, under the rolling high overload; 12, to avoid turning; 13, anxious to avoid; 14 turns the growth rate; 15, snake mobility; 16, tube rolling; 17, anxious hovering; 18, outside a large slope change; 19, rotary; 20, acute increase in turn; 21, turns sharply down; 22, fell back; 23, half roll back; 24, High Speed Yo -Yo; 25, Low Speed Y 0-Y o.

In air-combat, red side and blue side always choose different strategies so as to be against each other. Database can be obtained by collecting rules applied in many times of air combat training. Record them using the standard form as table 1 shown:  TABLE! AIR COMBAT RULES SET  Rule Time Red action Blue action Rule I I haIf a catty flip bucket emergency pull up Rule 2 2 anxious hovering High Speed Yo -Yo  Rule n n Action n Action n'  B. Fighting association rule mining In this paper, we compared traditional data mining with  air-combat data mining ,then established the following mapping as table 2 shown:  TABLE I!. DATA MINING AND AERIAL MAPPING OF THE TRADITIONAL DATA MINING  Traditional data mining Air-combat data mining item air -combat data pattern  business a whole air-combat support support of obiect pattern  confidence reliability of rule . .

By way of tradItIOnal data mmmg correspondmg WIth the air-combat, we can see that associated reasoning based on data mining is a process acquiring new knowledge by the interaction between the main body and the environment. In other words, data mining can generate associate rules, which overcomes the shortcomings of traditional method which achieve structural rules by hand. Thereby it makes the structural rules dynamic and rules update online.

For the course of fighting action change constantly, we need to fill its database dynamically, so in the choice of data mining algorithms, it should be achieved by dynamic mining algorithm. In this paper, the optimization Aprior mining algorithm was used.

First, coding rules. Coding based on their side and action. Respective parties in accordance with the red side as l,and the blue side as 2, the action was encoded in accordance with its serial number. For example, in one battle, the red side executed on the 2nd movement "steady hover", the code was 12. the blue side executed on the 16th movement, the code was 216.

Second, establishing the itemsets. We produced an air stream as an item, because the data stream of data is very large, the example is shown as below.

Fmally, accordmg to the optImIzatIOn aprIor algOrIthm to  generate the frequent itemsets, we use the rule credibility, minimum confidence and support to deduce, and filtrate the objective pattern to form association rules.

V5-281     C. Simulation results After data mining which based on optimization aprior  algorithm, we acquired association rules effectively, and also they could be used in decision-making of air-combat.

In this paper, the experimental systems are setting the minimum support =0.6, minimum confidence =0.3, the resulting dynamic association rule set as shown:  TASLE V.

Simulation results can be verified by s?Fing up relative verification system.

Figure 4. air-combat simulation  As shown in figure 4, there is an air-combat simulation.

Blue side fighters begin flighting from the starting position ,avoid turning, anxious hovering, inverted half-roll, rapid circling, pulling up and so on; the red side fighters circled the implementation of the emergency, tracking, rapid circling, high-speed Y 0- Yo and other movements. Showing a scissors-shaped sides fighting situation, this is consistent with the real rules of war.

D. The results Measuring by the target support and the rules of  credibility, the data mining produces new rules to ensure the  rules which are a pilot interest in, and the credibility of the model behavior.

To verifY the reliability of air-combat data mining , we use (1) as the credibility (indicated with C) of air-combat data mining.

IV. CONCLUSION  In this paper, associate rules mining was applied in the CGF behavior modeling by optimizing the aprior algorithm.

This algorithm could deal with the database of combination of staticDB and dynamic data stream. According to the steps of associate rules mining, experiments had been done to acquire the useful rules, also applied these rules to the decision of air-combat. And a lot of work was completed to verifY the creditability and efficiency of air-combat based on the associate rules mining. As the result shown, the creditability of data mining air-combat is 1.396 times in average, and also consuming time is much lower than the general system which is matching rules. CGF behavior modeling is a very broad field that need lucubrate. As known to all, association rules mining is widely used, it could deal with the complex behavior effectively.

Though the associate rules mining-based CGF behavior modeling has made certain achievements, it is still faced with many challenges. Such as the real-time issue of decision and other problems, so a lot of work will be done in this field to find solutions.
