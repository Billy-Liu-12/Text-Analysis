Keywords-Grey Cluste; Association Rule; Data Mining; Apriori  Algorithm; The Appraisal for Archive Objective Management  The appraisal for University Archives Objective Management is a complicated system[1]. The archives work can be greatly improved by strengthening the appraisal. In the appraisal for University Archives Objective Management, traditional weighting appraisal is simple and straightforward.

However, people can not learn distribution condition of archive work in various appraisal classes only from an abstract and integrated score. Adopting grey clustering algorithm can carry out objective quantification appraisal to university archive work objective management[2]. This paper based on the example, presents the appraisal classification, establishes an evaluation model and gives an example using the Grey Clustering for clear and reliable evaluation. This paper further utilizes the Association Rule and obtains related data from a university?s database to find the internal relations between the university and the appraisal result[3][4], based on the improved Apriori Algorithm[5].



I. GREY CLUSTERING ALGORITHM AND ASSOCIATION RULE  We can find individual type in the organization through Grey clustering algorithm and data extracted from the database [6]. In addition, we can also judge which category the individual belongs to. Grey clustering is to classify clustering objective for different clustering indices in accordance with several grey categories to judge which category the clustering objective belongs to. At first, mark n kinds of individuals to be appraised integrally as clustering objective. Item p appraisal index is marked as clustering index[7][8]. Carry out standardization treatment to original data of n individual p index, then confirm various grey intervals, define whitening weight function and whitening  weight coefficient. In the end, calculate grey clustering coefficient matrices of the i-th objective or grey clustering coefficient matrices of an individual in certain grey category.

You can obtain grey category of the individual and then grey category of various samples as well as corresponding appraisal class result in accordance with grey clustering coefficient matrices[9].

Generally, the association rule is applied to transaction database. Where each transaction is composed of a record set.

Associated algorithm excavated by the data is to important contact in data item and decide concurrent occurring order of events. Apriori algorithm belongs to Boolean association rule.

It is a typical association algorithm for data excavation.

Basic association rule excavation step: at first, find frequent item set. Find all frequent item set through minimal support degree given by the user, namely not a less entry value. The association rule generation foundation is to find all frequent item set; follow the generated association rule. Through the minimal credibility given by the user, intensively find not a less association rule in each maximal frequent item.



II. APPLICATION OF GREY CLUSTERING ALGORITHM IN THE APPRAISAL FOR UNIVERSITY ARCHIVE  OBJECTIVE  MANAGEMENT  A. Selection of university archive  objective management evaluation index The appraisal for University archive objective  management is a comprehensive appraisal based on several indices. By seeking expertise, the study confirms indices on 6 aspects as the comprehensive appraisal index: archive system mechanism(P1), archive organization and management(P2), archive condition guarantee(P3), archive foundation business(P4), archive development and utilization(P5) and archive informatization construction(P6).

Full mark of various indices is 100. Appraisal experts carry out objective appraisal in accordance with the appraisal index.

B. Application design of grey clustering algorithm appraisal model (1) Design of appraisal matrix Expert appraisal data in the database can not be directly  applied to the appraisal for archive objective management. It  ??B  Proc. 11th IEEE Int. Conf. on Cognitive Informatics & Cognitive Computing (ICCI*CC?12) K. Sugawara, Y. Wang, F. Hattori, T. Nishida, S. Fujita, W. Kinsner & L.A. Zadeh (Eds.)      is necessary to carry out data processing with statistical software to obtain average grade of experts on various appraisal indices for university archive work.

Q  (5)   (3) Confirm weight of appraisal index To carry out comprehensive appraisal, you must consider  function of various factors on the appraisal class, namely weight. It is the significance level of a certain factor in the factor concentration. It indicates influence degree of the factor change to the appraisal result when other factors maintain unchanged.

Let ! "1, 2, 6j j[ ? ? be the weight of appraisal indices.

The weight shall meet normalization requirement:     j j  [ ?  ?C                         (6) After appraising significance level of various appraisal  indices experts confirm weights of various appraisal indices are respectively 1 0.10[ ? , 2 0.20[ ? , 3 0.20[ ? , 4 0.20[ ? ,  5 0.20[ ? , 6 0.10[ ? .For weight of various appraisal indices, see table .

TABLE I WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION SHEET OF VARIOUS APPRAISAL INDICES   (4) Appraisal principle of grey clustering Grey clustering is based on whitening function  generation foundation of grey number. Induce and arrange whitening number of clustering objective to different clustering indices in accordance with k grey category to judge which category the clustering objective belong to. The method is called statistical method.

According to equation (7), find clustering factor of appraisal objective i in category k clustering factor:    ( )k ki j ij j  j f x? [  ?  ? C ?                            (7) 1 2 3 4( , , , )( 1,2, )i i i i i i n? ? ? ? ?? ? ?  is called clustering  factor vector of appraisal objective i.

TABLE III GREY CLUSTERING APPRAISAL OF ARCHIVE OBJECTIVE MANAGEMENT  Grey clustering coefficient NO.

M1 M2 M3 M4 M5 M6 M7 M8 M9 M10  A 0.17 0.46  0.98 0.29 0.9  0.22 0.27   B 0.55 0.4  0.02 0.57 0.1 0.05 0.61 0.69 0.06  C 0.28 0.14 0.25  0.14  0.73 0.17 0.04 0.52  D  0.35  0.22  0.42  Grey category    B A D A B A C B B C   According to maximal membership grade principle, it is  displayed in table 3 that M2 M4 and M6 in the university archive management departments are belong to A grey category for comprehensive appraisal of archive objective management, where M4 exceeds M6,M6 exceeds M2; M1 M5 M8 and M9 are belong to B grey category, where M9 exceeds M8,M8 exceeds M5,M5 exceeds M1; M7 and M10 are belong to C grey category, where M7 exceeds M10; M3 is belong to D grey category.

However, maximal membership grade principle has following two corrupt practices. The first is that when two comprehensive appraisal results in same rank have same membership grade, it is unnecessary to carry out effective comparison. The second is that when several ranks are related to same maximal membership grade in a comprehensive appraisal result, it is unnecessary to confirm the rank. In order to overcome above insufficiency, we introduce the approximated rank evaluation method. We confirm membership grade of the objective appraised to the  appraisal rank based on various ranks in table 3 to obtain the comprehensive appraisal result.

To appraise intensive V, assign 1 to the supreme rank and 0 to the inferior rank in A, B, C and D. Subtract 1 from coefficient number in appraisal intensive V to divide the rank region. The region [0, 1] can be divided into 0 0.33  0.33 0.66 0.66 1.0  three regions. The rank matrix A 1 0.66 0.33 0  is formed by taking various classification values as the element.

1.0 0.66 0.33  A  A < ? : ? :? ? ? : ? : @ ;     Take M2 in table 3 as the example, the appraisal result is  A in accordance with the maximal membership principle.

Let 2 2B A?? F ?   , and     1.0 0.66  (0.46 0.40 0.14 0) 0.757 0.33  B  A < ? : ? :? ? ? : ? : @ ;       To carry out rank appraisal, compare appraisal result B2 and rank parameter in the rank matrix. Value B2 belongs to the rank most close to the rank parameter. It is obviously value B2 is close to rank parameter 0.66 of B. Therefore, the appraisal result is B. Appraisal rank of M2 is adjusted in this way. In addition, B2 can also be converted to a specific score form. It is assumed that the full mark is 100 and the comprehensive appraisal mark is 75.

We can see that grey clustering algorithm divides archive objective management rank of universities involved in accordance with maximal principle of grey clustering factor, confirm distribution condition in various appraisal rank.

Furthermore, in grey clustering coefficient, it displays membership degree of these university archive management department to different archive work objective management rank classification. Similar rank evaluation appraisal method supplements rank appraisal. Both factors provide reliable basis for integrally learning archive management work of universities.

Extract 6,875 appraisal records of experts to various appraisal indices from the appraisal for archive objective management database of certain university. Through grey clustering algorithm and similar rank evaluation appraisal method, we can obtain objective management appraisal result grade distribution of archive work in various  ???    universities. It can be represented in a histogram as below:  Archive work objective management appraisal result rank distribution of  universities in a province  Appraisal result rank  U ni  ve rs  ity q  ua nt  ity   Fig. 1 the histogram of archive work objective management  appraisal result grade distribution of universities in a province

III. APPLICATION OF ASSOCIATION RULE IN THE APPRAISAL FOR UNIVERSITY ARCHIVE  OBJECTIVE MANAGEMENT  A. Associated transaction library generated Apply association rule excavation algorithm to the  appraisal for archive objective management to further find internal link among data. We further extract data of some subjective assumptions closely related to appraisal result from background database of universities in the province, including university establishment history, student scale and library holdings. Combine these related attribute extracted and appraisal rank result information table of experts into a table to provide data excavation objective for the whole association data excavation module. Here, we adopt improved Apriori algorithm. Because Apriori algorithm is applicable to data excavation of transaction library, we must convert relation table to the corresponding transaction library.

A record in the relation table is taken as an affair. Field values in the record are converted to related items in accordance with the code table (see table ). For example, a record below: Establishment history                    Student scale  31 50years                   10001 20000students Library holdings           Appraisal result More than30000 volumes                        C   It is converted to the transaction below: {L3 L7 L12 L14} For some transactions in transaction database, see table  .

B. Frequent item set generated After the transaction library is generated, adopt improved  Apriori algorithm to find frequent K item set in accordance with minimal support degree assigned. The method is given below:  According to Apriori algorithm, convert transaction database to 0 1 matrix. eg. for 0 1 matrix of table , see table ; find out frequent item set meeting the condition in accordance with 0 1 matrix.

TABLE IV CODE TABLE  Item Value Code 1 10years L1  11 30 years L2  31 50 years L3 Establishment  history More than 50  years L4  Less than 5000 students L5  5000 10000 students L6  10001 20000 students L7  Student scale  More than 20000 students L8  Less than 5000 volumes  L9  5000 20000 volumes  L10  20001 30000 volumes  L11  Library holdings  More than 30000 volumes  L12  D L13  C L14  B L15 Appraisal  result A L16  TABLE V SOME TRANSACTIONS IN TRANSACTION DATABASE  TID Item list T1 L1,L5,L9,L13  T2 L2,L6,L10,L14  T3 L2,L7,L10,L15  T4 L3,L7,L11,L14  T5 L4,L7,L12,L16  T6 L3,L8,L11,L15  T7 L4,L6,L10,L15  T8 L1,L6,L9,L14  T9 L3,L7,L11,L15  T10 L4,L8,L12,L16  MIN. SUPPORT DEGREE 15% AND MIN. CONFIDENCE DEGREE 65%  C. Generated association rule base After the frequent item set is generated, find all possible  proper subsets for any frequent K set. As first component of association rule, calculate confidence of related rules. When confidence of a rule is greater than the minimal confidence assigned, output the rule.

D. Association result and analysis  In order to find internal relation between basic condition of universities and expertise result, extract more than 500 related data from background database of universities in the  ???    TABLE VI 0~1 MATRIX CORRESPONDING WITH TABLE   A < ? : ? : ? : ? : ? : ? : ? : ? : ? : ? : ? : ? : ? : ? :@ ;    province as the excavation objective of associated data to excavate association rule in objective management evaluating system of university archive work.  Include Establishment history Student scale Library holdings.

Set the minimal support degree as 15% and minimal confidence as 65 , 30 rules are excavated all together. E.g.: in "when library holdings rolls are more than 30,000 ] B support: 55% confidence:67.5 " rule, 55% support degree indicates that library holdings rolls are more than 30,000 and the records with B as the appraisal result occupy 55%. 67.5% confidence indicates that in the associated database, appraisal result for 67.5% universities with more than 30,000 library holdings roll is B; in " more than 50-year establishment history and 10,001 - 20,000 student population ] A support: 35% confidence:48.3 " rule, 35% support degree indicates that in associated database, 35% records meet the condition with more than 50-year establishment history, 10,001 - 20,000 student population and A appraisal result. 48.3% confidence indicates that in associated database, 48.3% universities with 50-year history and 10,001-20,000 student population are appraised as A.

We can find from the comprehensive analysis that three factors(Establishment history Student scale Library holdings)are significantly related to archive work objective management appraisal of universities, which are consistent  with the assumption, namely archive management departments of universities with long establishment history, large scale student population, abundant library holdings are given high objective management appraisal in archive work.



IV. SUMMARY AND PROSPECT Through data excavation, we can find knowledge mode  and rule in the organization. The paper discusses application of grey clustering algorithm and association rule in the appraisal for university archive objective management to carry out  clustering analysis to the appraisal for university archive objective management so as to judge type of the appraisal for university archive objective management, find internal relation between universities and expertise result, which has theoretic and realistic guiding meaning to university archive management work. As a university archive clerk, you must find gap based on scientific appraisal and analysis so as to carry out archive objective management work well.

As a mature method, grey clustering method and association rule can also be widely applied to other appraisal regions of universities, such as teaching administration system appraisal and classroom instruction quality assessment. The method introduces mathematical model and computer information technology to appraisal of archive work objective management to provide new study visual angle for investigators. Archive work objective management estimator shall further improve archive work objective management appraisal system to release standards so as to clear and optimize data, unify database structure, enrich database information, refer to successful experience of data excavation technology in other areas in accordance with standards so as to further improve objective management appraisal system of university archive work to a scientific, comprehensive, reliable and efficient direction.
