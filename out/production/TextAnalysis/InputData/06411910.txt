High-Performance Turbo-MIMO System Design with

Abstract?In turbo-multiple-input multiple-output (Turbo-  MIMO) systems, the soft-output MIMO detector can provide the  priori information to the turbo decoder. Unfortunately, if  Rayleigh fading channels are applied, the induced unreliable  priori information would cause the system performance  degradation. In this paper, we proposed an iterative method to  acquire the high reliability priori information from MIMO soft-  detector in Turbo-MIMO systems. Similar to the conventional  updating rules in the turbo decoding algorithm, we utilize the  extrinsic information from the turbo decoder to update the log-  likelihood ratios (LLRs) based on log-MAP algorithm in the list  sphere decoding (LSD) algorithm. To reduce the overall  computational complexity, different iteration profiles are also  discussed. Simulation results show that the proposed Turbo-  MIMO system can significantly improve the system performance  compared to that of the conventional Turbo-MIMO system.



I. INTRODUCTION  Multiple-input multiple-output technique has been  widely used in recent wireless communication standards.

Under the limited bandwidth, each transmitted antennas can  transmit different signals to increase the transmission rate,  which are called as spatial multiplexing mode. To recover  transmitted signals in receiver, various MIMO detection  algorithms have been presented in [1]-[4]. One is the linear  detection methods which use zero-forcing (ZF) or minimum  mean square error (MMSE) criterion to generate the channel  matrix inverse and then multiply its matrix by received signal  vector. Although linear detection methods have low  computational complexity, the bit error rate (BER)  performance is not sufficient, especially in low signal to noise  ratio (SNR) environments. Another method is the maximum  likelihood (ML) scheme [1]. An optimal solution is obtained  by minimizing the Euclidean distance between the received  signals and the possible signal candidates. Since the ML  scheme is equivalently to the exhaustive search method, a  large computational complexity is required in MIMO systems  with high modulation constellations. To simplify the  exponentially complex search problem in ML detector, the  sphere detectors are presented in [2]-[4] to achieve near-ML  performance with reasonable complexity. Since these  detectors only find the most possible transmitted signals,  these methods are called as hard-output MIMO detector.  For  enhancing system performance, the soft-output MIMO  detectors are presented in [5]-[7] to approximate the  maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) detection and  provide soft outputs, which are called as list sphere detector  (LSD) [5]. Compared to the hard-output detectors, the soft-  output MIMO detectors not only obtain the most possible  candidates, but also remain some transmitted signal  candidates.

In recent years, a Turbo-MIMO system which combines  soft-output detector and Turbo decoder is considered to  improve system performance. The soft-output MIMO detector  is like as inner decoding to provide soft-input decisions to the  outer turbo decoder. Furthermore, the turbo-principle can be  applied between the soft-output MIMO detector and the outer  decoder performing iterative detection and decoding. Since  the off-the-self turbo decoder only generates the soft  information of symmetric bits, the amount of the updated soft  information between soft-output MIMO detector and the  turbo decoder are different. Hence, the soft-input decisions of  the turbo decoder cannot be fully updated by iterative  detection and decoding. In this paper, we proposed an  iterative method to acquire the high reliability priori  information from MIMO soft-output detector by the modified  updating algorithm. To reduce the overall computational  complexity, the different iteration profiles are also discussed.

Compared to the conventional Turbo-MIMO system, our  system performance can be significantly improved when the  modified updating algorithm and selected iteration profile are  applied. This rest of paper is organized as follows. In Section  II, we present the system model of turbo-MIMO systems and  some related soft information computations. Section III  introduces the proposed soft information updating algorithm  and discusses different iteration profiles. Section IV shows  the simulation results. Finally, conclusions are shown in  Section V.



II. TURBO-MIMO SYSTEM MODEL  We consider the turbo-MIMO system model which consists  M transmit antennas and N receive antennas in Fig. 1, where  N ? M. At the transmitter, the Ku information bits are encoded  by using convolutional or turbo encoder with rate Rc and then  the codeword c=[c1, c2, ?,cK] T are generated, where K=Ku?Rc.

To combat error bursts, the interleaver operation, which is  represented by ?, is applied to permute the coded bits. After interleaved operations, the permuting coded bits will pass to  modulation to form symbol sequences. These symbol    sequences are transmitted in parallel from the M transmit  antennas and represented as s=[s1,s2, ?, sM] T , where sm is  modulation symbol of xk and xk is a Mc?1 vector of data bits  on kth symbols. In Fig.1, the channel impulse response from  the ith receive antennas and jth transmit antennas are denoted  as hi,j and the channel matrix  H with dimension N-by-M are  shown as:    1,1 1,  ,1 ,  M  N N M  h h  h h  =  ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?? ?  H  ?  ? ? ?  ?  .  (1)  Let the transmitting signal vector s pass to the MIMO channel,  the received signal vector y=[y1 y2 ? yN] T can be represented  as follows.

y=Hs+n,  (2)  where n=[n1, n2, ?, nN] T is an independently identical  distributed additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) with zero-  mean. At the receiver, the soft-output MIMO detector is  applied to find the candidate nodes which include some  possible transmitted symbols. In addition, we select LSD as  soft-output MIMO detector and take received signal vector  and a priori knowledge LA1 on the inner coded bits to compute  new intrinsic soft information LE1. Through the deinterleaver  operation, which is denoted as ?-1, the LE1 is changed to the a priori information LA2 into the turbo decoder. In the turbo  decoder, we can use maximum a posteriori (MAP) [8] or  Bahl-Cocke-Jelinek-Raviv (BCJR) [9] algorithm to produce  extrinsic information LE2 on the outer code bits. Then, the LE2  pass through re-interleave operation and fed back as a priori  knowledge LA1 to the soft-output MIMO detector. It is worth  noting that the subscript ?1? and ?2? denote processing blocks  that are connected to MIMO detector and turbo decoder,  respectively. After completing information exchange between  the subscript ?1? and ?2?, it means that one iterative  computation is performed. In the MIMO detector, the intrinsic  soft information for the lth bit on the kth symbol are shown as   ( , ) ( , ) ( , )  1 1 1  k l k l k l  D A EL L L= + ,  (3)  where the superscript (k,l) denotes this soft information for lth  bit on kth symbol. The ( , )   k l  E L can expressed by  { } { }  , , 1  , , 1   [ , ] 1,[ , ]2  ( , )    [ , ] 1,[ , ]2  1 1 exp  2 2 ln  1 1 exp  2 2  k l  k l  T  k l A k l  xk l  E  T  k l A k l  x  L ?  ?  +  ?  ??  ??  ? ? + ?  =  ? ? + ?  ? ? ? ?? ?  ? ? ? ?? ?  ?  ?  y Hs x L  y Hs x L  . (4)  ,where [ , ]k l  x  denotes the information bit vector with omitting  xk,l and LA1,[k,l] is equal to LA1 with omitting the value of ( , )   k l  A L .

, , 1k l + ? and  , , 1k l ? ? are the set of  12 cM M? ? bit vectors x which  include the xk,l=+1 and xk,l=-1, repressively. The detailed  derivations are shown in [4]. Through the Max-log  approximation which proposed in [9], (4) can be represented  as    [ ]{ } [ ]{ }  , , 1  , , 1   [ , ] 1, ,2   [ , ] 1, ,2  ( , )   1 1 max  2 2  1 1 max  2 2  k l  k l  T  k l A k l x  T  k l A k l x  k l  EL ?  ?  +  ?  ??  ??  ? ? ? + ?  ? ? ? + ?  y Hs x L  y Hs x L  .  (5)  Similar to turbo decoder, (4) and (5) are called as Max-log  MAP and Log-MAP solutions, respectively.



III. PROPOSED ITERATIVE TURBO-MIMO SYSTEM  In this section, we consider an iterative system with the  combination of soft-output MIMO detector and off-the-self  turbo decoder.  For the soft-MIMO detector, LSD is applied  to find the candidate list. To avoid system degradation due to  Max-log approximation, we use the log-MAP algorithm to  compute the extrinsic information. In addition, we utilize the  extrinsic information from turbo decoder to update the log-  likelihood ratios (LLRs) based on log-MAP algorithm in LSD  algorithm. Unfortunately, the conventional turbo decoder only  calculates the extrinsic information of systematic bits. Since  the amount of updated soft information between LD1 and LD2  are inconsistent, the unreliable priori information for parity-  check bits would be occurred, especially for considering  Rayleigh fading channels. Hence, the following subsection  will describe how to introduce the extrinsic information of  parity check bits and a modified updating rule in the proposed  iterative turbo-MIMO system. Furthermore, the different  iteration profiles are also discussed to reduce the  computational complexity.

A. Introduce the log-MAP algorithm to compute parity- check information  In this section, we consider turbo decoding with serial  concatenation scheme [10] which achieves the integration  with two elementary decoders. Firstly, let Sk denote the set  state transitions on time k, which are shown as Sk={(s,s?)},  where s are s? denote the index of current state and next state,  respectively. According to the value of systematic bit dsym, the  state transitions can be divided into 0dsym  k  =  S and 1dsym  k  =  S . In  1DL1EL  1A L  2AL  2E L  2D L   Fig. 1 Turbo-MIMO block diagram    addition, 0d parity  k  =  S and 1d parity  k  =  S are denoted as the two set of  state transitions which correspond to the value of parity-check  bit dparity. Fig. 2(a) and 2(b) show the trellis diagram with  generator polynomial G(D)=1/(1+D ) for systematic bit and  parity-check bit, respectively. Hence, we can find 0dsym  k  =  S ={(0,0),  (1,2), (2,1), (3,3)}, 1dsym  k  =  S ={(0,2), (1,0), (2,3), (3,1)}, 0d parity  k  =  S ={(0,0),  (1,0), (2,1), (3,1)}, and 1d parity  k  =  S ={(0,2), (1,2), (2,3), (3,3)}.  Similarly to  the original MAP algorithm for symmetric bits, the intrinsic  soft information  parity  D L for parity-check bits based on  0d parity  k  =  S and 1d parity  k  =  S are shown as    ( ) ( ) ( )  ( ) ( ) ( )  1 1  0 1  , ,  ln , ,  ( ) k k k  s s  k k k  s s  p k  x s s s s  LLR x s s s s  d  ? ? ?  ? ? ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ? ?? ?  = ? ?? ?  ??  ?? , (6)  where the encoded bit dk  is belonged to parity-check bit dparity  and the forward recursion can be expressed as:  ( ) ( ) ( )  ( ) ( )        , ,  , ,  i k k  s i  k  i k k  s s i  x s s s  s  x s s s  ? ?  ?  ? ?  ?  ? =  ?  ? =  ? ?  ? =  ? ?  ??  ??? .  (7)  If q=0 then ?0(s?)=1. Otherwise, ?0(s?)=0. The backward  recursion can be defined as:  ( ) ( ) ( )  ( ) ( )   1 1      , ,  , ,  i k k  s i  k  i k k  s s i  x s s s  s  x s s s  ? ?  ?  ? ?  + +  =  +  ? =  ? ??  =  ? ??  ??  ??? .  (8)  If p=0 then ?N(s)=1. Otherwise, ?N(s)=0. The branch  transition probabilities are given by  ( ) ( ) ( )  ( ) ( )  , , , | | , ,  | , | ; 0,1  sym Parity Parity sym  i k k k parity k parity  parity r  x x s s p x d i p x d i s s  q d i s s P s s i  ? ? ?= = ? = ?  ? ?= ? =  ? ?? ? ,  where q(dparity=i |s,s?)=1 depending dparity is associated with  the state transition and equals 0 if it is not. Pr(s?|s) is a fixed  value dependent on a priori probabilities of dparity. Table I  shows the modified soft-information updating rule in LLR  form. Firstly, we take the received signal vector and the  corresponding a priori information LA1 which are initialized  to zero to compute new intrinsic soft information LE1. Then,  LE1 execute deinerleaver operation ? -1  and produce the a  priori information LA2. In the turbo decoder, the MAP  algorithm is applied to generate the intrinsic soft information   sym  D L  for symmetric bits by iterative operations. The notation  iterturbo  is defined as the maximum iteration number for turbo  decoding, which is actually set to 8. Furthermore, according  to (6), the intrinsic soft information  parity  D L for each parity-  check bits can be computed. Hence, we can use these intrinsic  soft information and a priori information LA2 to compute the  extrinsic information LE2.  Then, the LE2 pass through re-  interleave operation and fed back as a priori knowledge LA1.

The above procedures are executed in an outer iteration and  the maximum outer iteration is denoted as iterouter .

B. Discussion on different iteration profiles  In this subsection, we consider different the value of iterturbo and iterouter. In [5], the Turbo-MIMO systems consider  iterturbo=8 and iterouter=4 without computing LLR for parity-  check bits, which are denoted as LLRp. Hence, the number of  turbo decoder computation is 45. Since (6) is similar to  original LLR computation, we assume an LLRp computation  is equal to execute one turbo decoder computation. To  increase the reliability of value of LLRp, the value of iterouter  would set to a high value to update LLRp several times. In  Table II, different iteration profiles are considered in the   (a)                      (b)  Fig. 2(a) Trellis diagram for considering symmetric bits (b) Trellis  diagram for considering parity-check bits  TABLE I. MODIFIED SOFT-INFORMATION UPDATING RULE    Algorithm: Modified soft-information updating rule,  LLR form  Input: The channel matrix H and the received signal  vector y=[y1 y2 ? yN] T   Outputs: the a priori information LA1  Initialize: LA1=0  Begin  for j=0 to iterouter  LE1?LD1-LA1 , the computation is realized by (4)  LA2?? -1  (LE1)  for i=0 to iterturbo    sym  D L  ?   sym  D L  end (for i loop)   parity  D L ?LLRp for all parity-check bits by using (6)  2D L ?[   sym  D L   2  parity  D L ]  LE2?LD2-LA2  LA1?? -1  (LE2)  end (for j loop)  End      acceptable system performance. Since the turbo decoder  computation is critical computing for soft information  updating, we prefer choosing the lowest number of turbo  decoder computation. Hence, the iteration profile is selected  as iterturbor=4 and iterouter=6 under considering LLRp  computation in Turbo-MIMO systems.



IV. SIMULATION RESULTS  We consider a Rc=1/2 convolutional encoder with  feedback generator polynomial Gr(D)=1+D+D and  feedforward generator polynomial Gf(D)= 1+D . The  interleaver size of the turbo code is 9216 information bits. For  4?4 MIMO systems (M=4 and N=4), each transmitted symbol  with carrying 4 information bits (Mc=4) is generated by  16QAM modulation. At the receiver, we applied the LSD  algorithm with 512 candidate nodes to implement the soft-  output MIMO detector. When the average signal energy per  receive antenna is Es, the signal energy per transmitted  information bit at the receiver is Eb=(N/RcMMc) Es. Hence, the  modified SNR for Turbo-MIMO systems is given as  ( )  0 0  10 log 1 / 2 b s  dB dB  E E  N N = + .

The simulation results shown in Fig. 3 are given on Rayleigh  channel which generated by complex Gaussian distribution.

Since max-log MAP algorithm uses approximated LLRs, its  BER performance is worse than that of using log MAP  algorithm. Whether the LLRs are computed by max-log MAP  algorithm or log MAP algorithm, the performance gain with  respect to the proposed soft information updating rule is  0.2~0.3 dB at BER =10 -3  . According to Table II, we also  consider different iteration profiles in Fig. 3. Compared to  conventional iteration profile which is proposed in [5], the  iteration profile, which is selected as iterturbo=4 and iterouter=6,  has better performance. Since the LLRs for parity-check bits  can be updated several times as increasing the number of  iterouter, the intrinsic information is more reliable.



V. CONCLUSIONS  In this paper, an iterative method to acquire the high  reliability priori information from MIMO soft-detector by the  modified updating algorithm is presented. Through applying  the LLRs of the parity check bits and the new combination of  the iteration numbers into the Turbo-MIMO systems, we can  obtain about 0.4 dB gain than that of the original Turbo-  MIMO systems. Additionally, with the LLRs of the parity  check bits, the performance improvement obtained by  increasing the number of outer iteration processes is more  pronounced than that by increasing the number of iteration  processes of the turbo decoder.
