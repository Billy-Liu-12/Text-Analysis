Identifying and Blocking Pornographic Content

Abstract  Content filtering on the WWW is significant social issue,  since children can easily access pornography and other  illegal material with ease. In this study, a descriptive and  predictive model of pornographic web page  characteristics was developed, to assist with recognition  of pornographic pages in a content filter. Support and  confidence results from simple association rules suggest  that using individual terms to identify pornographic web  pages is useful for description, but unreliable for  prediction. However, Bayesian classification provided  99.1% accuracy in classifying test pages from both  pornographic and non-pornographic corpora. The  challenges for multimodal filtering are discussed.

1. Introduction  The WWW contains more than 4 billion pages of  diverse content. While it is a very rich source of  information, it also contains large amounts of illegal  matter, and material unsuitable for children, including  race, hate, violence and pornography. In contrast, some  adult surfers quite legitimately and legally access Internet  pornography. Most WWW users are typically only  interested in a small part of the web that is relevant to  them, governed by their interests and needs. The existence  of other web pages may be irrelevant to them, with  accidental exposure possibly undesirable. To both  children and adults, the web access experience will be  more pleasant and productive, if web pages not within  their interests and needs, are ranked lower in the lists  returned to them by search engines, or web pages  considered to be undesirable are not shown at all. To  companies and schools, the exclusion of shopping web  sites and pornography from web accesses of their  employees during office hours, for examples, creates a  more productive working environment, and reduces risk  due to vicarious liability. The aim of the current study is  to determine whether descriptive and predictive data  mining techniques can be successfully applied to  automatically classifying requested web pages as  acceptable or non-acceptable, based on user preferences  [1, 2]. The specific example used is pornography ? there  appear to be two very distinct classes of web user here ?  some deliberately seek it out, while others are annoyed by  accidentally being exposed to it.

Mabasher [3] first described web personalisation as  any action that makes the Web experience of a user  personalised to a user?s taste. The actions can range from  simply making a presentation more pleasing to an  individual, to anticipating the needs of the user, and  providing the right information. The scope of  personalisation goes beyond just the construction of web  pages suited to their tastes, but also the web they are  accessing ? in essence, a tailored-made virtual web.

Some web surfers are disgusted with the unintentional  access to pornographic materials embedded within SPAM  e-mail messages, or banner ?pop-up? advertisements. Of  great concern to families is that one in four children who  use the Internet is exposed to sexual material [4]. From the pornography statistics derived by the Family Save  Media [5], some 12% of total web sites can be considered  pornographic, while some 20% and 13% of men and  women respectively admitted to have accessed  pornography at work [5]. However, the current  technology, mainly the blacklisting of web sites,  employed by existing filtering products to filter unwanted  materials does not achieve a satisfactory result for either  the group who want to access pornography, or those who  never want to see it. This is where data mining can  potentially provide a solution, by creating an accurate  classifier that can discriminate between pornographic and  non-pornographic web pages. One can imagine that such  a classifier could be used in a search engine to optimise  search results for pornography, or could be used to block  access to such pages, based on user preference. The  blocking aspect is significant, given the limitations of  ?white listing? a set of hand-picked and verified sites, or  the ?black listing? of sites known to be unacceptable.

In this paper, we present the results of an investigation  into the identification of pornographic materials based on  the development of a descriptive and predictive model of  pornographic web page content. The aim is to (a)  determine the set of features or characteristics that  identify a page as being pornographic and (b) to develop a  classifier that can be used to predict, given a set of tokens  extracted from a web page and its constituent parts  (header, body, title etc.), whether any given page is  pornographic. The first part of our study focused on  identifying the characteristics of web pages based on their  structure and term distributions derived from a training  corpus of several thousand pages. The results of this work  indicate that the structure of pornographic web pages is     distinct from non-pornographic web pages, and that many  terms appear only within pornographic web sites, or  rarely in non-pornographic web pages.

The second part of our study focused on the  determination of simple association rules, using terms, to  identify unseen pornographic web pages. While the  association results were of great descriptive interest,  support and confidence results suggested that a predictive  model might be better able to predict category  membership. Thus, in the third part of our study, we  examined whether a Bayesian classifier could be used to  determine the probability that a requested web page  belongs to the pornographic class. The study show that  the classification accuracy of the Bayesian classifier was  99.1% on an unseen sample of some 258 pornographic  web pages, and 3,153 non-pornographic web pages, with  low false positive and false negative rates.

2. Modelling Pornographic Pages  A corpus of pornographic and non-pornographic web  pages was constructed to facilitate the analysis of textual  compositions and HTML structures in both categories.

The corpus comprised some 1,232 Pornographic web  pages sampled from 864 web sites, according to the adult  web site directory provided by the AltaVista Image search  engine, and 6,967 Non-Pornographic web pages from  5,040 sites, obtained by following links from the Google,  Yahoo and Infoseek directories.

The pornographic web pages sampled consisted of the  following 3 main groups:  ? Entry pages, which tell viewers that the web sites  contain adult material and are suitable only for  people of age 18 or higher. Some of these web  pages already contain photographs primarily of  women, though they may not be particularly erotic,  or considered as pornographic in their own right.

? Actual web pages that contain nude women (or  very occasionally men) and erotic material.

? Directories of pornographic web sites.

The non-pornographic web pages belonged to 18 sub-  groups of a different nature, each having around 400 web  pages. These groupings were not directly used in any of  the work that follows, but were sampled to reduce any  biases in the construction of the non-pornographic corpus.

Thus, the non-pornographic category is very broad by  design, although further studies could examine whether  specific sub-categories were more or less accurate in  terms of category prediction compared to pornographic  pages. The total number of web pages sampled was 8,199,  with 15% being pornographic and 85% non-pornographic.

1.1. Structural Modelling  A large number of structural differences between the  pages belonging to the pornographic and non-  pornographic categories were found, as shown in Table 1.

Some of these differences indicated an order of magnitude  difference in the pornographic category, compared to the  non-pornographic category. For example, only 0.8% of  non-pornographic web pages had more than five links to  images, while some 40% of pornographic pages did. The  analysis also showed that pornographic web pages were  linked to or embedded with more images, but were  relatively more standalone, linking to fewer other web  pages. Though fewer tokens were found in pornographic  web pages, a larger portion of them were being  highlighted. We also found that, by visually inspecting the  web pages collected, pornographic and non-pornographic  pages used different background colours - non-  pornographic pages tended to use white or light  background colours, while pornographic used much  darker ones. Only images of size greater than 40*40  pixels were counted, eliminating icons or ?section  separators?. The links to other HTML pages include same  site or external web site references, and the only tokens  tagged within <b> </b>, or <font> </font> and having  large font size or colour other than black were counted.

Pornographic Non-pornographic  74% have more  than 5 images  32% have more than  5 images  Image count  60% have more  than 10 images  13% have more than  10 images  73% have more  than 5 links  85% have more than  5 links  Links to other  HTML pages  46% have more  than 10 links  76% have more than  10 links  40% have more  than 5 links  0.8% have more  than 5 links  Links to  images,  movies 36% have 11 to 20  links  0.2% have 11 to 20  links  36% have less than  40 words  17% have less than  40 words  Passage  Words (not  used for  links) 28% have more  than 200 words  50% have more than  200 words  75% have more  than 10% of their  words highlighted  54% have more than  10% of their words  highlighted  Highlighted  Words  21% have all their  words highlighted  9.7% have all their  words highlighted  Table 1: Structural Differences in Pornographic and  Non-pornographic web pages  In both categories, Title was specified in 98% of the  web pages, with 97% having text in the Body. Only 58%  of non-pornographic web pages had usable Meta  information, keywords or descriptions, with slightly less  for pornographic web pages at 52%.

1.2. Textual Modelling  The research analysed the terms appearing within  the following HTML page sections and tags separately  [6], to determine whether the characteristics of each  section and their common usage could be used in the  simple identification of pornographic web pages.

? Title: Tokens that were tagged within  <TITLE> and </TITLE> in the <HEAD> section  ? Meta: Tokens that were tagged within  <META> and </META> as keywords and  descriptions, as follows:  o <META NAME="keywords"  CONTENT="sex, cum, sluts, free pics,  smut, porno, porn, anal, oral, pamela,  asia, asians">  ? Body: All tokens seen on the web page  including ?alternate text? of <IMG> tags (the  text value of the ?alt? attribute displays in the  box where the image should be located, if the  browser cannot find the image or if it isn?t set to  display images).

To reduce the number of identical tokens, and to  improve the accuracy of the analysis, abbreviations, short  forms and morphological variants of tokens [7] that had  equivalent semantic interpretations were grouped.

1.3. Term Variation  Terms found in non-pornographic web pages were  found to be more diverse than pornographic pages. From  the 1,232 pornographic web pages in the sample, about  16,000 different terms were identified, whereas around  145,000 different terms, some nine times more than the  pornographic category, were found in the 6,967 non-  pornographic web pages sampled. Among these terms,  about 4,000 appeared in both the pornographic and non-  pornographic web pages.

3. Statistical Analysis  Through the textual analysis of terms occurring in  both categories, significant differences in term usage in  the two categories were identified (Table 2- Table 5).

Table 2 shows the terms that appeared only in the  pornographic web pages sampled, but not in the non-  pornographic web pages.

Term Occurrence  Cumshot 136  Shemale 108  Upskirt 97  Gangbang 87  Bdsm 63  Table 2: Terms appearing only in the training  corpus of pornography  These terms appear to be ?created? pornographic  terms (e.g., ?cumshot?) or acronyms (e.g., ?BDSM?).

Since they only appear in pornographic web pages, they  might be useful in blocking filters using single keywords.

Table 3 shows terms that appeared in both the  pornographic and non-pornographic corpora, having a  much higher relative occurrence in the former.

For example, a bird watching page about  the ?blue tit? might be blocked by using a simple based  on the term ?tit?.

There was also a set of commonly used non-  pornographic terms that frequently appeared in sexually  explicit web pages, as shown in Table 4. To some extent,  terms like ?girl? and ?movie? have been appropriated by  the porn industry to indicate something other than their  innocent referents.

There were few occurrences of the term ?article?,  for example, in what is primarily a visual medium.

In fact, the  terms used in the Title section were found to be more  diverse than the other sections.

As only about 55% of the web pages sampled had  usable Meta information, and the term frequency in the  Title section did not converge as well as that in the Body  section, identifying pornographic web pages using the  Body section appears to be the most reliable approach.

4. Association Rules  The fact that some terms within pornographic pages  can be distinguished from non-pornographic pages is not  surprising, given that pornographic web sites rely on web  spiders to locate and index their contents. Given the  observed differences in the terms found in the two  categories in the current sample, we wondered whether a  simple approach of associating the above terms with the  pornographic category would be effective in predicting  pornographic web page category membership. To answer  the question, the Support, Confidence and Lift Measures  using Body terms with simple association rules [9, 10]  were tabulated as shown in Table 7. Applying the  association rule to terms appearing only in pornographic  web pages resulted in a Confidence of 100%, and a Lift of  6.65, but the Support was only around 1%. Thus, using  these terms to identify pornographic web pages can cover     only a small population, even though we might achieve a  zero false positive rate.

The terms ?pussy?  and ?tit? had Confidence around 98%, with Support close  to 3%. While these terms may be better suited to  identifying pornographic web pages than those in Table 7,  their Support is still low, given that the Support for  pornographic web pages in the corpus was around 15%.

To achieve a better result, we would need to identify  terms that have both high Support and Confidence.

However, all terms that had Confidence higher than 90%  in Table 7 had Support lower than 5%, and those that had  Support closer to 10% had Confidence lower than 50%.

Only the terms ?picture?, ?amateur?, ?sex? and ?girl? had  a better balance between the two, and were thus the best  choice for use in a simple search process for blocking, if  such an approach was to be used.

The search for keywords to identify pornographic web  pages is a straightforward process, but the results in Table  7 and Table 8 clearly shows the deficiency of using  individual terms to identify pornographic web pages.

Some terms had a high Confidence level, but the overall  accuracy was low due to the low Support and coverage.

Intuitively, terms appearing more often in  pornographic web pages should be used to separate them  from others, and using terms that rarely appeared in the  category, but more often in the non-pornographic  category, could actually supplement the final result by  excluding the non-pornographic cases. Thus, if a term in  Table 5 was found, then the web page should be  considered non-pornographic.

To support this view, the Support and Confidence  results shown in Table 9 indicate that using the term  ?about? can identify non-pornographic pages with  Confidence of around 98.31%, and Support close to 50%.

The model  also provides clues about which terms can be used to  identify pornographic web pages when using simple  keyword searches. However, the Support and Confidence  figures indicate that the approach of using individual  terms in their own right to identify pornographic web  pages does not give a very satisfactory result. This is  clearly one reason why commercial pornography filtering  products are generally not highly accurate [11].

5. Bayesian Classification     Given that simple association rules were not suitable  as predictors of category membership for pornographic  web pages, we developed a more sophisticated classifier,  using Bayes? Rule [12], which uses the term distribution  of a representative number of terms, found in both  pornographic and non-pornographic web pages, to  determine the likelihood that an unseen web page is  pornographic or not.

To use Bayes? rule, an unclassified document D was  represented by a term vector consisting of n terms, D =  (t1, ?. tn). The conditional probabilities of an unknown  document D being in class Ci for both pornographic and  non-pornographic categories were calculated, and the  document was then assigned to the class with a higher  conditional probability.

According to the Na?ve Bayes? rule, the probability  that a document belongs to a given class is a function of  the observed frequency with which terms occurring in that  document also occur in other documents known to be  representative members of that class, using the formula:  )(  )(*)|(  )|(  Dp  CpCtp  DCp  nj  j  iij  i  ? =  = =  The occurrence obtained from the analysis of the  corpus of 8,199 web pages described in the previous  sections was converted to term frequencies.

5.1. Test Corpus  The algorithm was evaluated using a testing corpus of  3,411 web pages, with 258 web pages being pornographic  and 3,153 web pages being non-pornographic. The test  and training sets were drawn from independent groups of  websites to eliminate any testing bias, and this  preliminary testing set of pornographic pages is relatively  small. Among them, 294 were close positive cases, as  shown in Table 10.

Results  Table 11 shows that applying Bayes? Rule to the three  sections (Title, Meta and Body) all resulted in an accuracy  rate higher than 95%, with the highest of 98.4% achieved  by the Body section. The main reason for Title?s lower  score was that titles of web pages are usually shorter, with  many containing less than 10 terms. Thus, the  improvement over the use of a single term search based  on an association rule is not significant. In addition, a  term that normally appears more often in the category  other than the one it should be in can bias the  classification result significantly. The low accuracy rate  of the Meta section is again due to the low percentage of  web pages containing Meta information. There were nine  True Negative cases for the Meta section, but the figure  used in calculating the accuracy rate was much higher, as     those pornographic cases without keywords were  considered non-pornographic. The results with respect to  the total number of test cases were calculated using the  number of pornographic and non-pornographic cases in  the test corpus. A web page not identified as pornographic  was treated as non-pornographic.

Instead, it compares the unknown document  with a ?template? made up of many terms. This works for  almost all web pages. In contrast, as shown in the  previous section, individual terms normally receive  support lower than 50%.

The study has also tested variations which resulting in  either a lower false positive or true negative rate. The first  variation combined the results of the three sections (Title,  Meta and Body) to derive the final classification (shown  as ?All? in Table 12). The following algorithm was used  to determine the combined results of these sections: (a) a  web page was considered as pornographic when any of  the section suggested it was; and (b) when no section  suggested a web page was pornographic, the web page  was considered non-pornographic.

The second variation was based on weighting the  Highlighted and Linked terms in the Body section, by  multiplying their occurrence percentages twice (shown as  ?BHL? in Table 12), using the following formula:  )|(*)|(*)|(  "   '   i  nh  h hi  mk  k  i  nj  j  j CtpCtpCtp k ??? =  =  =  =  =  =  where tj are terms occurring in the Body section, the t?k are  terms that are highlighted, and the t??h are terms that form  part of a link.

This variation may be suitable  for environments where users are mainly adults, and more  likely to access close positive cases.

The variation combining the result of the three sections  gives the lowest True Negative rate, as any trace that a  web page is pornographic is captured. The False Positive  rate is therefore the highest. This variation is suitable for  environments like schools, where a lower number of True  Negatives is more desirable, and a comparatively higher  False Positive may not cause many objections.

The variation ?BHL?, where highlighted and linked  terms in the Body were given heavier weights, yields the  highest accuracy rate of 99.1%. It also has a lower True  Negative when compared with that achieved originally by  the Body section. Although the False Positive rate is  higher, these instances occurred mainly in the close  positive cases. This variation may be the best choice in  general, as it neither results in a high True Negative, nor a  high False Positive rate.

6. Conclusion  The results of the study show that there are many  significant structural and statistical differences between  pornographic and non-pornographic web pages that could  be exploited to build accurate content filters. The  variations of Bayes? rule introduced here provide a solid  basis for the building of more personalised filtering and  structuring of WWW content, to suit each user?s needs.

The Bayes? classifier had better performance than that of  simple association rules based on single terms, both in  terms of accuracy and support. Several variations to test  the adaptiveness of the classifiers to environments, where  a lower False Positive or True Negative rate was more  desirable, were also carried out, with encouraging results.

Overall, the study found that variations of the Bayes?  rule can be easily applied to the domain of pornographic  web page classification. However, the building of the  training corpora obviously affects the final result, and a  considerable amount of time and manual effort was  required for even the relatively small corpora collated for  this study. In the longer term, the total effort should still  be less than that required to maintain the lists of blocking  web sites, used by many commercial filtering systems,  based on the ?black list? approach.

While the focus of the current study is in web page  personalisation vis-?-vis pornography, the techniques  utilised are clearly generalisable to other content  categories, given the high test classification accuracy of  the variations on Bayes? rule. In addition, the application  of unsupervised classification techniques (such as cluster  analysis, frequently used in related tasks [13]) to develop  a better descriptive model may further enhance the  predictive power of the current classifier. Further  comparisons between other classification methods, such  as support vector machines [14] and various types of  machine learning [15], are being actively investigated.

Aside from the feature extraction and pattern  recognition issues specific to text remains the major  problem of how to integrate text based pornographic page  identification algorithms with video and image-based  systems. This is a significant requirement, since the target  material that we are seeking to block is more likely to be  video and images rather than text ? the text simply  provides the set of types that we use to identify a page as  pornographic by inference.

Current research [11] indicates that ?flesh detectors?  for images have somewhat less than 100% accuracy ?  even if skin tones can be segmented from clothing in  colour [16], a deeper semantic issue remains: how do we  distinguish between an identified image of a breast that is  part of a presentation on breast cancer, as opposed to a  pornographic image? Similar issues exist for video, where  there are few standards for marking up streaming data  with text augmentation [17].

Given that entry pages into pornographic sites consist  mainly of text, but that actual presentation of  pornographic data is video or images, feature extraction  techniques need to be integrated with a common  classification system that can make the most informed  choice in a given context. For example, if an image is  detected as having a high proportion of skin, then the  features of any associated web pages need to extracted  and used in the classification procedure. Integrated  multimodal classification remains the major challenge to  filtering pornography, given the accuracy of text-only  methods reported in this paper ? integration of image  content, video and audio classification remain challenges.
