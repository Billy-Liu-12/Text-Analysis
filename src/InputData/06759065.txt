Introduction to HICCS-47 Business Analytics, Business Intelligence and Big Data Minitrack   Olivera Marjanovic  University of Sydney olivera.marjanovic@  sydney.edu.au  Thilini Ariyachandra Xavier University  ariyachandrat@xavier.edu   Barbara Dinter University of St. Gallen  barbara.dinter@unisg.ch     The provision of the right data with appropriate quality according to the needs of decision makers or automated processes is crucial for successful operations of companies and government agencies.

Management Information Systems, Decision Support Systems, Executive Information Systems, interactive online analysis (OLAP), data mining, dashboards and recently predictive analytics are examples for the historic advancement of business analytics/business intelligence concepts for the front-end, while databases, data warehousing and recently ?big data? are examples for the development of the underlying technical infrastructure concepts. The smart combination of task-oriented front end innovations and technology-driven infrastructure innovations allow for enhanced decision speed, more efficient extracting, cleaning, and aggregating data from source systems, maintaining and analyzing larger data sets, and demand-oriented access to data.

From an information systems perspective, business analytics (BA), business intelligence (BI) and ?big data? constitute a dynamic, fascinating and highly relevant field of research. This includes managerial considerations (BI/BA strategy, BI/BA organization and governance, BI/BA value, data quality management, etc.), process-centric business intelligence, and inter-organizational aspects. As organizations are learning how to leverage ?big data? (including social media data, mobile data, web data and network data) new innovative applications are expected to emerge, and with them new research challenges, yet to be discovered.

This year?s minitrack received eleven submissions from which four were accepted (36%).

? Ebner, Buhnen and Urbach aim to identify different big data strategies a company may implement and provide a set of organizational contingency factors that influence strategy choice.

They review existing literature in the fields of big data analytics, data warehousing and business  intelligence and synthesize the main findings into a contingency matrix that may support practitioners in choosing a suitable big data approach.

? Kaufmann and Chamoni use a literature review to provide a comprehensive overview of the current understanding and applications of Collaborative Business Intelligence (CBI). They identify three main areas of the CBI research: internal communication, data storage with (external) partners and data analysis with partners.

? Drawing upon relevant theories and adoption literature Yoon, Ghosh and Jeong investigate the main factors that affect an individual?s decision to adopt BI applications. They identify four categories of individual factors: technology, motivation, social influence and social constraints, all validated using a pilot study, also described in the paper.

? Bekmamedova and Shanks present a theoretical framework that explains how organizations create value with Social Media Analytics (SMA). The authors use the framework as a lens for a case study involving a large financial institution that deployed SMA as a critical component of a major and highly successful marketing campaign.

We hope that you will find this year?s selection of papers interesting and relevant.
