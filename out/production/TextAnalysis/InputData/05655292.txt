Prediction of E-shoppers Behavior Changes Based on Purchase Sequences

Abstractwith the rapid development of online shopping, on-line  one-to-one marketing becomes a great assistance to e-shoppers. One  of the most important marketing resources is the prior daily  transaction records in the database. In this study, the paper  propose  a new methodology for predict e-shoppers purchase behavior that  uses e-shoppers purchase sequences. First, transaction clustering is  conducted, then it is made that detecting the evolving e-shopper  purchase sequences as time passes, and the e-shoppers behaviors,  which are derived from a change in the cluster number of each  e-shopper, are kept in the purchase sequence database. Finally,  sequential purchase patterns over user-specified minimum support  and confidence are extracted by using the association rule. The  sequential purchase patterns are then stored in the association rule  database. The better result is achieved by applying the new  methodogy to a given example for e-shoppers.

I.  INTRODUCTION  The development of the Internet has caused a new wave of  business revolutions. Most of the Electronic Commerce  businesses endeavor to survive and become leaders in the  frontier of the new wave. The major key factors [1] of success  include learning e-shoppers purchase behavior, developing  marketing strategies to create new consuming markets, and  discovering latent loyal e-shoppers etc. Therefore, support of  domain expertise to make better decisions and new IT  techniques to promote EC marketing are essential.

E-retailing companies operate purchase databases in a  longitudinal way, such that all transactions are stored in  chronological order[2]. A record-of-transaction database  typically contains the transaction date and the products bought  in the course of a given transaction. Usually, each record also  contains a e-shopper ID, particularly when the purchase was  made using a credit card or a frequent-buyer card. Therefore,  the purchasing sequence of a e-shopper in the database who    has made repeat purchases can easily be determined [3-5]. This  purchase sequence provides a description of the changes in a  e-shoppers preferences over time.

So far, several methods have been proposed for predicting  e-shoppers behavior. Statistical methods, such as regression  model and ARMA [6], have been the candidates for decision  makers. However, these methods are only efficient for data,  which are seasonal or cyclical. Association rules extraction  can discover potentially significant patterns and rules  underlying the database. The patterns and rules are mostly the  habits of purchasing and other e-shoppers' behavior. However,  there are many shortcomings [7-8] for the algorithms in the  efficiency. In the existing algorithms for discovering the  association rules, the support is unique throughout the whole  database [9], and they assume that each data included in the  database occurs in a similar frequency [10]. However,  e-shoppers in e-retailing business are not static, and their  buying behavior changes over time [11]. Therefore, association  rules extraction is not suitable for predicting the changes of  e-shoppers purchase behavior for only mining the transaction  data during a certain period.

Though artificial neural networks which are better than  the conventional statistical methods [12] have been recently  employed, the problem still arises [13]. Most ANN models use  a multiplayer network with one or more hidden layers. The  parameters of the model such as the choice of input nodes,  number of hidden layers, number of hidden nodes (in each  hidden layer), and the form of transfer functions, are  dependent problem and often require trial and error to find the  best model for a particular application [14-15].

Purchase sequences can reveals the changes of  e-shoppers preferences over time. However, in the present  domain of knowledge, there has been little study of mining  the e-shoppers behavior based on purchase sequences. In this  study, for predicting e-shoppers behavior changes, we  propose a new methodology that considers the way in which a  e-shoppers purchase sequence evolves over time.

In the following sections, literature review is briefly  introduced in Section 1. In section 2, we elaborate the idea of  the proposed methodology. In section 3, we present the  algorithms for predicting e-shoppers purchase behavior. In  section 4, an illustrative example is given to illustrate how to    utilize the method. Finally, discussions and conclusions are  presented in Section 5.



II.  DESCRIBING METHODOLOGY  To predict e-shoppers purchase behavior changes, an  organizations management first identifies target e-shoppers  who share similar preferences for products and looks for those  products that target e-shoppers are most likely to purchase.

The purchase transaction records of e-shopper are used to  build e-shoppers profile describing his or her likes and  dislikes. A set of e-shoppers known as neighbors who have  exhibited similar behavior in the past, can be found through  calculating the correlations among e-shoppers. A   978-0-7695-4225-6/10 $26.00  2010 IEEE  DOI 10.1109/AICI.2010.271   neighborhood size of e-shoppers is formed according to the  degree of similarity between each of the neighbors and a  target e-shopper. Once a neighborhood is formed for a target  e-shopper, a set of the products that the target e-shopper is  most likely to purchase is determined by searching for  products that the neighbors have purchased and that the target  e-shopper has not yet purchased. To illustrate the method  mentioned above, let us consider the following example.

Table 1 presents typical transaction records for an e-retailing  company and the e-shopper profile is provided in Table 2.

TABLE I. TRANSACTION RECORDS  E-shopper ID transaction time products bought           :     May    June  July  May  June  July  May  June  July  :  July  May  June           :              :     Can  Candy  Milk  Can    Bread  Candy  Candy  Can  Milk  :  Milk  Can  Candy  TABLE II. E-SHOPPER PROFILE  CID Candy Can Milk Bread Biscuit     :                                           This example determines products that target e-shopper  ID011 is likely to buy, using transaction records for  e-shoppers CID006 through CID016. Target e-shoppers  purchase behavior can be predicted according to the  correlation of preferences between the target e-shopper and  the other e-shoppers. All of the four e-shoppers, CID016,  CID006, CID007 and CID008, commonly bought Candy  and Can. The similarities between CID016 and the other  three e-shoppers are equivalent. The Pearson correlation  coefficient is 0.67. Therefore, it is sure that CID006, CID007  and CID008 are the nearest neighbors and have the same  preferences as the target e-shopper.

According to Table 1, a e-shopper profile is rearranged  with regard to each e-shoppers transaction time. The result is  shown in table 3. From table 3, it can be seen that the  purchase sequence of the target e-shopper CID016 occurred in  the order of Candy, followed by Can Products. Similarly, the  purchase sequences of CID006, CID007 and CID008 were  Candy?Can?Milk, Candy?Can?Bread, Can?Candy?Milk,  respectively. Assume now that the neighbors of the target  e-shopper are determined based on the purchase sequence of  each e-shopper. E-shoppers who have purchase sequences  similar to that of CID016 include CID 006 and CID007. The  purchase sequences of CID016 and CID006 are exactly same,  as both bought the same products during the same month;  therefore, the nearest neighbor of the target e-shopper CID016  is CID006. The next nearest neighbor is CID007. Therefore,  the products which CID016 is likely to buy are Dresses, and  Shoes. As mentioned above, when the past purchase  sequences of each e-shopper are available, this knowledge can  be used to predict e-shoppers purchase behavior.

However, if a e-shopper profile rearranged by time is  applied  directly, this application results in a significant  problem, namely, the sparsity problem. Rearrangement of an  input matrix by time results in an increased time dimension,  as compared to that of a typical e-shopper profile. In this    study, a clustering and SOM technique is employed. All the  transactions of e-shoppers may be allocated to a certain  cluster and a cluster number imposed. The change in the  cluster number resulting from each transaction determines a  e-shopper purchase sequence. By observing changes in the  cluster number of each e-shopper over time, a buying  sequence can be built for each e-shopper. These buying  sequences are potentially capable of predicting the future  purchases of a target e-shoppe.

For solving the above problem, the following measures  are taken. First, transaction clustering is conducted, so that all  the transactions of e-shoppers are clustered. The SOM  technique is used to cluster target e-shoppers transactions.

Then it is necessary to detect the evolving e-shopper purchase  sequences as time passes. These e-shopper behaviors, which  are derived from a change in the cluster number of each  e-shopper, are kept in the purchase sequence database. Finally,  sequential purchase patterns over user-specified minimum  support and confidence are extracted by using the association  rule. The sequential purchase patterns are then stored in the  association rule database.

Although SOM technique can obtains transaction clusters,  SOM clustering technique often breaks down when handling  very high-dimensional data. So it is proposed that using  product classes represents the hierarchical relationships  among products. The method can make an effective  dimensionality reduction while improving clustering results.

Assume that a product class set P  is classified into n  different subclasses, and that each subclass consists of  subclasses at a lower level, or eventual leaf products, as  follows:  { }PPPPP nn ,, 121 ?= "                          (1)  Suppose that C is the set of the transactions of m  e-shoppers during s periods before timeT . More specifically,  letC be composed as follows:  { }CCC kTmkTkTC ???= ,,2,1 ,, "                   (2)  ,11,0 ?= sk "  2?s  WhereC kTj ?, ?C  is a non-empty subset of products.

Each C kTj ?,  represents the product class or classes from  which e-shopper j purchased products at time kT ? .

EveryC kTj ?,  is transformed into an input matrix composed  of a bit vector, and the matrix to be transformed is used in the  transaction clustering. The time-ordered vectors for a  particular e-shopper represent the purchasing history of the    e-shopper; this input matrix can be thought of as the dynamic  profile of the e-shopper. A dynamic e-shopper profile is  defined as follows:  Let C  _  be a dynamic e-shopper profile. Then, C  _  is  defined by the following matrix for n product classes and  m e-shoppers over the course of s periods.

( )PPPC CnCCkTj kTjkTjkTj ???=? ,,, ,, 21_, "              (3)  mj "2,1=  ,11,0 ?= sk " 2?s  Where                         1 if Pi?C kTj ?,      All the transactions of e-shoppers in the training e-shopper  purchase database are transformed into dynamic e-shopper  profiles based on their prior purchase behaviors. Then we use  the SOM clustering technique to assign each transaction to a  group. This transaction clustering facilitates the discovery of  the dynamic cluster sequence of e-shopper.

The transaction clustering results in the following set of q  clusters.

{ }DDDD q"21 ,=                             (4)  Where each Di is a subset of C  _  the given in (3).

A rearrangement of these clusters by  e-shopper  and by  time  period is necessary for the identification of the  dynamic behavior of each e-shopper. It is possible to learn the  cluster sequence of a e-shopper by identifying the cluster to  which each transaction of the e-shopper belongs, during each  time period. To formalize this concept, we use the following  terminology:  Let BP j be the behavior pattern of e-shopper j . Then, the  behavior pattern BPi is identical to the changes in the cluster  number of e-shopper j during s periods and is defined as  follows:  ( )DDDBP TjTjsTjj ,1,1, ,,, ?+?= " mj ",2,1=      (5)  Where D kTj ?, ?D ,11,0 ?= sk "  2?s  The  process  of searching for  a behavior path can    be simply conducted through transaction clustering. All  e-shoppers  have  a behavior path based on their prior  transactions. The association rule technique is well suited for  determining the most frequent pattern with confidence, since  it provides automatic filtering capabilities. To discover the  behavior path of a target e-shopper at time T based on his/her  past behavior, the input data should be divided into a  conditional part and a consequential part. Association rules  are descriptive patterns of the form X?Y, where X and Y are  statements regarding the values of attributes of an instance in  a database. X is termed the left-hand-side, and is the  conditional part of an association rule. Meanwhile, Y is called  the right-hand-side, and is the consequent part. The  conditional part is composed of the  left-hand-side ( )DDD TjTjsTj ,1,1, ,,, ?+? " , and D Tj,   is  assigned to the consequential part.

R j represents the association rule about the user specified  minimum support and confidence in the following form:  R j : ( ) DDD TjTjsTj ,1,1, ,, ??+? "                 (6)  A rule R j  indicates that, if the path of a e-shopper is  DD TjsTj 1,1, , ?+? " , then the behavior cluster for that  e-shopper is D Tj, at timeT .

It is necessary to know the degree to which the behavior  path of a target e-shopper during 1?s periods beforeT  is  similar to the association rule. The cluster path of a target  e-shopper, transformed via the SOM, is compared with the  association rules derived from other e-shoppers paths, and  then the best-matching path is determined. Execution of this  0 if Otherwise  =  ?

?

C kTj,   process requires new measures for calculating the degree of  correspondence between the association rules and the  behavior path of a target e-shopper. This similarity measure is  defined as follows.

??

Si kTj,  0 otherwise  mj "2,1=  ,11,0 ?= sk " 2?s  ni "2,1=  The above definition indicates that, if the behavior path of  a target e-shopper i is equal to the conditional part of  association rule j in the same period, then S j kTi ?,  is equal to  one, otherwise is equal to zero. However, even if the  similarity measure is high, a choice of the association rule  suited to the prediction of the cluster of a target e-shopper at  timeT is difficult, since such a rule is not general, given that  the support and confidence of the association rule may be  remarkably low. Therefore, to assure a good fit between the  behavior path of a target e-shopper and the conditional part of  the association rule, it is necessary to measure fitness. Fitness  is defined as follows:  Suppose FDij be a degree of the goodness-of-fit between  the behavior path i and the association rule j . Then, FDij is  defined as follows  ConfidenceSupportSDFD jjjiij = ,             (8)  Using the above definition, we can determine the cluster  of a target e-shopper at timeT is a consequential part R Tj, of  the association rule j with maximum FDij .



IV.  ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE  In this paper, we use Table 3 as example given to illustrate  proposed method. The set of product classes given in Table 3  is P={Candy, Can, Milk, Bread, Biscuit}. The transactions of  e-shopper CID006 are  =C June,006 {Candy}, =C May,006 {Can}, =C July,006 {Milk}.

Therefore, the dynamic purchase profile of  CID006 buying the set of products {Candy, Can, Milk,  Bread, Biscuit} from May to July may be represented  as { }0,0,0,0,1,006  _  =C June , { }0,0,0,1,0,006  _  =C May and  { }0,0,1,0,0,006  _  =C July . CID016 and CID006 are exactly same,  as both bought the same products during the same month.

Therefore, similarly, the transactions of target e-shopper  CID016 are =C June,016 {Candy} and =C May,016 {Can}.

The dynamic purchase profile of  CID016 buying the products may be represented as  { }0,0,0,0,1,016  _  =C June , { }0,0,0,1,0,016  _  =C May .

TABLE IV. BEHAVIOR PATH OF E-SHOPPER  CID 1+? sT  1?T  T     :       :  -      :  -        :      Suppose 3=s , according to formula (5), the behavior path  of CID006, BP006  is{ }9,3,10 , as shown in table 4,  which  indicates  that  e-shopper  CID006 belonged to the tenth  cluster in May and moved into the third cluster in June,  thereafter reaching the ninth cluster in July.

According to formula (6), the association rules are derived  from e-shoppers path with regard to a minimum support of  0.1 and a minimum confidence of 0.5. The association rules  are as shown in table 5. The similarities  between the path of  e-shopper CID016  and the derived rules are 22016 =SD and  11016 =SD . Therefore, e-shopper CID016 belongs to the ninth  cluster at timeT , since the fitness between CID016 and the  rules are =FD2016 0.2 and =FD   016 0.2001. Therefore, we  predict that the products which e-shopper CID016 is likely to  buy are Bread, and Biscuit.

TABLE V. THE DERIVED ASSOCIATE RULES  Rule 1+? sT  1?T  T  Support Confidence     :         -          -          0.3  0.1  0.1  0.2  0.1  0.1  1.0  1.0  1.0  0.5  1.0  1.0

V. CONCLUSION  The preferences of e-shopper change over time. In this  study, we describe a new approach for mining the changes of  e-shopper  purchase behavior over time and discuss solutions  to several problems. For predicting e-shoppers purchase  behavior, the following concepts are proposed: BP j ,  SDij and FDij . The SOM technique is used to detect the  evolving e-shopper purchase sequences as time passes. The  purchase sequences are derived from the changes in the  cluster number of e-shopper. The sequential purchase patterns  over user-specified minimum support and confidence are  extracted by using the association rule. Then the sequential  purchase patterns are stored in the rule database.

Finally, we give the example to elaborate the new  methodology. The research presented in this paper makes a   contribution to mining  e-shoppers purchase behavior  basing on transaction data. E-retailer may be able to perform  effective  one-to-one marketing campaigns by providing  individual target e-shoppers with personalized Product basing  on using purchase sequences.

In the future, some possible extensions to this work are as    follows. From the results of this study, we know which  products target e-shoppers are likely to buy, but we have not  yet explored the times at which these purchases are likely to  occur. Further research analyzing e-shoppers past purchasing  patterns should likewise enable prediction of the most  appropriate times. Furthermore, one interesting research  extension would be the setting up of a real marketing  campaign, in which e-shoppers would be targeted using this  methodology, which could then be evaluated with regard to its  performance.
