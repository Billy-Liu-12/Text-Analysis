Generalized Association Rule Base Mining and Its Algorithm

Abstract Association rule mining is one of the most important research areas in data mining. Yet there exist two big problems in process of acquiring rule by traditional mining algorithms, i.e., the quantity and the quality of rule. Presently there are many methods focus on resolving these two problems. Although these methods can reduce the amount of rules derived to some extent, but the total number is too big as ever. In this paper, we first propose the notations of upper closed itemset and generalized association rule base, and obtain a generalized association rule base of a database, which not only contains the whole information of all association rules, but also has conform structure that is convenient for practical applications. Also, We propose a mining algorithm of generalized association rule base. From OUT propositions and example, the algorithm is shown valid and can efficiently solve the problem of quantity of rule.

I. Introduction Association rule mining is one of the most important  research areas in data minin , to which many researchers have paid their  attention"^ 31. Yet there exist two big problems in process of acquiring rule by traditional mining algorithms, i.e., the quantity and the quality of rule. Namely, too many rules obtained and not all of those rules are interesting. Presently there are many methods focus on resolving these two problems. Some researchers proposed the methods for reducing the amount of rules by deleting or combining derived rules.

For instance, the idea of reducing overabundant rules by sttuctured rule and summarizing related rule by clustering was proposed in [5].  The method of GSE-pattern to organize, generalize, and represent the rule mined was presented in [13]. Other researchers presented the methods of mining association rule based on constraints, which can reduce amount of rules by applying some special consuaints provided by users to the mining process, such as the methods in [14-191.

The primary methods to improve quality of rule is to define a measure of interest and apply it to measure the  B  ~~  - l h i s  work was suppoad by the National Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under the gant No.60074014.

surprisingness(unexpectedness), novelty, usefulness of a pattern'*'. By the measure of interest, it is possible to sort the obtained rules and provide the assured high quality rules to the policymaker, such as the method proposed in 16, 7, 121.

Moreover, there are many other methods for reducing Overabundant rules and increasing the quality of the rules, such as mining multiple-level association rules in [41, mining association rules with multiple minimum supports in [20], mining passociation rule in [9-111 and the like.

In this paper, we aim at the problem of quantity of rule.

Although the above methods can reduce the amount of rules derived to some extent, the total number is too big as ever. In th following, we present a generalized association rule and its mining algorithm, which can solve this problem efficiently  11. Preliminaries Definition 1'" Let k { i &  ..., imJ be a set of m  different items. An association rule is an implication of the form X a Y ,  where @ X q ,  @Yd,  and,XnY=@.

Definition 2'" Let X be an itemset. I f s  percents of the transactions containing X in the transaction database, then the supporl of X, denoted as supp(X), is s.

Definition 3''" An itemset X is closed if there exists no itemset Y so that Y is a proper superset of X and every transaction containing X also contains Y.

Definition 4 A closed rule i s  an implication expression of the form X a Y ,  where #Xd, Y=A and X is a closed itemset.

Definition 5 Association rule and closed rule are all called generalized association rule.

Definition 6 An upper closed set of an itemset X, denoted asX-(called as upper closed itemset), is the smallest closed itemset containing it.

From Definition 6, it is obviously that the following propositions hold.

Proposition 1 Let X be an itemset, then  suPP(x)=suPP( x - ) Proposition 2 If X is a closed itemset, then  X - = X Proposition 3 The upper closed set of an itemset X is  .

unique.

mailto:sohu.com mailto:mi99032@sina.com   Proof ,If X is a closed itemset, then the conclusion holds by Proposition 2. If Xis  not a closed itemset and its upper closed set is not unique, then there exist two different upper closed itemsets YI, Y2 of X. By Definition 6 and Proposition 1, we get  YtXX, YQX, ~ ~ P P ( x ) = s ~ p P ( y l ) ~ supp(x)=supp(~2).

that is to say, if a transaction contains X, then it must contain Yl and if a transaction contains X, then it must contain Y2. Therefore, if a transaction contains Yl, then it must contain Y2. Since Yl and Y2 are different, that we have  YIUY23Yl, , .  . .

s ~ P P ~ ~ l ~ Y 2 ~ = s u p P ~ ~ l ~ .

By Definition 3, Yl is not a closed itemset, i.e., Yl is not a upper closed itemset. This is a'conb-adiction with that Y, is a upper closed itemset.

Proposition 4 Let X, Y be two itemsets. Then  Proof By definitions of support and. upper closed  Proposition 5 The rule set { r l r :x  3 Y be a generalized association rule, X, x U Y closed itemsett not only keeps the information of all association rules, but also has no redundant rule. That keeping information has two meanings: ( I )  it can deduce.aU association rules of the database; (2) it can keep bformation in the wurse of deducing, i.e., it does not change the support and confidence of rule in .the deductive course. That no redundant rule means no rule can be obtained by adding or deleting item of antecedent (or consequent) to another rule in this:%se.

Proof By Proposition 1-4, it is trivial.

Remark 1 This conclusion is of great significance in  association rule hining problem. Not only does the set of rules contain all information of association rules, but also rules in it are conform, i.e., antecedent of ?le and conjunction of antecedent and consequent areboth closed itemset which make it very useful in practical application such as visualization in data mining process. '  Definition 7 We call the rule set { r/r :x 2 Y be a generalized association rule, X, X U Y closed itemsett as generalized association rule base of the database.

Therefore, all association rules of the database c h  be obtained provided we can get the generalized association rule base. Because the amount of closed itemsets is far Iewthan that ofitemsets'?l-2?', not only can we reduce the amount of rules as many as possible but also the rules in the base will not be reduced otherwise information will be lost.

In the following, we give the concrete mining algorithm of generalized association rule base.

Algorithm:(Mining algorithm of generalized  Input: Database D, the least support tninsupp, and the  Output: Generalized association rule base Method:  association rule base)  least confidence rninconf  I 1) Based on mining a1 orithm of frequent closed itemset (e.g., cIose'218 CLOSET[22]', c m ' 2 3 ' ) , get the frequent closed itemset FCI and number it according to cardinal number in increasing order and lexicographic order.

Dividing FCI into two parts: FCII (all itemsets with cardinal number 1) and FCI, (all itemsets with cardinal number greater than I).

3) Recursively mining rule. Call GenRule(FC/~, FCIz, ' 0 .  Where parameters in subroutine GenRule(F~, F2, RuleBaseSet) are: + FI-frequent closed itemset in the front part  of FCI; t F2-frequent closed itemset in FCI Wl; + RuleBaseSet-obtained rules in generalized  association rule base; The concrete process as follows:  (a) If F2=& then stop; (b) Select the first element A from F2; (c) For all subset B of A in 4: derive the rule  2)  r:BaA\B (support=supp(B), Confidencesupp(A)lsupp(B))  If the confidence of the rule r is greater than minconf, then add it in RuleBaseSet; (d) Derive rule  r:A=@ (support=supp(A), Confidence=l))  (e) Adding r in RuleBaseSet; (f) Deleting A from Fz; (g) Adding A in FI; (h) Recursively call GenRule(F,, Fz,  Prop&ition 6 From the set of all frequent closed itemset, we can obtain the above generalized association rule base.

Proof Since all applicable combination of frequent closed itemsets can be reached by $e algorithm, the conclusion holds.

Remark 2 By.proposition 6, the above algorithm is valid.

Example 1 Suppose a tr&saction database is shown as Table 1.

Table I: Transaction Databass  . .

b, c, e  a, b, c, e  -920    50 8 , C  The least support and the least confidence are 0, and all teauent closed itemset in the database are obtained as  akeinantecedenr  ~ ~~~~  follows (according to cardinal number in increasing order and lexicographic order): ( b 3 ) ,  {c:4), (ac:3}, (bf.1).

(acd:l), (bce:2), (abce:l), where ( t : s )  means itemset t occurring s times in the database.

Then FCII={{b3),(c:4}), FCIp({ac:3), ( b f l ) , [acd:l], (bce:2), (abce:l)), and the concrete process of GenRule(F,, F2, RuleBaseSet) is shown as follows:  1) Let FI=FCIt, F2=FC12, Rulebaseset=& 2) Select the first element (ac:3} in FC12; 3) For any subset of (ac:3) in F, (bere only one, i.e.,  [c:4}), derive rule r: caa(support=4/5, confidence=3/4), shortly for r:c=xi(4/5,3/4).

Because the confidence of the rule r:c=m(4/5,3/4) is greater than minconf, we add it in the Rulebaseset. Now, RulebaseSet=( c=a(4/5,3/4)); Derive the rule rac=>@3/5,1) and add it in the Rulebaseset. Now, Rulebaseset=( c=a(4/5,3/4), ac34(3/5,1));  5 )  Delete (ac:3} from Fz. Now, Fz=( (bf: 1 ) , I  acd: I ), (bce:2), [abce: 1 ) );  6) Add (ac:3} in F1. Now, Fl=([b3],{c:4),{ac:3)); 7) Recursively call GenRule(FI, Fi, RuleBaseSet); 8) Until the rule abce=K1/5,?1) is derived and add it  in the Rulebaseset. Then delete ( (abce:l)] from F2. Now, Fz=$. Stop.

By the algorithm, we obtain 13 rules shown as Table 2,  4)  which near 1/4 of the original total 51 rules?ll.

Based on these properties, a generalized association d e base of the database is obtained, which keeps the information of all association rules and has conform structure that is convenient for practical applications.

Finally, the mining algorithm of the generalized association rule base is presented and its validity is proved.
