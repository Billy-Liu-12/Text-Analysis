Realization of Share Downlink Carrier between  CDMA2000 1x and 1x EV-DO

Abstract?In order to realize the wireless access with big capacity and multi-user, 1x EV-DV was proposed by 3GPP2.

However, according to our analysis of the CDMA-system capacity, we conclude that the technology of blinding channel and variable modulation, which is adopted in 1x EV-DV, are unreasonable and can not support high-speed data server. Base on these analyses, we propose a CDMD/TDMA reform scheme, which can support CDMA2000 1x and 1x EV-DO compatible working on a share carrier. In the reform scheme, TMDA channel is employed for 1x EV-DO high-speed data user and CDMA channel for CDMA2000 1x voice or low-speed date user.

The TDMA user and CDMA user are identified by independent PN sequence channel address codes, which makes the interference eliminator well implement. At same time, we also propose the implement block diagram with brief introduction.

I.  INTRODUCTION Third Generation (3G) Mobile Communication System  should been designed to cater for the needs of wireless Internet service of high-speed data downlink transmission  as well as the massive low-speed data rate or the voice user.  However, the main technical deficiency of CDMA system is that the up- downlink capacity is approximately equal, and the self- interference in CDMA cell increases accompanying with the signal power increasing, which make the cell capacity keeping almost the same. It?s incapable to enhance the spectrum utilization by increasing transmission power. Although it can be amended by some advanced technique, the performance-to- price ratio will drop rapidly. Moreover, more broad uplink band is unnecessary ,which will result in serious waste of frequency resource, and it?s the main reason that cdma2000 standards throws away CDMA2000 3x part and turns to EV- DO (Evolution-Date Only), which is based on TDMA.

CDMA2000 1x EV-DO have been implemented commercially and the situation is very well. This also demonstrates from another aspect that the sole CDMA system is very difficult to realize the multi-speed compatibility because of its self- interference[1]-[4].

This article first give a brief introduction to 1x EV-DO and 1x EV-DV, and we will derive the relationship between receiving power rP and bit-rate bR  in CDMA multi-speed system, which will point out that 1x EV-DV is short of the support of technical and theoretical basis. Then a feasible  CDMA/TDMA scheme is given. Finally a concrete example of this scheme will be supported in the cdma2000.



II. INTRODUCTION OF 1X EV-DO AN 1X EV-DV In the application of wireless broadband Internet access,  CDMA system can not meet the special requirement, which requires the heaver downlink capacity than uplink capacity, which is also the major cause of cdma2000 3x standard?s abortion. Currently, cdma2000 3x has been substituted by 1x EV-DO. 1x EV-DO supports data packet services of up to 3.072 Mbps in the forward link and 460.8 Kbps in the reverse link - using just 1.23 MHz of spectrum - and has a typical cell radius of 5 to 15 km. The cdma2000 1xEV-DO is fully mobile with no line-of-sight required. 1x EV-DO is a new standard based on CDMA2000 1x RC3 and these two have similar values of uplink parameters because of the low demand for data rate. The prominent change happens in downlink, introducing TDMA mode for user identification, preamble 64nW  for user channel distinguishing, 16nW  for user sub-channel in one TDMA time slot and variable modulation types like QPSK, 8PSK, 16QAM for variable data rate. Each user spread factor (SF) is decided by base station (BS) according to the condition of signal transmission fading, SF?80~2.

Because 1x EV-DO mainly employ TDMA mode and variable modulation mode of high spectrum efficiency , such as 8PSK ,16QAM, it can enhance frequency utilization and increase the rate of downlink data to a large extend by increasing  the base station sent power, which can satisfy the demand of mobile Internet access.

The primary difference between 1xEV-DV and 1xEV-DO is that the former can transmit signals of voice or low-speed data besides high-speed data on independent downlink carrier.

1xEV-DV employ the same radio configuration with cdma2000 1x for voice or low-speed data transmissions, using the rest Walsh code resource to form two TDMA mode channels transmitting high-speed data. The corresponding data rate ( bR ) can be divided to eighteen levels: 81.6 kbit/s, 158.4 kbit/s, ?, 3 091.2 kbit/s, the encoding ratio of Turbo codes is 1/5 and the modulation types are QPSK, 8PSK, 16QAM[1]. Following, we can prove that the designed aim of 1x EV-DV can not achieve.

Many kinds of reform scheme achieving multi-rate once has been employed in the CDMA system, such as code channel blinding technology, which was extremely unreasonable, for self-interference existing between CDMA subchannels. In IS-       95 system, considering the asymmetry of up-downlink, the uplink adopts the truncating transmission-time method to adjust user data rate and the downlink adopts transmitting repeatedly.

The two methods both could keep spread factor (SF) fixed to avoid the disadvantageous phenomena that strong signal submerges feeble signal in receiver. Variable spread factor (VSF) is inducted to adjust bit rate in 3G system, which could avoid self-interference among, perhaps can bring submergence.

In conclusion, it?s difficult to find a reasonable user rate adjusting to scheme in CDMA mode.



III. RECEIVING POWER rP , BIT-RATE bR AND DOWNLINK CAPACITY IN CDMA MULTI-RATE SYSTEM[4]  In multi-bit-rate bR CDMA system, user interference rN is different along with user-data bit-rate bR . Suppose that there are N voice users and only 1 data user in CDMA system, transmission rate is bvR  and bdR  respectively and bdR = K bvR . And in uplink, the receiving power of voice users and data user by base station are rvP  and rdP  respectively, then, for a certain voice user the spectral density of interference power tvN = 0N  + (( 1) ) /rv rdN P P W? + , where W stands for bandwidth of spreading signal; 0N  stands for spectral density of thermal noise. For data user, tdN =  0N + /rvNP W . Apparently, tdN < tvN . In the following, a detail derivation of the relationship between rP  and bR  in multi-rate bR  CDMA system will be given.

Note that the threshold of receiving signal-to-noise ratio SNR= ( )/b t dBE N should be independent of transmission rate bR  when the required receiving BER is fixed. Suppose that, in  uplink, the receiving power of voice user and data user by BS is P rv  and P rd  respectively. According to the threshold of SNR, the receiving power of base station required is deduced.

( / )b tE N = ( / ) /rd bd tdP R N =d, then  rdP = 0( / )bd td bd rvdR N bR N NP W= + .

With the same principle, we get  rvP = 0( (( 1) ) / )bv tv bv rv rddR N bR N N P P W= + ? +  And  ( )0  / (( 1) ) /  rvrd  rv rv rd  K N NP WP P N N P P W  + =  + ? + (1)  Generally, thermal noise is far weaker than self- interference, so 0N  can be ignored. And N >>1,  (1) could be simplified to be   4 2 rd  rv  P N NKN P  = + ?                         (2)  Suppose there are N voice users and M data users, then (2) alters as  ( ) ( )2' 1 1 2 2  rd  rv  N K M N K MP KNK P M M M  ? ?? ? ? ? = = + ?? ?  ? ?  (3)  When N=30, M=1, 8, K=6, 12, 24, and 48 respectively, we draw the table ? as follows:  TABLE I.  VALUES OF K?, K   AND   M  K M K? K/K?    1 5 1.2 4 5.4 1.11 8 5.6 1.07    1 9 1.33 4 10.3 1.17 8 10.9 1.1    1 15.7 1.53 4 19.7 1.22 8 21.4 1.12    1 25.8 1.86 4 38 1.26 8 42.5 1.13    Known from table ?, under the condition of CDMA, when the number of data users is high, for example M=8, and when K= ( / ) 6bd bvR R ? , and BER is certain, we get K? ? K, which means that the receiving power ratio of user is in positive proportional to their data-rate ratio. That is to say, in this condition, the occupied capacity arising would cause the required transmitting power increasing. But when K=48 and M=1, we get K/K?=1.86. At this time, the data rate equals to the binding of 48 voice users rate, while needed transmitting power just equals to 25.8 voice users, meaning that the transmitting power is cut in half approximately, meanwhile self-interference drops dramatically and system capacity increases. For the huge margin between the required receiving powers of the two channels, submergence is inevitable.

The above conclusion is also applicable to downlink and VSF CDMA system. bR  changes with SF, so when the SF of two code channel is smaller than 6, the capacity of low SF code channel is in positive proportion to the binding of many code channels. But in CDMA/TDMA system, data-rate of TDMA code channel is quite high, which can enhance power utilization and system capacity largely.

When the transmission rate of voice signal is 9.6kb/s in IS- 95, system maximum user number of single carrier in downlink can be calculated as following.

Based on the received SNR in downlink, it can be derived as follows:      ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )  ( )max  /  / /  / 1 / ( )  t p bb  t th t p t p  b  mP L NRE d N FN k n P L W mP L NW  N m W R d k n  = ? + + ?  ? + +? ?? ?  (4)  Where tmP  stands for total transmission power of traffic channels and the range of m varies from 0.71 to 0.76[2] and here, m = 0.76; pL  stands for wireless link loss, k = 0.5 stands for synchronous address code in downlink. The physical signification of (4) is clear that the numerator is the bit energy of receiver, t p t p/ ( ) / ( )kP L W mP L N W? ? ? ?  in denominator is the cell self-interference produced by one cell and t p/ ( )nP L W? , the interference introduced by adjacent cells, whose value can be adjusted by n, where the range of n is from 0.04 to 1.778.

According to (4), the maximum number of voice users in downlink of cdma2000 standard can be obtained with the relevant parameters given above respectively. Table ? only lists the results of IS-95 because of the same allocation shared by cdma2000 and IS-95.  Note that there are three kinds of  maxN  in Table ?, respectively corresponding to n = 0.04, 0.6 and 1.778 in order. It is worthy further study if maxN can be used as the actual number of cell users while we only take 60% of maxN for reference generally. The actual number of cell users is 13 for cdma2000 1x system [3].

TABLE II.       NUMBER OF USERS IN DOWNLINK  IS-95 WCDMA  N max  62/30/14 93/45/22  R maxb (kbps, n=0.6) 288 549    The result of (4) explains that maxN  (the cell capacity) is decided by self-interference in CDMA systems. In other words, increasing BS transmit power, to be followed by the rise of self-interference, cannot increase cell capacity. When 16QAM is applied, the required threshold d of receiving would increase, which leads to the cell capacity almost the same way. That is to say it is hard for 3G system to realize its original design intention?wireless Internet access with high speed. In order to satisfy the requirement, bR  in downlink should be more than ten times that in uplink. bmaxR is not tailor for only one or two users, because 3G standards are a common multi-user communication system. If the self-interference eliminator is introduced in downlink,   (4) is out of use. However, there is no sign to realize this plan because of the expense of multi-user receiver is too high.

Adjusting SF in downlink is another way to change user wireless access rate, bR  changes with SF, from the relationship between rP and bR , Adjusting SF gets the same result with binding code channels, which  cannot increase the  system capacity and may bring submergence. Thus, for 3G primary standards, it is impossible to provide the nominal user wireless date rate of 384 kbit/s and 2 Mbit/s in mobile environment of pedestrian and indoor respectively.

1x EV-DV scheme adopts TDMA mode after binding available code channels and variable modulation mode to increase bR . Firstly, binding code channels will produce self- interference among subchannels of receiving signal, which is quite questionable. Secondly, data-rate ratio among the binding code channels is small. Known from the equation derived above, TDMA mode with code channels binding couldn?t increase system capacity significantly.

On the other hand, it is not easy to use the modulation mode with high frequency spectrum efficiency in CDMA system, because power efficiency of these modulations is low, and will be able to increase the self-interference and reduce the system capacity. Therefore, its function is not big if 1x EV-DV system wants to enhance the date rate through changing the modulation mode system.



IV. THE REFORM SCHEME OF CDMA/TDMA TO REALIZE MULTI-SPEED  COMPATIBILITY  In view of the difficult realization of 1x EV-DV, a feasible carrier-share CDMA/TDMA reform scheme is proposed here.

The primary characteristic of this scheme is employing CDMA2000 1x and 1x EV-DO technology in same frequency point simultaneously, and two short PN sequences formerly used to function as address codes for different cells, are allocated to CDMA and TDMA channel respectively as channel address codes. Obviously, the scheme does not assign independent special frequency point to 1x EV-DO. In other words, only one frequency point is used in a cell. TDMA channel is used for the high speed data user and CDMA channel for the voice or the low-speed data user. The TDMA channels and CDMA channels are distinguished by short PN sequence address code. Meanwhile, high-speed signal of TDMA code channel will interfere with the receiving of voice or low speed data user seriously. Thus simple interference eliminator must be introduced in their voice-user receivers, merely to eliminate self-interference of the one high speed data channel. Certainly, in order to improve the service quality of high-speed data users, the interference eliminator could also be used in the receiver, to eliminate interference caused by the other PN address code channel for voice or low speed data users. Considering the interference of adjacent cell, the complexity of interference eliminator would arise slightly, yet much easier to implement compared with multi-user receiver.

For the uplink, We still employ CDMA2000 1x technology.

Because we simultaneously employ CDMA2000 1x and 1x EV-DO on one carrier in a cell, the spectrum efficiency of downlink will be improved to a large extend, which will be able to satisfy the Internet access demands and realize the CDMA/TDMA compatibility. Hence, the transmitting power of TDMA code channel and the system self-interference could be reduced, and the efficiency of transmitting power improved drastically, since the rate-ratio between TDMA code channel and voice channel is quite high. Moreover, the key technology needed is much simpler compared with the existing B3G      11S  12S  1NS  21S 31S 41S 51S 52S  5NS2W7PN  3W8PN  6QS IPN QPN  7IS 9S  6IS  7QS  1 NW +6 NPN +  11D 12D  1MD  + +  DS 1DS 1DIS  2DQS  DIPN DQPN  2DIS  1DQS  8IS  8QS  technology. This kind of cell single carrier frequency point CDMA/TDMA system can achieve the voice and high-speed data user capacity, and can approach to the sum of the original  double downward frequency of CDMA2000 1x and 1x EV-DO systems.

Figure 1.  Transmitting frame of BS  The transmitting circuit frame of BS is described in Fig.1.

After N voice or the low-speed user data 1iS pass through baseband signal processing , scrambling code, address Walsh code spread spectrum and gain scale, they are add in adder. The outputs of adder are I-Phase and Quadrate component. At this time, complex scrambling is made through short PN code. The short PN sequence, which serve as the cell address code originally, have the double function of cell address code and channel address code for voice and low-speed date user now.

For high-speed user data 1iD ??? 1ND  , through 1x EV-DO baseband signal processing , serial-parallel converting, pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) transformation, is processed by a different short scrambling code, whose function is similar to the short PN sequence in the voice. Attention should be paid to that these short PN sequences used in high- speed user channel are different from these short PN sequences used in voice or low-speed data channel, but they are working in the same frequency point. Fig. 2 is the structure frame of downlink. The wireless signal is proposed through radio frequency and orthogonal demodulation. And then two are delivered to the interference canceller and user data demodulates and the separated signals can be achieve in output, that are high-speed data and voice or low-speed data .

Figure 2.  Downlink structure frame  In Fig.2 the interference eliminator and users date demodulator include two interference eliminators. One is to eliminate the channel interference of voice or low-speed date  user brought by the high-speed TDMA channel, which can output the voice and low-speed date, and the other is to eliminate the interference of high-speed channel caused by voice or low-speed date user CDMA channel, which can output the signal of high-speed data-user.



V. CONCLUSION The CDMA/TDMA reform scheme can support the  cdma2000 1x and 1x EV-DO compatibly working on common frequency point with the less complexity of system.  The scheme can increase the spectrum utilization efficiency of downlink, which can make the capacity of CDMA/TDMA system equal to the sum of double frequency point cdma2000 1x and 1x EV-DV system, and it can exempt the problem of setting special frequency point, which will significantly enhance the spectrum utilization efficiency of 900 MHz frequency band which is optimal but scarce for vehicular mobile communication. In this reform scheme, we use interference eliminator to eliminate the self-interference caused by TDMA high-speed data channel or CDMA voice channels, which make the base-station equipment for sending and receiving letters simple and easy to implement, without using sorts of novel but hard-to-realize techniques of B3G. Moreover, because of very high rate ratio of TDMA channel and voice channel the self-interference of system can be reduced.
