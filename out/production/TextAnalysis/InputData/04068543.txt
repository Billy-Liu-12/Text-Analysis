Research on Application of Association Rule Algorithm in Intelligence Transportation System

Abstract- to support the decision-making of traffic control effectively, an association rules algorithm based on data cube was proposed in the paper. First, data cube from database was set up.

Then frequent item-set which satisfied the minimum support on data cube was mined out. Furthermore, association rules of frequent item-set were obtained. Finally, redundant association rules were wiped off through the relative method. The algorithm had two advantages, the first was that the executing time of the algorithm was short while searching for the frequent item- set; the second was that the rules' interest degree was high. The algorithm was also used intelligence traffic system and a few effective patterns were obtained. The results manifested that the algorithm was effective in decision- making support of traffic control.



I. INTRODUCTION  Intelligent transportation system (ITS) is a most promising method in dealing with the traffic problems [1]. One of the key problems of ITS is the analysis and management of traffic information [2]. Some superficial information is obtained easily though traditional query operation from traffic data, but deep level information that hides in the traffic data is difficult to be discovered. Deep level information usually contains overall characteristics of data and forecast information of data development tendency. Data mining currently is hot topic research area and is applied in database, artificial intelligence, statistics, and so on [3]. It may discover valuable knowledge and the patterns in the large-scale database for users. Data mining method mainly contains association rule mining, classification and so on [4]. Association rule mining may discover the combination patterns among items. These patterns may instruct the policy-maker to make the corresponding decision, Thus, the validity and scientific of traffic control are enhanced.

At present, many scholars have carried on a great deal of  researches on association mining algorithms, such as Apriori algorithm. But those algorithms had some disadvantages. For example, the executing time of their algorithms was long while searching for the frequent item sets and the rules' interest degree was low. A large number of redundant rules were also included. Besides, the complexity of space and time was high.

Yu Ying Department of Information & Technology  Central China Normal University  Wuhan, 430079, Hubei, China lovelyfish08201163.com  Aiming at above question, an association mining algorithm based on data cube is proposed in the paper. It have improved the traditional algorithms and introduced the relative method in statistics. The algorithm is used in ITS. The results manifests that the algorithm is effective.



II. ASSOCIATION RULES MINING  The steps of association rules mining based on data cube as follows[5]:  Step 1: setting up data cube from database Step2: mining frequent item-set which satisfies the  minimum support on data cube Step3: association rules of frequent item-set are generated.

Step4: redundant association rules through the relative  method are wiped off.

A. Setting Up Data Cube Supposed in the traffic database, we observe the data by  three dimensional angles. These three dimensions separately are violating regulation dimension, driver dimension and vehicle dimension. Then data cube was obtained through OLAP operation from data base. Fig.1 is data cube by 3-D.

violating regulation dim ens i on  river dimerns i on  vehicle dimension  Figurel. Data cube by 3-D Each dimension relates to one table that is called dimension  table [6]. It carries on further description to the dimension. For example, driver dimension contains name, sex, age, address, ID, education level and so on.

Above the specific angle (dimension) also has many different descriptions in detail degree. This kind of description is called dimension level [7]. One dimension generally has the many levels. For example, the description of time dimension may describe different level from year, quarter, month, date and so on. Year, quarter, month, and date are the dimension level of time.

B. Mining Frequent Item-set on Data Cube The article has improved Apriori algorithm. The algorithm  searching for the frequent item-set on data cube is called Traffic_ Cube Apriori algorithm. Lk Represents sets of frequent k_ item-set, Ck Represents sets of candidate k_ item- set.

The idea of Traffic _ Cube Apriori algorithm as follows: Firstly, the algorithm searches frequent k item-set for each  dimension. If some dimensions don't have frequent k_ item- set, it shows that the dimension level is excessively low and we should drill through above and improve the dimension level. If in some dimensions, all frequent k item-set is frequent k item-set, it shows that the dimension level is excessively high and we should drill through under and lower dimension level.

CK = gen _ candidate(Lk l) Represents set of frequent (k- 1) item-set joining, pruning and generating k_ item-set.

C. Generating irredundant association rules After mining out frequent item-set, the process of obtaining  association rules divides into two steps: Step 1: regarding to each frequent item-set 1, all non- spatial  subsets are generated.

Step2: regarding to each non- spatial subset of frequent  item-set 1, if  support count(l) >min conf (1) sup port count(s)  Then the rule s=> (1-s) is generated. min conf represent the minimum confidence thresholds, support count(l) represents the number of transaction containing item-set 1, support count(s) represents the number of transaction containing item- set s.

Lower interest rules are obtained in this way, so the  redundant rules must be wiped off. Thus, the paper introduces the relative analysis method in statistics to wipe off the redundant rules. After mining out one association rule, we appraised correlation among frequent item-set. Concept of correlation is formula 2  CORR = O(r) (2) E(r)  CORRr More approaches to 1, the independence among r item-set set is better. For example, the association rule X=> Y, X, Y is the item-set. If its correlation is worse, it must be the false strong rule.

Relative analysis method is applied in k dimension data cube. If item or dimension Y is Y,Y2, -, Yr r values, X is XI,X2, Xs s values, nil represents the number of X is Y and X is Xi.

Namely, they are independent.



III. APPLICATION OF ASSOCIATION RULE ALGORITHM IN ITS  In the ITS, violating regulation information, driver information and vehicle information are quite tedious. This original data is difficult to mine out the effective patterns. So, data cube is set up according to the interested information in original data. Then integrate the data, process data and start mining. Finally, the patterns that are mined out are evaluated.

Mining process  A. Setting up trafic data cube 3-D traffic data cube is obtained through OLAP operation  according to original data (Fig. 1). Each dimension relates to one table. Violating regulation dimension table contains vehicle plate number, vehicle type, violation regulation type, time, location, etc. (see table 1).

TABLEI VIOLATION REGULATION DIMENSION TABLE  Driver information table contains name, address, ID, sex, driving certificate date, education and other related inform- ation (see table 2).

TABLE2 DRIVER DIMENSION TABLE  Plate Name ID Education Driving number certificate  date Ex0001 Zhang XXXXX Junior middle 2004-6  Yu school Ex0541 Li XXXXX Junior middle 2003-2  ei school_  Ex0046 Wang XXXXX Senior middle 2006-1 Ming school  Vehicle information contains car type, affiliated group, con- dition, and so on.

B. Datapreprocessing  In order to mine out the effective patterns, it is necessary to carry on data preprocess. Considering the mining efficiency, we adopt generalized data processing method. The date data may generalize as Year (Y2000-Y2004), Month (M1-M12), Day (D1-D31), Week (W1-W7), morning (TI) (5:01-8:30), forenoon (T2) (8:31-11:30), noon (T3) (11:31-14:30), afternoon (T4) (14:31-17:30), evening (T5) (17:31-19:30), night (T6) (19:31-5:00).

Vehicle-owner age is obtained through the vehicle-owner ID card number, and age is generalized according to the distance (Eal) [<20], (Ea2) [20-29], (Ea3) [30-39], (Ea4) [40- 49], (Ea5) [50-59], (Ea6) [>=60].

Driving age is generalized according to driving certificate data (Cel) [<1], (Ce2) [1-2], (Ce3) [2-3], (Ce4) [3-5], (Ce5) [5-10], (Ce6) [10-20], (Ce7) [>=20] (unit: Year).

Regarding other data, like violation regulation type [V1-Vn],  the vehicle type [CT1-CTn], violation place [L1-Ln], sex[maleO,Female 1] ,education[EO:elementaryschool], [El: Jun ior middle school],[E2: Senior middle school],[E3: technological academy],[E4: Undergraduate course],[E5: Master],[E6: Doctor].

C. Mining Patterns andevaluation The frequent patterns is obtained by mining nearly 50,000  effective data in the ITS database. The smallest support is 0.01, and the lowest degree of confidence is 0.1O.Finally, frequent patterns of effective association rules as follows: R1:L5=> VI 10%, 16% indicates that the possibility of  running a red light in place L5 is 16%, and support degree is 1 0o.

R2:E2=> V2 31%, 42% indicates that the possibility of the driver that education is senior middle school running a red light is 42%, and support degree is 3 1%.

R3:Tl=> VI 36%, 40%0 indicates that the possibility of  running a red light in the morning is 40?0, and support degree is 36%.

Plate Vehicle Violation Time place Driving number type regulation Orienta-t  type ion  ExOOO1 Small Running 2006- Beijin From Red light 01-02 g East to  15:30 Road West .23  Ex0541 Big Turn 2005- Nanjin From around 12-7 g East to against 10:03:25 Road West violating regulation  Ex0046 Big Drive 2006- Jiangh Form taking up 3-1 an South to  road 9: 10:30 Road North    Form the mining patterns above; we can conclude that running a red light in place L5 is very serious. In fact, this place is the access to province level roads and the peripheral municipal traffic transportation. The traffic flow is big.

Simultaneously, L5 is away from the urban district and the police force is separated. The suggestion is that the road with hairpin curves or the multi-level crossing bridge should be constructed to reduce the traffic pressure; we also increase police force to strengthen management. In violation regulation records, the vehicle-owners that education is elementary school are so many. It also explains that the driver's self- consciousness of observing traffic regulations at this education level is not high. Regarding this the education level drivers, we should strengthen training to enhance the self- consciousness of observing the traffic regulations. The serious time interval of violation regulations is the early morning when people go to work On many roads, the management of traffic police can not catch up with the needs, the better management is expected to enhance.



IV. CONCLUSION  The article has realized TrafficCube_Apriori algorithm with VC++ on the foundation of Apriori. The test data set is obtained from above ITS. In the experiment, computer is Pentium IV, the frequency is 2.OGMHz, memory is 256MB, and operation system is Windows 2000. Fig.4 is experiment result, Y axis is spending time t (ms) of generating frequent item-set, and X axis is the distribution of minimum support  - Apr or -in- Traffi cjCube-Apri ort (ms)  5000 F  4000 r   degree, ranging from 50% to 5%.

From Fig.4, we know that support degree is lower, the  running time is longer. When minimum support degree is bigger, the execution time of two algorithms is approached. In a word, when they have same minimum support degree, the execution time of TrafficCube_Apriori is shorter than Apriori.

In summary, an association rule based on data cube is proposed in the paper. The algorithm is also used in intelligent transportation system. The result manifests that the algorithm is effective through testing in intelligent transportation system.

I wish that this article's work could give some references to certain people.
