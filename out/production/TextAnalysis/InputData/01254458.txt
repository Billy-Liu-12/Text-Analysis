In Silico Discovery of Cancer-Related Genes

Abstract  Clinically, cancer is a complex family of diseases.

From the viewpoint of molecular biology, cancer is a  genetic disease resulting from abnormal gene expres-  sion due to DNA instability, such as translocation,  amplification, deletion or point mutations. The pur-  pose of this study was first to perform functional  analysis of a set of cancerous genes, and to discover  or predict the other human genes that are hypotheti-  cally cancer-related. To achieve this goal, an ap-  proach consisting of three major components was  proposed. Firstly, an automatic system has been de-  veloped to collect different data sets from the inter-  net, like human genes, proteins, and functional do-  mains. Secondly, the functional domain compositions  extracted from proteins were adopted for grouping  the cancerous genes into a number of clusters by hi-  erarchical clustering and association rule methods.

The functional domains commonly existing in a clus-  ter of genes represented the characteristic of that  cluster. A second set of hypothetically cancerous  genes predicted by single nucleotide polymorphism  (SNP) was utilized for testing purpose. The experi-  mental result indicated that a total accuracy of  81.45% was reached. It is anticipates that the pro-  posed approach can be applied to other genetic dis-  eases with minor modification.

1. Introduction  Clinically, cancer is a complex family of genetic  diseases due to abnormal gene expression resulting  from DNA instability, such as translocation, amplifi-  cation, deletion, or point mutations. These altered  chromosome regions contain genes coding for  regulatory factors involved in cell proliferation,  differentiation or death regulation, probably,  oncogenes in the amplified regions and tumor  suppressor genes in lost regions. A number of  oncogenes have been identified and characterized.

From the sequence comparison, these genes exist as  families or even super families. Alternatively,  lies. Alternatively, oncogenes can be functionally  grouped into several classes. Many of them are part  of signal transduction pathways, which are growth  accelerators. On the contrary, tumor suppressors are  the brakes of growth. Loss of function of tumor sup-  pressors increases tumor formation. Many tumor  suppressor genes have been identified as well. Like  oncogenes, however, they present only the tip of the  iceberg. It is therefore necessary to develop a high-  throughput approach to identify the large part of ge-  netic mutations that cause cancer, instead of using the  traditional one-by-one analysis method.

According to the central dogma of molecular bi-  ology, as illustrated in Figure 1, DNA replication and  repair are the processes that keep the genome correct  and faithful from one generation to the next. In addi-  tion, DNA sequence is the genotype and carries the  genetic information that is transcribed to RNA and  subsequently translated to protein, which is the phe-  notype. In general, proteins contain functional do-  mains that naturally up- or down-regulate gene ex-  pression. Functional domain analysis of cancer-  related genes reveals important information for min-  ing of unknown genes that are cancer-related. Conse-  quently, the proposed approach consists of three ma-  jor components, including automatic data acquisition  of relevant data sets, functional domain analysis of  cancer-related genes, and discovery of cancer-related  genes from the human genome. An in silico experi-  ment for effectiveness assessment of the system was  conducted by testing another set of cancer-related  genes from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) data-  bank. The percentage of correctness can be regarded  as an index of goodness.

The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-  lows. Section 2 provides a brief review of relevant  work regarding cancer research using bioinformatics  approaches. The proposed method and system archi-  tecture are presented in Section 3. Some experimen-  tal results and discussions are given in Section 4.

Section 5 concludes the study.

Proceedings of the IEEE Fifth International Symposium on Multimedia Software Engineering (ISMSE?03)     2. Related Work  Nowadays, different types of available technolo-  gies can be utilized in assisting researchers to study  cancer-related problems. Microarray (Furey et al.,  2001) and serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE)  (Ng et al., 2001) have already been used extensively  in large-scale gene expression analysis. Moreover,  two approaches are also important to detect amplifi-  cation or deletion of large chromosome regions: loss  of heterozygosity (LOH) (Emmert-Buck et al., 1997)  and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) (Kal-  lioniemi et al., 1992). These approaches generate a  huge amount of data that should be analyzed effec-  tively and efficiently. In general, hierarchical cluster-  ing is applied to microarray data for expression  analysis of cancer-related genes (Gracy and Argos,  1998; Alon et al., 1999; Enright and Ouzounis, 2000;  Ng et al., 2001; Whitfield et al., 2002). Recently,  support vector machines (Vapnik, 1995) have at-  tracted much attention in supervised classification,  such as tumor classification (Furey et al., 2001;  Adorj?n et al., 2002). Miscellaneous methods, like  self-organizing map (Kohonen, 1990), neighborhood  analysis (Golub, 1999) were used for gene classifica-  tion. Thorough comparisons of k-nearest neighbor,  neural networks, support vector machines, and deci-  sion tree can be found in the literature (Yeang et al.,  2001; Ryu and Cho, 2002). The association rules ap-  proach (Rastogi and Shim, 2002) is also applied to  the field of bioinformatics, such as gene expression  classification (Creighton and Hanash, 2002) and pro-  tein-protein interaction (Oyama et al., 2002).

Feature extraction plays an important role in clas-  sification and clustering. Amino acid composition is  commonly used to represent a protein (Nakashima  and Nishikawa, 1994). Wang et al. (2001) modified  the representation to be 2-gram amino acid composi-  tion to improve the accuracy of classification. Since  protein function is highly related to the conserved  domains presenting in a protein sequence, functional  domain composition (Chou and Cai, 2002) seems to  be a more effective representation as a sequence of 1s  and 0s (Questier, 2002; Chou and Cai, 2002). An-  other kind of approaches is based on text categoriza-  tion (Kwok, 1998; Joachims, 1998; He et al., 2000;  Tong and Koller, 2001) of gene and/or protein anno-  tations in textual format.

In the previous work (Tsai et al., 2003a; Tsai et  al., 2003b), discovering cancer-related genes relied  on the analysis of LOH information presented in the  literature to select chromosome regions with high po-  tential. Genes within the selected chromosome re-  gions were analyzed by text categorization approach.

3. Materials and Methods  The previous work greatly relies on experienced  researchers providing domain knowledge for the pre-  diction task of cancer-related genes. To alleviate the  extent of human intervention, a supervised approach  is proposed by functional analysis of verified cancer  genes in advance. The next phase then performs dis-  covering task of hypothetically cancerous genes from  the human genome based on the analyzed rules. The  proposed approach hence consists of three major  components: automatic collection of data sets from  the internet, functional analysis of confirmed cancer-  ous genes using hierarchical clustering and associa-  tion rule methods, and prediction validation of rec-  ognized genes that are cancer-related. The process  flowchart, as illustrated in Figure 2, includes two  process flows. The training phase drawn as dash lines  starts with feeding a set of training data into the sys-  tem. Upon the completion of training phase, a list of  protein families is generated for the prediction phase,  as illustrated by solid lines. Similar to the training  data set, feature extraction is performed for the set of  human genes. Skipping of protein functional domain  analysis, two data sets are compared to discover hy-  pothetically cancer-related genes.

3.1 Data Sets  Two major data sets were collected automatically  from the internet. The training data set was available  from the Resources Centre INFOBIOGEN  (http://www.infobiogen.fr/) databank. Of 212 genes  verified as cancer-related, six genes could not be re-  trieved from the NCBI databank due to the difference  of code names or lack of information. The testing  data set of cancerous genes predicted by single nu-  cleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was from the Na-  tional Cancer Institute (http://www.nci.nih.gov/) da-  tabank. The data set contains 2834 cancer-related  genes classified into one or more of 18 categories. A  third data set containing more than 35,000 human  genes were collected from the NCBI databank. It is  expected that the cancer-related genes can be identi-  fied as many as possible from the huge data set.

The translated protein sequence of each gene  from these three data sets was obtained as well for  functional domain retrieval from the Conserved Do-  main Database (Pfam v8.0). By using Reverse Posi-  tion Specific BLAST (RPS-BLAST 2.2.6) with ex-  pect value set as 10-4 for protein sequence align-  ment, the genes containing at least one functional  domain were selected for this study. A value-added  database was then constructed and updated regularly  without human intervention.

3.2 Functional Domain Composition  Extracting representative features for each gene is  of importance to functional analysis of cancerous  genes. Instead of retrieving relevant annotation and  analyzing the characteristics of each gene by using  text categorization approach, functional domain  composition was considered as an effective represen-  tation for this study. The meaning is twofold. First,  Proceedings of the IEEE Fifth International Symposium on Multimedia Software Engineering (ISMSE?03)     the genes with annotations have been usually studied  or functionally predicted. Those genes without func-  tional annotations, however, are more concerned.

Second, experienced cancer researchers are involved  to construct a lexical database for keywords, and thus  reduce the degree of automation.

Each protein selected for this study contains at  least one functional domain. The order and repetition  of functional domains are not considered. The prob-  lem of functional analysis of N cancerous genes can  be regarded as performing clustering task in a vector  space with high dimensions. A gene is defined as  }1,0{,],,,,,[ 21 ?= ij T  iMijiiii xxxxxXg  (1)  which states that a gene gi is translated into a protein  Xi expressed as a vector of M dimensions, and each  dimension stands for the existence status of a func-  tional domain in a protein or the so-called functional  domain composition. For instance, xij = 1 means that  protein i possesses functional domain j. The dimen-  sion number M depends on the number of unique  functional domains identified from the set of training  data, i.e. the proteins translated from the set of can-  cerous genes. Empirically, it is very rare that a pro-  tein contains more than ten unique domains.

3.3 Hierarchical Clustering  The training set of cancerous genes was first  grouped into many families of genes so that each  family would possess specific characteristics. Due to  the lack of a priori knowledge of the relationship be-  tween cancerous genes and functional domains, the  grouping task must be done in an unsupervised fash-  ion. In addition, the number of gene families was un-  known. Accordingly, hierarchical clustering was util-  ized because of its flexibility in presenting the level  of similarity between two genes, defined as  ),(1),( jiji XXpggs ?=  (2)  = =  =  ??  ?? =  M  k  M  k jjkiik  M  k jjkiik  ji  xxxx  xxxx XXp  1 1    )()(  ))(( ),(  (3)  where equation (3) is the Pearson correlation coeffi-  cient and ix  is the arithmetic average of the M  components of vector Xi. In addition, various linkage  rules used in hierarchical clustering may yield differ-  ent results, depending on the distribution pattern of  data sets. The average linkage rule was utilized to  avoid two extreme cases, i.e. single for the nearest  neighbor and complete for the farthest neighbor.

3.4 Association Rules  In addition to the grouping task of cancerous  genes, the frequency of functional domains  commonly appearing in a set of proteins was studied  as well. Association rules have been broadly used in  many areas and can be applied to functional domain  analysis as well. Functional domains presenting in a  protein can be thought of as a set of items that a cus-  tomer would likely purchase in one transaction,  where the quantity of an item is not considered. The  standard Apriori algorithm was used in this study. Al-  though the algorithm has its limitation when the  number of different items is very large, the total  number n of unique functional domains is manage-  able. Moreover, the number mi of unique domains in  protein Xi is much less than the total number M. Nu-  merous itemsets of different lengths were generated  by giving a support criterion, and a short itemset was  the subset of a long one. Figure 3 illustrates the hier-  archical relationships of itemsets, where the number  in a block denotes the functional domain PSSM ID.

The upper hierarchies demonstrate two pure families  that each domain belongs to only one family, and the  lower one explains a family tangling with two small  families. The domains within shaded blocks belong  to more than one family. For each gene cluster, a  rule-naming process based on the set of common  functional domains was performed manually by bi-  ologists in helping understanding the functionalities.

4. Results and Discussions  4.1 Cluster Distribution  The changes in name coding from different gene  databanks were unified by UniGene ID and 212  genes were found and translated to proteins. After  functional domain extraction by RPS-BLAST, 154  unique functional domains were extracted from the  set R of 167 cancerous genes. As illustrated in Figure  4, combining the results from hierarchical clustering  and association rules yields the distribution of can-  cerous genes in a 154?167 matrix and each column represents a gene gi containing at least one functional  domain xij. For convenience, a column is expressed  as gi xij  and marked in black in the figure. In reality,  only the gi xij  relationships were stored as pairs of  the form {gene ID, domain ID} in a database. The  distribution of the set R in the figure can be parti-  tioned into four sets by simple queries such that  )(  }11|{  }11|{  }11|{     IIIIIIIV  N  k kj  M  k ikijiIII  N  k kj  M  k ikijiII  N  k kj  M  k ikijiI  RRRRR  xxxgR  xxxgR  xxxgR  ???=  >?==  =?>=  =?==  ==  ==  ==  (4)  where i ? {1, ?, N} and j ? {1, ?, M}. The first constraint forces the genes in the sets RI and RIII to  have only one unique domain, and allows the genes  Proceedings of the IEEE Fifth International Symposium on Multimedia Software Engineering (ISMSE?03)     in the sets RII and RIV to possess multiple unique do-  mains. Similar to the first constraint, the second one  indicates how many genes have a common domain j.

Hence, there are no two genes in the sets RI and RII holding a common domain. The rest of genes not sat-  isfying both constraints are categorized into the RIV set. In Figure 4, the sets RI and RII contain 35 and 20  genes, respectively. The third set comprises 24 genes  grouped into 11 small clusters, and each gene cluster  has one unique functional domain in common. The  situation in the set RIV is somewhat irregular. There  are 88 genes grouped into 26 clusters, and each gene  cluster possesses partial functional domains in com-  mon.

In essence, the major domains commonly exist-  ing in a cluster dominate the idiosyncrasy of a gene  family. Zooming in on the set RIV demonstrates  clearly the problematic clusters, as shown in Figure  5. After manual examination of clustering result  based on domain functionality, seven genes were  misclassified. These genes were compared with the  other similar ones to find the common functional  domains, which were actually not the major domains  of the clusters. RBTN2, for instance, is similar to one  gene in Cluster 4-7-2 because of a common domain.

This domain, however, is not significant in that clus-  ter. Setting the threshold value of Pearson correlation  coefficient as 0.7 resulted in an elimination of these  genes and generated 32 small families of genes in  this region. The removed genes should be classified  into separate clusters.

4.2 Rule Generation  A rule ri in this study stands for a set of unique  functional domains, including the case of only one  domain, and is defined as  },,1{,: Mjxr ji ?  (5)  where xj is a functional domain. Different from the  previous notation, the double subscript is replaced  with a single one for generality, i.e. a domain does  not specifically belong to a gene. Totally 55 rules  were generated from 55 genes in the sets RI and RII.

Moreover, 37 rules were generated from the third and  fourth sets, and each rule denoted a set of major do-  mains commonly existing in an individual cluster of  genes. Consequently, family naming for each rule  was based on the major domains. Table 2 lists the  family names annotated manually and the associated  major domains of clusters. Finally, 92 rules consist-  ing of at least one functional domain were obtained  for exploring the human genome and predicting hy-  pothetically cancerous genes. Note that 28 out of 154  domains were eliminated during the rule generation  process because of their insignificance in the clusters,  and the reduction rate of functional domains was  around 18.2%. It is understandable from the disper-  sive pattern depicted in Figure 4 that cancer devel-  opment is a complex mechanism involving a number  of genes with different functionalities.

4.3 Effectiveness Assessment  The effectiveness of the generated rules was as-  sessed prior to discovery of cancerous genes from  human genome. The second set of hypothetically  cancerous genes identified by single nucleotide  polymorphisms was obtained from the National Can-  cer Institute and used for testing the rules. Due to the  nature of supervised learning, 690 genes containing  at least one of the 154 domains extracted from the  training set were selected for assessment. The result  indicated that 562 of the selected 690 genes could be  recognized as cancer-related by the 92 rules gener-  ated from the previous step. The total accuracy was  about 81.45%. Moreover, 96 of 562 cancer genes  were also included in the training data set, and hence  the rest of 466 genes were regarded as being pre-  dicted. Table 3 shows the detail information. Note  that some genes might belong to multiple categories.

The bar chart in Figure 6 demonstrates a comparison  of 18 categories having genes recognized as cancer-  related genes by the 92 rules. The last eight catego-  ries might not be statistically meaningful because of  fewer genes to be examined.

4.4 Cancer Gene Prediction  The ultimate goal of this study was to explore  cancer-related genes in human genome. To perform  prediction of cancer-related genes, 13662 of 35081  genes with functional domains were obtained from  the NCBI databank, and 3539 of 13662 genes con-  taining at least one of the 154 functional domains  from the training data set were selected for examina-  tion by the 92 rules. The result indicated that 2459  genes, i.e. 69.48%, were predicted as hypothetically  cancer-related genes by these rules. Due to the lack  of further information, these genes were retained for  laboratory verification.

5. Conclusion  In this paper, a supervised approach for high-  throughput analysis of functional domains and pre-  diction of cancer-related genes has been proposed. It  is anticipated that there exist strong relationships be-  tween specific functional domains and cancerous  genes. Accordingly, this proposed approach is unsuit-  able for those genes having no functional domains. It  should be pointed out that the effectiveness of the  approach lies in the sample number of training data  set. The more the training samples for functional  analysis, the better the predicted result. It, however,  still has a large room for improvement. For example,  adjustable weight could be introduced for iterative  analysis of functional domains to facilitate the clus-  tering. Moreover, the system with minor modifica-  Proceedings of the IEEE Fifth International Symposium on Multimedia Software Engineering (ISMSE?03)     tion could be a useful tool for candidate genes selec-  tion prior to laboratory experiments for other genetic  disease research.
