A Visual Approach for Spatio-Temporal Data Mining

Abstract  In this paper we propose a system for mining very large spatio-temporal datasets. The system comprises new tech- niques to efficiently support the data-mining process, ad- dress the spatial and temporal dimensions of the dataset, and visualize and interpret results. In particular, we have developed an advanced visualization tool for flexible and in- tuitive interaction with the dataset, including functionality for displaying association rules and variable distributions.

1 Introduction  Data mining techniques can be of significant value for spatio-temporal applications. Spatio-temporal data min- ing is a user-centric, interactive process, where both min- ing experts and domain experts work closely together to gain insight on the spatial and temporal evolution of a given phenomenon [5]. This process encompasses a set of exploratory, computational and interactive approaches for analyzing very large spatial and spatio-temporal datasets.

Within this context, several challenges remain: from the definition of mining techniques for dealing with spatial- temporal information to the development of effective meth- ods for interpreting and presenting the final results [2].

To this aim visualization techniques are very powerful within this context since they take advantage of human abil- ities to perceive visual patterns and to interpret them. How- ever spatial visualization features provided in existing geo- graphical applications are not adequate for decision-support when used alone. New solutions should not only include a static graphical view of the results produced during the mining process, but also the possibility to dynamically and interactively obtain different spatial and temporal views as well as interact in different ways with them. This can help in discovering details and patterns that might remain hid- den otherwise. Within this context, the main challenges remain how to visualize the spatio-temporal multidimen-  sional dataset and how to define effective visual interfaces for viewing and manipulating the geometrical components of the spatial data.

To address these issues, we have developed a system for exploratory spatio-temporal data mining. The aim of this system is to enable data mining tools to provide some form of localization in the data being analyzed, as well as to in- teractively visualize in 3D the outcome of the mining pro- cess, thus leading to greater effectiveness and significance of the results. To achieve these goals, the system includes a data mining engine that can integrate different algorithms (to work with specific types of datasets) and a 3D visualiza- tion tool.

The visualization tool exploits Java3D to provide advanced user interaction with the mining results. Key features in- clude the possibility to visualize both the data satisfying specific mining rules and the shape of the rules extracted.

This allows discovering specific relationships between the shape of the initial dataset and the shape of specific rules, i.e. the characteristics of the initial dataset and all uncov- ered laws controlling the observed event. Standard visual- ization tools for geo-spatial data do not provide this func- tionality.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the main components of the proposed system.

Section 3 discusses related work, while Section 4 provides details of our data mining approach. Section 5 presents the visualization tool. Section 6 is dedicated to the selected case study including a very large real world dataset and to a dis- cussion of experimental results. Finally in Section 7 we present some conclusions and ideas for future work.

2 System Overview  The Data Mining process usually consists of three phases: 1) pre-processing or data preparation, 2) modelling and val- idation and, 3) post-processing or deployment. During the first phase, the data may need cleaning and transformation according to possible constraints imposed by some tools, al- gorithms, or users. The second phase consists of choosing     or building a model that better reflects the application be- haviour. Such a model should be evaluated in terms of its efficiency and accuracy of its predictive results. Finally, the third step consists of using the selected model to effectively study the application behaviour. Usually, the model output requires some post-processing in order to exploit it. This step can benefit from data visualization, since interactivity and user expertise are very important in the final decision- making and data interpretation.

The mining process for spatial data is more complex than for relational data in terms of both the mining efficiency and the complexity of possible patterns that can be extracted from spatial datasets. The reason is that the attributes of neighboring patterns may have significant influence on a pattern and should also be considered. Therefore, new tech- niques are required to efficiently and effectively mine spa- tial datasets. Especially, in spatial data mining, the third phase is so important that some researchers incorporated most of its processes into phase two, such as automatic and interactive visualization of data, and called it Interac- tive Data Mining (IDM) [16]. IDM combines both auto- matic and visual data mining, and received much attention from users as it offers higher degree of satisfaction and con- fidence [9].

The system we have developed describes the behaviour of some natural phenomena, which have been monitored and recorded at several time instants. It is mainly intended to deal with datasets characterized by thematic properties, ex- pressed through values of attributes that change over time [3]. Our system relies on a standard three-tier architecture, including a data store at the back end, an application server, and a visualization component at the front end. The ap- plication server runs all application programs that perform the mining tasks. The mining engine produces an output model that contains structured results. In addition, the ap- plication server must include domain-specific wrappers that transform raw data into the input format required by the mining engine.

In order to interpret the output of the mining process, the results of the mining process must be displayed with dif- ferent visualization tools, possibly providing complemen- tary interacting functionality. In this first implementation we have developed a powerful application to support ex- ploratory visual data interpretation. Such an application displays the output of the mining process in a 3D virtual environment with full interactivity features, allowing users to freely change their viewing perspective. This tool con- centrates on the exploratory analysis of the data, by analyz- ing the internal structure of the dataset, its inherent internal relationships, and the patterns among data inferred by the mining algorithm.

3 Related work  In this section we describe our data mining approach to deal with spatio-temporal datasets. We start with a review of the current state-of-the art in this field, and then we present our solution.

Numerous research projects on spatial data mining have been conducted in the last two decades [3]. Some attention has been dedicated to the application of existing as well as the development of new mechanisms to extract relevant in- formation from large data repositories. However, due to the huge volume and diverse nature of this kind of data, tradi- tional techniques such as statistical methods are inadequate to elicit complex spatial and temporal relationships among data.

Most of the approaches used in current research projects are based on clustering and association rules [10, 18]. Clus- tering techniques are used to group objects, based on their special parameters or some notion of distance or similarity measure. In traditional clustering the similarity measure of- ten depends on the distance between objects or their land surface types. The most popular clustering technique is k- means [1]. Several of its variants were also developed to improve the quality of the clusters [19, 14, 6]. Moreover, there are many other clustering techniques based on dif- ferent principles including DENCLUE [20], BIRCH [15], and Chameleon [8]. These algorithms deal only with spa- tial correlations and cannot be directly used for discover- ing temporal patterns simultaneously. Furthermore they are very computationally expensive and usually trapped into lo- cal minima, as they tend to concentrate on local features [7].

Association rules have been used successfully on spatial datasets. They seek to discover associations among patterns encoded within the datasets. The main idea is to design spa- tial association rules that not only can find local correlations between patterns, but also global ones [11]. Spatial associ- ation rules constitute an improvement over generalization- based spatial data-mining methods (as the latter cannot dis- cover rules reflecting spatial pattern structures). These tech- niques have the advantages of being very powerful, using simple computations, and dealing with different types of at- tributes simultaneously [17]. However they have exponen- tial growth as the problem size increases, depend highly on the model used to represent and determine the items, and have difficulties in identifying items that only occur rarely [12, 21].

Most efforts have been spent in trying to adapt, modify or improve conventional techniques, relying on a solid KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Database) experience to design new suitable mining models. As detailed in [17], this ap- proach usually materializes in either embedding temporal awareness in spatial systems or accommodating space into temporal data mining system. Similarly, in [2, 6] an exten-     sion of existing OLAP systems with additional components and/or layers to treat geo-referenced data is presented. De- spite some good results, a flaw of this method is the lack of a clear discernment on how to consider space and time: it simply manages to handle them without really exploit- ing their characteristics during the analysis. Some good attempts have been made in proposing a more meaningful data format to highlight spatio-temporal relationships prior to elaboration; this can be achieved either by pre-processing the database [5] or by imposing a level of meta-data to prop- erly access information within the whole dataset [4].

In this paper we propose a new approach for spatio- temporal data mining that consists of two main components: a localiser and a miner. The localiser deals with the data attributes and especially with spatial and temporal dimen- sions. The miner processes the data based on the spatio- temporal relationships provided by the localiser. By dif- ferentiating the two tasks, the computations are simple and quick as they are done locally. The output of the miner (as- sociation rules) is also fed to the localiser for further im- provement. Unlike conventional approaches, in which the interactivity is inexistent or reduced to a minimum (very few simple operations), our approach is interactive as the two processes can run concurrently. This approach also differs from IDM in the sense that the processes of min- ing/analyzing the data and visualization are quite separate, as to facilitate the testing and evaluation of different algo- rithms and techniques involved in each individual phase.

4 Spatio-temporal Data Mining  Spatial datasets are more complex than conventional data.

This complexity is not only in processing and interpreting the data but is also present in the data mining input. Spatial data is usually characterized by two different types of at- tributes: spatial and non-spatial attributes. The former type identifies the spatial locations of spatial items. These in- clude 3D space coordinates, item shape, geometry, etc. The latter is usually the same as in conventional datasets, such as item name, item key, type, rate, size, etc. The main dif- ference between these two types of attributes is that the rela- tionships between spatial patterns/items are often implicit, while they are usually explicit in non-spatial objects.

Usually the pre-processing phase depends directly on the technique used to mine and analyze the data. For instance, association rules are designed to work with categorical data.

Data preparation, in this case, consists of discretizing nu- meric data into ordinal categories.

In this study, we developed a technique to categorize data based on the sampling technique described in [17]. The main difference resides in the predefined goals. Our tech- nique, called DataNarrower, is designed to properly cate- gorize the variables or attribute values, while the sampling  technique developed in [17], aims at reducing the database activity by analyzing a randomly chosen sample and then generalizing the result to the whole database. Our tech- nique also takes into account the fact that many variables never cover all the range of values allowed (e.g. after split- ting the domain of a variable into 100 intervals, we observe that 98% of values fall in the first interval).

The model used here consists of mapping the spatial datasets onto a virtual partitioned space. This can be seen as a layer in which original data is aggregated into virtual points (partitions) representing the minimal spatial unit that can be occupied by a spatio-temporal entity. Each virtual point is identified by a set of attributes including coordi- nates, size, neighbourhood, etc. For instance, traditional geographical databases have two or three dimensions, while in spatio-temporal datasets the number of dimensions can range from two (one spatial and one temporal dimension), to N (time, three spatial dimensions, n virtual dimensions).

The points are disjoint; therefore, any shape used to imple- ment a virtual point should satisfy disjunctive and comple- ment properties. This model allows us to overcome prob- lems of heterogeneity and extend the concept of items (vir- tual points) to the majority of spatio-temporal datasets.

In the proposed system we focus on developing a technique based on association rules to discover relationships between spatial patterns. A spatial association rule is of the form A ? B(s%, c%), where the pattern A is called antecedent and B consequent, and the percentages s and c are called the support and the confidence of the rule [5, 1]. The prob- lem of discovering association rules consists of identifying all rules, within the dataset, satisfying minimum support s and confidence c. This usually requires a solution to the following two sub-problems: 1) find frequent (large) spatial patterns; 2) extract strong spatial association rules. In the first problem the rules should satisfy a minimum support (support > s) and in the second a spatial association is said to be strong if it satisfies a minimum confidence (confidence > c).

To mine spatial association rules we developed a technique based on the Apriori algorithm [13], which is based on the rule: any subset of a frequent itemset must be frequent. The association rule extraction is based on the key concept of spatial itemset. According to the model defined above for spatio-temporal datasets, each itemset is associated with a set of virtual points. We say that a virtual point supports an itemset if and only if the itemset is frequent at that point.

Note that virtual points supporting the rule (or itemset) can cover more than one time step, thus extending the model to include patterns with well-defined time interval. As the traditional Apriori algorithm has a very high computational complexity, it is not suitable for very large datasets. The idea is to reduce the size of the input data by presenting the algorithm only with higher spatio-temporal relationship;     namely virtual points. Therefore, by exploiting the features of spatio-temporal datasets and by reducing the size of can- didate generation performed by the localiser, the adapted Apriori algorithm is efficient. The output of the algorithm consists of frequent itemsets and strong association rules.

Basically, two itemsets can be united if they share all the items except one. A further control is needed to verify that the intersection of the sets of virtual points referred to by the two itemsets is not empty. Indeed, such intersection be- comes the supporting area (set of virtual points) for the new itemset. This is to ensure that each new itemset has a sup- porting area, and an adequate number of virtual points.

5 Visual Techniques for Spatial Analysis  Visual Data Mining refers to methods, approaches and tools for the exploration of large datasets by allowing users to di- rectly interact with visual representations of data and dy- namically modify parameters to see how they affect the vi- sualized data. This is usually achieved by means of tech- niques from information visualization, visual perception, visual metaphors, diagrammatic reasoning, and 3D com- puter graphics [5], without requiring the decision makers to have knowledge on technicalities.

We have developed a visualization application to enable our system with various exploratory visual capabilities, meant for the different actors involved in the interactive mining process. Such an application relies on the Java3D library and is aimed at providing a 3D rendering of and interac- tion with the association rules produced by the mining al- gorithm. Our visualization tool displays in 3D the Asso- ciation Rules identified by the mining engine. Rules are intended substantially as sets of items, each identifying a range of values for a specific variable; hence displaying an item means painting an isocloud of points (a 3D scatter- plot) with the same value. The tool exploits the Arrang- ing view visualization technique [3], where two different views are presented in separated windows, and the user can arbitrarily arrange them to facilitate the comparison of data. Data are shown in two canvases, which can be rotated, zoomed and moved to easily examine shape, density and inner pits of the cloud of points. The two 3D canvases can be freely resized: for example, one can be closed, in order to allow the maximum flexibility and customization of the visualization space. The User Interface, shown in Figure 1 is composed of six main panels: AR-Extraction Panel: used to extract the rules (in XML for- mat) from the output of the mining algorithm.

Layer and Info Panel: used to set rendering styles and show detailed information about the rules. A set of radio but- tons allows the selection of the subset of points to show.

Items can be reloaded separately, with distinct display set- tings (grid/points). Log Panel: aimed at providing some  Figure 1. The graphical user interface.

textual output to the user general information on the execu- tion state of the drawing and data-fetching threads.

Antecedent Panel: a Java3D canvas, aimed at rendering the selected (active) antecedent of the current rule. This canvas has 5 Degrees of Freedom (DoF), related to mouse move- ments and button clicks.

Consequent Panel: an itemset is shown through several tabbed inner panels. Usually the Antecedent and Conse- quent panels are used complementarily to better understand and compare different layers of the visualized content.

Distribution Panel: used to render a variable of the dataset, independently of the rules involving it. It is also possible to select which timestep the data has to be fetched from (e.g., 23rd timestep).

The application has the additional capability of drawing, upon user request, the shape of a rule, intended as that par- ticular region of the space where the rule is valid, i.e., the set of locations in which the rule (hence all item involved in it) are well supported. This is useful both to highlight a given distribution restricted to a small area supporting the rule as well as the structure of any pattern embedded in the data, and to focus the user?s attention only on the subset of the dataset involved in the rule being studied. This innovative feature allows for a more efficient and light visualization process, even when displaying millions of points. Not only the content of a rule is important, but also its shape: from a domain-expert?s point of view, it might provide additional information about the behaviour of the phenomenon being studied thus being able to narrow the visualization phase only to that shape is extremely valuable in interpreting all results.

We ran some tests on a Pentium 4 2.8Ghz, equipped with 1 GB of RAM and an old GeForce 2 GTS video card to test the scalability of our application. The visualization tool was able to easily render up to 400, 000 points (200, 000 per canvas) without noticeable deterioration in the frame rate,     thus allowing the mining experts to deal with a significant amount of data.

6 A Case Study: Hurricane Isabel  We have tested our system on the Hurricane Isabel spatio-temporal dataset, produced by the Weather Re- search and Forecast (WRF) model, courtesy of NCAR, and the U.S. National Science Foundation (available at http://www.vets.ucar.edu/vg/isabeldata/). This is a substantially large spatio-temporal dataset: all variables are real-valued and were observed along 48 time steps (once every hour for 2 days), in a space having 500?500?100 = 25 ? 106 total points. Each variable, in each time step, is stored in a different file, resulting in 624 files of about 100MB each. This fine fragmentation allows great flexi- bility in choosing different subsets of data for each mining task.

Since traditional PCs are not able to handle interactively such an amount of data (more than 25 millions points, arranged on 62.5 GBytes), special techniques must be adopted to filter the data. These are usually based on some compression or sampling approach to view portions of the data. In this study we went a step further and not only pro- vided a way to visualize subsets of the data, but aimed at rendering specific patterns and relationships among them.

In the following we show results obtained by applying the  Figure 2. Rule supported by an interesting area: hur- ricane?s eye and lateral wings.

adapted Apriori algorithm to the Hurricane Isabel datasets and by viewing them with the Java3D tool described above.

We analyzed many results and report here only some of the most meaningful. In our analysis we tried to discover spe- cific patterns that were either well known about hurricane data (such as the existence of an area in the centre of the dataset, called the eye of the hurricane) or not known but of possible significance for an expert study.

Having thousands of locations in the entire space permits millions of possible different shapes for a rule. While an- alyzing results, the decisive attribute in the early screening has really been the area they covered, rather than their con- tent. In most cases, this helped to discard unimportant re- sults.

The main objective in studying hurricanes is that of predict- ing what they are going to do in the immediate future. To this aim rules providing hints about direction or strength of the hurricane are really useful. A meaningful example is given by the rule presented in Figure 2. Such a rule is sup- ported everywhere near the sea (and the land) but a narrow air flow (transversal wind component) penetrating the cloud reveals an interesting behaviour: the direction of this stream is exactly perpendicular to that of the hurricane, that at this time-step is steering north to make its landfall and proceed towards Canada. This rule presents a directional infiltration from south-west reaching exactly the eye of the hurricane (the small hole on the left). The antecedent panel provides a top view where the points representing the temperature, however quite uniform in the entire area, are not displayed to better relate the intruder to the land mass (displayed in grey).

All variables represent natural events, each with a different, and often not well defined, distribution. Figure 3 illustrates an example: the distribution of the wind variable appears almost everywhere, although with very low support. When using photographs to analyze a hurricane, all wind compo- nents are invisible; they can only be guessed by the user and thus they are not exploited in a human study; on the other hand, a normal mining process can detect such presence but is incapable of localizing it or taking into account its density with respect to space. In this situation, the method devel- oped during this work becomes very effective: it can detect only those areas reporting a sufficient number of points hav- ing large values for that phenomenon. Actually, this process of selection applies a light form of compression to the data describing the event, that is much faster than punctual data mining (i.e. rules pointing to single points instead of small locations: non-feasible in most cases).

7 Conclusions & Future Work  This paper describes our system for exploratory spatio- temporal data mining including a visualization tool for viewing and interacting with the results of the mining pro- cess. The system offers much scope for enhancements and     further developments. For example, we plan to add an in- dication of the strength of a rule in each location, changing dynamically the support to obtain larger or more exact rule.

We will investigate modelling association rules involving different areas for the antecedent and consequent. For what concerns the pre-processing step, we will analyse the user of a new technique for narrowing the variable?s domain in non-uniform intervals. We also would like to consider addi- tional derived values (like distance from the eye of the hur- ricane, total wind speed, etc.) for a more extensive analysis.
