I. INTRODUCTION  Recently medical tourism is becoming more popular, as more people realize its benefits. The main benefits of health tourism include getting the opportunity to travel to an exotic destination and reaping potentially big monetary savings [8]. In ?Industrial Manpower Package for Three-year Head-start Project of Taiwan?s Economic Development Visions for 2015? [1], Ubiquitous Healthcare (U-Health) is meaned it has more commercial potential in Taiwan in the future. Therefore, Taiwan Medical Tourism Development Association (TMTDA) was established to research and hold relevant medical tourism activities in August 2007. However, to date, there are only a  few decision support systems (DSS) to provide Medical Tourism Service (MTS) recommendation.

This paper provides an overview of the medical tourism service recommend in semantic web, combines the technical application of the SOA, OWL-S, semantic web on information system, the system gives strong auxiliary utility to support users while they have some complex problem. The designed Situation-Aware Medical Tourism Service Search System (SAMTS3) is a five-tier system composed of the Mobile Users (MUs), UDDI Registries (UDDIRs), Medical Tourism Service Providers (MTSPs), Medical Tourism Services Server (MTSS), and Database Server (DS). Using SOA, OWL-S to build semantic web environment to inference user?s requirements and search various web services which are published in UDDI through the communication networks include internet and mobile networks. In this paper, we propose the specific Medical Tourism Stemming Mechanism (MTSM) and Medical Ontologies (MOs) using OWL-S combined Adaptive Medical Tourism Service Inference Module (AMTSIM) which is composed of Term Frequency ? Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), and k?Nearest Neighbor (kNN) to reference the adaptable MTS to MUs.



II. RELATED WORK  Design Situation-Aware Medical Tourism Service Search System (SAMTS3) is to provide (i) user?s requirement inference, (ii) Medical Tourism Service (MTS) decision support, (iii) searching and inference performance. Necessary research background and relevant technology include as follows: (1) Semantic Web (SW) and (2) Requirement Classification Techniques.

A. Semantic Web (SW)  To solve the problem of lacking effective service query mechanism in existing web services, a SW based technology based web services query mechanism was proposed by Tim Berner-Lee whose proposed vision [12].

1) Semantic Inference     For inference user?s requirement semantically, Ora Lassila and James Hendler [10] proposed a architecture of SW applications based on RDF, with patterns in which one component uses another as a data source (via SPARQL) and acts as a data source to yet another component. However, RDF and RDF schema provide properties and syntax not completely to build ontology architecture. In this paper, we use the OWL-S which is an OWL-based Web service ontology that supplies web service providers with a core set of markup language constructs for describing the properties and capabilities of Web ser-vices in unambiguous, computer-interpretable form.

2) System Performance For efficient selection of QoS-aware web service, in  reference [6], we can know the inquiry API of JUDDI has better performance than JWSDP (Java Web Services Development Pack). And there were some approaches proposed by reference [7, 15], which used ?cache? mechanism for reducing process and queries while service broker inferences  QoS-aware web services. Therefore, we choice JUDDI to build SAMTS3 with ?cache? mechanism to provide SW services.

B. Requirement Classification Techniques  To date, there are various requirement classification systems which are proposed and implemented. In general, those systems consist of the following steps: (1) Preprocessing, (2) Constructing a set of centroid-sentences as training data for each topic category, and (3) Learning classifier [16].

The main roles of preprocessing are (i) segmenting requirements into sentences and (ii) extracting content word [16]. For Chinese, the CKIP group develops the Chinese segmentation system which includes the methods for resolving unknown words [14] is very useful. Although, these approaches are serviceable, they have lower power for special domain such as medical tourism in this case. For example, the  sentence ? ? which there are four segments ?  (Na)?, ? (V_2)?, ? (Nf)?, and ? (Na)? of is a specific  technicality.

In step (2), it focus on (i) generating a keyword list for each category, (ii) extracting keyword sentences, and (iii) measuring word and sentence similarities [16]. For measuring similarities, there are two kinds of approaches proposed which are corpus- based semantic similarity (CBSS) and ontology-based semantic similarity (OBSS). The basic idea of CBSS is the similarity of two words w1 and w2 can be calculated through the two distributions P(C | w1) and P(C | w2), where C is the union of the w1 and w2 context features, which in the simplest form would be words that co-occur in a corpus with w1 and w2 [4].

However, CBSS can?t support to semantically classify ontological concepts, but OBSS. In this paper, SAMTS3 will apply OBSS to use the hierarchy of the ontology to calculate the distance between two concepts.

For classifier, there are many kinds of classification techniques such as k?Nearest Neighbor (kNN) [9], clustering, and association rule. In [9], Naohiro et al. propose a new combining method which for consists of Latent Semantic Analysis followed by the kNN the documents classification.

Although, this result of combining method is the higher accuracy, the method only considers with the positive influence factors. We will consider the positive and negative influence factors to improve the inference algorithm.

The architecture of Situation-Aware Medical Tourism Service  Search System  A. Mobile Users (MUs)  MUs provide the functions that include AMTS, Customized Service (CS), and Heterogeneous Networks (HN). MUs use mobile device to request their medical requirements to SAMTS3, in order to carry on the inference of MTS by MTSS using MBS and Semantic Inference Module (SIM).

B. UDDI Registries (UDDIRs)  The aim of semantic web is to locate services automatically based on the functionalities Web services provide. UDDI is helpful to discovery web services with semantic web.

Therefore, we use the JUDDI to build UDDI environment which provides Business Entities, Service Entities, Binding Templates, and tModels to represent the detail of business and its services.

C. Medical Tourism Service Providers (MTSPs)  Medical Tourism Service Providers (MTSPs) build SOAP environment such as AXIS2 to provider some services for user invocation. After building services, MTSPs can publish the information of business, services, and binding templates to UDDIRs.

D. Medical Tourism Services Server (MTSS)  The Medical Tourism Services Server (MTSS) offers the relevant services of MTS semantic search, those services compose of the IAs and MBS.

1) Intelligent Agents (IAs): The IAs proceed such function  as collection of the materials, searching, classifying, dealing  with work, etc., the work can let users get the most MTS     automatically. The intelligent agent system includes User  Interface Agent, User Requirement Agent, and SRA.

a) User Interface Agent (UIA): To know that user?s equipment type, when the users login in and give them the  proper webpage.

b) User Requirement Inference Agent (URIA): To collect the user?s requirement, such as query, operation, search  history, and canned query, the information will be transmitted to the Medical Tourism Service Inference Agent (MTSIA) the  DS in order to let the inference engine to analyze and  recommend in advance.

c) Service Retrieval Agent (SRA): In traditional, the semantic web combined UDDI takes a long time to do the  hierar-chical queries such as find_business(), find_service(),  find_binding(), and find_tModel(). Therefore, we design the  SRA to separate service information of huge quantity in UDDI to the Web Services Cache (WSC) in Database Server, in order  to save the time for accessing various UDDIRs by complex  queries while MBS analyze the user?s requirements. SRA  which is allowed an accelerated lookup process for finding the  best match for users and their requirements is powerful to  reduce the UDDI query processes to pro-vide a brilliant  performance in the MTS inference. When MBS return the  result, SRA will recommend MTS and invoke that service after  user?s submission.

2) Model Base System (MBS): First, the MTS are  established automatically by the system, and the Medical  Tourism Service Inference Agent (MTSIA) will recommend  information to MUs for relevant services. The MBS provides  MTSIA, Semantic Inference Module (SIM), Adaptive Medical  Tourism Service Inference Module (AMTSIM), and other  extension modules. The SIM is combined specific Medical  Tour-ism Stemming Mechanism (MTSM), Medical Ontology  (MO), and OWL-S standard to inference and translate the  original sentences to be machine readable. And the AMTSIM  uses the TF - IDF, LSA, and kNN to calculate the similarity  and inference the adaptive MTS.

a) Medical Tourism Service Inference Agent (MTSIA): First, MTSIA should be trained to find the relation between  infirmities and therapies through SIM, AMTSIM, and training  data from experts? suggestions shown as Fig. 2. SIM will  translate each expert?s suggestion to be a machine readable  matrix and use MTSM, MO, and OWL-S standard to get  conception matrix for inference. Second, AMTSIM will  combine TF - IDF and LSA, and conception matrix to increase  the accuracy. Final, when MUs request, user?s requirement will  be sent from MTSIA to SIM, and SIM translate the medical requirement to be a conception matrix for calculating the  similarity between user?s requirement matrix and symptoms  matrix to find the adaptive therapy by kNN.

b) Semantic Inference Module (SIM): The Semantic Inference Module (SIM) exploits MTSM and MO to explain  and to represent the data of expert?s suggestions and user?s  requirement.

Figure 2. Medical tourism knowledge training process of MBS  (i) Preprocess  Preprocess translate the different expert?s suggestions and user?s requirements to be the vector space model. During training time, the collection of therapy suggestions as a set of documents will be represented by a word-by-document matrix A1 and A2, where each entry represents the occurrences of a infirmity as a word in a document, i.e. A1 = {afin |  NnIi ?? , }, where afin is the frequency of the infirmity i in the therapy n. Let I be the number of the occurrence of all the infirmities in those therapies and N be the number of the occurrence of all the collected therapies.

Where A2 = {awin | NnIi ?? , }, where awin is the influence weight of the infirmity i in the therapy n and  awin = 1 , if therapy n will influence infirmity i in positively.

awin = 0 , if therapy n won?t influence infirmity i.

awin = -1, if therapy n will influence infirmity i in negatively.

(ii) Medical Tourism Stemming Mechanism (MTSM)  To date, there are many stemming algorithms such as Brute Force Algorithms, Suffix Stripping Algorithms, Lemmatization Algorithms, and etc [13]. In this paper, we propose the Medical Tourism Stemming Mechanism based on CKIP segmentation system to process the special domain sentences referred to statistics and those algorithms. In addition to the affix-rules, a number of special conditions have to be designed to cover some specific medical tourism. The matrix A1 and A2 will be decreased their dimension and became as follow.

S1 = {sfjn | NnJj ?? , }, where sfjn is the frequency of the word j which is replaced from several infirmities i in the therapy n through stemming. And J is the number of the word  j, where J ? I.

S2 = {swjn | NnJj ?? , }, where swjn is the influence  weight of the word j which is replaced from several infirmities i in the therapy n through stemming.

(iii) Medical Ontology (MO) and OWL-S Standard     The Medical Ontology (MO) focuses on medical classification, medical hierarchical architecture, and medical conception retrieval. We use the data of SOHO?s Medical Directory [11] to design MO which includes domain layer, category layer, concept layer, and extended subclass layer.

There are multiple layers in MO, and we can get the best through comparing the different results from getting different levels of layer in MO. In this paper, we get the concept layer in MO to retrieve medical conception to reduce the dimension of matrix. The matrix S1 and S2 will be decreased their dimension and became as follow.

O1 = {ofkn | NnKk ?? , }, where ofkn is the frequency of the concept k which is replaced from several words j in the therapy n through MO conception retrieval. And K is the  number of the concepts k, where K ? J.

O2 = {owkn | NnKk ?? , }, where owkn is the influence  weight of the concept k which is replaced from several concepts k in the therapy n through MO conception retrieval.

c) Adaptive Medical Tourism Service Inference Module (AMTSIM): Adaptive Medical Tourism Service Inference Module combines Term Frequency ? Inversed Document  Frequency (TF - IDF), Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), and  kNN algorithm to inference adaptable MTS.

(i) Term Frequency ? Inversed Document Frequency  Salton and McGill [2] proposed that in order to decide the importance and representation of a term in a document, the TF in this document and the frequency of this term that appears in other documents can be calculated, which is called IDF. In this paper, we will calculate the TF ? IDF values of matrix O1 into the matrix T.

T = {tfkn | NnKk ?? , }, where tfkn is the TFIDF value of the concept k which is replaced from matrix O1.

?=  ?==  )( log  )(),(),(  kDF  N of  kIDFnkTFnkTFIDFtf  kn  kn  ,  where TFIDF(k, n) is the weight of concept k in the therapy n , DF(k) is the frequency of concept k in the therapy set, and  NnKk ?? , .

Final, we also consider the negative influence between  infirmity and therapy to calculate the matrix L.

Where L = 2OT ?  = { knknkn owtflf ?= | NnKk ?? , }  (ii) Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)  We then perform Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to  L. The SVD of L is defined as L = ?UZV , where U is a  rK ?  matrix of left singular vectors, Z is a rr ?  diagonal  matrix of singular values, and V is a Nr ?  matrix of right singular vectors. ),min( NKr ?  is rank of L [5].

The process of dimension reduction is applied to Z by deleting a few entries in it, and the result of dimension reduction is a matrix Z? which is a pp ?  matrix. Let Z?, where rp ? , be the diagonal matrix formed from the top k singular values, and let U? and V? be the matrices produced by selecting corresponding columns from U and V. A new matrix, L?, is reconstructed by multiplying three component matrixes, in the sense that it minimizes the approximation errors.

LNnKklfVZUL kn ???== ? },|'{''''  (iii) k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN)  In this paper, a medical tourism inference model is trained by MTSM, MO, TF ? IDF, and LSA through different expert?s suggestions into the matrix L? for inference. When MUs input their requirement, the SIM will translate the requirement to matrix Q on concept layer by MTSM and MO, and the AMTSIM will use the matrix L? to classify the requirement into the adaptive therapy by kNN. The algorithm for the kNN is as follows,  i) Let the user?s requirement be a matrix Q on concept layer  by MTSM, MO, and TF - IDF, where Q = {qfk | Kk ? }, where qfk is the TFIDF value of the infirmity concept k, and of(k, q) is the term frequency of infirmity requirement in concept k.

?= )(  log),( kDF  N ofqf qkk  , if user has infirmity i of  concept k.

qfk = 0 , otherwise.

ii) We also consider the negative influence between infirmity and therapy to calculate the similarity of the matrix Q and matrix L? as follows,  2 1  2 2   [( ) ' ]( ) ' ( , ' )  ' [( ) ( ' ) ]  K  k kn knn k n  K n k kn knk  qf ow lfQ O L sim Q L  Q O L qf ow lf  =  =  ? ?? ?= = ? ? ? ?  where NnKk ?? , and 1)',(0 ?? nLQsim  iii) The requirement matrix Q is assigned to the therapy class through kNN of Q.

E. Database Server (DS)  The server offers the web services properties and user requirements to store, and it is a powerful application tool to provide information to MTSS for MTS inference.



IV. EVALUATION  There are 46 expert?s suggestions (such as therapy 1, therapy 2, ? , therapy 46) in the domain of medical tourism, and those data are collected from several web sites which are all provided by hospitals or doctors. We measure the     performance of our approach in the way called k-fold cross- validation [3]. In our experiments, training and testing are performed 46 times (i.e., k = 46). In iteration m, therapy m is selected as the test corpus, and the other therapies are collectively used to train the values for each infirmity.

In this experiment, the feasibility of applying Medical Tourism Stemming Mechanism, Medical Ontology, or Latent Semantic Analysis to MTS requirement classification is evaluated. Table 1 and 2 show classification index in kNN combined with MTSM, MO, or LSA. Consider kNN first; it can be observed that it?s performances of classification are 50.00%, 75.00%, 50.00%, 41.18%, and 60.00% when the classes are ?Air Bath?, ?Thermal Spring?, ?Sulfate Spring?, ?Carbon Dioxide Spring?, and ?Salt Spring?. The result shows that kNN algorithm combined MTSM, MO, and LSA to improve accuracy rates. Although, MO does not guarantee the obtained the most adaptable matrix always performs well for the MTS recommendations. For example, when kNN + MTSM + MO + LSA are combined, the performance of ?Salt Spring? de-clines. In view of macro-average, there is a higher accuracy rate about 73.91% from the best combination of approaches which are kNN + MTSM + MO + LSA. Therefore, we apply kNN with MTSM, MO, and LSA in SAMTS3.

V. CONCLUSION  Recently there has a few medical tourism systems developed which mostly focus on location-aware service but no medical tourism service recommendation in Taiwan. In this research, we proposed a Situation-Aware Medical Tourism Service Search System, which provides user?s requirements inference and relative services search by semantic inference engine and find the most adaptive Medical Tourism Service.

We discover the accuracy of the MTS inference is higher by combining Medical Tourism Stemming Mechanism, Medical Ontology, Term Frequency ? Inversed Document Frequency, Latent Semantic Analysis, and k-Nearest Neighbor. Mobile  users can conveniently obtain customized MTS and decision to get and use those services according to their health requirement in advance by SAMTS3. In the future, the MO can be modified to store more levels of medical tourism and other domain knowledge. For requirement classification, the similarity is computed by different level of MO to get adaptable medical tourism service from different industries.
