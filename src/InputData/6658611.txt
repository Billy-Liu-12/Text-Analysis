WELCOME	 ?TO	 ?MSC	 ?2013	 ? 	 ? HYDERABAD	 ?  2	 ?  ?  Welcome	 ?from	 ?the	 ?General	 ?Co-?Chairs	 ? ?  We	 ?take	 ?pleasure	 ? in	 ?welcoming	 ?delegates	 ? to	 ? the	 ?2013	 ? IEEE	 ?Multi-??Conference	 ?on	 ?Systems	 ?and	 ?Control,	 ? which	 ? is	 ?being	 ?held	 ? in	 ? India	 ?for	 ?the	 ?first	 ?time.	 ? 	 ?We	 ?are	 ?grateful	 ?to	 ?the	 ?IEEE	 ?Control	 ?Systems	 ?Society	 ?for	 ?  awarding	 ?this	 ?prestigious	 ?event	 ?to	 ?India	 ?and	 ?hope	 ?that	 ?the	 ?event	 ?lives	 ?up	 ?to	 ?everyone's	 ?expectations.	 ?  Hyderabad	 ? is	 ? the	 ? sixth	 ? largest	 ? city	 ? by	 ? population	 ? and	 ? the	 ? second	 ? largest	 ? city	 ? by	 ? area	 ? in	 ? India.	 ? 	 ? By	 ? tradition,	 ?Hyderabad	 ?is	 ?deemed	 ?to	 ?have	 ?been	 ?"founded"	 ?in	 ?1591	 ?with	 ?the	 ?construction	 ?of	 ?the	 ?Charminar,	 ? the	 ? four-??minaret	 ? structure	 ? that	 ? is	 ?perhaps	 ? the	 ?most	 ? recognizable	 ? landmark	 ?of	 ? the	 ? city.	 ? 	 ?However,	 ? the	 ?  region	 ?was	 ? inhabited	 ?for	 ?centuries	 ?prior	 ?to	 ?that.	 ? 	 ? In	 ?olden	 ?days,	 ?before	 ?1591,	 ?the	 ?area	 ?was	 ?famous	 ?for	 ? both	 ?diamonds	 ?as	 ?well	 ?as	 ?fresh	 ?water	 ?pearls.	 ?	 ?The	 ?famous	 ?Koh-??i-??Noor,	 ?which	 ?is	 ?certainly	 ?the	 ?oldest	 ?and	 ? one	 ?of	 ?the	 ?largest	 ?diamonds	 ?ever,	 ? is	 ?from	 ?this	 ?area.	 ?	 ?Hyderabad	 ?is	 ?also	 ?known	 ?as	 ?the	 ?"pearl	 ?city,"	 ?even	 ?  though	 ?most	 ?of	 ? the	 ?pearls	 ? sold	 ?here	 ?nowadays	 ?are	 ? imported	 ? in	 ?bulk	 ? from	 ?Japan,	 ? then	 ?sorted	 ?by	 ?color	 ? and	 ?weight,	 ?and	 ?finally	 ?arranged	 ?into	 ?necklaces.	 ?	 ?During	 ?the	 ?past	 ?twenty	 ?years,	 ?when	 ?India	 ?made	 ?its	 ?mark	 ? on	 ? the	 ?world's	 ? IT	 ? scene,	 ?Hyderabad	 ?has	 ? played	 ? a	 ?major	 ? role,	 ? regularly	 ? ranking	 ? among	 ? the	 ? top	 ? two	 ?or	 ?  three	 ?cities	 ?in	 ?terms	 ?of	 ?IT	 ?exports.	 ?  This	 ?year's	 ?MSC	 ?lives	 ?up	 ?to	 ?the	 ?size	 ?and	 ?scope	 ?of	 ?earlier	 ?meetings.	 ?	 ?It	 ?consists	 ?of	 ?three	 ?meetings:	 ?CACSD	 ? (Conference	 ? on	 ? Computer-??Aided	 ? Control	 ? System	 ? Design	 ? and	 ? Systems	 ? with	 ? Uncertainty),	 ? CCA	 ? (Conference	 ?on	 ?Control	 ?Applications),	 ?and	 ?ISIC	 ?(International	 ?Symposium	 ?on	 ?Intelligent	 ?Control).	 ?	 ?A	 ?total	 ?  of	 ?358	 ?papers	 ?were	 ?submitted,	 ?out	 ?of	 ?which	 ?240	 ?were	 ?accepted	 ?and	 ?214	 ?were	 ?finally	 ?uploaded.	 ?	 ?The	 ?CCA	 ? makes	 ? up	 ? the	 ? bulk	 ? of	 ? the	 ? papers,	 ? accounting	 ? for	 ? roughly	 ? 80%	 ? of	 ? the	 ? total,	 ? with	 ? CACSD	 ? and	 ? ISIC	 ? comprising	 ? roughly	 ?10%	 ?each.	 ? 	 ? In	 ?addition	 ? to	 ? the	 ?contributed	 ?papers,	 ? several	 ?exciting	 ?plenary	 ? lectures	 ?  have	 ?also	 ?been	 ?arranged.	 ?  Once	 ?again,	 ?we	 ?welcome	 ?one	 ?and	 ?all	 ?to	 ?the	 ?MSC	 ?2013	 ?and	 ?wish	 ?everyone	 ?a	 ?successful	 ?stay!	 ?     ? ?  ? 	 ? M.	 ?Vidyasagar	 ? General	 ?Chair	 ?

Sensor	 ?Fault	 ?Detection	 ?and	 ?Isolation	 ?in	 ?Big	 ?Data	 ?Environments1	 ? Marios	 ?M.	 ?Polycarpou	 ?  ?  The	 ?emergence	 ?of	 ?networked	 ?embedded	 ?systems	 ?and	 ?sensor/actuator	 ?networks	 ?  has	 ?given	 ? rise	 ? to	 ?advanced	 ?monitoring	 ?and	 ? control	 ? applications,	 ?where	 ?a	 ? large	 ? amount	 ? of	 ? sensor	 ? data	 ? is	 ? collected	 ? and	 ? processed	 ? in	 ? real-??time	 ? in	 ? order	 ? to	 ? achieve	 ? smooth	 ? and	 ? efficient	 ? operation	 ?of	 ? the	 ?underlying	 ? system.	 ? The	 ? current	 ?  trend	 ?is	 ?towards	 ?larger	 ?and	 ?larger	 ?sensor	 ?data	 ?sets,	 ?leading	 ?to	 ?so	 ?called	 ?big	 ?data	 ? environments.	 ?However,	 ? in	 ?situations	 ?where	 ? faults	 ?arise	 ? in	 ?one	 ?or	 ?more	 ?of	 ? the	 ? sensing	 ?devices,	 ?this	 ?may	 ?lead	 ?to	 ?a	 ?serious	 ?degradation	 ?in	 ?performance	 ?or	 ?even	 ?  to	 ? an	 ? overall	 ? system	 ? failure.	 ? The	 ? goal	 ? of	 ? this	 ? presentation	 ? is	 ? to	 ? motivate	 ? the	 ? need	 ? for	 ? fault	 ? diagnosis	 ? in	 ? complex	 ? distributed	 ? dynamical	 ? systems	 ? and	 ? to	 ? provide	 ? a	 ?methodology	 ? for	 ? detecting	 ?and	 ?isolating	 ?multiple	 ?sensor	 ?faults	 ?in	 ?a	 ?class	 ?of	 ?nonlinear	 ?dynamical	 ?systems.	 ?The	 ?detection	 ?of	 ?  faults	 ? in	 ? sensor	 ? groups	 ? is	 ? conducted	 ? using	 ? robust	 ? analytical	 ? redundancy	 ? relations,	 ? formulated	 ? by	 ? structured	 ? residuals	 ? and	 ? adaptive	 ? thresholds.	 ? Various	 ? estimation	 ? algorithms	 ? will	 ? be	 ? presented	 ? and	 ? illustrated,	 ?and	 ?directions	 ?for	 ?future	 ?research	 ?will	 ?be	 ?discussed.	 ?	 ?

There	 ?has	 ?been	 ?remarkable	 ?progress	 ? in	 ?sampled-??data	 ?control	 ?theory	 ? in	 ?the	 ? last	 ? two	 ?decades.	 ?The	 ?main	 ?achievement	 ?here	 ?is	 ?that	 ?there	 ?exists	 ?a	 ?digital	 ?(discrete-?? time)	 ?control	 ? law	 ?that	 ?takes	 ?the	 ? inter-??sample	 ?behavior	 ? into	 ?account	 ?and	 ?makes	 ?  the	 ?overall	 ?analog	 ?(continuous-??time)	 ?performance	 ?optimal,	 ?in	 ?the	 ?sense	 ?of	 ?the	 ?H-?? infinity	 ?norm.	 ?This	 ?naturally	 ? suggests	 ? its	 ? application	 ? to	 ?digital	 ? signal	 ?processing	 ? where	 ?the	 ?same	 ?hybrid	 ?nature	 ?of	 ?analog	 ?and	 ?digital	 ?is	 ?always	 ?prevalent.	 ?A	 ?crucial	 ?  observation	 ?here	 ?is	 ?that	 ?the	 ?perfect	 ?band-??limiting	 ?hypothesis,	 ?widely	 ?accepted	 ?in	 ? signal	 ?processing,	 ? is	 ?often	 ? inadequate	 ?for	 ?many	 ?practical	 ?situations.	 ? In	 ?practice,	 ?  the	 ?original	 ?analog	 ?signals	 ?(sounds,	 ? images,	 ?etc.)	 ?are	 ?neither	 ?fully	 ?band	 ?limited	 ?nor	 ?even	 ?close	 ?to	 ?being	 ? band	 ?limited	 ?under	 ?the	 ?current	 ?processing	 ?standards.	 ?	 ?

Thursday,	 ?August	 ?29,	 ?2013	 ? 09:30?10:30am	 ?  Hall	 ?2,	 ?Ground	 ?Floor,	 ?HICC	 ? In	 ?many	 ? problems	 ? in	 ? optimal	 ? and	 ? robust	 ? control,	 ? one	 ? has	 ? to	 ? solve	 ? global	 ?  optimization	 ? problems	 ? P	 ? of	 ? the	 ? form:	 ? f*	 ? =	 ? min	 ? {	 ? f(x)	 ? :	 ? x	 ? ?	 ? K},	 ? or,	 ? equivalently,	 ?f*	 ?=	 ?max{?	 ?:	 ?f	 ??	 ??	 ??	 ?0	 ?on	 ?K},	 ?where	 ?f	 ?is	 ?a	 ?polynomial	 ?(or	 ?even	 ?a	 ? semi-??algebraic	 ?function)	 ?and	 ?K	 ? is	 ?a	 ?basic	 ?semi-??algebraic	 ?set.	 ?One	 ?may	 ?even	 ?  need	 ? to	 ? solve	 ? the	 ? ?robust?	 ? version	 ?min{f(x)	 ? :	 ? x	 ??	 ? K;	 ? h(x;	 ? u)	 ? ?	 ? 0,	 ??u	 ??	 ?U}	 ? where	 ?U	 ? is	 ?a	 ?set	 ?of	 ?parameters.	 ?For	 ? instance,	 ?some	 ?static	 ?output	 ?feedback	 ?  problems	 ?can	 ?be	 ?cast	 ?as	 ?polynomial	 ?optimization	 ?problems	 ?whose	 ?feasible	 ? set	 ? K	 ? is	 ? defined	 ? by	 ? a	 ? polynomial	 ?matrix	 ? inequality	 ? (PMI).	 ? Likewise,	 ? robust	 ?  stability	 ? regions	 ? of	 ? linear	 ? systems	 ? can	 ? be	 ? modeled	 ? as	 ? parameterized	 ? polynomial	 ? matrix	 ? inequalities	 ?  (PMIs)	 ? where	 ? parameters	 ? u	 ? account	 ? for	 ? uncertainties	 ? and	 ? (decision)	 ? variables	 ? x	 ? are	 ? the	 ? controller	 ? coefficients.	 ? Therefore,	 ? to	 ? solve	 ? such	 ? problems	 ? one	 ? needs	 ? tractable	 ? characterizations	 ? of	 ? polynomials	 ? (and	 ?even	 ?semi-??algebraic	 ?functions)	 ?which	 ?are	 ?nonnegative	 ?on	 ?a	 ?set,	 ?a	 ?topic	 ?of	 ?independent	 ?interest	 ?and	 ?  of	 ?primary	 ?importance	 ?because	 ?it	 ?also	 ?has	 ?implications	 ?in	 ?many	 ?other	 ?areas.	 ?We	 ?will	 ?review	 ?two	 ?kinds	 ?of	 ? tractable	 ?characterizations	 ?of	 ?polynomials	 ?which	 ?are	 ?non-??negative	 ?on	 ?a	 ?basic	 ?closed	 ?semi-??algebraic	 ?set	 ?K	 ?  ?	 ?Rn.	 ?The	 ?first	 ?type	 ?of	 ?characterization	 ?is	 ?when	 ?knowledge	 ?on	 ?K	 ?is	 ?through	 ?its	 ?defining	 ?polynomials,	 ?i.e.,	 ?K	 ? =	 ?{x	 ?:	 ?gj(x)	 ??	 ?0;	 ?j	 ?=	 ?1,	 ?.	 ?.	 ?.	 ?,m},	 ?in	 ?which	 ?case	 ?some	 ?powerful	 ?certificates	 ?of	 ?positivity	 ?can	 ?be	 ?stated	 ?in	 ?terms	 ? of	 ? some	 ? sums-??of-??squares	 ? (SOS)-??weighted	 ? representation.	 ? For	 ? instance,	 ? this	 ? allows	 ? us	 ? to	 ? define	 ? a	 ? hierarchy	 ?of	 ?semi-??definite	 ?relaxations	 ?which	 ?yields	 ?a	 ?monotone	 ?sequence	 ?of	 ?lower	 ?bounds	 ?converging	 ?to	 ?  f*	 ? (and	 ? in	 ? fact,	 ? finite	 ? convergence	 ? is	 ? generic).	 ? There	 ? is	 ? also	 ? another	 ?way	 ? of	 ? looking	 ? at	 ? non-??negativity	 ? where	 ?now	 ?knowledge	 ?on	 ?K	 ?is	 ?through	 ?moments	 ?of	 ?a	 ?measure	 ?whose	 ?support	 ?is	 ?K.	 ?In	 ?this	 ?case,	 ?checking	 ? whether	 ? a	 ? polynomial	 ? is	 ? nonnegative	 ? on	 ? K	 ? reduces	 ? to	 ? solving	 ? a	 ? sequence	 ? of	 ? generalized	 ? eigenvalue	 ?  problems	 ? associated	 ? with	 ? a	 ? countable	 ? (nested)	 ? family	 ? of	 ? real	 ? symmetric	 ? matrices	 ? of	 ? increasing	 ? size.	 ? When	 ? applied	 ? to	 ? P,	 ? this	 ? results	 ? in	 ? a	 ? monotone	 ? sequence	 ? of	 ? upper	 ? bounds	 ? converging	 ? to	 ? the	 ? global	 ? minimum,	 ? which	 ? complements	 ? the	 ? previous	 ? sequence	 ? of	 ? lower	 ? bounds.	 ? These	 ? two	 ? (dual)	 ?  characterizations	 ? provide	 ? convex	 ? inner	 ? (respectively,	 ? outer)	 ? approximations	 ? (by	 ? spectrahedra)	 ? of	 ? the	 ? convex	 ?cone	 ?of	 ?polynomials	 ?nonnegative	 ?on	 ?K.	 ?

09:00-09:20 WeA01.1 Handling Fault Detection Latencies in Automata-Based Scheduling for Embedded Control Software (I), pp. 1-6  Prabhu M, Santhosh Indian Inst. of Tech. Kharagpur Hazra, Aritra Indian Inst. of Tech. Kharagpur Dasgupta, Pallab Indian Inst. of Tech. Kharagpur Chakrabarti, Partha Pratim Indian Inst. of Tech. Kharagpur  There has been recent interest in automata-based scheduling for dynamic adaptation of schedules for embedded control software.

Recently we have shown how automata-based scheduling can be extended to account for the possibility of faults in application of control. In this paper, we address the problem of automata-based scheduling when latencies are associated with detection of faults. We show that the game-theoretic approach that is used for handling faults under full visibility may be suitably augmented so as to decide the scheduling strategy in the presence of latencies in fault detection.

09:20-09:40 WeA01.2 A Mixed Approach to Rigorous Development of Control Designs (I), pp. 7-12  Satpathy, Manoranjan Indian Inst. of Tech. Bhubaneswar Ramesh, S. General Motors R&D Snook, Colin Univ. of Southampton Singh, Neeraj Kumar Univ. of York Butler, Michael Univ. of Southampton  The control law of a typical industrial system has a modulating (continuous) component and a sequential/modal component. Control engineers are traditionally good at specifying the modulating part of the control laws unambiguously, correctly and completely. Software engineers have similar skills on the sequential component. In this paper, we discuss a mixed approach in which software and control engineers collaborate to develop control designs. The proposed approach is based upon a novel modeling notation called RRM diagrams. A formal refinement method based on RRM diagrams is developed which enables the development of sequential components as well as control designs. We illustrate our method by considering the case study of a simplified Adaptive Cruise Controller (ACC).

In order to obtain resource efficient implementations of control loops on embedded platforms, recently there has been a renewed interest in studying stability and various other quality-of-control (QoC) metrics in the presence of control message drops. Towards this, different methods have been proposed to quantify the impact of message drops on stability and control performance. In this paper we will survey these techniques and clarify the relationship between them.

Given a drop pattern that satisfies stability and specified QoC constraints, it is important to check whether an implementation platform satisfies this pattern. In other words, whether the control loop in question may be implemented on this platform. Given an architecture, we will also show how certain notions of expressing drop patterns are easier to verify compared to others.

10:00-10:20 WeA01.4 Scalable Model-Checking for Precise End-To-End Latency Computation (I), pp. 19-24  Mohalik, Swarup Intel Tech. India Pvt Ltd Chokshi, Devesh B. ETH Zurich Dixit, Manoj G. MathWorks India Pvt Ltd Rajeev, A. C. MathWorks Inc Ramesh, S. General Motors R&D  Correct functionality of automotive embedded control systems often requires that the end-to-end latencies of data items traversing through specified task/message chains from sensors to actuators are within specified bounds. Hence, accurate estimation of the worst-case end- to-end latency has significant impact on the design of system architectures. Model-checking based techniques can provide accurate estimates of worst-case end-to-end latency, as they are based on exhaustive state-space exploration. However, state-space explosion may limit their applicability to small and medium sized systems. In this paper, we present an abstract system model that can be used for model-checking based latency computation, leading to a major increase in scalability. This is achieved by on-the-fly generation of abstract models for task activations, based on a proposed variant of the Joseph-Pandya equation.

10:20-10:40 WeA01.5 Improving Approximate Reachability by Dynamic Interleavings of Projections-Based Algorithms (I), pp. 25-30  Jayasankar, Seetha IIT Bombay (currently on leave) Chakraborty, Supratik IIT Bombay  Finding the set of reachable states of a digital control circuit has important applications in synthesis, analysis and verification of digital control systems. The literature contains a wide range of reachability analysis algorithms, including exact and approximate ones, with complementary or even incomparable strengths. Given a problem instance, it is practically impossible to statically identify the algorithm that would offer the best trade-off between performance and synthesis/verification objectives. In this paper, we focus on projections-based approximate reachability analysis algorithms and show that dynamically interleaving these algorithms can outperform not only the individual algorithms, but also other state-of-the-art tools.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our idea by a set of experiments.

31-34  Hashikawa, Tomoya Osaka Univ.

Fujisaki, Yasumasa Osaka Univ.

This paper deals with convergence conditions of iterative learning control (ILC) for linear time-varying plants from a unified viewpoint to    continuous-time and discrete-time cases. For a continuous-time plant, the corresponding discrete-time plant with a sampling period is obtained via delta operator. Then, a necessary and sufficient condition is given under which the tracking error of the discrete-time ILC converges to zero as the number of terations tends to infinity. A candidate of ILC convergence condition for the original continuous- time plant is readily obtained by considering the case that the sampling period tends to zero. It is in fact a sufficient condition of convergence, which is shown with a rigorous proof. The condition is based on the supremum of the set of the spectral radius of a time- varying matrix related to the feedthrough term of the plant to its differential output. It is better than any other existing conditions based on induced norm.

Jagannathan, Sarangapani Missouri Univ. of Science & Tech.

In this paper, a neural network (NN) based adaptive event-triggered control is developed for a single input and single output (SISO) uncertain nonlinear continuous time system. An explicit design of the event-triggered controller using NN approximation and feedback linearization is presented. The controller dynamics are approximated by using two single layer NNs. In addition, novel weight update laws are derived for the NNs in the context of event-triggered transmission, i.e., weights are updated only at the triggering instants, hence, aperiodic in nature. The closed loop stability analysis using Lyapunov approach for impulsive dynamical system is carried out to show the uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) of the NN weight estimation errors as well as system states. Numerical results are included for validating the design.

In this paper, finite-horizon optimal control design for affine nonlinear discrete-time systems with totally unknown system dynamics is presented. First, a novel neural network (NN)-based identifier is utilized to learn the control coefficient matrix. This identifier is used together with the action-critic-based scheme to learn the time-varying solution, or referred to as value function, of the Hamilton-Jacobi- Bellman (HJB) equation in an online and forward in time manner. To handle the time varying nature of the value function, NNs with constant weights and time-varying activation functions are considered. To satisfy the terminal constraint, an additional term is added to the novel updating law. The uniformly ultimately boundedness of the closed-loop system is demonstrated by using standard Lyapunov theory. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by simulation results.

10:00-10:20 WeA02.4 Dynamically Reoptimized SNAC Controller for Robust Wing Rock Suppression, pp. 47-52  Tiwari, Shivendra N INDIAN Inst. OF SCIENCE,MATHIKERE,BANGAL  ORE,560012 Padhi, Radhakant Indian Inst. of Science  Following the philosophy of adaptive optimal control, a new technique is presented in this paper for robust optimal regulation of a class of nonlinear systems. First, accounting for a nominal system model, a  single network adaptive critic (SNAC) based multi-layered neural network (called as NN1) is synthesized offline for optimal regulation of the nominal system. However, another linear-in-weight neural network (called as NN2) is trained online and augmented to NN1 in such a manner that their combined output represent the desired optimal costate for the actual plant. To do this, the nominal model needs to be updated online to adapt to the actual plant, which done by synthesizing yet another linear-in-weight neural network (called as NN3) online. Training of NN3 is done by utilizing the error information between the nominal and actual states and carrying out the necessary Lyapunov stability analysis using a Sobolev norm based Lyapunov function so that both the unmodelled part of the dynamics as well as its partial derivatives with respect to the states are captured. This helps in training NN2 successfully to capture the required optimal relationship. The overall architecture is named as ?Dynamically Re-optimized single network adaptive critic (DR-SNAC)'.

To demonstrate its effectiveness, the DR-SNAC technique is applied to suppress the wing rock phenomenon of slender delta wings in high angle of attack in presence of significant unmodelled dynamics and the results are quite promising.

10:20-10:40 WeA02.5 Stable Neural PID Anti-Swing Control for an Overhead Crane, pp. 53-  Cruz, Panuncio CINVESTAV-IPN Yu, Wen CINVESTAV-IPN Li, Xiaoou CINVESTAV-IPN  PD with compensation or PID are the most popular algorithms for the overhead crane control. To minimize steady-state error with respect to uncertaintie, PID control needs a big integral gain and the PD with compensator requires a large derivative gain. Both of them deteriorate transient performances of the crane control. In this paper, we propose a novel anti-swing control strategy which combines PID control with neural compensation. The main theory contributions of this paper are semiglobal asymptotic stability of the neural PID for the anti-swing control is proven with standard weights training algorithms.

The conditions give explicit selection methods for the gains of the linear PID control. A experimental study on an overhead crane with this neural PID control is addressed.

The use of the super twisting algorithm for the combustion engine air path is to achieve fault-tolerance and to enhance the chattering phenomenon.

Comparing to the adaptive sliding mode controller (ASMC), the obtained results showed good performances for actuator fault- accommodation even in the presence of uncertainties on model parameters.

09:20-09:40 WeA03.2 Feed Forward Disturbance Rejection by a Multiple FIFO Approach for Transient Operation of an Engine Test Bench, pp. 65-70  Kokal, Helmut AVL Colaneri, Patrizio Pol. di Milano Del Re, Luigi Johannes Kepler Univ. Linz Schmidt, Martin AVL    Paulweber, Michael AVL  Frequency bandwidth is a critical property of engine test benches, and is becoming the longer the more important especially in view of hybrid vehicle applications. A critical limiting factor of the bandwidth is the damping of the connection between engine and brake. To overcome this limit, a setup consisting of a stiff connection and an active rejection of the torque ripple has been proposed. Based on repeatability of a working cycle of a combustion engine, prediction and rejection of disturbance is possible for a given value of the system delay. However the delay is spread in different operating points, and its value is in general non known and subject to drastic changes during transient operations. This problem is tackled here by resorting to a time-shift adaptation based on a bank of FIFO memories along with a switching rule depending on the transient operating points - as opposed to stationary operating points. The algorithm is tested in simulation and furthermore applied to a real test bench. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

09:40-10:00 WeA03.3 Explicit Nonlinear Model Predictive Control of the Air Path of a Turbocharged Spark-Ignited Engine, pp. 71-77  El Hadef, Jamil Renault SA - Univ. of Orleans Olaru, Sorin Supelec Rodriguez-Ayerbe, Pedro Supelec Colin, Guillaume Univ. of Orleans Chamaillard, Y. PRISME / Univ. of Orleans Talon, Vincent RENAULT  Pollutant emissions and fuel economy objectives have led car manufacturers to develop innovative and more sophisticated engine layouts. In order to reduce time-to-market and development costs, recent research has investigated the idea of a quasi-systematic engine control development approach. Model based approaches might not be the only possibility but they are clearly predetermined to considerably reduce test bench tuning work requirements. In this paper, we present the synthesis of a physics-based nonlinear model predictive control law especially designed for powertrain control. A binary search tree is used to ensure real-time implementation of the explicit form of the control law, computed by solving the associated multi-parametric nonlinear problem.

This work addresses the issues of actuator fault detection and isolation for diesel engines. We are particularly interested to diagnosis faults affecting the Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) and the variable Nozzle Turbine (VNT) actuator valves. To accomplish this goal, a residual generator based on a nonlinear mean value model of the diesel engine is proposed using a bank of observer.

Each residual on the proposed scheme is based on a nonlinear unknown input observer and designed to be insensitive to only one fault. By using this kind of scheme, the actuator faults can be easily isolated since only one residual goes to zero while the others do not.

A decision algorithm based on multi-CUSUM is used. The performances of the proposed approach are shown through the application to a diesel engine model.

10:20-10:40 WeA03.5 Improved Torque Tracking on Internal Combustion Engine Test Benches Equipped with EURO 6-Engines, pp. 85-90  Stanger, Thomas Johannes Kepler Univ. Linz Passenbrunner, Thomas Ernst Johannes Kepler Univ. Linz Kokal, Helmut AVL Del Re, Luigi Johannes Kepler Univ. Linz  Test benches for internal combustion engines are used for many purposes in the automotive industry with strong advantages in terms of reproducibility and costs. The torque and the speed at the crankshaft of the engine must be tracked simultaneously to simulate the operation of an internal combustion engine in a vehicle. Single- input single-output proportional-integral-controllers are usually used to this end. Additional limitations have been introduced in the Engine Control Unit to meet the continuously strengthened emission levels.

Especially, for new engines these limitations lead to significant overshoots in the torque tracking which have to be prevented in any case.

The limitations are studied and the impacts to the tracking are analyzed in this paper. The existing proportional-integral-controller is extended based on this analysis. In particular, the controller parameters are scheduled with respect to the change of the torque reference and the tracking error. No model of the plant is required for controller design, the controller parameters can be tuned quickly and easily during the set-up of a test bench. Measurements on a test bench equipped with a passenger car Diesel engine confirm the improvements compared to the industrial standard.

The critical task of anesthesia administration demands minimal drug titration by considering patient specific features and sedation requirements. Though there exist several sedation assessment monitors, physicians still largely rely on subjective sedation scoring systems. This paper presents an optimal infusion controller for the continuous infusion of midazolam along with the analgesic fentanyl.

Specifically, we extend the convex optimization-based optimal drug dosing regimen for propofol presented in [1] to midazolam. We also propose an alternative optimization approach using the Kullback- Leibler divergence measure of two probability distributions. A stochastic pharmacodynamic model is used that utilizes the modified Ramsay sedation scoring method to link the plasma drug concentration and the effective probabilistic sedation level.

The control scheme is then implemented on four unimpaired participants supplying zero voluntary effort. Results illustrate the ability of the scheme to track the time- variance of the true plant and provide improved torque tracking compared with a fixed controller. An advantage of the proposed method is the ability to achieve similar levels of performance across multiple participants without the need to perform identification tests.

Haddad, Wassim M. Georgia Inst. of Tech.

In this paper, an output-feedback sliding mode control (SMC) for a linear multicompartment respiratory system is developed. Since the applied input pressure to the lungs is in general nonnegative and cannot be arbitrarily large, as not to damage the lungs, a sliding mode control with bounded nonnegative control inputs is proposed. The controller only uses output information (i.e., the total volume of the lungs) and automatically adjusts the applied input pressure so that the system is able to track a given reference signal in the presence of parameter uncertainty (i.e., modelling uncertainty of the lung resistances and lung compliances) and system disturbances.

Controllers for both matched and unmatched uncertainty are presented. Specifically, a Lyapunov-based approach is presented for the stability analysis of the system and the proposed control framework is applied to a two-compartment lung model to show the efficacy of the proposed control method.

This paper considers RISE control for two-degree-of-freedom (2DOF) human lower limb with antagonistic bi-articular muscles. The antagonistic bi-articular muscles straddle the waist joint and the knee joint in the lower limb. Because the nonlinear model of the lower limb of the human body is uncertain, a robust control method is developed yield semi-global asymptotic tracking. Simulation results indicate that the torques in joint 2 of the 2DOF lower limb is lower than the previous method, because of antagonistic bi-articular muscles. It is verified that the 2DOF lower limb can move to the desired position in the presence of unmodeled bounded disturbances.

Baliyarasimhuni, Sujit Univ. de Porto Postlethwaite, Ian Northumbria Univ.

This paper addresses the problem of large scale multi-agent motion planning in the presence of various uncertainties and under limited communication bandwidth. Obtaining an optimal solution while simultaneously addressing all the issues is a difficult problem.

Towards this, we develop a decentralized motion planner that combines probabilistic approaches including the rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT), chance constraint, overlapping coefficient and birthday paradox. First, we use RRT along with the chance constraint approach to identify robust paths. Second, we use the overlapping coefficient technique to detect conflicts between multiple agent paths and third, we use the birthday paradox to detect conflicts between agents in a large team under communication bandwidth constraints.

Finally, a priority based approach is employed to resolve conflicts.

These steps are carried out sequentially. To manage the level of uncertainty in the path planner, we use a closed-loop system to predict future distributions. Our paper extends the prediction approach to nonlinear Gaussian systems. We describe details of integrating these techniques to create a complete framework for determining computationally efficient paths for large scale multi-agent  systems under uncertainty.

Singh, Arun Kumar IIIT-Hyderabad Shah, Suril IIIT-Hyderabad Krishna, K. Madhava IIIT-Hyderabad  In this paper we propose a semi-active robot for climbing steep obstacles like steps,etc. The key novelty of the proposed robot lies in the use of a passive mechanism for climbing steps of smaller heights and motor only while climbing steps of greater heights. Analysis of the robot's stability during its ascent phase is also investigated. Model based control is used to achieve step climbing. The other novelty of the robot, in contrast to existing active suspension step climbers, is that it does not need the knowledge of step height beforehand.

Therefore, the mechanism has the advantage of height-independent climbing motion as in the case of passive mechanism along with the extra freedom of active joints for maintaining vehicle stability, only when required. Efficacy of the mechanism is exhibited through simulations on steps of various heights.

Magdeburg Zometa, Pablo OvG Univ. Magdeburg Findeisen, Rolf OVG Univ. Magdeburg  Many robotic applications, such as milling, glueing, or high precision measurements require the exact following of a pre-defined geometric path. We outline nonlinear model predictive control approaches to path-following problems. We show the real-time feasibility of predictive path following applied to an industrial robot. Specifically, we consider constrained output path following with and without pre- specified reference speeds. The proposed predictive path- following approach is experimentally validated considering a KUKA lightweight robot IV.

Magdeburg Findeisen, Rolf OVG Univ. Magdeburg  Nowadays many robotic tasks require close and compliant tracking of desired positions, paths, or forces. To achieve these goals, model- based control schemes provide a possible solution, allowing to directly consider the nonlinear dynamics. One of the key challenges, however, is the derivation of suitable models, which allow sufficiently fast evaluation, as well as the parameterization of these models based on measurements. In this work we outline and review a structured approach for model-based controller design for robots. In a first step we derive suitable models for multi-link robots. In a second step we review how such models can be parameterized and how optimal identification experiments can be designed. Based on the model we then derive a simple model based controller to experimentally validate the results considering a lightweight robot.

The single steps of the derivation and controller design are supported by a newly developed freely available model toolbox for the considered lightweight robot.

Dries, Johan Philips Healthcare de Jager, Bram Tech. Univ. Eindhoven Steinbuch, Maarten Eindhoven Univ. of Tech.

Obtaining high quality medical 3D reconstructions is of increasing importance for the medical community. The quality of a 3D reconstruction depends heavily on accurate knowledge of the position and orientation of the detector and X-ray source during a reconstruction scan. New developments in the considered class of medical imaging systems tend to lightweight design and an increasing number of scan positions. In this work, an alternative model-based approach is introduced for the currently used geometric system calibrations.

We consider a wind power plant of megawatt wind turbines operating in derated mode. When operating in this mode, the wind power plant controller is free to distribute power set-points to the individual turbines, as long as the total power demand is met. In this work, we design a controller that exploits this freedom to reduce the fatigue on the turbines in the wind power plant. We show that the controller can be designed in a decentralized manner, such that each wind turbine is equipped with a local low-complexity controller relying only on few measurements and little communication.

As a basis for the controller design, a linear wind turbine model is constructed and verified in an operational wind power plant of megawatt turbines. Due to limitations of the wind power plant available for tests, it is not possible to implement the developed controller; instead the final distributed controller is evaluated via simulations using an industrial wind turbine model. The simulations consistently show fatigue reductions in the magnitude of 15 ? 20 %.

Sonowal, Sukanya Seoul National Univ.

This paper presents a neural network-based adaptive compensation scheme to cancel the effect of uncertain, highly complex and dynamic synthetic jet actuator nonlinearities. Approximation of a nonlinearly parameterized model of synthetic jet actuator characteristics by a linearly parameterized function is performed using neural network approximators. The nonlinearity function is approximated over a range of rotor rotational speed of a wind turbine blade. An adaptive inverse is employed for cancelling the effect of actuator nonlinearities, which is accomplished by use if another neural network. Adaptive update laws are also employed for estimation of blade physical dimensional prameters. A state feedback control law is designed to control the nonlinear wind turbine dynamics in presence of signal dependent actuator nonlinearities.

Elshafei, Abdel Latif Faculty of Engineering  This paper discusses the rotor speed tracking loop configuration in maximum power point tracking (MPPT) in wind energy conversion system (WECS). A new loop configuration is proposed in which the aerodynamic torque is treated as an external disturbance. Internal model control and minimum variance control are used to achieve full disturbance rejection and exact reference tracking. Provided simulation results compare the performance of the proposed controller and the traditional (PI) controller with different wind profiles and reference speed trajectory patterns. A tradeoff between tracking performance and overall wind farm power quality is discussed and a solution is proposed.

Yame, Joseph Julien Univ. de Lorraine Sauter, Dominique D.J. Lorraine Univ.

In this paper, we present a real-time mechanism to accommodate faults occurring in a Wind Turbine (WT) system. The demonstrated mechanism lies under the taxonomy of Active Fault-tolerant Control (FTC) systems, namely the online redesign based approach. In the proposed approach, we do not use any a priori information about the model of the turbine in real-time. In fact, we use online measurements generated by the WT. Based on the given control specifications, and the observed measurement an occurred fault is accommodated by redesigning the controller online such that the WT generates rated power even under faulty conditions. Secondly, no explicit fault diagnosis (FD) module is used in this approach. As a result, issues of model uncertainty, false alarms, etc. associated with an integrated FD and controller reconfiguration approach to FTC systems are not experienced here.

Avanessov, Sergei Tallinn Univ. of Tech.

A novel mixed randomized/deterministic method to robust fixed-order controller design is proposed for discrete-time SISO plants. It is based on the random generation of Schur stable polynomials using reflection coefficients and reflection polytopes of polynomials. Stable reflection segments are projected onto affine set of closed-loop characteristic polynomials and the stabilizing polytopes in the controller parameter space are determined.

11:40-12:00 WeB01.2 Systems Modeling, Analysis and Control (SMAC) Toolbox: An Insight into the Robustness Analysis Library, pp. 176-181  Roos, Cl?ment ONERA  The analysis library of the new SMAC Toolbox for Matlab implements a set of mu-analysis based tools to evaluate the robustness properties of linear time-invariant systems affected by time-invariant uncertainties. These tools allow to compute both lower and upper bounds on the (skewed) robust stability margin, the worst-case Hinfinity performance level, as well as the worst-case gain, phase, modulus and time-delay margins. The key idea is to solve the    problem on just a coarse frequency grid and to perform a fast validation on the whole frequency range, which results in guaranteed but conservative bounds on the aforementioned quantities. Some heuristics are then applied to determine a set of worst-case parametric configurations leading to over-optimistic bounds. A branch and bound scheme is finally implemented, so as to tighten these bounds with the desired accuracy, while still guaranteeing a reasonable computational complexity.

Wang, Qing-Guo National Univ. of Singapore  Motivated by the complexity of solving convex scenario problems in one-shot, two new algorithms for the sequential solution of sampled convex optimization problems are presented, for full constraint satisfaction and partial constraint satisfaction, respectively. A rigorous analysis of the theoretical properties of the algorithms is provided, and the related sample complexity is derived. Extensive numerical simulations for a non-trivial example testify the goodness of the proposed solution.

Univ. of Denmark  We present an optimization based tuning procedure with certain robustness properties for an offset free Model Predictive Controller (MPC). The MPC is designed for univariate processes that can be represented by an ARX model. The advantage of ARX model representations is that standard system identification techniques using convex optimization can be used for identification of such models from input-output data. The stochastic model of the ARX model identified from input-output data is modified with an ARMA model designed as part of the MPC-design procedure to ensure offset-free control. The ARMAX model description resulting from the extension can be realized as a state space model in innovation form.

The MPC is designed and implemented based on this state space model in innovation form. Expressions for the closed-loop dynamics of the unconstrained system is used to derive the sensitivity function of this system. The closed-loop expressions are also used to numerically evaluate absolute integral performance measures. Due to the closed-loop expressions these evaluations can be done relative quickly. Consequently, the tuning may be performed by numerical minimization of the integrated absolute error subject to the a constraint on the maximum of the sensitivity function. The latter constraint provides a robustness measure that is essential for the procedure.

Kumar, Ratnesh Iowa State Univ.

This paper deals with the detection of (permanent) fault in the setting of stochastic discrete-event systems (DESs) under partial observability of events. Prior works have only studied the verification of the stochastic diagnosability (S-Diagnosability) property. To the best of our knowledge, this is a first paper that investigates the online detection schemes and also introduces the notions of their missed detections (MDs) and false alarms (FAs), and we establish that S- Diagnosability is a necessary and sufficient condition for achieving any desired levels of MD and FA rates. Next we provide a detection  scheme, that can achieve the specified MD and FA rates, based on comparing a suitable detection statistic, that we define, with a suitable detection threshold, that we algorithmically compute. We also algorithmically compute the corresponding detection delay bound.

The detection scheme also works for non-S-Diagnosable systems, with the difference that in this case only any FA rate can be met, and there exists a minimum MD rate that increases as FA rate is decreased.
