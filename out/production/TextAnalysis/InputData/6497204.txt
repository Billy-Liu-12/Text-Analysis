Abstract?Early detection of anomalies in any system or  component prevents impending failures and enhances  performance and availability. The complex architecture of  electronics, the interdependency of component functionalities,  and the miniaturization of most electronic systems make it  difficult to detect and analyze anomalous behaviors. A Hidden  Markov Model-based classification technique determines  unobservable hidden behaviors of complex and remotely  inaccessible electronic systems using observable signals. This  paper presents a data-driven approach for anomaly detection  in electronic systems based on a Bayesian Hidden Markov  Model classification technique. The posterior parameters of the  Hidden Markov Models are estimated using the conjugate  prior method. An application of the developed Bayesian  Hidden Markov Model-based anomaly detection approach is  presented for detecting anomalous behavior in Insulated Gate  Bipolar Transistors using experimental data. The detection  results illustrate that the developed anomaly detection  approach can help detect anomalous behaviors in electronic  systems, which can help prevent system downtime and  catastrophic failures.
