Rock Burst Forecasting in Deep Mine Based on New  Bionics Clustering Algorithm

Abstract-Rock burst is one big dynamic disaster in deep mine.

For the influence factors of rock burst are numerous and their relationship is very complicated, it's forecasting is a very hard  work, so generally based on engineering analogy and geology  analysis, the clustering methods are used in rock burst forecasting field. For the complicated environment influence of  rock burst, this clustering problem is a very complicated fuzzy  and random optimization problem, and can not be solved by traditional methods very well. So, here the new bionics clustering  algorithm-Ant Colony Clustering Algorithm which is proposed recently has been introduced into rock burst forecasting field for  the first time. Based on this new bionics clustering algorithm, one new method for study forecasting of rock burst is proposed.

Based on analyzing the data of rock burst samples, from the engineering analogy thinking by ant colony clustering algorithm,  the rock burst can be forecasted. At last, some real engineering examples are used to verify calculating effect of the new  algorithm. The engineering applications can prove that, this new  algorithm can automatically sort the rock burst samples, and the  validity is very high, the computing velocity is very rapidly, so it  is a very practical method for rock burst forecasting, and should  be popularized.

I. INTRODUCTION  When the deep resources are mined, the stress of the surrounding rock will be changed, so the elastic energy in the rock should be released rapidly. Then the big dynamic disaster which is called rock burst will be occurred. From analysis of the rock burst statistic data in the world, we can see that, the rock burst is one big disaster in deep mine and is one difficult problem in the world [1].

The final goal of rock burst study is to forecast it and to control it as soon as possible. For its extreme importance, there have been proposed a lot of traditional methods on rock burst forecasting [1-4]. But for the complicated nonlinear relationship between the rock burst and its influence factors, there are a lot of shortcomings in the traditional methods.

For the rock burst is a very complex opening giant system, it is influenced by many factors, in these influence factors, some are certain and quantitative, while the others are random, qualitative and fuzzy. So, to solve this problem, the engineering analogy and geology analysis is a more suitable method [4-7]. The key thinking of engineering analogy method is cluster. In the traditional clustering method, some   clustering parameters, such as category number, initial cluster center, et aI, should be determined by some engineering experience. And then the samples are trained according to the principles of distance minimum, until the square sum of distance between the samples and cluster centers is reached the minimum. Generally, the computing results of traditional method are depended on the clustering parameters. But the suitable clustering parameters can not be determined easily when the number of engineering samples is very large. And while, the argument and objective function are all discrete variables in rock burst forecasting problems, so there are many local minimax solutions. To solve this problem, the traditional method is not valid. In order to solve this problem very well, some profound studies are necessary.

Ant colony clustering algorithm is a new bionics optimization algorithm, and it has more advantages than many traditional methods. This new algorithm can solve many complicated optimization problems, which can not be solved very well by traditional methods. So, to solve the hard problem of rock burst forecasting, this new algorithm is introduced and while one new method to forecast the rock burst is proposed.



II. ANT COLONY CLUSTERING ALGORITHM  The idea of ant colony clustering algorithm is inspired by the behaviour of ant colonies in clustering their corpses and sorting their larvae. The first studies related to this domain is the work ofDeneubourg, et al [8], who have proposed a basic model that allowed ants to randomly move, pick up and drop objects according to the number of similar surrounding objects so as to cluster them. Based on the basic model, some other scholars, such as Lumer [9], Ramos [10] and Yang [11], et al have proposed many other modified algorithms, and obtained some useful achievements.

In order to describe the algorithm very well, the basic principle of the ant colony clustering algorithm is introduced here firstly.

Firstly, the data objects have been randomly projected onto one plane. Then each ant chooses an object at random, and picks up or moves or drops down the object according to picking-up or dropping probability with respect to the similarity of the current object within a local region. Finally, clusters are collected from the plane.

The process of the ant colony clustering algorithm is described by the pseudo-code as follows.

1) Initialization: initialize the number of ants: N, the entire number of iteration: M, side length of local region: s, and other parameters;  2) Project the data objects on a plane, i.e. give a pair of coordinates (x, y) to each object randomly;  3) Each ant that is currently unloaded chooses an object at random;  4) To each ant, one randomly selected moving speed is given;  5) Fori=1, 2, . . .  ,M Forj=l, 2, . . .  ,N  The average similarity of all objects is calculated.

If the ant is unloaded, compute picking-up  probability Pp- If Pp is greater than a random probability and one object is not picked up by the other ants simultaneously, then the ant picks up this object, marks itself as loaded, and moves this object to a new position; else the ant does not pick up this object and re-selects another object randomly.

If the ant is loaded, compute dropping probability Pd. If Pd is greater than a random probability, then the ant drops the object, marks itself as unloaded, and re-selects a new object randomly; else the ant continues moving the object to a new position.

End End 6) For i=l, 2, . . .  ,n II for all objects  If an object is isolated, that is the number of its neighbour is less than a given constant, then label it as an outlier;  Else give this object a cluster labelling number, and recursively label the same number to those objects who is the neighbours of this object within local region.

End The operations of the algorithm are described detailed as  follows.

1) The average similarity function: We assume that an ant is located at site r at time t, and finds an object 0i at that site.

The average similarity density of object 0i with the other objects OJ present in its neighbourhoodj{oi) is given by follow equation.

1 " d(o,o) J(o;)=max{O'2 L... [1- I } ]}  S "jENeigh",(,) a(1+(v-1)/vmax) . (1) where, a defines a parameter to adjust the similarity  between objects. The parameter v defines the speed of the ants, and Vmax is the maximum speed. Neighsxs(r) denotes a square  of s x s sites surrounding site r. d(o;,o) is the distance  between two objects 0i and OJ in the space of attributes. Here the Euclidean distance or Cosine distance is used. The Euclidean distance can be described as follows.

d(o;, 0) = i: (O;k -Ojk)2 . (2) k?1 where, m defines the number of attributes.

The Cosine distance can be described as follows.

where, simCo. 0. ) reflects the similarity metric between I' J two objects. It measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors ( their dot product divided by their magnitudes), which can be described as follows.

m L(Oik eojk) sim(oj,oj) = r=?k=?l===== i:(Oik)2 e i:(Ojk)2 k=l k=!

(4)  As the objects become more similar, the Cosine similarity  sim(o;,o) approaches 1 and their Cosine distance approaches  o.

From formula (1), we note that the parameter a affects the  number of clusters and the speed of algorithm convergence. If the a is bigger, the similarity between objects will be larger, and then the more objects will be clustered to one kind. So, the number of clusters will become less and the speed of algorithm will be faster. On the contrary, if the a is less, the similarity between objects will be less, and then the big type will be spited to some little types. So, the number of clusters will become larger and the speed of algorithm will be slower.

Otherwise, the speed v affects the cluster scale and the tendency of an ant to pick up or drop an object. Fast moving ants form clusters roughly on large scales, while slow ants group objects at smaller scales by placing objects with more accuracy. So, there are three definitions about speed v.

(a) v is a constant: all ants move with the same speed at any time.

(b) v is uniformly random: the speed of each ant is distributed randomly in [1, vmaxl  ( c) v is randomly decreasing: the speed term starts with large value (forming clusters), then the value of the speed gradually decreases in a random manner (helping ants to cluster more accurately).

Here, to study simply, the second definition is used.

2) The probability conversion function: The probability conversion function is one function ofj{oi), and its purpose is to convert the average similarity j{Oi) into the picking-up and dropping probabilities. The approach that the average similarity j{Oi) converts into the picking-up and dropping probabilities are based on: the smaller the similarity of a data object is ( i. e. there are not many objects that belong to the same cluster in its neighbourhood), the higher the picking-up probability is and the lower the dropping probability is; on the other hand, the larger the similarity is, the lower the picking? up probability is ( i. e. objects are unlikely to be removed from dense clusters) and the higher the dropping probability is.

According to this principle, the sigmoid function is used as probability conversion function here.

The picking-up probability for a randomly moving ant that is currently not carrying an object to pick up an object is given by follow equation.

Pp = 1- Sigmoid(f(oJ). (5)     As the same method, the dropping probability for a randomly moving loaded ant to deposit an object is given by follow equation.

Pd = Sigmoid(f(o;)). (6)  The sigmoid function has a natural exponential form as follow.

I -ex Sigmoid(x) = ? .

1+ e-ex (7)  where, c is a slope constant and can speed up the algorithm convergence as it is increased.

It must to be pointed out that, during clustering procedure, there might be some objects (also called outliers) with high dissimilarity to all other data element. The outliers block ants dropping down them and slow down the algorithm convergence. Here we choose larger parameter c to help ant to drop the outliers at the later stage of the algorithm.

Otherwise, the number of ants also affects the performance and convergence speed of algorithm. If the number of ants is too small, the speed of convergence will be slower. If the number of ants is too large, the performance of algorithm might be bad. The reason is that, when one object is picked up, and not decided where to drop it (i. e. this object is suspended), it can not be considered when the average similarity of its neighbourhood is computed. As the number of ants is too large, the number of objects that are suspended will be increased. And then, the accuracy of the algorithm will be reduced. So, in real application, the suitable number of ants should be selected by trial or engineering experience.



III. APPLICATION  Rock burst is one common dynamic disaster in coal mine.

So, the forecasting of rock burst is one main work in safety mining. For the influence factors of rock burst are various and their relationships are too complex, in computing, the selected influence factors must be representative, independent and easy gotten. According to importance, independence and easy measurement, and considering the real engineering experience, the main influence factors of rock burst in coal mine can be generalized into nine kinds, which can be showed as Table I.

To describe the rock burst rate easily, the numbers of 1, 2, 3, and 4 are used to remark the four rates, which are no rock burst, weak rock burst, moderate rock burst and strong rock burst.

Here, the parameters of ant colony clustering algorithm are selected as follows, N = 1O,M = 2000,s = 3,a = 2.5 VOlax = 0.85,c = 3 . According to those parameters, the computing results are as follow Table III. Also, the comparison of forecasting results of new algorithm and those of neural network is as follow Table IV.

So, ant colony clustering algorithm is a very good method for rock burst forecasting, and can be popularized in real engineering applications.

From the Table IV, we can see that, for the last five samples, the results of neural network are all right, and while for our new algorithm, one result is wrong. But for the neural network forecasting, the real situation of rock burst about all of the first twenty samples should be given in advance. And the number of the samples which real situation of rock burst is given must be enough. But in real practice, to get a lot of engineering examples which real situation of rock burst are known is a hard work. However, in our new algorithm, only some typical cases must be given, and its number may be little.

So, the hard work in neural network applications can be avoided.



IV. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK  For its computing complex, to forecast rock burst, the engineering analogy is a more suitable method. But for the influence factors of rock burst are numerous and their relationship is very complicated, in engineering analogy method, the clustering idea is used widely. Because the real environment influence of rock burst is very complicated, the  clustering problem is a very complicated fuzzy and random optimization problem, and can not be solved by traditional methods very well. To solve this problem very well, the new bionics clustering optimization method-Ant Colony Clustering Algorithm which is proposed recently is used for the first time.

Based on this new bionics clustering method, one new method for study forecasting of rock burst is proposed. At last, some real engineering examples are used to verify the calculating effect of the new algorithm. And the results show that, it is a very practical method for rock burst forecasting, and should be popularized.

For our work here is the preliminary application of ant colony clustering algorithm in geotechnical engineering field, there are lot of aspects, which must be researched profoundly, and then this is our next work.
