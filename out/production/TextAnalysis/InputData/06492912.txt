I. INTRODUCTION As international energy growing shortage and energy prices  continue to climb, energy management has become a research hotspot in recent years. Building enterprise energy management systems has been considered one of effective means to solve the problem of energy. In recent years, most studies focus on energy assessment and energy performance appraisal, etc. They focused on a single type of energy consumption for data mining through the traditional one-dimensional single-mining algorithms. However, few of them study the energy production process correlation analysis and data mining little research through the time dimension and space dimension.

During the literature has access [1] mines relevance of power consumption between equipments by improving the single-tree mining algorithm. Since the dispersion of energy management, digging relevance of early warning monitoring points during vast data has great significance, no matter in looking for the direction of energy early warning or exploring the causes of equipment failure.

With the complex industrial processes, industrial enterprises can no longer confined to a single energy, generally include water, electricity, steam, coal, oil etc comprehensive energy consumption. In addition, the characteristics of industrial enterprises energy consumption not only has relation with the production process, but also closely relates to production time, Industrial enterprises might reflect the characteristics of time, the situation of energy consumption may show obvious differences during different production period.

In order to tap associate rules of energy consumption early warning between widely distributed energy monitoring points.

This paper summarizes the time characteristics and spatial characteristics of the overall energy consumption of industrial enterprises, proposes a structured item-sets time and space mining algorithm. The algorithm introduces time dimension and space dimension, and has been improved on the basis of the classical Apriori algorithm, choose a large printing company as a pilot, made a good result.



II. DESCRIPTION AND ANALYSIS OF PROBLEM  A. Basic Concept In this paper, the structured item-sets time and space mining  algorithm.involves a number of conceptual level.

Define: 1 2{ , ... }nI i i i All data collection records constitute a transaction D ,  X Y are children sets of I  , satisfy the following equation: , , ,X I Y I X Y X Y  Then the association rule has the following basic concepts: Support: The probability of the two items in the transaction  set appear at the same time.

Confidence: The probability of the item set Y appears in the  premise of the item set X  appears in a transaction set D .

B. Description of the Problem  In the real industrial environment, important monitoring data often change with the changes of external factors such as time, environment, temperature etc, and shows different distribution. To tap the correlation between the various monitoring points, taking traditional mining algorithms will encounter a lot of bottlenecks.

For example, when the correlation in I has the time characteristics dig associate rules through Classic Apriori algorithm might produce the following two aspects:  1) Need to repeatedly scan the transaction set: When the transaction sets is very large, the algorithm efficiency will be greatly reduced.

2) Missing important association knowledge:Missing important association knowledge: Association rules that are time-sensitive association in a period may be ignored, due to the probability of appearing lower than the transaction set minimum support threshold.

On the other hand, with process of production automatic and industrial environment complex, an important monitoring point of industrial enterprises is often equipped with many types of monitoring instruments. Such monitoring also has its own complex internal structure, whereas the traditional mining algorithm generally applies only to a simple set of items.

C. Analysis of the Problem For items with time characteristics of various sub-problems,  this paper introduces time dimension, the time interval as a filter, set the transaction group. Grouping need to combine with the application of the actual background, when items are strongly time-sensitive, collection can be divided into multiple transactions in order to better tap the knowledge associated during some specific period and improve the efficiency of mining algorithms, otherwise, we should reduce the number of groups.

The consolidation of monitoring points within the smallest industrial enterprises is up to multiple aspects of own.

Minimum monitoring structure is shown below:  xi  xw xs  1xw 2xw 1xs 2xs  Figure 1. Structure of Minimum monitoring xi  For complex structures with minimum monitoring unit, the paper takes a structured set of concepts to represent them.

Structured item set shields the internal structure makes the complex items as a whole object.

After introducing spatial dimensions, this paper takes using top-down and filter layer of the excavation strategy to multi-tap.

This way, to a certain extent, the association will miss low-level knowledge, however, that can greatly save saving algorithm space and avoid digging a huge candidate sets in the lower.



III. THE BASIC IDEA AND DESCRIPTION OF ALGORITHM  A.  Data Packet Based on the above analysis, the item sets in I have the time  characteristics, this paper introduce time dimension to set the transaction data packet. Set transaction data set D  records for a year, year time span isT .

Grouping Rules: Define 1 2 nT T T T , take iT as the filter criteria. Then:  1 2{ , , }nD D D D 1 2 1 2,n nD D D D D D D  iD is data set during the period of iT .

Set transaction set minimum support threshold: MinS ,  Minimum confidence threshold: MinC , each data set the minimum support threshold and minimum confidence threshold can be based on the following formula:  ( ) ( ) ( )  i iMinS D MinS  S D S D  (1)  ( ) ( ) ( )  i iMinC D MinC  S D S D  (2)  B. Representation of Structured Item Sets The monitoring results of monitoring in industrial  enterprises are up to multiple aspects of internal. It reflects a comprehensive result through comparing data with various types of monitoring indicators. On the one hand to simplify the mining objects, making the different structured item sets of equality, the other in order to preserve the minimum level of monitoring points within the existing structure, excavation to prepare the necessary follow-up analysis, This paper presents a structured item set represent the smallest unit, which shielded the monitoring unit within the sub-item structure, making different monitoring points in the same category equality.

Minimal monitoring structure is shown in Figure 1, the x monitoring points can be represented by xi  The relationship between xi and his children of next level can be expressed as:  { ,..., }x x xi w s In order to tap the association between monitoring points,  researchers just need to use the classic mining algorithm Apriori algorithm to dig structured item sets. The introduction of structured item sets doesn?t cut off the internal relationship between monitoring points and their children, and tap association of their children also have important meanings.

C. Multi-tap The DCS architecture in industrial field makes monitoring  of different types show a multi-distribution, therefore, this paper introduce spatial dimensions to divide the level of object. This paper take top-down approach to dig association rules between structured item sets, and adopt layer filter search strategy to     avoid too many candidate item sets, the frequent item sets of the I layer as follows:  1 2 3{ , , , }x x x xi i i i Suppose:  1 2 3{ , , , }y y y yi i i i , 1 2 3{ , , , }z z z zi i i i Then the items of the i+1 layer as follows:  1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3{ , , , , , , , , , }x x x y y y z z zJ i i i i i i i i i Minimum support threshold of 1i  layer  and minimum  confidence threshold of 1i  layer  depends on iMinS , iMinC , the length of frequent item sets and the length of item  sets, Set minimum support threshold of 1i  layer : 1iMinS minimum confidence threshold of 1i  layer: 1iMinC can according to the following formula:  ( ) ( )  k i iMinS MinS  L L L J  (3)  ( ) ( )  k i iMinC MinC  L L L J  (4)

IV. IMPLEMENTATION AND APPLICATION OF ALGORITHM  A. Background of Application Improved algorithm has been applied to a large printing  enterprise, and its? major energy contain electricity, water, steam and etc. Workshop in enterprise includes nine work areas.

Each work area is equipped with a total energy consumption monitoring. The total energy consumption monitoring is equipped with total electricity meters, total water meters and the total steam instrument, which is used to monitor the overall energy consumption of work area. Each following work area also establishes a number of monitoring points, which is used to monitor an important process or important energy-consuming equipment. Sub monitoring is equipped with electricity, water and steam meter.

The total monitoring points and sub monitoring points have similar physical structure, therefore this paper introduces minimum energy consumption monitoring model to represent a physical model of the monitoring points.

Minimum structural model of energy consumption monitoring is shown below:  E  P W S Figure 2. Minimum structural model of energy consumption monitoring  E stands for Comprehensive energy consumption of monitoring, P stands for electricity consumption, W stands for water consumption, S  stands for steam consumption.

Multi-tier logical structure that is based on minimum energy monitoring can be as shown below:  Figure 3.  Multi-layer structure of energy consumption monitoring  In addition, the printing enterprise has collected a large amount of monitoring data in a year. These monitoring data are no different in theory. However, these monitoring data have an important correlation with the printing production. For example, printing products are thin in summer, while are fairly robust in winter. The interval the product soaking in the dye vat will be significantly different in different seasons. This difference will impact consumption of the different seasons. Therefore, the association of various monitoring points is different during different production periods.

B. Detail Operations The production process in pilot enterprises collects energy  consumption data once every 30 minutes. The detail of the algorithms this paper presents as follows: 1) Data Packet: Divide energy database into four data  areas 1D 2D 3D 4D  .

Analysis  1) The impact of the introduction of time dimension against frequent item sets.

Follow 4.2 operation output frequent item sets of each area as follows:  TABLE V. FREQUENT ITEM SETS OF EACH AREA  Data area frequent item sets of first layer  frequent item sets of second layer  1D 2 3 8, ,E E E 22 32 34 82, , ,E E E E 2D 2 4,E E 22 41 42, ,E E E 3D 2 3 6, ,E E E 22 32 34 61, , ,E E E E  4D 2 8,E E 22 82,E E Table 1 and table 7 shows the output of the frequent item  sets are also different during each different period. The introduction of time dimension helps dig out all the specific association rules during each period. These association rules can help industrial enterprise management more accurately master energy consumption warning law.

2) The impact of the introduction of time dimension and space dimension against mining efficiency.

The introduction of time dimension and spatial dimension divide transactions sets into each data area of each level.

Increase the number of partitions experimental results under different split times by different mining algorithms are shown below:  Figure 5. The impact on execution that increase split times by different mining Algorithm  Traditional mining: without introducing spatial dimensions, treat the total monitoring points and monitoring points as equal item-sets, adopt the traditional algorithm dig association.

Divide sample data into each layer, independent mining at each layer: Introduce spatial dimensions, and divide different types of monitoring points into different levels, independent mining at each layer.

Divide layers, adopt layer filter mining strategy: Introduce spatial dimensions, divide different types of monitoring points into different levels, and adopt layer filter mining strategies for mining.

Figure 5 shows that the introduction of space-time dimensions, adopting the filter layer strategy demonstrates best mining efficiency. In addition, increase split time, the size of transactions in each data area is declining, meanwhile the amount of each transaction data set is also correspondingly increasing, therefore, the algorithm efficiency does not necessarily increase with the increase of filter times. According to the actual situation, in order to maximize improve mining efficiency the best way is to find the best split times.



V. The End This paper proposes a structured item-sets time and space  algorithm, which was improved on the basis of classical Apriori algorithm, introducing time dimension and space dimension help dig out all the specific association rules during each period and each data area. These association rules can help industrial enterprise management master energy consumption warning law better. Compare with traditional single-mining algorithms, new algorithm is more efficiency. In addition, the new algorithm adopting layer by layer filtering strategy avoids producing large candidate sets in the lower excavation. This new time-space mining algorithms can be applied to other similar industrial fields.
