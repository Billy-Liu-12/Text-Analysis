Abstract - This paper analyses several recent treatises on hybridised self- organising map (SON theory. Each article proposes a solution to expedite the SOM mapping process and provide more accurate results within a shorter response time via hybridisation: including utilisation of Bayesian classification techniques; an interactive associative search and exploration tool; and, the use of a hierarchical organization of tiered SOM?s with input derived via auto-assoeiative feedfnrwsrd neural network technology. In this paper, we propose that an amalgamation of SOM and assoeiation rule theory may hold the key to a more generic solution, less reliant on initial supervision and redundant user interaction. The results of clustering stem words from text documents could be utilised to derive association rules which designate the applicability of documents to the user. A four stage process is consequently detailed, demonstrating a generic example of how a graphical derivation of associations may be derived from a repositow of text documents, or even a set of synopses of many such repositories.



I. INTRODUCHON The information age has witnessed a flood of massive digital  libraries and knowledge bases which have evolved dynamically and continue to do so. Hence, there is a well documented necessity for intelligent, concise mechanisms that can organise, search and classify such overwhelming well-springs of information. The more fundamental, traditional methods for collating and searching collections of text documents lack the ability to manage such copious resources of data. Data mining is the systematic derivation of trends and relationships in such large quantities of data [I]. There is have much recent research in data mining sizeable text data stores for knowledge discovery. The self-organising map (SOM) is a data mining innovation which is purported to have made significant steps in enhancing knowledge discovery in very large textual data stores [2]. The latter describes a SOM as a normally unsupervised neural-network  A New Approach To Hybrid SOM Implementations For Text Classification Paul Gunther and Phoebe Chen  Cooperative Information Systems Research Centre Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane QLD 4001, Australia  E-mail: paulm@,ua .net.au, p .chen@aut.edu.au  process that produces a graph of similarity of the data. A finite set of models are derived which approximate the open set of input data. Each model is a neural node in the map and a recursive process clusters similar models on this map (thus the term self-organising).The fundamental benefit of the SOM is that it derives a lower dimensionality mapping in situations of high dimensionality. The clusters are arranged in this low dimensional topology to preserve the neighbourhood relations in the high dimensional data [3]. This relationship consequently holds true for clusters themselves as well as nodes within a single cluster. Whilst self-organising maps have proven a demonstrated usefulness in text classification, the primary deficiency is the time required to initially train them [3, 71. Even though the preliminary training can be unsupervised, the time required to perform the operation limits the applicability of SOM as a potential solution in real-time searches. The scope of this document is to analyse several approaches at hybridising the SOM methodology in an attempt to circumvent the above- mentioned deficiency. These techniques come &om separate research carried out by external researchers and documented in  appropriate journals. The papers chosen all propose a form of hybridisation of self-organising maps which extends the fundamental SOM concept to include concepts external to the base SOM theory. This tenet is closely related to the author?s own preliminary work and thus of interest. In previous work researched, all discuss the importance of pre-processing the text documents for simplification [5-91. An implicit assumption is made that all text documents are in the same language. Whilst the author will maintain this inherent assumption, it may hold bearing on such pre-processing, especially with respect to document sources with documents in different languages, or indeed, multi-lingual records.

The common denominator in textual pre-processing follows the two steps of: removing stop-words and stemming keywords.

Stop-words are words which hold little to no intrinsic meaning within themselves and merely serve to connect language in semantic and syntactic structure. Secondly, stemming is the process of derive the root word fiom words via removal of superfluous prefixes and suffixes which would only serve to produce redundant items in a derived index of terms. The underlying process of mapping text documents relies upon indexation of keywords and utilisation of such pre-processing serves to maximise both precision and recall in this process. In this paper, there are the following sections: a synopsis of previous, generally related work; a more focussed examination of several SOM hybrid approaches, including comparison against our defined set of criteria; the preliminary description of our approach to self-organising map hybridisation, once again, contrasted on the same set of criteria; and, a conclusion covering further research yet to be performed.

11. RELATED WORK Whilst there has been abundant literature on SOM theory, as  mentioned previously, we have focussed on the following as preliminary reading. SOM?s are often related to document collation [13]. It is in this document that it seems that SOM is first widely purported to be an exceptionally viable method in classifying large collections of text documents and organizations of such into maps. Although this document was more preliminary and focussed on a more interactive map for visualisation, other research provided a corollary with more formal evidence of SOM usage on very large document stores [2]. The example provided scaled up the SOM algorithm to derive a map with more than a million node kom input categorised into 500 dimensions. Over 6.8 million documents were subsequently mapped. Parallelism and several optimising short-cuts were utilised to expedite the initial training. Such steps may not be feasible in a more generic solution where the documents may be more loosely formatted and not as uniform in layout and/or contents. Other work, published at a similar time,  0-7803-7293-W011$17.00 Q 2001 lEEE 968 2001 IEEE International Fuzzy Systems Conference    proposed utilisation of clustering of the SOM output rather via the SOM itself and directly relates to the papers analysed more comprehensively, below [I 1, 121. Such a hierarchical approach allows for a faster initial solution and then consequent, more detailed mappings to drill down and fme tune the data mining.

This derivation of associations which are fed into the supplementary SOM is the key interest of the authors.

Furthermore, two of the documents analysed more thoroughly in this paper implement a more sophisticated variant of this methodology [4, 131. Another proposes a similar concept with an approach designated as multiple self-organising maps [14].

The base tenet of the mechanics of applying distance measures to string inputs for a SOM is examined [ 151. Although more related to symbol parsing, rather than true text document mapping, it warrants a higher level examination for the overall ?philosophy?.

Conversely, other previous work specifically focussed on knowledge acquisition from internet date repositories [ 161.



III. COMPARISON O F  HYBRIDISED  Three recent techniques have warranted a more detailed analysis and comparison: utilisation of SOM approximation of probability densities of each class to ?exploit? Bayesian theory to minimise the average rate of misclassifications [13]; amalgamation of an interactive associative search instigated by the user with SOM theory [3]; and, development of a hierarchical pyramid of SOM?s in which a higher level tier allows subsequent drilling down into and derivation of a more fine-tuned map [4].

All of these methods share a commonality with respect of utilisation of a hybridised SOM in text-based data mining and information retrieval. In our analysis we will cover sub-topics: use of hierarchy, level of hybridisation, degree of generality, and requirement for supervision andor interaction. Finally a brief synopsis of the deficiencies of each methodology is provided.

A. APPLICABILITY WITH RESPECT TO CRITERIA  Use of Hierarchy: Previous research stressed that document collections inherently lend themselves to a hierarchical structure [4].

This hierarchy should be directly originate from the subject matter.

Their research resulted in a mechanism for producing a hierarchical feature map - each element in a SOM expands into a SOM of its own until sufficient detail has been explored. This approach allows for user interaction in such that the desired level of detail can by chosen; thereby preventing unnecessary mining sophistication and delay but still maintain the desirable degree of precision. Similar in technique, the proposal to integrate Bayesian classification maintains the fundamental principal of training an independent SOM for each class derived  om the training set. The difference is that once the basis for the collection of SOM?s is formed, they are merely kept in an array-like structure and there is no utilisation of a hierarchy other than the two tiers of the classes and the reliant self-organising maps. Indeed, although the interactive associative search method is relatively simplistic in its explanation of SOM usage, it demonstrates a more advanced use of hierarchical principle. A preliminary search via contemporary mechanisms would produce a result set. The proposed extension would subsequently obtain similar documents derived as near neighbours on a SOM. This entails a relatively simple hierarchy between a contemporary solution and SOM technology.

Level of Hybridisation: Both the formal hierarchical SOM pyramid and integration with Bayesian theoty method implement a potential solution via multiple SOMs. Cervera?s implementation utilises neuron proximity in the self-organising map as approximations of the class probability densities. Bayesian classification theory is subsequently  SELF-ORGANUING MAP  applied to minimise error in the classification process and to optimise the resultant clusters. The methodology instigated by Merkl ordinarily entails a very highdimensional feature set correlated to the number of index terms required. This feature set dictates the vector representation of a text document for mapping. It is stated that to overcome this ?vocabulary problem?, auto-associative feedforward neural network technology is subsequently used to optimise compression of this feature space. This reduces patterns of hquently cosccuning words to a single word [21]. In contmst, other work relied upon an interactive associative search instigated by the user [3]. The underlying dimensionality rduction is dependent on word category map construction, just like FVEBSOM [13]. Conversely, some research implemented fundamental information retrieval mechanisms for .

stemming superfluous word segments and filtering ?noise? stop-words [3, 41. Indeed, the former document purports that even current, Contemporary search engines should readily adopt this principle. These two papers also share a commonality with respect to exploiting the ready visualisation abilities of SOM technology (cE [5, 161). In either implementation scenario, the resultant hierarchy of results is presented to the user via the graphical nature of SOM output.

Degree of Generality: While Cervera, et al, actually documented experiments on sonar signals and audio recognition of vowel sounds h m  several speakers, the principles maintained in the relevant research would notably hold true for all aspects of SOM unsupervised learning [13]. Likewise, although the hierarchical SOM pyramid methodology was originally designed specifically for text document classification, the base tenets of constructing a pyramid of hierarchically tiered self- organising maps would be equally applicable in other -SOM scenarios.

The interactive associative search hybrid, however, is heavily reliant on user interaction and the design principle weighs heavily on this interactivity and visual exploration. Whilst the SOM?s ?natural? applicability to visualisation does hold true for other applications, the hybridisation aspects of this research is dependent on document map queries. There are probably only minor facets which could be utilised if symbol strings, such as via [ 151, were derived. Furthermore, the actual SOM manufacture is a static process in this implementation where clustering is pre-processed for a finite and discrete suite of documents beforehand. Thus, there is a possibility that the overall architecture is not generic for all cases of text documents. This is the opposite of the design of the other two proposals where the inhtructure would conceptually handle all generic text document clustering situations.

Requirement for SupervisiodInteraction: Each method holds a differing degree of supervisory dependence. Although the unsupervised associative search is indeed instigated by a user, it has the least in that SOM production is completely unsupervised and an initial pre- processing stage is performed before the results are viewed. The user intervention is corollary to this, at a later time, and it is only then when the user perfonns interactive associative searching that results are tailored.The hierarchical pyramid of SOM?s is dependent on user interaction to decide which higher level tier requires drilling down into and consequent derivation of a more fine-tuned map. However, conceptually, the entire process could be also all pre-processed for n tier levels. Such a scenario would be infeasible due to constraints on user expectation for timely results (or suffer the same deficiency as the unsupervised associative search with respect to only being applicable to a static set of documents from a source). The hybridisation with Bayesian theory was inherently designed with a supervised component.

Production of probability density approximations via Bayesian classification is reliant on supervised training. As such, although the interaction with users after mapping is not relevant, the pre-requisite for an expert to initially train the system is.

Overall Deficiencies: The fundamental inadequacy in the Bayesian classification hybrid is the reliance on a supervised component for expediting the classification. In the proposed scenario for dynamic implementation on text-based documents provided on an a priori basis,     there is little scope for initial pre-training with a specialised training set provided by an expert. Another approach must be fashioned to provide more accurate SOM mappings.The base methodology of an interactive associative search is relatively simplistic and reliant on pre-processing the entire suite of documents to be examined before initiating an interactive associative search with the end user. Once again, this would be inadequate in the scenario in question of a priori-based documents from unknown data sources and repositories (such as an internet search, e.g.

A pyramid of hierachical SOM?s is perceived to be the closest to the target of such ad hoc, dynamic interactive searches with the hierarchical organization of SOM?s. The example provided in the experiment, nonetheless, is not rich enough to provide comprehensive feedback on timeliness in a ?real-world? scenario. The resultant feature space on a much higher dimensionality caused by a large set of index terms would be time prohibitive.

IV. A NEW APPROACH IN SOM HYBRIDISATION There many aspects of self-organising map theory which are  adaptable to hybridisation and cross-pollination of new ideas. In terms of classification of text-based documents such hybridisation must expedite the mapping process yet remain unsupervised. It is also most likely that the user will wish to alter the output resolution. The inherent barrier to efficient knowledge acquisition in such circumstances is the underlying feature space.

This resultant very high dimensionality is directly originates from the requirement of a high set of index terms. Even with advanced information retrieval stemming and stop-word filtering, this will cause both loss of precision accuracy and effect recall.

Without dimensionality reduction on this feature space, results will furthermore not be available in a timely manner. A hierarchically-based solution is desirable but a simple approach of merely forming a pyramid of SOM?s would not facilitate optimisation of the feature space. Pre-processing the document repository/s is, of course, not a viable option. Further research is required to form another hybrid proposal, most likely cross- pollinating M e r  ideas from other data mining theory.

A. HYBRIDISATION OF SOM TEEORY - ASSOCIATION RULES A generic framework may be proposed in which the concepts of episodes and episode rules are developed [2]. These are derived from the base concept of association rules and frequent sets, when applied to sequential data. Text, as sequential data, can be perceived as a sequence of (feature vector, index) pairs where the former is an ordered set of features and the latter information about the position of the word in the sequence. Consequently, episode rule may be derived with respect to these episode pairs, as per association rule theory. In our approach, simpIiflmg the paradigm further, the clusters derived from a SOM could be equated to frequent itemsets. As such, these may, in turn, be fed to an association rule based engine which would consequently develop association rules. In order to simplify the initial classification process, redundant stop-words would be removed and only the word stems of the text documents considered. This helps alleviate the verbosity of natural language and allows rule derivation to take place on the simplest, core level. The previous work on episodes and their derived rules was too intrinsically bound to grammatical context and punctuation; we wish to  develop a more holistic perspective about the overall document context. This will, in turn, derive more fundamental associations, rather than similar rules bound by the original grammatical context. Fig. 1 demonstrates a itamework overview on how the hybridisation will supplement knowledge discovery in text mining. The representation of initial text documents could equally be applicable to either a text datastore or a repository of meta-data on text datastores themselves. It is the relation of SOM classification results to association rule derivation which is the fundamental focus, not the underlying source of SOM input. The inherent scope for research relates to the application of two data mining methodologies into a hybridised amalgamation. The resultant variant is intended to expedite the text mining process on large document collections (cf. [4,, 161).

Fig 1 .Process Steps in the Amalgamation of SOM and Association Rule Theory  B.EWPLE OF PROCESSING To better illustrate the processing which occurs in each step, a brief generic example will be provided.

Preprocessing: The initial set of documents may equally represent either a single text document repository or a result set detailing the meta-data derived from a collection of such repositories. In the former instance, the input to the preprocessing stage (I) is a set of ?records? where each record is a document comprised of previously unparsed text.

In the latter scenario, each record is a synopsis of a text document datastore with meta-data, such as repository key terms and/or abstracts, etc. The actual preprocessing phase reduces the textual component into a set of common stem words (2). This process relies upon relatively standardised information retrieval processes for detection and removal of redundant stop words, as well as the discovery of pertinent stem words (e.g. [3,4]).

Classification: The second stage accepts the stem word sets (2) and utilises them as input to a standard self-organising map of relatively small size. It is envisaged that the common two-dimensional SOM will be implemented as there is deemed to be no rationale or circumstances which warrant a more complex model to map to. The range of each dimension will be low to expedite clustering as it is by far more likely that the order of magnitude of input sets would be in the order of hundreds rather than thousands. In a similar vein to the initial phase, the underlying mechanics of processing the inputs relies upon existing SOM technology, which is well documented in a multitude of sources. The only specialisation made is the extraction of the resultant SOM output array en masse as an input to the next stage (3). The operation of the initial preprocessing and classification steps may occur in parallel as the outputs of the former are merely ?fed? to the latter asynchronously.

Discovery: In this processing step, there is a realistic expectation that the contents of each cluster in the input, (3), may be equated to frequent itemsets. Taking a Euclidean perspective as the basis of supposition, for the sake of simplicity, the distance measures taken form neighbourhood fimctions are perceived to provide a firm foundation for derivation of association rules. In figure 2, below, we can see that     Distance,, is much smaller than Distance,,. Hence, there is a quantifiably higher degree of associativity between Cluster, and Ckuster, than it and Cluster,. e Distance Cluster ________----__-__----- -=.- Distance  Fig. 2. Distances Between Clusters Whilst more formal association rule techniques, such as Apriori [26-191, will most likely need to be implemented to derive confidence and support levels, it is envisaged that the process may be expedited by examining the distance measures for initial itemset suitability. The derived association rules may be represented as two-dimensional vectors designating the key stem words which imply other, related stems (4).

Postprocessing: The associations derived in the discovery phase (4) may be represented to the user as a mathematical graph. This provides feedback on which ?records? relate to which others and via what key words. Of course, links may be incremental in such that Node, is indirectly related to Noded via Node, (see figure 3). w - m  Node,  Fig. 3. Associations Represented as Graph Nodes In the latter context of associations for entire text document datastores, it is perceived to be feasible to subsequently ?drill down? into a desired repository and perform the same associative process on it, discovering more detailed rule derivations via classification of its more thorough set of stem keywords.

cw hPWCABILITY WITE RESPECT TO CRITERIA  In order to contrast our approach, it is ideal to analyse it with respect to the criteria we detailed above.

*Use of Hierarchy: Overall, hierarchy is merely a two tiered approach where the SOM clustering is a foundation for association rule data mining. However, there is an intrinsic hierarchy to the rules themselves in that the derived associations can lead to subsequent ones. For example, an association that there is a high degree of support that documents with reference to nests also reference buds can point to a corollary association in which it was discovered that documents referring to buds also referred to trees.

Level of Hybridisation: The amalgamation of association rule data mining theory with that of SOM classification entails a relatively high level of hybridisation.

Degree of Generaliry: Although specifically designed for text mining applications, the initial source of stemmed source t e r n  may be kom a repository of text documents or a datastore of meta-terms relating to multiple text document sources. Indeed, there is no perceivable limitation on the holistic approach to even non-text based originating sources, as long as the rule derivation maintains a base level of ?common sense? to the original data.

Requirement for Supervisiodhteraction: There is no perceived requirement for supervision in this model; also, there is deemed to be little necessity of pre-requisite user interaction, except in terms of defining the initial document source. At the completion of the postprocessing stage, it is feasible that user interaction may occur with the model?s results. If the initial original data source was a pool of meta-data on lower level document stores, the user may wish to repeat the process on a lower level of abstraction on the actual text document repositories deemed applicable. The inherent methodology utilised in the SOM hybrid is unsupervised, whilst associative user interaction may be  introduced to exploit the Underlying architectwe, the base model is foreseen to be independent of supervision requirements.



V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK Existing hybrids of SOM theory are not perceived to  effectively address the requirements in data mining text documents: a high degree of generality for generic text mining without the requisite initial supervised training. An optimum solution would efficiently flag applicable documents Without a necessity for a phase of preparation via training or high level of user interaction. Furthermore, it is exceptionally desirable that multiple levels of abstraction be catered for; in which more generic original sources with less granularity may be drilled down into to obtain more focussed dependent repositories. The proposed amalgamation of SOM and association rule theories is identified as a feasible model for such text mining applications.

It is envisaged that the viability of this technique may be proven with respect to efficiency and precision of results. Further scope also exists in implementing corollary SOM and association rule theory to expedite the output delivery, but the underlying, fundamental methodology is viewed to be a sound platform for relatively expeditious and efficient text mining.
