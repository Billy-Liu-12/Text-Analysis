Abstract?The next generation wireless networks are expected to  operate in fully automated fashion to meet the burgeoning  capacity demand and to serve users with superior quality of  experience. Mobile wireless networks can leverage spatio-  temporal information about user and network condition to  embed the system with end-to-end visibility and intelligence. Big  data analytics has emerged as a promising approach to unearth  meaningful insights and to build artificially intelligent models  with assistance of machine learning tools. Utilizing  aforementioned tools and techniques, this paper contributes in  two ways. First, we utilize mobile network data (big data) ? call  detail record (CDR) ? to analyze anomalous behavior of mobile  wireless network. For anomaly detection purposes, we use  unsupervised clustering techniques namely k-means clustering  and hierarchical clustering. We compare the detected anomalies  with ground truth information to verify their correctness.  From  the comparative analysis, we observe that when the network  experiences abruptly high (unusual) traffic demand at any  location and time, it identifies that as anomaly. This helps in  identifying regions of interest (RoI) in the network for special  action such as resource allocation, fault avoidance solution etc.

Second, we train a neural-network based prediction model with  anomalous and anomaly-free data to highlight the effect of  anomalies in data while training/building intelligent models. In  this phase, we transform our anomalous data to anomaly-free  and we observe that the error in prediction while training the  model with anomaly-free data has largely decreased as compared  to the case when the model was trained with anomalous data.

I. INTRODUCTION  ASSIVE amount of data and information are produced by  and about people, things and their interactions. In  wireless communication industries, the major drivers of big  data are the increasing number of smart devices, machine-to-  machine (M2M) communications, and penetration of social  media. With communication network evolution towards 5G, a  multitude of technologies like base station (BS) densification  and massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) are     Manuscript received October 31, 2016.

expected to elevate the size of data exponentially. The data are  generated at very large scale (volume) with expected size of  24.3 Exabyte (EB) per month [1], with fast input/output  to/from the network (velocity) and from various sources  within and outside the network (variety) and the quality and  trust of the data available at an incomparable level of volume,  velocity and variety (veracity). These unconventional 4V  features (volume, velocity, variety, veracity) of current data  generation give birth to big data and thus its management and  analysis require schemes for big data analytics [2].

Big data analytics is an umbrella term, that incorporates  methods and technologies, hardware and software for  collecting, managing and analyzing large scale structured and  unstructured data in real-time.  Big data analytics works on  entire data as opposed to only sample data in conventional  data analytics schemes. In the case of small data, analyses  were performed by randomly selecting samples (partial data)  that were considered as representative of the whole data. Due  to analysis of only partial data, the information extracted are  inaccurate and incomplete and thus the decisions made are  sub-optimal and the performance achieved are poor and sub-  optimal. Especially in the case of real network analysis and  troubleshooting, precise and quick information are desired for  providing exact solution, which can only be possible if  whole/big data is analyzed. For current and the envisioned 5G  mobile networks, big data offers a number of solutions in a  variety of ways; some of them are outlined below [2].

a. Big data analytics offer end-to-end visibility of the wireless network  b. Big data analytics enables self-coordination among network functions and entities  c. Big data analytics enables assessment of long-term dynamics of the network  d. Big data analytics builds faster and proactive network e. Big data analytics enables smart and proactive caching  in wireless network  f. Big data analytics enables energy efficient network operation  g. Big data analytics would enable unified performance evaluation  In mobile wireless network, there are a number of network  measurements and parameters which are continuously  exchanged among, reported and gathered at/from the User  Equipment (UE), and nodes in the Radio Access Network  (RAN) and Core network of the long term evolution -  advanced (LTE-A) network.

Citation information: DOI 10.1109/TII.2017.2650206, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics   record (CDR), reference signal received power (RSRP), radio  link failure (RLF) report, location information, UE movement  behavior etc. Additionally, with the emergence of 5G, there  will be huge increase in number of devices and nodes in the  network; the dynamicity and heterogeneity of user and  network environment etc., causing exponential increase in the  number and types of data. By analyzing the network  measurements and information, network performance can be  improved in three major ways. First, it enables effective  control and optimization of network. Second, it facilitates  service providers to optimize and enhance customer?s  experience by gauging all the relevant historical data. Last but  not the least, network analytics-enabled insights can facilitate  efficient network planning and deployment. Thus, network  performance can be continuously monitored, instantly  optimized and proactively protected from possible faults,  enabling an intelligent and self-organized network (SON).

In this paper, we exploit call detailed record (CDR)  information collected from core network (CN) of a real mobile  cellular network. The spatio-temporal information contained  within the CDR helps us analyze user specific activity in a  certain region at a particular time and date. By anomaly in this  paper, we mean abnormal or unusual behavior or activity  pattern of user and thus an accordingly effect on the network.

Anomaly in network performance can be noticed due to  multiple reasons such as sleeping cell, hardware failures, surge  in traffic etc. Successful anomaly detection and its proper  treatment results in multiple benefits, e.g., at a place like  stadium, when the provided bandwidth resource does not  suffice the highly-dense user demands then it will cause choke  in bandwidth, and it will appear as anomaly in the network.

On one hand, such behaviors are considered normal in telecom  and are not usually counted amongst anomalies. On the other  hand, categorizing them into anomalies would help the  network operators not only in detecting them but also in  determining the region of interests (ROI), for which proper  network resources can be proactively allocated for enhanced  quality of experience.

Our contributions towards anomaly detection in this paper are  as follows.

1. We utilize machine-learning tools namely K-means clustering and Hierarchical clustering to detect anomalies.

2.  We verify and compare the anomalies with those found through ground truth observation to determine their accuracy.

3. After anomaly detection and verification, the performance of anomaly-free data is evaluated by passing it through a neural network based prediction model that forecasts future traffic pattern. We observe that the mean square error between the training, validation and test data is largely reduced as compared to that in the case when the model was trained with anomalous data.

Although the above machine learning tools have widely  been used in literature, we utilize them here with the purpose  of comparing the anomaly detection performances among  themselves before comparing with anomalies found through  ground truth data. This paper demonstrates a key use case and  underlying processes of analyzing user and network behavior  utilizing data collected from mobile network. Additionally, it  discusses and presents forecasting network activity with  anomaly-free data, which is an important step behind making  the network intelligent and accurate. The network analytics  presented is one of the viable approaches for enabling smart  societies where almost everything will be connected and each  task will be performed intelligently such as health services,  diet instruction etc. Based on similar concept, an idea of  Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) has been presented in [3] to  understand needs of elderly people, by analyzing data  collected from various types of nodes in the surrounding  network.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II  describes the relevant work in the literature. The dataset and  the preprocessing using has been explained in Section III. In  Section IV, we discuss the machine learning algorithms  utilized for detecting anomalies. Section V investigates the  anomalies found through the learning algorithms. The  prediction model and its performance comparison in case of  data with anomaly and without anomaly have been discussed  in section VI. Section VII concludes the paper.



II. RELEVANT WORK  In the literature, anomaly detection has been performed  through various supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised  learning methods. Authors in [4] proposed a framework that  categorizes large size CDR into different call profile and  accordingly classify network usages. As a by-product, the  proposed framework identifies unexpected traffic that is  anomalous as compared to the normal. They consider large-  scale dataset of voice calls, however, our dataset is comprised  of voice calls as well as text messages. Article [5] categorized  anomaly detection techniques for Big Data based on nearest  neighbors, clustering and statistical approaches. Their finding  suggests that for real datasets, clustering based anomaly  detection technique performs the best and second best  performance was attained by the nearest neighbor based  technique k-NN. In [6 - 8], k-means clustering approach has  been performed on CDR for different purposes such as  identifying Industrial Parks & Office Areas, Commercial  Areas, Nightlife areas, Leisure areas and Residential areas. It  was validated that there was a strong correspondence between  land uses and the infrastructures included in the geographical  representation of each cluster.  Using the k-means clustering,  the authors were able to detect volume anomalies in real  network traffic, achieving satisfactory results. K-means  clustering has been applied in [9, 10] for anomaly detection in  traffic data. The data contains unlabeled flow records, which  k-means algorithm separates into clusters of normal and  anomalous traffic. The authors in [11] utilize agglomerative  hierarchical clustering to perform segmentation and  anomaly/outlier detection from a single dendrogram, utilizing  Pearson correlation as distance function. Rule based approach  has been utilized in [12] have been for detecting anomaly  CDR information generated from wireless network. However,    1551-3203 (c) 2016 IEEE.

This article has been accepted for publication in a future issue of this journal, but has not been fully edited. Content may change prior to final publication. Citation information: DOI 10.1109/TII.2017.2650206, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics   study in [12] overlooks the effect of non-travelling users in the  analysis, which is a common case in business areas. On the  contrary in this paper, we first categorize the call activity  information into different clusters. This in turn helps to  identify the un-natural behavior in the activity on a particular  date and time, which further can be traced back for root cause  analysis. Few similar works along with security concern are  also presented in [13-16].

Run-time data analysis and solution are the other  perspective of big data analytics approach. To cope with the  rapidly changing network and user behavior, networks needs  to perform not only adaptive but also agile. And to achieve  that, networks are required to analyze the real data and provide  solution in real time and in time-efficient manner. Towards  this, some interesting examples can be found in [17-19]. This  becomes more important when the user is mobile such as in  vehicular communication as discussed by these papers [17-  19]. A similar example on data analytics scheme for water  sustainability has also been discussed in [20].

Motivated from above works, we chose clustering based  approaches to detect anomalies. However, our work  distinguishes from all above works with the fact that they are  limited to detecting anomalies whereas we move a step further  to extract the meaning and cause of those anomalies so that  appropriate action can be taken such as proactive resource  allocation or cell outage avoidances as discussed earlier in  Section I. Additionally, we evaluate the effect of anomalous  data by using it for prediction over a neural-network based  prediction model. And we observe that the prediction error  decreases by significant amount after making the data  anomaly-free. Thus the ultimate objective is circled around  detection of anomalies and to see its effect on normal  operation of a mobile wireless network. Using above concept,  when the network observes any abnormal behavior in its  operation, it identifies them as anomalies. Moreover, these  kind of approaches are crucial for efficient 5G network  applications where accuracy precision are extremely important  such as health care, defense etc.



III. SYSTEM MODEL AND DATASET PREPROCESSING  The system model basically consists of LTE-Advanced  cellular network. The overall LTE-A network architecture  with network elements and the standardized interfaces is  shown in Fig. 1. At a high level, the network has three layers;  the user end (UE), the access network (E-UTRAN) and the  core network (CN). The UE consists of only the user mobile  devices; the access network is also made up of essentially just  one node, the evolved-NodeB (eNodeB) to which UE  connects. The CN on the other hand, consists of many logical  nodes such as mobility management entity (MME), service  gateway (SGW), packet data network gateway (PGW) etc.

The CDR information is collected at CN layer of the network.

We utilize this data to understand user and network activity  and determine anomaly therein.

A. Description of the Dataset  The CDR dataset used in this paper was obtained from real  network Telecom Italia that had been made publicly available  as part of Big Data Challenge 2014 competition [21]. This  dataset provides information about the telecommunication  activity over the city of Milan. The Milan region is divided  into 100 ? 100 square grids which are named as Milan Grid.

Each grid has side length of ?0.235 km? and an area of 0.055  km2. The dataset contained separate files for different  activities such as Inbound Call, Outbound Call, Inbound SMS  and Outbound SMS from every grid with time interval of 10  minute over a day for the duration of a week.

The CDR dataset contained the following fields before  preprocessing.

? Square ID: This indicates the identification number of the square grids.

? Time Stamp: In the raw dataset, data were recorded over an interval of 10 minute.

? Inbound Call Activity: It indicates the duration of the inbound call at a particular grid within time stamp of 10 minute.

? Outbound Call Activity: It indicates the duration of the outbound call at a particular grid within time stamp of 10 minute.

? Inbound SMS Activity: It indicates the duration of the inbound SMS at a particular grid within time stamp of 10 minute.

? Outbound SMS Activity: It indicates the duration of the outbound SMS at a particular grid within time stamp of 10 minute.

B. Dataset Preprocessing  The dataset provided by the telecom service provider were  in raw form that we preprocessed before analyzing them. The  preprocessing phase consist of cleaning and filtering of data in  order to avoid the generation of misleading and inappropriate  rules or patterns as discussed in earlier section. The  irregularities in the data can be in the form of noise, missing  data fields in some of the data records etc. We utilized Apache  Pig tool on Hadoop based data processing architecture. Since  the sizes of the data were large, Hadoop served as ultimate  choice for time efficient processing of large dataset. For  details on Apache Pig and Hadoop architecture, please refer to  detailed tutorial explained in [22].

This article has been accepted for publication in a future issue of this journal, but has not been fully edited. Content may change prior to final publication. Citation information: DOI 10.1109/TII.2017.2650206, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics   The dataset were aggregated to one-hour intervals, which  were for only 10 minutes before processing. Next, we  combined the separate datasets corresponding to the grids,  date and time into one single dataset. We transformed the  datasets in such a way that various information about a  particular grid such as multiple calls and SMS activities on a  particular date and time could be done in simple few steps. In  other words, combining the dataset made the data processing  and its investigation easy and smooth. Additionally, it  decreased the required memory and processing resources of  the data mining algorithms.

After uniting the separate dataset, the final dataset looks as  shows in Fig. 3. In the final dataset, we summed up the  Inbound and Outbound Call and SMS activities at every grid  and named them as Activity at that grid. It is because; this  shows the combined call and text activity by the user at every  grid at every time step. Once we acquired aggregated activity  of each grid, we use this to identify anomalies in the data. In  the next section, we discuss about the machine learning  algorithms that we utilized to detect the anomalies that we  later remove to make the dataset anomaly-free. In the  following section, we explain the machine learning algorithms  that were applied to anomalies.



IV. ANOMALY DETECTION ALGORITHMS  Anomalies represent the behavior of the network, which is  different than what is usually expected and observed. In the  following we discuss the four machine learning algorithms  detailing how do they detect anomalies.

C. K-means clustering  K-means is one of the simplest unsupervised clustering  methods utilized to solve well-known clustering problems  especially for large datasets. It belongs to the category of  partitioning methods in which a database containing n objects  is partitioned into set of k clusters. It assumes fixed number of  cluster k known a priori. Determining optimal value of k in  itself differs dataset to dataset and method to method.

However, for dataset under consideration, the optimal number  of cluster was determined using Elbow method [23]. After  determining k, the main task involves finding partition of k  clusters that optimizes the chosen partitioning criterion. Given  the input to the algorithm is k, the k-means algorithm partition  given dataset into k clusters so that the resulting intra-cluster  homogeneity is high and inter-cluster homogeneity is low.

Cluster similarity is measured in terms of mean value of the  objects in a cluster, which is usually cluster?s centroid or  center of gravity.

The k-means algorithms clustering can be summarized in  following few steps.

i. Choose randomly the initial value of k from the space represented by the objects being clustered. The values of k represent the initial values of the centroids of k clusters  ii. Compare the distance of each of the objects to each of the centroid, and assign the object to the cluster with closest centroid  iii. Recalculate the centroid of clusters by finding the mean value of the new cluster formed in step (ii)  iv. Repeat steps (ii) and (iii) until the centroids become stationary  After clustering through k-means, the cluster containing the  fewest number of objects are considered to be anomaly. There  are many other ways to detect an anomaly after grouping them  into k clusters. Since the activity of the user at a grid is always  changing based on events and occasion, date and time,  anomaly will be detected only when there is unexpectedly  high rises in their activity. And such activities are observed to  be fewer and will be grouped into a different cluster by k-  means. Thus the cluster containing only few objects we  identify to be anomalous.

D. Hierarchical Clustering  The Hierarchical clustering is also a partition-based  clustering method as k-means. It makes a hierarchy of clusters  for which it takes either bottom-up (agglomerative) approach  or top-down (divisive) approach. The agglomerative approach  treats each object as a singleton clusters and then successively  merges pairs of clusters until all clusters are merged into a  single cluster that contains all objects.  On the other hand, the  divisive clustering considers the whole objects a single cluster    Fig. 2. Dataset before preprocessing        Fig. 3. Dataset after preprocessing    1551-3203 (c) 2016 IEEE.

Citation information: DOI 10.1109/TII.2017.2650206, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics   and then splits them recursively until all individual objects are  a single luster. The agglomerative is more frequently used  than the divisive approach.

The Hierarchical clustering approach can be described in  following few steps.

i. We start by considering each object into its own cluster.

Therefore, for n number of objects, there will be n number of clusters.

ii. The distance between those individual clusters are calculated and the closest (most similar) pair of clusters are merged into a single cluster. So now we have one less cluster.

iii. Then we compute the distances (similarities) between the new made clusters and each of the old clusters.

We repeat steps (ii) and (iii) until all items are clustered into a  single cluster. However, step (iii) is performed in different  ways that are called single-link, complete-link and average-  link type of hierarchical clustering. We utilized average-link  clustering which consider the distance between one cluster and  another cluster to be equal to the average distance from any  member of one cluster to any member of the other cluster. For  more on single-link, complete-link and average-link  clustering, please refer to [23 - 26].

E. Complexity Analyses of K-means and Hierarchical Clustering  As we know, the time complexity of k-means is linear in  the number of data objects, i.e. O(kn), where k is number of  cluster, n is number of data objects. However, the time  complexity of the hierarchical clustering algorithms is  quadratic, i.e. O(n2logn). Therefore, for the same amount of  data, hierarchical clustering will take quadratic amount of  time.

The space complexity of k-means algorithm is O(k + n),  where again k is number of cluster and n is number of data  objects. The space complexity of hierarchical clustering is  O(n2), which is quite higher than k-means clustering. Thus  space complexity of hierarchical clustering is a limiting factor  for large data set processing.

From above discussion, we conclude that k-means has  lesser time as well as space complexity than hierarchical  clustering especially for large datasets. However, k-means  starts with a random choice of cluster centers, therefore it may  yield different clustering results on different runs of the  algorithm. Thus, the results may not be repeatable and lack  consistency. Hierarchical clustering on the other hand  definitely results in same clusters after several repetitions thus  maintains consistency. Therefore, there exists trade-off in their  performance. In other words, for lesser complexity, k-means  clustering is better whereas for better performance hierarchical  clustering is better. In our experiments both performances  were almost same with higher than 90% accuracy.



V. INVESTIGATION AND VERIFICATION OF ANOMALIES  In this section, we present the anomalies detected through  machine learning algorithms explained above. We first  investigate the data by plotting in its original form to check if  there are anomalies occurring at any grid on any date and  time. After this visual check, we find anomalies through the  algorithms which we verify by matching the anomalies  detected in a grid for a given, date and time.

Fig. 4. Activity plot and anomaly investigation  Table 1.  Anomalous activity and the corresponding grids       A n o m alies    Fig. 5.

This article has been accepted for publication in a future issue of this journal, but has not been fully edited. Content may change prior to final publication. Citation information: DOI 10.1109/TII.2017.2650206, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics   1) Investigating the anomalies through ground truth data  ?   Figure 4 shows the activity of the user at the grids 5638 ?  5642 collected over a week. Looking at the user activity trend  over a week, it can be noticed that the activity level are quite  higher in the beginning and slightly higher towards the middle  of the plot. Since those activity level exhibit abnormal  behavior of the network, they are counted to be anomalies.

While investigating those anomalies corresponding to their  grids, it is found that it was Sunday and the anomalies  occurred between 2 PM and 4 PM as shown in Table 1. The  grids at which the anomalies observed were nearby stadium in  which at 3 PM, there was a huge soccer match held. This is  not surprising that when there is such big event, there is  presence of thousands of people each of them texting, calling  and sharing multimedia contents. Thus it leads to surge in  traffic flow showing an abnormal behavior in the network.

Anomaly detection in such a case helps in identifying regions  of interests (ROI) which can be stadiums, hospitals,  universities, exhibition centers etc., for which network can be  planned and resource can be allocated in advance for  uninterrupted provision of the service. The other anomalies in  the small circle have been observed when it was 9 PM at few  of the grids, which is relatively higher and that was due to  busy hour. As compared to the anomalies in the first case, this  may or may not be considered anomaly depending upon types  of data and the expected behavior.

2) Anomalies detected through machine learning  algorithms ? The anomalies found through k-means and  hierarchical clustering methods are shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6  respectively. We considered that the anomalous activity  objects are unique than the objects exhibiting normal activity,  thus will be grouped into separate cluster. Since normal  operation exhibits common/normal characteristics, they will  be grouped into a cluster against the abnormal activities that  are mostly few in number lie in a separate cluster. Thus the  clusters with fewest members are considered to be containing  anomalous activities. As shown in Fig. 5, there are three  clusters, each containing activities most of the objects lying  within an activity range, e.g. objects of activity level 50-250  are grouped into cluster 1, activity level 1-50 are grouped into  cluster 2 and the rests in cluster 3. From the activity level, we  observe that most of the user?s activities are represented by  cluster 1 and cluster 2 whereas cluster 3 contains less number  of users with higher activity level. This is against the trend  shown by (most) users in cluster 1 and cluster 2.  Intuitively,  this indicates an abnormal trend and thus they have been  categorized into anomalies. Similarly, cluster 2 found through  hierarchical clustering has fewest members as shown in Fig 6.

When the objects in those clusters were verified against the  anomalies found through ground truth data, their activity level  matched with those of the anomalies.

In case of user-centric, proactive and automated 5G  networks operation, user and network behavior analysis as  well as its exact prediction are the backbone of efficient  network operation. To enable that, intelligent prediction  models are being developed that heavily depends upon precise  information and correct data ? also known as veracity.

Anomalous data can pose minor to major threat on wireless  network operation. For example, there is an intelligent model  developed to forecast/understand user?s future demand in a  network. If the model has not been trained with clean and  anomaly-free data, it will not forecast the future demand  correctly. But this pose a minor threat as the user will still be  served with at least average quality of service. Thus  anomalous data might result in minor threat. However, an  intelligent model developed to predict/detect fault occurrence  (or a sleeping cell [25]) in the network does not perform  correctly then there may occur network outage affecting large  number of customers, eventually resulting in churn. In the  next, we observe the effect of anomalous and anomaly-free  data by passing it through a neural network based prediction  model and observing the error difference.



VI. FORECASTING ACTIVITY LEVELS  After detecting and locating the anomalies (anomalous  activities), we replace those anomalous activities by average  activities of all the users to make the data anomaly-free. We  do this for the sake of performance evaluation. Now we have  earlier data (which is anomalous) and the latest data, the data  we just made anomaly-free.

Using these data, we train a neural-network based  forecasting model to observe the difference in error. We  passed activity data of users corresponding to six days at one  of the square grid. In the case of this grid, we already have  information about the anomalies and its whereabouts through  ground truth observation. Thus we understand that utilizing  data corresponding to this grid will help in assessing the  performance. We observed the effect on mean square error  (MSE) caused in prediction of the model after passing  anomalous and anomaly-free data. Figure 7 and Fig. 8 presents  the MSE observed in the prediction model using data with and  without anomalies respectively. It is observed that, the MSE  for training data, validation data as well as test data are  significantly higher when the prediction model acted upon the  data with anomalies. However, when the same model acted  upon anomaly-free data, the overall MSE significantly   Fig. 6. Anomaly detection through Hierarchical clustering    1551-3203 (c) 2016 IEEE.

Moreover, there are many differences observed in  MSE among the training, validation and test data when the  prediction model was passed anomalous data. Additionally,  the error difference among the training, validation and test  data after removing the anomalies decreased.

Further, the impact of the MSE on the performance of the  model can be severe depending upon the target of the model.

For example, consider there is a model designed to detect a  sleeping cell in the network. If the model is unable to detect  the sleeping cell because of anomalous data it was trained  with, then the network service will be heavily affected  eventually leading to churn. In the case of 5G networks and  beyond, there will be thousands of nodes, many of them co-  operating with each other. In such a case, along with  intelligent design of system, accuracy and speed of the data  and its processing will play vital role. Thus ensuring the data  anomaly-free is extremely important

VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK  In this paper we presented anomaly detection in mobile  network big data (Call Detail Record: CDR) using machine-  learning (clustering) technique. We analyzed user activities at  different time and location from the spatio-temporal  information contained within CDR. Using k-means and  hierarchical clustering techniques. The user activities that  were unusually high caused unusual traffic demand and thus  were categorized into anomalies. Further, after verifying these  anomalies with ground truth information, we found that the  location where there was unusual high traffic was a stadium  and at the time when the network experienced high demand,  there was a soccer match going on. And thus the traffic  experienced was higher than on usual days. Thus with the help  of anomaly detection, region of interests (RoI) can be  identified, for which proper action (e.g. proper resource  allocation) can be taken in advance to meet the requirements.

We also discussed the effect of anomalous and anomaly-free  data by experimenting on a prediction model. We found that  training the model with anomaly-free data resulted in less  mean square error than with anomalous data.

This work can be extended to understand the dynamics of  user in envisioned smart cities. Big data analytics approach  can be utilized to understand users? contextual information  such as mobility pattern, traffic pattern, their choice of  contents, their social network and ties etc. By extracting these  insightful information, smart and intelligent resource  allocation algorithms can be developed for efficient resource  utilization. Additionally, data analytics can also be performed  on data collected from energy meters in every home to  understand and appropriately determine energy utilization  pattern in smart cities.
