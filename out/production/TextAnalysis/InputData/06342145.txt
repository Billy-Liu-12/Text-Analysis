3D CAD Model Retrieval Using 2D   Representative Views

Abstract?A novel 3D CAD model retrieval method using 2D representative views is proposed for the reuse of CAD models.

Initially, a set of 2D projected views is generated from multiple viewpoints which are evenly distributed on the viewing sphere of a CAD model. Then, the Apriori algorithm is employed to select the representative views from the set. The similarity between 3D models is determined by the likeness of their corresponding 2D representative views. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

I.  INTRODUCTION 3D-model-based product design and manufacturing has  become the mainstream in current mechanical design and manufacturing field, and has been widely applied to almost all aspects of product developments (CAD, CAE, CAPP, and CAM etc.). Statistics indicate that more than 75% of the design activities in a new product development are the reuse or the minor modifications of the existing designs [1]. Content-based 3D CAD model retrieval can help manufacturing enterprises manage the product design, and reuse the existing designs, so as to improve the design efficiency, shorten the development cycles, and effectively enhance the core competitiveness of the enterprises.

One of the key issues in content-based 3D CAD model retrieval is how to effectively describe the shapes  of 3D models, which has a direct influence upon the precision and the accuracy in retrieval [2]. At present, view-based 3D model retrieval algorithms are considered as the algorithms giving the best retrieval performance [3, 4]. Such approaches represent a 3D model with a set of 2D projected views, following the cognitive process of human vision. In this way, the comparison between 3D models is implemented by comparing their corresponding 2D projected views. If all the 2D projected views are similar, the two models are regarded as similar. The most well-known view-based retrieval algorithm is the light field algorithm reported by Chen etc. in [5]. However, because the algorithm treats all views indiscriminately, it ignores the importance of different views in similarity comparison.

Compared to the other views, some 2D views may contain more information, which means they are more representative than the others and make more contributions in similarity matching. As shown in Fig 1, the front view of the screwdriver  model contains more information than the top view, so the front view is more representative to the model. Li etc. [6] proposed a 3D model retrieval algorithm using the optimal weights of 2D views so as to distinguish the different importance of views in similarity matching. In their method, the weights of views are computed by the Lagrange multiplier and a SVM.

In this paper, a 2D-representative-views-based 3D CAD model retrieval approach is proposed, which addresses the problem of 3D model retrieval by transforming the comparison of two 3D models into similarity matching between their 2D representative projected-views. After generating a set of 2D projected views from multiple viewpoints of a 3D model, the Apriori algorithm is employed to find the representative views in the view set. The similarity between 3D models is then measured by comparing their corresponding 2D representative views.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: the generation of the 2D projections and the selection of the representative views are described respectively in Sec 2 and Sec3.

Experimental results are presented in Sec 4. Finally, we draw conclusions in Sec 5.

II. THE GENERATION OF 2D PROJECTED VIEWS Similar to the other view-based algorithms, the proposed  algorithm also starts by generating 2D projections from multiple viewpoints distributed evenly on the viewing sphere of a 3D CAD model. In order to obtain sufficient view candidates for the selection of the representative views (in Sec 3) at low computational cost, 42 vertices of a given geodesic sphere surrounding a 3D model are used as the viewpoints for     2D projections. Therefore, the 3D model is represented as a set of 2D projected views 1 2 42{ , ,... }I i i i= .

Three functions are applied to describe each view: (1) 2D polar radius Fourier transform, (2) 2D Zernike moment[5], and (3) 2D Krawtchouk moment[7], which yield a new descriptor:  ( , , )i FT Zern KrawD D D D=                          (1)  where DFT, DZern and DKraw denote the 2D polar radius Fourier transforms, the 2D Zernike moment, and the 2D Krawtchouk moment respectively.

III. THE SELECTION OF THE REPRESENTATIVE VIEWS In this paper, a representative view is defined as the view  which is able to represent the other ones in a 2D projection set.

For example, the front projected view of a sphere is a representative view, since it can represent all the other views.

Because the content of a representative view reflects the common shape property of several 2D views, it contains more information than the others. In order to select the representative views in the 2D projection set, the Apriori algorithm is employed.

A. The Apriori algorithm The Apriori algorithm has been widely applied to  Computer Science and Data Mining [8]. In the following section, we briefly introduce its concepts.

Consider 1 2{ , ,..., }nITEM item item item= is a set of literals, called items. Let DATA be a database of transactions, where each transaction T is a subset of ITEM. An association rule is an implication of the form X Y? , where X ITEM? , Y ITEM? , and X Y? ? ? . The support of the association rule is defined as:  ( ) BSupport X A  =              (2)  where A is the total number of transactions in DATA, and B is the number of transactions in DATA containing both X and Y . An item is frequent if it support is greater than a threshold  called minimum support. The confidence of the association rule is defined as:  ( )( ) ( )  Support X YConfidence R Support X  ?=                  (3)  which measures how often item in Y appear in transactions that contain X, i.e. the reliability of the association rule.

The main idea of the Apriori algorithm is to find all frequent items through multiple passes in the transaction set DATA. Firstly, frequent itemsets are acquired according to the minimum support. Then, new association rules are generated based on those itemsets, and are utilized for scanning DATA in later passes. The process is repeated until no new frequent itemsets are discovered.

B. The selection of the representative views Before selecting the representative views in a 2D  projection set, a transaction database DATA.is required to be constructed Initially, the similarity measurement between two 2D projected views is defined as:  '( , ') 1 ( , )i iSim i i dis D D= ?                          (4)  where dis() is the L-2 distance between 2D view descriptors Di and Di?. The distance is normalized to the range [0, 1]. The views i and i? are similar if ( , ')Sim i i  is greater than the given threshold min_ImgSim. Afterwards, for each 2D view, its similar objects are searched in the projection set according to the similarity measurement.  The search results are saved in the database DATA as transactions. As shown in Table 1, DATA is comprised of 42 transactions, the size of which is in accordance with that of the 2D projection set.

TABLE ?   ITEM  DATABASE  D Transaction. Item  1 i1?i2?i5?i9 2 i1?i2?i7    42 i42    The selection of the representative views starts by scanning DATA in the first pass. The support of each item (i.e. the 2D view) in DATA is calculated. The frequent 1-itemsets are then generated by pruning some candidate items if their support values are lower than the minimum support min_support. Next, the frequent 1-itemsets are jointed with each other to build the candidate 2-itemsets, so as to discover the 2-itemsets in the second pass of scanning. This process is repeated until no new frequent itemsets are identified. A frequent itemset denotes a group of 2D views which are similar to each other, and the representative views are those items which have the minimal    Algorithm 1 the selection of the representative views  Input: the transaction database DATA, the threshold of the minimum support min_support  Output: the representative view set of a 3D model C  1 L1 = 1 the frequent 1-itemset  2 for?k=2?Lk-1?k++? do  3 Cank ?

confidence value in each of the frequent itemsets. Algorithm 1 summarizes the workflow of the selection of the representative views.



IV. SIMILARITY MEASUREMENT After selecting the representative views, a 3D model is  represented as a set of 2D representative views C. The similarity between two models is determined by the likeness of their corresponding 2D representative views. Because different representative view sets do not always have the same size, we employ the greedy search approach to counter this problem so as to guarantee the effectiveness of the similarity calculation. Let CM and CQ  are the representative view set of model M and Q respectively, the computation of their similarity is conducted as follows:  Step 1 Let iM Mc C? is a representative view in model M, the set CQ is traversed so as to find the view jQc  which is most  similar to view iMc . The distance between i Mc and  u Qc  is  defined as:  ( , ) min( ( , ))i j i rmat M Q M QrD c c dis Dc Dc=                (5)     0.1  0.2  0.3  0.4  0.5  0.6  0.7  0.8  0.9   0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1  Recall  P r e c i s i o n  Our method  OWD  LFD   Figure 3.

Step 2 Step 1 is repeated until the views in either of the representative view sets are all matched successfully. During this procedure, the views ,which are already  matched, are not allowed to be participated into calculation again. Therefore, the similarity measurement of two models M and Q is defined as:    ( , ) 1- N  n Sim M Q D  =  = ?                           (6)  where min( , )N s r= , s and r are the size of MC  and QC . D is the L-2 distance between the views matched successfully.



V. EXPERIMENTS To evaluate the retrieval performance of the proposed  method, we employ OpenCASCADE [10] as the visualization platform and build a prototype system for 3D CAD model retrieval. More than 400 3D CAD models from the Engineering Shape Benchmark (ESB) [4] are used as the experiment database. Those models are classified into 19 categories including gear-like parts, discs, cylindrical parts, etc. In our experiments, we use the 2D projected-images size of 256 by 256. The minimum similarity min_ImgSim for determining whether two projected-views are similar is set to 70%, while the minimum support min_support for selecting the representative views is set to 50%.

The precision and recall curve (P-R Curve) and the E- Measures [3] are employed as the performance evaluation. We compare the proposed method with the following two approaches: the light field algorithm (LFD) [5], and the algorithms reported in [6] (OWD).

The experimental results (as shown n Figure 3, Table 2) clearly    TABLE ??

We also present a retrieval example for the class ?discs? shown in Table 2. The proposed method obtains more accurate results than the others in the example.



VI. COLNCULSIONS In this paper, a novel 3D CAD model retrieval method  using 2D representative views is proposed. After the generation of the projected views and the selection of the representative views, the proposed method represent a 3D model as a set of 2D representative views. The similarity retrieval between 3D models is conducted by comparing their corresponding representative views. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method, which is superior to the competing methods.
