Discovering Association Strength among Brand Loyalties from  Purchase History

Abstract  Analyzing purchase history of customers enables us to discover valuable knowledge that is helpful for develop- ing effective sales promotion. In this respect, we shall introduce a new notion, association strength among brand loyalties, which is defined for every ordered pair of brands. If the association strength between loyalties of brands A and B is high, it represents that purchase of brand A is highly correlated to that of brand B.

Conventional method for discovering associative pur- chasing is usually applied for one purchase opportunity (one receipt), i.e., it reveals how often two commodities are purchased a t  the same time. On the other hand, we are interested in discovering relationship among cus- tomers? loyalties t o  certain brands or manufacturers by investigating long-term purchase history of customers.

By computing association strengths from customers? purchase history of drugstore chain in Japan, we could produce several interesting rules that will be useful for sales promotion planning.

1. Introduction  According to the rapid development of modern com- puter technologies, there has been much progress made in automating daily office work. This, in turn, has re- sulted in the accumulation of a huge amount of business data into databases. However, it does not seem that most companies can make full use of such accumulated data for strategic planning of their future business.

On the other hand, knowledge discovery zn databases or data mzning has become an active research area in which new technologies or methodologies are sought to automatically extract meaningful knowledge from busi- ness data [l, 7, 81.

One of the fundamental techniques in data mining is association d e .  A typical application of association rule is to discover rules of associative purchasing by  analyzing data accumulated from POS(point of sales) terminals. For supermarkets or drugstores, customers purchase several items at  one time. By investigating receipts issued by POS terminals, we can find how often two commodities are purchased a t  the same time. This information, for instance, helps to  construct effective location of commodities in a store.

If purchase history of customers are available, we can discover much more valuable knowledge that can be helpful for constructing effective marketing strategy [2, 3,  5, 41. For instance, we can measure brand loyalty, or for customers who are loyal to a certain brand we can find to what brands in other commodity categories such customers have loyalty. Such information can be used in promotion sales planning such as effective cross-sell  In this respect, we shall introduce a new notion, as- soczatzon strength among brand loyalties, which is de- fined for every ordered pair of brands. If the association strength of brand A to brand B is high, it represents that loyalties of brands A and B are highly correlated.

Conventional method for discovering associative pur- chasing is usually applied for one purchase opportunity (one receipt), i.e., it reveals how often two commodities are purchased at  the same time. On the other hand, we are interested in finding correlation between loyalties of two brands. If customers with high loyalty to a brand A in category C are usually loyal to other brand B in category D, it indicates that there exists some reason behind such phenomenon. Such correlation provides us with useful customer knowledge. For example, if both brands are made by the same manufacturer, we can infer that there may exist high loyalty to the manu- facturer. If manufacturers of brands A and B are dif- ferent although the manufacturer of brand A produces brand B? which belongs to the same category as that of brand B. This indicates that the manufacturer of brands A and B? should carry out effective sales pro- motion so as to increase the number of customers who purchase both A and B?. In this manner, by computing  12, 61.

We have carried out computational experiments by using customers' purchase history of drugstore chain in Japan in order to observe whether we can produce interesting rules that will be useful for developing ef- fective sales promotion.

The organization of this paper is as follows. Sec- tion 2 rigorously defines association strength, and Sec- tion 3 reports computational experiments. Section 4 concludes the paper and mentions future research.

2. Association Strength among Brands in Purchase History  customer 2 customer 3  total  Suppose that there are two commodity categories, say, laundry detergent (category L) and dish-washing detergent (category D )  and that there are three manu- facturers M I ,  Mz, M3 each of which produce one brand in both categories. Let A, and B, for each i = 1 ,2 ,3 denote the brands in categories C and ID respectively which are produced by manufacturer M,. Suppose also that there are three customers who bought brands A, and B, in their purchase history (Table 1 shows the number of items of each brand purchased by customers).

For cus- tomer 1, assuming that the numbers of items of cate- gories C and D which he/she purchases are the same (notice from Table 1 that such numbers are different, i.e., 15 C items and 24 D items), let us consider the conditional probability PI (B1 I A I )  representing how many items of brand B1 the customer purchases per purchase of one item of brand A l .  Here the subscript 1 of PI stands for the customer number. I t  is natu- ral to regard that Pl(B1 I AI) is independent of A1 since the only information available is Table 1. That  is, Pl(B1 I A I )  = Pl(B1) which is equal t o  his/her brand share in category D (= 20/24). Now reflecting that the total number of items of categories L and V are 15 and 24, 10 items of brand A1 out of 15 category C items are purchased by customer 1, we consider that the customer 1 purchased 10.24/15 (= 16) D items in association with the purchases of 10 C items. Among 16 D items, 16 . Pl(B1) = 13.33 items is expected to be of brand B1. Thus, it is reasonable to consider that 13.33 B1 items have been purchased in association with brand A l .

Seeing the last row Table 1, you may naturally consider that for the average customer the conditional probability Paue(B1 I A I )  is equal to Pave(B1) = 32/77.

However, it does not seem to suitably reflect the overall purchase behaviour because there is a positive correla- tion of the purchase of A1 and that of B1 as seen from Table 1. Then, what is the best estimated value of Paue(B1 I A I ) ?  We shall define it as the the value x* that minimizes the squared error from P,(B1) weighted by the purchase frequency, i.e., x* is computed as the solution of  where i ranges over all customers, a , ( A l )  and P,(B1) denote the number of items of brand A1 purchased by customer i and the brand share of customer i for B1, and a,(L) (resp. a, (D))  denotes the ratio of the number of C (resp. 2)) commodity purchased by customer i to the total sales volume of commodities of C (resp. D ) .

It  is easy to see that  c, az(Al):,::) dP, (Bi) x* = c az(A1) *  Such z* is denoted by Paue(B1 1 A l )  (expected condi- tional purchase probability of B1 with respect to A I ) .

is defined as Association strength of A1 on B1 (denoted by as(A1, B1))  as(A1, B1) = z* / share (Bl ) ,  where share(B1) denotes the share of B1 in category D. F'rom Table 1, as (A1 ,Bl )  = 0.622/0.416 = 1.50. In the same manner, We can compute as(A, ,  B3)  for all i and j ,  and we can also can compute as(&, A3) for all i and j .  Intuitively, if as (A , ,B , )  > 1, brand loyalties  115 ISIE 2001, Pusan, KOREA    n Baby Diaper  Total Score. 10.05  Fig. 1: A triple of brands that attain the highest score  of A, and B, are positively correlated. otherwise it is negatively correlated.

We can extend the notion of association strength to  a Ic-tuple of brands which are all belong to distinct commodity category. It is defined simply as the sum of association strengths for all ordered pair of brands.

3. Computational Experiments  In order to  observe whether we can obtain interest- ing rules by computing association strengths, we per- form computational experiments using POS data accu- mulated in drugstore chain in Japan [3]. Our experi- ments used 252,761 customers and 750 categories. The average number of brands per category is 15.

Because the space limit, we only give two interesting results.

(1) For every triple of categories and for every triple of brands each from distinct category, we have com- puted association strengths. One of the brand triples that  attained highest score is illustrated in Fig.1. The corresponding thrce categories are baby diaper, san- itary napkin for regular use and sanitarymapkin for night use. Brands shown in the figure are those whose prices are relatively low and frequently sold at discount price. We may see that customers who are loyal to  these brands are loyal to  their prices, but not t o  brands.

(2) We did a similar experiment for 5-tuple of c a t 0 gories as shown in Table 2. a, b and c in parentheses stand for manufacturers. Three tuples of brands are those which attain highest scores among all combina- tions of brands in this set of five categories. As seen  from Table 2, the second tuple indicates that there are certain fraction of customers who are loyal to  brands all from manufacturer b. The other two tuples indicate that manufacturers a and c are not strong in category of liquid laundry detergent. This may be useful infor- mation for these two manufacturers.

4. Conclusion and Future Work In this paper, we have introduced a new notion, as-  sociation strength among brand loyalties. From com- putational experiments using real POS data of drug- store chain, we found interesting rules that  can be use- ful in future promotion sales planning. We are plan- ning to carry out further computational experiments using various POS data  in order t o  see how association strengths among brand and manufacturer loyalties can be utilized in sales promotion planning of real business.
