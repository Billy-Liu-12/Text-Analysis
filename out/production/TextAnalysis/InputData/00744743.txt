Introduction  Medical databases have accumulated large quantities of information about patients and their medical conditions. While technological advancements in the form of computer-based patient record software and personal computer hardware are making the collection of and access to health care data more manageable, few tools exist to evaluate and analyse this clinical data after it has been captured and stored. Evaluation of stored clinical data may lead to the discovery of trends and patterns hidden within the data that could significantly enhance our understanding of disease progression and management. Techniques are needed to search large quantities of climcal data for these patterns and relationships. In this study the techniques of data mining were used to search for relationships in large clinical databases.

Data mining, also referred to as Knowledge Discovery in Databases is the nontrivial extraction of implicit, previously unknown, and potentially useful information from data [l]. In other words, it is the search for relationships and global patterns that exist in large databases, but are ?hidden? among the vast amount of data, such as a relationship between patient data and medical hagnosis. These relationships represent valuable knowledge about the database and objects in it and (if the database is a faithful mirror) of the real world registered by the database.

Data mining techniques have rarely been applied to medical domain. GTE Laboratories built a large data mining system that evaluated health-care utilisation to identify intervention strategies that were likely to cut costs. This system, however, is focused on cost analysis and not on identifying new associations or relationships within clinical data[2]. Data mining techniques are also used for improving birth outcomes[3] and automated detection of hereditary Syndromes[4].

We are currently in the process of experimenting a data mining project at UMIST using an extensive clinical database of stroke patients fiom East Lancashire[S], [6] to identify factors that contribute to this disease. EasyMiner is our data mining system designed and developed in Timelab research laboratory at UMIST for interactive mining of interesting patterns in time-oriented medical databases. This system implements a wide spectrum of data mining functions, including generalisation, relevance analysis, classification and discovery of association rules The eventual goal of this data mining effort is to identify factors that will improve the quality and cost effectiveness of patients care. In the following sections we describe briefly the EasyMiner data mining approaches.

2. Generalisation  EasyMiner uses generalisation rules as they are defined in [7].  By using these rules, values of the attributes are generalised at multiple concept levels. As a result of this process, a set of attributes is generated for every generalised attribute of the original data set. The generated attributes are instances of the same attribute but in different concept levels. In order to determine which of these attributes (concept levels) is most appropriate to the required data-mining task, relevance analysis is applied on them and only the one that is most relevant to the specific data-mining task is kept. In EasyMiner there are several procedures for the automatic generation of generalisation rules for numeric attributes.

Examples of obvious relevancies amongst database attributes is ?Age? to ?Date of birth? and ?Title? to ?Sex? and ?Marital Status?. This kind of knowledge is qualitative and it is quite usehl to mine from large databases that hold information about many objects (fields). For example a bank could look in its data and identify the factors that it should consider in order to give a credit limit to a customer. Applying Easy Miner to our credit history database revealed that Credit Limit is relevant to Account Status, Monthly Expenses, Marital Status, Monthly Income and Gender  4. Classification  Classification is an important area of research in data mining. Classification partitions massive quantities of data into sets of common characteristics and properties[9]. In classification a set of records, acting as training set, is analysed in order to produce a model of the given data. Each record is assumed to belong to a predefined class, as determined by one of the attributes, called cZasszfiiing attribute. Table 1 shows a part from a sample training set of the medical database, where each record represents a patient and Lived is the classzfiing attribute of the training set.

Once derived, the classification model can be used to categorise future data samples, as well as providing a better understanding of the database contents. Classification is particularly useful when a database contains examples that can be used as the basis for future decision making, e.g. for assessing credit risks, for medical diagnosis, or for scientific data analysis.

By using a decision tree, untagged data sample can be classified by testing the attribute values of the sample data against the decision tree. A path is produced fiom the root to a leaf node, which has the class identification of the sample.

5. Association Rules  Agrawal describes discovery of association rules in large databases in [lo]. The initial motivation for association rules was to aid in the analysis of large transaction databases, such as those collected by supermarkets. The discovery of associations between various line items can potentially aid decision making within organisations. Using the formalism provided by Agrawal, association rules can be defined as follows.

Let I={il, i2,..,im} be a set of items. Let DB be a database of transactions, where each transaction T  consists of a set of items such that T c I .  Given an itemset X E I ,  a transaction T contains X only and only if X E T . An association rule is an implication of the form X 3 Y, where X E I , Y c I and X n Y = 0. The association rule X Y holds in DB with confidence c if the probability  7/2    of a transaction in DB which contains X also contains Y is c. The association rule X a Y has support s in DB if the probability of a transaction in DB contains both X and Y is s. The task of mining association rules is to find all the association rules whose support is larger than a minimum support threshold 6,? and whose confidence is larger than a minimum confidence threshold o ,? . We use the semantic characteristic of decision trees to develop a method for finding association rules from a database. The rules that our method discovers have the form: X s Y , where X is a set of conditions upon the values of several attributes and Y a specific value of one attribute or a combination of several attributes? values. This attribute (or combination of attributes) Y is called target attribute. The method for mining association rules consist of 3 simple steps including Data Preparation, Generation of rules and Selection of strong rules.
