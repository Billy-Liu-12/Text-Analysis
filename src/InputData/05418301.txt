SURFACE PARAMETERS RETRIEVAL FROM ALLUVIAL FAN IN EJINA AREA OF INNER  MONGOLIA USING MULTI-POLARIZATION SAR DATA

Abstract: This paper presents the method of retrieving surface  parameters of alluvial fan using multi-polarization SAR data based  on Genetic Algorithm combined with backscattering models. The  comparison of simulated results and field measurements shows that  the method is efficient for surface parameters retrieval from alluvial  fan. This method presented that the cross function of surface  parameters inversion could be variable with the amount of data  acquired. The data used for surface parameters inversion must be  more than two scenes. The more data could generate the more  accurate results. Then the surface parameters of alluvial fan in Ejina  area of Inner Mongolia were estimated using ENVISAT ASAR and  ALOS PALSAR data. The estimation results shows the ground  surface of Ejina alluvial fan is very flat, so the range of its  roughness is small, and the root mean squared heights in most party  of the alluvial fan are no more than 1.0cm. The roughness in the  area along Heihe River is big, and it is very small in the other areas  far from Heihe River. The estimation result of soil moisture shows  this area is very arid, and the soil volume moisture in most party is  no more than 10%.

Key words: surface parameters, inversion, alluvial fan,  multi-polarization SAR  INTRODUCTION  The surface parameters of alluvial fan consist of roughness and  moisture. It is very important to show the characteristics and  formation of alluvial fan using these parameters. Synthetic aperture  radar (SAR) is sensitive to surface texture and roughness, so it is a  power tool to retrieve the surface parameters of alluvial fan. Some  researchers studied the alluvial fan using SAR data, such as Farr  and Chadwick[1], Wang and Guo [2]. But they only obtained the  preliminary results, and have not validated the inversion results  using the field measurements. The alluvial fan in Ejina area of Inner  Mongolia is one of the biggest alluvial fan in the Eastern  Hemisphere. Direct measurement of surface parameters can be  impractical and expensive, so it is necessary to develop techniques  that estimate the surface parameters based on scattering models and  inversion algorithm.

Many semi-empirical and physical models have been developed for  the estimation of roughness and moisture from SAR data [3-13].

The physical approach uses a backscattering model capable of  reproducing the radar signal from radar parameters regardless of  surface parameters (moisture and roughness for bare surface). The  Integral Equation Model (IEM) is one of the models most widely  used in inversion procedures for retrieving soil moisture and  roughness parameters [4, 11]. The second approach is empirical,  based on a large set of experimental data, in order to establish  experimental relationships linking the backscattering coefficient to  surface parameters and the instrumental parameters of radar sensors  [5-9]. However, it is difficult to obtain the analytic expressions of  surface parameters from the backscattering models due to the  complexity of backscattering models, so an independent estimation  of surface parameters is not possible by using only the method  seeking for numerical solution. Genetic Algorithms (GA) are a very  effective way of quickly finding a reasonable solution to a complex  problem, and have ability to obtain a group of the global optimal  parameters [14-16]. Herein, this paper presents the method of  retrieving surface parameters of alluvial fan using multi-polarization  SAR data based on GA combined with backscattering model. In this  study, the surface parameters of the alluvial fan were estimated  using multi-polarization ALOS PALSAR and ENVISAT ASAR data  based on GA and semi-empirical model (Oh model). The surface  parameters of the measurement sites over alluvial fan were  validated by the estimation values based on the IEM and Oh models  and GA.

MATERIALS AND METHODS  Study site  The study site is located in Ejina area of northwestern Inner  Mongolia. The alluvial fan in the study site was formed by alluvial  sediments of the Heihe River. The geographical coordinate of the  alluvial fan are between 40?~43?N and 99?~101?E, and located in  south of Mid-Asian desert. The area has extraordinary continental  climate that is intensely hot in summer and bitterly cold in winter.

The annual average precipitation is 37mm, and annual evaporation  is 3841.5mm. The coefficient of wetness is 0.011. An oasis, which  has a vast tract of natural secondary and artificial forest such as  Populus diversifolia, Elaegnus angustifolia, Haloxylon  ammodendron etc., is located in the lower reaches of the Heihe  River. The ground surface consists mainly of desert and Gobi. The  Gobi is mainly measurement of surface parameters of alluvial fan.

Ground measurement of roughness  Field measurements took approximately during the satellite  overpass. Since the climate of the study area is dry, and the ground  soils have little moisture, so the main measurement of surface  parameters is roughness. Surface roughness for 10 sample sites was  measured using a pinmeter of 1.2-m profile length. Each sample site  is located by the GPS receiver. The pinmeter traced the surface  roughness for 3-5 profiles in each sample site, and which were  digitized and root mean squared height (s) and correlation length (l)  were extracted. However, there is evidence that s measurements are  more accurate than l measurements [17, 18], so we only used the s  measurements.

SAR data processing  SAR data used in the study consist of ALOS PALSAR and  ENVISAT ASAR data acquired in September-October 2007. The  pixel spacing of these data is 12.5 12.5m. The imaging parameters  of SAR data are given in Table 1. The SAR images were  geometrically registered using optical image supplied by Google  Earth. A Lee filter consisting of a 3-pixel moving window was  applied for speckle reduction. Since the sites selected for this study  were relatively flat, this correction for topography was not applied  for this study. The image digital numbers (DN) were converted to  decibel values (dB) using the calibration formula supplied by the  header files of the SAR data.

Genetic Algorithm and backscattering models  GA and backscattering models were used for the inversion of  surface parameters of alluvial fan. The GA works like this: a  population is created with a group of individuals created randomly.

The individuals in the population are then evaluated. The evaluation  function is provided by the programmer and gives the individuals a  score based on how well they perform at the given task. Two  individuals are then selected based on their fitness, the higher the  fitness, the higher the chance of being selected. These individuals  then "reproduce" to create one or more offspring, after which the  offspring are mutated randomly. This continues until a suitable  solution has been found or a certain number of generations have  passed, depending on the needs of the programmer. So the objective  of GA is to create the cross function based on different problems. In  this study, the cross function of the inversion of the surface  parameters can be expressed as  kjikji F  theorypqrealpq ,,,,1  _  _  (1)  32,1,22,1,121 nknjni  Where F is cross function. The subscript pq represents polarization  configuration for HH, VV or HV. is the backscattering  coefficients extracted from the SAR images, and is the  backscattering coefficients modeled by the backscattering models.

The i, j, k are for radar band, incidence angle and polarization,  respectively, and n1, n2, n3 are their amounts.

_ realpq  _ theorypq  The backscattering models used for this study are Oh model and  III - 499    IEM model. According to the Oh model, the copolarized ratio p  ( ), the crosspolarized ratio q ( ), and  are functions of three surface parameters (Mv, ks, kl) and radar  incidence angle (  ), where the Oh model can be generally  expressed as  HH / VV  HV / VV  HV  4.165.0 )(4.035.090/1 ksMv ep            (2)  8.0)(9.0 2.1  13.1sin1.0 kse l s  q (3)  8.1)(32.02.27.0 1cos11.0 ksHV eMv           (4) Where k is wave number. Mv is soil moisture, and s and l are root  mean squared height and correlation length, respectively.

Two parameters (s and l ) are used by the IEM model to characterize  surface roughness. Radar backscattering coefficient as formulated  by the IEM model is function of surface roughness and incidence  angle. Thus the approach adopted here was to simulate the  backscattering coefficients using the models based on the imaging  parameters of SAR images, and to generate the dataset of  backscattering coefficient and surface parameters. Then the  backscattering coefficients are input for conducting the surface  parameters using GA.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  Field validation of derived s  To examine the performance of s estimation using different models,  SAR images were used for s estimation corresponding to field  sampling sites. Then model-derived s was compared with  field-measurements of s for 6 study sites. Fig. 1 shows the  comparison of inversion values of s based on IEM and Oh models  using L-band ALOS PALSAR and ENVISAT ASAR data, and field  measurements. Values of s inverted by the models are equivalent to  field measurements, resulted in the least error. Mean absolute errors  of inversion values from IEM model-predicted and Oh  model-predicted are 0.0341 cm and 0.381 cm, and rsm errors are  0.0486 cm and 0.0392 cm, respectively. These indicated the  inversion accuracy is equivalent using IEM and Oh models.

Fig. 1. Comparison of field measurement and inversion value  Estimation results of surface parameters  Oh model was only used for large scale estimation of surface  parameters using SAR data because inversion needs more  computing time using IEM model. The surface parameters were  estimated using PALSAR and ASAR data, respectively, due to  different coverage of two types of data. Fig. 2 shows the values of  ks and soil moisture estimated using L-band PALSAR image. For  all pixels that meet inversion demand, estimation values (ks) of 90%  are less than 0.75, and soil volume moisture of 60% is less than  10%. The roughness in the area along Heihe River is big, and it is  very small in the other areas far from Heihe River. Fig. 3 shows the  roughness and soil moisture estimated using C-band ASAR image.

The results are same with L-band PALSAR image estimated. The  estimated roughness shows the ground surface of Ejina alluvial fan  is very flat, so the range of its roughness is small, and the root mean  squared heights in most party of the alluvial fan are no more than  1.0cm.  On the other hand, the estimated soil moisture also  indicates this area is very arid, and the soil volume moisture in most  party is no more than 10%.
