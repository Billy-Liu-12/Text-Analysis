Augm-enting Data Collection and Analysis of Operational

Abstract-In this paper, we describe a toolset (Framework) and associated analytic methodology that are intended to support the development of architectural models for Network-Centric 'intelligent" air systems. The Framework has been developed, as an architecture-driven, concept, design and evaluation environment for network-centric aeronautical systems that leverages a range of Semantic Web technologies. The Framework provides a flexible distributed simulation environment that will accommodate a wide range of "pluggable" Operations Analysis (OA) simulations and design tools to support assessment of systems under consideration. We employ a general meta- model of the common domain of discourse that contains, organizes and correlates all the information that each of the "4plugged-in" applications needs to function as well as any additional information particular to the composed system.

This model becomes the basis of communications between the cooperating systems. These models are then used to configure a user-selected set of distributed simulations and data analysis tools. 12  We represent the meta-model in RDF/XML which, we believe, provides several important advantages. RDF is a knowledge representation language that allows information to be described as a set of factual sentences. When these sentences are constrained by, and are consistent with an OWL ontology, this enables the use of an existing, robust collection of automatic reasoners and other logical tools to classify, assess, query, apply rules and otherwise operate on the model itself, independently of the cooperating applications.

Also important to the analysis derived from RDF within the framework is the non-RDF compliant textual output from legacy plug-in systems. We describe the process by which an example textual simulation output is converted to RDF.

We describe the problem definition, how the template ontology was created, and how the data was extracted and combined with the template ontology to form the structured output. This "4ontologizing" process uses the JENA Semantic Web Framework package to produce a structured output ontology. We then discuss the use of SPARQL queries and SWRL rules that effectively expands the ' 1-4244-1488-1/08/$25.00 C 2008 IEEE 2 IEEEAC paper #1236, Version 2, Updated December 14, 2007  functionality of the system and greatly improves the analysis of the output of the system of cooperating simulations and tools.
