The Empirical Research on the Relationships between  Perceptions of Organizational Practices and

Abstract?This research examines the relationships between conceptions of organizational practices (POS, LMX, and perceived meaning of work) and psychological contracts (transactional, balanced, and relational) using knowledge employees as research participants. We test the hypothesized relationships using hierarchical regression analysis with data from a sample of 452 knowledge employees from several big cities of China. The results show that POS, LMX and perceived meaning of work are all positively related to balanced psychological contract and relational psychological contract respectively, and perceived meaning of work is negatively related to transactional psychological contract, and neither POS nor LMX is related to transactional psychological contract.

Keywords- POS; LMX; perceived meaning of work; transactional psychological contract; balanced psychological contract; relational psychological contract

I.  INTRODUCTION Since the notion of psychological contract between  employer and employee has gained currency as a means of understanding changes in the employment relationship [1], psychological contract has become increasingly important in helping to define the contemporary employment relationship [2]. Psychological contracts consist of the beliefs employees hold regarding the terms and conditions of the exchange agreement between themselves and their organizations [3].

Although psychological contracts were first discussed by organizational scholars in the 1960s, only recently have these unwritten work agreements attracted widespread attention.

Recent research on psychological contract has generally focused on two areas. First, a number of articles have discussed the changing nature, contents and the types of the psychological contract. Second, another line of research has investigated the antecedents and negative consequences of psychological contract breach (or violation) on employee  attitudes and behaviors. There is little attention given to the antecedents of different types of psychological contracts except some scholars? scattered works [4-6]. As to the research participants, there is no researcher to focus on knowledge employees by far. In the era of knowledge economy, knowledge employees are the most important resources of organizations. Therefore, studying issues related to knowledge employees has great practical meanings. Our paper aims to contribute to the psychological contract literature in the following area: investigating the relationships between perceptions of organizational practices and psychological contracts using knowledge employees as research participants.



II. PSYCHOLOGICAL CONTRACT THEORY Psychological contracts are an individual?s beliefs  regarding reciprocal obligations in an employment exchange relationship [7]. These beliefs are based on an individual?s perceptions that promises have been exchange and accepted by both parties. The psychological contract is found to serve as an important regulator of employer-employee relationships [7, 8].

Emerging empirical research suggests that the type of relationships that individuals perceive they have with their employer have important consequences for how the individuals contribute to those relationships [9].

Rousseau proposed two key facets that would help distinguish forms of psychological contract: time frame and performance requirements. Rousseau used these two facets to develop four types of psychological contract: transactional, relational, balanced and transitional. She operationalized the framework in Psychological Contract Inventory (PCI) [10].

Transactional contract refers to short-term or limited duration employment arrangements, primarily focuses upon economic or monetary exchange. In contrast, relational contract involves a mutually satisfying relationship with open- ended arrangements that include socioemotional as well as  Sponsored by Project of Beijing Owned Colleges and Universities?

economic terms based upon mutual trust and loyalty. The third type, balanced contract, consists of an open-ended relational emphasis with the transactional feature of well-specified performance-reward contingencies and it is sometimes referenced as a type of ?hybrid? psychological contract [11].

Balanced contract expresses employee?s identification with his/her profession [6]. As to transitional contract, Rousseau indicated it was not a psychological contract, which could be viewed as a total breakdown of an agreement between the employee and his/her organization reflecting the consequences of organizational change [10]. Accordingly, transactional, relational, and balanced contracts represent important types of psychological contract in employment situations.

Studies have confirmed the types of psychological contract assessed in the PCI in the United States, Singapore [10], Latin America [12], and China [13]. Additionally, Lee et al. [14] examined whether transactional, relational, and balanced contract types were relevant in China by formulating their own measure with the help of representatives from Hong Kong and the United States although they didn?t use the PCI. The findings of Lee et al. indicate the three forms of psychological contract in both countries and are consistent with the notion that contract types have similar meanings across the two cultures. Based on above empirical researches, our study intends to use PCI to operationalize the psychological contract.



III. SELECTION OF ORGANIZATIONAL ANTECEDENTS From the definition and formation of psychological  contracts, we can see that cognition plays a very critical role.

Lewis, Goodman and Fandt define cognition as ?the way that people experience, process, and interpret things around them [15].? Therefore, we conclude that employees? conceptions of organizational practices will influence their psychological contracts. Here we call conceptions of organizational practices as organizational variables.

As we all know that, in the era of knowledge economy, knowledge employees, as carriers of knowledge, have greater choice about which they want to work for, resulting in organizations competing for knowledge workers rather than knowledge workers competing to join a particular organization [16]. Organizations adopt some new methods to treat this key group which are different from those to treat ordinary employees in order to retain and encourage them.

Organizations strive to make knowledge employees realize how organizations care and pay attention to them from aspects of welfare, supervisor?s support, procedural justice and so on.

As we all know that knowledge employees work in a team or a group generally. They establish some kind of collaborative relationship with their team leader or supervisor and the functions of team leader or supervisor are coordinating, guiding and serving which are different from those of ordinary ones?. Besides, meaning of work itself is very important for knowledge employee which is a vital factor that knowledge employee needs to consider when deciding to leave or stay the organization.

Based upon above analysis, we can see that knowledge employees are very different from ordinary employees on aspects of perceived organizational support (POS), leader- member exchange (LMX) and perceived meaning of work.

Thus, we select these three variables as organizational-level variables which differentiate knowledge employees from ordinary ones.



IV. HYPOTHESIS The concept of POS was first presented by Eisenberger and  his colleagues in the 1980?s, which suggests that employees form global beliefs regarding the value that organization places on their well-being and contributions [17]. This conception has two key points. One is employee?s feeling about whether organization attaches importance to his contribution. The other is employee?s feeling about whether organization cares his welfare [17]. Employees use POS to express their perceived commitments which come from the organizations. Organizational supports are able to satisfy employees? socio-emotional needs.

From the above discussion, we can know that POS shows the relationship based on respect and trust between employee and organization. The higher the levels of POS are, the more positive that employees evaluate the organizations and the more positive information that employees selectively pay attention to. Thus, high-level POS make employees feel that the relationships between the organization and them are not just based on economic exchange but based on social exchange.

POS expresses the positive affections of employees to the organization and shows employees? affirmation to the cares and respects of the organization. According to reciprocity principle of social exchange theory, employees will have the sense of obligation to concern the organization?s welfare.

Their responsibilities to the organization are not limited in the scope of job prescription. They will take on more responsibilities for the development of the organization and have affective attachments to the organization. Accordingly, we give the following hypotheses:  ? Hypothesis 1a. POS is negatively related to transactional psychological contract.

? Hypothesis 1b. POS is positively related to balanced psychological contract.

? Hypothesis 1c. POS is positively related to relational psychological contract.

The leader?member exchange (LMX) theory was developed by Graen and his colleagues in 1972 and it denotes the quality of the relationship between an employee and the employee?s immediate supervisor [18]. The relationships that leaders develop with subordinates have been described on a continuum.

At one extreme are subordinates who are part of the ?in-group?.

In-group membership is characterized by a high degree of mutual trust, respect, and obligation [18]. At the other extreme are the subordinates who are part of the ?out-group?. Out-    group membership is characterized by low trust, respect, and obligation [18].

According to Levinson?s opinion, employees often treat the actions of their direct supervisor as the personification of the organization?s commitment to them [19]. High-quality LMX makes employees perceive what the organization pay for them and experience the extensive responsibilities that the organization takes on based on individual development and affection beyond written contracts. In accordance with reciprocity, responsibilities that employees feed back are not just in the prescription of written contracts. Employees will take on more extensive responsibilities based on socio-emotion for the development of the organization. Hence, the higher the quality of LMX, the more extensive responsibilities that employees perceive what they take on. Therefore, we hypothesize that:  ? Hypothesis 2a. LMX is negatively related to transactional psychological contract.

? Hypothesis 2b. LMX is positively related to balanced psychological contract.

? Hypothesis 2c. LMX is positively related to relational psychological contract.

Perceived meaning of work refers to employee?s perception to his/her work target and the value of the target according to his/her value system and standard. It is one of the most emphasized aspects by knowledge employee [20].

Liden, Wayne & Sparrowe suggest that employees will appreciate the organization and their identifications, attachments and loyalties to the organization will be increased if the organization makes employees to sense the meaning of work [21]. According to their opinion, with the increase of meaning of work, employees are willing to take on more responsibilities which exceed the scope of specification. Based on above analysis, we propose the following hypothesis:  ? Hypothesis 3a. Perceived meaning of work is negatively related to transactional psychological contract.

? Hypothesis 3b. Perceived meaning of work is positively related to balanced psychological contract.

? Hypothesis 3c. Perceived meaning of work is positively related to relational psychological contract.

The hypothesized relationships are showed in Figure 1.

V. METHOD  A. Participates In this paper, the following two factors are considered  when operationalizing knowledge employees: (1) tasks employees assigned are finished mainly in the office and (2) employees must gain bachelor or above degrees.

Data were collected through a questionnaire survey distributed to 600 employees of some high-technology companies according with above requirements from several cities of China, including Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen. In order to ensure the authenticity of responses, the questionnaire takes the form of anonymity. Out of the 600 employees surveyed, 432 employees completed the survey, a response rate of 72 percent. The sample was 39.5 percent female, 59 percent were under 30 years of age, 5 percent were over 40, 98.7 percent were graduates and above, the average total tenure was 5.8 years (SD?4.16) and the average tenure of the current job was 3.9 years (SD?3.46).

B. Measures All measures used a 5-point Likert type scale response  format (1=strongly disagree to 5=strongly agree). The reported psychological contract was measured with the revised Psychological Contract Inventory developed by Rousseau which represented the three psychological contract types of transactional and balanced, relational [10]. 24 items were included (4 items for transactional contract, 10 items for balanced contract, and 8 items for relational contract). POS was measured using the 8-item simplified measure developed by Eisenberger, Cummings, Armeli and Lynch [17]. LMX was measured using the 7-item measure developed by Scandura and Graen [22]. Perceived meaning of work which is a dimension of psychological empowerment was measured using the 3-item measure developed by Spreitzer [23].



VI. RESULTS Before testing the hypotheses, we examined the internal  consistencies of all scales and confirmed the existence of the three psychological contract types. The Cronbach Alpha obtained for transactional psychological contract, balanced psychological contract, relational psychological contract, POS, LMX and perceived meaning of work was 0.65, 0.91, 0.84, 0.88, 0.87 and 0.90 respectively. Except one was lower than 0.70 slightly, the others were higher than 0.80. All the coefficients could be accepted.

Then we conducted a confirmatory factor analysis using AMOS 16.0 to confirm the existence of the three psychological contract types. We used CMIN/DF, CFI, GFI and RMSEA as key indicators of overall model fit. Values of less than or equal to 5 on the CMIN/DF, greater than or equal to 0.90 on the GFI, CFI, less than or equal to 0.08 on the RMSEA indicate good fit [24]. The CFA yielded acceptable fit indices, CMIN/DF=2.48; CFI=0.94; GFI=0.90; RMSEA=0.057. The resulting factor structure showed a clean three-factor structure with all items loading on their predicted contract types.

POS  LMX  Perceived meaning of work  Transactional contract  Balanced contract  Relational contract    Table 1 shows the means, standard deviations, and correlations of the variables in this study.

Perceived meaning of work 3.67 0.73 -0.23** 0.40** 0.44** 0.41** 0.39** ?  *p<.05   **<.01    Hierarchical regression analysis was used to test the hypotheses. The control variables were entered in step 1 of the equation. These included gender, education level, age, total tenure, tenure of current job, and times of converting jobs. Here it was necessary to point out that two dummy variables were introduced to represent bachelor degree and master degree of education level respectively.

Hypotheses 1a, 2a and 3a were tested by regressing transactional psychological contract on the control variables, POS, LMX and perceived meaning of work. Hypotheses 1b, 2b and 3b were tested by regressing balanced psychological contract on the control variables, POS, LMX and perceived meaning of work. Hypotheses 1c, 2c and 3c were tested by regressing relational psychological contract on the control variables, POS, LMX and perceived meaning of work.

Whether hypotheses were confirmed was through observing regression coefficients of POS, LMX and perceived meaning of work separately.

As Table 2 shows, POS was positively related to balanced psychological contract (?=0.136, P?0.01), positively related to relational psychological contract (?=-0.267, P?0.01) and not related to transactional psychological contract (?=-0.078).

From Table 2, we can also see that LMX was positively related to two psychological contract dimensions ? balanced psychological contract (?=0.171, P? 0.01) and relational psychological contract (?=0.142, P?0.01) and not related to transactional psychological contract (?=-0.063). Besides, table 2 also tells us that perceived meaning of work was positively related to two psychological contract dimensions ? balanced psychological contract (?=0.255, P? 0.01) and relational psychological contract (?=0.247, P?0.01) and negatively related to transactional psychological contract (?=-0.127, P? 0.01). Therefore, hypothesis 1c, 2a, 2b, 2c, 3a, 3b, and 3c were all supported and hypothesis 1a and 1b were not confirmed.

VII. DISCUSSION This study served the following purpose: studying the  relationships between perceptions of organizational practices and psychological contracts using knowledge employees as research participants. 7 of 9 hypotheses were confirmed.

The two unconfirmed hypothesis are that POS is negatively related to transactional psychological contract and LMX is negatively related to transactional psychological contract. The results showed that they were not related either. The reasons can be explained below. As we know that, transactional psychological contracts are based upon economic or monetary exchange and the responsibilities that employees take on are specified definitely in job descriptions. That is to say, transactional responsibilities are lack of flexibility to some extent. Therefore, the manner that employees are treated seems to have little influence on transactional responsibilities that employees take on. Moreover, social desirability may weaken the relationships not only between POS and transactional psychological contract but also between LMX and transactional psychological contract when employees answer the questionnaires.

Additionally, it is worth noting that the influences of perceived meaning of work on employee?s psychological contracts were quite significant. This result indicates that perceived meaning of work is a key antecedent of knowledge employee?s psychological contract. The possible reason is that knowledge employees care self-worth achievement much more and aspire to obtain internal satisfaction from their work since the hierarchy of their needs is rather high. Therefore, they pay much attention to meaning of work and whether work is meaningful or not is a very critical factor when evaluating the relationship with the organization.

Finally, it is important to point out the study?s limitations.

The biggest problem of this study is that data were collected at a single point in time. Thus, the use of cross-sectional research design limits the ability to make firm conclusions about cause and effect among variables in the study. Future longitudinal research is needed to confirm the conclusions drawn by this study.
