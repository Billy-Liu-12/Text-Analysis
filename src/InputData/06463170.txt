Abstract-Association rules mining is a process of finding patterns from a very large volumes of data. The Apriori algorithm is the best-known association rules mining algorithm, whose objective is to find all co-occurrence relationships between data items. In this paper, a methodology that combines the Apriori algorithm with a domain-specific ontology is proposed. This method is to effectively utilize domain ontologies to find multiple layer association rules.



I. INTRODUCTION  ONE important topic in data mining research is concernedwith the discovery ofinteresting association rules[ 1]-[4].

Association rules in complex data objects, such as tuples  or documents, occur when one set of attributes is likely to co-occur with another set[5]. Currently, association rules have demonstrated their value in discovering interesting correlations between sets of attributes in databases[6].

An association rule is an implication of the form X~Y, where X and Yare sets of attributes. Association rules can be rated by a number of quality measures, among which support and confidence stand out as the two essential ones[7]. The basic problem of mining association rules is then to generate all association rules X~Y that have support and confidence greater than user-specified thresholds. The best-known association rules mining algorithm is introduced by Agrawal et a1 named as Apriori for databases consisting of only categorical attributes.

The problems in using Apriori method is that the size of each transaction increases which leads to a rising in their scan time[8]. Also in frequent itemsets generation step, the number of candidate itemsets is several times more than when all the exiting attributes are binary form. It finally causes the definite time to compute the frequency of the candidate itemsets be more.

To overcome these problems, a new Apriori association rule method is proposed by using ontology[9]-[11]. Ontology represents knowledge with the relationships between concepts. With the domain knowledge, the search space and counting time can be reduced, so knowledge discovery can be improved effectively and more interesting and meaning     Fig. 1.

Waterway transport, for example, contains: water transportation infrastructure (ports, waterways); delivery vehicles (all types ofvessels ); goods (coal, ores, crude oil, container cargo, etc.); organizations and personnel involved (shipping companies, maritime agencies, shipping agents, cargo agents and crew, etc.). Make the "ship" and "ship" subclass as an example, the ontology structure shown in Figure 2.

common mining models.

B. Domain Ontology Example Domain knowledge can be described by ontology. Domain  concepts are organized in a directed acyclic graph; Figure 1.The associations among concepts are described and defined using ontology axioms.

Ontology Concept Nowadays, one of the most important problems in Data  Mining is the definition of the prior knowledge; this can be originated from the process or the domain[12]. This contextual information may help to select the appropriate information, decrease the space of hypothesis, represent the output in a most comprehensible way and improve the process.

Ontological foundation is a precondition for efficient automated usage of such information. Ontology provide the formal framework for expressing knowledge about a domain and comprising semantic links among domain[ 13]. The main purpose of ontology is to specify domain concepts, define vocabularies and their relationships combining with ontology axioms, in order to support knowledge sharing and reusing.

Ontology is a formal, explicit specification of a shared conceptualization[14]-[16]. ontology can be defined as five-tuple O(C,R,H,P,A), where C is the set of concepts; R represents all non-hierarchical relationships; H represents the hierarchical relationships of ontology, that records the information ofhierarchical, H (Ci,Cj) means that concept Ci is a descendant of Cj; P represents attributes of concepts and A is the set of ontology axioms.

We adopt the ontology technique into the following four groups:  1) schema ontology: describes the schema structure and relationship between the attributes of the data warehouse'  2) schema constraint ontology: describes the constr~ints between attributes;  3) domain ontology: collects the related domain and expert knowledge;  4) user preference ontology: integrates the derived

OWL (Web Ontology Language) by the Web Ontology Working Group of World Wide Web, a revised version of DAML + OIL. Compared with XML, RDF and RDF Schema, OWL is better to be able to express semantics.

This article make General Cargo Ship as an example, explains how to document the ontology, the ontology representation as follows:  <owl:Class rdf:ID="Ship"> <rdfs: subClassOf>  <owl:Class rdf:ID="Shipping"l> </rdfs:subClassOf>  </owl:Class> <owl:Class rdf:ID="DryCargoShip">  <rdfs: subClassOf> <owl:Class rdf:ID=" Ship"l>  </rdfs:subClassOf> </owl:Class> <owl:Class rdf:ID=" GeneralCargoShip "> <rdfs:subClassOf> <owl:Class rdf:ID=" DryCargoShip "> </rdfs:subClassOf> <owl:disjointWith>  <owl:Class rdfID=" BulkCargoShip"l> </owl:disjointWith> <owl:disjointWith>  <owl:Class rdf:ID=" RefrigeratedShip "I> </owl:disjointWith> <owl:disjointWith>  <owl:Class rdf:ID=" TimberShip "I> </owl:disjointWith> <owl:disjointWith>  <owl:Class rdf:ID=" ContainerShip "I> </owl:disjointWith> <owl:disjointWith>  <owl:Class rdf:ID=" RollonRolloffShip "I> </owl:disjointWith> <owl:disjointWith>  <owl:Class rdf:ID=" BargeCarrier "> </owl:disjointWith>  C. The evaluation OfOntology , Value in Data Mining With the support ofthese ontologies, the original algorithm  can be added the following advantages: 1) Avoids the generation of useless patterns, thus the  findings of useful patterns can be achieved successfully.

2) Finds concept extended rules from the existing primitive  data warehouse with the help of the proposed domain ontology.

3) Allows the mining constraints to be set more precisely by including relationship information defined in the domain ontology.

4) Let the association rules to show the hierarchical and multiple layers patterns. Use the concept relation between different ontology layer, the higher and lower concept in the   domain ontology can support the mmmg of hierarchical association rules.



IV. ASSOCIATION RULES BASED ON DOMAIN ONTOLOGY  A. Algorithm Description We can construct ontology which integrates the domain  knowledge and prior knowledge, combines with expert knowledge and user awareness from dataset. Association rule mining can be done under the guidance of ontology; the multi-level association rules extracted from ontology meet the actual situation and also can express user's purpose.

Multi-level association rules contain these rules that are extracted from same concept level or different concept levels.

Generally, the knowledge represented by low-level association rules are less general, often have to be generalized to higher level. On the other hand, cross-level association rules contain higher actual value.

Our algorithm is based on ontology, which has used domain knowledge to guide the discovery process such that we can discover interesting rules.

Input the domain ontology contains a classification of the relationship, and relationship to each concept, as well as semantic relations between them.

Input datasets with the transaction of database. Firstly, we use the concept of a higher level in the ontology to make the property classification of each type of dataset, and find concepts relating to these concepts in the semantic relationship between the ontology, which is considered as a meta rules.

These meta rules determine the semantic relationships between classes. The second phase of the algorithm involved to identify frequent itemsets in the dataset. To this end, the frequency 0 f the candidate itemsets in the dataset should be calculated. In the previous algorithm, all candidate itemsets frequency has been calculated, that is to scan the relationship between all of the items discussed in the dataset, there are a lot of calculation, take a long time to carry out the algorithm.

To resolve this issue, we only study the relationship between the related projects related to the project concept or concepts in the ontology of semantic relations. A large number of candidate itemsets includes projects related to different concepts, there is no semantic relation in the ontology, so we omit these candidate itemsets. Do not need to spend time in the set number of counts. If these projects set at random exist in a number of transactions, they will not be a good decision-making source.

The third phase of the algorithm is to get the frequent itemsets in the association rules. At this stage, the rules inherit the semantic relation is known as meta-rules. Therefore, the rules are easier to be understood with the semantics relations.

B. Algorithm Process The following shows the details of the algorithm.

Input 1) A set ofN transaction with n attributes; 2) The minimum support; 3) The minimum confidence;    4) A domain Ontology.

Step I: Pre-process and Produce Meta rules based on ontology:  1. Classification attributes in the database reflect the existing concepts in domain ontology  2. Have the right classes according to the class concept.

3. Produce Meta rules according to the semantic  relationship between the ontology concept  Step 2: Generate frequent itemsets 1. Find the frequent 1-itemsets L1 2. Find the frequent 2-itemsets L2 1) Produce the candidate 2-itemsets C2 from L1 in case that  items of every itemsets belong to a concept or the concepts possessing semantic relations in the ontology.

2) Compute the support number for each itemset in 2-itemsets by Equation 1.

3) Delete the 2-itemsets of which support is less than the minimum support.

4)Insert the remaining 2-itemsets into the frequent itemsets L 2 .

3 .Find the frequent k-itemsets t, 1) Produce the candidate k itemsets Ck from Lk-1 2) Find new itemsets based on ontology: Delete any  candidate in Ck that consists of an item and its ancestor; Delete any ancestors in Ck that are not present candidates in c,  3) Compute the support degree for each itemset in k-itemsets by Equation 1.

4) Delete the k-itemsets of which support is less than the minimum support.

5) Insert the remaining k itemsets into the frequent itemsets Lk.

Step 3: Make Apriori association rules 1). Compute the confidence degree for each rule by  Equation 2.

2). Remove the rules with the confidence degree less than  the minimum confidence.

3). Output the remaining association rules with their  support and confidence degrees and Meta rules related to each of them.

C. New Algorithm Evaluation Ontology provides the description of the concept of  hierarchy layer, and to describe the relationship between the concepts of generalization and its advantages are:  1) a higher level object association patterns mnung, resulting in a generally clear, revealing a more general concept;  2) the number ofrules extracted at a high level much is less than the low-level data mining, will produce fewer rules and easier to handle and understand;  3) multi-level association rules can be a more valuable multi-level data mining method. Ontology-based association rule mining algorithms will become an effective tool for a multi-level association rule mining. But at the same time, the   introduction of the parent class in frequent itemset calculation make the need to calculate the project have increased, the performance of the algorithm will have an impact, so future research should focus on considering the optimization algorithm design.



V. CONCLUSION The association rule mining is an active research area of  data mining. It is proposed and developed a new association rule method to improve the efficiency of the classic association rule mining problem, providing the ability to deal with the relationship between the domain ontology. The combination of the concept of the ontology with the standard rules mining algorithm is an efficiency and effective data mining approach.
