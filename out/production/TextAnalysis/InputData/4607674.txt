Intelligent Concept-Oriented and Content-Based Image Retrieval by Using Data  Mining and Query Decomposition Techniques

ABSTRACT   Traditional image retrieval based on visual-based matching is not effective in multimedia applications. Consequently, the modeling of high-level human sense for image retrieval has been a challenging issue over the past few years. In fact, the concepts hidden in the images play key roles in semantic image retrieval. In this paper, we propose a novel method named Intelligent Concept-Oriented Search (ICOS) that can capture the high-level concepts in images by utilizing data mining and query decomposition techniques. The contributions of the proposed method lie in that we provide: 1) effective annotation for conceptual objects, 2) association mining for conceptual objects, 3) visual ranking for conceptual objects and 4) intelligent search method for enhancing high-level concept image retrieval. Through experimental evaluations, ICOS is shown to be very effective and efficient in capturing the implicit high-level concepts for image retrieval.

INTRODUCTION  Most of contemporary CBIR (Content-Based Image Retrieval) systems explored to look for the primary features to present an image. However, the related efforts are not satisfactory enough due to the gap between low-level features and high-level concepts. Instinctively, the natural way to bridge the high-level concepts and low-level features is to conceptualize the images by image understanding techniques. Thus, image classification [8] and annotation [9] have been the substantial solutions on semantic image over the past few years. Carson et al. [3][4] proposed efficient ways for representing a decision tree in capturing the images. In their approach, the images are divided into several objects, called blobs, and each blob contains two features, namely color and texture. By making use of the visual features, the distance between two blobs is computed in constructing the decision tree. Aghbari et al. [1] exploited hill-climbing and SVM (Support Vector Machine) to  segment an image into several objects and performed the image classification by four features extracted from these objects.

Nevertheless, there still exist some problems in traditional classification-based image retrieval. For example, different users making different query-terms perhaps want to look for the same kind of images. Namely, it is very difficult to make precise responses to the diverse high-level queries from different kinds of users. In addition to above, another popular way for image retrieval is data mining, which is shown to be very useful in multimedia applications recently. The major point of data mining previous work ignored is that association rules could provide image retrieval with the high-level semantic and high-quality index.

Djeraba [5] proposed an approach by using association mining [2] for content-based image retrieval. In this approach, it generates an efficient visual dictionary that summarizes the features in database. Each feature of visual dictionary associated with a symbolic representation help users find the images effectively. However, it fails in presenting high-level concepts embedded in the image exactly by the discovered visual association rules, e.g., Texture1 Color3.

To deal with the problems above, we propose a new  method, namely Intelligent Concept-Oriented Search (ICOS), to achieve high-level image retrieval. As shown in Figure 1, the key notion of ICOS is that we make use of Image-Concept Query Decomposition (ICQD) technique to decompose a query image into several concepts to touch the user?s mind nearly. Moreover, these implied association concepts/rules can provide image retrieval with a very good       index to hunt the desired images efficiently without repeating the low-level feature comparisons. The remaining of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we describe the proposed system ICOS. A brief experimental evaluation is illustrated with section 3. Finally, the conclusion is stated in section 4.

2. PROPOSED METHOD   As depicted in Figure 2, ICOS we propose provides users with concept-oriented search to get the desired high-level images. The major tasks of this system can be divided into two following phases.

Fig. 2. The framework of ICOS.

A. Training Phase This phase mainly concerns the generation of association rules formed by the objects segmented from the training images. Before the generation of association rules, the classification model has to be constructed first. Through the constructed classification model, we can annotate the compound images in the multimedia database to reduce the gap between high-level concepts and low-level features.

Then the association concepts/rules among the images can be discovered. According to the derived association concepts, the higher retrieval quality can be reached.

Additionally, the vertical image-transactions we propose can also speed up image retrieval in the retrieval phase.

B. Concept Retrieval Phase After generating association rules, another main task is to look for the images matching the concept queries from the users. The entire procedure starts with that a query image is submitted to the search engine, it is first segmented into several objects automatically. Then the Classification Engine and the useful association rules will be integrated to capture the appropriate concepts on display. Upon the user?s feedbacks, high-level images can be retrieved further.

2.1. Segmentation Mediator Segmentation Mediator is responsible for image segmentation and feature extraction automatically. Next, it delivers these segmented objects to Classification Engine. In this component, we adopt the popular public software Normalized Cut [7] to perform the image segmentation and XMTool to execute the feature extraction. Figure 3 shows that original (A) is segmented into 5 regions as (B) by  Normalized Cut, and these 5 regions finally are extracted in each referred minimum boundary box as shown in (C).

2.2. Classification Engine The primary goal of Classification Engine is to identify the objects extracted from the un-annotated images. To reach this goal, a classification model has to be constructed by the training images. Among the well-known classification approaches, Decision Tree, SVM and KNN are candidate methods we considered ever. As a result of the experimental evaluations, SVM is selected to be as the classifier to identify the unknown objects in this work. Figure 4 shows that an unknown object can be classified by the highest       probability of the specific category of the concept ontology.

As depicted in Figure 5, the ontology can be considered as a tree composing of some linguistic nodes. By the hierarchical navigation of the concept ontology, the high-level topics can be derived. For feasibility, this idea is motivated by human knowledge learning and this paper is just the start of the image concept retrieval system. That is, once the knowledge base is complete in the future, semantic image retrieval will be more perfect.

2.3. Data Mining Engine The association rule mining for image concepts is motivated by discovering the objects frequently occurring in a list of image transactions, called horizontal image transaction table.

An image can be considered as a transaction and a transaction contains several objects viewed as items. To improve the performance, the horizontal image transaction table must be converted into the vertical image transaction table. Hence, CBW approach [6] is adopted to mine the rules since CBW is an efficient algorithm for vertical association mining. Finally, the discovered concept-object rules, such as ?Elephant Grass?, can provide image search with the useful semantic-index support.

Input: Query image QI, a concept-ontology R and probability  threshold h; Output: Desired images DI; // Classification of unknown objects 1) Let O={ob| ob  Segment(QI)}; 2) for each ob  O do 3)   if probability(ob) h then 4)     Replace ob with Concept object CO; 5) end // Presentation of linguistic terms 6) Find CO  R; 7) Find the frequent itemset Topic  R where Topic = CO; 8) Select top 5 CO and rank the top 5 CO by their proportions  and positions; 9) Select top 5 Topics and rank the top 5 Topics by their  confidences; // Representation of desired images 10) for each CO picked up by the user do 11) Exploit vertical transaction list; 12) Capture matching images DIco; 13) end 14) for each Topic picked up by the user do 15) Perform the intersection of CO  Topic on vertical  transaction list; 16) Capture matching images DItopic; 17) end 18) return DI = DIco DItopic;  Fig. 6. Algorithm for concept retrieval.

2.4. Search Engine All Search Engine has to do is to look for the desired images efficiently and effectively by association rules. As shown in Figure 6, the whole procedure starts with that once  the system receives a query image, Search Engine first forwards the query image to Segmentation Mediator, and waits for the relevant concept terms derived by Classification Engine to seek for the matching association rules. In our approach, these implied concept terms are sorted by their proportions and positions. Out of human vision, the more central and massive the object is, the more important it is. That is to say, the most central and massive objects must be listed on the front of the sifted results on display because they are quite near human focus. Besides, the topic terms are listed below the individual terms. Finally, the system displays the candidate concept options including individual terms and topic terms. If the most preferred option is picked up by the user, Search Engine will perform the concept intersections to hunt the matching images.

3. EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATIONS  We have presented the proposed ICOS in the preceding section. Now we will describe the performance evaluations of the proposed approach by using real image data. The image data in our experiments were collected from Corel Gallery Professional Image Library and the web search engine on the Internet. We chose thirty categories and each category contains 100 images to be our experimental data.

Seventy percent of the gathered images were taken as the training set and the others were for testing. Three measures for evaluating our proposed system are precision and F- measure.

t   Fig. 8. F-measures for different thresholds.

In our experiments, the evaluations were conducted in three major perspectives: 1) the precisions for identifying objects by three kinds of classification models namely SVM, C4.5 and KNN; 2) the F-measures for image-concept query decomposition under different classification thresholds; 3)       the performances for different sizes of experimental data.

Figure 7 shows that SVM outperforms the other classification models in terms of precision. On average, the precisions for SVM, C4.5 and KNN are 87.6%, 56.9% and 54.7%. From another viewpoint, in dealing with high variations of images, KNN and C4.5 cannot bring out the stable performance. This indicates that the SVM can identify the unknown objects more effectively than the others with higher consistency among different categories.

That is why we selected SVM to be our object identifier in this system. Figure 8 depicts that the best point of fall for threshold setting is 0.4. This delivers that the smaller threshold generates too many redundant concept options to increase the effort of this system. The last evaluation we desired to understand is how well the ICOS benefits the performance of image search. Figure 9 reveals that our proposed method performs better than the na?ve method significantly in terms of execution time. In other words, without vertical transaction list for image index, we cannot get such good performance. Note that the na?ve method in this experiment is the traditional image retrieval using sequential comparison strategy. Figure 10 illustrates that the system can precisely display the candidate options for the possible concepts embedded in a query image. If the user picks up the preferred concept or topic, the system will further demonstrate the images matched the user?s intention.

4. CONCLUSIONS  In this paper, we have proposed a new system named ICOS for content-based image retrieval by integrating data mining and image-concept query decomposition techniques. In summary, the proposed approach includes the following characteristics: 1) effective annotation for conceptual objects, 2) association mining for conceptual objects, 3) visual ranking for conceptual objects and 4) intelligent search method for enhancing high-level concept image retrieval. Based on the merits of the proposed approach in utilizing both of image contents and concepts, we will further improve the precision of classification and apply the scenario to various types of multimedia data in the future.
