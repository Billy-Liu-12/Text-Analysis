I. INTRODUCTION cheduling of generators with constraints such as emission S and loss for a given demand has become an important task  in the present day power generation. The& power plants while generating power, simultaneously release toxic gases such as SO2 and NO2 from boiler by burning the coal as fuel.

Also particulate matter pollutes the whole atmosphere when it exceeds the limit, The various health organizations throughout the world have reported in their findings that the levels of suspended particulate matter (SPM). and nitrogen oxides are found to be higher than the prescribed limit for the past ten years in cities. A number of filtering devices are in practice. which requires frequent maintenance and replacement and high initial investment. Clean coal must be used to reduce the level to a certain extent. One way of reducing the emission is by allocating proper generation to generators, which in turn reduces the fuel, leads to emission control.

A co-ordination between cost, emission and loss becomes necessary and the system as a whole is considered for cost minimum, controlled emission and less loss condition.

Incremental production cost of the plant and incremental transmission losses are also required.

Penalty factor approach simplifies the solution techniques to some extent. One simple approach is to make use of diagonal elements (self coefficients) so that solution techniques are very much simplified. This assumption sacrifices solution accuracy+ The mutual tem are not small for a larger system and hence cannot be ignored.

dispatch problem considering emission and loss has been reported in many papers using load flow techniques, optimization techniques, genetic algorithms and neural networks. Gent [4] discussed minimum emission dispatch by incremental loading technique. A. A. Keib IS]  employed gradient projection method for ECED problem. Delson 161 used constant penalty factor method to .solve the economic dispatch problem. Palanictiamy I91 has suggested some computational algorithms for controlled' emission dispatch.

L.D.Arya (121 suggested a new methodology for this ECED problem involving sensitivity coefficients and load flow techniques. This paper focuses a simple mathematical approach and avoids the iterative technique.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  x lo-"  The combined economic emission dispatch problem has been solved using the proposed for various price factors such as &ximum price factor, minimum price factor, average price. .:factor and common price factor. Price factors. are calculated from cost and emission equations using suitable constraints..

The various price factors are given by    _ .

INDIAN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, KHARAGPUR 721302, DECEMBER 20-22.2004 81  The loss equation is developed by using self-coefficients alone and coordinated with cost and emission equations. Full B matrix cannot be included at the initial stage as it produces an equation with multiple unit generations and solving the equation is very difficult. The equations are solved with negligible approximations by neglecting higher order teims on bath sides because their values are very low.

The coefticienk A, B, C, D and E are calculated for every price factor. Four sets of A, B, C, D and E are obtained and the scheduling of the units is obtained. For different load conditions with various price factors, the cost, emission and loss are calculated using the developed equation and the results have been furnished in tables IV, V, VI and VII.

Fig. 3 Lass for various price factors  For every price factor a fresh sei of scheduling coefficients must be calculated. It is noticed that maximum and minimum price factors are not providing better results because of poor performance combinations. Common price factor provides optimisticGvalues for both load conditions. This reveals that a common price can be used for all load conditions. So that an attempt of scheduling the generators using other price factors can be avoided.

v. CONCLUSiUN For scheduling of unit generations a composite equation  has been developed in terms of cost, emission and loss coefficients. The conventional iterative techniques have been totally avoided. The proposed method is very fast and the computation time is negligible. It can be applied to large systems and will be useful for power generation scheduling planners who are working in power stations. The composite scheduling equation allows the user to analyze the system for various conditions .,such as without emission and ioss included, loss neglected and emission included and loss, emission are neglected. Depending upon the situation suitable coefficients (appendix) can be included and the composite equation can be easily formed.
