I.  INTRODUCTION Forest resource data management is the basis of forestry  information. In realistic forestry management, data have many characteristics such as complicated operation logic, strong relevance and capriciousness, etc. So far, database system can realize data input, searching, statistics, etc. However it cannot discover the relation and rules among data nor predict the future development trends according to the existing data, which result in the phenomenon of ?data explosion but low rate of data utilizations?.

This paper provides a scientific basis for operation decisions of forest management and development strategies, according to the potential, implicit and valuable information that is abstracted from current and historical data in forest resources using data mining technology.



II. THE CONCEPT OF DATA MINING AND THE APPLICATION IN DATA ANALYSIS OF FOREST INVENTORY  Data mining is a set of statistical techniques for discovering previously undetected or unknown information and acknowledge from a large quantity of incomplete, noisy, fuzzy and random data. It can make automatic analysis and inductive reasoning and association inference to the data, and discover the internal connections among data. Because it can excavate the patterns which play important roles in information forecasting and decision behavior, data mining is a significant tool in helping decision-maker to make market stratagems and decisions.

Data mining technology can be applied for discovering the associated relation among data elements of forest inventory and finding out the attributes of some indexes in resource management. It also can be used to predict the future forest growth and alien change  tendency according to the time series of the existing data. Data mining system based on forest resource information can well reflect the interactions of forest factors and comprehensive influences, and can thus come to conclusions in accordance with the forest growth law as much as possible. Analyzing these conclusions according to the existing operation rules, people can find out favorable decision bases for forestry practice.



III. THE THEORY OF ASSOCIATION RULES ANALYSES Association rules analysis serves to discover certain correlations  or correlative connections among a large number of data items. Cross analyses, single factor and multi-factor comprehensive analyses are often needed, for there are complex relations among forest resource data, when analyzing those data items. Using association rules mining techniques to analyze forest resource data may be useful to full excavating implicit information therein.

A. The definition and applicability of association rules  Suppose that I = {I1, I2,?, Im} is a set that consist of m different items. A database of transactions D is a set of transaction T where T is a set of items, namely T? I. The number of the transactions is denoted by |D|. Each transaction has a unique mark, denoted by TID. An association rule is an implication of the form X ?Y,Y?I, and X ? Y=?. [2]The basic algorithms of association rules include Apriori, partition-based method, Hash-based method, FP-tree and so on. The calculation complexity of these algorithms and redundancy among the rules, especially the generated redundant rules, show exponential growth when there are more items, and thus can't ensure the validity of the rules.

Forest resources management surveys, whose purpose is to meet the demands of forest management schemes, general designs, forestry division and planning design, regards the state forestry bureau(field), nature reserve, forest parks and other forest management units or administrative regions of County-Level Government as the investigation unit. The obtained second class data hold abundant types including tree species, site condition, forestland usage, topography and geomorphology data, vegetation distribution and some other attributes. Using non-Redundant Association Rules Algorithm to analyze the association relation, it can calculate some nature factors or human management measures, which have close relevance with the growth of specific tree species, and can eliminate a large number of redundant data. In this case, more accurate measures on improving cultivation or tending can be put forward.

DOI 10.1109/CSSE.2008.947     B. The definition of non-Redundant Association Rules Algorithm  Definition1 As for rules A ? B and C ? D, if the support(s) and the confidence of C?D are both greater than or equal to which of A?B, then rule C?D is the redundant rule of  rule A?B.

Definition2 Rule A is considered obligatory if and only if in relative to any other rules it is neither simple redundancy nor strict redundancy.

Definition3 X is a frequent item set, and a set that consists of all the minimal subsets of X is called set of minimal subsets, denoted by F(X, c).

Theorem1 X is a frequent item set. X1, X2?, Xk are supersets of set X and Xi?L(l?i?k),Y?F(X,c)-Uki=1(Xi,c), then rule Y?X-Y is not strict redundancy in relative to any other rules.

Definition4 X,Y are frequent item sets, if sup(Y)?sup(X) ?c and there is no frequent item set Z which makes Z ? Y and sup(Z)?sup(X)?c, then Y is a minimal subset of X.

Theorem2 X is a frequent item set. X1, X2?, Xm are subsets of X and Xi?L(l?i?m). If sup(X)/c?=max_sup ( the maximum support of the frequent item sets as well as the maximum support of all the frequent item sets ), then as for ? Xi the formula F(Xi,c) ? F(X,c) holds; if sup(X)/c<max_sup, then as for all Xi which satisfy sup(X)=sup(Xi ) the formula F(Xi,c) ? F(X,c) holds.

C. The Non-redundant Association Rules Algorithm The common non-Redundant Association Rules  Algorithm includes ADRR Algorithm, MVNR Algorithm, Algorithm of non-Redundant Fast Mining Association Rules, GNRR Algorithm, etc. MVNR (Mining Valid and non-Redundant Association Rules Algorithm) is a new algorithm. It can excavate not only non-redundant, effective association rules but also association rules with negative items. When using this algorithm to excavate association rules among forest resource data, we should first screen for frequent item sets of all the data and eliminate the frequent items that only generate redundant rules, an action which greatly improves the efficiency of generating association rules.



IV. APPLICATION  OF MVNR ALGORITHM ON DATA ANALYSES OF FOREST INVENTORY  A. Data collection The survey data selected as the study object are from  small classes Forest Inventory in Fujian Province in 2007.They involved nearly 100 kinds of attribute (e.g. the growth status, growth environment, cultivate measures).

We selected six attributes: the species, origin, age, chest circumference, height and canopy density of trees. There are six items random data in Table.1:  TABLE I.  THE SURVEY DATA OF FUJIAN PROVINCE IN 2007  Tree Species Origin Chest Circumference Age Canopy Dens  ity Height  111 Self-sown 22 24 0.9 152  230 artificial seeding 15 23 0.8 11  111 Self-sown 18 24 0.6 112  304 artificial seeding 2 5 0.8 3  230 artificial seeding 25 23 0.5 18  111 Self-sown 9 14 0.5 57    B. Data pre-processing During Forest management, owing to regionally  diversity, multi-level workers, and improved technical standards, there are sometimes some errors, unusual and repugnant values among recorded data. So, original data integrity and consistency checking, noise data processing, and properly filling in lost data must be done.

Specific measures: Removal of redundant information (e.g. blank data rows, repeated rows) in the data .Process continuity data in a discrete way. For example: origin is divided into [Artificial seeding], [self-sown];age, chest circumference, height are divided respectively per 10 unit interval; canopy density is divided per 0.2 unit interval.

As a typical attribute, tree species do not need grouping.

Then all groups are marked by unique identifiers, for example: mark tree species with A1, A2?An; [Artificial seeding], [self-sown] in origin column are marked by B1? B2 respectively. The results concluded in this method are filled in Table 2.

If height is between(0,10) (F1), chest circumference is between(10,20] (C2), then the possibility of Artificial seeding forest (B1) is 100 %; For self- sown forest(B2) whose chest circumference is between (20,30] (c3) and canopy density is between[0.8,0.9] (E3),the possibility of  height being  between (10,20] (F2) is 100 %.It is obvious that in the same situation for chest circumference, the growth status of self-sown is better. So, the protection on self-sown forest must be of primary importance.

? There are 86.9 percent artificial seeding forest (B1) if age between (21, 30] (D3).Because the data analyzed are close to 2007,the seeding time reckoned is 1980s,when the country and district began to grow Artificial seeding forest a lot. The analytical results accord with reality.

? If adopt confidence>80%,then the forest whose chest circumference is between (10,20] (C2) or (20,30] (C3), and canopy density is between [0.6,0.7] (E2) or [0.8,0.9] (E3),height is between (10,20] (F2) among the forest in this region, the diversification of chest circumference and canopy density is much more than the diversification of height.

? Among forest in this region, there are 17% that are self-sown forest whose height is between (10, 20] (F2), chest circumference is between (20, 30] (C3), canopy density is between [0.8, 0.9] (E3). It shows there are quite members of self-sown forest that have become mature and grown well

V. CONCLUSION This paper demonstrates the feasibility of MVNR  Algorithm that applies in forest inventory by experiment.

The mutative tendency of future can be predicted by implied  data relationship.

The method above provides new theoretical basis and     scientific processing for management of forest resources and business activity. Thus realizing the development of forest inventory by leaps and bounds and upgrading the level of traditional forest resource management rapidly.
