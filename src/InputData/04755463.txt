ARE THERE CONTAGION EFFECTS IN THE DIFFUSION OF IT OUTSOURCING?

Abstract. Growth in the IT outsourcing industry during the past ten years has been exceptional. In this study, we theor- ize about and analyze the growth patterns of IT outsourcing at the level of the industry and at the firm level. We analyze a data set of firms using a lognormal model as a means to gauge the presence of over-dispersed diffusion and conta- gion effects that seem to drive outsourcing. A critical aspect of our research methodology is to study instances of out- sourcing events ? especially mega-deals ? that are likely to have affected decision-making by other firms in an indus- try. Our results suggest that during the periods where a rapid increase in the number of announcements following mega-deal announcements occurred, there is a hierarchical contagion effect. The diffusion of IT outsourcing is not distributed lognormally, which suggests the presence of other underlying dynamics. Our analysis shows the pres- ence of other underlying drivers that do not permit the dif- fusion pattern to be lognormal. The diffusion pattern for smaller firms appears to depend on the extent of outsourc- ing diffusion among the larger firms.

________________________________________________ 1. INTRODUCTION  Outsourcing has been around for a long time in different sectors of industry, but what is surprising about IT services outsourcing is how fast it has grown and how widely it has spread. Now any firm in any country with the requisite infrastructure and the right personnel can be a supplier of IT services. As a result, onshore and offshore IT outsourcing in the last decade has shown exceptional growth. The authorita- tive industry statistics firm, IDC, has reported that the business process outsourcing (BPO) market is ex- pected to reach US$ 641 billion by 2009, with a cu- mulative annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.9% from 2005 on [29]. The Gartner Group [8] predicts that worldwide spending on IT outsourcing will rise from US$408 billion in 2007 to US$441 billion in 2008, an increase of 8.1%.  Gartner also expects worldwide end-user spending on IT services to grow by 7.3% annually through 2011 to reach US$958 billion.

As researchers interested in the development of new theoretical perspectives that explain a variety of business phenomena, we wish to establish the extent to which the spread of IT outsourcing is analogous to the spread of a contagious disease. Contagion effects are present in the spread of diseases, which have pre- cipitating events that prompt diffusion across a popu- lation. They also constitute an economic phenomenon  [9] that may occur at random, independent of each other and across locations.

Our premise in this research is that there is more structure and a theoretical basis in the rationale that underlies the observed empirical regularities of IT outsourcing?s diffusion.  So our exploration involves looking for evidence that runs counter to the most basic intuition that IT outsourcing follows a linear growth curve. This is much the same as we might expect for the diffusion of a disease, where predis- posing situational factors, characteristics of the popu- lation, or aspects of a specific disease might lead to the spread of an epidemic in a manner that is not al- together random. We leverage this analogy and seek to refine our understanding of how the diffusion of IT outsourcing occurred at the firm and industry levels.

For over a decade academicians have been con- ducting research on outsourcing. Even though nu- merous studies have been conducted, most have fo- cused on a particular aspect of outsourcing, for in- stance, the risks involved [2], the best practices [16], the reasons for outsourcing [18], and why firms have tended to form focal outsourcing relationships with their suppliers [15]. To our knowledge none of the studies looked at the empirical regularities of the dif- fusion of outsourcing as a whole, nor have there been attempts to explain the observed patterns.

We will focus on several research questions: How can the development of new theory help to shed light on the diffusion patterns of IT outsourcing? What should be the conceptual bases for such theory? What role have IT outsourcing mega-deals, contracts with amounts greater than US$1 billion, played in the ob- served empirical patterns of diffusion?

In addition to studying the diffusion of IT out- sourcing from a contagion theory perspective, we also evaluate a new empirical methodology which has been applied in medical epidemiology, political science and economics, but not yet in the information systems (IS) discipline. Our model involves the log- normal distribution, which is appropriate when the data are overdispersed (i.e., not occurring at regular intervals in time or across space), and the underlying change or growth is multiplicative rather than addi- tive and separable.  Such models are intended to cap- ture proportionate effects in diffusion [1].  So a given amount of diffusion, based on whatever drivers that explain it, is likely to produce a correlated amount of        growth in diffusion in a subsequent period.

The paper is laid out as follows. ?2 gives back-  ground and theory that explain the diffusion process for outsourcing.  It also discusses growth models that have been used in prior studies, and offers primary statement of our theory. In ?3 we present the hypo- theses and in ?4 we introduce our two data sets. Then in ?5 we discuss the empirical regularities for IT out- sourcing that we have observed and introduce the methodology that we apply to test our proposed theory. In ?6, we provide the results of our analysis and extends our basic model to address the unex- plained variance in the estimation of our base model, and presents the results. In ?7 we discuss the results and broader theoretical implications. ?8 concludes.

2. THEORY  A number of theoretical perspectives support our proposal for contagion-theoretic view of the diffusion of IT outsourcing. We consider diffusion of innova- tion theory and contagion effects theory. They offer an explanatory perspective on the diffusion of IT outsourcing at an industry and firm level.

2.1. Outsourcing  IT outsourcing is the ?significant contributions by external vendors [to] the physical and/or human re- sources associated with the entire or specific compo- nents of the IT infrastructure in the user organiza- tion? [19]. Business process outsourcing often in- volves IT outsourcing, and is the contracting of a specific business process or service to a third-party contractor [10]. Generally, BPO includes the soft- ware, the process management, and the people to operate the service that is outsourced. We consider IT and IT-based BPO, since it accounts for a large share of overall outsourcing activities related to IT.

The growth of IT outsourcing has been exponen- tial in the last two decades. One of the main reasons for the exponential growth of both onshore and off- shore outsourcing is the technological advances that have occurred, dramatically affecting the way busi- ness is conducted. Cairncross [5] reminds us that this death of distance has led to developments in the field of IT outsourcing that are pervasive as compared to outsourcing in other fields such as manufacturing.

For twenty years, IT outsourcing has spread across different industries and moved from routine back office work to strategic business processes.

2.2. Diffusion  Diffusion is the process by which information about a focal technological innovation is communi- cated through certain channels over time among members of a social system, leading to the technolo- gy?s adoption [25]. Technology diffusion generally  follows an s-shaped curve, with five phases. Each is a proportion of the total number of adopters up to some time: innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards. To understand diffusion, one must understand the concept of network externalities.

This is the change in utility a subscriber derives from a communication service as others join [26]. With interdependent demand, multiple equilibria can co- exist at any price. The observed equilibrium depends on the static model, on the disequilibrium conditions, and on the disequilibrium adjustment process.

A key characteristic of the related diffusion of in- novations theory is its emphasis on communication channels. Social systems (e.g., industry associations, developers? meetings, annual shareholder meetings, etc.) act as the sources of influence on adoption deci- sions [21].  The Bass [3] model, widely used in diffu- sion studies, argues that potential adopters are influ- enced by mass media and word of mouth [20]. In IS research, the diffusion of innovations theory has been used to study how technological innovations are em- braced at different levels of analysis. In the present research, the focal innovation is IT outsourcing.1 The related social system consists of firms that may be located across different geographic regions, are in different industries, and share similar characteristics that may make them competitors or business partners.

2.3. Contagion Effects  A contagion effect is defined as ?the spread of a particular type of behavior through time and space as a result of a prototype or model performing the beha- vior and either facilitating that behavior in the ob- server or reducing the observer?s inhibitions against performing that same behavior? [22, p. 1006]. Con- tagion effects theory offers a refined expression of the diffusion of innovations theory, and provides a starting point for understanding the underlying processes of diffusion [14]. It does so through eva- luating diffusion behavior on the basis of a different point of view.  This view posits the possibility of the connectedness of outsourcing events over time.  Con- tagion effects may arise in two ways. The first is spil- lovers due to normal ties and interdependencies among different activities in a market.  These include aligned senior management interests, business activi- ties in an industry, in a region, across firms with similar interests or operating characteristics, etc.

Another explanation is external to business, industry and geographical, based on macroeconomic drivers.

1 Loh and Venkatraman [19] refer to IT outsourcing as an administrative innovation. Another way to think of it is as a technological innovation, since outsourcing has been made possible through the communication capabilities of infor- mation and communications technologies.

Contagion effects theory has been used to explain the adoption patterns of successive technology gener- ations of analog and digital wireless phones [14].

The adoption patterns can be partly explained on the basis of hierarchical contagion effects.  They are defined as the effects of variables that influence the extent of the connection between the behavior of the units of analysis of interest over time. So we might see hierarchical effects across industries, geography, firms, strategic business units, senior managers, and so on.  Other studies use contagion effects theory and the related notion of co-movement to study how state- level shocks on the growth of networks propagate to the national level, and vice versa [13]. The theory has also been used to study the spread of financial turbu- lence, riots, civil disobedience, and other phenomena.

Another stream of research in which contagion ef- fects theory occurs is political science. The theory has been used to explain adoption of innovations [11] and social security policy by states [6], growth of terrorism [23], and other non-technological pheno- mena. One study on the spread of urban disorders in 1960s is especially interesting. Midlarsky [22] empir- ically tests whether the spread of civil disorders in small cities in the United States can be attributed to baseline diffusion effects, as well as hierarchical con- tagion effects. In Midlarsky?s work, the relevant hie- rarchical contagion effect that is proposed is the as- sociation between civil unrest in smaller cities and what has occurred in the larger cities ? a large city to small city effect.  He notes that this may occur even though there are differences in the critical mass of the minority populations in the smaller cities.

An important finding from the prior research is that contagion effects theory appears to be helpful in explaining fast-spreading, over-dispersed phenome- na.  We believe that it applies well to our efforts to explain the diffusion of IT outsourcing because the IT outsourcing data are over-dispersed.

3. HYPOTHESES  A US$625 million BPO deal signed between Nortel Networks and PricewaterhouseCoopers in 2000 was an important deal that had a major impact on the development of BPO outsourcing [28]. Some consider it as the deal that started the business process outsourcing wave [12]. Similarly, the out- sourcing deal between Eastman Kodak and IBM in 1989 had a significant impact on IT outsourcing and is believed to have established IT outsourcing as a strategic choice for successful businesses and re- sulted in diffusion of IT outsourcing. Loh and Venka- traman [19] have called this the Kodak effect.

Another way to think about these kinds of prob- lems is in modeling terms that describe the connec-  tedness of the events that precede later events, and the extent to which the events themselves are ran- dom. In our study, we find that the precipitating events, the mega-deals, are random and occur across unrelated industries and do not follow any fixed pat- tern. We can view randomly occurring independent precipitating events as potentially influencing the later diffusion of IT and BPO outsourcing.2 This oc- curs on a proportional basis, so the number of new outsourcing deal announcements is proportional to the number of deals that have been concluded: ? Hypothesis 1 (The Outsourcing Diffusion Hy-  pothesis): The outsourcing diffusion process will be randomly proportionate to the set of res- ponses to prior precipitating events.

Evidence of a contagion effect might include a  statistically significant increase in the number of IT outsourcing contract announcements in a period im- mediately following an earlier period which had IT outsourcing announcements from leading firms. Indi- cating presence of a contagion effect where the lead- ing firms act as prototype or model for other firms to follow. An alternative explanation is the hierarchical contagion effect that we mentioned earlier, which involves managerially interesting stratifiers and theory-based observations of their relevance: ? Hypothesis 2 (The Hierarchical Outsourcing  Adoption Hypothesis): With contagion effects, the diffusion of outsourcing will depend on the influence of one or several contagion variables whose effects act in a hierarchy.

The Outsourcing Diffusion Hypothesis (H1) cha-  racterizes patterns of IT outsourcing. The Hierarchic- al Outsourcing Adoption Hypothesis (H2) does this at a more fine-grained level. The hierarchical effect could be from larger to smaller firms, or from firms in close by to those that are farther away from each other.  We only consider hierarchical effects that oc- cur due to firm size. This is a good start for analysis, and is defensible. It is done in studies of firm perfor- mance and strategic management.

4. DATA  We used two data sets in this study. The first captures the IT outsourcing information at the indus-   2 A related technical requirement of the estimation models that we will use is the independence of the precipitating events.  Similar to Midlarsky [22], we conduct our analysis under the premise that this assumption is appropriate.  In fact, however, this is an empirical issue that requires addi- tional exploration and analysis on our part to nail down.

We can nail this down when we have more data from more industries and more diverse geography, for example, out- sourcing across different countries.

private sector provided by the Bureau of Labor Sta- tistics (BLS) and the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) for 1998 to 2006. The industries are defined by the four digits 1997 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).

Appendix 1 provides details on the sources, con- struction procedure, and deflators used for the indus- try data. We used chain-type quantity indices as def- lators,3 which show the growth of output (or other variables) over time holding prices constant [27].

The BEA introduced these indices in 1996 to im- prove the accuracy of its estimates of the growth in real GDP by eliminating the bias present in fixed- weight indices that had been used.

The second data set was collected from a full text search of company announcements related to IT and BPO outsourcing between April 1, 1999 and March 31, 2008. We used two leading news sources: PR Newswire and Business Wire. See Appendices 2 and 3.  We also used the online Lexis/Nexis database to search the news wires for announcements containing the words ?deal? or ?contract? or ?launch? or ?an- nouncement? in the same sentence as the words ?BPO? and ?IT,? and ?outsourcing? or ?offshoring.? The search yielded 583 announcements in total, of which 210 announcements were relevant.

Not all of the relevant details ? for example, dol- lar amounts for the contracts required for analysis ? were found in the company announcements, howev- er. To collect these data, we searched other secondary sources, including trade journals, company websites, magazine articles, and newspaper articles. We took extra care to differentiate between independent an- nouncements and announcements that were a part of ongoing deals. We only include independent an- nouncements. We collected announcement data at the firm level which involved either clients or vendors, or both that were located in the U.S.  We did this to   3 The BEA introduced the chain-type Fisher index into its measures of real output and prices to address the problem of choosing the base period with which all other periods are compared. This index is the geometric mean of the conven- tional fixed-weighted Laspeyres index, which uses the weights of the first period in a two-period setting, and the Paasche index, which relies on the weights of the second period. Changes in the Fisher index are calculated using the weights of adjacent years. These annual changes are chained or multiplied together to form a time-series that allows for the effects of changes in relative prices and in the composition of output over time.  See Landefeld and Parker [17] for additional details.

maintain consistency across the industry and firm- level data. Our final data set consisted of 70 an- nouncements with complete information.

5. INDUSTRY-LEVEL EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS  We look at the industry level IT outsourcing data and compare the patterns observed with the an- nouncement data that we collected. We expect to see similar kinds of empirical regularities that are specif- ic to the diffusion of IT outsourcing across firms.  We focus on 1999 to 2006 across a few industries where there is high usage of IT. We called these IT- intensive industries. We selected these industries because these industries have the largest share of the worldwide BPO market [4]. They include broadcast- ing and telecommunication (NAICS 5130) banking and finance (NAICS 5210, 5220 and 5230), computer systems design and related services (NAICS 5415), and information and data processing services (NAICS 5140).  Figures 1, 2, and 3 present IT out- sourcing trends over time within and across these NAICS industries over the same time period.

Fig. 1. Total Outsourcing in the IT-Intensive Industries by Year in US$, 1999 -2006   Fig. 2. IT Outsourcing Deal Announcements in the U.S., 1999-2006   We observe the following patterns across IT-  intensive industries. Based on industry-level data, there is sharp growth from 1999-2000 and then a sharp decline from 2000-2002, after this period we observe a steady growth. For our announcement data        for the same industries, there are similar patterns ex- cept for the period 2001-2002. Our data show an in- crease in the number of announcements during this period, except for this period. These observations suggest that: IT outsourcing has been growing consis- tently across IT-intensive industries from 2003 on- wards; and the industry outsourcing announcement data that we have collected reflect the industry trends except for the period of 2001-2002.

Fig. 3. IT Services by NAICS Industry in US$, 1999-2006   For the industry level of analysis, we see some-  what different patterns. Different industries followed similar patterns from 1999 to 2002, but from 2002 onwards somewhat different patterns occurred. When we compare the outsourcing patterns within different industries with that at industry level we find some marked differences. We observe a consistent growth pattern in the broadcasting and telecom industries.

5.1. Modeling Background  We examine the overall patterns of outsourcing at the firm level over time with a methodology based on the estimation of a lognormal diffusion model [1, 22]. The underlying reason for the application of this model to the study of outsourcing is its emphasis on the proportionate effect of the diffusion process. Our conjecture is that outsourcing diffusion develops over time via a mechanism in which each additional in- crement of outsourcing-related events is proportional to the existing size of the process ? in other words, the current installed base of outsourcing contracts.

We next provide empirical results to justify the appli- cation of this model to IT outsourcing.

5.2. Empirical Model Development  The lognormal distribution model has been used to describe different growth processes (e.g., personal income, gross national income, etc.). It incorporates an assumption of independence regarding observa- tions of diffusion. It incorporates a high degree of skewness and leptokurtosis, compared to other distri-  butions [1]. We apply this to test the diffusion pat- terns and gauge the proportionate effect for diffusion.

We next specify the lognormal diffusion model that we will apply to our data. Let {?i} be the set of mutually independent random drivers for IT out- sourcing growth, and {xi} be the dollar amounts as- sociated with the set of i = 1 to n outsourcing an- nouncements.  The variation among the announce- ments is expressed by the different dollar amounts of the underlying contracts. Based on the reasoning that we discussed involving a proportionate effect, the incremental change, xi ? xi-1, should be a random pro- portion of the existing value: xi ? xi-1, = ?ixi-1, i = 1, 2, ?, n                           (1)  Equation 1 can be interpreted as the change in the dollar amount of IT outsourcing as the result of an additional announcement and is proportional to the size of the dollar amount of the IT outsourcing contract. The equation can be stated as the fundamen- tal equation underlying a lognormal distribution [1]: log xn = log x0 + ?1 + ?2 + ... + ?n                           (2)  Log xn is normally distributed in the limit by the additive form of the central limit theorem. So xn also is lognormally-distributed as:  f (x) = 1 x? 2?  exp ? 12 log x ? m  ?                 , x > 0       (3)  where m is the mean of the logarithm of x with stan- dard deviation .  The parameters m and  can be estimated by two additional equations:  m = log2 xi  i=1  n   n  (4)  ? 2 = (log2 xi ? m)   i=1  n   n ? 1  (5)  This model gives us an opportunity to look at whether the data exhibit proportional behavior and fits the lognormal distribution. If the model does not fit, then we might have to extend it by including other variables, a different functional form or different un- derlying assumptions to capture the true behavior.

5.3. Statistical Tests of the Main Hypothesis  The main purpose of this part of our analysis is to see if the lognormal distribution fits our data. If the distribution fits then we can conclude that the IT dif- fusion follows a normal growth pattern. To accom- plish this, we use the 2 goodness of fit test. The null hypothesis is whether the frequency distribution of the relevant events observed in our sample is consis- tent with a lognormal distribution  The variable xi is the dollar amount for each out-        sourcing announcement as before. We use logarith- mic (base 10) values for the dollar amounts to define announcement categories. The different categories are defined as follows: 105 for $100K-$1M, 106 for $1M-$10M, and so on. All outsourcing contract an- nouncements had value more than $100K thus we selected our start value as 105. For analysis purposes, we selected the beginning points of each range rather than the mid-points to represent the logarithmic val- ues. This does not change our conclusion, since it applies to all categories.

From Equations 2 and 3, we can see that log xi is normally distributed, and this form is necessary for us to implement the 2 test. Table 1 reports the values that we obtained with k-3 degrees of freedom, with k representing the number of categories.

5.4. Results for the Base Modeling Approach Our null hypothesis is that our data follows a  lognormal distribution. Our analysis shows that the observed distribution does not fit the lognormal dis- tribution very well though. This is reflected in the ?2 value of 11.90 (1 d.f.). Most of the observed values demonstrate positive skewness. For the US$ catego- ries 105,108 and 109, the observed values are higher than the expected values. Also, the observed values in the upper range of US$1 to 100 million of the an- nouncement data are under-represented, whereas those in the lower range of US$100 million to US$10 billion are over-represented.

The under-representation of US$1 billion-plus deals can be explained on the basis of industry trends.

In the IT outsourcing industry, not many mega-deals have been signed. Those that have been signed en- compass services contracts for multiple locations across multiple nations and sometimes even multiple business functions. The number of vendors that can provide such large-scale services based in the U.S. is small, as suggested by our data. A plausible explana- tion for the over-representation of the lower dollar range deals may be that higher dollar outsourcing deals get more press.  Clearly, we have some addi-  tional details to understand in this context.

Our results suggest that the lognormal distribu-  tion may not be capable of characterizing the diffu- sion patterns of IT outsourcing for the data and time period that we used. There are two possible explana- tions. First, the model may not be suitable, even though the lognormal model is generally appropriate for representing over-dispersed data. Our data are over-dispersed beyond the range of lognormal distri- bution. Another possibility is that some other process is at work here, such that the combination of two processes makes a single pattern representation of the lognormal model ineffective.

6. EXTENSION AND RESULTS  To capture the patterns of diffusion beyond the lognormal model, we need to adjust our approach.

6.1. Background on the Modeling Extension  We evaluate our data longitudinally as the sum of the dollar amounts of announcements.  These should approximate a straight line if the announce- ments occur randomly.  We also test for the presence of a hierarchical contagion effect in diffusion for IT outsourcing. Prior diffusion contagion studies [6, 14] have shown that adoption follows a hierarchical pat- tern. We represent the hierarchical adoption effect in term of large and small firms. Diffusion patterns in prior studies suggest that a hierarchical contagion effect may come into play when we see a rapid in- crease in the outcome variable of interest.  In this case, it is the number of outsourcing announcements following news of a mega-deal. To test for a hierar- chical contagion, we analyze outsourcing announce- ment frequency by firm size, for different time pe- riods. We use the number of employees for firm size.

(See Appendix 4.) We check for over or under- representation of mid-to-small firms.

6.2. Variables and Empirical Model  Pattern analysis. To represent the data in longi- tudinal form, we adopt the transformation equations from Midlarsky [22] in our context. We sum the dol- lar amounts of announcements and apply log trans- formations to them. We represent the dollar amount associated with announcements i = {1, ?, n} as xi, with ?i representing the random precipitating event ? the mega-deals.  The related expression is:  x1 = k1e?1, x2 = k2e?2, ?, xn = kne?n                   (6) where ki is the constant of proportionality between the dollar amount and the exponential function.

Multiplying Eq. 6?s terms by one another gives:  1 1 1  [ ] n n n  i i i i i  i i i  x k e k e? ?  = = =  = =? ? ?        ...1 2 1 2( ,..., ) nnk k k e  ? ? ?+ + +=                 (7)  The log of Equation 7 is: log (x1x2 ,?, xn) = k?(?1 + ?2 + ? + ?n)   i=1  n  log xi = k?(?1 + ?2 + ? + ?n)       (8) Precipitating incidents occur in time-order, so ?n  occurs after ?n-1. Thus:   log ''i n  i  x k t =  =                                         (9)  It follows that the sum of the logarithms of the dollar amounts of the outsourcing deals is propor- tional to time. To understand the overall pattern, we plotted the logarithms of the cumulative outsourcing dollar amounts for 1999 to 2007 in Figure 4.

Fig. 4. Outsourcing Events by Year, 1999 to 2007   We see marked differences in the pattern be-  tween years.  Three years ? 2000, 2003 and 2006 ? are of interest to explore the contagion effect pheno- mena because of the rapid increase we see in the an- nouncement data. To get an understanding of how the dollar amounts are distributed, we plotted the log of total outsourcing deal values for selected quarters from 2002 to 2007 in Figure 5.

We observe a rapid growth in the log of the dol- lar amounts of outsourcing deals from 1999 to 2000, from 2002 to 2003, and from 2005 to 2006. These periods of rapid increases coincide with the periods in which we observed either mega-deal announce- ments or multiple announcements that are above US$100 million. Although we have not tested this for significance, we observed an increase in the number of smaller dollar amount deals that appear to follow these higher-value deals also.

To test the hypothesis of hierarchical contagion effects, we tabulated the number of announcements by firm size for this time period. We did this for 2003, 2006 and 2007, and for all the other years  where we did not see a rapid increase in the cumula- tive logarithmic dollar amounts. 4 See Table 2.

Fig. 5. Log of Total Outsourcing in Selected Quarters in US$, 1999-2007   We test for whether the proportion of smaller  sized firms is greater in the contagion periods as compared to that in the non-contagion periods, as suggested by the contagion theory. We find that the proportion of smaller firms is greater in the contagion period. Thus, there seems to be a hierarchical conta- gion effect: smaller firms adopt based on the external influence of large outsourcing-adopting firms? adop- tion.  More analysis is needed to confirm the finding.

There are 16 announcements in the data set for which no client information was available, and so we did not include them.

An alternative explanation, but one that still represents a hierarchical contagion is based on deal size.  For example, it may be the case that observa- tions of larger deals by different firms drive their willingness to do larger deals themselves.  Similarly, smaller deals may beget other smaller deals that cut   4 It is important to ask: What are the alternative explana- tions for these patterns? How can they be excluded? For example, the years 2002 and 2005 had improving economic conditions. These may have enabled firms to do more IT outsourcing.  Smaller deals may have increased more than bigger ones because they required more financial resources.

We have not tested this assertion directly, but it is possible to conceptualize this as a hierarchical diffusion effect.  It would be led by the financial condition of the firms.  We will explore number of alternative explanations like this in more data work as we further develop this research.

across other hierarchical stratifiers.  A related possi- bility is that the contagion effects are neither driven by firm size or deal size.  Instead, these  may be dri- ven by the deal vendors, so that mega-deals or small- er deals with a particular vendor may lead to other deals that are observed in the market with the same vendor.  We are exploring these alternative explana- tions so we can present more refined results in the future.

7. DISCUSSION  The topic of diffusion patterns of IT has been of long-standing interest to researchers in IS, marketing and economics. Our focus has been on understanding IT outsourcing and business process outsourcing from the perspective of contagion effects theory.

7.1. Contagion Effects of IT Outsourcing  In the first part of our study we asserted that the diffusion pattern of IT and BPO outsourcing will be randomly proportionate to the set of announcements, which are responses to prior precipitating events. We also asserted that in the presence of contagion effect, the diffusion of IT outsourcing to small firms de- pends on the extent of outsourcing penetration in large firms, a hierarchical contagion effect.

We obtained evidence that showed that the diffu- sion of IT outsourcing is not distributed lognormally, which does not match our initial modeling assertion.

Our analysis showed the presence of other underlying drivers, like hierarchical contagion effects, that do not allow the diffusion pattern to be lognormal. By analyzing the frequency of outsourcing announce- ments based on the firm size we were able to obtain evidence for the hierarchical contagion effect.  This indicated that the diffusion pattern of outsourcing for smaller firms depends on the extent of outsourcing diffusion among the larger firms.

7.2. Broader Theoretical Implications  Contagion effect theory provides a way to assess diffusion patterns from a number of different pers- pectives based on the choice variable for stratifica- tion. It is appropriate to try out several hierarchical diffusion stratifiers to identify a significant effect.

Another implication of this research is that the analytical and theoretical techniques we applied may be useful in studying diffusion patterns in analogous settings, where the analysis hypothesizes the presence of some kind of hierarchical contagion effect. For example, contagion-theoretic diffusion patterns may be observed for adoption of mobile payment systems, electronic billing systems, or social networking sites.

8. CONCLUSION  We conclude with the primary contributions of  our research, and then we consider limitations.

8.1. Contributions  The results of this study have theoretical and practical implications. We apply diffusion contagion effects theory in a new context: to study the diffusion patterns of IT outsourcing. This helps us to under- stand hierarchical adoption patterns in this context.

Our perspective is to look at aspects of the growth pattern for IT outsourcing that does not fit the expec- tations of a simple baseline model. We also demon- strate a new methodology for empirical research on IS diffusion: the lognormal model.

A problem with this type of field research on out- sourcing is the difficulty in obtaining meaningful data. We created a new data set, which provides a different vantage point for the analysis of contagion effect-driven IT outsourcing diffusion. We also dem- onstrated the analogical development of an empirical model from medical epidemiology and political science, something which offers an interesting pers- pective on the broader development of new metho- dology for the IS field. Our results also will help managers understand the diffusion patterns of IT out- sourcing, at the industry and firm level. This will enable them to make decisions related to IT outsourc- ing with an awareness of the macro and micro levels.

Our results are specifically helpful for vendors, who stand to gain a lot by making the information about their contract wins public. Especially if their clients are either high profile clients or the contract deals are high value.

8.2. Limitations  We note several limitations of the present re- search that we will address in future work. First, our results are based on outsourcing contract announce- ments and contract details from two well-accepted news sources.  So they may be biased to the extent that not all outsourcing contract announcements and details are covered by these sources. Also, the an- nouncement rate and time are dependent on corporate guidelines and because of that there might be a time lag, between the time when actual contract is signed and the announcement is released. Still they represent industry trends, so excluding contracts not covered by these sources probably has not adversely affected our results. Also, our results are similar to Loh and Venkatraman?s [19], who showed organizations mimic the behavior of other organizations in terms of the use of their communication channels.

Second, we have focused on firm size as our main stratifier for observing contagion effects. There are other possible criteria that can be used to analyze          the contagion effect, for instance, geographic loca- tion, industry, international linkages, IT-intensity, and managerial structure, etc.  The variable that we chose, firm size, is measurable and valid based on our field study observation, and consistent with control variables used in other research on firm strategy [7, 24]. Size via scale economies is important because it represents how firms can produce internally, if they make the decision to outsource. Third, the trend of IT and BPO outsourcing is very recent in companies for the smallest two size categories of firms.

This study is exploratory.  We focused on the overall pattern of IT outsourcing.  We have given no consideration to external factors, like regulatory and non-business considerations that may influence the diffusion of IT outsourcing within an industry or even across different geographic locations.  These are issues that we will explore in continuing research.
