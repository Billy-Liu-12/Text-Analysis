Research on Semi-automatic Domain Ontology

AbstractOntology as an important knowledge representation  tool is widely used in many fields. The most popular way to  construct domain ontology is by manual. However,  constructing domain ontology is a lengthy and costly thing.

Research on construction of domain ontology is becoming  increasingly widespread in computer science community. In  this paper, an approach to semi-automatically constructing  domain ontology based on Chinese word partition and data  mining is proposed. The method is proved to be effective and  also assures the quality of the ontology at a certain level.

I. INTRODUCTION  Ontology as a concept representation can describe  concepts and the relations among them in the semantic layer.

It has been widely used ever since it was proposed. However,  it is a both lengthy and hard thing to construct domain  ontology by full manual, which limits the spread of ontology  application. Ontology learning shows enormous significance  and value in theory and practice. How to construct domain  ontology fast has become a hot research topic.



II. RELATED WORK  A. Brief Introduction of Ontology  Ontology is originally a philosophical concept which  explains the real world systematically. In the computer  science, artificial intelligence first brought it in. Gruber gave  the most popular definition of ontology an explicit  specification of the concept model in 1993[1]. Later Studer  made the further study and defined ontology as formal and  explicit specifications of the shared concept model [2].

Generally speaking, ontology is a concept model used to  describe the concepts and the relations among them.

B. The Framework of Semi-automatic Domain Ontology  System  The semi-automatic domain ontology system designed in  this paper mainly consists of three parts: the extraction    module of domain concepts and the extraction module of  taxonomy and non-taxonomy relations among domain  concepts. Statistical analysis method, generalized suffix tree  and clustering method and association rule mining method  are respectively adopted in the above three parts. The system  framework is illustrated in Figure. 1[3].

III. AUTOMATIC EXTRACTION OF DOMAIN CONCEPTS  A. Framework of Extracting Domain Concepts  The framework of extracting domain concepts is  illustrated in Figure.2.

Figure 2.  The framework of extracting domain concepts  Supported by the Nature Science Foundation of JiangSu province of  China (NO.BK2008354).s)  2010 Seventh Web Information Systems and Applications Conference  978-0-7695-4193-8/10 $26.00  2010 IEEE  DOI 10.1109/WISA.2010.41     B. Extraction of Compound Words  First the corpus is segmented into words that exist in the  common words dictionary. Word segment algorithm  contains machinery matching algorithm and understanding  type syncopation. Currently many kinds of open-source  software can be used for the segmentation of Chinese. In this  paper ICTCLAS (Chinese Lexical Analysis System  developed by Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese  Academy of Science) is adopted as a word segmentation  tool.

The steps of extracting compound words can be divided  into four steps:  Step1: Segment the corpus text into words, and then  determine the scope of words. For example, for one text C in  the corpus, it can be expressed as ncccC ,,, 21 L=  after  segmented; in which ic  represents a word.

Step2: Partition the segmented text by inserting  separators. Numbers, special symbols, Chinese virtual  characters and blank lines all can be used as separators. For  example, partitioned text C can be expressed  as njjii cccccccC ,,/,,,/,,,,, 1121 LLL ++= .

Step3: Construct the candidate list of compound words  from the corpus text obtained in step2. According to the  statistic analysis of Chinese corpus, the length of  compound words is generally less than five words. For  the segmented corpus, the average length of the words is  1.6. So the structure of compound words like 2-gram,  3-gram or 4-gram (that means compound words are  composed by two, three or four words) is valid. For the  first part c1, c2, c3, c4 of the text C, the candidate  compound words are: c1c2, c2c3, c3c4, clc2c3, c2c3c4,  clc2c3c4. 2-gram parts are: c1c2, c2c3, 3c4, 3-gram parts  are: clc2c3, c2c3c4, and 4-gram parts are: clc2c3c4.

Step4: Determine whether there is a high degree of  relativity among the candidate compound words, and then  derive the complete compound words.

C.  The Parameters of Domain Concept Extraction  There are mainly three parameters used to judge the  validity of the compound words.

a) Mutual information [4] [5] is widely used to evaluating  the degree of relativity between two strings a, b in statistical  language model. The formula of mutual information is as  follows:  )()()(  )(  )()()(  )(  abfbfaf  abf  abpbpap  abpMIab ?+=?+=    (1)  b)Context dependency analysis [5] is used to judge  integrity of a word combination. It contains left and right  context dependency.

c)Domain relativity analysis [6] needs to be done on the  domain concepts. TF-IDF (term frequencyinverse  document frequency) is used to analyze the domain relativity  of words.



IV. AUTOMATIC EXTRACTION OF THE RELATIONS AMONG  THE DOMAIN CONCEPTS  The relations among domain concepts have two types:  taxonomy and non-taxonomy [7]. The concepts in ontology  are generally composed of domain keywords. Domain    keywords have two types: (1) compound words, namely the  non-existed words in the dictionary; (2) common words,  namely the existed words in the dictionary, can be obtained  immediately from the segmented text.

A. Extraction of Taxonomy Relation based on Generalized  Suffix Tree  A generalized suffix tree [8] is such a suffix tree that  contains all the suffixes of the string set },,{ 1 nss L . The  method based on generalized suffix tree is described as  follows:  Input: The list of concepts ConceptList, supposing the  length of the list is n  Output: Concepts that have the same suffix  Step1: Construct a generalized suffix tree  Step2: Traverse the generalized suffix tree and record the  list that consists of all the leaves of the tree. Name the list  LeafNodeList. Traverse the leaves in the LeafNodeList.

If the identifier in the leaf node is larger than 1, the content  of the leaf node is the desired suffix.

Step3: Obtain the longest suffix from concept words with  the same suffix.

B. Extraction of Taxonomy Relation based on Clustering  If two words are always used in the similar context, the  two words are the same kind. So taxonomy relation can be     extracted through clustering. The context of a word is  expressed by the vector in the word space.

1) Construction of the Word Space  Word space model is a multi-dimensional vector space  model constructed by obtaining the statistical information of  the corpus. Each vector in the space represents a domain  concept. The vector in the word space is constructed with  4-grams in the context.

The concrete steps of constructing word space are as  follows:  Step1: Read all the domain concepts obtained in the  concept extraction module, and establish word list of domain  concept. Name the list ConceptList. Suppose the number  of concept in ConceptList is n.

Step2: For the qth ( nq ,,2,1 L= ) concept word w in  ConceptList, construct its context vector representation.

When w is in the ith position, the vector is expressed  as ( )ijiji gagagaw L,, 2211=? , in which ijggg L,, 21  is 4-gram of  iw  and ijaaa L,, 21  are separately the  occurrence number of  ijggg L,, 21 . The number of  chosen 4-gram can be specified as parameters by users.

Step3: In all the positions ( )wp , construct its context  vector representation. Finally, add all the context vectors can  obtain the vector representation of w : ( )nqWq ,,2,1 L=? ,  ( )??

?? =  wpi  iq wW . All the vectors of concept words constitute  vector space. Repeat step 2 and 3 on each concept word in  ConceptList, then the word space  ?

C  can be obtained and  represented as },,{ 21  ???? = nWWWC L .

2) Calculation of the Similarity among Domain  Concepts  Here cosine law is adopted to calculate  similarity:  ??

21 , WWsim  between vector  ?

1W  and  ?

2W .

??

?????? =??

???

?=??

,  2121 ,cos,  WbWa  WbWa  ba  ab  WWWWsim  (2)  Cosine law in essence is using the geometry angles  cosine between vector  ?

1W  and  ?

2W . Larger the distance of  two vectors is, smaller the cosine value is; on the contrary,  the similarity is lower.

3) K-Means Clustering Algorithm of Choosing the  Initial Optimization Center based on "Min-Max" Principle  Here K-Means clustering algorithm based on the  "min-max" principle was adopted to choose initial centers.

The "min-max" principle can ensure the distance between  the initial centers far enough. Firstly choose two domain  concepts with the minimum similarity from the similarity  matrix as the initial centers. Secondly for each non-center  domain concept, obtain the ones which have the maximum  similarity with the existed centers. Finally choose the  domain concepts with the minimum similarity from those  maximum similarities as new centers. Suppose the number  of chosen centers is m, then recurrence formula of the  (m+1)th center is as follows:  },,2,1],,,2,1),,(max{min[ mjmixxd ij LL ?=      (3)  According to the rule that the distance between adjacent  centers should grow stable, then determine mutation point  k. The number of centers should be less than the square of  the number of clustering data, that means nk < . The  concept center depth is calculated as the following:  |)(min)1(min||)1(min)(min|)( idistidistidistidistiDepth ?++??=   (4)  The center domain concepts prior to the max Depth(i) are  chosen as center, and the following ones become non- center.

K-Means clustering algorithm is as the follows:  Step1: Divide the non- center domain concepts into the  clusters of nearest center.

Step2: Choose new centers from the clusters where  similarity of domain concepts must exceed the appointed  value.

Repeat step1, 2 until the obtained centers or cluster set  become stable.

C. Extraction of Non-taxonomy Relations  Compared to the extraction of taxonomy relations, the  extraction of non-taxonomy is more difficult. Extracting the  related concept pairs is the key. The method based on  association rules mining is adopted to extract related concept  pairs. The algorithm of extracting related concept pairs is as  follows:  Output: the set of related concept pairs.

Step1: Construct a concept pair set by gathering every  two different concepts.

Step2: For each concept pair in the set, calculate the  support and the confidence based on association rules mining  algorithm.

If both support and confidence satisfy MinSup and  MinConf, the concept pair is related; else the pair must be  deleted.

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK  Nowadays it is also quite difficult to construct a common  and mature tool used for constructing ontology  semi-automatically. The methods in this paper adopted  accelerate the construction of ontology to some extent, but  there are still many defects. (1)Choosing data source is by  manual .This reduces the automatic degree and efficiency.

(2)Extract compound words without taking into account the  characteristics of language. (3) The method that analyze  different grammatical components of sentence to conclude  the relations among concepts can be tried.
