Abstract?Peculiar feature of ferroelectrics is high dielectric  permittivity ? which sometimes is accompanied by very big loss tangent tan?. This is a reason of difficulties to obtain accurate characterization despite of variety of techniques available. This report is devoted to the selection of proper waveguide method for specific cases of bulk or film materials investigation to obtain reliable data of their ? and tan?.



I. INTRODUCTION Main difference of ferroelectrics and related materials is  their large dielectric constant (? ~ 102 ? 104). Sometimes, this high ? is accompanied with big loss factor (tan? ~ 0.01 ? 1).

Related materials with tan? ~ 10-3 with ? ~ 102 are also available, and quite different methods should be used to characterize them.

High-? materials are important for numerous applications in microwave components such as dielectric resonators, dielectric substrates, decoupling capacitors, absorbent materials, phase shifters, etc.

Ferroelectrics are important object in solid state physics as well because of their phase transitions. Lattice dynamics theory predicts strong anomalies in ferroelectric properties just at the microwaves. Ferroelectric domain switching in thin films also takes place at microwaves. Therefore, accurate and reliable measuring of dielectric constant and loss in ferroelectrics and related materials remains an actual problem  of material science as well as electronic industry.

Main microwave methods used for high-? materials study  are classified in Fig. 1. At present, methods for microwave measurement of usual dielectrics with ? of about 2?100 and low loss are well developed. Some of them use vector network analyzer [1]. There are some studies dedicated to ferroelectrics [2]. Nevertheless, this technique should be improved now using the vast possibilities of present-day microwave network analyzers.

Because of high permittivity, microwave measuring of ferroelectrics faces difficulties. Open systems such as microstrip line suffer from approximations, while coaxial line is inconvenient to make ceramics or crystal samples of cylinder or disk form.

In some ferroelectric crystals dielectric properties are strongly anisotropic, and require investigation in the one- directional electric field. The major problem of high-? dielectric microwave study is a poor interaction of electromagnetic wave with studied specimen.

Due to the difference in the wave impedance, most part of electromagnetic energy reflects from air-dielectric boundary and can not penetrate the specimen. That is why, short- circuited waveguide method exhibit lack of sensitivity. If the loss of dielectric is also big, the sample of a few millimeters length looks like ?endless?. For the same reason, in the transmission experiment, only a small part of electromagnetic  Fig 1. Microwave methods of ferroelectrics` study     MRRS-2008 Symposium Proceedings. Kiev, Ukraine, September 22-24, 2008  energy passes through the sample to output that is not sufficient for network analyzer accurate operation.



II. BULK FERROELECTRICS STUDY Short-circuit line and transmission/reflection methods  were introduced years ago. However, reliable and accurate measurement of ferroelectric materials with extremely high permittivity and loss still remains an actual problem.

Fig. 2. Measurement scheme: a) short-circuit line method, b) transmission /reflection method.

The air filled section of waveguide, the transformer, and the testing sample are represented by normalized transmission matrices , which are the functions of lengths and electromagnetic properties of neighbor areas. Transmission matrices of whole network can be obtained by the multiplication of each area transmission matrices:  T%  . 1 1[ ] n n?= ? ? ?T T T T% % % %K In drawn formula the matrix that correspond the first area  on the wave?s way is rightmost in product. Then, for the convenience, the network transmission matrices can be converted into scattering matrices whose parameters are measured directly.

Proper choice of weight is a function important for correct  data processing. Among possible ways, there are weighted derivatives, and the modulus of reflection or transmission coefficients. These methods emphasize the influence of points near the minimum values of the reflection or transmission,  which just exactly have the highest sensitivity to properties of studied material.

The choice between short-circuited line or transmission/ reflection methods depends on which method has better sensitivity, and should be applied individually.

Three common and easily available materials were used for experimental study (Table I). Samples were prepared in the rectangular shape that is adjusted to X-band waveguide cross section. Side edges of samples for all experiments were covered by silver paste.

Introduced conception of partial filling of waveguide with studied material facilitates the examination of expensive or rare materials when big sample is difficult to prepare.



III. DIFFERENT METHODS OF FERROELECTRIC FILMS STUDY Deposited on a substrate large-? ferroelectric film is one of  microwave material of increasing technical interest. Such film is very promising for applications in the monolithic microwave integrated circuits ? MMIC. Ferroelectric films are applied as by-pass on-chip capacitors, voltage tunable capacitors [3], frequency agile resonant filters [4], microwave phase shifters for steerable antennas [5], etc.

The calculation and design of mentioned devices need an exact value of the film parameters ? and tan? obviously measured at microwaves. In-process measurement of film dielectric parameters is important for experimental specification during film deposition and annealing.

The accurate measurement of ferroelectric films dielectric properties is an actual problem for material science as well. A comparison of bulk-to-film change properties is an interesting question of ferroelectric physics. Ferroelectrics are highly sensitive to any influence. It is important to learn about what is changed when bulk ferroelectric crystal (that is a three- dimensional, 3-D) is transformed into a thin crystalline layer (2-D film). Previous studies of ferroelectric films at low frequencies describe mostly ferroelectric domains and impurities behavior, while microwave investigation should characterize crystal lattice properties. So ferroelectric film ? and tan? parameters, obtained at microwaves, reflect fundamental polarization mechanism [6].

Considerable change in bulk-to-film abilities could be either favorable or an adverse factor for microwave electronic devices. Good example is a ferroelectric solid solution of (Ba,Sr)TiO3 = BST that is the most studied material for     MRRS-2008 Symposium Proceedings. Kiev, Ukraine, September 22-24, 2008  microwave applications. Tunability in film is weaker than in bulk ceramic. However, lucky for many microwave devices, BST film dielectric permittivity (?film = 102 - 103) is many times less than dielectric constant of ceramics (? = 103 - 104) that is very important for device matching with the microwave line. Temperature dependence of ?film is much smoothed comparing to bulk ceramics that provides more thermal stability of film based device [7].

The problem is that ferroelectric film microwave properties are difficult to measure due to its large dielectric permittivity and very small thickness. Moreover, ferroelectric film dielectric permittivity might be anisotropic parameter (it is a second rank tensor). Its normal component ?n may be as greater so lesser than in-plane component ??.

Many methods of ferroelectric film investigation at radio- frequencies and microwaves are possible [10]. Elaborated methods can be divided on two groups: with and without electrodes, Fig. 2.

A parallel plate miniature capacitor is formed with electrodes deposition and can be used to determine ?n [9], whereas a planar capacitor is suitable to measure ?? [4]. By similar way, the microstrip transmission line can be used to find the normal component ?n, whereas coplanar transmission line allows to get tangential component ??, Fig. 4.

Without electrodes, employing microwave microscope [11], it is possible to estimate ?n but only in a very little local area of the film. By scanning the average data might be obtained. Such data are required to study film imperfections.

However, the integral parameter of a whole film might be quite different form local values of dielectric permittivity.

Microwave devices mostly use in-plane component, ??.

Consequently, in-process of measurement of integral (whole film) dielectric parameters is important for experimental specification during film deposition and annealing. Therefore, film laboratory test should be a non-destructive one. In this case the same film, preliminarily studied at the microwaves, might be used for device fabrication.

Microwave methods of ferroelectric film investigations are examined in [7] and [8], while review [9] carried out the analysis of films parameters obtained at microwaves. There are only solitary mentions as to electrode-less study of  ferroelectric film. These data relates to a polycrystalline film only. Firstly, by the quasi-optical method, in the frequency range of 300-600 GHz, obtained by sol-gel technology, ~4 ?m thickness polycrystalline BaTiO3 and BST films, deposited onto MgO ceramic substrate, were investigated [6]. Secondly, polycrystalline ~1?m sol-gel SrTiO3 film, deposited onto silica, was studied by the resonant cavity method near the frequency of 10 GHz [8],  As to the epitaxial film (that has the largest interest in MMIC applications) practically no contact-less measurements are reported. It is remarkable that listed in the review [9] all published experimental data regarding to the epitaxial ferroelectric film are drawn with the use of electrodes. Using electrodes, it is difficult to distinguish between the loss in the film itself and loss in the metal/film interface.

The opposite-electrodes method, for instance, is employed to study system Pt/BST/Pt [10] where 0.1?m BST film is obtained by the metal-organic chemical vapor deposition.

Dielectric constant is not notified but too low tan? = 0.006 looks like an evidence that ferroelectric properties of studied film are suppressed.

Sandwich configuration of electrodes is used for miniature SrTiO3 capacitors microwave study in [11]. Only a capacitance but no data on dielectric permittivity is reported, because strong influence of electrode onto film loss tangent is difficult to estimate.

Microwave investigation of microstrip line with the BST film situated between Pt and Ag electrodes shows ? ? 200?50 [12], but authors are not able to determine dielectric loss due to a large attenuation of microwave signal by metallic electrodes.

As it is shown in Fig. 2, electrode-less film ?? is possible to obtain by the resonant methods [12], [13]. In both cases the opened microwave systems are used for measurements that makes difficult to provide strict electrodynamics analysis.

Moreover, ferroelectric film might have big loss (on some stages of its deposition or annealing) and reduce accuracy of resonant methods.

Common techniques for studying dielectric materials in the waveguide usually rely on the measurement of complex scattering parameters of the waveguide which is filled with  Fig 4. Different methods of ferroelectrics film study     MRRS-2008 Symposium Proceedings. Kiev, Ukraine, September 22-24, 2008  materials to be studied [14]. Such techniques can be adapted for the measurement of layered structures where properties of one layer are unknown and to be determined. However, such an approach faces obvious difficulties with thin films. Simple estimation shows that 1 ?m thick film with ? = 1000 and tan? = 0.05 placed in the X-band waveguide cross section induces phase perturbation of only about 0.4?, and brings attenuation of about 0.002 dB. These values are obviously out of equipment resolution capabilities.

An additional complication is that the electrodes, as a rule, should be the multi-layered ones to provide good adhesion to film. Usually employed pre-coat is titanium (or chromium) that has much higher resistance than the upper gold electrode.

Due to this reason, and because of very thin skin-layer, and electrode roughness, it is difficult to take proper account of the skin effect influence onto measured film tan?.

As a rule, epitaxial ferroelectric film parameters are studied in the design of planar capacitor, with the use of interdigital electrodes deposited onto the opened surface of the film deposited onto dielectric substrate [3]. By this method, film parameters usually are obtained at the frequency of about 1 MHz, and next this information is applied to the microwave device elaboration. This assumption is not good grounded, because of ferroelectrics show strong frequency dispersion in their dielectric properties.

Ferroelectric film placed between coplanar electrodes were investigated at microwaves as well, [5], [12], and [13]. Film parameters can be extracted from complex impedance of investigated phase shifter, which is a coplanar line. However, any opened system is characterized by the radiation loss that has to be taken into account. This way of measurements usis rather complicated opened system, in which microwave propagation has to be assigned to three dielectrics: film itself, substrate under film, and air above film, while electrodes influence should be considered as well.

That is why, as in case that planar capacitor so for coplanar line, the calculation of dielectric permittivity and especially loss tangent looks quite approximate. Moreover, in the most of metering methods, mentioned in the review [9], microwave ? and tan? of a ?natural film? remain unknown, because a complex system of ?electrode-film-electrode? with substrate and radiation influence are investigated.

To improve film deposition technology as well as to elaborate calculated microwave device based on film parameters, ?natural film? electrical properties are urgent, just before electrode deposition, and, certainly, at microwaves.



IV. NON-RESONANT METHOD OF FILM INVESTIGATION To force microwave to propagate along film, the metallic  electrodes are usually used. However, ferroelectric-metal interface?s loss shades film?s natural properties. Film surface metallization should be avoided because it characterizes mainly the interface loss. Another problem is strong anisotropy of thin films caused by surface stress. That is why, field orientation during measurement should correspond its operation conditions in the MMIC.

Fig. 5. Schematic representation of experiment.

To improve film deposition technology as well as to  elaborate device based on this film, its intrinsic electrical properties are urgent just before the electrode deposition, and certainly at microwaves. Moreover, accurate and reliable measuring of ferroelectric films dielectric properties is an actual problem not only of electronic industry but for material science as well.

Taking into account all above mentioned, it is proposed to arrange film-on-substrate ?sandwich? along the waveguide as shown on Fig. 5. An important advantage of proposed scheme is the arrangement of measurement object in the area of the most strong electric field, that is in the center of waveguide for the basic mode. If film is arranged along the waveguide, the interaction is performed on the whole length of the sample.

Waveguide is a closed system thus there is no radiation loss.

Like for the bulk material study, the frequency dependence of scattering parameters should be investigated here also.

Depending on sensitivity, the transmission in the 2-port system or the reflection in a shorted waveguide should be investigated. In both cases, complex transmission or reflection coefficient decreases according to film loss in the ?sandwich? while wavelength shortens according to film permittivity.

To estimate the value of parameter and its sensitivity to the film?s influence, a theoretical analysis was performed. Using a longitudinal wave representation, electromagnetic field problem was reduced to the nonlinear equation on propagation constant:  ,cotatan  ;cotatan  ;tantan  ? ? ?  ?  ? ? ?  ? ?? ?  ? ?? ?  ? ? ? ?  ? ? ? +?  ? ?+?  ? ?  ? ? ? +?=?  ? ?  ? ? ?  ? ?? ?  ? ?? ?  ? ? ? ?  ? ? ? ??  ? ?  +? ? ?  ? ? ? ??=?  ? ? ?  ? ? ? ????=?  ? ?  ? ? ? ????  f f  fff  s s  sss  fffsss  dada  dada  aa      where ?,?s,?f  ? transverse wave numbers that can be found as 22 ???=? k , ? alone refers to the non-filled part of waveguide, where ? = 1; ds ? substrate thickness; df ? film thickness.

Given equation was solved numerically to obtain the propagation constant, which then was used to calculate the reflection coefficient using the transmission matrices approach (for the 2-port system, a transmission coefficient has to be calculated as well). As a reference point, a 0.25mm substrate with ?S =10 was chosen, while film dielectric constant is supposed to be ? = 1000.

The second reference measurement was performed with pure MgO substrate (without film). This measurement makes     MRRS-2008 Symposium Proceedings. Kiev, Ukraine, September 22-24, 2008  it possible to determine more precise values of substrate parameters taking into account metallization loss as well. For 20mm long 0.92mm thick MgO substrate we got permittivity ? = 9.99 and loss tan? = 0.005. Relatively high loss caused by quality of metallization.

Fig. 6. Thin film measurement processing  The main experiment was with 0.8?m BST film deposited by laser ablation technique onto the 0.92mm MgO substrate.

Fig. 10a,b illustrates measured data processing. It is seen note a very good agreement of simulations with measurements, especially in the Re/Im notation. Table II summarizes derived results with optimization procedure applied.

In the paraelectric film (used for tuned devices) microwave loss is much lower than that in the ferroelectric one, and microwave absorption of paraelectric is derived from the damping of soft lattice vibration mode as well from polar phase fluctuations above the Curie point (polar clusters).

Partial filling of the waveguide section by a specimen is considered, so the proposed technique can be adapted to a small specimen study if big one is not available.

One of important application of waveguide partial filling is ferroelectric thin film study by the electrode-less technique.

Proposed microwave method of film investigation does not require electrodes deposition, so film dielectric constant (??) and film loss (??) can be obtained and compared at various stages of film processing.

Microwave data are very sensitive to ferroelectric film properties because this film shows dielectric dispersion of ?* conditioned by the domain wall vibrations just at microwaves.

It means that domain switching possibility is tied with microwave ?' and ?". Namely, while film processing, the  appearance of capable for switching ferroelectric domains corresponds to the microwave loss ?"  maximum.



V. RESONANT METHODS FOR FILM STUDY Nowadays technologies gradually go to deposit very thin  films. At this, film permittivity decreases. Both causes make microwave metering more difficult: film ? = 500 and thickness t = 1?m change signal phase as substrate with ? = 50 and t = 500?m. Ordinary now film with ? = 100 and t = 0.1?m on the same substrate changes transparent microwave signal phase 50 times less than a substrate. Therefore, the thinner film, the less sensitivity will be for the non-resonant methods.

That is why we proposed and studied two resonant methods to investigate ferroelectric films in a waveguide.

In first resonant method film on substrate was inserted into thin longitudinal slot in the wide wall of rectangular waveguide [15]. Using Network Analyser, a resonance of partially fold part of waveguide was studied and analysed [16].

The quality factor and resonant frequency were used to calculate film loss and ?, Fig. 7. Films Ba0.9Sr0.1TiO3 are obtained by a sol-gel route. Annealing strongly influence on film parameters.

The second resonant method uses the substrate (where film  is deposited) as a thin dielectric resonator (DR). As it was mentioned, if film becomes less thick, and the influence of film presence on a substrate turns out to be less impressive to the electrodynamic parameters for the system ?film on substrate?, Fig. 9.

MRRS-2008 Symposium Proceedings. Kiev, Ukraine, September 22-24, 2008   However, in the case of thin DR use two effects can increase method sensitivity. First of all, the resonance of free substrate (without film) is a very high quality, because as a substrate very low loss dielectric is used (such as sapphire or magnesium oxide with tan? < 10-4). Secondly, substrate should be relatively thin (might be 50?200?m) to increase film influence to resonant frequency ?0 and quality factor Q.

Fig. 10.  Several resonances are exited for thin inclined DR; used for thin DR measurements TE01? mode is higher than ?parasite? HE111 mode. Mixed modes HEM cannot be used for ? calculations.

Resonance with film is compared with resonance of empty  substrate, and from the frequency change ?? the film ? is extracted while film loss is obtained from the change in Q.

The problem need to be overcome is unusually very thin and low ? DR study. Many resonant modes appear in this system but the TE01? has to be used for ? and loss calculations.

Problem of modes separation was solved as by calculation so by the experiments, Fig.10. In thinner substrate frequency resolution of modes becomes better. Different oblique angle DR arrangement in a waveguide was studied as well.



VI. CONCLUSIONS The goal of the report is to compare different methods of  ferroelectric bulk and film materials microwave study in order to select appropriate method for any concrete situation of investigation.

Presented research improves common techniques of  ferroelectric and related dielectric materials microwave examination in such a way that makes it possible to measure both high dielectric constant and loss.
