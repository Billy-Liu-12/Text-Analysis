Abstract?A dosimeter-on-a-chip (DoseChip) comprised of a tissue-equivalent scintillator coupled to a solid-state photomultiplier (SSPM) built using CMOS technology represents an ideal technology for a space-worthy, real-time solar-particle monitor for astronauts. It provides a tissue- equivalent response to the relevant energies and types of radiation for low-Earth orbit and interplanetary space flight to the moon or Mars.  The DoseChip will complement the existing Crew Passive Dosimeters by providing real-time dosimetry and as an alarming monitor for solar particle events (SPEs).
