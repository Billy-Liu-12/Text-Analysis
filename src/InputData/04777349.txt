Mining Weighted Negative Association Rules Based on Correlation from  Infrequent Items

Abstract   The every item is set a weight because there is  different importance between items. Negative association rules become a focus in the field of data mining. Negative association rules are useful in market-basket analysis to identify products that conflict with each other or products that complement each other. The negative association rules often consist in the infrequent items. The negative rules mining is associated with weight, an algorithm is proposed to resolve the above problem in this paper.  The experiment proves that the number of the negative association rules from the infrequent items is larger than those from the frequent.

1. Introduction   Association rule mining, as an important problem in data mining, was originally proposed in [1]. Much effort has been devoted and algorithms proposed for efficiently discovering association rules [2,3,4].All the items in a database are treated in a uniform in the traditional Algorithm Apriori. However, it is not true in the real world databases, in which different items usually have different importance. The model of weighted association rule and corresponding algorithm are proposed by C. H. Cai et al.[5]. For association rules of the form A?B, whose weighted support (ws) and weighted confidence (wc) meet a weighted minimum support (wms) threshold and a weighted minimum confidence (wmc) respectively in the famous support-confidence framework. An efficient mining method for Weighted Association Rules (WARs) is put forward [6].

All the traditional association rule mining algorithms were developed to find positive associations between items. By positive associations we refer to associations between items existing in transactions (i.e.

items bought). What about associations of the type: ?customers that buy Coke do not buy Pepsi? or ?customers that buy juice do not buy bottled water??

Recently, mining association rules has received some attention and is proved to be useful. But little study is about negative association rules (NARs), especially weighted negative association rules (WNARs). The rules of the form A??B, which suggests that a customer may not buy item B after the customer buys item A, together with the rules of the forms ?A?B and ?A??B, are called negative association rules and the rules of the form A?B positive association rules (PARs).Recently, the problem of identifying negative associations (or ?dissociations?), addressing also the absence of itemsets, has been explored and considered relevant [7][8]. In [9] A.Savasere et al. propose strong negative association rules. In [10] X.J. Dong et al.

propose correlation method to solve these questions.

The negative rules are mined form frequent itemsets in the above algorithms.

The algorithms of mining negative weighted rules from the frequent itemsets are designed in our previous work. The weight is associated with the items according to the users? concern or the profit of the product. An algorithm PNWAR based on the correlation of itemsets is proposed in [11]. The interestingness measure is added to the support- confidence framework to delete the contrary rules in [12]. A model of multiple-support is put forward because the frequencies of items are different in [13].

The above algorithm are based on frequent itemsets, the results can?t satisfy our demand.

DOI 10.1109/ICACC.2009.123    DOI 10.1109/ICACC.2009.123     The negative rules are from infrequent itemsets more usually. There are several problems when mining negative rules from the infrequent itemsets. First of all, in typical supermarket transaction databases, there are thousands of items (wares) and each record (customer transaction)only contains a few of them. For a database containing 10,000 items, such that each customer on average buys 10 of them, the density of the database is 0.1%.From the perspective of negative patterns (indicating absence of items), the density is a soaring 99.9%, leading to explosive amounts of, mostly uninteresting, rules. Secondly, the complexity of AR mining algorithms is exponential in the number of items; if for each item from the database a corresponding negated item(indicating absence of the original item)is considered, the computational costs will skyrocket. As a consequence, the way a valid negative association rule is defined plays an important role. Finally, as we will point out further on, the introduction of negative association rules invalidates some important pruning aids used to restrict the search space and guarantee efficiency in classical algorithms.

An algorithm WNRIF is put forward to mine the weighted negative rules from infrequent itemsets.

Generate infrequent itemsets according to the nature of negative rules. The traction database is scanned only once generating infrequent itemsets in the algorithm.

The efficiency of generating is improved and the space of search is shortened. The number of mined negative rules is much larger than from the frequent itemsets. It proves that the algorithm is effective.

2. Problem statement and related work  2.1. Weighted Association Rules   Weighted Association Rules is as follows: there are n records and m items. Let I ={i1,i2,....,im}be a set of items and W={w1, w2,?, wm}(wi [0,1]?be a set of non-negative real numbers. A pair(X, w(X)) is called a weighted item where X I is an item and w(X) W is the weight associated with X. A transaction is a set of weighted items, each of which may appear in multiple transactions with different weights. A dataset may therefore be defined as a set D of transactions.

Given a weighted itemset X and a set of transactions, referred to as D, we say X has support in D if s% of transactions in D support X. The weighted support of an itemset X in a dataset D, denoted as wsup(X)= countD(X)/|D|*w(X), where countD(X) is the number of transactions in D containing X. Note that the support of a weighted itemset X is always less than or equal to the support of any of its generalization.

There are several different formulations for the weighted support of the rule X?Y according to the different demand, where X?I, Y?I, and X?Y=?. The left-hand side(LHS)of the rule is called the antecedent, while the right-hand side(RHS)is called the consequence. In this paper the following form is used:  sup(X?Y)= countD(X?Y)/|D| wsup(X?Y) = avg{ w1, w2,?, wp } * sup(X?Y) where p is the items? count of the itemset X, avg{  w1, w2,?, wp } is the average value of the weight of itemset X?Y and sup(X?Y) is support of itemset X?Y before the item is associated with weight.

An itemset is said to be weighted-frequent (large) if its support is larger than a user-specified value (also called minimum weighted support (wminsup)).

The confidence of the WAR denoted as conf is the ratio of the weighted support of X ? Y over the weighted support of X. The weighted support of X?Y (wsup) in the transactions is larger than wminsup, furthermore when X appears in a transaction, Y is likely to appear in the same transaction with a probability conf. X?Y is a valid rule if its weighted support wsup(X?Y) and weighted confidence wconf(A?B) meet minimum weighted support (wminsup) and minimum weighted confidence (wminconf).

2.2. Calculate Support and Confidence of Weighted Negative Association Rules    There are very few papers to discuss and discover negative association rules. Brin et.al[14]mentioned for the first time in the literature the notion of negative relationships. In [15], each positive rule X?Y correspond three negative ones, X??Y, ?X?Y and ?X??Y. A transaction t supports X??Y if X ?t and Y?t.

Mining negative association rules, however, raises a number of critical issues. The number of infrequent itemsets increases by exponential, so the search space of the negative association rules is large than the positive. Therefore, the support and confidence of the negative association rules is difficult and disinteresting directly. For instance, if the number of the frequent itemsets is 250, the number of the infrequent ones is (21000-250) approximately 21000. So support and confidence of the negative ARs can be straightforwardly deduced from the corresponding positive itemsets? supports. In fact, the support and confidence of negative association rule associated with weight are transformed to the following forms to be calculated [10]:  Calculate weighted support of WARs (1)wsup(?A) = 1-wsup(A);     (2)wsup(A ? ?B) = wsup(A)-wsup(A ? B); (3)wsup(?A ? B) = wsup(B)- wsup(A ? B); (4)wsup(?A ? ?B)=1-wsup(A)-wsup(B) + wsup(A ? B); Calculate weighted confidence of WARS:  (5)wconf(A??B) =  ( ) ( ) ( )  w s u p A - w s u p A B w s u p A  ?   =1- wconf (A?B); (6)wconf(?A?B)  = ( ) -  ( ) 1 - ( )  w s u p B w s u p A B w s u p A  ?  ; (7) wconf (?A??B)  = ( ) ( ) ( ) )  ( ) 1 - w s u p A - w s u p B  +  w s u p A B  1 - w s u p A ?   =1- wconf (?A?B) ?.

2.3 correlation   Many uninteresting even self-contrary rules may be  produced when both positive and negative association rules are mined simultaneous. The correlation is used to delete the contrary rules. The measure correlation is calculated by the following form :  Corr(A,B)=  ( ) ( ) ( )  w su p A B w su p A w su p B  ?  [11].

3. Mining the Negative Rules from Infrequent Itemset  3.1 Mining Infrequent Itemset   In the support-confidence framework, if s(A) ?wms, then A is a frequent itemset; and if s(A) < wms, then A is an infrequent itemset.

Because the weight is associated with item, the  downward closed property is no longer in point.  If the number of the frequent itemsets is 250, the number of the infrequent ones is (21000-250) approximately 21000.

Therefore, the method of pruning need considering again  According to the formula of negative association rules, the infrequent itemsets are divided into the following parts:  (a) The itemsets whose support is less than the minimum weighted support in discovering the frequent itemsets.

(b) The LHS of them is from the subset of a traction record, the RHS of them is from the subset of non- existing in a traction record.

(c) Subset of non-existing items of every traction record.

3.2 Algorithm Design   The generating of frequent itemsets and association rules are the same as [11]. The set of items in database is denoted as A.

Algorithm WNRIF Input: TD: Transaction Database; Output: PAR: set of positive associate rule; NAR:  set of negative associate rule; STEP: (1) FIS=?; inFIS=?; (2) Generate frequent itemset FIS.

(3) Scan database T.

(3.1)for each transaction t?TD do generate infrequent itemsets infi=(LHS,RHS) like  (b); if (FIS don?t contains infi) inFIS.add(infi); generate infrequent itemsets infi00 like  (c);//////////////infi00=subset(A-t); if (FIS don?t contains infi00 and inFIS don?t  contains infi00) inFIS.add(infi00); (3.2) if ws(infi_i in inFIS)<wms inFIS.remove(); (4) Generate negative rules.

4. Experiment result   We conducted our experiments on a man-made dataset to study the behavior of the algorithms compared. The dataset had 200 transactions, when only the six largest categories were kept. Compared an algorithm WNRIF with traditional Algorithm PNWAR, the number of negative rules mined from the two algorithm is different.

Experiment one:  The weighted minimum support (wms) is equal, but the weighted minimum confidence is set different values. wms=3%.

Table 1.The number of NRs on the condition of the same wms  wmc 50% 60% 70% 80% PNWAR 214 199 194 175 WPNIF 354 335 330 306 Experiment two: The weighted minimum confidence (wmc) is equal, but the weighted minimum support is set different values.

wmc=40%.

Table 2.The number of NRs on the condition of the same wmc  wms 3% 5% 7% PNWAR 214 76 36 WPNIF 354 104 90     The results show that the number of negative rules in PNWAR was less than in the WNRIF on the condition of the same wms or wmc.

5. Conclusion   Negative AR mining is a highly relevant, yet difficult problem in data mining which recently has caught many researchers? interest. Discovering the infrequent itemsets is important for the negative rules.

This paper proposed an algorithm WNRIF the database is scanned only once in mining the negative rules in the algorithm. the experiment results shows that the negative rules from infrequent itemsets is more than from the frequent. The algorithm is efficient.
