Keywords- Data Mining? Association Rules? FP-Growth Algorithm? Tongue Diagnosis Of TCM

I.  INTRODUCTION The tongue of TCM is a synthetically diagnose  method. It is that medical treatment synthetically diagnosing method of TCM about the disease giving first place to tongue (the tongue disease is the symptom information drawing from the patient's tongue image), considering pulse condition and other clinical data.

Everyone case may be confessed to analyze usage in the future by deposition to clinical case data base after accomplishing a diagnose. Foreseeing, as time goes, the clinical case database accumulates continuously. We should may gain diagnose regulation or diagnose experience from large amount of case data. That in fact, the diagnosis regulation of TCM is the large amount of clinical case summary.

Tongue image and pulse condition of TCM, besides other location symptom, the symptom being able to be the reference is very much in fact, and very trivial. How to extract main part being related to the disease in so many symptoms? By integrating diagnosis thought of TCM , image processing and data mining technology, considering some main symptoms and the body symbol, linking the disease relations with patient's age , occupation , house , season etc., the article discovered  "symptom ->disease " regulation not having been found or joined not to have taken seriously by  predecessor. Let a doctor can diagnose patient's disease coming the information from an another angle.



II. TYPE STYLE AND FONTS Association rule is one kind of important knowledge  pattern in data base. Agrawal and others[1]- [7] presented the  association rule theory  and the support degree ? confidence degree models .

A. Support Degree The support degree that the document among [8] had  defined has a deviation as magnanimity , the frequencies having thought that project collection X appears in business only, have ignored but project collection Y turn up frequencies. That project collection Y being one of two marriage partner of relevance couplet is ignored, evidently is improper.

The correlation analysing whose cause , Agrawal and others has set a limit for the relation being connected to be a weak causal relationship seemingly factitiously in the concept: That the project gathers the X creation is the cause that the project gathers Y produces , thinking that having seized cause being able to, therefore gather Y being able to ignore a project. The association relation in fact, may be a weak causal relationship but , also may be not this relation. The association relation can only be to be that a kind of may coexist for sure or certain on being not that mutual exclusion concerns a basis gets in touch with kind.

Being one kind of what relation after all is not the focal point paying close attention to in fact , the both sides being that this is connected with existence finds key , should associative both sides equity be treated therefore.

Therefore, to support degree, definition work is amended as follows.

Define 1: Set up I = { I1 , I2, ?,Im } is the aggregation that the be unlike project is composed of from m, a given affair data base D, every affair T among of them is a group of the project aggregation , X and Y are part of project aggregation , are T I, X I, Y I, X??, Y??, X ?Y??, TX indicates that the affair containing project collection X assembles, TY indicates that the affair containing project collection Y assembles, TX ? TY expresses TX and the TY union, X <=> Y indicates that the equity association relation of the project collection X and project collection Y, whose support degree is then:  support (X<?>Y)= P(TX?TY)                      (1) ?P(TX)= P(X) ?P(TX) = P(Y)?P(TX?TY) = P(X?Y) ?     P(TX?TY) = P(X)+ P(Y)- P(X?Y) So ? support (X<?>Y)= P(X)+ P(Y)- P(X?Y)       (2)  B. Confidence Degree In the association rule theory being connected Agrawal  and others, project collection X and project collection Y look upon relevance couplet as an antecedent leading to   DOI 10.1109/ESIAT.2009.454    DOI 10.1109/ESIAT.2009.454    DOI 10.1109/ESIAT.2009.454     the consequent turn up , Confidence degree has had a shortcoming as magnanimity , which has considered the relation of X and X?Y, has ignored but P (Y). Confidence degree has different value to regulation X => Y and Y => X being connected , this is not very proper.

Relation being connected for more accurate magnanimity, confidence degree does if giving a definition:  Define 2: Set up I = { I1 , I2, ?, Im } is the aggregation that the be unlike project is composed of from m, a given affair data base D, among them every affair T is a group of the project aggregation , X and Y are part project aggregation , are T I?X I?Y I?X???Y?? ?X ?Y???T X indicates that the affair containing project collection X assembles , TY indicates that the affair containing project collection Y assembles , TX ? TY expresses TX and the TY union, TX ?TY expresses TX and the TY intersection set , the equity correlation indicating that the project gathers X and project collection Y concerns X <=> Y , whose confidence degree  is then:  conf (X<?>Y) = P(TX?TY)/ P(TX?TY)                    (5) conf (X<?>Y) = P(X?Y) /( P(X)+ P(Y)- P(X?Y))    (6) The association relation has strong or weak that mark,  strong or weak describing the association relation's for the quantify , concept , definition bringing forward the intensity being connected as follows:  Define 3: The project incorporates the probability that X and the project collection Y relevance unite and project collection X and project collection Y are not that associative probability ratio is called the association intensity.

When  P (TX ?TY) ?P (TX ?TY) , Con-strength (X <=> Y)  = P (TX ?TY)/ (P (TX ?TY) -P (TX ?TY) )            (7) that's it: Con-strength (X <=> Y)  = P (X?Y)/ (P (X) + P (Y) -2?P(X?Y))                 (8) When  P (TX ?TY) = P (TX ?TY) ,  Con-strength (X <=> Y) = + ?.

Intensity value region being connected is [0, + ?).

Con-strength (X <=> Y) = 0 is called there being no correlation; 0 <Con-strength (X <=> Y) ?1 is called weak correlation, Con-strength (X <=> Y)>1 is called being connected by force.



III. IMPROVED FP-GROWTH ALGORITHM  A. The analysis of database of TCM  When analyze the cases of TCM diagnosis system, the  rules of traditional Chinese medicine experts are interested in is: Which Syndrome can be combined with the patient's basic information to infer what disease the patient had.

That is to say, the association rules excavated in the system have only the following forms:  age + profession + symptom (a) + symptom (b) +? + symptom (z)=?disease(k) .

In the right of the rules, we care about Syndrome only one field, while in the left of the rules,  we are only concerned about the symptoms field. In this case, the different fields of one record in the database have an unequal status in the rules. If we use the existing  association rule mining methods to carry out excavation, we will tap into shape, such as?  Symptom(a) + symptom(b) = ? syndrome(c) + age(age).

Such rules are not what we need.

converting the age, occupation and place of origin into the same dimension with the symptoms, we can use clustering and mining multilevel association rules thinking.

To analyze the disease database of TCM, it was found that the data can be parted a few blocks. So the disease database should be divided into sub- database, and mining diagnosis rules become easy and fine.

B. Improving the FP-growth Algorithm In the algorithm, apart from the confidence degree and  support degree, it also introduced a third threshold: the smallest number of mining cases. If and only if when the number of cases in the database, which leads to a disease, over this value, we should carry out excavation on this.

Otherwise, we believe that the card is only an isolated example of the syndrome, and does not have a general meaning. We do not mine it. In the following, we show the significance of the three threshold in the system.

Support degree: the support level of this system is to be aimed at a particular syndrome. Its significance is: In a particular syndrome of all cases records, they include proportion that the number of cases about one symptom item-sets accounts for in the all cases.

Confidence degree: the confidence level of this system is to be aimed at the whole database, and is a conditional probability. Its significance is the proportion of the number of cases including one symptom item-sets and accounts of cases including that symptom item-sets in data base.

The smallest number of mining cases: Only when a kind of cases of syndromes for more than this number, the system will be digging it. If the cases are few, chance is too high, and the rules mined out have little meaning.

The confidence degree and support degree was calculated on a sub-database, it was more precise.



IV. EXPERIMENTS AND THE RESULTS OF COMPARISON AND ANALYSIS  Mining frequent pattern is carried out the same syndrome cases. The mining of associational rules has three steps: Data Pretreatment, Find frequent item-sets, Calculate the support, confidence and relevance of intensity of associated frequent item-sets, Extract strong relationship (namely, access to knowledge).

After being improved in this article, the FP-growth algorithm is applied to find frequent item-sets. After modify the threshold of association rules` mining, come to the main-process stream of the algorithm. It is as follows: ? Program begin? ? Enter the minimum support degree, confidence degree  and start digging data ? ? Read all cases recorded  from the database; ? Construct FP-Tree(T)? ? Read all List of Syndromes  from the database? ?Have all syndromes been  traversed?  No ?turn?? ? Yes, Build chain of association rules ARLink, Output  ARLink,  Program over?     ? Read all cases recorded about next syndrome from the database?  ? For the cases set S of syndrome X , construct FP- Tree(S)?  ? Mine FP-Tree(S)?Gain  the frequent pattern chain PtnLink of FP-Tree?  ? Has PtnLink been  traversed? Yes, turn ?? ? NO, calculate FqtPtn confidence degree of next  frequent pattern? ?Does it meet minimal threshold of confidence degree  ?No, turn ?? ? Yes, add FqtPtn to the chain of association rules; Turn  ?.

In the Data Mining System about tongue diagnosis  intelligent reasoning of TCM, respectively,  use  the classic Apriori algorithm and improved FP-growth algorithm researched in this article to search frequent item-sets.

Here are the results of the comparison about Apriori algorithm and the improved FP-growth algorithm, in the case of that the  record number = 100, the number of minimum support is different :  TABLE I.  THE RESULTS OF TWO ALGORITHMS  support number  The number of frequent item-sets received  Mining Time  Apriori algorithm  improved FP-growth algorithm  Apriori algorithm  improved FP-growth algorithm  2 992 992 3.442563 0.862766 5 70 70 1.324436 0.728562 8 17 17 1.072998 0.723945 10 8 8 0.938859 0.670949  After comparing, we can see one thing. To obtain the same results in the case of a given same conditions, improved FP-growth algorithm loss time less than Apriori algorithm. With the increase in the number of minimum support, the difference loss of time between two algorithms is getting smaller and smaller.



V. CONCLSION In this paper, we analyzed the method of extracting diagnosis experience based on multi-dimensional  association rules in tongue diagnosis system of TCM. In the basis of research results in the integrated application of data mining, pattern recognition and symptom information to quantify of TCM, etc, we have studied an improved FP-growth algorithm. Starting from authenticity and usefulness of knowledge needed to acquire? we put forward a new measurement method of association rules.

In addition to a more comprehensive manner taking into account the patient's clinical manifestations, we consider the relationship between the syndrome and other things, such as the patient's age, profession, living areas , seasons, and so on. It makes algorithm extract diagnostic rules hidden in the data of a large number of cases. It gives a detailed description of the algorithm, realizes the algorithm process, and successfully applied to diagnosis rules mining in case database of tongue diagnosis of TCM. Test results show that the algorithm is fast, strong adaptability. The algorithm researched in this article can also be applied to fault diagnosis and intelligent search.
