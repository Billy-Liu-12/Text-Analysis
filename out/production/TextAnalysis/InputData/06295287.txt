I. INTRODUCTION Web access information mining makes use of the principle  of the data mining to mine the data which is recorded in the server when the users visit the web. It not only mines the related data sources, but also the semi-structured data sources or non-structured isomerous data sources.The current Web access information mining has become a new research hotspot, focusing on system improvements, the modeling of the users, the findings of navigation mode, the efficiency improvements of Web site, real-time and humanistic recommendations, commercial intelligent discoveries and so on. Electronic Commercial Mining is only limited to the time when purchased, but can not monitor the subconscious desire to buy.

How to Integrate and extract the corresponding data from Web isomerous data sources, analyze the information the users visit, mine the customers? potential purchase intention and transform the data of customers into commercial value is still the hot issue of many e-commerce enterprises to solve[1].

This paper takes a B2C e-commerce website in some city as the research background puts forward an application model based on the information integration and data mining on the web access in the view of practical application and validate the application effects of the mining model by the experiment.



II. USER ACCESS INFORMATION MINING BASED ON WEB MODEL  The current electronic commerce website access information to relation data, xml, html and other types, this  paper studied the design of a Web based access information mining model. The basic idea of the design of the model, the Web access information of the new features, the use of xml language can be cross-platform, Web semi structured access information obviously, and loose coupling structure characteristic and data mining thought principle, firstly the Web heterogeneous relational data, html document is converted to xml documents, and with the Web on the existing xml document integration, using xml as intermediate data model shield Web access information heterogeneity, then followed by screening into relation data, and then improve the traditional data mining methods, extended to electronic commerce, deep analysis of web access information, obtaining user access to valuable information[2].

Base on the mining process of this application model, the XML document of Web usage can be put into XML database for the coming processing; then straightly put the XML document exchanged from the HTML document into the XML database; relational data should be dealt according to the particular types of user?s relational database management system (RDBMS), that is, the isomorphic relational data should be put into relational database, whilst the isomerous relational data should be put into the XML database only after it exchanged to XML document; finally, exchange the XML data to the relational data through XML-RDB and save it into the relational database. Next stage, the queries will be conducted in the relational database by data query and extraction model, and the data miner arithmetic model will be adopted for extracting and mining data[3].



III. THE REALIZATION OF THE KEY TECHNIQUES FOR WEB USAGE MINING  It is a complicated systematical project for the Web usage mining technique realization, due to the project is relevant to many cognitive and technological issues. In the following content, there comes discussion about the realization of some key techniques.

Computer Science & Education (ICCSE 2012) July 14-17, 2012. Melbourne, Australia   ThD3.6      A.  The technique of HTML to XML exchange OEM data model can be utilized for exchanging HTML  document to XML document. Firstly, convert HTML document to tree-structured code, then exchange it to XML document by using the algorithm of mapping. The main procedures are: 1) extract the object information according to the description of HTML document; 2) analyze the content of HTML, confirm the property and the relations between semantic information, and form a complete data model; 3) highlight all the document marks of XML, make sure the mapping relations between XML document and HTML document, generate XML document according to these mapping relations throughout the HTML document list.

B. The technique of XML-RDB exchange model The traditional method of relational data mining has  disadvantage, such as the Apriori Algorithm cannot be straightly applied to the data mining XML document, but only after the DTD model of XML or XML Schema model mapped to relational database model. Due to the RDBMS does not emphasize on the format but the data, the ordinary mapping method only keeps information on data level, whilst the format of XML document would be lost during the exchange process.

Therefore, inspired from the three tables mapping application mode, the author in this research of data mining model design decides to exchange the format information in Web and the XML data without format information to 3 relational tables (path table, edge table, data table), then save them into relational database in order to achieve the exchange between XML format and relational table of Web data.

C. The technique of RDB-XML exchange model Relational data is complete structured data with simple  structure. It can generate information drawing with different semantics, and express in XML document data format fluently.

Relational data, however, cannot express semantics directly; instead, its definition depends on the restriction of the data integrity. Hence, the key of exchange is to exchange the data collection which bases on tables and indexes to structural XML data with rich semantic information. It can be understood as to exchange pre-defined content of view to XML format. The technological realization of the exchange between relational mode and XML mode is able to set branches through deep- traversal-transform-algorithm, so that to create the DOM tree of the entire XML document.

D. The realization of the data miner arithmetic model The data miner arithmetic includes Association Rule  Mining, Path Analysis, Cluster Analysis, and Decision-making Tree Analysis. Web accessing information which is saved in relational database format via these exchange process is able to be analyzed by data miner arithmetic. Association Rule Mining Arithmetic adopts the improved FP-growth mining arithmetic so that achieves the relational rule mining to the accessing data and dynamic update.

The suggestion of FP-growth relational miner arithmetic pointed out by Han et al is an optimization of the classic Apriori arithmetic. FP-growth algorithm adopts pattern fragment growth method and only scans database twice, which is considered as significantly improved from Apriori  arithmetic; on the other side, the drawback of it can be its low efficiency on update and dynamic maintenance relational rule.

The optimized FP-growth arithmetic is: during the first scan compress the frequency set of the database into an FP-tree, meantime keep its relational information; then differentiate the FP-tree to some conditional affair database related to some frequency set with length of L, and conduct relational rules mining to the affair database; when conduct the relational rules mining process to the altered database, differentiate the long affair to a set of continuous semantics according to time, utilize updated affair and previous mining result, and adopt FP-growth arithmetic to generate frequency set for the local process in order to update the rules.



IV. MINING AND DISCOVERING BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE There are four steps in mining process of Web data. First  step is identifying business objects; second step is data preprocessing; algorithm of data mining is the third step and then output the results. The application of information on Web interview to find the interested things of users based on data mining association is studied in this paper. Network enterprise usually requires what is customer needs and update the page on time based on the demand to meet the needs of the customers.

When users visit the page, usually find the interested webpage on key words, thus the associated data researched by some mining analysis can be monitored and abstracted the potential demand.

Association rules of interest are the relationships among users? visit usually. The rules of mining in interest relation is one kind of finding in low space dimensions and the relationships between pages and files visited by users. There no direct relationships between page and files while association rules can find the inner connection. When mining the useful data the information of visited by users on Web should be exchanged the data with some relationship and then extracting data based on some regular pattern. This paper studies on the optimized FP-growth algorithm to promote to mining experiment.

In this paper, VC++6.0 is chosen as experimental compiler and SQLServe2000 as the database management system. We select client access log file data on one electronic commerce website. The data should be pre-processed and extract 900 business records, which are used to construct a FP tree by FP- growth and then the relation rule should be mined on frequent page set by FP- tree. Table 1 shows the maximum frequent page with minimum support are respectively 1%, 2%, 5% .

TABLE I.  THE MAXIMAL FREQUENT PAGE SET  Recordcount Min_sup=1% Min_sup=2% Min_sup=5%   {a1,b2,b3,b4,b5}  {a1,b4,b5,c5}  {a1,b2,b7,c6,c7}  {a1,b4,b5}  {a1,b6,c6,c7}  {a1,b4}  {a1,b6,c7}     ThD3.6      In Table 1, a1 b2 b3 b4 b5 b6 b7 c5 c6 c7 follow as home page, all goods, Gift Center, special, books, jewelry, music, video, cosmetics, sales chart respectively on the electronic commerce website. From table 1 can understand the site in which users are the most frequently accessed page set.

For the frequent item sets above, extract association rules under certain confidence and support level. For example, with support for 5% the three frequent set {a1 b6 c7} F and there will are all nonempty set of F. For each of the nonempty set S, if support_count ( F ) / support_count ( S ) ) > = min_conf, then the output rules are" S = > F-S ", in which min_conf is the minimum confidence threshold. When the confidence level is 80% the output rules will be a1 b6 c7, which mean 5% of the people to visit the site home page and stores, and at the same time 80% people visit the bestseller in visiting the website home page and cosmetics page in the 900 records. Limited the Length paper, the extracted rules will not list one by one.



V. CLOSING REMARKS Web access information is large data information.It is  various and updating,and remember the visitors,the visited web,the visiting time and so on.Some meaningful data are  applied in the electronic commerce environment according to mining algorithm.And get valuable commercial intelligence information about electronic business operation manage.Such as identifying the user?s speciality and forecasting the interest of potential customers by remembering the web visitors?information.It explores the visiting data in the particular period.At last it finds the commonality of colony visiting? behaviors and the potenctial customers?information.So then update the web structure,offer some relational base for the strategis of web electronic business operator.
