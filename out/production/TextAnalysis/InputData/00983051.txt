Associafion Rule Mining and its application in posfal

ABSTRACT  Several algorithms in data mining technique were studied recently, among which association was one of the most important ones. In this paper, we introduce theory of association rule in data mining, and analyze the characteristics of postal EMS service. We create a data warehouse model for EMS services and give the procedure of applying association rule mining based on it. In the end, we give an example of the whole mining procedure. This EMS- Data warehouse model and association rule mining technique have been applied in a practical Postal CRM System.

INTRODUCTION  With the rapid development of information technology, a new problem raised "we are flood of data, but starve of knowledge". And this leads to the data mining technology.

Data Mining is to extract the hidden information, pattern or knowledge that is very useful but not known before, from huge practical data that is not complete, noisy, random and fuzzy.

Association rule mining is an important part of data mining. By analyzing the relativity of the values of data stored in the database, we can discover hidden association patterns. The classical example of "Beer-diaper" is a case of association rule mining.

When NCR, a leading company in data mining, analyzed the saled products in Wal-Mart that was the largest supermarket company in the world, they found that there is a high association between beer and diaper. The result of deeper analysis showed that young father always buy beer when they buy diaper for their babies, too. Therefore, Wal-mart put beer and diaper together, and improved the sale of the products.

The method of Association Rule was raised by RAgrawal in 1993. It can show the relativity of different products by generating Frequency item set. In the process of generating Frequency item set, the terms of minimum Support and minimum Confidence are used. Let's take the transaction database in a supermarket as an example of Association rule:  I={il, i2, is,. . . ,im} is an Item set. It represents the aggregation of different products in the supermarket. D={tl, tz ,  t3,..., tn) is a transaction set. It represents the aggregation of each transaction. Association rule is an expression as follows:  PI A PZ A P ~ A -  - A P n+ ql q2A q3A - - A q m  0-7803-70 I0-4/0 I /$-TOTEE  http://duanvunfenc18263.net   IPIiPZ, P3, * - -IPJ C I J I ~ I J  92,93, * *I  I?

{ply p2, p3,, . . ,pni n iqlJ 9~~93, .  . . , qrni=@  The left part of the expression is {PlJPzJP3,. . . J P d ,  the Item Set is defined as B; The  They are subset of original Item Set /, G=B U H, it represents the Item set that  Confidence: C= I G ~  / IBI right part of the expression is {91J92,q3,. . .,qrn],the Item Set is defined as H.

supports both B and H. Then we have the definition:  support  Given a transaction set D, the problem that has to solve is to generate the association rules that has a Support and Confidence more than those set by the users (minimum support and minim um confidence).

2. THE ANALYSE OF EMS SERVICE  EMS service is an example of logistics system: its goal is to delivery product between users on time. A large amount of data are accumulated by the existing EMS service system, but few data are used or mined. The only way we deal with these data now is just collecting. On the other hand, these data can tell us more information, not only the behavior characters of the customer, but also the relationship between the different category of services, and so on.

If we analyze the data in a deeper level, with the data mining techniques, we can raise the credibility of making decision. More new convenient and profitable EMS services can be supported to the customers.

With the investigation of a postal office in a province, we find that EMS services can be divided into following catalogs: 1. EMS service in the same city  1. Pupil delivery: to take the pupil to their home after class and to school before class.

2. Flower express: to send the flower to his friend for the customer.

3. Cake express: to deliver a birthday cake for a customer.

4. Ticket (TraWAircraft) express: to buy and send the ticket to the customer once they  want.

5. Patient delivery: to take the patient to the hospital to see a doctor.

6. Gifts express: to deliver a gift for a customer.

1. Wedding series service: to prepare a band, and waiter for the wedding ceremony.

2. Business Opening celebration service: to prepare a ceremony when a new company  start business.

3. Celebration of employee?s birthday: to send a birthday cake to a employee of a  company in his birthday.

4. Congratulation an elder on his birthday: to prepare a ceremony for an elder birthday.

3. Mail delivery: Delivery a mail using EMS transport network within a limited time.

4. Propagandist agent: While delivering mails, also act as a propagandist agent, to send  advertisement product to the customer.

5. Direct sales and so on.

We can find that there are many kinds of different services in the EMS system. Many operational data in these services that discussed above were recorded in the database. In a certain services, the customer?s name, the identification card ID, the address, and the data alike are recorded after each transaction. These data are gold only if after being mined.

There are a lot of patterns in data mining, such as classification pattern, clustering pattern, deviation pattern, association pattern, and so on. Here we take the association pattern mining as an example to show the process of data mining.

We are going to find the association rule between the different services based on the service  2. Celebration service:     data showed above. If two services are associated, when a customer ask one service from the EMS system, the EMS system can try to sale the associated service. This is an example of ?Cross-sale?.

3. THE APPLICATION OF ASSOCIATION RULE MINING  Before we can find the association rule, we need build up a data warehouse system. In the data warehouse, several fields that represent the service?s content were added into a fact table, to analyze the relativity of different services. The fact table is a sign of the data warehouse, and it is the raw source data for the data mining.

The fact table, as shown in Figure 1, is a more detail table that can show the transaction records of different users in different time. It is different with the different service operational database, here we need the data clean and data integrate process to prepare the data in a uniform architecture.

Customer-Dimension Q CustomerID  IDNum  Center-Dimension Q, CenterlD  CenterNO AreaNo  Time-Dimension I Recordtime c  Year I  I  Fact-EMS Table  @& ServiceTypeID(?Q @ Recordtime (FE3  Responsetime && Unittypeid  Address  -  _ _  Fax 1 Tel  - I I I  t i  b - -  t - I I  bliver-area-Dimension t& DliverID c  I Province City County Service-Dimension  Servicekscription  CeliverFlag I I 1 I yy,  _ - Level3 ~ - - - - - - -  Fiaure 1 -- the fact table of EMS service data warehouse The fact table shows that each record is a detail order of EMS transaction. But in  association analysis, we have to know the service types that a customer used. So, transform is needed. First, we use the CustomerlD in fact table to integrate all the services that a certain customer used, the result will be:  Referring to the field ServicetypelD in the fact table, we get the service type of each ti.

According to our purpose (association analysis), we just record the service once if a service exists in the result more than once. Now we get the record of the services used by each customer. We call it transaction data set, which is the set of Ti. F is the target data source of the association rule mining.

In the procedure of Association rule mining, we employ Apriori Algorithm to analyze the transaction data set F. The process contains 2 steps:  1. Find all the Item sets that have a Support more than the minimum Support, the result Item Sets is called Frequency Set;  2. Generate the rules from the Frequency Set.

Association rule mining mainly focuses on the generation of Frequency Set. Apriori Algorithm use a process of iterative, the key process is shown as follows:  Ti={ti, f2, f3, ..., t m l ,     Ll=(Large 1-itemsets}; For (k=2: Q, ; k++) do Begin Ck=apriori-gen (Lk-1); //new candidate set For all transactions te F do Begin  Ct=subset (ck, t); //The candidate set contained by transaction t For all candidates CE Ct do C.count++;  End Lk=@ Ck I c.count3minimum support} IO) End Answer= U kLk  Customer ID  First, Frequency Set 1-item Set L, is generated, then Frequency Set 2-item Set L2, the process doesn?t stop until we get a value r that makes L,= NULL. The process stops.

In these k loops, the process generates candidate k-Item Set?s aggregation-Gk. Each Item Sets in &generated by a join of 2 Item Sets that have only 1 different item and belong to Lk-l. The Item Sets in c k  is candidate Item Sets that be used to generate Frequency Sets. The last Frequency Set Lk must be a subset of Ck. Each member of Ckmusf be validated in the transaction data set F to determine whether it should join Lk.

By computing, we can get the association rule of different services in EMS system. For example, there is a high association between the service of sending cake and the service of sending flowers. That is because many customers will send a cake with flowers.

Rule 1 shows that if a customer buys flowers (service code 6), there is a possibility of 45.29% that he will buy cakes (service code 5). Likewise, Rule 2 shows there is a possibility of 66.82% that a customer will use flower express (service code 6) service if he uses the cake express service (service code  In real environment, we must transform the operational data into a two-dimension form.

like the following: Table 4  Column 1 is CustomerlD, a pelD. This process is conducted when we extract the data from Data-Warehouse; transform it into a subject-oriented data  like the following:  Column 1 is CustomerlD, IelD. This process is conducted when we extract the data from Data-Warehouse; transf&m it into a subject-oriented data mart.

5. CONCLUSION  In our practice, we apply a method in data mining--association rule mining, in postal EMS service. It is the first application of association rule mining in this field. Also, it will provide experience to the logistics research.

This kind of analysis shows the trend of collecting, transforming and analyzing service data. It will make operation decision based on scientific basis.
