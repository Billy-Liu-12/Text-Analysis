A Data Mining Approach for Coronary Heart Disease Prediction using HRV  Features and Carotid Arterial Wall Thickness

Abstract  The main objective of our work has been to develop and then propose a new and unique methodology useful in developing the various features of heart rate variability (HRV) and carotid arterial wall thickness helpful in diagnosing cardiovascular disease. We also propose a suitable prediction model to enhance the reliability of medical examinations and treatments for cardiovascular disease. We analyzed HRV for three recumbent postures. The interaction effects between the recumbent postures and groups of normal people and heart patients were observed based on HRV indexes. We also measured intima-media of carotid arteries and used measurements of arterial wall thickness as other features. Patients underwent carotid artery scanning using high-resolution ultrasound devised in a previous study. In order to extract various features, we tested six classification methods. As a result, CPAR and SVM (gave about 85%-90% goodness of fit) outperforming the other classifiers.

1. Introduction  The death rates from diseases in a recent medical report are much higher than from accidents and disasters. Statistical reports show that 130.7 (cancer), 77.2 (cerebrovascular disease), and 37.2 (heart disease) per 100,000 people in the Korean population are dying as the result of the diseases every year. Hence, it is very important to detect early symptoms of heart problems as this detection can result in better treatments with better results. It is also important to develop various indexes that can help in diagnosing cardiovascular disease based on pathological and  physiological characteristics of Korean people in order to enhance the reliability of a diagnosis. In this study, we suggest, a helpful diagnostic supplementary tool, using various features, that takes into consideration all possible linear/nonlinear features of heart rate variability and carotid arterial wall thickness. HRV (Heart Rate Variability) has been used extensively to assess autonomic control of the heart under various physiological and pathological conditions. HRV is used as a clinical tool to diagnose cardiac autonomic function [1]. The analysis of HRV is based on analysis of RR intervals. RR intervals are the series of time intervals between heartbeats. Various features have been used to analyze HRV. For example, a simple time domain analysis of HRV, such as the mean, standard deviation, and root mean square of successive RR interval (RRI) differences have been widely employed in quantification of the overall variability of the heart rate [2]. The frequency domain feature of HRV provides markers of cardiac autonomic regulation [3].

In addition, there are several nonlinear features. The nonlinear interaction between the various regulatory systems of the heart rate gives rise to clinically useful concepts of variability and regularity. Nonlinear analyses include the complexity estimation, the fractal scaling analysis. According to a previous study, there is a relationship between recumbent posture and HRV in patients with CAD (Coronary Artery Disease). In previous studies using a linear analysis of HRV, HRV was found to increase parasympathetic activity and decrease sympathetic modulation in the right lateral posture [4], [5]. In a nonlinear analysis of HRV, a right lateral posture induced an increased complexity and irregularity of the dynamic system, and also induced the highest parasympathetic modulation and the lowest   DOI 10.1109/BMEI.2008.189    DOI 10.1109/BMEI.2008.189     sympathetic modulation among the three recumbent postures in patients with severe CAD. Because of the effect of recumbent posture on HRV, we considered it worthwhile to include the linear and nonlinear features of HRV for three recumbent postures: the supine, left lateral, and right lateral postures in patients with CAD.

We also used measurements of the carotid arterial wall thickness (IMT) for diagnosing cardiovascular disease.

This is noninvasive test, where the lining of the carotid arteries is measured with the use of B-mode ultrasound.

The IMT is measured for the objective of detecting preclinical disease. Measurement of the carotid IMT is considered to be a surrogate maker for the measurement of atherosclerosis, which correlates with the presence of coronary atherosclerosis. The appearance of atherosclerosis in the carotid artery has been highly associated with atherosclerosis in the aorta and the incidence of coronary heart disease [6]. By using software [7], we measured and analyzed the ultrasound images of CCAs (Common Carotid Artery) from CAD patients. In this paper, our goal is to propose and then discuss quantitative measures for HRV and IMT along with a suitable prediction method to enhance the reliability of medical examination and treatment for cardiovascular disease. To achieve this goal, the proposed method, shown in figure 1, works in two steps: We, first, analyzed several time and frequency domain features of HRV as linear features.

As nonlinear features, Princare plots, fractal scaling measures, and complexity estimations were used. We also measured IMT using high-resolution ultrasound and a newly devised image processing algorithm [7].

Last, we applied classification methods to predict patients having cardiovascular disease. For the prediction step, we evaluated several supervised learning methods in order to select a suitable prediction method. We tested the support vector machine, decision tree induction, Bayesian classifiers and associative classifiers to validate these methods? accuracy for diagnosing cardiovascular disease.

Experiments also indicated that with proper classification methods, the results of diagnosis could be improved.

2. Diagnosis Feature Extraction  The various features of HRV can be divided into linear and nonlinear features [8], [9] as well as IMT measurements [7]. In this section, we, briefly, describe how to extract linear and nonlinear features of HRV from ECG signals and how to measure carotid IMT.

Figure 1. A flowchart summarizing individual steps for diagnosing cardiovascular disease.

2.1. ECG Signal Processing  ECG signals are recorded at the Einthoven s Lead- channel with an electrocardiograph during a 5  minutes interval for each of three postures in random order: supine, right position, and left lateral position.

We extracted R-peaks from the ECG recordings based on Thomkin?s algorithm [10]. The RRIs? time series were resampled at a rate of 4Hz to obtain a power spectral density. Figure 2 shows RR intervals of the ECG signal and time series of RR intervals.

2.2. The Linear Features of HRV  2.2.1. Time Domain. Simple time-domain variables that can be calculated include the mean RR interval (RRm), the standard deviation of all RR intervals (SDRR), and the standard deviation of differences between adjacent RR intervals (SDSD).

2.2.2. Frequency Domain. We used Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) to obtain the power spectrum of the RRIs. We then defined the various areas of spectral peaks as follows: - The Total power (TP), 0 Hz to 0.4 Hz.

- Very Low Frequency (VLF) power, 0 Hz~0.04 Hz.

- Low Frequency (LF) power, 0.04 Hz to 0.15 Hz.

- High Frequency (HF) power, 0.15 Hz to 0.4 Hz.

The total power, which is a useful index for detecting  abnormal autonomic activity, is larger in normal subjects than in heart patients [11]. Moreover, low frequency power mainly provides a measure of sympathetic activity with some influence from the parasympathetic nervous system whereas, the high frequency power is responsible to the parasympathetic nervous system. We use the normalized LF (nLF) as an index of sympathetic modulation, the normalized HF     (nHF) as an index of parasympathetic modulation and the ratio (LF/HF) as an index of sympatho-vagal balance. The spectral component values such as nLF and nHF are defined and presented in normalized units.

Time Series of RRIs for an ECG signal.

2.3. The Nonlinear Features of HRV  2.3.1. Poincare Plot (PP). The Poincare Plot (PP) [12] is a scatter gram. It is constructed by plotting each RR interval against the previous one. The PP may be analyzed quantitatively by fitting an ellipse to the plotted shape. The center of the ellipse is determined by the average RR interval. SD1 means the standard deviation of the distances of points from the y = x axis, SD2 means the standard deviation of the distances of  points from the y x RR? ? ? axis where RR is the average RR interval. We also compared the parameters, SD2/SD1, and SD1SD2, describing the relationship between SD1 and SD2 in our study.

2.3.2. The Hurst Exponent (H). Hurst Exponent H is the measure of the smoothness of a fractal time series based on the asymptotic behavior of the rescaled range of the process. The Hurst Exponent H is defined as log( / )  log( ) R S  T , where T is the duration of the sample  of data and R/S is the corresponding value of the rescaled range. If H = 0.5, the behavior of the time series is similar to a random walk. If H < 0.5, the time series cover less distance than a random walk. But if H > 0.5, the time series covers more distance than a random walk [13].

2.3.3. Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA).

DFA quantifies fractal-like correlation properties of the data [14]. The root-mean square fluctuation of the integrated and detrended data are measured in observation box of various sizes and then plotted against the size of the box. The scaling exponent represents the slope of this line, which relates log(F(n)- fluctuation) to log(n-box size). The short-term and long-term scaling exponents are also calculated [15].

2.3.4. Approximate entropy (ApEn). ApEn describes the complexity and irregularity of the signal (RRI). ApEn is low in regular time series and high in complex irregular ones. It can be applied to both deterministic and stochastic signals and their combinations. The detailed algorithm and equations are presented elsewhere, so we do not present the derivation of the equations here. We followed the equations based on earlier studies. The embedding dimension, m, and the tolerance, r are fixed at m = 2 and in the physiological time series data [16], [17].

All variables used in our study are summarized in Table 1.

Carotid Artery Scanning and Image Processing  CCA (Common Carotid Arterial) scanning with a high-resolution ultrasound system was performed by a certified sonographer blinded to the observational data in a dark, air-conditioned room. We measured the IMT at the far wall of a designated 10 mm length of the right common carotid and calculated the average values over 200 points. To measure IMT effectively, a novel method of CCA image processing was devised in a previous study [7]. Image processing was carried out: First, the CCA image was loaded, and the size per pixel was determined with an electronic caliper previously calibrated at a 40 mm depth in the axial direction of a multipurpose phantom by using a broadband linear array transducer. Next, a region of interest (ROI) for each CCA image was selected from distal to proximal, starting from 10 mm proximal to the carotid bifurcation and extending at least 10 mm distal.

The staring point was adjusted to exclude any plaque if     present in this region. The quality of a ROI image was evaluated, and the noise removed with a filtering algorithm [18]. Finally, the IMT was measured by multiplying a calibration factor with the number of pixels.

Next, a region of interest (ROI) for each CCA image was selected from distal to proximal, starting from 10 mm proximal to the carotid bifurcation and extending at least 10 mm distal. The staring point was adjusted to exclude any plaque if present in this region.

The quality of a ROI image was evaluated, and the noise removed with a filtering algorithm [18]. Finally, the IMT was measured by multiplying a calibration factor with the number of pixels.

3. Feature Selection and Evaluation  After all features were extracted, we performed the feature selection and evaluation using an attribute subset evaluator for each of the three recumbent postures separately and for all three postures together.

The subset evaluator [19] takes a subset of attributes and returns a numeric measure that guides the search.

To find a good subset, the search method traverses the feature space. The search method performs greedy hill climbing with backtracking; we can specify how many consecutive non-improving nodes must be encountered before the system backtracks. The results of features selection and evaluation are described in Table 2.

4. Prediction Method for Diagnosing CAD  4.1. The Preprocessing Step  The extracted HRV and IMT features contain continuous variables. Therefore, discretization has been used because the intervals are selected according to the information they contribute to the target variable.

We follow the notation presented in [20].

4.2. Classification Methods  4.2.1. CMAR (Classification based on Multiple Association Rules). CMAR is the associative classification. CMAR [21] generates rules using the FP-growth algorithm. In the pruning phase, CMAR selects only positively correlated rules. This means that for a rule  1 2: , , kr p p p c? ?? , (A literal p is a attribute-value pair and a rule r consist of a conjunction of literals , associated with a  class label c.) the algorithm checks whether 1 2, , , kp p p?  1 2 , , kp p p? ?  is positively correlated with by chi- square testing. All of the other rules are pruned. Also CMAR prunes rules based on database coverage. That is, CMAR removes one data object from the training dataset after it is covered by at least ?  rules (? expresses the database coverage parameter). That allows more selected rules. In the testing phase, for a new sample, CMAR collects the subset of rules matching the sample from the total set of rules. If all the rules have the same class, CMAR assigns this class to the new sample. If the rules are not consistent in the class label, CMAR divides the rules into groups according to the class label and yields the label of the ?strongest? group. The ?strength? of a group of rules is computed using weighted chi-square.

4.2.2. CPAR (Classification based on Predictive Association Rules).  CMAR adopts method of frequent itemset mining to generate candidate rules.

However, CMAR generates a large number of rules.

CPAR [22] takes a different approach to rule generation, based on a rule generation algorithm for     classification known as FOIL [23]. FOIL builds rules to distinguish positive examples from negative ones.

FOIL repeatedly searches for the current best rule and removes all the positive examples covered by the rule until all the positive examples in the dataset are covered. For multi-class problems, FOIL is applied to each class: the examples for each class are used as positive examples and those of other classes as negative ones. The rules for all classes are merged together to form the resulted rule set. During classification, CPAR employs a somewhat different multiple rule strategy than CMAR. If more than one rule satisfies a new one, P, the rules are divided into groups according to class, similar to CMAR. However, CPAR uses the best k rules of each group to predict the class label of P, based on expected accuracy. By considering the best k rules rather than all of the rules of a group, it avoids the influence of lower ranked rules. The accuracy of CPAR on numerous data sets was shown to be close to that of CMAR. However, since CPAR generates far fewer rules than CMAR, it shows much better efficiency with large sets of training data.

4.2.3. SVM (Support Vector Machine). A SVM [19] is an algorithm for the classification of both linear and nonlinear data. It transforms the original data in a higher dimension, from where it can find a hyper-plane for separation of the data using essential training examples called support vectors. The SVM is a basically two class classifier and can be extended for multi-class classification. In our model each object is mapped to a point in a high dimensional space, each dimension of which corresponds to features. The coordinates of the point are the frequencies of the features in the corresponding dimensions. SVM learns, in the training step, the maximum-margin hyper-planes separating each class. In testing step, it classifies a new object by mapping it to a point in the same high- dimensional space divided by the hyper-plane learned in the training step.

4.2.3. Bayesian classifier. This approach chooses the highest posterior probability class using the prior probability computed from the training data set. The NB assumes that the effect of an attribute on a given class is independent of the values of the other attributes. This assumption is called class conditional independence. However, attribute values of HRV data may not be entirely independent from each others. In order to address this problem, in this study, we considered a set of extended Bayesian classifier known to work well with correlated data, including TAN (Tree Augmented Na?ve Bayes) [19].

4.2.4. C4.5 (Decision Tree). C4.5 is a decision tree generating algorithm, based on the ID3 algorithm [19].

It contains several improvements, especially needed for software implementation. These improvements contain: 1  choosing an appropriate attribute selection measure. 2  Handling training data with missing attribute values. 3 Handling attributes with differing costs. 4  Handling continuous attributes.

4.2.5. MDA (Multiple Discriminant Analysis).

Discriminant analysis is an analysis of the dependence method that is a special case of canonical correlation [24]. With more than two groups, there will potentially be more than one discriminant function that can be used to explain the differences among groups. For example, if we want to discriminate among three groups, two canonical discriminant functions will be derived. The first discriminant function separates group 1 from groups 2 and 3, and the second discriminant function separates group 2 from group 3.

In addition, we can obtain classification function for prediction through the discriminant analysis. The classification function is generated for each group. If a new case occurs that we have to classify comes into existence, this case?s subject (patient) will belong to a group that has the highest value of classification function.

5. Experimental Results  Coronary arteriography is performed in patients with angina pectoris, unstable angina, previous myocardial infarction, or other evidence of myocardial ischemia. Patients with stenosis of the luminal narrowing greater then 0.5 were recruited as the CAD group, the others were recruited as part of the normal group. By using angiography, 99 patients with abnormal (CAD) and 94 patients with normal coronary arteries (normal) were studied. Accuracy was obtained by using the methodology of stratified 10-fold cross- validation  for three classes. We used TP (True Positive), FP (False Positive), and Precision and Recall to evaluate the classifiers performance. The parameters of the six classification methods were set as follows. For the CMAR algorithm, the minimum support was set to 0.4%, the minimum confidence to 70%, and the database coverage was set to 3.75 (critical threshold for a 5% ?significance? level, assuming degree of freedom equivalent to 1). More specifically for the CPAR algorithm, the minimum gain set to 0.7, gain similarity ratio to 0.95 and the weight decay factor to 0.67. The best ten rules were used for prediction. For the SVM, the soft margin     allowed errors during training. We set 0.1 for the two- norm soft margin value. The Bayesian classifier, MDA and C4.5 parameters were default values. We tested both the C4.5 tree method and the rule method. We expected that the use of features for all three recumbent postures will produce a more effective tool than the use of features for each recumbent posture. To address this expectation, we presented the accuracy of the classifiers? results for three recumbent postures and for each recumbent posture in Table 3, Table 4, Table 5 and Table 6 respectively. The accuracy of classifiers is shown in Figure 4. As expected, SVM and CPAR showed the best performance among the tested methods. This result means that to include the linear and nonlinear features of HRV for three positions gives more effective results in discriminating between the groups.

6. Conclusion  In this paper, we proposed linear and nonlinear properties of HRV from ECG signal and measurements of IMT. The HRV indexes developed in this study showed consistent result for analyzing linear and nonlinear features. Also, the HRV features can be used to classify the patients with CAD from heart healthy people. For classification, we employed the proposed various features allowing us to choose a classifier from a large pool of well studied classification methods. We suggest the possibility that multi-parametric features, taking into consideration all the whole possible features of HRV as a diagnostic supplementary tool, may be helpful in making a diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. Last, we considered several supervised methods including extended Bayesian classifiers, C4.5, MDA, CMAR, and the SVM. In our experimental results, CPAR and the SVM outperformed the other classification methods.
