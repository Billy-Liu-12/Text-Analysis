Abstract In this study we shall show an association process of synergetic neural networks.

The present association model is based on a top down formulation of the dynamic rule of analogue neural network. It is found that a complete association can be accomplished up to the same number of the embedded patterns as the number of neurons. In practice an association process is simulated for the practical images with 256 gray scale levels and 256x256 size. In addition searching process of the embedded patterns is also realized by means of controlling the attraction parameters. Finally a stochastic model for the dynamic process is also proposed for the association and the searching of the embedded patterns.

81. INTRODUCTION  Recently the associative model based on the autocorrelation characteristics halve been extensively investigated. Since the pioneering works by Anderson[ 11, Kohonen[2], and Nakano[3], many researchers have theoretically analyzed such an association model of connected neurons with a certain autocorrelation matrix[4-16].

Up to date, however, it has been reported that the capacity of the autocorrelation associative model' is not so large and at most -0.15N where N is the number of neurons[l-61. This is considered to be as the result of the many spurious memory states increasing exponentially with N. In addition, as is well known nowadays, the performance is usually depressed especially for the strongly correlated ( or non- orthogonal) embedded patterns (M).

In this work, let us propose a new association model, which is available for MsN, on the basis of the synergetics[7-91. In the present model a complete association of an embedded patter can be accomplished in the order parameter space[9]. Here a stochastic process is involved for the control of the attraction parameters. Controlling a threshold of the switching of the attraction parameters in a stochastic manner, it is found that the present model can be continuously changed between an and a searching model in the order parameter space.

DYNAMICS OF SYNERGETIC ASSOCIATIVE MODEL  In the present model, the internal states and the output of the i th neuron parameter are denoted as q and p (lsi sN), respectively. Denoting the embedded vectors as v (1s-rs-M, lsisN),& the discrete time and the analogue neuron model is assumed.

q i (n+l)=kq i (n)+(l-k)p i (n) 7  where k is a constant between0 and 1, h (?I is called the attraction parameter, and the symbol < , > stands for the innerproduct as  N  <a,b>=x a ib  . (3) i= 1  The state of the i th neuron q of the embedded pattern vectors v (?) ( l s r  s M j  1sisN) as follows  can be expressed in terms of the linear combination  M  q ,(n)=C E (?)(n)v (?1 i+rl i(n) , ( 4 9 r=l  where q ,(n) is the residual error or noise due to the incompleteness of the vector set v (r) , and v (?H is the adjoint vector of v-(?) and defined as  M  (5)  (f) . v + (?1 i = C a  ,,v i , r?=l  here a ,, is given by  a rr, =( v (?1 iv (?1 i )  -1 . (6) i-1  To assure the existence of a nl, MsN has to be assumed. Then q i(n) can be expanded as  N-M  q i ( n ) = ~  < (?)(n)u (?1 i r=l  Here the vector set U and U (?lt have to satisfy the followings.

Therefore, in the time evolution process defined by eqs.(ll) and (12), the residual noise 5 (r)(n) or q i(n) is assured to vanish as n-00 as fas as O<k<l. Hence, in such a condition, eq.(ll) can be reduced to  From this, if h ')(n)=1 , one can confirm that @(n>=o or 1 with  Therefore only one pattern can be selected throu the resultant pattern q , "(n) can be derived as  M q *(n)= 2 5 (r)(n)v (r) , .

SIMULATION RESULTS  In this section let us show an example of the simulation results of our neural model. 12 (=M) images with 256x256 (=N) size and 256 gray scale levels were embedded for the association simulation. Then a random pattern was set as the initial pattern for the association process. The resultant association process is presented in Fig.1 (a)-(c). The time dependence of the order parameters is also given in Fig.2. Finally the completely associated image is shown in Fig.3. From this one can confirm a complete association without any trapping at a spurious Dattern.
