Group Recommender Model for Boosting and  Optimizing Customer Purchases

Abstract - Group recommender systems generate a set of recommendations that will satisfy a group of customers with potentially competing purchase interests. This paper proposes a research and operational model which effectively enhances Group Recommender Model to boost the customer purchases.

For this purpose, it uses the communication and collaboration of two major sources namely Mobile Money Operator and Outlet. MMO proactively monitors the spending pattern of the customers who make purchases using their mobile money. Outlet performs customer segmentation based on RFM (Recency, Frequency and Monetary) score after which a Recursive Cluster Elimination is performed that eliminates customers within the targeted segment.

Recursive Frequent Itemset Mining and Recursive Market Basket Analysis are performed for the rest of customers in the targeted segment. From the obtained results, the product preferences of the remaining customers in the segment are identified based on which offers are formulated and recommended for the entire segment. It is then communicated to the MMO that intimates these offers to the potential customers among the segment. This model results in boosting customer purchases, expanding customer base and effects in the profitability of the combined source.

I. INTRODUCTION  The customer is the end goal of businesses since it is the customer who makes purchase and creates demand that helps in the growth of the business. So, customer satisfaction has been regarded as the crucial activity in the field of Marketing. Different customer groups have different consumption behavior. As the toll of high spenders and frequent shoppers has grown like topsy, the liabilities to meet the interests of these customers have increased rapidly. To explore the purchase interests of the customer, a Recommender System [1] that attempts to analyze a customer?s purchase history is employed so that offers for those specific products can be recommended to  customers. When this recommender system is applied for a group of customers with similar purchase interest then this becomes a Group Recommender System. The important sources that connect customers with the system are described below.

Mobile Money is a mobile financial service provided by the MMO that enables their subscribers to convert their liquid cash into e-money in order to pay bills and accounts, top up mobile credit and receive money across the country?s telecom networks [2]. The MMO stores all the transaction detail records of customers making purchases through mobile money over a period of time.

The outlet is considered a place of business for retailing goods. These outlets store a wide range of datasets that contain the customer?s transaction and purchase details over a period of time. These datasets are used to evaluate and explore the offer recommendations to boost the customer purchases.  In the existing system, customers need to accustom to offers available for products that may not interest them but compromise on their choices just for the sake of saving their shopping expense.

Our Group Recommender System evolves from a Personalized Recommender System that targets the customer group rather than an individual. This paper builds a system that is not only able to extract consumer behavioral features from their consumptive information, but also to analyze, operate and evaluate these extracted features with enhanced techniques such as Recursive Cluster Elimination, Recursive Frequent Itemset Mining and Recursive Market Basket Analysis. In this kind of an approach, the scope of product purchase will be limited since the items focused for offers and their MBA rely on these items.

Generally, offers vary for each individual. When these offers are intimated individually, the cost for formulating offers and the time to perform the process increases making this approach a failure. Our contributions to the proposed work which enhances the traditional system are as follows:  ? We define a group recommender model as shown in Fig 1 for customers in the outlet that recommends offers to the group on the basis of the   DOI 10.1109/ASONAM.2012.218    DOI 10.1109/ASONAM.2012.218     Fig 1: Group Recommender Model for Boosting and Optimizing Customer Purchases  purchase interests of the most potential customers in that group.

? We establish a link between two different sources namely MMO and Outlet that connects customers with the enticing offers for their product preferences.

? Frequent Itemset Mining and Association Rule Mining for customers within the targeted cluster is performed using a platform called HPCC (High Performance Computing Cluster) [3] which serves as a massive parallel-processing computing platform.

? We perform K-Means Clustering using Weka [4] and Market Basket Analysis using HPCC recursively to come out with an enhanced and efficient result that recommends offers not only for their product preferences but also for the items correlated with those products. This enhances the purchase behavior that was prevalent in Individual Recommender System and produces better results.

This paper is organized as follows: the following section presents the overview of the existing work in this system. Later, we describe about the varied techniques adopted in this paper. Subsequently, we elucidate the experimental analysis of the dataset used in our model.

Finally, we conclude with the implications of our proposed research model.



II. RELATED WORK  The major part of the research on group recommendation investigated the core algorithms used for generating the group recommendations. Different strategies are available and two main approaches have been proposed [5]. The first consists of creating a joint user profile for all the users in the group and then performing a recommendation for this artificial user represented by the group profile [6] [7]. This would provide a recommendation for the group that is based on  all user profiles and in some way represent group interests mediated in the group profile. The second approach aggregates the recommendations for each individual member into a single group recommendation list [8].

One of the most commonly-used and successfully- deployed recommendation approaches is collaborative filtering. In the field of collaborative filtering, two types of methods are widely studied: neighborhood-based approaches and model-based approaches. Neighborhood- based methods mainly focus on finding the similar users [9] or items [10] for recommendations. Model-based methods provide item recommendations by first developing a model of user ratings [11].

In our work we are concerned with recommendations to the entire group based on items purchased by potential members of the group. This does not incorporate the above mentioned approaches to promote recommendations. Here, the product preferences of the most potential customers are recommended for the entire group. The most potential customers (most loyal customers) have a good record of purchase history. When their items are recommended, there will be offers for myriad products and the scope of purchase can be improved significantly.



III. BACKGROUND A. Group Recommender Model  Recommendation is a particular form of information filtering, which exploits past behaviors and user similarities to generate a list of information items that is personally tailored to an end-user's preferences [12].

Recommender systems have traditionally recommended items to individual users, but there has recently been a proliferation of recommenders that address their recommendations to groups of users. Group recommenders are built to help groups of people decide a     common activity or item. The recommendation for the group will in general be based on information about preferences of individual group members [13]. Therefore, some type of aggregation method is required, by which information about individual preferences is combined in such a way that the system can assess the suitability of particular items for a group as a whole [5].

B.   Recursive Cluster Elimination  Customer groups are formed according to customer behavior. RFM is behavioral model which considers past customer purchases [14] to prospect the future customer behaviors. The parameters Recency (R) defines the latest purchase made by the customer, Frequency (F) defines the number of purchases made within a certain period and Monetary (M) defines the money spent during a certain period. This paper involves the ?User Definable Band? method to calculate RFM score that adds up the values of R, F and M values. Using this method, we can define specific bands for R, F, M that can be set based on certain criteria. Here the bands of R, F, M are measured in a scale of 1 to 5.This may vary from user to user. For example, if (last visit>=0 day and last visit<51 days), then R can be scaled as 5, if(number of transactions>=15), then F can be scaled as 5, if(Transaction Amount>=15000), then M can be scaled as 5.Similarly, the values 4 to 1for the parameters can be calculated. Now, a Partitioning Clustering technique called K-Means Clustering [15] is adopted to segment the customers in the outlet. The results of the clustering are obtained using a WEKA [4].

The K-Means clustering is a centroid based approach that accurately performs the clustering. Consider Fig 2 in which the (1) customer purchases in the outlet. (2) Using the stored purchase details, RFM score is calculated. (3) Customers (here n=15) in the outlet are clustered based on RFM value into three segments namely ?High, Medium and Low?. This is considered as the first cluster step. Here, the centroids are chosen randomly based on RFM scores. It is then recalculated to get a modified centroid using which the scores nearest to the modified centroid is clustered in one group until no score switches clusters. After the first cluster step, (4) a particular group for which recommendation has to be made is targeted and (5) Recursive Cluster Elimination [16] is performed as shown in Section IV. In this case, the high cluster is being targeted. The RCE output holds only three most preferred customers as depicted in Fig 2. Here, by using RCE we are only eliminating the customers with low R, F scores within the high cluster rather than eliminating the whole of the low cluster. (6) The output of RCE is used as the input of RFIM ? C4, C5, C6 customers are eliminated and C1, C2, C3 are most active within the targeted cluster.

C. Recursive Frequent Itemset Mining  The Frequent Itemset Mining is used to find frequent itemset present in a database. Apriori Algorithm [17] is designed to operate on databases containing transactions (For example, collections of items bought by customers).

The input for this algorithm is derived from results of the FIM. Here, products which occur frequently are identified   Fig 2: Recursive Cluster Elimination  and various scans are performed for it. This scan is nothing but the iterative search for products that occur frequently. This can be determined with a certain support count. In traditional FIM, the support count of an itemset X is defined as the number of transactions that contain X [18]. Products whose support count is below a certain threshold are pruned. Here, the frequent itemset scan is performed for products purchased by customers in   the preferred group and this is done recursively to find the most preferred products by them. Frequent item set mining leads to the discovery of associations and correlations among items in large transactional or relational datasets present in the outlet.

D. Recursive Market Basket Analysis  Association Rule Mining represents an unsupervised learning method that attempts to capture associations between groups of items. MBA has also been referred to in the literature as Association Rule Mining or Affinity analysis[19]. Apriori is a seminal algorithm for mining frequent itemsets and identifying associations for varied customer purchases. In this model, the customers are clustered in the outlet using RFM score as discussed in sub-section B of section III. The output of frequent itemset mining is taken up as input for the MBA. Then, the Market Basket Analysis [20] made for an individual is merged to perform a recursive MBA which represents the group recommendation using which offers can be correlated and intimated to the customers. Here, the offers are formulated on the basis of the results obtained from the RMBA which are then intimated to the customer?s mobile through MMO.



IV. PROPOSED SYSTEM  This section consists of establishing a relationship between Outlet, MMO and Customer to design the group recommender model. Sub-section A deals with the architecture of the proposed system and Sub-section B deals with the algorithm of proposed system by incorporating the K-Means, RFIM, RMBA techniques in our system.
