Abstract?Aerosol Optical Thickness, AOT is one of the factors on determining air quality. The concentration of atmospheric aerosol is determined from radiances of image taken. On this study, we use AVHRR image which is appropriate to retrieve AOT from a wide coverage area. The methods of retrieving aerosol from visible and near-infrared radiance data were applied. The algorithm for mapping was based on dark target method using path radiance and contrast reduction method using atmospheric transmission.

Besides, discussion on the level-1B of AVHRR image was also done on preprocessing for calibration and geometrical correction. Satellite and solar geometrical effects would be studied. Besides the environmental factors and distribution of aerosol particles would also be considered in the algorithm. Comparison between aerosol optical derived from each method would be compared with data from MODIS Aerosol Product available online. Regression analysis was performed to find the correlation between these two set of data  Graphs of radiance measured at visible channel and AOT was generated by the algorithm  to show the relationship between these variables. The look-up table could be used to retrieved the aerosol optical thickness with the sufficient input.12   TABLE OF CONTENTS   1. INTRODUCTION    1 2. MATERIAL AND STUDY AREA  2 3. METHODOLOGY    2 4.

INTRODUCTION  Aerosols are droplet or tiny particles suspended in the air which have size particles in the range of 0.5?m to 100?m.

The aerosol will absorb or scatter the radiation before it reaches the sensor. Aerosol optical thickness (AOT) is one   2 IEEEAC paper #1467, Version  11, Updated Oct 27, 2007  of the parameters which give the concentration of aerosols in the atmosphere. For the dark pixels, the TOA upwelling radiances detected in the visible and near infrared regions are related to the AOT. The AOT also depends on wavelength, satellite zenith angle, sensor zenith angle, azimuth angle, reflectance and aerosol size distribution. The AVHRR onboard the NOAA series satellites have five channels. The first two channels are in visible band (0.63?m) and near infrared band (0.85?m). From the AVHRR imagery and header file with the help of image processing software, PCI Geomatica, we are able to retrieve the TOA radiance, NOAA derived reflectance, satellite zenith angle, solar zenith angle and azimuth angle. The distribution of particles? size is still an unknown by now.

Therefore, the theoretical approach which assumes the aerosol size distribution is a Junge power law with an exponent value of 4.5 [1] was used.

Several researches had been done to estimate the aerosol optical thickness. The method of AOT retrieval by Dense Dark Vegetation (DDV) method had been suggested and studied by some researchers.[2, 3]  The AOT was retrieved from visible observations in nearly dark pixels such as still water bodies or dark dense vegetation. However, the large error happen when there are few DDV pixels in the image [4]. Hence, complementary method which is based on atmospheric transmission was suggested. The method is based on the ratio of transmission by a reference ground measurement. AOT, ?a can be estimated from this equation:  2.1 ),(),(  )(* s  FT L sadvaijij ><?  ??? ?  ??????  Where * ijL? = difference of apparent radiance between two  adjacent pixels.

i= geographical coordinated expressed in line numbers.

j= geographical coordinated expressed in column numbers.

T= transmission between the sun and surface ?v = cosine of satellite zenith angle ?s= cosine of solar zenith angle ??ij = actual ground reflectance difference <?> = mean reflectance of the two pixels s= atmosphere albedo       However in this paper, we used the combination methods.

We used the gas profiles given by U.S. standard atmosphere. The aerosol size distribution was based on a Junge power law. First of all, we retrieve the radiance measured by visible and near infrared channel with solar zenith, satellite zenith, azimuthal angles from AVHRR data.

After that, we calculate the radiances by using the values of AOT and exponent of Junge power law by Mie Theory. An iterative method was performed to get the minimum value of standard deviation. AOT can be obtained from the minimization process. AOT was calculated from Mie theory with the constant and exponent value of Junge power law.

After that, a TOA radiance detected by AVHRR sensor could be related to the AOT. A look-up table which included radiance, AOT, solar zenith angle, satellite zenith angle, azimuthal angle, and exponent of Junge power was set. Therefore, the value of AOT can be determined from the AVHRR data by retrieving the corresponding radiance and angles data. The value of Junge power law can be estimated from the Powell method in the iterative method [5].

2. MATERIAL AND STUDY AREA  The AVHRR data used for this study is acquired from Malaysian Centre of Remote Sensing (MACRES). The imagery was captured at 03:04:09, 22 July 2004. The AOT retrieved from the algorithm was validated by comparing the data with MODIS/Terra Atmosphere Monthly Global Product (MOD08_M3). The AVHRR has five channels. The study area was South China Sea which can be considered as still water bodies. The image acquired extended from longitude 94? 08? 18?E to 122? 41? 09?E and from latitude 21?23? 33?N to 21?05?45? S.

The project entitled Research on the Sea and Islands of Malaysia (ROSES) was launched at South China Sea from 26 Jun 2004 to 1 August 2004. The reflectance was collected by spectro radiometer. The diagram shows the reflectance colleted at Malaysia time 11.00 am, 22 July 2004.

Figure 1 - AVHRR image for channel 1      Figure 2 - AVHRR image for channel 2   3. METHODOLOGY  3.1 Preprocessing and Masking  First of all, the land, cloud and marine water pixels had to be recognized. The pixels were masked and flagged based on the ratio reflectance, spatial uniformity, VIS uniformity test, minimum channel 4 brightness temperature and difference in channel 4 and channel 5.

The radiance can be retrieved from digital number by applying the gain and offset appended in the header files.

The coefficients appended in header files can also be applied to retrieve the albedo for channel 1 and channel 2 while brightness temperature for channel 3, 4 and 5.

e. In the image, we can get the digital number(DN). DN can be converted by the following equation: s= M(DN) + I  ?(1) where  s = albedo M= channel slope      I = channel intercept The slope and intercept are the pre-launch calibration coefficients which were specified in NOAA KLM User?s Guide Appendix D-3. The table contains the pre-launch calibration coefficients.

The albedo can then be converted to radiance:  ] **100  [ ?W  FAR =  where F= extra-terrestrial solar irradiance (W /m2), weighted by the spectral response function W = equivalent width of the spectral response function in ?m.

The values of F and W can be referred at NOAA KLM User?s Guide Table D.3-6.

Geometrical correction was also done with the help of image processing software, PCI Geometrica to correct for the distortion of the image.

3.2 Algorithm  First of all, we retrieve the TOA radiance from the image.

After that, prepare or retrieve the ancillary data such as satellite zenith angle, solar zenith angle, azimuthal angle and GCP from header file.

We assume the aerosol size was distributed in a Junge power law:  Va(r) = k(r/0.1)4            if r ? 0.1?m Va(r) = k(r/0.1)-(?-4) Where Va = aerosol volume spectrum 0.1 k= constant r= particle radius ?= exponent of Junge power law  The aerosol of optical thickness ?a was determined from iterative method.

Then, we make an initial guess for the value of k and ?. In this case, we assume k= 5, ?=2.

The aerosol optical thickness, phase function and single scattering albedo were calculated with the value of k and ?.

The calculation was performed with the help of interactive Mie Scattering Calculator. The AOT was retrieved based on the equation below:  Ls = Lo(?a)+ Fd(?a)T(?a) ?(?) /( 1-s(?a)?(?) ) where Ls = radiance detected at sensor  Lo = path radiance due to photons scattered by the atmosphere to sensor.

?a = aerosol optical thickness Fd = downward flux T= upward transmission ?= surface reflectance s= apherical albedo    However, it is unable to find the value of downward flux and transmission by measurement until now. The values of down flux are predicted by radiation chart. The use of radiation chart requires the temperature and water vapor profiles. The data were found from simulation of MODTRAN by using the atmosphere profiles provided in the database of software. The transmission can be estimated from delta-Eddington method( Joseph et. Al. 1976):  ? ???  ??  + ?++=  ?  3/4 ]3/2[]3/2[)(  /eT  Where ?= cosine of solar zenith angle ?= aerosol optical thickness  The albedo can be retrieved from equation(1). The reflectance was calculated with equation [Tassan(1987)]:    cos)()1( )(  )( TFr  Ln w ??  ???? ?  =  Where n= refractive index  of sea water (n=1.34) r = Fresnel reflectivity, assumed constant (r=0.021) F0(?) = exterrestrial Solar irradiance ?0 = Solar Zenith angle T0 = diffuse transmittance from the sun to water surface.

Solar angle can be determined by time, date and GCP from AVHRR data.

Spherical albedo can be found from the following equation:  )](6)(43[  21 ???? EEs +?  + =   where E1(?) and E2(?) are exponential integrals for the argument ?. The computation method can be referred to ?Handbook of Mathematical Functions? [6].

From the equations above, we can generate a look up table for transmission, reflectance, and spherical albedo with ? ranging from 0 to 1.

After that a look up table which relate radiance detected by sensor with aerosol optical thickness was generated.

With all these look up-tables, we can retrieved AOT from the AVHRR and ancillary data.

Then, we calculate the standard deviation with the equation:  ? =  2/1    ),( ),,,(   ? ? ?  ?  ? ? ?  ? ?? ?  ? ?? ?  ? ??  =i m i  c i  L L  ?? ????     where ),,,( ????ciL =corresponding radiances  calculated with aerosol optical thickness ? and exponent ?.

),( ??miL = upwelling radiances measured at visible and near infrared  channels.

?= zenith angle ? = azimuthal angle   solar azimuthal angle can be related to  time and position with the following equation:    e s ?  ???? cos  sincoscoscos =  where  ?e= the solar elevation angle  ? = the hour angle of the present time  ? =the current sun declination  ? = local latitude  All the value for solar geometry can be retrieved by given the input value of time, date and GCP with the solar calculator software.

If ?>0.01, find the new value of k and ? by Powell method.

Repeat the calculation of aerosol optical thickness. The process is iterated until ?<0.01.

The value of aerosol optical thickness corresponding to the radiance detected by sensor was recorded with the relevant ancillary data.

After that a look up table which relate radiance detected by sensor with aerosol optical thickness was generated. With all these look up-tables, we can retrieved AOT from the AVHRR and ancillary data.

The validation work with measurement data by sun photometer could not be done because the Malaysia Meteorology Department could not provide the data. Further validation work with sun photo- meter at coincident time and location would be performed in future research of our study.

6. CONCLUSION The aerosol optical thickness retrieved from the algorithm comprises with the AOT product from Modis. The aerosol optical thickness depends on several environmental factors, solar and satellite geometrical factors, wavelength of radiation and distribution of particles? size. Although water vapor contents had effects on AOT retrieved, but it has only minor effect on tropical marine area. The variation of water vapor content is not so important compared to other studied factor. However, the coming study may had more further study on this effect with solid proofs. The calculation method in this study may also be explored, since the calculation methods were quite complicated and non- efficient especially for large pixels data.
