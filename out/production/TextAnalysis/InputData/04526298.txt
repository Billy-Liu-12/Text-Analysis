Abstract?The return of humans to the Moon will require  increased capability beyond that of the previous Apollo  missions.  Longer stay times and a greater flexibility with  regard to landing locations are among the many  improvements planned. A descent and landing system that  can land the vehicle more accurately than Apollo with a  greater ability to detect and avoid hazards is essential to the  development of a Lunar Outpost, and also for increasing the  number of potentially accessible Lunar sortie locations. This  descent and landing system should allow landings in more  challenging terrain and provide more flexibility with regard  to mission timing and lighting considerations, while  maintaining safety as the top priority. The lunar landing  system under development by the ALHAT (Autonomous  Landing and Hazard Avoidance Technology) project is  addressing this by providing terrain-relative navigation  measurements to enhance global-scale precision, an onboard  hazard detection system to select safe landing locations, and  an Autonomous GNC (Guidance, Navigation, and Control)  capability to process these measurements and safely direct  the vehicle to a landing location.  This landing system will  enable safe and precise lunar landings without requiring  lunar infrastructure in the form of navigation aids or a priori  identified hazard-free landing locations. The safe landing  capability provided by ALHAT uses onboard active sensing  to detect hazards that are large enough to be a danger to the  vehicle but too small to be detected from orbit a priori.
