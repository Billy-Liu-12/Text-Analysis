A NEW METHOD FOR AUTOMATICALLY CONSTRUCTING CONCEPT  MAPS BASED ON DATA MINING TECHNIQUES

Abstract: In recent years, some methods have been presented for  dealing with concept maps construction to provide adaptive learning guidance to learners. In this paper, we present a new method to automatically construct concept maps based on the a-priori algorithm and the analysis of the relationships between concepts. The proposed method provides a useful way to automatically construct concept maps in adaptive learning systems.

Keywords: Adaptive learning; a-priori algorithm; concept maps;  questions-relationship mining; concepts-relationship analysis   1. Introduction  In recent years, some researchers focused on the research topics of adaptive learning systems [2]-[9]. In [7], Lee et al. presented a method to automatically construct concept maps for conceptual diagnosis of e-learning. They used the a-priori algorithm [1] for automatically constructing concept maps and proposed the Remedial-Instruction Path (RIP) algorithm to build the Intelligent Concept Diagnostic System (ICDS). However, Lee et al.?s method has the following drawbacks:  (1) Because it only considers the association rules that questions are not correctly answered, it will miss some information about questions that are correctly answered by the learners.

(2) It will build unnecessary relationships or lose some relationships between concepts in the constructed concept maps.

In this paper, we present a new method to automatically construct concept maps for adaptive learning systems to overcome the drawbacks of Lee et al.?s method [7]. The proposed method constructs concept maps based  on the analysis of concept maps and the a-priori algorithm [1]. The proposed method provides a useful way to construct concept maps for adaptive learning systems.

2. A new method for automatically constructing concept maps  Let  denote the learner, where  Assume that there are m questions  and  in a test paper, then we can get a grade matrix G, shown as follows:  jS .1 nj ??  ,,, 21 ?QQ mQ  ,        n  mnmm  n  n  m  SSS  ggg  ggg ggg  Q  Q Q  G  ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  =  where ,  denotes that the learner does not correctly answer the question , denotes that the learner  correctly answers the question  and . Furthermore, assume that we have a questions-concepts mapping matrix QC, shown as follows:  ]1,0[?jig 0=jig jS  iQ 1=jig  jS  ,iQ ,1 mi ?? nj ??1  ,        p  mpmm  p  p  m  CCC  qcqcqc  qcqcqc qcqcqc  Q  Q Q  QC  ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  =  where  denotes the conceptual weight of the concept in the question , ,  and  . The proposed method for constructing the concept map based on the concepts appearing in the questions of a test paper is now presented as follows:  jiqc  jC iQ 10 ?? jiqc ,1 mi ??  pj ??1  Step 1: Based on the learners? testing records and the a-priori algorithm [1], mine the following two kinds of       association rules between questions: (1) If the question  is correctly learned by the  learner, then the question  is also correctly learned, iQ  jQ  (2) If the question  is incorrectly learned by the learner, then the question  is also incorrectly learned.

iQ  jQ  Construct the association rules from each question in the large 1-itemset to all other questions and calculate the confidence of each mined association rule by the a-priori algorithm, where the confidence ( )ji QQ ?conf  of an association rule  is calculated as follows: ji QQ ?  ( ) ( )( ) ,sup ,sup  conf i  ji ji Q  QQ QQ =?  where  is a question in the large 1-itemset,  is a question in the test paper, ? ? denotes the association rule from  to , ?  iQ jQ  ji QQ ?  iQ jQ ( )ji QQ ?conf ? denotes the confidence of the association rule ? ?, ?  ji QQ ?  ( )ji QQ ,sup ? denotes the support of the 2-itemset ( )ji QQ , , ? ? denotes the support of the large 1-itemset , ( )iQsup iQ  ji ? ,  and . ,1 mi ?? mj ??1 Step 2: Construct two kinds of question-relationship maps based on the associated rules derived in Step 1. For the associated rules that the learner failed the question  and failed the question , we build a relationship from question  to question  in the constructed ?failure-to-failure question-relationship map?. For the rules that the question  is correctly learned and the question  is also correctly learned by the learner, we build a relationship from question  to question  in the constructed ?correct-to-correct question-relationship map?, and let the confidence of an association rule be the confidence of the relationship between questions build from it.

iQ  jQ  iQ jQ  iQ  jQ  jQ iQ  Step 3: Convert the ?failure-to-failure questions- relationship map? and the ?correct-to-correct questions- relationship map? derived in Step 2 into the failure-to-failure concepts-relationship table and the correct-to-correct concepts-relationship table based on the questions-concepts mapping matrix, respectively, described as follows. Calculate the relevance degree ( )  yx QQji CC ?rev  between concepts  and  from the relationship , shown as follows:  iC jC  yx QQ ?  ( ) ( ) ( )yxQQji QQWWCC jCyQiCxQyx ??=? conf,Minimumrev  (1) where ? ( )  yx QQji CC ?rev ? denotes the relevance degree of  the relationship ? ? converted from the relationship ? ?,  ji CC ?  yx QQ ? ( ) ( ),1,0rev ?? yx QQji  CC   denotes the  concept in the question ,  denotes the concept in the question ,  denotes the weight of the concept  in the question ,  denotes the weight of the  concept  in the question , ?  iC  xQ jC  yQ iCxQW  iC xQ jCyQW  jC yQ ( )yx QQ ?conf ? denotes the confidence of the relationship ? ?,  and  Furthermore, let the ?  yx QQ ? ,1 pi ??  ,1 pj ?? mx ??1 .1 my ?? ( )yx QQ ?conf ? be the confidence of the relationship  ? ?. If there is more than one relationship between any two constructed concepts, then we let the relationship that has the maximum relevance degree be the relationship between the two concepts.

ji CC ?  Step 4: For any two concepts  and  in the failure-to-failure concepts-relationship table and the correct-to-correct concepts-relationship table derived in Step 3, combine the two concepts-relationship tables into the combined concepts-relationship table, described as follows:  iC jC  (1) If the relationship ? ? only exists in one of concepts-relationship tables, we simply copy it to the combined concepts-relationship table.

ji CC ?  (2) If the relationship ? ? exists in both concepts-relationship tables, we calculate the difference  degree  ji CC ?  ( ) ,)rev(,)rev(MAX )rev()rev(  ***  ***  jiji  jiji  CCCC  CCCC  ??  ??? where  ? ? denotes the relevance degree of the relationship  in the ?correct-to-correct  concepts-relationship table?, ? ? denotes the relevance degree of the relationship  in the ?failure-to-failure concepts-relationship table?, and  If the difference degree is larger than a threshold value  *)rev( ji CC ?  ji CC ? **)rev( ji CC ?  ji CC ?  pi ??1 .1 pj ??  ?  given by the user, where ,10 ?? ?  we delete the relationship between the concepts  and .

Otherwise, we choose the relationship which has the largest relevance degree between the concepts  and  For any two concepts  and  in the combined concepts-relationship, if the confidence of the concepts-relationship between  and  is lower than the minimum confidence given by the user, we delete the relationship between the concepts  and  to get the  iC jC  iC .jC  iC jC  iC jC  iC jC       completed concepts-relationship table. Then, for each relationship  in the completed concept relationship table, add an edge from  to  into the concept map with the relevance degree of relationship  to construct concept map.

An Example  We use the comparison chart of the conceptual weight relationships in test questions shown in Table 1 [7] and the chart of test portfolio of five learners as shown in Table 2 [7] for constructing concept maps   Table 1. Comparison chart of the conceptual weight relationships in test questions [7]  Concept Question  1C  2C  3C  4C  5C  1Q  1 0 0 0 0  2Q  0 1 0 0 0  3Q  0.5 0 0.5 0 0  4Q  0.3 0.4 0 0.3 0  5Q  0 0 0 0 1   Table 2.

We convert the comparison chart of the conceptual  weight relationships in the test questions shown in Table 1 to the questions-concepts mapping matrix QC and convert the chart of the test portfolio of the learners shown in Table 2 to the grade matrix G, shown as follows:        03.004.03.0 005.005.0  CCCCC  Q Q Q Q Q  QC  ? ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  ? ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  = ,  .

SSSSS  Q Q Q Q Q  G  ? ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  ? ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  =  [Step 1] Based on the grade matrix G, we can get the table of the 1-itemset?s supports of the questions that the learners have wrongly answered and the table of the 1-itemset?s supports of the questions that the learners have correctly answered, as shown in Table 3 and Table 4, respectively.

Then we construct the rules from the items in the large 1-itemset with respect to other questions to get the rules tables and the confidences of the rules, as shown in Table 7 and Table 8, respectively. Table 7 shows the rules ? ? that the learner failed the question  and then failed the question , where   and  .

Furthermore, we can calculate the relevance degree between concepts in questions that the question  is correctly learned and the question  is correctly learned, too. Then, we can get the ?correct-to-correct? concepts-relationship table, as shown in Table 10.

It should be noted that the concept map constructed by  the method presented in [7] is shown in Figure 4. By comparing Figure 3 and Figure 4, we can see that the relationships  and  in the completed concept map constructed by the proposed method shown in Figure 3 have been removed. From the grade matrix G and the questions-concepts mapping matrix QC, we can see that the learners  and  who correctly answered the question  and the question  do not correctly answer the question . It indicates that the learners  and who correctly learned the concept  and the concept still failed to learn the concept , i.e., the concept should not be the pre-required concept of the concept and the concept  Therefore, the concept map constructed by the proposed method is more reasonable than the one constructed by the method presented in [7].
