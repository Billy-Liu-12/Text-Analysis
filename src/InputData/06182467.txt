I. INTRODUCTION  Data mining is the rise of a new technology in the middle of 1990s, it is the the key steps to knowledge discovery (KDD) process. Data Mining (DM) is from a large number of incomplete, noisy, ambiguous, random practical application data, to extract implicit, unknown for people in advance, but it is the association useful Information potentially and knowledge discovery process[ I]. Association rule mining, which is an important data mining research direction, a large number of database relationship are found between itemsets[2]. There are many association rule mining algorithms, presently the core method is based on the recurrence of frequency set theory. Genetic algorithm is association rules in process of mining, which does not generate candidate frequent set. There are many iterative methods for data mining, but there is easy-premature and local convergence problems in the traditional basic genetic algorithm, a simple genetic algorithm used to solve the problem is based on the improvement of the genetic algorithm.



II. ASSOCIATION RULES  Association rules is this form of rule in the database: occurrence of certain events causing occurrence of other events.

Problem of mining association rules can be formal description as  follows[3]: Assume set for all data items is 1= {il,i2, ... ,in}' which i  j (1 ? j ? n) is called data items. D is recorded as  transaction set, each Tof transactions is a collection of items, and  T c I . Each transaction has a unique corresponding identifier TID. X is a set of items in I, if X c T ,it is said that T contains

X. Association rule is implicative form such as A ? B , where A c I, Bel, and A (l B = 0. Generally the following two parameters are used to describe properties of association rules.

Support degree S (A ? B): If in the transaction database,  s% transaction contains A u B , then support degree of association rules A ? B is s. It is a measure of the importance of association rules, which reflected the prevalence appearance of  association rules A ? B in transaction data.

ConfidenceC(A ? B): If in the transaction database, there is  c% transaction containing A and B at the same time, then the  Confidence of association rules A ? B is c. Confidence is a measure of the accuracy of association rules, which shows the necessary degree of association rules.

Given a transaction set D, mining association rules is to generate association rules with its support and confidence, respectively, greater than the minimum support threshold and minimum confidence threshold given by the user. If support degree and confidence are more than their threshold,  A ? B can be seen as a meaningful association rules.



III. ASSOCIATION RULES MINING BASED ON IMPROVED GENETIC ALGORITHM  Genetic algorithm is an optimization techniques based on mechanism of natural selection and genetic[4]. It relies on natural random algorithm to approach the optimal solution, which has a good global search capability, and has become a powerful tool for optimization, search and solving NP problems. But the traditional genetic algorithm has some unavoidable drawbacks, such as "prone to premature phenomenon" and low-search efficiency in the post-evolution, making the fmal search result is not global optimal solution, but is local optimal solution. To solve the above problem, we improve the traditional genetic algorithm as the followings:  A. Coding Scheme  As genetic algorithm can not process space solution data directly, before conducting the search, the solution space variable must be encoded into genetic string structure with genotype data,  December 24-26, 2011    that is chromosomes. Combination genetic operators and the need for mining association rules, we adopt coding with real number.

This encoding method has advantages of high accuracy, easy searching space and easy implementation. Number of elements in an array of real numbers is corresponding to the number of fields in the database transaction, elements of an array of real numbers representing the field of property value. After this, crossover and mutation operations on the individual has become the operation of the array.

B. Design of Fitness Function  Support degree is a measure of the importance of association rules. Support degree represents this rule how much in all matters, the greater the support, the more important association rules.

Although some association rules have a high degree of confidence, but the support degree was low, which indicating little opportunity to use the rule, therefore, it is not important [5].

In view of such features of association rules, in this paper support degree of association rules is defined as fitness function.

Fitness function of the rules is defmed as follows:  fitness( R;) = - = p s? { S q  (1)  Where S ?  is support degree of a new rule created by genetic manipulation for the formation, S is support threshold given by the user. When Ri is the rules to comply with the requirements, fitness function value should be greater than I, otherwise, fitness function value is less than 1, this rule will be eliminated in the next genetic generation.

C. Improvement of Genetic Operators Genetic algorithms use genetic operators to act on the  population, carrying on operations of selection, crossover and mutation, which resulting in a new generation of groups. Genetic operators determines the search capability and convergence of genetic algorithm [6].

1) Improvement of selection operator The traditional method of genetic algorithm uses roulette  wheel selection to choose the mating group, that is according to proportion of individual fitness and average fitness to determine the proportion of the individual copy. Roulette wheel selection method will have the opportunity to obtain a copy for each individual, and fail to reflect the good competitiveness of the individual, and can not achieve the principle of survival of the fittest in genetic algorithm.

In view of this, we use a population-based order of individual fitness by the selection algorithm instead of roulette wheel selection method in this paper. The process was described as follows:  First ( ) { to sort according to fitness size of the individual;} While stocks have not been scanned Do  { at the top of the individual with one copy; in the middle with two copies; behind not copy;}  2) Improvement of crossover To speed up the convergence rate, and to prevent premature  convergence, in the paper points of crossover operation was determined by encodelengthln, where n is an input parameter of genetic algorithm, at run time it can be set to 10,20 and so on.

Cross-bit was randomly generated.

3) Improvement of mutation operator In the genetic algorithm, if a fixed mutation probability was  used, this would make excellent genes damaged by mutation, and is not conducive to the introduction of new genes. Here, we use a dynamic mutation probability of the method and described below:  If (individual fitness <average fitness) then P is small or zero; Else P is relatively large This will prevent the mutation from destruction because of  good genes, the introduction of new genes, which can greatly increase the performance of GA.

D. Algorithm Description  The improved genetic algorithm was applied in mining association rules, the algorithm described as follows:  1) Initialize: according to the given model for encoding. And an initial population P = {Al'?""'A,,} was randomly generated, n is the number of individuals in the initial population. And to get support degree threshold S and confidence threshold C given by the user;  2) Calculate each individual's support and confidence; 3) Calculate each individual fitness f(A) = S? / S in current  population, according to fitness value to filter: if frAY> 1 and confidence is greater than C then into the rule base, otherwise to remove it, and calculate the individual m which survived;  4) !f m<n, then to randomly generate (n-m) individuals, and re-calculate the fitness, or skip (4).

5) Selection. Based on the size of Fitness value to sort, then by a certain sort proportion for individual copy (two copies of the individual standing in the front, middle with one copy, the latter not copy);  6) Cross operation. From copy group to randomly select two individuals, these two individuals to cross for cross-points of encodelengthln, from the results to select a best individual into the new population.

7) Mutation. According to the comparison of individual fitness and average fitness to determine the probability of individual variation, according to the individuals to determine the probability of mutation;  8) !fto meet termination condition, then stop and output the result, otherwise jump to (2);  9) Extraction according to rule.

E. The Classical Algorithm for Frequent Set  A classical algorithm of association rule mining algorithm is Apriori algorithm, the core idea of Apriori algorithm is to devide the work of the association rules into two steps: the frrst step is to search through a database of things all the frequent itemsets by way of iterative; the second step is to construct rules meeting the minimum concentration of users trust from the frequent item.

Mining or identify all frequent itemsets is the core task of Apriori algorithm, accounting for most of the computation. The overall performance of mining association rules is determined by the first step, the second step is relatively easy to implement[3].

In order to generate all frequency sets, using the recursive method. Brief description of its core ideas is as follows:  ? Ll = {large l-itemsets};  ? for (k = 2; Lk-1 "* 0 ; k) do begin ? Ck = apriori-gen (Lk-1); II new candidate set ? for all transactions tED do begin  ? Ct = subset (Ck, t); II Services included in the candidate set t  ? for all candidates c E Ct do c.count;  ? end  ? Lk = {c E Ck I c.count;;::: Smin}  ? end  ? Answer = U Lk;  First of all to generate the frequent 1 - itemset L" and then frequent 2 - itemset L2, until there is r allowing Lr is empty, then algorithm stops[4]. Here in the frrst k-cycle, the frrst candidate produced a collection of k-itemsets Ck, Ck in the each item in the set is only one item on two different frequency Lk-1 are set to be (k-2) connection generated. Ck the items in the set is used to generate candidate frequent set collection, the fmal frequent sets Lk must be a subset of Ck. Each element in Ck is validated in the transaction database to determine whether to join Lk, where the verification process is a bottleneck of the performance of the algorithm. This approach requires multiple scans large transaction databases, that is, if the most frequent set contains 10 items, you need to scan the transaction database 10 times, it takes a lot of 1/0 load.

It may produce a large number of candidate sets, and may need to repeat the scan of the database, they are two major drawbacks of the Apriori algorithm. To improve the efficiency of the algorithm, Mannila and other introduced pruning techniques to reduce the size of candidate sets Ck, which can significantly improve the generation of all frequent sets algorithms. Pruning strategy introduced in algorithm is based on a property: an item set is frequent set if and only if all its subsets are frequent sets. So, if a candidate in the set of Ck, (k-l) subset does not belong to a subset of Lk_" then this itemset can be pruned with no longer   considered, the pruning process can reduce the computational support of all the candidate sets degree of price.

Applied mathematical mtatistics is the most important and one of the most active subjects, it was born before the invention of the computer, so far, several hundred years of history. Today, very powerful and effective tool for mathematical and statistical methods have become the basis of the information consulting industry. Information age, the consulting industry is more developed. However, mathematical statistics, and database technologies, and not too fast, database query language SQL aggregate functions in the function is extremely simple, is a proof.

Consulting with a database query data is not enough. Once people have a query to the knowledge discovery from data, data interpretation to the data summarized from the requirements of probability theory and mathematical statistics to get a new life, so will the DMKD this juncture, immediately showing a "suddenly, such as spring night , the Trees 10000 Pear Tree open"prosperity.

Has always been to mathematical statistics and visualization tools for calculating the famous American SA S Corporation, the leading declared DMKD ranks.

Knowledge of data mining can fmd the following categories: broad-based knowledge, reflecting the common things of similar nature of knowledge; feature-based knowledge, to reflect the characteristics of knowledge in all aspects of things; differences in knowledge-based, reflecting the different properties of the difference between the knowledge of things; associated with knowledge-based, reflecting the dependence between things or associated knowledge; predictive knowledge, based on historical and current data speculate about the future of data; deviation from the type of knowledge, revealing things deviate from the conventional anomalies. All this knowledge can be in a different conceptual level was found, with the concept of tree improvement, from the micro to meso to the macro, in order to meet the different users, different levels of decision-making. For example, data from a supermarket warehouse, can be found in a typical association rules may be a "likelihood of customers to buy bread and butter also buy milk," may be "almost all of the customer to buy food with a credit card," which kinds of rules for businesses to develop and implement customized marketing plans and strategies are very useful. The discovery tools and methods commonly used classification, clustering, pattern recognition, visualization, decision trees, genetic algorithms, uncertainty processing.



IV. ApPLICATION EXAMPLE  According to students borrowing information in a school library to establish a database. Properties of student borrowing information database are shown in Table I.

Where reader units can be divided into department of economics, business administration department, tourism management department, accounting department, public administration department and so on. Readers can be divided into master, undergraduate, college, adult education and so on.

Number of readers borrowing books can be divided into 1-5, 5- 10,11-29 and above 30.

In front of the proposed algorithm, to mine on the basis of borrowing information database, and found some association rules are as follows:  A. <400000000> <4> (10% Support, 100% Confidence)  <Readers: Accounting>---+<has borrowed books on Finance: 30 more> Accounting readers demand greatly on the books of financial and monetary, so to buy the fmancial fmancial books for accounting department as much as possible.
