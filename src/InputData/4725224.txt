MANET Mining: Mining Temporal Association Rules

Abstract  A wireless ad hoc network (MANET) is a collection of autonomous nodes or terminals that communicate with each other by forming a multihop radio network and maintaining connectivity in a decentralized manner. MANET is charac- terized by a rapidly changed topology. As a result packets select different multi-hops paths to reach their destinations.

Even though packets are somehow independent from each other, there are still some hidden relations (patterns) among them. These relations may be utilized to give useful infor- mation to different MANET protocols. In this work, asso- ciation rules technique is applied in time domain to obtain these hidden relations.

1 Introduction  MANET needs efficient distributed algorithms to deter- mine network organization. However, most of the algo- rithms ? including broadcasting, multicasting, unicasting, electing a leader, determining viable routing paths, deliv- ering messages and keys ? are not well-defined problems.

Accordingly, MANET algorithms are still immature, and  there is no doubt that the unpredictable topology (mobility) is the main reason of this immaturity.

One way to enhance MANET performance is to disclose the hidden characteristics (patterns) of MANET and to utilize them in the distributed algorithms. This can be achieved by analyzing the MANET traffic in a tempo-spatial domain. In this work, a new framework is proposed. Applying the as- sociation rules to the packets traffic in MANET with respect to time. This technique pave the way for the other MANET algorithms. Fosca and Dino [3] gave general idea about the geographic knowledge discovery.

The rest of the paper is organized as following: The second section describes the common aspects between MANET mining and data mining. The third section explains the pro- posed framework. The fourth section shows the simulation and the results. The fifth section provides a conclusion for the paper and the future work.

2 MANET Mining and Data Mining: A Vi- sion of Convergence  Data mining, among transactions, is similar to a large extent to MANET mining, among packets, for the following reasons:  1. Each transaction in data mining is a set of items (at- tributes).

through a set of hops (nodes).

2. Data mining is applicable to a database with a large number of transactions. MANET mining is applicable to a traffic with a large number of packets.

3. The purpose of mining association rules in a database is to discover all rules that have support and confi- dence (predictability) greater than or equal to the user- specified minimum support and minimum confidence.

The problem of mining association rules in MANET is to discover the most likely patterns (such as routes) among packets and the cooperated nodes.

4. Each frequent set in data mining maps different pack- ets with common hops along the path in MANET min- ing.

Nowadays databases became a mature technology and mas- sive collection and storage of data became feasible at in- creasingly cheaper costs. Accordingly the powerful meth- ods for discovering knowledge from data, go beyond the limitations of traditional statistics, machine learning and database querying. MANET mining is described next sec- tion.

3 MANET Mining  3.1 Introduction  Beside Bramer?s notation [1], new structures and opera- tions are defined in this section. Nodes in MANET mining need not read from a database. Each packet keeps track of the path it is following. Whenever the packet goes through some node, it adds that node?s identity to the list of nodes traveled. As soon as the destination receives the packet it gets that list. The destination node add this list (entry or transaction) to a table. This table is called in this work the traffic table. The Traffic table contains all packets? lists re- ceived by a node. Thus each node gets a sample of the traffic  ...

in MANET to construct its own traffic table without any re- quest from any other node. In other words, nodes do not add new traffic to MANET; they just capture passively the passing packets and check their lists. Now, nodes exploit traffic tables by applying data mining techniques to get use- ful information.

The traffic table can be condensed by coding the presence of each node with one bit.

3.2 Demonstration on a Simple MANET  This section explains how association rules mining is applied to MANET. Association rules seek to identify what things go together [5]. Consider the scenario in Fig. 1. There are 15 nodes in this Ad hoc network. The node N1 is the source and the node N2 is the destina- tion. For simplicity, a small number of packets is con- sidered. The source sends 4 packets through the path < N1, N3, N5, N6, N9, N14, N13, N2 >. Then the topol- ogy changes. Nodes N5 and N14 leave. Node N4 and N8 enter, and the source sends three packets through the path < N1, N3, N4, N6, N9, N8, N13, N2 >. Again the     topology changes. Node N9 leaves. Nodes N14 and N15 join, and the next three packets will follow the path < N1, N3, N4, N6, N15, N14, N8, N13, N2 >. Now the traffic table in both the source and destination will be as in tables 1 and 2. Mining association rules is applied to this traffic table. Assume that the support s = 70%. Then L7 = MFS = {N1, N2, N3, N6, N9, N13, N14} The set of all frequent sets is: L = L1 ? L2 ? L3 ? L4 ? L5 ? L6 ? L7 The nodes in each frequent set are correlated with sup- port=70%.

Note that any subset of the maximum frequent set is a fre- quent set (according to the downward closure property [6]).

From now onwards, it is enough to calculate the MFS.

4 Simulation and Results  New metric is defined in this section. It is defined as follows:  Correlation?ratio(s) = #ofNodes in MFS(s)  #of nodes involved in routing  The higher ratio indicates better correlation among nodes. Before simulation, mining, and analysis of the traffic, the metric is applied to the demonstration example for illustration. From the previous section, the MFS of the traffic table in tables 1 and 2 with support s = 70% is {N1, N2, N3, N6, N9, N13, N14}. The number of nodes in MFS is 7 and the number of nodes involved in routing in this traffic table is 11 (i.e. columns that contain at least one ?1? value).

Correlation?ratio(with s = 70%) =  In this example there are few nodes with few pack- ets. That means the route from the source to the des- tination does change few nodes only. In real scenario, more number of nodes may communicate for longer time; this results in huge number of packets (traffic) with low Correlation?ratio. This is because the routes are completely changed after some time. In other words, the number of common nodes decreases with time passing. Accordingly, the Correlation?ratio decreases.

One way to improve the Correlation?ratio is to mine the MANET traffic for a short time interval ? (in seconds or- der).

For closer view the traffic table is roughly divided in the demonstrative example into two equal tables traffics (i.e.

two periods of time). The first five tuples in the table oc- curred in the first interval and the rest occurred in the sec- ond interval. By mining both of these traffic tables with the same support the MFSs results are: MFS1 = {N1, N2, N3, N5, N6, N9, N13, N14}  Parameter value  Number of the nodes 100 Routing protocol AODV,DSDV,DSR Mobility model Random way point  Pause time 1 second Radio transmission range 250 meters  Channel capacity 1 mbps Data flow constant bit rate  Data packet size 512 bytes Node placement random  Terrain area 1500m*1500m Simulation time 120 second  Propagation model Two Ray Ground Speed 5, 10,..., 50 m/sec  Table 3. The Simulation Parameters.

MFS2 = {N1, N2, N3, N4, N6, N8, N13} Correlation?ratio1(? = 70) = 810 Correlation?ratio2(? = 70) = 710 Both of these ratios are higher than the ratio taken for one traffic table.

For the accuracy purpose in the time is divide into in- tervals (slices). Each interval ? = 2 and 3 sec. The Correlation?ratio is calculated for each interval. Then the mean of these Correlation?ratios is calculated. The MANET traffic generated by NS2 [4] [2] [7] and the used parameters in the simulator are shown in the Table 3.

In this work several parameters with their effects on MANETs mining are studied. Figures 3, 4 and 5 show the effect of the time interval ? on the Correlation?ratio with s = 70%, 80%, and 90% respectively for the routing protocol AODV . Figures 6 and 7 show the effect of the support s on the ratio with ? = 02 and 03 sec respectively for the routing protocol AODV . Figures 8, 9 and 10 show the effect of the time interval ? on the Correlation?ratio with s = 70%, 80% and 90% respectively for the rout- ing protocol DSDV . Figures 11 and 12 show the effect of the support s on the ratio with ? = 02 and 03 sec respectively for the routing protocol DSDV . Figures 13, 14 and 15 show the effect of the time interval ? on the Correlation?ratio with s = 70%, 80% and 90% re- spectively for the routing protocol DSR. Figures 16 and 17 show the effect of the support s on the ratio with ? = 02 and 03 sec respectively for the routing protocol DSR.

The figures bring out high Correlation-ratios for the proto- cols especially for the protocol DSDV which has higher Correlation?ratio.

5 Conclusions and Future Work  Despite the high mobility of the nodes in (up to 50 m/sec) the proposed framework is still able to discover the hid- den relations among nodes and proves that the traffic of MANET is a raw material for mining. This work is a basis for different algorithms in MANET such as routing proto- cols, security, power conservation, etc. Figure 2 give the position of MANET mining in the Ad Hoc stack.

The layers above the MAC layer may get benefit , either directly or by the cross layer, from the proactive MANET mining results at any time with very reasonable storage-cost (bit-wise), and with free of traffic-cost. Also the off-the- shelf data mining techniques come into the picture to save the computation-cost.
