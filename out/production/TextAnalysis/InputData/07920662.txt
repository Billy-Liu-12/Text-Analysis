Abstract?Terrorism is a matter of great concern in many  nations because of its impact on sustainable development, which is  critical for developing countries. Efforts on the part of security  agencies need to stay a  step ahead of threats of terrorism to  effectively prevent their occurrence. Many research efforts that  sought to combat terrorism using big data have been reported  in the literature. However, most of them have targeted data from  only one type of social media per time. This paper proposes a  model that harnesses data from multiple social media sources in  order to detect terrorist activities by using Apache Spark  technology for implementation. This paper describes the Social  Media Analysis for Combating Terrorism (SMACT) model as a  plausible approach that leverages Big Data analytics to address  terrorism problems in developing nations. SMACT is further  illustrated by a practical use case from the Nigerian context in  order to depict its viability as a potential panacea for handling  terrorism threats.

I. INTRODUCTION  Terrorism is a subject that has gained global attention because of its prevalence in developing countries and its negative impact on the economy. In 2014, about 32,658 people lost their lives through terrorist attacks, which occurred mainly (80%) in five countries: Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nigeria and Syria [1]. According to the report, thirteen (13) countries, which are all developing countries have been identified as having potential for high terrorist activities. They are Angola, Burundi, Bangladesh, Central African Republic, Ethiopia, Cote d?Ivoire, Iran, Uganda, Mali, Myanmar, Mexico, Sri Lanka and Nigeria.

Innocent people are the worst hit during terrorist attacks.

Terror spreads fear and is responsible for  the  gravest violations of human rights and as a result,  terrorism  must never be tolerated nor justified. It must be prevented and combated [2].

The purpose of this paper is to present how big data can be used to prevent and combat terrorism in developing countries.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2       presents the background, Section 3 reviews various use cases of application of big data in terrorism detection and prevention Section 4 presents the methodology and Section 5 concludes the paper.



II. BACKGROUND  This section gives an overview of the key concepts that  relate to terrorism in developing countries.

A. Terrorism in Developing Countries  The word ?terrorism? was coined out of French word ?terrorisme?. There has been no universal agreement when it comes to terrorism definition. This is not unconnected to the fact that the term has both political and emotional undertone.

According to [1], terrorism is defined as ?the threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, religious or social goal through fear, coercion or intimidation?.

Terrorism refers to deliberate use of violence to gain social or political objectives usually through intimidation of a larger audience than the immediate target [3]. Terrorist attacks are informed by political concessions through the application of sufficient pressure. However, the motives of terrorists may differ but they often follow similar patterns such as airplane hijacking, threat, kidnapping, bombing, suicide attack and assassination.

Paper [4] put his own definition this way; ?political violence in an asymmetrical conflict that is designed to induce terror and psychic fear through violent victimization and destruction of non-combatant targets? and [5] also defined terrorism as ?the international random murder of defenseless non-combatants, with the intent of instilling fear of mortal danger amidst a civilian population as a strategy designed to advance political ends?  Disparate definitions notwithstanding, some elements such as ?violence?, ?non-state actors?, ?illegal? and ?targets? are common terms used in the definition of terrorism as depicted in Fig. 1 [6].

Figure 1: Common Terms used in Definition of Terrorism      B. Vulnerabilities of Developing Countries to Terrorism  Developing countries have witnessed numerous attacks from the terrorist groups like Al-Shabab, Boko Haram, the Lord?s Resistance Army, the Tamil Tigers Elam of Sri Lamka, Taliban, Al-Qaeda, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), etc. [7] See Fig. 2  A number of factors such as insecure border, poverty, democratization challenges, weak governance, and illegal movement of weapons among others pave way for the growth of terrorism. Some of them are described below:  1) Porous Borders: Porous border is one of the major  challenges to ensuring stability and security in most of the  developing nations. In many of the borders, the presence of  state security is marginal leading to inability of the  government to enforce order within each country?s border.

This gives room to illegal movement of terrorists and weapons  [8].

2) Conflict, Statelessness and Weak Governance:  Civil  and inter-state conflicts, statelessness (in case of Somalia) and  weak governance have become normal experience in  developing countries. All these contribute to poverty,  instability and political isolation, which eventually allows  terrorist exploitation to trigger in such areas [9].

3) Radical Islam: The growth of Islamic extremism has  been associated with poor socio-economic  conditions  prevalent in developing countries where Islamist groups  intentionally leverage socio-economic grievances to penetrate  developing countries. They have exploited various avenues  such as humanitarian, social services, development relief,  training, education, health care among others to improve  standard of living so called on one hand. But, on the hand,  they have also used the same avenues to promote extremism in  those countries [8].

Figure 2: Global Terrorism Index 2015  Source: Institute for Economics & Peace, 2015  C. Potentials  of  Big  Data  in  Preventing  and  Combating Terrorism  Today, not only the developing countries but the entire world is being faced with terrorism and insurgency threat.

Government and security agencies are on their toes looking for ideas and solutions to combat terrorist activity. Big data can provide answers to national security.

There is popular saying that ?you cannot fight the enemy you don?t know?, hence in order to prevent and combat terrorism effectively, it is important to have 360 degree view of terrorists? operations, and the technology used by them.

Nothing gives us better insight than big data.

Just in the same way businesses and organizations employed big data to get deep insight of their customers in order to gain competitive advantage and to be relevant in market, security agencies can leverage on big data to get the understanding of the background, modus operandi, motives and methods of communication of terrorists. Harnessing all these information would give insight into their network, financiers, suppliers, supporters and informants as well as establish patterns to predict the likelihood of their future attack, location, which group of population or what type of person is likely to join terrorist organisation.

In other words, it is possible to confidently predict terrorist activity by combination of observations across various sources such as internet searches, media activity, smart phone location and shopping habits [10].

Extraction of actionable and meaningful insight through big data application will be a key for security agencies in monitoring, preventing and combating terrorist activity.

Successful implementation of big data in terrorism prevention and control can be realized through provision of research and development in web scraping, data crawling, etc. [11].

In addition, in order to prevent and combat terrorism effectively, governments and security agencies must always stay one step ahead of the game. This is where big data comes in. [12].



III. RELATED WORK  The study conducted by [28] analysed samples of terrorists attacks within the time frame 2000-2010 in countries such as Algeria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Algeria, etc. taking into consideration attributes such as date, geo-political zone, city, country   and   region.   The   authors   used   an   exponential  Violence  Illegal Terrorism Non- state  actors  Targets    Data Analysis  distribution model to study intervals between terrorist activities to predict the next attack. They argued that with the information obtained, action plan can be devised to prevent and counter terrorist activities. Paper [30] modeled random effects specification using a Dirichlet process. The model was applied to terrorism data. The method performed better in uncovering latent information that would not otherwise have been revealed.

The work of [13] focused on how to detect changes in context of social network using Time Series Analysis. The authors specifically analysed e-mails and identified changes in frequency of communication with the passage of time. If someone that has no ties with Libya for instance, suddenly starts communicating with someone over there, such a person can be tracked to get more details. With this, terrorists activity can be tracked, which can provide insight to prevent future attack. A face tracking system implemented on video processing framework, which traces continuous movement of faces in a sequence of video frames was presented by [14].

Authors opined that this kind of analysis can be used for criminal investigation such as terrorism. Similarly [29] reported how visual surveillance (CCTV) can be used to counter terrorism. However, this may not be feasible in developing countries due to the incurred overhead.

Paper [15] mined relationship among users from online discussions using sentiment analysis to detect subgroups (set of users having the same opinion) from online discussion by building discussant attitude profiles, then clustered users into subgroup through their profiles. The result was further subjected to probabilistic matrix factorization to derive a low- rank representation from the opinion scores. With this, potential terrorists and supporters can be detected. The work of [16] is also similar. Topic modeling on twitter posts was performed in order to automatically identify discussion topics and thereafter these topics were incorporated into a crime prediction model. The method was compared with kernel density estimation and it was found that topic modelling performed better.

Collection and analysis of open meta big data relating to terrorist activities that spanned over 43 year period (1970 ? 2013) to visually summarize terrorism trends was reported in [17]. The findings are then used for predicting purposes relating to terrorism. A proposal by [18] dwelt on how big data technology can be used to monitor students to predict the likelihood that a student with deviant ideologies may become a potential terrorist by defining a threshold. If student?s behaviour goes above the threshold, such a student will then be closely monitored. The work in [19] proposed a structured framework to harvest civilian sentiment and responses on Twitter during terrorism scenarios to predict potential response to terrorist threats.

From the literature, it was observed that most researches centred on a single type of social media. There has been no research that tried to harvest data from multiple types of social media feeds. In addition, employing an identity discovery module to further strengthen the result of the analysis is a new idea. Last but not the least, the use of big data in combating terrorism has been implemented only in developed countries,  such intelligent solutions have not been utilized in developing nations. All these necessitate this research work.



IV. METHODOLOGY  This section describes the methodology to be adopted for  combating terrorism using big data analytics. First, we  present a bird-eye view of the analytical procedure for  handling Big Data for terrorism detection, second, the  architectural framework, thereafter, a description of key  components of the architecture and lastly, a use case  scenario.

A. Analytical Procedurefor Handling Big Data for Terrorism  The analytical procedure is mainly a four-step procedure  that entails data collection, data preprocessing, deep analysis  and detailed identity investigation (See fig. 3). Each of these  steps is described below:    1) Data Collection: Data stream will be gathered from  web sources such as facebook, Twitter, SMS, e-mail,  WhatsApp, 2go by intelligence units/agencies using a web  scaper tool on a daily basis to Spark Streaming. Spark  Streaming enables handling of cross-platform data sources  because it can accommodate different data stores. It allows  loading of data irrespective of the data format by focussing  on how data will be used instead of how data must be  structured to fit an existing schema.

2) Data Preprocessing: Collected data stream will undergo  cleaning process using a data cleaning tool such as  SampleClean (a scalable data cleaning library that is built on  AMPLab Berkeley Data Analytics Stack), which uses Apache  Spark with Apache Hive for distributed data cleaning.

SampleClean has capability to manage data generated either  from single or multiple data platforms.

Figure 3: Methodology Process  Detailed Identity  Investigation  Data extraction  and filtering  Deep Analysis  Data Preprocessing  Data Collection    3) Deep Analysis: Deep analysis is divided into two stages.

First, the preprocessed data will be filtered using lexicon  based text mining and semantic analyzer for extracting  keyword and related terms. Thereafter, Term  Frequency/Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF),  specifically hashing TF and IDF embedded in Machine  Learning library (MLlib) of Apache Spark will be applied as a  weighting factor of such terms (i.e. terms such as gun, bomb,  bomb blast, pistol, etc.). Second, the extracted data will then  be clustered; for instance, people who originated from country  A and who belong to a suspicious group X may form cluster I;  people who originated from country B and are less than 50  years may form cluster II using Streaming K-means technique  in Apache Spark.

4) Detailed Identity Investigation: The output of deep  analysis is then passed to an identity discovery module, a  module that uses link analysis (a technique that uses graph  theory to detect patterns) to investigate the suspected  terrorists? communication channels, associated phone  numbers, supporters, pictures, financiers, etc. by directly  accessing their twitter handle, facebook account, e-mail  account, etc.

B. Social Media Analytics for Combating Terrorism (SMACT)  Model  The Social Media Analysis for Combating Terrorism (SMACT) model is hereby proposed as the architectural framework for combating terrorism based on big data analytics. SMACT will enable real time analysis of numerous and diverse social media feeds such as Twitter, WhatsApp, e- mail, Facebook, YouTube, 2go, Instagram, etc. from a targeted location. The SMACT model integrates the functionality of the web scrapper tool, the data cleaning, data filtering and deep learning capability of the Apache Spark cluster, and the identity discovery module in order to proactively identify terrorist threats. Operationally, the SMACT crawls data from variant social media sources, cleans and elaborates the data, and allows selected machine learning operations to be performed on the collected data. The output of this analysis is then transferred to the identify discovery module where more detailed analysis (such as communication channels, locations, images/pictures of suspects in order to capture information even when terrorists are external to the mapped out area) is done. Thereafter, the result of the final analysis is transferred to relevant security agencies. An overview of the architecture of the SMACT is presented in Figure 4.

C. Key Components of SMACT Architecture  Web Scraper: Also known as web data extraction or web harvesting, is a tool used for extracting data from various web sources. The web scrapper is responsible for harvesting the content of the social media feed to  Spark  Streaming.

Examples are Webhose.io, Data Toolbar, Free Web Scraper, Add Tolt, Apifier, Easy Web Extract, etc.

Apache Spark: Apache Spark is an open-source cluster computing framework that uses in-memory computation to provide better and faster performance than Hadoop?s disk- based MapReduce paradigm. It supports batch, iterative and real time processing. Apache Spark consist of a set of rich libraries (such as Machine Learning Library for machine learning, spark streaming for streaming data, spark SQL for querying and GraphX for graph processing, providing all-in- one solution) and API methods (such as map, filter, count, reduce, groupByKey, reduceByKey, window, countByWindow, kreduceByWindow, countByValueAndWindow) that can efficiently access data from different sources. Its flexibility to analyse data across different object stores makes it an ideal platform for cross-platform analytics. It plays a unifying framework for accessing and processing data across platforms and technologies for batch and real time processing [20] ? [27]. In SMACT, Apache Spark Streaming collects data from different social media feeds through a web scrapper, handles data preprocessing and filtering of information relating to terrorism. It will also monitor and identifies suspects who are likely to join terrorist organizations, by performing key machine learning procedures such as sentiment analysis and opinion mining.

Identity Discovery Module: This module reinforces the  information about suspected terrorists, their communication  channels, supporters, financiers, people that have the tendency  to become terrorist in future. It harnesses specific information  on suspected terrorists through contents of their Facebook  accounts, twitter handles, e-mail accounts. This is achieved by  going back to the web sources and telecom industries to trace  out specifically the communication channels, location  identification, images/pictures of suspected terrorists.

SecurityAgencies: This comprises Intelligence Communities  working for the government that are charged with the  responsibility of intelligence gathering in order to ensure  national security.

D. Use Case Scenario of SMACT Model  A typical use case of SMACT is if the intelligence  department of Nigeria Police wants to spot potential terrorists  (Boko Haram), sponsors and sympathizers, and locations  within the country. The intelligent Gathering Unit of the  Police Force need not go to particular place such as Sambisa  forest before these can be determined.

With the use of SMACT model, Specific regions or  locations in Nigeria can designated as target locations. Data  stream from social media sources that emanate from these  locations or pertain to them can be collected using Easy Web  Extract (a web scraper tool) and then transferred to Spark  streaming on a daily basis.

The data stream are cleansed using SampleClean tool.

Thereafter, the cleaned data are filtered using HashingTF and  IDF to extract any social media account having the terms for  instance, ?gun?, ?terror?, ?shooting?, ?high jacking?, ?Boko?,    Data  Stream  Cleaning  Data  Stream  Filtering    Deep  Analysis  Telecom  Industry  Identity  Discovery  Module  Security  Agencies  Web  Scraper  Cloud Spark  Cluster  MAPPED  OUT AREA                          Figure 4: Social Media Analytics for Combating Terrorism (SMACT) Model         ?Haram?, ?Boko Haram?, ?bomb?, ?bomb blast? or their  covert synonyms. The related terms can be obtained through  the use of Lex (a lexical analyzer generator designed for  lexical processing of character input stream).

All the accounts having these terrorism related contents  are then clustered using Streaming K-means technique  embedded in Apache Spark so that  individuals  with  common characteristics and behaviour can be grouped  together.

The result of the query (twitter handle, Facebook  account, e-mail account, etc.) are then passed to the Identity  Discovery module where information (such as  communication channels, location, associated phone  numbers, pictures, sponsors, supporters, etc.) about the  specifically suspected terrorists are collected in order to get  concrete information through the use of link analysis. The  result from this stage can then be submitted to security  department of Nigerian police to carry out the necessary  action.



V. CONCLUSION AND FURTHER WORK  The paper has tried to present the state of terrorism in the developing countries starting from definition of terrorism to vulnerabilities to terrorist attacks. It also  argued  the potential of big data to prevent and combat terrorism through the use of insight embedded in various forms of communication among terrorists, sponsors and sympathizers via variant social media sources.

In contrast to previous works, which have focused largely on analytics of data from single sources to combat terrorism, this paper presents a model that can handle social media data from many diverse sources. The approach is also discussed with reference to developing nations, which is not common in extant literature.

In this paper, a use case of Social Media Analysis for Combating Terrorism (SMACT) Model was also presented in order to demonstrate the plausibility of its implementation to solve real security problems that relates to terrorism. In future work, the implementation and evaluation of the SMACT model will be pursued. In addition, other vital aspects such as geo-spatial analysis will also be incorporated into SMACT model in order to achieve a more robust security scheme that is capable of combating terrorism threats in developing nations.
