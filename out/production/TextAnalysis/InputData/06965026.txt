Disease Forecasting System Using Data Mining Methods

Abstract?The healthcare industry collects large amounts of healthcare information which cannot be mined to find unknown information for efficient evaluation.Discovery of buried patterns frequently goes unexploited. Heart disease is a term for defining a huge amount of healthcare conditions that are related to the heart.

This medicinal condition defines the unpredicted health conditions that directly control all the parts of the heart. Different data mining techniques such as association rule mining, classification, clustering are used to predict the heart disease in health care industry .The heart disease database is preprocessed to make the mining process more efficient. The preprocessed data is clustered using clustering algorithms like K-means to cluster relevant data in database.

Maximal Frequent Itemset Algorithm (MAFIA) is used for mining maximal frequent patterns in heart disease database. The frequent patterns can be classified using C4.5 algorithm as training algorithm using the concept of information entropy. The results showed that the designed prediction system is capable of predicting the heart attack successfully.

I.  INTRODUCTION Data mining is process of extracting useful information from large amount of databases.Data mining is most useful in an exploratory analysis because of nontrivial information in large volumes of data.

The data mining techniques are useful for predicting the various diseases in the medical field. Disease prediction plays an important role in data mining. There are different types of diseases predicting in data mining namely heart diseases, lung cancer and breast cancer.

This paper analyzes the heart disease predictions using classification algorithms. These hidden patterns can be used for health diagnosis in medicinal data. Data mining technology afford an effective approach to latest and indefinite patterns in the data. The information which is identified can be used by the healthcare administrators to get better services. Heart disease was the most important reason of victims in the countries like India, United States. Data mining techniques like Association Rule Mining, Clustering, Classification algorithms such as Decision tree [7], C4.5 algorithm, Neural Network [8], Naive Bayes [9] are used to explore the different kinds of heart based problems [1]. Data mining techniques like C4.5 algorithm and  K-means clustering are used for validating the accuracy of medicinal data. These algorithms can be used to optimize the data storage for practical and legal purposes.



II. RELATED   WORK The data mining techniques includes different works to explore a variety of diseases such as Cancer, Diabetes, Heart diseases. Heart disease is the most important reason of fatality in the UK, USA, Canada, and England [2]. Heart disease kills individual in each 32 seconds in the world. Jyoti Soni et al proposed three different supervised machine learning algorithms for heart disease prediction. They are Na?ve Bayes, K-nearest neighbor, and Decision tree. These algorithms have been used for analyzing the heart disease. Tanagra is the data mining tool used for classifying these medical data and these data are calculated using 10 fold cross validation. Naive Bayes algorithm performs well when compared to other algorithms [3].

Genetic algorithm have been used in [6], to reduce the definite data size to obtain the best possible subset of attribute which is essential for heart disease prediction. Classification is supervised learning method to extract models relating main classes of data. Decision Tree, Na?ve Bayes and Classification via clustering are the three classifiers used to analyze the occurrence of heart disease for the patients. Shekar et al proposed new algorithm to mine association rules from medical data based on digit sequence and clustering for heart attack prediction the entire data base is divided into partitions of equal size, each partition will be called cluster. This approach reduces main memory requirement since it consider only a small cluster at a time and it is scalable and efficient [5].



III. MATERIALS AND METHODS  A. Data Preprocessing Cleaning and filtering of the data might be necessarily carried out with respect to the data and data mining algorithm employed so as to avoid the creation of deceptive or inappropriate rules or patterns. In preprocessing first it selects an attribute for selecting a subset of attributes with good predicting capability. It handles all missing values and investigates each possibility. If an attribute has more than 5% missing values then the records should not be deleted and it is advisable to impute values where data is missing, using a suitable method.

DOI 10.1109/ICICA.2014.36     B. K-means Clustering Grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group is more similar to each other than to those in other groups. Clustering is an unsupervised learning. The algorithm clusters information?s into k groups, where k is considered as an input parameter. Next it assigns each information?s to clusters based upon the observation?s proximity to the mean of the cluster. The cluster?s mean is then more computed and the process will continue again. The k-means algorithm is one of the simplest clustering techniques and it is commonly used in medical imaging and related fields. The steps involved in K- means algorithms are as follows:  - Choose the number of clusters, k.

- Randomly create k clusters and find the cluster  midpoint.

- Consign each point to the closest cluster midpoint - Recompute the new cluster midpoints.

- Iterate the above two steps until various convergence  condition is met.

The preprocessed data is clustered using k-means to cluster relevant data in the heart disease database shown in Table I.K- means algorithm produces a specific number of separate, non- hierarchical clusters. It is a simplest algorithm and performs faster than other clustering algorithms. It allows run on huge databases. It is mainly suitable for globular clusters.

C. MAFIA The association rule mining problem is a main predicament in the data mining field with various realistic applications such as user medical data analysis, intrusion detection.

MAFIA is used for mining maximal frequent item sets from a transactional database [4]. This algorithm is mainly efficient when the item sets in the database are very long. The search strategy of this algorithm integrates a depth-first traversal of the item set lattice with efficient pruning mechanisms. A ? I an item set, and call A a k-item set if the cardinality of item set A is k. Let database X be a multiset of subsets of I, and let support (A) be the fraction of item sets B in X such that A ? B.If support(A)=minSup, then A is a frequent item set, and indicate the set of all Frequent Item sets(MFI) by FI. If A is recurrent and no superset of A is frequent, then A is a Maximally Frequent Item set, and denotes the set of all Maximally Frequent Item sets by MFI.

MAFIA efficiently stores the transactional database as a series of vertical bitmaps, where each bitmap represents an item set in the database and a bit in each bitmap represents whether or a given customer has the corresponding item set. Initially, each bitmap represents an item set in database. The item sets that are checked for frequency in the database become recursively longer and the vertical bitmap representation works perfectly in conjunction with this item set extension.

D. C4.5 Algorithm Classification is an unsupervised learning used to predict the class of objects whose class label is unknown. It is used for creating classification rules by means of decision trees from a given data set.

Decision tree is used as a prognostic model. C4.5, C5.0, CART, ID3 are methods for building decision trees. It is an extension of the basic ID3 algorithm. By using C4.5, decision trees can be building from a set of training data with the information entropy. It is a statistical classifier. It outputs can be in the form of if then rules  A.Sample Algorithm   - Test for base cases.

- For  each  element  n,determine  the  normalized  information gain from separating on n.

o Let n_best be the element with the highest  normalized information gain - Construct a decision node that breaks on a best.

- Recur on the sublists found by separating on  n_best, and attach these nodes as children of node.

V.  EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS The result of experimental analysis in identifying important patterns for predicting heart diseases are presented in this section. The heart disease database is preprocessed effectively by removing related records and given that missing values .The well mannered heart disease data set[10], resulting from preprocessing, is then composed by K-means algorithm with the K value of 2.Then the frequent forms are mined efficiently from the set appropriate to heart disease, using the MAFIA .
