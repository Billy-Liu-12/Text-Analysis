Index Miner  I-Jen Chiang T.Y.Lin

Abstract Index Miner is a Java-based data mining tool, which contains the methodologies of classification, clustering, association rules, visualization, attribute transformation and feature selection. The paper briefly introduces this tool and discusses the methods that are implemented in this tool to show how to create and perform a learning process for a data in order the mining the patterns hidden in the data.

1. INTRODUCTION  There is no algorithm that is most adaptive to all tasks.

Therefore, we develop a data mining tool containing some well-known algorithms of different kinds of applications, such as classifications, clustering, association rules, visualization, attribute transformations and feature selections.

Index Miner is a generic data mining tool that provide users a large learning algorithms to analyze their problems with high volume data. There are more than one hundred machine learning algorithms that cover classification, clustering, association rules, and feature selections implemented in this tool. It is convenient for users to build up a flow to do a learning process, i.e., users load the proper database, and filter some irrelevant attributes by using feature selection mechanisms or make data segmentation by clustering mechanisms, and then use a classifier to classify the data or association rules finding mechanism to generate all important association rules.

The goal of Index Miner is the same as MLC++[l] and Weka [2] project. The Index Miner is not only the data mining tool but also provides the utilities for the researchers to analyze their data and easy to build up their own learning algorithms. The performance statistics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and others are included in Index Miner.

This paper will generally give an outline of Index Miner. In the next section, we will review all the methods that are implemented in Index Miner. The future work of Index Miner will be listed in the last section.

2. METHODS IN INDEX MINER  This framework is implemented in Java programming language. There are more than one hundred algorithms that have been implemented in Index Miner. It covers almost all the functions of data mining, e.g., classifications, clustering, association rules, and feature transformations and feature  selections. Users can create a learning procedure (as shown in Figure.1) for the data that they want to analyze. Users can follow the procedure to perform their learning schemes.

For classifications, Index Miner provides three kinds of classifiers for classify the data. The category classifiers are only suitable for making category data type classes prediction. There are C4.5, CN2, CHAID, support vector machine, logistic regression, Bayesian classifiers, Ada Boosting, and so on. The numerical classifiers are proper for the numerical type data classes analyzing. IBk, linear regression, and etc., are the numerical classifiers. Some classifiers, such as CART, are adapt to both kinds of data types.

Feature selections that are also called attribute selections are to filter some attributes that are thought unimportant for the other data mining processes. Under certain tolerated criteria, we can ignore these attributes. In general, forward look-ahead methods and backward look-after methods are treated as the core technique for making attribute selections.

Wrapper, Relief and some others are implemented in Index Miner.

Affinity groups is also called Market Basket Analysis and usually used to determine which things to go together.

With Affinity Groups analysis, association rules are generated to identify cross-selling opportunities and design attractive marketing packages or groupings of product and services. A priori and granular computing are implemented in Index Miner.

Clustering is one major data mining task segmenting a heterogeneous population into a number of more homogeneous subgroups (clusters), which are grouped together on the basis of self-similarity. There are three clustering algorithms are implemented in Index Miner. One is k-neighborhood algorithm, another is EM algorithm and the other is COWEB. Users can select the most proper algorithms to make a data segmentation. The result of the  613 0-7695-1372-7101 $10.00 0 2001 IEEE  mailto:cs.sjsu.edu   clustering can pass to the classifiers and association rules finders for further analyzing.

Besides, the methods of classifications, clustering, association rules, and feature selections, attribute adjustment methods are in this tool to create or remove a novel attribute for making further learning.

3. CONCLUSION  Index Miner provides many machine learning algorithms for data analysis. The users can easy create their learning flows. However, some facilities such as 3D visualization are missed in this package. In addition to add more learning algorithms in it, we will build up fancy visualization tools.
