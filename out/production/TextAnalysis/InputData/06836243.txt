Development of Attitude Control Systems for Modular

Abstract - This paper discusses a new approach to ADCS simulation and design that is consistent with applications based  software components. By breaking the ADCS into component  applications and using standard interfaces, both of which  having been pre-defined in coordination with the software  development team, a new paradigm in the development of  ADCS software has been achieved. In order to meet quick  development times and reduce development costs, this new  paradigm relies on modular, reusable software applications  implemented in a network architecture. These systems use  data driven, asynchronous applications to provide the various  software functions, including ADCS. By keeping the  applications self-contained, the software can be modified by  changing, adding, deleting or modifying an application without  affecting the rest of the software, thereby reducing the test  requirements on the system. However, this modular approach  is not consistent with traditional ADCS development  approaches and environments, which assume that all ADCS  functions will be contained in a single block of software,  executed in a single thread at a precise sample frequency. This  leads to difficulties in translating the algorithms developed by  the ADCS algorithm team to into flight software, either  through documentation that is passed to the software team, or  through autocoding of the algorithms directly. We will discuss  the implementation of a general applications based ADCS  simulation operating in the MATLAB environment as well as  the development of algorithms for spacecraft requiring  multiple pointing modes, the aggregation of multiple sensor  inputs and the precise tracking of ground targets.
