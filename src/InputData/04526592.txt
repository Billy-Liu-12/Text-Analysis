Abstract?This paper describes a software system designed for the support of future autonomous space missions by providing an infrastructure for runtime monitoring, analysis, and feedback. The objective of this research is to make mission software executing on parallel on-board architectures fault tolerant through an introspection mechanism that provides automatic recovery minimizing the loss of function and data.  Such architectures are essential for future JPL missions because of their increased need for autonomy along with enhanced on-board computational capabilities  while in deep space or time-critical situations.
