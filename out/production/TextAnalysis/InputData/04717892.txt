Abstract?Most of available web filters especially parental  controls work inline meaning that all outgoing and incoming packets are passed through a filter driver. This approach widely used in parental control applications because they mostly use blacklist, whitelist approach and defense of the applications to bypass the filter easily. Online content filtering along with its own benefits has a big flaw; filtering process affects data transfer throughput. Also this method suffers from being poor to analyze HTTP/HTTPS traffic like html reconstruction, HTML encoding, object analysis, text classifying, image analysis, analyzing HTTPS. Online content filtering is not effective if network traffic is encrypted and cannot be decrypted by the online content filter or more generally, if the traffic is in a form that the online content filter cannot interpret correctly. One of the other disadvantages identified in this work was: packet filter doesn't analyze the contents of a packet; it decides whether to pass it based on the packets addressing information.

Accelerating content filtering by only examining Web content is major method used. This architecture proposed in this work use offline filtering and proxy as a synergistic approach. By this way filtering process and data transfer acts independently. This work presents a simple, but effective framework to accelerate the filtering process by examining only part of the Web content. The framework can make the filtering decision, either to block or to pass the Web content. The proposed framework can be used as a gateway, as an agent based content filter or a parental control framework..

I. INTRODUCTION assive volume of Internet content is widely accessible nowadays. One can easily view improper content at will  without access control. For example,an employee may watch stock information during office hours. Web filtering products can enforce the access control. The up-to-date products have widely adopted content analysis besides the URL-based approach [1]. Content analysis works with the URL-based approach to relieve the efforts of maintaining the URL list and   Ertu?rul Akba? is with Hakem Bili?im, ?stanbul, TR (corresponding author to provide phone: 90-533-7220060; fax: 216-3900954; e-mail:eakbas @ gmail.com).

to reduce the number of false negatives. The analysis classifies the Web content to a certain category first, and makes the filtering decision, either to block or to pass the content.

Despite the ongoing research on image and video content classification, text classification is typically the most efficient approach to Web content analysis. Many text classification algorithms have been around with high accuracy. They are often assumed to run off-line, so their execution time is rarely discussed. However, the efficiency of these algorithms is critical because slow content analysis in Web filtering incurs long user response time. The issues of accelerating the analysis should deserve attention  This work presents a simple, but effective framework to accelerate the filtering from the observation that the filtering decision can be made parallel scanning the entire content, as soon as the URL can be classified into a certain category and content can be also be classified into a certain category by proxy. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II provides the architecture of this work. The synergistic approach is described in Section III. Section IV exhibits the accuracy and efficiency of this algorithm from the experimental results and discusses the deployment issues in a practical environment. Section V gives implementation details. Finally, Section VI concludes this work.



II. ARCHITECTURE The architecture introduced in this section enables high  performance and highly accurate framework for content filtering. Next Generation Filtering framework consists of 2 parallel processing modules. The first one is offline streaming module, the second one is content analyzing proxy. The power of offline streaming module comes from:  1. Early decision algorithm 2. Self defensive behavior of bypassing content filters  especially proxy servers.[2,3] 3. Supporting proxy features on parental control products.

4. URL filtering 1. URL filtering 2. HTTP protocol analyzing 3. HTTPS protocol analyzing 4. HTML reconstruction 5.

Textual ? Links ? Image ? Profile   Next generation filtering is proxy based but uses a packet  filter to preprocess the packet stream and improve processing performance and being prune to bypass attempts. Being prune to bypass attempts is especially important on parental control versions of content filtering because parents are not aware of their children are not using filters etc..



III. NEXT GENERATION FRAMEWORK The philosophy behind the next generation filtering  framework is to make the filtering decision parallel and fast as well as prune to bypassing proxy servers and bring proxy server capabilities to parental control solutions. Since offline  network traffic analyzing and content filtering through proxy done in parallel this framework does not suffers from slow response time.

Offline streaming steps:  1. Capture packets 2. Distinguish IP packets.

3. Look for a 'GET /' in the first four bytes of data.If not found continue with next captured packet.

4. Look for a host ' in the payload of this packet.If found match over URL blacklist 5. Perform a boyer-moore [6] pattern match over data against blacklist keywords.If not found continue with next captured packet.

6. Send a TCP reset to server and a block page to client.

This module can be used on the same machine with proxy or can be distributed to the agent if gateway based proxy used.

Parental control solution is a special case of agent based content filter.

Proxy server Web content analyzing steps:  1. Search on URL whitelist 2. Search on URL blacklist 3. Search content a. Search on links b. Text search c. Object analysis d. Web page analysis 4. Decoding web content including SSL based protocols.

During content analyzing HTML reconstruction, HTML encoding and also HTTPS decoding also supported by the framework and implemented for test. Also if you want a complete content analyzing framework including multimedia content tunings is a must [8].The relationship between accuracy, resource and performance is shown in Figure 1.As can be seen, the higher the accuracy, the more resource is needed and the slower the performance.

By synergetic integration of offline stream analysis and Proxy server capabilities also increase accuracy and drops requirement for resources because resources are the critical part of content filtering commercial applications.

One of the main advantages of this architecture is being suitable for both gateway based and distributed architecture. If gateway based architecture preferred offline streaming module must be installed to each client parental control solution is a special configuration of single machine based next generation filtering architecture.

Next generation filtering engine can be operated in a two modes - coupled and decoupled - depending on whether the proxy server and offline streaming run on the same or different machines. The two modes provide a convenient method of controlling the tradeoff between flexibility and performance of the filter engine.

If we can list the requirement from the point of view of an  end user [7]  1. Hardware/Software compatibility: Will the filtering  software be installed on each individual computer (i.e.,client) or on a central computer (i.e.,server)? Does the filtering software require you to have additional software?

2. Cost: Are there any ongoing fees associated with updating the blacklist? Are there separate installation fees?

3. Ease of installation and maintenance: Does the company install the software for you? How frequently does it need to be updated, modified, etc.? How difficult is it to add/remove computers?

4. Monitoring and reporting capabilities: What statistics are kept and how can they be accessed? Are there standard ready- made reports that you need?

5. Effectiveness of filtering technology: How frequently are blacklists/whitelists updated? Does the filter have the ability to dynamically classify a site, even when that site has not already been placed on a blacklist/whitelist?

6. Configuration Options: Can different computers be configured differently? How many blocking categories (e.g.,pornography, gambling, hate, web chat) are offered ,and are they categories that correspond with the libraries policies?

7. Error handling capabilities: How difficult is it to turn on or off the filter for a given computer? Can custom messages be displayed when a site is blocked? How difficult is it to add a site to or remove it from a whitelist or blacklist? Who can initiate such a procedure?

Since end user point of view also considers as much as resources and cost also Next generation filtering engine also offers a solution to fulfill end user requirements because this framework brings server capability also to parental control applications which means client solutions.



IV. EXPERIMENTS Totally 4449 Web pages are randomly collected from the  Google search [8] for the experiment in four typically banned categories: Pornography, Game, Online-Shopping and  Finance. Table 1 depicts blocking rates. 1,655 of them are clear.

Table I: Next Generation Filtering Framework (NGF) Blocking Rates.

Game Shopping Porn F  Finance  89% 95% 100% 87%  Performance of a filtering system can be measured in terms of blocking rate which is the percentage of the correctly blocked Web pages, and over-blocking rate which is the percentage of legitimate pages that are blocked. The Netprotect project evaluated 50 commercially available filtering systems using 2,794 URLs with pornographic content and 1,655 URLs with normal content [10]. Their results reproduced in Table 2 show that the accuracy of existing systems is far from satisfactory. We have conducted the same tests with Netprotect with same number of adult URLs and same number of normal content. We added next  generation filtering to this table additionally in order to be comparable.

Blocking rate=  Over Blocking Rate =   Another comparison has done by department of Informatic  Networks, Turk Telekom. Turk Telekom is the biggest telecom operator in Turkey and also one of the biggest operators in the world. The results are also very satisfactory.

They compared next generation filtering framework (NGF) with Net Nany (Formerly Content Watch) and Aile Koruma ?ifresi. The results depicted in table 2.

V. IMPLEMENTATION We implemented the proposed Web filtering module in Java  1.6 and used jpcap [11] based offline filtering module. Proxy module also developed using java [12].We collected Web pages from google [8] and used them to test our filtering system. The experimental results have been very encouraging.



VI. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we have described a content filtering framework that combines offline packet analysis and a special proxy engine. We compared our approaches with previous researchers and commercially available products and found the experimental results to be encouraging. We believe that the proposed approaches are useful for  1-Fast early decision 2-Accelerate Proxy 3-Brings proxy features to parental control application with being prune to bypass attempts 4-Offline decision support which means do not affect throughput 5-Deep HTTP/HTTPS analyze capability.

6-Highly Distributed 7-Platform independent   Finally, advantage of the synergistic integration of packet filtering and advanced proxy engine is being prune to Circumvention.

A user may circumvent a filter in order to access the internet without restriction [15]. Circumvention of filtering and/or blocking technologies is an important issue [15].The ease with which filters may be circumvented will depend on the technical knowledge of the user and possible methods of circumvention will vary according to the location in which the filter has been deployed.
