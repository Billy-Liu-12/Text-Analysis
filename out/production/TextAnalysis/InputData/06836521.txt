A Geosynchronous Orbit Optical Communications Relay

Abstract- NASA is planning to fly a Next Generation Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS) next decade. While  the requirements and architecture for that satellite are  unknown at this time, NASA is investing in communications  technologies that could be deployed on the satellite to provide  new communications services. One of those new technologies is  optical communications. The Laser Communications Relay  Demonstration (LCRD) project, scheduled for launch in  December 2017 as a hosted payload on a commercial communications satellite, is a critical pathfinder towards  NASA providing optical communications services on the Next  Generation TDRS. While it is obvious that a small to medium  sized optical communications terminal could be flown on a  GEO satellite to provide support to Near Earth missions, it is  also possible to deploy a large terminal on the satellite to  support Deep Space missions. On board data processing and  Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) are two additional  technologies that could be used to optimize optical  communications link services and enable additional mission  and network operations. This paper provides a possible  architecture for the optical communications augmentation of a  Next Generation TDRS and touches on the critical technology  work currently being done at NASA. It will also describe the  impact of clouds on such an architecture and possible  mitigation techniques.
