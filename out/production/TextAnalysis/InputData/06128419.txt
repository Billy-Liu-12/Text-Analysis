Determining the Influence of Visual Training on EEG  Activity Patterns Using Association Rule Mining

Abstract?To confirm that visual training can change EEG patterns by association rule mining method, firstly, we collected the EEG of people who are under a long-term visual professional training (visual training group) and novice people (control group) during a specific mental tasks. Secondly, we determined the difference of brain electrical activity between the two groups using machine learning methods. Thirdly, we discovered distinct patterns using association rule algorithm, finding that the two groups were separable based on their completion of visual professional cognitive tasks. In the beta band, visual training group showed a specific and significant association pattern which included FP1 and C4. The results indicate that the EEG patterns were modified because of visual professional training. We further discuss the impact of long-term visual professional training on the EEG.

I.  INTRODUCTION Cognitive Neuroscience shows that learning and training  have an important effect on brain development as manifested through brain plasticity. Studying the impact of professional training on brain function is not only important for understanding physiological changes, but also provides a scientific basis for targeted mental development and personnel training. Many researchers have been studying professional training and its impact on brain development using different techniques, such as the EEG, fMRI, PET etc. These studies have found that there is a change of signal rhythm in the corresponding brain areas due to different brain functions led by long-term professional development skills training [1-4]. Our previous study on the high classification results of different majors in EEG has shown that people have a unique pattern of EEG in particular mental tasks after a long period of  professional training, that is the direct reflection of the different patterns of human brain development under professional training [5]. On the basis of this study, a further study is justified to identify the internal differences in brain signals of different cortical areas, between professional training groups and an appropriate control.

Visual-spatial ability is one of the basic functions of the human brain. Through specific training, it can be highly devleloped, and the corresponding cortical structures can be affected. Results of fMRI and PET studies show that visual- spatial ability corresponds to the frontal region of the temporal lobe [6]. Compared with controls, people who have fine arts training typically exhibit significant changes in the frontal area.

EEG studies have shown that brain electrical activity in visual- spatial functional areas have changes associated with training, reflecting an increase in low frequency oscillations in the frontal region, and an alpha band decrease [7-8]. But the observed is somewhat limited, since a comparison was only made in static regions and brain activity patterns during cognitive task performance, and only a single region or parameter was compared. It is likely that multi-regional and multi-parameter studies will yield the best results. However, with an increase in the scale and quantity of data being analysed, the mining of brain activity pattern of cognitive function will be a requirement.

In this paper, we examine the EEG changes produced by the brain when it participants perform visual cognitive tasks following visual professional training. We compared the performance of an experimental group who received visual professional training, to a control group, and analysed the differences in their EEG, using machine learning methods including association rule mining.

II. EXPERIMENT DESIGN  A. Subjects selection We selected four college students with Art & Design  majors as the experimental group, who are typically good professional painters, and eight college students from other major as a control group. Two majors were selected to ensure that the professional characteristics of the control group did not impact on the experimental results. Subjects were right-handed, good healthy and without history of mental illness. Their average age was 23, and they were half male and half female.

All agreed to participate in the experiment voluntarily.

B. Visual professional cognitive task design There were six sisual professional cognitive tasks including  (1) imagining designing a house, including the spatial structure of the house, including shape, color and the position of furniture; and (2) imagining or designing a statue, including the shape, color, etc.

C. Data collection method We use the VEEG 3.0 software to analyze signals, while  setting the low-pass filter as 30Hz and high-pass filter as 0.5Hz. The sampling frequrency was 512Hz. The experiment used a 19-lead electrode cap to collect EEG signals according to the international standard 10-20 system (as shown in Figure 1). All electrodes were referenced to linked earlobes. During the experiment, subjects were required to keep their eyes fixated to reduce eye-movements, and to minimise any external interference on signal acquisition.

Figure 1. International standard 10-20 system for 19- lead placement  D. Experiment All the six tasks require subjects close their eyes. We used a  simple block design method: firstly, subjects were required to completely relax with eyes closed for 2 minutes, and then under guidance (with eyes closed) to imagine different scenarios. The duration of each task was 1 minute. There was 1 minute for subjects to relax between tasks.



III. DATA ANALYSIS  A. Feature Extraction of EEG The alpha wave is a common indicator of electrical activity  in the cerebral cortex during the awake and resting state, and is most prominent in the occipital and parietal occipital lobes.

When a person opens their eyes, the alpha wave changes significantly. The beta wave reflects activity while the cerebral cortex is in a state of focused attention or heightened emotion, and is more obvious in the frontal and parietal lobes. When somoeone opens their eyes or processes some information, the beta wave will appear. In this study, the power characteristics of the three bands from 19 leads were extracted using the Fourier transform (alpha1, alpha2, and beta). The number of variables in the data set was 20, being the EEG power characteristics from 19 electrodes, and a class label, i.e., belong to the visual training group or the control group.

B. Data pattern classification algorithm To recognise discriminating patterns in the EEG, it may be  possible to use many machine learning classification algorithms, such as backpropagation neural networks which are highly adaptive. Using backpropagation typically achieves good classification results for small samples. It uses the error back propagation training algorithm, and operates in two phases: the first phase (the feed-forward process) sees the information from the input layer fed through the hidden layer, where the the output value of each unit is computed; the second phase (the error-propagation process) computes the output error, and the corresponding weights in the hidden layer are adjusted. We use 10-fold cross validation to provide generalisable results from testing, where the same data set is used for selecting cases for training.

C. Association rule discovery algorithm As an important branch of data mining, the aim of  association rules discovery is mining interesting rules among the different attributes of a dataset. Class association rules (CAR) are a special subset of association rules, since the right attribute is limited to a class. Using CARs, we aim to identify the hidden rules between attributes and classes[9]. With the EEG data, we want to discover any interesting association patterns between the properties of all brain areas and professional classes. Two important parameters in CARs are support and confidence in the algorithm.

Suppose D is a data set, Y is the set of all classes set, and I is all of the property values, and d is one of the samples, with a set of attribute values and a class. A CAR is with "condset => Y" form, which condset I, and y Y. The number of d is condsupCount. The number of d which the class attribute values for y is rulesupCount. Suppor =(rulesupCotmt D)*100  , confidence =(rulesupCount condsupCount)*100 . The minsup is the minimum support threshold, minconf is the minimum confidence threshold. If suppor>= minsup and confidence>= minimum, then the rule matches our criterion for selection.

There is a potential problem with support in data mining. If the support threshold is set too high, we may miss some     important rules. If it is set too low, there will be a large number of meaningless rules. We compare the results of several experiments identify the best trade-off between low and high support thresholds.

In this study, we use the CBA software package [10] for EEG data mining.



IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND ANALYSIS  A. Experimental group and control group classification The data set included 240 samples: 80 samples were from  the experimental group, 160 samples were from the control group. We extracted the power spectrum of 3 band values for the 19 leads for each sample data as the signal features, amd then used the backpropagation neural network to classify them.

In the visual professional recognition task, the classification results of each band value of the 19 leads EEG data are shown in Table 1.

TABLE I. Classification result by BP neural network Band Classification Accuracy Rate  alpha1 71.55%  alpha2 80.75%  beta 89.12%  The results of classification accuracy rate show that in visual cognitive tasks, the performance of the visual training group and the control group is different. The alpha1 and alpha2 bands were quite weak, but the beta band was approximately 90%. This indicates that the impact of visual professional training was greatest on the beta wave. Overall, through visual training, we can see quite distinct patterns of separable brain electrical activity.

B. EEG activity pattern discovery of the experimental group In the cognitive tasks, we use association rule mining  method to mining EEG rules of different bands. When minsup=20%, minimum=80%, the two group have EEG patterns with their own characteristics. Removing invalid rules, the effective rules are shown in Table 2. The results are further described below:  TABLE II. minsup=20%, minimum =80% rules of discovery  Band Association Rule Power Range of Leads Unit W  alpha1  {FP2  F3  C4}==> ?0? 464.79<FP2<=472.237  626.889<F3 487.368<C4<=699.647  {FP1  FP2  C3}==> ?0? 626.002<FP1<=630.141 464.79<FP2<=472.237  800.604<C3  {F3  F4  C3}==> ?0? 615.888<F3<=626.889  F4<=461.742 731.011<C3<=792.871  alpha2  {FP2  F4  PZ }==> ?0?

FP1<=2976.055 3422.273<C4<=4185.909  { F4  C3 }==>?0? F4<=2839.781 3013.991<C3<=4096.839  { FP2  F4 }==>?0? 4220.961<FP2 F4<=2839.781  Note: "1" : the visual training group, "0" : the control group  1) The results from the data mining showed that the performance of the visual training and the control groups was significantly different through their distinct association patterns. In the beta band, the visual training group showed a significant and specific association pattern : {FP1 C4 }==>"1", that is when the FP1 <= 2976.055 & 3422.273 <C4 <= 4185.909, the class of subject belonged to the visual training group, that is more than 88.88% reliable. This shows that visual training can indeed change EEG patterns of different brain areas. In the control group, there were also a lot of rules, indicating that people without professional training may need to mobilize more regions to participate in brain activities.

2) In the rule {FP1 C4 }==>" 1 ", FP1 is located in the left prefrontal cortex, C4 is located in the right central area.

According to the results of discrete data, the range of the power level of FP1 and C4 is shown in Table 3, the minimum initial value is determined by the sample data. The italic text mode is the range of characteristic associated with the visual training group. Beta wave activity of the rules is concentrated in the prefrontal cortex and the central area. This is because the frontal area is closely related to high-level thinking activities, while the central area is located at the edge of the frontal lobe.

The power is determined four grades by the size: higher, high, low, lower. So, using FP1 for the lower power and C4 for the higher power, we can represent the effect of visual training on EEG patterns.

TABLE III. THE POWER RANGE OF BRAIN REGIONS IN RULES  FP1 C4  [2823 2976.055  [2903 3391.127  [2976.055 3010.697  [3391.127 3422.273  [3010.697 4047.436  [3422.273 4185..909  [4047.436 4506  [4185..909 4415   CONCLUSION     By using association rule mining, we have found that the EEG patterns from the visual training group and control group are significantly different. This reflects that the long-term professional training will affect the visual development pattern in the human brain. Such differences are not only in different bands but also in different regions, and also in the multi- regional and multi-parameter cooperation in the work pattern.

The physiological mechanisms of the different region, and the reasons that lie behind the observed differences, need to be further investigated. Further studies might also make use of complexity theory in understanding how creativity might have its roots in brain dynamics [11] and the relationship between human cognitive performance and EEG complexity [12, 13].
