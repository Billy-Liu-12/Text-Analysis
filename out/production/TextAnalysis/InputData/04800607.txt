Security Architecture for IEEE 802.15.4-based Wireless Sensor Network

Abstract   A wireless sensor network consists of low power  devices which have limited computing resources. Thus, energy consumption is one of the most significant issues in wireless sensor network environment. For various sensor network applications, security features are also to be a rising big issue more and more. If wireless sensor network supports a variety of security functions, more powerful devices and more energy are required. On the other hand, providing security feature and energy consumption together face a trade-off.

Therefore, in this paper we propose a novel efficient security architecture in IEEE 802.15.4-based wireless sensor network called Hybrid Adaptive Security Framework. The goal of the proposed security framework is to provide hybrid adaptive security suites to each packet according to various WSN considerations.

1. Introduction   Wireless sensor networks with low-power devices have been used as an infrastructure as well as core technology in order to implement ubiquitous computing environment. A variety of rapidly increasing applications of wireless sensor networks are driven by ecological, military, living environment, health and personnel related area. These increasing sensor network applications can sometimes include very sensitive information such as military monitoring and tracking information, personnel related information, and individual health data because of its native characteristic. Moreover, wireless sensor network has a lot of security vulnerabilities because it consists of low computing power and limited resources. Such threats can be classified by network layering architecture such as jamming and tampering in physical layer, collision, exhaustion, unfairness in link layer, spoofed, altered or replays routing information, selective forwarding, sinkhole, and  wormhole in network layer, flooding and de- synchronization in transport layer. Thus, in order to protect sensitive sensing data and security threat, security capabilities in wireless sensor network are strongly required. These security capabilities have seven requirements as follows; availability, authorization, authentication, confidentiality, integrity, non-repudiation, and freshness. However, as we mentioned before, wireless sensor network has inherently resource constrained such as low computation, low memory, short communication range, and low batter life. Specifically, the energy consumption problem continues to remain one of the biggest issues in wireless sensor network for challenge barrier of battery capability. Thus, there is a significant trade-off between providing security functionalities and decreasing energy consumption [1-4].

This paper concentrates on a security approach to solve the contradiction issue in wireless sensor network. The approach is to make a hybrid adaptive security framework which can provide efficient security capabilities considering energy consumption problem. In this paper, we propose a hybrid adaptive security framework and then show use cases and test platform to verify the proposed framework. This paper is structured as follows. An overview and introduction of IEEE 802.15.4/Zigbee and its security schemes are given in the next Section 2. The proposed approach is discussed in Section 3. In Section 4, implementation and performance evaluation are performed. The paper is concluded in Section 5.

2. Background   IEEE 802.15.4 security consists of four kinds of security services such as access control, message integrity, message confidentiality, and replay protection. Access control feature should prevent unauthorized users from participating in the network.

In other word, authorized users can join a legitimated network. The access control is supported by access  user Text Box    control list which includes a variety of security information. Message integrity means the validity of transferred data and message authentication implies message sender?s verification using cryptographic key.

These message integrity and message authentication are guaranteed using message authentication code(MAC) in IEEE 802.15.4. The MAC is appended to each message sent. Also, several security suites are defined in IEEE 802.15.4 security specification. The security suites consists of 8 different security levels, and each level means a kind of cryptographic algorithm, the mode of block cipher, message authentication code, and the size of message authentication code[5-6].

Many researchers have addressed many research areas in wireless sensor network security. Especially, there are a few security architecture researches for providing security features in wireless sensor network.

In case of TinySA[7], it is performed on ?smart-dust? using TinyOS operating system to provide a lightweight security architecture for wireless sensor networks. TinySA consists of a suite of security protocols and cryptographic primitives to ensure confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of communication in a sensor network using ECC(Elliptic Curve Cryptography) algorithm. Tanveer et al. [8], present a cluster formation, secure key management scheme, and a secure routing algorithm to address the special security needs of tiny sensor nodes and sensor networks as a security framework. Neeli et al. [9] present a security concept called adaptive security architecture. The security architecture is divided into low level, medium level, and high level according to application services. The three defined levels of security allow covering the exigencies of every wireless sensor network service. Slijepcevic et al. [10] propose a communication security framework where for each type of data we define a corresponding security mechanism. By employing this multitiered security architecture where each mechanism has different resource requirements, we allow for efficient resource management that is essential for wireless sensor networks. The security level I is reserved for mobile code, as the most sensitive information sent through the network. The security level II is dedicated to the location information conveyed in messages. The security level III mechanism is applied to the application specific information.

3. Security Architecture 3.1. Hybrid Adaptive Security Suite  Security suite is a combination of security operations which is designed to provide security services on MAC frames. As we already discussed in  section 2.2, IEEE 802.15.4 security suite consists of 8 different security levels including symmetric cryptography algorithm, mode, and integrity code bit length. In case of the proposed hybrid adaptive security framework, it provides the security suite as called Hybrid Adaptive Security Suite(HASS) in Table 1 and 2.

Table 1. Hybrid adaptive security suite  Basically, the proposed security suite of Table 1 is  the almost same as IEEE 802.15.4 suite except that it doesn?t have ?no security? suite. However, the most significant point is that the proposed HASS can be dynamically applied to MAC frames according to a characteristic of wireless sensor network. In other words, in this paper, the main contribution of the HASS is to provide flexible and dynamic security capability using HASS decision parameters(as illustrated in Table 2). When a packet is sent or received, an appropriate security suite is decided by various wireless sensor network features such as network and data characteristics. Table 2 describes HASS decision parameters. In case of network characteristics, the features consist of Public, Commercial, and Private. These attributes of network characteristics have a different secrecy by using keys and its length. In other words, ?Public? network attribute means a kind of open network which everybody can connect and it doesn?t guarantee any confidentiality. However, ?Private? network means it needs very strong security requirement because the network can have a high possibility of including sensitive information and network devices.

?Commercial? attribute is located at the middle of the previous two network features. In case of Zigbee network, it has a concept of Trust Center with two kinds of network attributes such as commercial and residential.

Data characteristics of HASS decision table are first divided into application and control attribute.

Application data means a kind of collected data from application services in WSN. Such sensor network application attributes consist of Periodic, Urgent- Periodic, On-Demand, and Event-Driven. Control data means a kind of management signal or message for  HASS#1 HASS  #2 HASS  #3 HASS  #4 HASS  #5 HASS  #6 HASS  #7 Authenti-  cation  O O O O O O  Integrity  O O O O O O  Confident O    O O O MAC Size 0 32 64 128 32 64 128    operating wireless sensor network. For example, a message with security information(Security), routing information(Routing), geometric information(Location), and update code data(OTA) can be included as a control data attribute. Thus, when a packet is sent or received, network characteristic is first considered, and then each network attribute are divided into application and control data features again. After confirming two-tier decision parameters, an appropriate security suite is finally decided.

Hybrid Adaptive Security Framework We present Hybrid Adaptive Security Framework,  security architecture for IEEE 802.15.4-based wireless sensor network that supports adaptive security suite and the related network operations. Figure 1 shows whole architecture of IEEE 802.15.4-based network stack with hybrid adaptive security sublayer. Basically, HASF is based on IEEE 802.15.4 MAC and PHY. In other words, the proposed hybrid adaptive security sublayer(HASS) and security functions are embedded to network and MAC layer, separately. Also, it uses security functions in IEEE 802.15.4 MAC.

In whole network architecture, the HASS consists of hybrid adaptive security block and frame support block.

Hybrid adaptive security block has a responsibility to apply an appropriate security suite to a packet or frame for efficient encryption and decryption operations. It satisfies HASS security properties outlined in Section 3.1 and the hybrid adaptive security block consists of  hybrid adaptive security manager(HASM) and hybrid adaptive security decision engine(HASDE).

Hybrid adaptive security manager(HASM) : When a frame or packet is received to HASM, it performs a kind of a probing process about security related information.

In other words, HASM analyzes hybrid adaptive security suite information, and then performs cryptographic operation.

Hybrid adaptive security decision engine(HASDE) : HASM requests HASS to HASDE. Thus, HASDE receives basic security information from HASM, and then it find out an appropriate HASS level from hybrid adaptive security decision table.

Figure 1. Hybrid adaptive security architecture   Moreover, a frame related support block has two kinds of functions such as frame classification and frame management. Frame classification(FC) module performs the classification operation of received frames from MAC layer. First, FC module receives a frame from MAC, and then checks whether the frame is secured or not. If the frame is unsecured frame, FC sends the frame to an appropriate network module according to network header information. Frame Management(FM) module performs the management operation of received network packets from upper network layer subsystems. First, FM module receives a network packet from an upper layer, and then checks whether the network packet is secured or not. If the network packet is unsecured, FM sends the packet to MAC layer.

4. Implementation 4.1. Performance Analysis and Discussion  In order to analyze the performance of HASS approach, we apply an expected overhead for calculating the size of security header of HASS framework. The expected overhead can be derived of a polynomial equation with a header size and a weighted value as usage frequency. In case of the size of security    header, the default size is 5 byte(frame counter 4bytes and key counter 1byte). Moreover, if HASS uses MAC code to provide message authentication, an added header size can be 4, 8, 16byte, separately. Thus, a possible combination can be 0, 5, 9, 13, 21, and these expected header sizes can be presented as an EOS# called Expected Overhead Size in the equation (1). W# is a coefficient as a weighted value which is the usage frequency of a security capability(suite) combination.

Through controlling weighted coefficient, we can assume the total overhead of HASS like (2). The weighted values of the estimated overhead equation can be changed according to a kind of security policy.

The security policy is not focus in this paper. The applied weighted value of (2) is an experiential result in our experiments. Thus, the derived result can be one of the candidates for HASS based wireless sensor network system, not fixed values.

The weighted value is a kind of control parameter for energy consumption and efficiency. Thus the weighted values are not consistent, but variable for network and its application.

The performance analysis is used AES and RC-5 algorithm based on a sensor node with MSP 430 [13]. In case of MSP 430 micro-controller, it spends 1.26nJ per cycle  and it needs 26 cycle operations per byte. HASS framework has AES-based encryption system and the security overhead of 4.7bytes from the above expected overhead estimation. On the other hands, Crossbow sensor node based on TinySec architecture requires additional 5 bytes security overhead and RC-5 encryption algorithm. Table 3 shows the performance comparison among three kinds of sensor nodes such as IEEE 802.15.4 based system with no security, the proposed HASS system, and Crossbow system with TinySec. We can see that the proposed HASS scheme is better performance than crossbow system.

From these experiment results, the most significant factor is to decrease security header size in order to alleviate an overhead of security processing. Moreover, the performance of crypto algorithms is important, too.

4.2. Implementation In this Section, we introduce our own WSN sensor  node platform, and the real implementation experimental results using the nodes based on the proposed HASS approach. Figure 2 shows H/W prototype of our sensor node with the proposed reliability approach based on IEEE 802.15.4. The prototype consists of chipcon?s CC2420 and MSP 430 component [12]. TI MSP 430 has 16-bit RISC architecture and 12-bit A/D, D/A converter. Radio chip is also TI CC2420 which has operating frequency of 2.4 GHz, transmit bit rate of 250 kbps, and receiver sensitivity of -95 dBm. Moreover, internal memory is 116Kb flash and 8Kb ram and the size of sensor board is 60 x 32 mm. In case of operating system, TinyOS 2.0 is ported and related S/W programs using NesC.

Additionally, 30pin sensor interface and 3V operating voltage(AA battery x2) are used.

Figure 2. IEEE 802.15.4-based Sensor Node  Prototype  In order to present an example of WSN application  using the sensor nodes with HASS framework, we deployed wireless sensor network with various sensors like Figure 3. First, five kinds of sensor nodes are installed in our institute?s office. The sensor nodes have sensing modules such as sound, vibration, motion, photo, and gas. There are also lots of relaying    nodes in office for multi-hop data relaying. If an event is occurred, the collected information is transferred to sink node, and then we can confirm the event information using sensor event analysis tool on the UMPC(Ultra Mobile PC). In this deployment, we could confirm the usability of the proposed HASS framework that reflect network and data features of the office surveillance application through this practical demonstration.

Figure 3. WSN Demonstration with HASS  framework   5. Conclusion   Energy consumption has known as the most significant limitation in wireless sensor network. On the other hand, increasing of various sensor network applications is requesting security features of higher level more and more. However, it is not easy problem to support both limited energy resource and providing security capability in wireless sensor network environment. Thus, in this paper, we have designed a hybrid adaptive security suite framework to solve the trade-off issue between energy and security using applying a flexible security suite to packets dynamically. Base on this idea, we evaluated the proposed approach and compared its performance to IEEE 802.15.4 security scheme and TinySec-based Crossbow product. The experimental results showed that the proposed Hybrid Adaptive Security Framework approach presented better energy efficiency. In case of energy efficiency experiment using expected security overhead, the hybrid adaptive security suite approach shows a slight superior to TinySec-based Crossbow(4.8% versus 5.2%).

However, the small difference is mainly dependent to the result value of the expected overhead calculation.

Thus, energy consumption efficiency can be improved through controlling weighted security header ratio and it can be a kind of near future work.

Moreover, we plan to study on more efficient method to find optimized characteristics of wireless sensor network in order to reduce energy consumption and enhance security capability.
