TEC and Scintillation observed over Ho Chi Minh,  Vietnam during 2009-2012

Abstract  The ionospheric total electron content (TEC) and scintillation (S4) over Ho Chi Minh City (HCM) was studied using the Global Positioning System (GPS). We analyzed GPS data during the recent solar cycle 24 from 2009 to 2012. Some results show that both TEC and scintillation in this area presented the seasonal variations peaking on the equinox months. The vertical TEC observed in HCM is high unusually in spring and autumn equinoxes of 2011 but they seem to agree with solar activity index. The scintillation statistics show that their occurrence is almost at night and the S4 index in this region do not exceed the value of 0.8. GPS TEC was using to compare with IRI-2012 model and found the big gap of TEC in 2011. In latest two years, the high solar activity with lots of flares and Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) were erupted. Two major geomagnetic storms in August 2011 and March 2012 were examined for seeing the changes of TEC and S4 in South Vietnam.

I. INTRODUCTION Ho Chi Minh observatory (10.85N,106.54E) is  located in the equatorial region. We set GSV 4004B receiver in this place and collect data from May 2005 till now to study the total electron content (TEC) and scintillation (S4). Two parameters are important for ionospheric corrections in communications. They effect to satelite tracking and navigational control application [2,4,8].

We are in the recent of solar cycle 24, which started from the beginning of 2009 (fig.1). In this study, we analyzed the variation of TEC and S4 during four recent years to see the effect of Solar activity to those parameters, find the characteristics of TEC and the appearence of S4, and show how TEC and S4 change in the geomagnetic storms.

TEC value was compared with the latest version of the International Reference Ionosphere prediction (IRI-2012) to find the differences of the observed data which the model is still not predicted.

II. DATA ANALYSIS METHOD  A. TEC from GPS receiver  TEC (Total Electron Content) is a measure of the electron number along the path from the satellites to receiver, reported in TEC Units (TECU = electrons?1016m?2). This number is proportional to the ionospheric delay between L1 and L2 signals. The radio signals from GPS on channels L1 (1575.42 MHz) and L2 (1227.6 MHz) will experience difference delays. TEC can be obtained from the ionospheric delay between L1 and L2 signals.

In data processing, we calculated TEC from RINEX file converted from GPS data. Which i jp1  and  i jp2 was  presented in file RINEX, ik  was use in DCB file, download from ftp://ftp.unibe.ch/aiub/CODE [6,7].

B. Scintilation Calculation  Ionospheric Scintillation is a form of rapid phase and amplitude oscillation of sattellite signals due to electron density irregularity caused by ionospheric instability.

The Scintillation Index was calculated by the difference of the total amplitude scintillation index to the 60 sec estimate of signal-to-noise density ( NS ?? ) [1,5].

In processing data, we used Parseismr.exe program to convert GPS file to comma-delimited ASCII  records. S4 calculated by 2 04 44 NT SSS ?=  where  S4T and S4NO were taken directly from the output of ASCII records. We also reject the scintillation by multipath fading and noise plus by choosing the S4 values with Sigma of Code/Carrier Divergence < 0.652*S4-0.125 [7]. S4 value is between 0 and 1, value 1 correspond to about 35dB peak of intensity fluctuations.

C. Geomagnetic storm data Two indexes were used in this report are Kp and Dst  loading from World Data Center for Geomagnetism, Kyoto. http://wdc.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp/index.html.

The disturbance storm time (Dst) index is the average change in the horizontal component of the Earth?s magnetic field, measured in nT, at four low latitude stations. It quantifies the intensity of Magnetic storm.

The minimum Dst value reached is considered as the intensity of the storm.

The planetary geomagnetic (Kp) index shows the effects of Solar wind to the Earth. It is defined on a scale of 0 to 9. The intensity causes storm is from level 5 to 9.

Geomagnetic storm effects to the variation of electron density in the Earth?s atmosphere. TEC will be increased (positive storm phases) or decreased (negative storm phases) during the storms.



III. RESULTS  A.  TEC variations and comparison with IRI prediction   Fig. 2: Monthly peak of GPS TEC (blue columns) with SSN (red line) during 2009-2012  The monthly peak of ionospheric total electron content (TEC) calculated from GPS over HCM in the recently increase of Solar cycle 24 (2009 to 2012) was presented in fig.2. We can see clearly the seasonal variation with maximum in the equinoxes and the minimum in the summer and the winter in every year. GPS TEC here varies depending on the solar activity. The monthly differences are low in solar minimum (2009) and rather high in solar maximum. TEC and SSN are strong agreement especially in 2011 and have a small difference in the summer time of 2012.

GPS TEC observed in HCM was also compared with TEC retrieved from IRI model in latest version (IRI- 2012) during 2009-2012 which presented in fig.3. It is shown that this model agrees well with observed data in low solar activity 2009-2010 but does not catch up with measured data in high solar activity, especially in the equinoxes 2011. The deviation of GPS TEC and IRI TEC was calculated and plot in fig.4. This picture shows a big gap of data in the fall equinox of 2011. The difference is up to 40tecu. This predicted value must be corrected in future.

Scintillation index, S4 Vietnam lies in the equatorial region with the  latitude from 8030?N to 23030?N geographic latitude (0030?N to 15030?N Geomagnetic latitude). Fig.5 shows the number of scintillation happen for the region from 30 to 270. Located at the latitude 10051?N, the scintillation in HCMC rather weak, the intensity is almost under 0.6. Their occurrence is almost at night after 20LT [7].

The variation of monthly S4 values over HCM during four recent years presented in fig.6. In this figure, we see that the higher solar activity made the higher scintillation value as well. The largest values of S4 concentrated on the equinox months (March, April and September, October) especially in years with high solar activity. The monthly averaged S4 values observed in HCM from 2009 to 2012 vary from 0.35 to 0.50. This low GPS scintillation is a specific feature in low latitude region.

Fig. 5: The occurrence of S4 in the Asian Region        Fig. 6: The variation of monthly average S4 values with SSN during 2009-2012  Fig.7 is an overall picture of S4 observed in HCM during 2011. The monthly S4 values and it occurrences were calculated and reckon up to figure.

This figure shows that scintillation occurrence frequently in March, April, September, October, fewer in May and August, and almost rarely happen in remaining months. The highest S4 value is about 0.8 occurred only two times during 2011.

Electric radiation from Solar flares and CME on  the solar surface leads to the Earth?s ionosphere causing Geomagnetic storms. Those storms direct to the increase or decrease electron density in this layer, effect to the electronic system 100km in height. It makes change geomagnetic field, cause electric potential effect in the Earth?s surface and radio  irregularity or disturbances, effect to speed variation of satellites in low height [3].

There are many of geomagnetic storms noted during 2011-2012. It was about 40 solar flares from M to X class with CMEs have Earth-direct partly or total causes geomagnetic storms. Over 2 years, there was about 17 Geomagnetic storms with G1 to G4 levels [13]. Solar particles hurling into space at high rates of speed, sometimes affect electronic systems in satellites and on the ground. In this reports, we will see how TEC vary during two severe geomagnetic storms (G4 level) in August and March 2012 and the appearance of scintillation in those storms.

August 2011 On August 5, 2011, the combined cloud of three  consecutive CMEs produced brilliant auroras and caused a severe geomagnetic storm (G4 level). It was one of the strongest geomagnetic storms in years. The CMEs were hurled by three M-class flares erupted in active sunspot 1261, which are M1.4 on August 2, M6.0 on August 3 and M9.3 on August 4 [12, 13].

In this process, Kp index surpassed 7 and peaked at Kp-8 event. A major geomagnetic storm follows the impact of a CME on August 5 around 18 UT (Sudden Commencement). The initial phase peak at 20UT and got a peak of the minimum value at 4UT (-113nT) then recovery. TEC received in HCM (LT=UT+7) was seen a little decrease during the main phase in the morning and increase during the first of recovery phase (4UT to 11UT) then back to the normal. The increased number on daytime is about 20% (6 to 8 tecu).

In this storm, we saw a slight high of Scintillation at night on August 5 with S4 value higher than 0.3.

This  is in the sudden commencement time and initial phase.

Fig. 8: Geomagnetic Storm on August 5, 2011  March 2012 March 2012 is one the most active months of  Solar Cycle 24. On March 5, the active sunspot region 1429 erupted an X1.1-class flare at 04:13 GMT, unleashed a CME as well. According to NOAA, the wave of high-energy electromagnetic rays reached Earth in minutes, caused a strong radio blackout over China, India and Australia. The CME  arrived at the Earth on March 7 and caused a moderate geomagnetic storm. One day after, this 1429 region erupted a powerful X5.4-class flare at 00:24 UT on March 7. A related CME affected the Earth on March 8, causing a strong (G3) geomagnetic storm. Several M class flares were generated days after also reached our planet and caused two moderate storms on March 12 and 15 [14, 15].

Fig. 9: Geomagnetic Storm on March 7, 2012       A Sudden Commencement found at 10 UT on March 8 and, Dst got a positive maximum at 12 UT and negative minimum at 9 UT (-140nT). Kp index on March 9 reached the value of Kp-8 event at the main phase. Recovery phase lasted till the end of March 10.

GPS Data observed at HCM shows that the moderate storm on March 7 is not effect to TEC value. However, during the Dst minimum in the strong geomagnetic storm on March 8, the value of TEC have a big change. TEC increased from 10 to 35 tecu during daytime (about 20%) on March 9 and the next day. Scintillation appear from 12 to 16 UT of March 8. The peaks of S4 was more than 0.4 in the initial phase of storm.



IV. CONCLUSION  Over four years in the recent solar cycle 24, GPS data observed in HCM presented that both TEC and S4 vary depending solar activity. The TEC seasonal variation is found with maximum in the equinoxes and the minimum in the summer and winter. This  feature also presented on S4 index, however peaks of S4 concentrated clearly in March, April and September, October every year; especial in high Solar activity.

Almost S4 index retrieved in HCM is under 0.8.

This number is low and suitable with other station in equatorial region. The occurrence of scintillation is also found during the nighttime after 20LT.

In the comparison between GPS TEC and IRI- 2012, we saw that the prediction does not keep to GPS data in the high solar activity.

Geomagnetic storms effect to the TEC observed in HCM in two G4 storm was identified positive storms with the enhancement of TEC was about 20%. The scintillation found in the Sudden Commencements and initial phases of those storms with the values of S4 index was more than 0.3.
