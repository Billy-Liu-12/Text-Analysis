Electronic Prognostics System Implementation on Power Actuator Components

Abstract Prognostics-enablement of power actuator components involves acquisition and processing of multiple data and sensor inputs. Data collection and fusion creates an accurate prognostic prediction. To that end, Ridgetop has developed an extensible Prognostic Analysis System Platform and a companion Prognostics Telemetry Harness.

With an Electro-Mechanical Actuator (EMA) as the focus, this paper describes the extensible architecture for a Prognostics Health Management (PHM) system providing State of Health (SoH) and Remaining Useful Life' (RUL) metrics. The key enabler is the Ridgetop Prognostics Telemetry Harness (RPTH), which collects and preprocesses signals relating to the health of dynamically executing components and subsystems.
