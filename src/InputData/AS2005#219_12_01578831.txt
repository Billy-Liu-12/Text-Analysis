Abstract Association rules are often utilized in web recommen- dation systems for creation of suggested items lists. How- ever, lists obtained in this way may be too short. Indirect association rules are introduced to extend classical, direct association rules and supplement the knowledge they contribute. The relation between ranking lists created on the basis of association rules and hyperlinks existing on web pages has also been examined in the paper.

1. Introduction Recommendation systems are an important part of re- cent web based applications, especially for e-commerce services [13]. Some data mining methods are usually introduced to them to correlate presented items with items likely to be suggested, such as pages, products, advertise- ments, learning objects, etc., as well as to personalize web systems more effectively. Sequential patterns, association rules, and clustering methods are most commonly used for this purpose.

So far typical association rules have widely been ex- ploited as a source for recommendation ranking lists.

However, they come with some limitations: lists are often too short to provide enough suggestions for recommenda- tions for each web page. The purpose of this document is to introduce a way to extend them and supplement the knowledge they contribute with a new kind of association rules ? indirect ones. Yet another problem that has been considered is the correlation between ranking lists created on the basis of association rules and hyperlinks on a site.

2. Related Work Association rules have been utilized in many web rec- ommendation systems, applied in various domains such as suggestions in personalized distance learning [21], or next steps in web navigation, i.e. hyperlink recommendation [5, 17, 22], personalized shopping adviser [3, 4, 6], extension of web searching [2]. In the web environment association patterns can be extracted from server logs [5, 17, 21, 22], purchased products [3, 4, 6], or products placed into the basket [3], as well as web content [2]. Association rules outgoing from a certain page (fixed body of the rule) are usually ordered according to their quality measure, confi- dence, what enables the creation of a ranking list for this page. Chun et al. personalized such rankings using rule- user relevancy matrix derived from data about products purchased by the individual user [4].

Special kind of association between items, which in- clude transitive itemset ? mediator, has been called indi- rect association rule and proposed originally by Tan, Kumar, and Srivastava [18, 19]. However, their indirect rules differ from those described in this paper. Tan et al.

assumed that two items, e.g. web pages, must not be asso- ciated directly if they are expected to be related indirectly.

Thus, original indirect rules reflect rather negative asso- ciations existing between items. In our approach indirect rules are treated as an extension of direct ones, rather than as that kind of negative associations.

Tan et al. proposed that one pair of items may possess many indirect rules with many mediator sets which may overlap. In web recommendation systems we need one  measure that helps us find out whether the considered page should or should not be suggested to a user on the given page. There is no simple method of joining many rules to obtain such a single measure.

Additionally, we extract indirect rules from direct ones instead of from source data what is much more effective.

instead of from source data what is much more effective.

Hamano and Sato proposed their own method to mine both negative and positive indirect association rules simi- lar to Tan?s et al. using special ? measure [7]. Another algorithm HI-Mine was suggested by Wan and An [20].

3. Direct Association Rules in the Web Definition 1. Let di be an independent web page (docu- ment) and D be the web site content (the web page domain) that consists of independent web pages di?D.

Definition 2. A set X of pages di?D is called pageset X.

The number of pages in a pageset is called the length of the pageset. A pageset with the length k is denoted by k- pageset.

Definition 3. The i-th user session Si is the pageset con- taining all pages viewed by the user during one visit on the web site; Si?D. SS is the set of all user sessions gathered by the system, Si?SS. Each session must consist of at least two Applications (ISDA?05) 0-7695-2286-06/05 $20.00 ? 2005 IEEE pages: card(Si)?2. A session Si contains the pageset X if and only if X?Si.

Note that pagesets and user sessions are unordered and without repetitions ? we turn navigational sequences (paths) into sets. Additionally, user sessions may also be filtered to omit too short and too long ones, which are not representa- tive enough [11, 12].

Definition 4. A direct association rule is the implication X?Y, where X?D, Y?D and X?Y=?. A direct association rule is described by two measures: support and confidence.

The direct association rule X?Y has the support sup(X?Y)=sup(X?Y)/card(SS), where sup(X?Y) is the number of sessions Si containing both X and Y: X?Y?Si.

The confidence con for direct association rule X?Y is the probability that the session Si containing X also contains Y: con(X?Y)=sup(X?Y)/sup(X), sup(X) ? the number of ses- sions that contain the pageset X. The pageset X is the body and Y is the head of the rule.

Direct association rules represent regularities discovered from a large data set [1]. The problem of mining association rules is to extract rules that are strong enough and have the support and confidence value greater than given thresholds: minimal direct support supmin and minimal direct confi- dence conmin. In this paper, we consider dependencies only between 1-pagesets ? single web pages, so the 1- pageset X including di (X={di}) will be denoted by di and a direct association rule from di to dj is di?dj.

4. Indirect Association Rules Definition 5. Partial indirect association rule di?P#dj,dk is the indirect implication from di to dj with respect to dk, for which two direct association rules exist: di?dk and dk?dj with sup(di?dk)?supmin, con(di?dk)?conmin and sup(dk?dj)?supmin, con(dk?dj)?conmin, where di,dj,dk?D; di?dj?dk. The page dk, in the partial indirect association rule di?P#dj,dk, is called the transitive page.

There may be many transitive pages dk for a given pair of pages di,dj and as a result many partial indirect associa- tion rules di?P#dj,dk.

Each indirect association rule is described by partial indi- rect confidence conP#(di?P#dj,dk), as follows:  conP#(di?P#dj,dk) = con(di?dk) ? con(dk?dj)        (1) Pages di,dj in di?P#dj,dk do not need to have any com- mon sessions, but in (1) we respect only ?good? direct associations to ensure that indirect associations are based on sensible grounds. From questionable or uncertain direct knowledge we should not derive reasonable indirect knowl- edge. In consequence, it was assumed, rules di?dk and dk?dj must be ?strong? enough so that con(di?dk) and con(dk?dj) exceed conmin.

Partial indirect confidence is calculated using direct con- fidence without access to source user sessions. If the    fidence without access to source user sessions. If the IDARM algorithm is used, the computational complexity of partial indirect rule mining is only O(m), with respect to only access to the source data (sessions); where m is the number of processed direct rules [8].

Definition 6. The set of all possible transitive pages dk for which partial indirect association rules from di to dj exist, is called Tij (Fig. 1).

Transitive pages Tij dj Complete indirect association rule Partial indirect rules di Figure 1. A complete indirect association rule cre- ated from three component partial indirect rules Note that Tij is not the same set as Tji.

Definition 7. Complete indirect association rule di?#dj aggregates all partial indirect association rules from di to dj with respect to all existing transitive pages dk?Tij and it is characterized by complete indirect confidence - con#(di?#dj): con#(di?#dj)= ? ?? ? T Tcard k kj P i P max dddcon ij?  o1 ## , ,       (2) where maxT = ? ?? ?ij Ddd Tcard ji ?, max  ? the maximal number of component partial rules for a pair of pages.

Only indirect rules with complete indirect confidence greater than the given confidence threshold - iconmin are accepted. A complete indirect association rule from di to dj exists if and only if there exists at least one partial indirect association rule from di to dj. Complete indirect association rules are not symmetric: the rule di?#dj may exists but the reverse one dj?#di not necessarily.

5. Complex Rules, Recommendation Lists To enable the usage of both direct and indirect associa- tion rules for recommendation, the joined complex asso- ciation rules are introduced [9, 10]. They combine the main parameters of direct and indirect rules ? confidences.

Definition 8. Complex association rule di?*dj from di to dj exists, if and only if direct di?dj or complete indirect di?#dj association rule from di to dj exists. A complex association rule is characterized by complex confidence -  con*(di?*dj), as follows: con*(di?*dj) = D ?con(diodj) + (1-D) ?con#(dio#dj)    (3) where D ? direct confidence reinforcing factor, D?[0,1]. If either direct or indirect rule does not exist then con(diodj)=0 or con#(diodj)=0, respectively. When set- ting D we can emphasize or damp the direct confidence at the expense of the indirect one. Taking into account nor- Applications (ISDA?05) 0-7695-2286-06/05 $20.00 ? 2005 IEEE malization (2), factor D should be closer to 0 rather than to 1.

Distinct direct, indirect and complex recommendation ranking lists are generated for each page di based on the greatest values of confidences for direct con(di?dj), indi- rect con#(di?#dj), and complex rules con*(di?*dj), respec-    rect con#(di?#dj), and complex rules con*(di?*dj), respec- tively.

6. Ranking Comparison Once ranking lists have been created, a method to com- pare them is needed. For this purpose the Kendall?s coef- ficient of concordance was used to determine the similar- ity between two ranking lists.

Let X and Y be any n-item rankings, then the Kendall?s coefficient of concordance ?(X,Y) can be evaluated from the following formula [15]: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ???  ??? n i n j ijij yyxx nn YX?

1 1 sgnsgn , ,   (4) where: xi and yi are the positions of the same i-th item in ranking X and Y, respectively; they range from 1 to n; sgn(xj-xi) is the sign of the difference xj-xi. It means that if item j follows item i in ranking X, then sgn(xj-xi)=-1; if they are at the same position sgn(xj-xi)=0; otherwise sgn(xj-xi)=+1. When two rankings have the same items at every position, the Kendall?s coefficient for them is equal to +1. However, when two rankings have all the same items but they occur in reverse order, their Kendall?s coef- ficient equals -1.

As (4) can not be used for 1-item rankings, it was as- sumed that when the only item in both rankings was the same, the Kendall?s coefficient was assigned the value of 1, otherwise the value of -1 was assigned. The formula (4) works fine for rankings with the same number of items.

However, as far as recommendation ranking lists derived from association rules are concerned, it is rarely the case.

The length of ranking lists ranges from 1 to several hun- dred sometimes. Therefore a method for handling differ- ent length rankings had to be devised. We suggest append- ing all items from ranking Y, which do not occur in list X, after the last item in ranking X. All appended items obtain the same position: the origin length of X plus 1.

7. Experiments A series of experiments has been conducted in order to discover the influence of direct and indirect association rules on recommendation ranking lists.

7.1. Test Environment The data used for the experiments came from web log files of two big Polish sites, one significant e-commerce that offers hardware, and the other the main portal of Wroclaw University of Technology (WUT).

First the log data were cleansed. All multimedia re- quests and those generated by search engine spiders, which constituted over 90% of all entries, were removed.

Then sessions were identified on the basis of the same user hostname, the same agent and the time interval be- tween two consecutive requests within 25.5 minutes [16].

After removing one-page sessions and too long ones (more than 80 pages), which do not reflect actual user behavior, 173,896 sessions were left for WUT log data, for the period of 9 weeks. For e-commerce this number was 16,085 sessions for the 4-month period. Statistical data for the two sites are presented in Table 1.

Table 1. Statistical data for two test environments Item E-commerce WUT Total pages 2,799 10,661 Total cleansed sessions 16,085 173,896    Total cleansed sessions 16,085 173,896 Average session length 7.3 4.7 Total direct rules 547,338 409,318 conmin 1% 1% supmin 0.02% 0.001% Filtered direct rules 64,716 124,236 Average con for filtered direct rules 19.99% 34.38% Partial indirect rules 8,292,224 7,563,070 Total complete indirect rules 1,160,786 1,169,477 iconmin 0.01% 0.01% Filtered complete indirect rules 327,859 631,908 Average con for filtered indir. rules 0.09% 0.34% ? 2% 5% Complex rules 330,948 637,744 Average con for complex rules 0.17% 0.65% Pages with any rules 1,865 4,733 To ensure that indirect rules were formed only from strong direct ones, conmin and supmin thresholds were introduced [14]. conmin was the same for both the sites, whereas supmin had to be smaller for the WUT site due to the fact that the number of pages on this site was consid- erably bigger and at the same time the average session length was smaller then on the e-commerce site. Similarly, iconmin was introduced for complete indirect rules. Its value was set to the square of conmin for both of the sites.

The parameter ? used to reinforce or dump direct rules at the expense of indirect ones was set to a very small value for both the sites: 2% for e-commerce and 5% for WUT, since the mean confidence for filtered direct rules was significantly greater than the mean confidence for filtered indirect rules for both the sites; 213 and 102 times greater for e-commerce and WUT, respectively.

7.2. Ranking Lists Comparison Having direct, indirect and complex association rules, we compared recommendation ranking lists by means of Applications (ISDA?05) 0-7695-2286-06/05 $20.00 ? 2005 IEEE the Kendall?s coefficient for e-commerce and the WUT site. In particular, similarities between direct and complex ranking lists were examined. We cut the lists at various lengths: 1, 2, 3, 4 as well as 5, and tested the Kendall?s coefficient for such rankings.

The results of the experiment show that the median for 1-item rankings was 1 for both the sites (and for 2-item  rankings for e-commerce), which means that most of the pages recommended at the first position were the same for direct and complex rankings, more for e-commerce, as the average is greater and the standard deviation is smaller.

Nevertheless, 12.8% of rankings for e-commerce and 46.6% for WUT had the first item that was different. The results for 1-item rankings do not follow a pattern set by a bit longer lists. For lists with up to 5 items the mean and the average appear to increase gradually and the standard deviation appears to fall as the length of the list rises (Fig.

2 and 3). On average, the Kendall?s coefficient for all ranking lengths examined was higher for e-commerce.

This may have resulted from the value of the ? parameter reinforcing more direct rules and thus making direct and complex recommendation ranking lists more similar.

The greatest changes between direct and complex rank- ing lists can be observed in the first and second position. It is also in these very first positions that we gain most from introducing indirect and complex rules, as they offer com- pletely new knowledge. Moreover, even for very short rankings the percentage of pages for which new items were added for direct rankings was quite high, which indicates that they were certainly enriched with new sug- gestions (Fig. 4).

Extension of Direct Ranking Lists with Complex Rules The main reason for using indirect association rules is the fact that they provide substantially more suggestions for recommendations compared with direct rules In our experiments there was a great number of pages with very few recommendations (5 items or less) ? 25.5% of all pages with any ranking for e-commerce and 27.7% for WUT. This is the case when indirect association rules may become very useful, since they can considerably lengthen short direct ranking lists. On average, indirect rankings were 13 times longer than direct ones for e-commerce and 11 times longer for WUT.

Contribution of pages with too short rank- ings lists based on direct rules within pages with any ranking Applications (ISDA?05) 0-7695-2286-06/05 $20.00 ? 2005 IEEE In general, the average percentage of pages with too short rankings was quite prominent. Our solution to this problem is the extension of direct ranking lists with indi- rect and complex ones. We tested the contribution of pages with too short rankings which were successfully extended with complex rules within all pages with short rankings. In order to do this, we took the number of pages with too short direct rankings for which complex ranking list was longer than direct one, for a required list length, and next we divided it by the total number of pages with too short direct rankings. The obtained results were very similar for indirect and complex rules. They show how much short direct ranking lists can be extended with indi- rect or complex ones (Fig. 6). For complex rankings the percentage started from 97.5% for e-commerce and 70.1% for WUT (for 2-item rankings) and reached 99.89% for e- commerce and 95.1% for WUT.

This definitely emphasizes the usefulness of complex and in consequence indirect association rules.

A vital question one can ask is whether recommenda- tion ranking lists only confirm existing hyperlinks or maybe they add new knowledge as well. If all they did was confirm the existing structure of hyperlinks on a site, the recommendations offered to a user might not be inter- esting to them.

In order to test if ranking lists add anything new, the content of the WUT site was downloaded. From it infor- mation about all hyperlinks on each page was extracted.

Having the structure of the site we were able to assess recommendation lists in the following way: the number of common items in hyperlink sets and ranking lists cut at various lengths was divided by the ranking length i.e. the required length or the actual length if it was smaller than the required length. Such calculations were performed for direct, indirect and complex recommendation lists, Fig. 7.

The results for direct, indirect and complex rankings for very short lists (1 and 2 items) differ substantially: 27.1%, 4.6% and 11.7% respectively for 1 item. The same is true for 20-item long lists: 19.9%, 19% and 11.7% re-  spectively. This indicates that for very short indirect and complex rankings (up to 2 pages) and long ones (20 items and more) recommendation lists go beyond confirming existing hyperlinks and add new potentially useful knowl- edge.

Assessment of Hyperlinks by Association Rules Another application of direct, indirect and complex rules may be the assessment of hyperlinks on a site. We can test whether the hyperlinks on a page have been    can test whether the hyperlinks on a page have been placed appropriately by analyzing significant navigational patterns (association rules) derived from user behavior.

In our experiments the percentage of hyperlinks con- firmed by rules was calculated by dividing the number of common items in hyperlink sets and whole ranking lists for a given page, by the number of hyperlinks on the page, separately for direct, indirect and complex rules (Fig. 8).

Note that the number of hyperlinks was put in the de- nominator as opposed to calculations in section 7.4 where it was ranking length.

The average percentage of all hyperlinks confirmed by rules Applications (ISDA?05)  0-7695-2286-06/05 $20.00 ? 2005 IEEE The average percentage of hyperlinks confirmed by di- rect rules amounted to only 48%, probably because there were too few of them. Indirect and complex rules, on the other hand, confirmed many more hyperlinks ? 87% and 89%, respectively, due to their larger quantity. These relatively great values that we received may have resulted from the enormous differences between the average num- ber of hyperlinks on a page ? 10 and the average ranking length: 51, 177, 180 for direct, indirect and complex rules, respectively. Concluding, indirect and complex rules ap- pear to be better at assessing the usefulness of hyperlinks compared to direct rules.

Note that in any case at least 11% of hyperlinks were not confirmed by any rule, so they may be recommended to be removed from the content of pages.

8. Conclusions and future work Complex rules combining both direct and indirect rules usually increase the length of rankings compared to those based on direct associations. This helps overcome the problem of a multitude of pages with too short rankings (Fig. 5) and makes it possible for them to fulfill the re- quested ranking length (Fig. 6). Additionally, indirect rules substantially change the order of ranking lists (Fig. 2 and 3). Recommendation lists based on direct rules to a greater extent only confirm hyperlinks existing on web pages compared to lists extracted from complex rules, for short and long ranking lengths (Fig. 7). Besides, all kinds of rules, especially indirect and complex ones, can be useful for the assessment of hyperlinks.

Concluding, far more diverse indirect rules can signifi- cantly improve potential value of recommendation. Never- theless, to confirm the usefulness of indirect rules for end users, some tedious tests with their participation are re- quired.
