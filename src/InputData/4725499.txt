Mining Positive and Negative Weighted Association Rules from Frequent  Itemsets Based on Interest

Abstract   The weighted association rules (WARs) mining are  made because importance of the items is different.

Negative association rules (NARs) play important roles in decision-making. But the misleading rules occur and some rules are uninteresting when discovering positive and negative weighted association rules (PNWARs) simultaneously. So another parameter is added to eliminate the uninteresting rules. A new model in the paper of extending the support-confidence framework with a sliding interest measure could avoid generating misleading rules. An interest measure was defined and added to the mining algorithm for association rules in the model. The interest measure was set according to the demand of users. The experiment demonstrates that the algorithm discovers interesting weighted negative association rules from large database and deletes the contrary rules.

1. Introduction   Association Rule is an important type of knowledge representation revealing implicit relationships among the items present in large number of transactions.

Association rule mining (ARM) is firstly proposed by R.Agrawal, T.Imielinski and A.Swam in 1993[1]. The fast algorithm called Algorithm Apriori is put forward in 1994[2]. Much effort has been devoted and algorithms proposed for discovering association rules efficiently [3][4]. These conventional association rules are widely used in many application domains, such as market basket analysis and web trace.

Sometimes the decision-makers are concerned with the patterns that are low frequent but correlated strongly to reduce the negative influence that the  disadvantageous factors bring on. Therefore negative association rules play an important role in many areas, especially in competitive analysis and investment analysis. But little study is about negative association rules, especially weighted negative association rules. S.

Brin et al. first mentions the negative relationships between two frequent items in 1997 [5]. Recently, the problem of identifying negative associations (or ?dissociations?), addressing also the absence of itemsets, has been explored and considered relevant [6][7]. In [8] A.Savasere et al. propose strong negative association rules. In [9] X.J. Dong et al. propose correlation method to solve these questions. But the user can?t control the number of the rules flexible. In this paper, a method based on the interest measure is defined. The number of rules is restricted making use of the value of the interest measure.

All the items in a database are treated in a uniform in the traditional Algorithm Apriori in above decision.

However, it is not true in the real world databases, in which different items usually have different importance. The model of weighted association rule and corresponding algorithm are proposed by C. H. Cai et al.[10]. To solve the different importance of the items, Wei Wang et al. propose an efficient mining method for Weighted Association Rules (WAR) [11].

In this paper, the negative association rule mining based on the interest measure is extended to the weighted. The mined items are just about what the user pays more attention to. On the contrary, the misleading rules are eliminated by interest measure simultaneously. An algorithm for mining the positive and negative weighted association rules (PNIWAR) is proposed by the way that the interest measure method is combined with the method for mining the weighted association rules.

Problem formulation and related work  2.1. Weighted Association Rules   Weighted Association Rules is as follows: there are  n records and m items. Let I ={i1,i2,....,im}be a set of items and W={w1, w2,?, wm}(wi? [0,1]?be a set of non-negative real numbers. A pair(X, w(X)) is called a weighted item where X?I is an item and w(X)?W is the weight associated with X. A transaction is a set of weighted items, each of which may appear in multiple transactions with different weights. A dataset may therefore be defined as a set D of transactions.

Given a weighted itemset X and a set of transactions, referred to as D, we say X has support in D if s% of transactions in D support X. The weighted support of an itemset X in a dataset D, denoted as wsup(X)= countD(X)/|D|*w(X), where countD(X) is the number of transactions in D containing X. Note that the support of a weighted itemset X is always less than or equal to the support of any of its generalization.

There are several different formulations for the weighted support of the rule X?Y according to the different demand, where X?I, Y?I, and X?Y=?. In this paper the following form is used: sup(X?Y)= countD(X?Y)/|D| wsup(X?Y) = avg{ w1, w2,?, wp } * sup(X?Y) where p is the items? count of the itemset X, avg{ w1, w2,?, wp } is the average value of the weight of itemset X?Y and sup(X?Y) is support of itemset X?Y before the item is associated with weight.

An itemset is said to be weighted-frequent (large) if its support is larger than a user-specified value (also called minimum weighted support (wminsup)).

The confidence of the WAR denoted as conf is the ratio of the weighted support of X?Y over the weighted support of X. The weighted support of X?Y (wsup) in the transactions is larger than wminsup, furthermore when X appears in a transaction, Y is likely to appear in the same transaction with a probability conf. X?Y is a valid rule if its weighted support wsup(X?Y) and weighted confidence wconf(A?B) meet minimum weighted support (wminsup) and minimum weighted confidence (wminconf).

2.2. Calculate Support and Confidence of Weighted Negative Association Rules   There are very few papers to discuss and discover  negative association rules. Brin et.al[5]mentioned for the first time in the literature the notion of negative relationships. In [12], each positive rule X?Y correspond three negative ones, X??Y, ?X?Y and  ?X??Y. A transaction t supports X??Y if X ?t and Y?t.

Mining negative association rules, however, raises a number of critical issues. The number of infrequent itemsets increases by exponential, so the search space of the negative association rules is large than the positive. Therefore, the support and confidence of the negative association rules is difficult and disinteresting directly. For instance, if the number of the frequent itemsets is 250, the number of the infrequent ones is (21000-250) approximately 21000. So support and confidence of the negative ARs can be straightforwardly deduced from the corresponding positive itemset supports. In fact, the support and confidence of negative association rule associated with weight are transformed to the following forms to be calculated [9]:  Calculate weighted support of WARs (1)wsup(?A) = 1-wsup(A); (2)wsup(A ? ?B) = wsup(A)-wsup(A ? B); (3)wsup(?A ? B) = wsup(B)- wsup(A ? B); (4)wsup(?A ? ?B)=1-wsup(A)-wsup(B) + wsup(A ? B); Calculate weighted confidence of WARS: (5)wconf(A??B) = ( ) ( )  ( ) w s u p A - w s u p A B  w s u p A ?  =1- wconf (A?B); (6)wconf(?A?B) = ( ) -  ( )  1 - ( ) w s u p B w s u p A B  w s u p A ? ;  (7) wconf (?A??B) = ( ) ( ) ( ) )  ( ) 1 - w s u p A - w s u p B  +  w s u p A B  1 - w s u p A ?  =1- wconf (?A?B) ?.

3. An algorithm for mining positive and negative association rules by interest   The negative association rules are as important as the positive, so both of them are mined simultaneously.

But some problems such as self-contradictory rules may occur when studying both the positive and negative association rules.

Example 1 Suppose we are interested in analyzing the transactions of apples (denoted by A) and bananas (denoted by B) in a supermarket. In 1000 transactions, 500 transactions contain apples, 500 transactions contain bananas and 50 transactions contain both apples and bananas. Given w(A) = 0.9, w(B)=0.9  Then wsup(A)= 0.45    wsup(B)=0.45    wsup(A?B)=0.045 conf (A?B) = 0.1  conf(A??B) = 0.9 conf (?A?B)=0.74            conf(?A??B)=0.36  Suppose wminsup=0.1 and wminconf=0.1, the four rules are valid association rules. Obviously, the rule     A?B and the rule A??B are inconsistent. But which one is right or all are right?

3.1. Problem analysis   The contrary is produced be the adequate condition  in the process of generating the rules. The most common framework in the association rules generation is the ?support-confidence? one. But the framework satisfies the case, so another parameter is added. In order to eliminate these misleading rules, many kinds of measure are proposed, such as interestingness, correlation coefficient, Laplace, Gini-index, Piatetsky- Shapiro.  In [12], the definition of the correlation is proposed. In [9] the authors bring forward the formulary of calculating measure correlation and propose an algorithm based on the correlation.

Although the measure correlation can eliminate the misleading rules, the author can?t control the number of the rules. In this paper, the interest of an association rule can be defined in terms of the measure associated with it, as well as in the form an association can be found.

3.2. Definition of interest measure   Piatetsky-Shapiro argued that the rule X?Y is not  interesting if sup (X?Y)?sup(X)sup(Y)[13]. This argument proposes that only if sup(X?Y)- sup(X)sup(Y)?mi, the rule is of interest, where the mi is specified by the user. But this argument is applied to the positive association rule, rather than motion to the negative and weighted association rules.

In this paper, we extend the argument to weighted negative association rules. The interest measure is calculated as follows:  interest=|wsup (X?Y)-wsup(X)wsup(Y)|.

If interest>mi, the rule is interesting; otherwise it is not of interest. Next , (1)if wsup(X?Y)- wsup(X)wsup(Y)>0, then the rule X?Y is positive correlated, (2)if wsup (X?Y)-wsup(X)wsup(Y)<0, then the rule X?Y is negative correlated, (3)if wsup (X?Y)- wsup(X)wsup(Y)=0, then the item X and the item Y is independent, so the rule is not mined.

3.3. Algorithm based on the interest   In this section, we add on top of the support-  confidence framework another measure called interest and an efficient algorithm PNIWAR. The rules are mined from the frequent items. Suppose the frequent items are put in the itemset L. The frequent itemset L is generated by the method of level-wise search.

The main procedure of Algorithm PNIWAR:  Input L: frequent itemsets, wminsup: minimum weighted support, wminconf: minimum weighted confidence, mi: minimum interest threshold Output PAR: set of positive associate rule; NAR: set of negative associate rule; (1) PAR =??NAR =?? (2) //mining PNIWARs in L.

for any item set X in L do  {  for any item set A?B = X and A?B =? do { interest=|wsup (X?Y)-wsup(X)wsup(Y)|; if interest>mi then {  //the rule is interesting if wsup (X?Y)-wsup(X)wsup(Y)>0 then {(2.1)//generate rules of the forms A?B and ?A??B.

if c(A?B) ? minconf  then PAR = PAR ?{A?B};  if c(?A??B) ? minconf  then NAR = NAR ?{?A??B}; }  if wsup (X?Y)-wsup(X)wsup(Y)<0 then {(2.2)//generate rules of the forms A??B and ?A?B.

if c(A??B) ? minconf  then NAR = NAR ?{A??B};  if c(?A?B) ? minconf  then NAR = NAR ?{?A?B}; }  } } } (3) return PAR and NAR;  In this algorithm, it can produce the positive and negative rules in four forms that meet the support and confidence thresholds and eliminate the self-contrary rules. The users can control the number of the rule according to their interestingness.

4. Experiment results   We conducted our experiments on a man-made dataset to study the behavior of the algorithms compared. The dataset had 200 transactions, when only the six largest categories were kept. We compare with traditional Algorithm Apriori (Apriori) and an algorithm based on interest (PNIWAR). Suppose wminsup=8%, wminconf=10%, each algorithm was run to generate a set of association rules. The result was reported as Table1.

We could draw two conclusions as follows: (1) The interest measure could eliminate the misleading rules.

From Table 1, the number of positive rules generated by the PNIWAR was less than that of Apriori. That showed that the self-contrary rules and     uninteresting rules are deleted. At the same time, a number of negative rules were discovered.

Table1. The number of rules generated by  different algorithms Apriori PNIWAR mi=0 mi=0.01 mi=0.02 mi=0.03 Positive  rules 520 487 381 205 93  Negative rules  540 394 206 94   (2) The number of association rules was different when the minimum interest mi was diverse.

That demonstrated that the user might pay attention to those that they were interesting to. Thus, they made their decision according the rules more quickly.

Specially, the result of the algorithm based on the interest measure was converted to the general method of discovering the association rules when the mi=0.

That means the uninteresting rules were filtrated according to the value of mi.

It is clear from Table 1 that PNIWAR is efficient because the number of positive rules decreases.

5. Conclusions and future research directions   The question of contrary rules is important when NARs are studied. The interest is one of measures.

Moreover the interest measure eliminates the uninteresting rules by setting the value of interest. The experiment results performed in the man-made database prove that our algorithm is efficient.
