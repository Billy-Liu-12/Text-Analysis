Abstract - Geophone is a specific sensor in geophysical exploration. The geophone tester is mainly used to test the performance parameters of geophone such as DC resistance, natural frequency, damping coefficient, sensitivity, distortion and so on. Some domestic testers are big, low precision and high power consumption and not suitable for outdoors. The testers abroad are expensive and their performances are not stable. This paper designs a high performance-cost ratio tester based on FPGA. It adopts EDA technology and programmable Cyclone II series FPGA on the platforms of DSP_Builder and Quartus II.

I. INTRODUCTION  Seismic Prospecting is the most popular way in geophysical exploration to acquire resource information such as oil,natural gas and etc. Its special sensor or tool is geophone [1].  The geophones must be tested by special tester one by one before using. In view of the needs of exploration environment, the tester must have characterstics of high precision, small volume, low power and high reliability.

At present, domestic geophone testers are invided two kinds. One sort of testers are based on PC104,which have higer precision and small size,but their power consumptions are  high, so they are not adopt to use in the field. The other are based on the technology of DDS and ARM, which have low power and small size, but they cost much and their precision are not high. Although the testers overseas have high precision, but they have small memory and too high price. In the high temperature environment, some of them are easily to be halted and damaged, which may lead to waste [2].

This paper designs a portable  tester with high precision based on FPGA and isp technology refering on the products at home and abroad.



II. SYSTEM  STRUCTURE  Fig. 1 is the principle block diagram of new tester based on FPGA.

Its working process are as follows. The DDS Direct Digital Synthesis block generates standard testing signals according to testing function, and the signals are input to the tester or standard referenced resistance. Controlled by FPGA, the ADC samples the output signal and the data acquired are processed by FIR filter and FFT techniques. The results are send to host computer by communicating between RS232  UART controller and MCU. The further data processing and display are completed by host computer.

III.  TESTING  PRINCIPLE  A . The Structure and Model of Geophone The principle of moving coil geophone is that vibration  can impel coils cut the magnetic line of force and consequently produce electromotive force in coils. Fig. 2 is its structure and kinetic model.It is a classical second-order sensor [3,4]. In Fig.2, F indicates electrical force acting on coils, K indicates  stiffness coefficient of spring, m indicates the quality of suspension system, c indicates  damping coefficient, x(t) indicates  the absolute displacement of mass block, y(t)  indicates  the absolute displacement of vibrate object on which  geophone is fixed.

B. Polarity and DC Resistance Testing The geophone bunch must be connected in the homopolar  way in order to get the best testing effect. Polarity testing is to obtain the positive and negative electrode of geophone. In the polarity testing, firstly, knock on the Geophone, then the tester samples the signal outputing form the Geophone continuously and analyse the data. As shown in Fig. 3, if the signal is higher     than a threshold and keeps high longer than a minimal period, we can judge the polarity of tester by different sounds.

(a) That of positive polarity.     (b) That of negative polarity.

Fig. 3  Response signals in polarity testing.

In direct current (DC) resistance testing, a invariable current is firstly loaded to a standard resistance R and we test its output voltage Vout1, then the same current is acted on the geophone controled by  relay and then we measure the output voltage Vout2 when it is stable. We can get DC resistance Rs from (1) [5].

R V VR  out  out s ?=   2                                                 (1)  C. Testing of Natural Frequency, Damping Coefficient, Sensitivity  The coils of Geophone will cut the magnetic line of force when they are moving, and then the electromotive force will be generated at both ends of coils. On the other hand, the coils plcaed in magnetic field will moving if there is current in them. So if a impulse current acts on the coils, the answer signal produced by geophone is related to natural frequency,damping coefficient, sensitivity and equivalent mass of the moving coils [6].

When testing, firstly, a pulse current of certain wide (about 40 percentage of natural frequency) is impulsed on geophone. Thus the coils will attenuate and oscillate at the law of sines in the magnetic field, we can get the response curve as shown in Fig. 4. In the figure, A1 indicates the amplitude of the first peak of the voltage, A2 indicates the amplitude of the second peak, T indicates the first zero-crossing point time.

By using A1, A2 and T acquired through testing, We can get natural frequency f0, damping coefficient Bt, sensitivity Gs by (2)~(5) [7-9].

D.  Distortion Testing Because the coils of geophone are not installed at the  central position of magnetic field, its parameters will have slight nolinear and its output will nolinear too, this is called response distortion. In distortion testing, a standard sine signal of certain frequency is acted on the geophone, and we sample output signal with 32 points per period. We process these data by using FFT and get amplitude value of each harmonic such as A1,A2,A3,A4, A5 and so on. Finally we can get distortion by calculating the percentage of fundamental wave and harmonic wave by using (6) [7].

IV.  HARDWARE DESIGN OF TESTER  A .  ADC Sampling Sequential Control The analog-digital converter (ADC) used in the tester is  24 bit high precision -  ADS1252 of TI corporation.

Accroding to the requirement  of conversion timing, we design the system by using mixed programming based on VHDL language and graphics mode at the environment of FPGA. Fig.

B.  Digital Filter Designing The siganl acquired by tester should be  processed by  low-pass digital filter in order to improve signal-to-noise ratio and anti-interference ability. Considering resource of FPGA and real-time of tester, we design a 16th order direct I type FIR low-pass digital filter as shown in Fig. 6.

In the design of  FIR filter, Kaiser window is used with the paramters such as 0.5 of  beta, 6.4KHz of sampling frequency, 200Hz of cutoff frequency. The filter is designed in the environment of DSP_Builder 6, and filter coefficients as     h(0)~h(15)  are extracted, quantified and exported by using FDATool at the environment of Matlab7 [10].

C.  The Realization of 32 Points FFT Fig. 7 is the block diagram of mixed radix parallel 32  points FFT algorithm. we call butterfly operation modules of DSP_Builer in the environment of simulink of MATLAB7 and programme accroding to Fig.7 [10]. This FFT algorithm is used in distortion testing.

D.  The Realization of Serial Communication The UART control module is designed by using VHDL  at the environment of QuartusII [10]. It is shown as Fig. 8.

Here we choose 115.2Kbps,8 bit data, no check mode.

In Fig.8, clk is the clock signal with  frequency of 24MHz; rst is reset signal of UART; tp_mode_sel is the key of working  mode choosing; p_cmd_rst is the reset key when event of sending or receiving has ended; rst is serial input signal; bclk indicates band rate; char_done indicates the ending of receiving or sending a char; txd is serial output port.

When the system starts to work, p_cmd_rs and p_xmit_cmd should be set to low, thus UART would be in receiving state.The received data will be stored in FIFO of 8 words  buffers.The sampling would begin if the command was vaild.

The processed data are put into the sending buffers of 256 words FIFO. Then p_xmit_cmd and p_cmd_rst are set to high, the data sending starts.

Improvement Actions on Performance The experiment results show that the designed tester has  characterstics such as high precision, low power, small size, easily operational maintenance, etc.  The following items can improve its precision and stability furthermore.

1) It is necessary to temperature compensation for the DC resistance and damping coefficient. We can get ambient temperature t from 1-wire interface temperature sensor DS18B20,whose sensitivity is ?0.5?C. According to the temperature characteristic of geophone, we can conclude as follows[5,9].

2) The clock in the system should be high stable.

Temperature-compensation crystal oscillator or constant- temperature crystal oscillator are low drift, high performance and can be used as the clock source of FPGA.

3) The voltage reference of ADC and DAC should use low drift and high precision integrated regulator. Analog ground and digital ground should be connected by single point near ADC and DAC.

4) In order to improve interference immunity, PCB (Printed Circuit Board) should have large area bonding copper.

5) Reduce the sampling rate of ADC appropriate to get higher conversion accuracy.

6) The geophone must be placed vertically during the testing, otherwise the data acquired would be ineffective [11].
