Modeling Community Influence in Social Networks with Markov Chains

Abstract?Social network analysis has been one of the research focuses with the developing of social media services.

Social influence also attracts ever-increasing attention and interests from both the sociology and the data mining scholars, but the research of influence is mainly limited in the user level, the community level influence is rarely involved. In this paper, we develop a novel model to analyze and evaluate the community level influence and help the decision maker to comprehend the disparity in influence of different communities. This paper also proposes a simple heuristic node-selection strategy considering the community influence to spread influence, and the experiments of the spread of influence through the social network datasets prove the rationality of the proposed community influence analysis model.

I.  INTRODUCTION The social media services have dramatically changed the  way people getting and transferring information and the pattern people communicating with each other. In recent years, the social influence has the great application in viral marketing through the social networking websites such as Sina Weibo, Facebook, Myspace, Flickr, LinkedIn and so on. The enterprises frequently use this kind of platforms to promote their products and services through the word-of-mouth advertising among the colleagues or friends; this increases the possibility that users adopt the products. Hence, this becomes the best motivation for scholars to further investigate the social influence, and a lot of achievements have been obtained [1- 8].

To evaluate the user level influence, a number of influence models were put forward using different measurement criteria.

As is known to us all, the centrality as an efficient tool for analyzing the social networks attracts a mass of attention [9].

The node?based centrality is a good indicator of measuring the importance of a node in social network, a node with a high centrality score is usually considered more highly influential than the other nodes in network [10]. The node centrality includes the degree centrality, closeness centrality [11] and betweenness centrality [12], the most popular and also the simplest measurement is the degree centrality, and it is often used for studying networks at first step, literature [1] put forward the degree-centrality-based influence evaluation model and literature [2] proposed the betweenness-centrality-based influence evaluation model. Cha et al. [3] presented an in-depth comparison of three different measures of influence including indegree, retweets, and mentions through large amount of  Twitter data, and also studied the dynamics of user influence across topics and time. Tang et al. [4] presented topical affinity propagation (TAP) to model the topic-level social influence on large networks, TAP can exert the results of any topic modeling and structure of network to perform influence propagation in topic-level.

Social influence analysis has lots of applications in the real world; influence maximization in viral marketing is an example of such an application with great importance. In recent works, Dominagos et al. [5] formulated the influence maximization problem as a ranking problem utilizing the Markov Random Field Model (MRFM), and then proposed an efficient algorithm to learn MRFM [6]. Chen et al. [7] proposed a new degree discount heuristics (Degree-Discount) to improve the influence spread, and the algorithm achieved much better influence spread than classic degree and centrality-based heuristics.

From the achievements of social influence research, it can be realized that the majority of the social influence research focuses on user level influence, and yet, the community level influence is rarely concerned. But plenty of achievements in community detection has been obtained [13-16], and this offers the possibility to investigate the community level influence.

Bel?k et al. [8] investigated online discussion fora, and then presented a framework for cross-community influence analysis, but Bel?k didn?t make an intensive study of the community level influence. In this paper, a novel community influence analysis model with Markov Chains is proposed, and the experiment of validating the rationality is conducted.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section II the preliminaries are introduced succinctly. Section III presents the community influence analysis model in detail, and then a simple node-selection strategy is put forward and the experiments of influence spreading is performed in section IV.

Finally, Section V draws a conclusion.



II. PRELIMINARIES In dynamic social network, a community?s influence will change overtime, and the community influence (CI) only depends upon the contribution from the other communities in current state, and CI is independent of the previous status. This is consistent with the property of Markov Chain. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a community influence analysis model based on Markov Chain Model. This section introduces the preliminaries succinctly below.

Basic Concepts Let ( )G  V,  E= denote the graph modeled from the social  network, where V is the set of vertices, and E is the set of edges in the network, the number of vertices n  | |V= . The vertices correspond to users and the links correspond to the social relationships as is the convention.

Given vertex v V? , let ( )N v denote the neighbors of vertex v.

B. Markov Chain The Markov chain [17-19] is a mathematical system that  undergoes transitions from one state to another which is named after Andrey Markov. A Markov chain is a stochastic process with the Markov property on a finite or countable state space, it refers to the sequence or chain of states such a process moves through.

A Markov chain is a sequence of random state variables 1 2 3, , ,...X X X with the Markov property, the future and past states are independent given the present state. This can be formalized as follows:  1 2 31 1 2 3   Pr( | , , ,..., )  Pr( | )  nn n  nn n  X x X x X x X x X x  X x X x +  +  = = = = =  = = = (1)  Here, we call each transition a step, the probability Markov chain evolving from one state to another state during one step is denoted by Prij , the probability depends only upon the current state.

1Pr Pr( | )ij n j n iX x X x+= = =   (2)

III. COMMUNITY INFLUENCE ANALYSIS BY USING MARKOV CHAINS  In this section, we use the Markov Chain to model the community influence; and the community influence analysis model is referred to as CIAM-MCM. At first, we introduce the general procedure of CIAM-MCM briefly, and then we will state the CIAM-MCM in detail.

A. The General Procedure The general procedure consists of five steps.

1) Obtaining the information that which community a vertex belongs to: The community structure information can be known a priori e.g. from an in-field research, or determined by a community detection algorithm [20], then the membership information can be acquired.

2) Analyzing the strength of mutual impact between vertices: The strength can be obtained through some heuristics.

3) Obtaining the community mutual impact.

4) Obtaining the influences of different communities.

5) Validating the community influence.

B. The Community Influence Analysis Model CIAM-MCM Definition 1 (membership matrix): In the  network ( )G  V,  E= , if the community structure is known as a partition 1 1 1G ( , ), ... ( , ),..., ( , ), {1, ..., }j j j k k kV E G V E G V E j k? , the users? affiliations are represented as a n k?  matrix M. The matrix element of M is defined as follows:  1 if i-th vertex V  . . {1, ..., }, {1, ..., }  j ijM otherwise s t i n j k  ?? = ? ?  ? ? (3)  ijM represents the user?s affiliation, if 1ijM = ,that means the i th?  vertex belongs to the j th?  community ( , )j j jG V E .

Definition 2 ( -ego? network): Given vertex v V? , we let vG G ? ? represent v?s -ego?  network, where -ego?  denote the  sub-network formed by v?s -degree? neighbors in graph G, and 1? ?  is a tunable parameter which can control the scale of the ego-network. Specially, the 1-ego network means the network composed of v?s neighbors.

We assume that the bigger the ratio of common vertices of uG ? and vG?  to the total vertices of tvG , the easier vertex v is  impacted by vertex u.

Definition 3 (user mutual impact matrix): Given vertex ,u v V? . Here we use the ratio of common vertices of  uG and 1vG to the total vertices of 1vG  to denote the impact  strength of vertex u to vertex v. Then the user mutual impact matrix can be represented as a n n?  matrix UMI. The matrix element of UMI is defined as follows:  ( ) ( ) ( )  | | , {1, ..., }, {1, ..., }  | |ij N i N j  UMI i n j n N j  ? = ? ?    (4)  ijUMI  represents the impact strength of the i th? vertex to the j th? vertex.

Definition 4 (user community impact matrix): According to the definition 1 and definition 2, we formalize the impact of different users to various communities as an n k? matrix UCI, it can be obtained as a product of matrix UMI and matrix M.

Matrix UCI is defined as follows:  UCI UMI M= ?         (5) Definition 5 (community mutual impact matrix): According  to the definition 1 and definition 3, the k k? community mutual impact matrix can also be acquired from the product of matrix M?s transpose and matrix UCI. The community mutual impact matrix is defined as follows:  TCMI M UCI= ?         (6)     The element ijCMI represents the total impact of users in the i th? community to users in the j th? community.

C. The Formulation of CIAM-MCM Here we adopt the Markov Chain Model to model the  community influence, and then calculate the community influence through CIAM-MCM.

We adapt the community mutual impact matrix CMI to the transition matrix of Markov Chain Model which is referred to as P . The matrix P is defined as follows:  ( 1)1 121  2 1  ( 1)2 212  1 1  1( 1) 2( 1) ( 1)  1 2  ( 1)1 2  1 2 1  0 ...

(7)  where , {1,..., }iCMI i n? is the total impact of the i th?  community to the other communities, i.e.

n  i ij j  CMI CMI =  =? .

By a convention, the initial distribution matrix of the community influence 0 (1,1,...,1)TCI = , the community influence after t steps is represented as tCI .

According to the property of Markov Chain[21-22], the tCI is defined by:  1 ( ) 0* ... *t t tCI P CI P CI?= = =   (8) In addition, the community influence (CI) can be acquired from the following equation:  ( ) 0lim *t t  CI P CI ??  =   (9)  where ( )tP is the t-step transition probability matrix which is the t-power of P .

From literature [21-23], we know that if the transition probability matrix P is irreducible and non-periodic,  ( ) 0lim *t t  CI P CI ??  = will converge to a stationary distribution CI.

From definition 1, 3, 4, 5 and equation (7), we can see that the matrix P is positive transition matrix, hence, matrix P is irreducible and non-periodic [24], therefore, CI will converge to a reasonable value.

D. Validation of  CIAM-MCM To measure the rationality of community influence gained by CIAM-MCM, we design a simple heuristic node-selection strategy, and use the chosen nodes to perform the simulation experiments of influence spreading under the Independent Cascade Model (IC) [25-26].

Independent Cascade Model. The basic concepts and procedure of independent cascade model is described in the following.

The process starts with an initial set of active nodes, and then unfolds in discrete steps according to the following randomized rules. When vertex v  first becomes active in step t , it is given a single chance to activate each currently inactive neighbor w ; it succeeds with a probability p  which is the system parameter, and the process is independent of the history states hitherto. If w has multiple newly activated neighbors, their attempts are sequenced in an arbitrary order. If v succeeds, then w will become active in step 1t + ; but whether or not v succeeds, it cannot make any further attempts to activate w in the subsequent rounds. Again, it runs until no more activations are possible in the process.

The Node-Selection Strategy. The strategy proposed is referred to as Community Influence Method (CI-Method) which main idea is choosing nodes considering the community influence. The steps of CI-Method  are as follows:  Step 1. Normalize the community influence, and then take it as the probability of choosing community when selecting one node.

Step 2. Choose the one community according to the probability gained by Step 1, then select a node with bigger degree inside the community chosen.

Step 3. Repeat the above process, of course, avoid to select the repeated node.



IV. EXPERIMENT RESULTS AND ANALYSIS In this section, experiments of simulating the influence  spreading are performed for the purpose of validating the reasonability of the proposed community analysis influence model CIAM-MCM. We also analyze the distribution of the community influence. The experiments are run on a server with 2.7GHz Dual-Core Intel CPU and 3G memory.

A. Datasets Five social network datasets are adopted to conduct the experiments, i.e. America College Football dataset [13], P2P- Gnutella08 dataset [27], NetHEPT dataset [7], NetPHY dataset [7], and Email-Enron [28-29]. The statistical parameters of the five datasets if listed in Table I.

America College Football. The football network is a representation of the schedule of Division I games for the 2000 season: in the graph, the teams are represented as vertices, and regular-season games between every two teams is represented as the edges [13].

P2P-Gnutella08. This is a typical P2P network: interconnected, file-sharing peers can issue queries for files, if peers which receive the query and are able to respond it, one edge is constructed [27].

NetHEPT and NetPHY. This two academic collaboration networks are from two different sections of the e-print arXiv1.

The nodes represent the authors, and edges between a pair of nodes represent collaboration relationship. The NetHEPT dataset comes from the ?High Energy Physics ? Theory? section whose papers is from 1991 to 2003. The NetPHY dataset comes from the full paper list of the section ?Physics? [7].

Email-Enron. This is an email network from Enron and from a large European research organization. The nodes represent the individual users most of which is senior management of Enron and edges represent communication between pairs of those users [28-29].

Analysis of  the Community Influence Distribution Through CIAM-MCM, we calculate the community influence of each dataset, the distribution of influence is depicted as the Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 below.

The community influence distribution of Amerian College Football, NetHEPT, NetPHY, P2P-Gnutella08 and Email-Enron.

It can be seen from Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 that the five datasets besides the America College Football dataset have a common character, each dataset has a few communities with very high influence, and some communities with a relative high influence, and most communities with a low influence. It is most obvious in the dataset P2P-Gnutella08. The America College Football dataset is abnormal because of the small quantity of the communities, but it is still can been seen that the Football dataset has a community with much higher influence than the other communities, and most communities has very low influence.

C. The Rationality Analysis of Community Influence We intend to compare the influence spread of the proposed CI-Method with some classic influence maximization algorithms under the Independent Cascade model (IC), and the algorithms include Degree-Discount algorithm and Degree Heuristic.

The Results of Influence Spread of Five Datasets. The results are showed in the following figures.

We summarize our experiment results for Independent Cascade Model and discuss their implications. We use the proposed CI-Method and two other various heuristic algorithms to select the seed nodes. Then we exert the different seed sets selected to run the simulation experiments.

The diffusion probability p of IC used in the experiments is 0.1, and for all the datasets, the size of seed sets is from 1 to 100.

The influence spreads of the proposed CI-Method, Degree and Degree-Discount [7] under the Independent Cascade Model are reported in Fig. 3-7.

According to the above influence spread figures, we can see that the CI-Method performs much better than the Degree heuristic in all the five datasets. Compared to Degree-Discount, the result of CI-Method is not worse in America College Football dataset, and better in P2P-Gnutell8 dataset, NetHEP dataset , and Email-Enron dataset. In the NetPHY dataset CI- Method is a little worse than Degree-Discount.

Notice that the disparity of  influence spreads is not obvious when the size of seed set is relatively small. But it is not always this case, the performance of CI-Method becomes better when the size of seed set gets bigger.

We also run the simulation experiments under the diffusion probability 0.2p = . Just For the influence spread, the relative performance and the general changing trend are consistent with the case which using the diffusion probability 0.1p = .

In conclusion, the results of simulation experiments indicate that the CI-Method which considering the community influence stem from CIAM-MCM is an efficient node-selection     strategy with high-performance, simultaneously, it also proves that the proposed model CIAM-MCM is rational.



V. CONCLUSION Through generalizing user level influence to community  level influence, a novel model of analyzing community influence using Markov Chains in social networks is proposed, and we analyze the character of distribution of the community influence, then we validate the rationality of the community influence gained from the proposed model CIAM-MCM through the experiments of influence spreading under the Independent Cascade Model, and the results show the efficiency of the CI-Method, moreover, the rationality of the community influence is proved.
