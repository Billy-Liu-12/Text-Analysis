Coordinated Data Acquisition on Sensor Websl2

Abstract This paper focuses on the application of automated planning, scheduling, and plan execution to Earth science campaigns, an organized sequence of observations and data analysis activities associated with an Earth science objective. We propose a layered architecture for coordinating sensing assets, and describe a process for automatically transforming science goals (such as monitoring a volcano or other Earth process) into sequences of data acquisitions.
