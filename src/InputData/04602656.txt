Win32 Based Sensor for Email Auditing

Abstract? At present time email became a part of enter- prise culture and contains big amount of company?s intellec- tual property. But improper use of email may lead to leak- age of sensitive information and other problems. One of the ways to prevent this is to use outgoing email auditing. One of the main parts of this process is email sensor. The paper describes a model and Win32 implementation of network sensor for this aim. Sensor captures data directly from net- work traffic, parses it, extracts email information and sends to a control unit. Device is intended for enterprise email auditing systems.



I. INTRODUCTION Email is one of the main ways of electronic communi-  cations for enterprises and its importance continues to grow [1]. Employees send each other huge amount of dif- ferent information. But not all of sent emails help to en- terprise?s business. The brightest illustration of negative email usage is leakage of sensitive information. Thus, to prevent that and to increase employee efficiency, employ- ers use email auditing (also called email monitoring) and email filtering [2-4]. In this paper we discuss a sensor for email auditing systems. They could be divided into two groups.  The first one uses special software modules, em- bedded into enterprise email server. It lets not only to ex- amine outgoing emails but to filter them. But this method is insensitive for emails that use not corporative email server. Another group extracts and examines emails cap- tured from communication lines. This way lets to audit all kind of emails but doesn?t let to filter them.

In this paper we present a model of sensor for email au- diting and its implementation for Win32 platform. Device is designed for mail services that use SMTP, POP3, and IMAP4 protocols for data transfer. It captures email in- formation and transmits to remote control unit. Collected data may be used as for information security aims as for email service study and optimization.



II. A MODEL OF THE SENSOR A model of the sensor was built on the base of number  of demands, which were derived from its practical imple- mentation. They include:  1) extraction of email messages from monitored traffic according to established criteria;  2) transmission of collected information to sensor control unit for storage and further analysis;  3) availability of sensor  remote control channel for parameters tuning and device status reports;  4) transparency for objects of monitored network and external agents;  5) visualization of monitoring process.

Structured and functional model of the sensor was created according to the above-stated demands. It consists of the following main components (??????! ???????? ?????? ?? ??????.):  1) information capture unit (ICU); 2) analyzer of sessions (AS); 3) data transmission unit (DTU); 4) remote control unit (RCU); 5) visualization and control unit (VCU).

Information capture unit receives IP-frame from moni- tored network and puts it into incoming buffer of analyzer of sessions. On the base of input frames analyzer of ses- sions forms sequences of SMTP, POP3, and IMAP4 ap- plication protocols messages. Parsing these sequences AS finds and extracts emails. Pure emails are transferred to data transmission unit. DTU sends them to sensor remote control center. Center is able to tune sensor (for example to set different filters for data capturing) by sending in- structions to remote control unit. RCU receives them and transfer to visualization and control unit for execution.

VCU is central binding module. It starts up sensor, makes primary initialization, executes remote commands and visualizes information from all other modules.



III. WIN32 IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SENSOR We implemented email audit sensor, based on above  described model, on Win32 platform. According to in- structions, obtained from its control center, device extracts email messages from input stream and sends them to au- diting system for subsequent analysis. The task of the sys- tem is to detect messages with unwanted or dangerous contents which are sent either from outside or from inside of monitored zone.

The sensor represents itself a computer equipped with two network adapters running special-purpose software in Windows XP operating system environment. Special- purpose software implements above described model as five concurrent streams. Computer of sensor is maintained close to company?s network equipment that provides in-  286 IEEE REGION 8 SIBIRCON 2008     terface to external network. One of the sensor?s adapters is connected to this equipment so that it has capability to ?listen? company?s traffic. Another adapter is connected to sensor remote control center.  Using this channel sensor receives control instructions and sends its own status in- formation and captured email messages. Remote control center accumulates and analyses this information which is necessary for email service estimation.

This sensor was tested in 100Mbit network environ- ment, consisting of about 100 computers. Traffic captur- ing adapter of device was connected to gateway which connects enterprise network with external network (Fig.

We used ordinary personal computers for sensor and sensor remote control center, each one equipped with Pen- tium IV 3Ghz processor, 512Mbytes of memory and Win- dows XP operating system. Device workability was tested in conditions of daily ordinary workload. For task compli- cation short-term peaks of workload were artificially added to ordinary traffic, including emails with attach- ments of up to 10Mbytes. Sensor worked without failures during several days of testing period successfully extract- ing email messages from traffic of average size company.



IV. CONCLUSION We implemented email audit sensor on Win32 platform, based on above described model. It helps to study and to audit email traffic of a company when connected to re- search or audit system. As a result of device testing it?s possible to make following conclusions. Sensor?s avail- ability was confirmed as in daily workload as in peak con- ditions. Suggested model is rather universal. It may be used for other kinds of telecommunication traffic (for ex- ample HTTP, FTP, and so on). Usage of special-purpose hardware for traffic capturing and primary sorting may lead to increase of sensor performance.
