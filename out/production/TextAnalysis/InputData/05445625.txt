INORM: A new approach in e-commerce recommendation

Abstract Developing an intelligent recommendation  system is a good way to overcome the problem of  overloaded products information provided by the e-  commerce enterprises. This paper proposes a new  hybrid recommendation methodology, called INORM,  based on recommendation methods and costumer  navigational and behavioral algorithms to enhance the  recommendation quality and the system performance of  current recommender systems.

I. INTRODUCTION  Recommender systems are used by E-commerce  sites to suggest products to their customers and to  provide consumers with information to help them  determine which products to purchase.

The forms of recommendation include suggesting  products to the consumer, providing personalized  product information, summarizing community  opinion, and providing community critiques. The  purpose of personalized information services is to  adjust strategies of promotion and advertisement to fit  customer interests. New enterprises can deal with a  particular customers Web experiences by providing  customer personalization service and communicating  or interacting with customers. Such understandings of  customers can be transformed customer information  into quality services or products [1]. [2]  In this paper we try to introduce some  recommender methods such as Collaborative Filtering,  WRFM, Web CF-AR and some hybrid approaches,    and present their advantages and problems.    After  introducing the product recommendation methods, this  paper introduces a new method known as "INORM"  that applies the advantages of various present  methods. The INORM method has empirically been  analyzed and compared with some current methods.

This method, showing a minimal qualitative  improvement of 56.25% considering the present  methods of product suggestion, has radically  revolutionized the ecommerce product suggestions of  today using costumer navigational and behavioral  algorithms. This method also gives different optimal  recommendations to the costumers with minimizing  the sellers intervene.



II. RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS  Recommender systems are technologies that assist  businesses to implement one-to-one marketing  strategies. Recommender systems have emerged in e-  commerce applications to support product  recommendation [3], which provide individual  marketing decisions for each customer [4].

Recommender systems rely on customer purchase  history to determine customer preferences and to  identify products that customers may purchase.

Supporting product recommendation services can  strengthen the relationship between the buyer and  seller and thus increase profit. [3] [5] Recommender  systems enhance E-commerce sales in some ways:  helping customers find products they wish to  purchase; converting browsers into buyers; improving  cross-sell by suggesting additional products for the  customer to purchase; improving loyalty by creating a  value- added relationship between the site and the  customer [6].

A. collaborative filtering method  Although a variety of recommendation techniques  has been developed recently, collaborative filtering  (CF) has been known to be the most successful  recommendation technique and has been used in a  number of different applications such as  recommending web pages, movies, articles and  products [7, 8, 9]. The CF assumes that a good way to    find a certain customers interesting content is to find  other people who have similar interests with him/her.

The goal of the CF is to suggest new items or to  predict the utility of a certain item for a particular user  based on the users previous likings and the opinions  of other like-minded users [10][11]   978-0-7695-3982-9/10 $26.00  2010 IEEE  DOI 10.1109/ICCEA.2010.167   B. WebCF-AR method  A model-based recommendation methodology is  WebCF-AR1  that addresses the sparsity and the  scalability problems of existing CF-based  recommender systems. Web usage mining analyzes  customers shopping behaviors on the Web and  collects their implicit ratings. This increases the  number of ratings rather than obtaining subjective  ratings, thereby reduces the sparsity [12][13]  C. weighted RFM- based method  Although various approaches for making  recommendations have been presented, few consider  customer lifetime value (CLV) and the effect on  product recommendations. Firms are increasingly  recognizing the importance of the lifetime value of  customers [14]. Generally, RFM (Recency,  Frequency, and Monetary) method has been used to  measure CLV [15,16].In fiercely competitive  environments, identifying the CLV or loyalty ranking  of customer segments is important for helping  decision makers to target markets more clearly. [17]  D. Association Rule Mining  Given a set of transactions where each transaction  is a set of items (item set), an association  rule implies  a knowledge or pattern in the form of  X => Y , where  X and Y are item sets; X and Y are called the body and  the head, respectively. Association rule mining is the  discovery of all association rules that are above a user-  specified minimum support and minimum confidence.

[19,18, 20, 21] [13]  E. WebCF-PT method  WebCF-PT2 is a recommendation methodology    based on Web usage mining and the product  taxonomy to improve the recommendation quality and  the system performance of current CF-based  recommender systems. The overall procedure of  WebCF-PT is divided into four phases: grain  specification, customer profile creation, neighborhood  formation, and recommendation generation. The input  data consist of Web server log files, product database,  customer database and purchase database. The  endmost output is the personalized product  recommendation list.

III. INORM METHOD  INORM method is a brand new and inventive  method in which costumers' background is  investigated, considering what increase the quality of  prediction and recommendation and then predicts and  recommends the goods they may buy. In this method  the advantages of both collaborating filtering method  and content base method, based on the products and  characteristics are used. Recommendations are chosen  according to desired costumers, as well as what the  costumer had loved more before.  Moreover grouping  and categorizing the products in the same  characterized groups, removes the separation  problems such as distribution and time wasting  features. Also, the usage of goods characteristics after  collaborating filtering grouping is used in ending steps  of prediction and recommendation which is another  way to make the procedure better.  This matter  prepares the possibility of recommending new goods  to the costumer. This is one of most important  advantages of INORM method which can find better  market for goods, beside the current method. INROM  method uses the advantages of at least six methods  and pays attention to some characters such as locality,  Regency and Frequency of references and so on. For  verifying this method, in the Ghazal department    store3 with different costumer and condition, INORM  has executed and the result has shown that the  INORM method will increase the ability of predictions  and recommendations to more than 25.56 percent. The  INORM recommendation method is made of 10 steps  in which of them, the characteristics of several former  recommendation methods are covered simultaneously.

In the next section these steps are explained.



IV. METHODOLOGIES  Phase 1: Grain Specification  In this phase, we identify similar products and group  them together using product taxonomy so as to reduce  the product space. [22], [23], [26]  Phase 2: Customer Preference Analysis  INORM applies the results of analyzing the  preferences of each customer to make  recommendations. For this purpose, we propose a  customer preference model represented by a matrix.

The customer preference model is constructed based  the following three general shopping steps in Web  retailers: Click through4, Basket Placement5,  Purchase6. So we can classify all products into four  product groups such as purchased products, products  placed in the basket, products clicked through, and the  3 Ghazal department store, Neshabour, Iran, Manager: Mrs.

Mahnaz Ghafarian  4 the click on and the view of the Web page of the product  5 the placement of the product in the shopping basket  6 the purchase of the product   other products. From the above terminology, we  define the customer preference matrix  P = ( pij) , I = 1,    , m ( total number of  customers), j = 1,    , n( total number of grain  product classes, i. e., | G | ), as follows:  c  ijp >0o     ?? mi pij  p  ij  m  i  b    ij  b  ij  m  i  c  ij  c  ij  ij  p  p  p  p  p  p  p   c  ijp d 0o 0 ijp  ijp implies that the preference of customer i across  every products in a grain product j depends on the  normalized value of total number of occurrences of  click-troughs, basket placement and purchases. It  ranges from 0 to 3, where more preferred product  results in bigger value. [13]  Phase 3: determination of goal costumer for  recommendation  Phase 4: The similarity of preferences among  customers can be measured in various ways. A  common method is to compute the Pearson correlation  coefficient defined as below.

Moreover, the variable i denotes the  group of products. Additionally, the rci,s and rcj,s  indicates whether customer's ci and cj purchased  group of products (items). [11], [24], [22]  Phase 5: The RFM values of each customer are  normalized. The normalized RFM [17] values of each  customer are then multiplied by the relative  importance of RFM variables, wR, wF and wM, which  are determined by the AHP7. The similarity among  customers can be measured by computing the Pearson  correlation coefficient based on the weighted RFM  values of customers, as defined in below.

The variable V denotes the set of RFM  variables. The variables  and  which is s indicate the weighted value R (F or M) of  customer ci and cj.

K-means technique is  employed to cluster customers based on the integrated  correlation coefficients. The centroid of a cluster is  represented by both the average WRFM values and  the average purchase preferences of customers within  the cluster. Customers are assigned to a cluster with  maximum integrated correlation coefficient. [5]  Phase 7: we define the customer and his/her  neighbors preference matrix  P = (P1j) , i = 1,    , m ( total number of customers), j  = 1,    , n( total number of grain product classes, i. e.,  | G | ), as follows:  u?u?u mi pijmi bijmi cijj PPPP 1111 JED    P1j implies that the preference of the goal customer  and his/her neighbors across every product in a grain  product j depends on the normalized value of total  number of occurrences of click- through, basket  placement and purchases. P1j is a 1n matrix. [27]  Phase 8: Product Association Analysis  In this phase, we first search for meaningful  relationships or associations among grain product  classes through mining association rules from the  large transactions. In order to capture the customers  shopping inclination more accurately, we look for  association rules from three different transaction sets:  purchase transaction set, basket placement transaction  set and click-through transaction set. This work results  in building a model called product association model  represented by a matrix. A product association matrix  A = (aij), i, j = 1,   , n (total number of grain product  classes) is defined as follows: [5], [13], [26]  ?

A personalized  recommendation list for a specific customer is  produced by scoring the degree of similarity between  the associations of each grain product class and their  preferences and by selecting the best scores. Cosine  coefficient [7] is used to measure the similarity. The  matching score sij between the same group customers  and a grain product class j is computed as followings:       n  k  kj  n  k  ik  n  k  kjik  j  i  j  i  ij  ap  ap  AP  APS      1  [22, 13, 24]  Where Pi is the row vector of the 1  n customer    preference matrix, and Aj is the j- th column vector of  the n  n product association matrix A. Here, n refers  the total number of grain product classes. The sij value  ranges from 0 to 1, where more similar vector results  in bigger value. [22], [24]  Phase 10: The 9th phase implies the higher  preference of grain product classes for group of the  goal costumer. Hence, in that case, we have to choose  which products in this grain product class have the  highest reference frequency and recommend them to  the costumer.

A. Detection of the results of execution of this  method in a sample department store.

To determine the ability of the INORM method it  was necessary to find a database of a department store.

The costumer's shopping detailed list of the Ghazal  department store in 2005 was entered the software,  designed based on the INORM method, negotiating  with that store, there were 41 costumers with different  reference frequencies and different shopping.

Costumers were from different ranges of long time  and short time background with deference frequencies  of high and low and also high and low money  spending capacities and etc. In this database there are  108 different goods and based on the requests these  goods are categorized in 21 different categories. The  store manager was also asked to form the association  matrix of goods, according to her experiences.

Regarding the market and costumer's condition, the  store manager determines the wRFM and wP  coefficients and considers them as 0.5. She is also  asked to determine the wR, wF and wM, coefficients  which are considered as 2, 3 and 3 in order they are  named above. [5]  B. Experimental metrics  Two metrics, precision and recall, are commonly used  to measure the quality of recommendation. [5],[17]  itemserestingofnumber  itemsdrecommendecorrectlyofnumbercall  int  Re  itemsdrecommendeofnumber    itemsdrecommendecorrectlyofnumberecision  Pr  An F1-metric can be used to balance the trade-off  between precision and recall.

F1-metric assigns equal weight to precision and recall,  and is given by  precisionrecall  precisionrecallF ?  uu 21   [24]  Notably, each metric is computed for each customer,  and the average value computed for each cluster, as  well as the overall average (over all customers) is  taken as measures of the quality of the  recommendation. [17], [13],[5]  C. Experimental results  With mentioned preparations, 3 manners are  considered for execution in which the  recommendations are calculated in collaborating  filtering and WRFM methods, beside the INORM  method. The results are represented here in two tables.

TABLE  I. Comparison of recommendation  quality in tests  TABLE  II. comparison of recommendation  leading to purchase, determining the number of  recommendations in tests  Number  of equal  F1s  Number  of  larger  F1s  Percentage  of F1 to be  larger  Percentage  of F1 to be  larger or  equal  Comparison  of INORM  with  WRFM    5 25 78.125 93.75  Comparison  of INORM  with CF  13 18 56.25 96.875  Number  of  recommendation  9 12 15 20  Percentage of  increasing correct  recommendation  comparing with WRFM  75 87.5 75 75  Percentage of  increasing correct  recommendation  comparing with WRFM  62.5 62.5 50 50  Numbers of recommendations are considered as 9, 12,  15 and 20.The recommendation quality is also  calculated for each recommendation. For this purpose,  calculation the recommendation quality, the database  should be divided into learning and recommendation  data, in this research about 20 percent of information  aren't entered to database in order to ask  recommendation and then compare them to the true  information based on the costumers' name in this  method's information. The simulated software answer  in three manners (INORM, WRFM and CF) were  investigated in diagrams after 128 times of executions,  after that the result are analyzed and investigated. To  compare the observed statistics of INORM method  with two method which are collaborating filtering and  WRFM, one can refer to the table 1.

At this observed INORM method increase the  quality of recommendation to costumer in comparison  with the collaborating filtering to 56.25 percent and  represent it in 96.87 equal or better. In the same way  in comparison of INORM with WRFM method  increase the recommendation quality to 78.12.

The priority of INORM method comparing to  other ones is obvious now, but we investigated the  manner representing recommendation in INORM  more regarding the number of recommendations.

The case in which the numbers of recommendation are  9 the recommendations leading to purchase in  INORM method causes 75 percent increase. In CF  method such as INORM method, the number of  recommendations has 62.5 percent increases in ability  of them. After doing tests for more recommendation,  the results are represented in table 2, which is a great  success for INORM method to have more ability than  the old methods.



V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION  this article tried to tell the strength and weakness  point of the recommendations method in electronic  commerce, introducing a new method named INORM  which uses the advantages of six current method and  weakened their deficiencies , in order to have a new  step in good recommendation executing INORM  method for recommending to the costumers of a  database of a store and its comparison with the  recommendations represented by CF method and  WRFM , at least 78.125 percent comparing to WRFM  and 56.25 percent comparing to CF methods, increase  had observed. The INORM method also takes  costumer behaviors patterns into account to be useful  for all kind of electronic commerce.
