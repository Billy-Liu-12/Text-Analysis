A Hierarchical Shot Detection Method for MPEG Video

Abstract?Video shot detection is a current hot research area.

For MPEG video, it is impossible to quick analyze and retrieval through methods of full decompression owning to big computation. Here a hierarchical shot detection method is proposed. Firstly we make use of motion vectors in P-frame and B-frame to detect the potential frames , then determine the last results through computing the difference between DC-images. The experimental results show that this method needs a few calculations and has higher precision ratio.

I. INTRODUCTION With the accumulation of video monitoring, VOD and  TV programs, there are more and more video resources available. How to search and extract needed video data is becoming so important. More and more researchers throw themselves into the video retrieval research.

As a special information presentation pattern, commonly video data size is big than other traditional media, and video contain abundant information content, so it is hard to extract the semantics of them. Methods of manual marking and segmentation are inefficient, they cannot meet the requirement of handling big data size. For vide retrieval, the usually implementation is through steps as below.

Firstly, cutting the video into video shots on the basis of video content, and assigning a key frame for per shot. Then extracting the feature data of key frames, clustering all key frames through computing the feature data difference and storing the results to database. At last users construct queries.

It allows users to submit query based on the feature data and return the results in some form. In the process, We can see that cutting videos and feature extraction are two key factors influencing the accuracy of video retrieval.. So, it is very important to attain quick and efficient video shot segmentation. But the problem is that it is hard to represent in quantification for the data used for determining the change[1]. How to recognize the difference between frames in quantification and how to choose the threshold are key problems in current research.



II. SHOT CUT RECOGNITION Shot cut recognition is the basis of high level video  segment such as scene segment. There are three sorts of recognition methods:  Methods are based on decompressed full images sequence;  Methods are based on compressed video; Methods are based on determination  transformation model; On the contrast, the first method is inefficient because it  needs more computation on decompressed video, yet the second method can attain a higher processing speed owing to the lower data rate. So most researchers focus on the methods based on MPEG compressed video. But at present most research is only making use of low level feature data of image [2,3]. Some researchers propose methods which use the DC coefficients changes of I-frame and P-frame and motion vectors to recognize the shot cut. Sethi and Patel only use the DC coefficients of I-frame to implement luminance histogram hypothesis test[4], the premise of this method is presuming that the difference of two I-frames is little and fixed. Another researchers use the information in P-frame and B-frame to implement video scene cut detection[5]. Some researchers found that when P-frame and  B-frame is near the boundary between different shots, the motion vectors number would be less. The disadvantage of methods  based on motion vectors is that the motion information would be uncertainly and unpredictable.

Here we introduce a new method for video shot recognition which is based on the DC-image[6] and motion vectors.



III. DC-IMAGE For a 8?8 image block, its DC coefficient can be avail  through the formula as below:   ?? = =  =     ),( 1)0,0(  x x  yxfC (1)    In equation (1), x and  y present the image block pixel coordinates, f(x, y) is the value of a pixel which is located at coordinate(x, y). C(0, 0) is the DC coefficient of the image block.

For a image consists of M?N blocks, its DC-image can be composed of DC coefficients of all blocks. When a full image is compressed into a DC-image, the ratio is 64:1.

Cai Li-Hua   V12-79C978-1-4244-7237-6/$26.00     2010 IEEE     Figure 1.Original image and its DC-image   In Figure 1, we can conclude that though the DC-image  is much smaller than its original image, but it looks like the original image very much. It shows that the DC-image keeps the basic feature information of original image. So some features which have been used on original images can be applied to DC-images. With regard to DC-image, the main advantage is that we can acquire DC-images of all frames without decompressing video. Thus, video data needed to be handled is much less, and the accuracy is not be affected much owing to the high level semblance between original image and DC-image.



IV. SHOT CUT RECOGNITION IN I,P,B FRAME In compressed MPEG video stream, the general method  is that detecting the potential shot cuts based on the statistical information of motion vectors[7].

In MPEG standard specification, there is a I-frame in per GOP. I-frame consists of DC coefficients and AC coefficients after DCT, it can be decompressed independently. There is no motion information in I-frame because I-frame adopts intraframe compression way. When the shot cut occurs in one I-frame, data of preceding frame before it must be used. If the difference between these two adjacent frames reach to a peak value, we may make a conclusion that the I-frame is a potential shot cut frame. In addition, when shot cut occurs in one I-frame, the amount of forward prediction macro blocks in preceding B-frame will be a peak value because this B-frame references the success frame much more.

Shot cut detection in P-frames and B-frames can adopt methods similar to I-frames. Through comparing the difference between successive frames to determine if there is a shot cut. But it is inefficient and inconsiderate to computing difference in whole situation and ignoring the motion vectors. Thus using the statistical information of motion vectors in P-frame and B-frames is necessary.

There are two kinds of macro blocks in P-frame. One is intra macro block, another is forward predicted macro block.

If there is a shot cut in P-frame, it mean that this P-frame cannot reference the preceding frame much, so the amount of intra-block will reach a peak.

With regard to B-frame, there are three kinds of macro blocks. Excepts the two in P-frame , another one is backward predicted macro block. If shot cut occurs in one  B-frame, it mean that the main part of reference information of this B-frame is from the successive frame. Commonly the ratio of amount of backward and forward macro blocks is used to judge the result.



V. HIERARCHICAL SHOT RECOGNITION METHOD Though methods that only using the difference between  successive frames can acquire a preferable segment result, but they need more computation and ignore important motion information. At the same time, in research we found that the amount of macro blocks in P-frame and B-frame conform to the law as said above in most situations, but there still exists exceptions in few situations. Here we introduce a hierarchical method to avoid side-effect of unilateral methods. Firstly we use statistical data of motion vectors in P and B frames to detect all potential frames quickly. Then the difference between successive frames method is adopted to get rid of some wrong judges. Our method needs to scan the video twice. About difference computation , we make use of full image difference formula.

It can also be applied to DC-image. DC-image of I-frame is composed of DC coefficients of original image directly.

Also we can use fast algorithm to acquire DC-image of B-frame and P-frame.

The difference formula is:      )||(),( ,  ,? ?= ji  a ijji YXfYXd  (2) In equation(2), D(X, Y) presents difference between X  and Y. X and Y are DC-images of two frames. ? is usually be 1 or 2.

Difference between frames in same shot will be minor.

When the value of difference is greater than a assigned threshold, we can conclude that image content changes much and there is a shot cut.

In video sequence temporal segmentation, how to choose an appropriate threshold is a key problem related to promoting the accuracy.

The assigned threshold must be adapt to the changes amplitude for a high level detecting accuracy. It mean that we need to adjust threshold according to the input[8]. Here we adopt a method based on interval threshold. When we scan the video at the first time, we record the difference of all I-frames at the same time. Then a statistical method based on these data is used to determine thresholds. We divide the video sequence into N intervals, a threshold SDi {i=1,2,3?,N}is assigned for a interval.. The length of interval is not fixed. Through this way, we can reduce the wrong judgments as far as possible.



V. EXPERIMENT In order to test the performance of our method, we apply  it on several different video source. Here we only present the segment result of the MTV ?Daoxiang? of ?Zhoujielun?.

Step 1: check out all potential frames according to motion vectors information quickly.

Step 2: determine the final result through computing difference.

V12-80    Step 3: result presentation. we divide the whole video into several shots, a key frame is assigned for per shot.

In figure 2, we show part of key frames in DC-image pattern.

Through a manual confirming process, we find some inaccurate places in segments. One reason is that there is gradual change situation. Another reason is the limitation of threshold assignment process.



VI. SUMMARY It needs semantic comprehension of video content to  acquire 100 percentage shot cut recognition accuracy. It is impossible to achieve because the limitation of current computer science and technologies. Our method is based on low level feature data, but it achieve good performance thanks to the sufficient information usage. Next we should explore new methods to get rid of wrong judges based on this method. In one word, how to use the high level feature data to segment and retrieval is difficult and hot.
