Abstract ? In public distribution networks the distribution  network operator (DNO) is responsible for the voltage quality at all points of supply. In Europe the DNO have to guarantee speci- fied values for voltage quality parameters according to EN 50160 [1]. Due to the wide use of electronics in electrical equipment and installations as well as the increase of dispersed generation, the disturbances on the supply network and their assessment is an important issue for the DNO. While the emissions of smaller equipment in LV networks (rated currents below 16A) are lim- ited by appropriate standards (IEC 61000-3-x), the connection of larger installations (load and generation) or a bulk of small but identical devices has to be approved by the DNO as the case arises. The "Technical Rules for Assessment of Network Distur- bances" (TR) [2] contain guidelines for the approval of connec- tion inquiries in low and medium voltage networks.

Starting about 30 years ago different recommendations and principles for the assessment of network disturbances was devel- oped in the four countries Austria (A), Switzerland (CH), Ger- many (D) and Czech Republic (CZ). In 2004, after 3 years of development, a joint version of the TR was released by the re- spective associations of the four countries based on correspond- ing resolutions. The TR is widely used by the DNO of the four countries. In December 2007 the second edition of the TR was published.

The paper gives an overview of the contents of this revised edition. It describes the principles of the assessment procedures and the underlying philosophies. For the most important distur- bances the assessment procedures are described in more detail.

Several examples demonstrate the application of the TR.

I.  INTRODUCTION ue to the wide application of non-linear equipment and installations (load and generation) at all network levels  disturbances occur on the networks. These disturbances di- rectly decrease the voltage quality, which may lead to mal- functions or damages of the equipment. All parties (customer, manufacturer, DNO) have interest to ensure, that  - Emissions of an installation do not disturb other equip- ment (Electromagnetic Compatibility)   U.

J. Zierlinger is with EVN Netz GmbH, Jahnstr. 29, 3100 St.P?lten, Austria (e-mail: Josef.Zierlinger@evn.at)   - Voltage quality meets the increasing demand of modern  electronic equipment - High quality levels are maintained, in particular under  the changing generating structure.

For this reasons, the DNO must have the possibility of  keeping the disturbances caused by electrical installations within tolerable limits.

Individual electrical equipment or installations, which comply with the technical supply conditions of the DNO, can be connected to the network without inquiry. Otherwise or in the case of an accumulation of similar types of devices a con- nection assessment by the DNO is necessary. The TR provide uniform methods for the assessment of network disturbances in low and medium voltage networks based on the limiting values or recommended values in actual standards (cf. IEC 61000, EN 50160).

The given methods are intentional designed with some simplifications to increase the easiness and efficiency of their application as well as to avoid unnecessary conservative re- sults. Therefore the calculations for each individual case rather represent a good estimation, which has to be critically rated by the DNO. Especially in the case of unusual conditions (i.e.

network resonances, large amount of small but identical de- vices) a remaining risk exists, that the calculations result in too high values. Therefore it is recommended to perform meas- urements before and after the connection of the considered in- stallation to check the compliance with the applicable standards. That way a customer has to install suitable correc- tive measures only in the case of a real exceeding of given limits. The rights and duties to achieve compliance with given limits should already be regulated in the connection agreement between customer and DNO.

Actually the draft of the technical report IEC 61000-3-14 [3] is circulated. This report also deals with the assessment of emission limits for disturbing loads in low voltage networks.

The basic principles of the methods used in both guides for emission co-ordination are virtually identical. Compared to the TR the methods in [3] are more flexible, but therefore a bit more difficult to apply. In particular more input data are nec- essary in [3], which sometimes has to be estimated, if they are not available. Due to more fixed assumptions the equations in the TR are usually simpler but more fixed compared to [3].

Actually a detailed comparison of both guidelines will be pre- pared to determine how consistent the results are.

Methods for the Assessment of Network Distur- bances in Distribution Networks  J. Meyer, U. Ammeter, J. Hanzlik, and J. Zierlinger  D      A.  Overview of contents The first chapter describes the relation between Electro-  magnetic Compatibility and Power Quality. Further it lists the statutory regulations at European and individual state level that provide the basis for the development and application of the TR.

Chapter 2 contains about 80 definitions, which are relevant for the TR. In most cases the definitions are taken from the In- ternational Electrotechnical Vocabulary [4], the European standard EN 50160 or international standards dealing with EMC. Several definitions have been supplemented or speci- fied more precisely.

Chapter 3 explains the calculation of Short-Circuit Imped- ance and Short-circuit Power respectively. The Short-Circuit Power at the Point of Common Coupling (PCC) provides the basis for all further calculations of network disturbances.

Chapters 4 to 9 systematically present the network distur- bances and their assessment sorted by the disturbance type.

Following disturbance types are considered:  - Chapter 4 Voltage Changes and Flicker - Chapter 5 Voltage Unbalance - Chapter 6 Harmonics - Chapter 7 Commutation Notches - Chapter 8 Interharmonic Voltages - Chapter 9 Interference of ripple control systems  Most of these chapters consist of several subchapters dealing with:  - Theoretical background information - Applicable emission limits - Assessment procedure - Compensation methods - Detailed examples  Chapter 10 deals with the special issues of dispersed gener- ating units. In addition to the typical disturbances known from loads (e.g. flicker, harmonics and commutation notches) char- acteristic disturbances of generating units are considered: volt- age rise, connection-related voltage change and single-phase  connection.

Beside literature and abbreviations the annex contains a  data sheet for the assessment of network disturbances, which has to be filled out and submitted by the customer to the DNO together with the connection inquiry.



II.  NETWORK IMPEDANCE Each network disturbance has to be assessed at the point of  common coupling (PCC). Basis for any calculations is the short-circuit impedance (or short-circuit power) at the PCC.

Contrary to the calculation of short-circuit currents for dimen- sioning equipment, for the assessment of network disturbances those normal operating conditions have to be considered that produce the lowest short-circuit power, which means the high- est short-circuit impedance. The calculation finally gives magnitude and phase angle of the short-circuit impedance at the PCC Zk PCC.

Due to the main focus of TR on low voltage networks only the series impedance components of the network elements are considered. Parallel components (i.e. line capacities) as well as damping influences due to other loads connected to the grid will be neglected. Especially in MV-networks, but under spe- cial circumstances also in LV-networks, resonances may occur (i.e. due to large cable networks or non-detuned capacitor banks). That issue has to be paid special attention by the DNO, especially for calculation of harmonic emission limits.

Fig. 1 gives an example for the calculation of Zk PCC in a low voltage network. The colored bars show, that the imped- ance at the PCC is mainly determined by the MV/LV- transformer T2 and the cable L2 (more than 95 %). That's why the solely consideration of MV/LV-transformer impedance and the impedances of LV lines results in sufficient exact val- ues for Zk PCC for disturbance assessments in low voltage net- works. Only in the case of a PCC direct or near the LV-busbar as well as long lines in the MV-network the calculation must take the impedances of all network components into account.

III.  VOLTAGE CHANGES AND FLICKER  A.  Basics The calculation of relative voltage change d for symmetri-  cal load changes is based on the following equation:  ( )A k PCC V k PCC  SUd cos U S  ??= ? ? ? ? ?  (1)  ?SA Load change (apparent power change) in kVA ? Angle of the load change in ? Sk PCC Short-circuit power at PCC in kVA ?k PCC Network impedance angle at PCC in ?  Eq. (1) represents an approximation that takes into account only the longitudinal component of the complex voltage drop.

Additional equations are given in the TR for the relative voltage change d of two- and single-phase loads. For two- phase loads the equations are given for both sides (LV, MV) of a MV/LV-transformer taking into account different vector groups. The determination of the load change in eq. (1) is dis- cussed in detail for motor startup and different types of weld- ing machines.

If the repeat rate of the voltage changes exceeds 0.1 per minute, in addition to the voltage change the short-term and long-term flicker has to be calculated and assessed. The TR give an overview of different methods for flicker estimation including simulation and analytical method.

B.  Assessment The assessment is initially carried out for one de-  vice/installation of a network user. Taking the rated apparent power Sr of the considered load, in a first step the ratio  k PCC r  S S  (2)  is calculated and compared with values based on experi- ences. These recommended values are presented in a table that distinguishes between various categories and subcategories of devices (electric heating appliances, lighting systems, motors).

For each category recommended values are given for 3-phase- and 1-phase-connection. I.e. for lighting systems the values vary between 100 and 1000. If the ratio according to eq. (2) is higher than the recommended value, normally no flicker prob- lems will occur at the PCC.

If the ratio according to eq. (2) is smaller than the recom- mended values a further assessment is necessary. Based on the load characteristic (power change, repeat rate) different emis- sion limits apply (cf. fig. 2). The limits for long- and short- term flicker are derived from the appropriate compatibility levels by considering two extreme cases and averaging the re- sults.

If more than one device will be connected or a flicker level already exist at the PCC a detailed assessment has to be car- ried out taking into account all disturbing loads by applying the summation law (eq. (3)).

? = 2 Non-synchronous running wind turbine generator systems.

? = 1 High coincidence probability.

The cumulative value for the short-term flicker must not exceed the compatibility level Pst = 1.

If the limits are exceeded, corrective measures have to be applied (i.e. dynamic compensation, active filter).



IV.  HARMONICS  A.  Basics In contrast to flicker and voltage changes (cp. III) for har-  monics the assessment is always based on the complete instal- lation of the network user SA. Individual devices or installations are not considered. Using this approach the emis- sion is limited for the network user as a whole. If not all indi- vidual loads of a customer emit harmonics the emissions of the relevant loads could be higher or the connection can be approved even in the case of a smaller short-circuit power.

The calculation of emission limits is based on the common equation for sharing harmonic emissions between network us- ers. Making several assumptions and simplifications results in the following easy-to-apply equation:  k PCC A A  SI p I 1000 S  ? ?? ?  (4)  where p? is a proportionality factor. The values for p? are based on the compatibility levels for harmonics taking into ac-  count the sharing of harmonic voltages to all network levels.

Tab. 2 gives recommended values of p? for selected harmon- ics.

Assessment Based on short-circuit power and connected power of the  network user a simplified assessment compares the ratio  k PCC A  S S  (5)  with recommended values for LV- and MV-networks (fig. 3).

In the case of a ratio smaller than the recommended value a more detailed consideration of the network users loads is nec- essary. Based on its THDi each load is assigned to a "har- monic" group (tab. 3).

The TR gives detailed information about absorption circuits and active filter- ing.

Two further chapters are dealing with measurement issues and possible problems with resonances. Especially the detun- ing for reactive power compensation equipment is discussed.

C.  Example An aerial cableway (controlled line-commutated 6-pulse  converter) with a rated power of Sr=500kVA is connected to a MV-network by a transformer. The short-circuit power on the MV-side of the transformer (PCC) is Sk PCC = 60MVA. The power ratio Sk PCC/Sr = 120 is smaller than the recommended value for MV (300) and a more detailed assessment is neces- sary. The harmonic load ratio SOS/SA = 1, because the con- verter is the only load of the network user. The acceptable harmonic load ratio according to fig. 3 is (SOS/SA)acc = 0,63.

The connection cannot be approved without corrective meas- ures. These must ensure, that emission limits calculated ac- cording to eq. (4) are not exceeded (e.g. I5 = 119A).



V.  COMMUTATION NOTCHES  A.  Basics The operation of controlled line-commutated converters  causes periodical occurring dips in the supply voltage. Among other things the depth of this so called commutation notches depends on the trigger delay angle and reaches a maximum on ? = 90?. In case of the stimulation of a resonance (e.g. net- work reactance and capacitance of supply cable) commutation oscillations may occur (cf. fig. 4b)  In the frequency range commutation notches contain a wide frequency band up to several 10 kHz. Consequently only a small part of the commutation notches is considered by the compatibility levels for harmonic voltages. For the assessment of commutation notches, the consideration in the time range is much more suitable.

B.  Assessment The relative depth of the commutation notches dCom  ComCom  U d  U? ?  =  (8)  at the PCC (cf. fig. 4) under the worst-case operating condi- tions should not exceed the following values:  LV-networks:  dCom = 0.10 MV-networks:  dCom = 0.05 In general it is sufficient to assess each converter by itself,  since the superposing of commutation notches is very unlikely. However if several converters are intentionally oper- ated synchronous, the cumulative effect has to be considered and must not exceed the respective emission limit. Commuta- tion oscillations can be neglected, as long as their amplitude does not exceed the emission limit.

To maintain the emission limits, in most cases a suitable commutation reactor is connected upstream of the converter.

The required relative short-circuit voltage uk Com of the com- mutation reactance XCom depends on the ratio of the converter rated power Sr to short-circuit power at the PCC Sk PCC (cf.

fig. 5). The reading for uk Com can be applied directly to 6- pulse converters, while for 12-pulse converters the value is to be halved.

For the purpose of minimizing the network disturbance the value uk Com should be at least 0.04. A ratio Sr / Sk PCC greater than about 0.015 results in a relatively high value for uk Com.

That may cause long durations of the commutation and a higher voltage drop, which can impair the converter operation significantly.

C.  Example For the aerial cableway described in cp. III.C commutation  notches has to be assessed due to the application of a con- trolled line-commutated converter. The ratio Sr/Sk PCC = 0.008.

According to fig. 5 (MV) uk Com = 0.13 is necessary. However the commutation reactor can be smaller due to the positive ef- fect of the compensation equipment necessary for harmonics.

Therefore an assessment of network disturbances is necessary for this type of generating units.

If generating units would cause emissions of the same level than the loads, an adequate voltage quality could not be guar- anteed. Therefore the emission limits for generating units are usually more strictly than for loads. E.g. for harmonics only the half of the values given by tab. 2 are allowed.

In addition to flicker, harmonics, commutation notches and unbalance for generating units has to be assessed the voltage rise and the switching-related voltage change. For the assess- ment it is important to take into account the totality of all gen- erating units in a considered network. The voltage rise at each PCC in a network caused by the totality of all generating units in this network must not exceed  LV-networks:   ?uAn,zul= 3 % MV-networks:  ?uAn,zul= 2 % Detailed examples on 20 pages explain the application of  the assessment procedures by different scenarios.



VII.  CONCLUSIONS The second edition of the TR has 183 pages. It is published  by the appropriate associations of the four countries in five languages (English, German, French, Italian and Czech). The TR is widely used by the distribution network operators in D, A, CH, CZ. In Austria the assessment procedures of the TR are part of the "Technical and Organizational Rules for opera- tors and users of networks" (TOR) published by the Austrian regulatory authority e-control.

Since January 2008 calculation software is available for the assessment of network disturbances in compliance with the TR. The software is based on the power system analysis soft- ware NEPLAN.

Actually the work on the third edition has begun. It is mainly focused on the extension of the assessment to high voltage networks. In this context the newly published Techni- cal Reports IEC 61000-3-6, -7 and -13 dealing with distur- bance assessment in MV-, HV- and EHV-networks will be helpful and are a reliable basis to ensure consistent procedures for the assessment of network disturbances in HV-networks.
