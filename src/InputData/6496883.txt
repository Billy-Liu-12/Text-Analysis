Performance Evaluation of Large Aperture "Polished  Panel" Optical Receivers Based on Experimental Data

Abstract-Recent interest in the development of hybrid  RF/Optical communications has led to the installation of a  "polished-panel" optical receiver evaluation assembly on the  34-meter research antenna at Deep-Space Station 13 (DSS-13) at NASA's Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex  l .

The test setup consists of a custom aluminum panel polished to  optical smoothness, and a large-sensor CCD camera designed  to image the point-spread function (PSF) generated by the polished aluminum panel. Extensive data has been obtained via  real-time tracking and imaging of planets and stars at DSS-13.

Both "on-source" and "off-source" data were recorded at  various elevations, enabling the development of realistic  simulations and analytic models to help determine the  performance of future deep-space communications systems  operating with on-off keying (OOK) or pulse-position? modulated (PPM) signaling formats, and compared with the ultimate quantum bound on detection performance.

Experimentally determined PSFs were scaled to provide  realistic signal-distributions across a photon-counting detector  array when a pulse is received, and uncoded as well as block?  coded performance analyzed and evaluated for a well-known  class of block codes.
