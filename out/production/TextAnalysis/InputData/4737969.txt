I.  INTRODUCTION    Today, satisfying customer needs has become a great concern of almost every company [1]. Among the whole spectrum of customer needs, functional and affective needs have been recognized to be of primary importance [2]. Traditional product design has focused on functional aspect of user needs, making products easy to understand, easy to handle and so forth [3]. However, affective needs, which emphasize on customers? emotional responses and aspirations, are arousing more and more attention in com- parison to the functional needs [2, 4]. In this context, emotional performance may be considered as an extra quality enhancing the value of physical products and em- powering the company a competitive edge.

The challenge of affective product design is to cap- ture customers? affective needs, to define the relationship between the needs and product elements, and to explore the affective properties that products intend to communi- cate through their physical attributes.

Jiao et al. [5] proposed the general process of affec- tive design (Fig.1). Two domains, customer domain and designer domain, are the primary actors. Each has their own interest and distinctive research issues are implied.

Considering customer domain, for example, how to meas- ure customers? affective responses and how to provide them with products which satisfy their emotions? On the other hand, for the designers, how to facilitate the han- dling of affective needs information and assist them to design better products?

This paper adopts a three-step approach to identify the affective dimensions of product design. After that, it applies association rule mining to discover the mapping  between customer affect and perceptual design elements.

The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents the review of previous research. Section 3 de- fines the problem context of affective product design.

Methodology of this study is described in section 4. In section 5, a case study of Volvo truck cabs design is re- ported based on the proposed method. Conclusion is drawn in section 6.

II.  BACKGROUND REVIEW  Eliciting and measuring customer affect is known to be problematic. This is because affect is classified as ?pleasure of the mind? and not accompanied by distinc- tive facial expressions [6]. Due to this reason, physiologi- cal measures which are widely used in Human Factors are not appropriate. Instead, subjective measures are adopted by most of the researchers.      Osgood, Suci, & Tannenbaum [7] proposed semantic differential technique to analyze semantic structures and the affective meaning of things. Semantic differential technique has been successfully applied to find the semantic structure of designs, including the design of doors [8] , telephones[9], office chair [10] and so forth.  The semantic environ- ment description (SMB) was developed by Kuller [11]  to evaluate the impression of an architectural environment.

He validated 36 adjectives and grouped them into 7 fac- tors. Karlsson, Aronsson & Svensson [12] applied Kul- ler?s method for evaluation of car interior design. The results succeeded in discriminating among four passenger cars: BMW 318 (More complex and potent), Volvo S80 (More original and Higher social status), Audi A6 (Less enclosed) and VW Bora (Greater affect).

X. Yang1, D. Wu2, F. Zhou1, J. (Roger) Jiao1 1School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore  2School of Management, Tianjin University, China (yangxi@pmail.ntu.edu.sg; {PG23733595, zhou0099, mjiao}@ntu.edu.sg)          Upon understanding customer affect dimensions, mapping relations from customer affect to design ele- ments can be extracted by qualitative and quantitative methods. Qualitative methods are simple. For example, focus group can be recruited to discuss the relationship.

The reliability of their results, however, is usually upon further judgment of domain experts.  Therefore, some researchers employed statistical methods of multivariate analysis, including multiple linear regression analysis [13], general linear model [14] and so on. These methods provide useful results but it has some theoretical limita- tion, for customer affect do not always have linear charac- teristics. To overcome this limitation, non-linear methods were proposed, including the quantification theory type I, II, III, and IV [15], genetic algorithm [16], neural net- works [17] and others.



III.  PROBLEM FORMULATION   As shown in Fig.1, affective needs are usually ex-  pressed by a set of affective descriptors D = {di| i=1,?,n}. Due to the diversity of customers, it is impera- tive to conduct stratified sampling based on different market segments. Assuming there are several markets, S = {si| i=1,?,I}, and each contains relatively homogenous customers, for customers in the ith market segment, their affective needs can be described as a subset  .

Meanwhile various perceptual product design elements are extracted from the designers. They can be character- ized by another set E = {ei| i=1,?, m}. Each design ele- ment (factor) might have several levels. For example, the interior color (factor) of a truck cab can have three levels (blue, red, and grey). A possible combination of design elements with appropriate levels can be configured into a desired product.



III.  METHODOLOGY   A.  Elicitation and Measurement of Customer Affect  Helander & Tay [6] explored the possibility to use the same set of affective descriptors across different products and concluded that there were no universal affective di- mensions for product design. Hence in this study, we fol- low a three stop approach to elicit driver affect of truck cab. The first step is to collect a large amount of affective descriptors that are representatives of consumer?s feelings on a product. The list of descriptors can be generated from user interviews, related journals and magazines, and words used by marketing and design personnel  In the second step, the most relevant and appropriate words are selected. The number of selected words varies from sev- eral dozens to several hundred. The selected words result- ing from second step are clustered to identify the affective dimensions.

B. Association Rule Mining  Association rule mining  is a well established data mining technique introduced  by Agrawal & Srikant [18].

The basic goal is to find interesting relations between variables in large database. Two thresholds are required to measure an association rule?support and confidence.

Support represents the frequency that items occur or co- occur in a transition record. Confidence represents the degree to describe how strong an item subset X implies another item subset Y. For the two domains in affective design, a general association rule can be formulated as follows:  & & & & & &i j k i j kd d d e e e?             (1)  where , , ,1i j kd d d D i j k n? ? < < ? , and  , , ,1i j ke e e E i j k n? ? < < ?  based on the support and confidence thresholds:  ( & & & & & & )  ( ) i j k i j kCount d d d e e es  Count DB  ? =  (2)   ( & & & & & & )  ( & & & )  ( & & & & & & )  ( & & & )  i j k i j k  i j k  i j k i j k  i j k  S d d d e e e c  S d d d  Count d d d e e e  Count d d d  ? =  ? =  (3)   C. Rule Refinement   One challenge of association rule mining is the thre- shold decision. Low level of support and confidence leads to overwhelming amount of rules.  On the contrary, high thresholds may filter out useful rules. It is necessary to set the criterion for goodness evaluation.  Jiao, Zhang, & He- lander [19] proposed that a customer?s affective satisfac- tion can be interpreted as the customer?s expected utility embodied in a combination of affective descriptors, while his perceived utility is achieved via different configura- tion of design elements. Therefore, a goodness criterion is introduced as the difference between the expected and achieved utilities, shown in (4). The expected affective utility is represented as   and observed affective utility as . For each association rule, if the observed utilities are greater than the expected utilities, it is consi- dered as good rule and retained. Otherwise it is regarded as poor rule and discarded.

?U =                          (4)  where   ? u ? ?          (5) ? u ? ?       (6) stands for the vector of affective descriptors in the left  side of the rule i, and  the vector of design elements in the right side of the rule i.  To compare the utility from two different areas, (7) is introduced to normalize the ex- pected and achieved utilities from (5) and (6).

Conjoint Analysis   Conjoint analysis is a well-established tool in market- ing research for translating customer needs and expecta- tion into product design elements [20]. It is based on a decompositional approach, in which subjects react to a set of total profile descriptions. It is the job of the analysis to find a set of part-worth utility for the individual attributes which are most consistent with the respondent?s overall preferences, given some type of composition rule [21]. In this study, conjoint analysis is used to calculate customer expected utility  and achieved utility .



V.  CASE STUDY  A. Elicitation of Affective Needs and Design Elements   A total number of 203 affective descriptors were col- lected from truck magazines and truck company websites.

They were subject to industrial experts? examination.

Among them, 61 adjectives were selected as the most relevant to truck cab design. 36 students from Nanyang Technological University were recruited to evaluate a range of truck cabs against each adjective. 7-point Likert scale was used ranging from 1(absolute not) to 3(not real- ly) to 5(much) to 7(very much). Six Volvo truck cab pic- tures were shown to each subject. In total, 216 evaluations was collected, resulting in a 216 61 matrix. Clustering analysis was used to identify the affective dimensions of truck cab design.  Ten clusters were retained to form the affective dimensions as shown in Table I. Meanwhile, the major design elements are identified by senior design en- gineers. A total of 18 design elements are recognized as shown in Table II.

Description of Transition Data  The transaction database is part of the CATER project. Fifteen experienced truck drivers from Shanghai were interviewed to investigate their affective require- ments of truck cab. The same 6 truck cab pictures were presented to the truck drivers. They were asked to eva- luate each truck cab against the 10 affective dimensions.

A sample response could be (d9, d7, e1, e3, e5, e8, e10, e13, e14), which means the truck cab is characterized as foldable bunk,  above bed storage, fabric seat material, embedded reading light, textile mats, and yellow interior colour. The interviewee feels this configuration functional and comfortable.  There were two missing data and thus 88 interview records were used.

C. Association Rule Mining  The 88 interview records were organized into transac- tional database. A data mining tool, Magnum Opus (Ver- sion 2.0), was employed to find the mapping relationships between affective needs and design elements. The setting of the searching criteria is shown in Fig.3. The mining process terminated with a set of rules containing 50 asso- ciation rules, as shown in Table III.

Conjoint Analysis  Conjoint analysis was applied for evaluating the part- worth utility of the design elements. Given all design elements as shown in Table II, a total number of 2 23 2 2 2 5 480 possible product configura- tions. To overcome such an explosion of configurations by enumeration, orthogonal product profiles are generated based on the principle of Design of Optimal Experiment (DOE) [22]. Using Taguchi orthogonal array selector pro- vided by SPSS software (www.spss.com), a total number of 27 orthogonal product profiles are generated. A sepa- rate group of 36 truck drivers was invited to act as the respondents for conjoint analysis. Each respondent was asked to evaluate all 27 profiles one by one and give the rank for all the profiles. This results in 36 27 groups of data. For each respondent, 27 regression equations are obtained by interpreting his original choice data as a bi- nary instance of each part-worth utility. With these 27 equations, the part-worth utilities for this respondent are derived. Averaging the part-worth utility results in a seg- ment-level utility for each design element. Table IV shows the part-worth utilities of each level of every de- sign element. Simiarly, part-worth utilities of every affec- tive descriptor were obtained as shown in Table V.

Rule Refinement  The proposed goodness evaluation criterion was used to refine the 50 rules in Table III. For each rule, difference between achieved utility and expected utility was calcu- lated, indicated as UO-UE, in Table VI. An association rule is retained when UO-UE >= 0 and eliminated otherwise.

In total, 19 rules were evaluated as good rules and formed the refined set of association rules.

VI.  CONCLUSION   Affective product design implies a gradual shift of  design focus from functional aspect to affective/emotional aspect.  It evolves as an interdisciplinary research topic between human factors, industrial design and many other disciplines. In this paper, generic affective dimensions of truck cab design were structured. Association rule mining was used in this paper to reveal the mapping from cus- tomer affect to perceptual design elements.  To refine association rules, a goodness criterion was introduced as the difference between customers expected utility and observed utility. A case study of Volvo truck cab design is presented based on the proposed methods.
