Abstract?Science data is the sole or principal product of spaceflight missions funded by the NASA Science Mission Directorate. However, post-launch resource and technical constraints largely external to the project may limit continuous achievement of the expected science data downlink volume. This paper provides two examples of how flight projects may exploit the flexibility of the end-to- end mission data system to compensate for fluctuations in downlink supply and demand.

The major downlink resource constraint is the finite supply of, and the very high demand for, the available Deep Space Network (DSN) assets after subtracting scheduled and unscheduled DSN downtime. Given their minimal ability to mitigate DSN resource limitations, flight projects must consider mission operations improvements that may help to achieve Level 1 (i.e., mission success) requirements.
