Abstract?Detection water and aqueous land hazards in  outdoor navigation is a big challenge in unknown outdoor environment. Advantages of laser scanning are encouraging, firstly due to its distinguished detection capacity at night and less quantity of data. It was found by experiments that there was no evident changing trend of laser remission with the increase of color density in water, no matter green, red, or dark blue. These colored water shared common feature of weak mirror-deflection with pure water. However, remission of black water surface dropped linearly approximately with the increase of color density, and strong mirror-deflection was observed. Experiments also indicated that water turbidity had great effect on both remission and mirror-deflection, and there was significant positive correlation between laser remission and the soil moisture content.

These phenomena could be explained with twice reflected pulse property of laser range finder and optical property of water-air interface in laser scanning. Based on the experiment results, methods to distinguish pure or turbid water surface from land and to distinguish hazard aqueous land from safe dry land in natural scene were put forward.



I. INTRODUCTION In unmanned ground vehicle autonomous outdoor navigation,  it?s essential to identify road surface conditions, in particular detection of water and mud hazard. Water hazard detection is a significantly challenging capability for navigation [1~7].

Several studies tried to perform the water surface detection with vision system employing color image segmentation processing [2~4, 8, 9], but it may be particularly difficult attributed to the water reflection of other aspects of the terrain [5].The big challenge here is that it may be particularly difficult to formulate a single feature capable of characterizing water when it reflects other aspects of the terrain, such as trees, hills, or buildings [5]. Little trial to detect water surface with short-wave infrared or thermal infrared imagery was unsatisfied, too, due to the weak capability to deal with adjacent aspect reflection, complicated operation and interference of surroundings uncertainty [5]. Meanwhile, detection of hazard aqueous land is an essential but more difficult task for vehicle autonomous navigation, and few efficient achievements can be found on this study [7].

Laser scanning technology is widely used in autonomous vehicle navigation attributed to its most valuable advantages.

First of all, it is insensitive to light conditions and can be used even in night.

much smaller data size, including the distance, orientation and reflection of object in large wide-range scene. However, less study has been conducted on water surface detection with laser scanning in navigation.

In this paper, main properties of laser range scanning of water and mud surface in different conditions were studied by experiments, and water and mud surface detection in out-door environment based on laser scanning was put forward.



II. EXPERIMENT MATERIALS AND METHODS  A. Materials The experiments were conducted in August, 2013 at the  Laboratory for Robotics & Automation, Michigan State University. As shown in Fig.1, all laser scanning experiments were performed by means of a Sick LMS111 laser ranger finder (wavelength of laser diode: 905nm; resolution of the angular step width: 0.50?) [10]. Water and soil were filled in a ladder-shaped plastic container (top size: 365 265mm; bottom size: 345 245mm; depth: 67mm), respectively. A white board was applied as the object adjacent to the water surface.

Fig. 1.  Reflectance tests of laser scanning  B. Methods 1) Water color: 2D laser range scanning to water surface of  four different colors (black, red, green and dark blue) was tested. These four colors represented different water scene in nature. To every color, the plastic container was firstly filled with pure water, and the color ink was added into the water gradually from 0 to 800 ?l with a micropipettor (liquid relief: 50?l) and mixed well (Fig. 2). The laser range finder was then rotated to incident to water surface at angle of 75.5?. 2D laser range scanning was performed on surface of different colored water of different density.

And then soil was added into the water at step of 100g gradually from 0 to 600g and mixed well. As a result, different  turbidity from 0 to ? of water was obtained (Fig. 3). The laser range finder was rotated to incident to water surface at angle of 75.5?.

2D laser scanning was performed to water surface of different turbidity one by one.

Firstly, dry soil was filled into the plastic container and compacted, and 2D laser range scanning was performed. Then pure water was added into the soil gradually to construct different state of land with different moisture content: firm half-wet, wet, half oozy, oozy, muddy and waterlogged (Fig.4). The laser range finder was rotated to incident to water surface at angle of 75.5?. 2D laser scanning was performed to different land state one by one.

4) White board mirror-deflection: Water with added 800 ?l  green ink, 800 ?l dark blue ink and 525?l red ink was selected, respectively. A white board was put on the opposite side of the water vertically, which was moved step by step to leave the water surface (Fig. 1).  2D laser range scanning was performed to the water surface at different distance.

III. TEST RESULTS  A. Water color The angle range of water surface in laser scanning  experiments was decided by both the size of the container and relative position between the laser range finder and it (Fig. 5).

Deleting some points at boundary, the effective point cloud data were in angle range from 78.5? to 93.5?.

Fig. 5.  Angle range of water surface in laser scanning  Color density was calculated as follow: /                                        (1)  ?  Laser  Water Area       where ? is color density of the water (?l/L); Vc is the volume of color ink added into the water(?l); Vw is  the volume of the water in the container (L), which is known as volume of the plastic container.

In laser scanning, it was found that the remission of red, green and dark blue water was similar with pure water, and no evident changing trend was found with the increase of color density (Fig. 6). The average remission rate was about 25% for water surface of any color.

Fig. 6.  Laser remission of different color water  B. White board mirror-deflection Experiments indicated that weak mirror-deflection was a  universal phenomenon to either pure water or water with different color, which was the capacity of water surface to detect objects in very limited distance. Take white board as   Fig. 7.  Distance as a function of laser remission by white board  adjacent object, when its distance from water surface was less than about 0.5m, the weak mirror-deflection scanning happened. It was interesting that, remission rose obviously when the white board left the water surface in effective distance (Fig. 7), while the weak mirror-deflection phenomenon disappeared suddenly when it was more than 0.5m far away from water surface.

C. Color density of water In experiments, strong mirror-deflection phenomenon was observed only from laser scanning of black water. Although no evident changing trend of laser remission was found with the increase of color density, remission of black water surface dropped linearly approximately with the increase of color density (Fig. 8, Fig. 9). When color density increased to 15.5 ?l/L, the remission dropped to near 10% and strong mirror-deflection scanning appeared. Objects several meters far away from the water could be detected.

Water turbidity Strong mirror-deflection might happen when water was  some turbid (Fig. 10). It was found that part of turbid water surface might deflect the laser beam to detect objects in the distance. To describe the relation between the degree of strong mirror-deflection and water turbidity, rate of strong mirror-deflection was defined as the percentage of point number of objects deflected in all point number in scanning range from 78.5? to 93.5?.

Experiments indicated that water turbidity had great effect on both remission and mirror-deflection (Fig. 11). When water was clearer, laser remission was higher similar to pure water and no strong mirror-deflection happened. While when water  23.0 23.5 24.0 24.5 25.0 25.5 26.0 26.5 27.0  0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140  R em  is si  on (%  )  Density(?l/L)green red dark blue        1250 1350 1450 1550 1650  R em  is si  on (%  )  Distance(mm) pure dark blue red green   78.5 81 83.5 86 88.5 91 93.5  R em  is si  on ra  te (%  )  Scan angle(?)   0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16  R em  is si  on (%  )  Density(?l/L)  Pure water   4.3  8.6 10.3 12.1 13.8       became more turbid, remission dropped rapidly and strong mirror-deflection appeared. However, when water was turbid enough similar to mud, remission increased and strong mirror-deflection disappeared again.

Fig. 10.  Strong mirror-deflection scanning   Fig. 11.  Laser remission & strong mirror rate as a function of turbidity  E. State of land Tests indicated that there was significant positive correlation  between laser remission and soil moisture content (Fig. 12).

Dangerous oozy, muddy or even waterlogged land, whose remission were all lower than 45%, were easily to be distinguished from hard dry land with a remission higher than   Fig. 12.  Remission of laser scanning by land surface of different state  57%?Average laser remission of the waterlogged land surface was only 31.2%.



IV. DISCUSSION  A. Reflection-mirror performance of water surface to laser scanning  1) Property of laser scanning: The Laser range finder is an electro-optical laser measurement system that electro-sensitively scans the perimeter of its surroundings with the aid of laser beams. The laser range finder emits pulsed laser beams using a laser diode. If a pulsed laser beam emitted from the laser range finder is incident on some object, the reflection from its surface is detected in the laser measurement system, and then the distance to the object is calculated from the propagation time the light requires from emission to reception of the reflection at the sensor.

The reflection of the laser beam varies as a function of the surface structure and color. At mirror surfaces the laser beam is almost entirely deflected. Instead of the surface of the mirror, it is possible that the object on which the deflected laser beam is incident may be detected. An application can, then, take into account the 2nd reflected pulse for the measurement and ignore the first reflected pulse.

2) Laser range scanning of water surface: Water is a special material, and three optical phenomena will happen when a beam of light is incident on flat water surface:  reflection, deflection and refraction (Fig. 13). So when a laser beam bi is incident on flat water surface, three reflection beam might be accepted by the sensor (Fig. 14).

Fig. 13.  Optical properties of water surface The first br is direct reflection of water surface, which may  bring information of real distance dw and remission rw of water surface. The second bm is deflected by water surface due to mirror effect, which might then be incident on adjacent object and reflected back to the sensor (bmr). As the result of mirror effect, the laser beam bmr brings information of remission of the object ro and virtual distance of the object dmr, which is as follow: /2 where dm is the distance from water surface to the object(mm), do is the real distance from the object to the laser range finder.

The third bb is refracted by surface water, which may then be incident on the water bottom and partly reflected back to the sensor due to the deflection once more by water surface in water. So the laser beam bb brings information of partly remission of bottom and refracted distance of bottom.

Optical phenomenon of water surface in laser scanning 1) Why water bottom could not be detected: It was found in  experiments that the direct reflection or mirror-deflection data by any water surface would be got by laser range finder, while no water bottom reflection was found. It might be mainly related to the angle of incidence. It was known that some of the laser energy penetrated the interface and could even produce a range measurement to the bottom of the water body, depending on angle of incidence, laser wavelength, and attenuation in the water column [11].  The transmitted power for horizontal polarizations was given as [11]: 2sin where ?i and ?t are the incident and transmitted angles, na and nw are the indices of refraction on each side of the interface(1.0 and 1.33 for air and fresh water).

In our experiment study, the ?i and ?t were so smaller that the water bottom reflection received by the laser range finder was much smaller, compared with part of the direct reflection and mirror-deflection. The Sick laser range finder could receive and analyze the first and second reflected pulse, and it was default to measure and record one of the larger reflection rate. The reflection rate of water bottom was so weak that it was smaller than both part of the direct reflection and mirror-deflection, or even smaller than the threshold value of laser receiver, so only reflection and mirror-deflection could be detected in laser scanning of water surface for our experiments.

In practical application, larger incident angle was necessary to ensure a safe response distance to autonomous vehicle from hazardous water or mud. So water bottom reflection was negligible in outdoor navigation.

2) Which was detected, water or adjacent object: It indicated that either water surface or adjacent objects would be detected by laser scanning. It were both the twice reflected pulse property of Sick laser range finder and intensity difference of different laser beam, due to the optical property of water-air interface, to decide which of them would be detected. When laser beam was incident on water surface at a large angle, only very little energy would be reflect back to the sensor directly by diffuse reflecting. However, enough energy might be deflected due to the mirror mechanism. So when the deflected laser beam was incident to adjacent object at relative small angle, the 2nd reflected laser beam by adjacent object might have higher energy than the 1st directed reflected laser beam by water  surface. It could explain why all water has mirror-deflection capacity. When energy of deflected laser beam was larger enough, it led to a higher remission of 2nd reflected laser beam by distant object than the 1st directed reflected laser beam. As a result, strong mirror-deflection appeared.

C. Remission and mirror-deflection phenomenon of water surface  1) Effect of color on remission and mirror-deflection: It was found that black color had important effect on the remission rate and reflection-mirror properties, while green, red and dark blue had almost no effect. When water was less clear or much darker, both part of direct reflection and refraction decreased, so the part of mirror-deflection was strengthen. If intensity of deflected laser beam received by the laser range finder exceeded the threshold value and higher than direct reflection, the laser range finder would record the mirror-deflection for the measurement and ignore the direct reflected pulse.

It might be attributed to the much lower light reflection of black color. It is well known that black color can absorb large part of light energy, especially of near infrared laser beam.  The higher is color density of black water, the lower is its remission.

The mirror-deflection effect was strengthened with the drop of remission rate of water surface, so strong mirror-deflection appeared when color density reached only 15.5 ?l/L.

2) Effect of turbidity on remission and mirror-deflection: Turbidity of water had important effect on the remission rate and mirror-deflection of water surface. When the water was clear enough, the remission was similar with that of pure water, and weak mirror-deflection was observed. When water turned more turbid, the remission rate of water surface dropped obviously, meanwhile strong mirror-deflection appeared. The coexisting strong mirror-deflection and none strong mirror-deflection may be relative with the uniformity of turbid water and suspended matter inside water.

When the water was turbid enough, it might be similar as mud, then the mirror-deflection capacity of water surface disappeared and the laser beam could not penetrate water. As a result, the remission of water surface would rise again and mirror effect would disappear.



V. ROAD SURFACE CONDITIONS IDENTIFICATION IN NATURAL SCENE  A. Distinguishing water surface from land To detect water hazards in outdoor navigation is a big  challenge, since there are so many environmental variables should to be taken into consideration. To find a detection method that can be reliable in any case is reachless until now, but it is undoubtedly necessary to find detection method that has better adaptability. Advantages of laser scanning are encouraging based on experiment results. First of all, vision system is impossible to perform night navigation, but laser scanning can work as usual even in zero light conditions.

1) Pure water surface detection: In practical outdoor navigation, hazard water body that the autonomous vehicle might meet was river, lake or small pond. Some natural water  bi  Object  bm br  bmr  Water surface  Laser  bb  Bottom  ?i       bodies may be smaller enough, but width of most water bodies may exceed the detection scope of mirror-deflection scanning.

If water body is pure enough, only weak mirror-deflection is possible, so only objects no farer than 1.5m can be detected by mirror-deflection of water surface.  It means most part of water surface will be detected as real distance and real remission value, which is much lower than safe dry land in same distance.

So in 3D laser scanning, there will be clear boundary between water and land surface.

2)  Turbid water surface detection: If water body is some turbid as most natural water would be, strong mirror-deflection effect will appear.  As a result, some part of water surface in open terrain will be detected as real distance and real remission value (Fig. 15), other part under a shadow from adjacent land object in measurement scope of laser range finder will be detected twice, one is real distance Dr and profile of the object by direct scanning, second is virtual distance Dv and profile of the object by mirror-deflection scanning at water surface.

Based on the ?time of flight? measurement principle of laser range finder, virtual distance Dv may be expressed roughly as follow:   ? ?/2                       (2)  It means two laser images are acquired by laser scanning, which has same shape of profile while in different distance. By detecting two images in 3D scanning of same object, the part of water surface can be identified.

Fig. 15.  Turbid water surface detection  B. Distinguishing hazard aqueous land from safe dry land In various land surfaces with different water content, dry  land is absolutely safe to autonomous vehicle, while half-oozy, oozy, muddy and waterlogged land may bring hazard to it. In laser scanning, remission rate of the above hazardous land is much lower than dry land, it is easy to judge and make decision for autonomous vehicle.

To firm half-wet and firm-wet land, their firmness cannot assure a safe passing for autonomous vehicle, meanwhile their remission falls in between safe and hazardous land. So in navigation, it might be better to detect the half-wet and firm-wet land conditions and to send a warning signal to  autonomous vehicle, which may help it to make more cautious decision.

C. Water-land boundary construction In navigation, 3D laser scanning is applied by rotating or  moving laser range finder to obtain both range image and remission image of the scene simultaneously constructed with 3D point cloud. With the above method, the edited remission image may give boundary among water surface, aqueous land surface and safe dry land surface. Combining the remission image with range image, the vehicle may know clearly where is water hazard and plan the optimal route to pass according to the boundary.



VI. CONCLUSION This paper investigated optical phenomenon of water and  aqueous land surface in laser scanning in different conditions by experiments. It was found that pure water or colored water, no matter green, red, dark blue or light black shared common feature of weak mirror-deflection, while dark black water or turbid water had special capacity of strong mirror-deflection.

These phenomena could be explained with twice reflected pulse property of laser range finder and optical property of water-air interface in laser scanning. Based on the experiment results, identification methods for water and aqueous land surface in natural scene were put forward. Further work will be devoted to verify effectiveness of the method in outdoor environment.
