With advantages of covering rate and multi-goals exploring capability, the Space Based technology had been applied to many fields such as LEO satellite determination based on GPS, midcourse ballistic missile tracking and so on, the main challenge for space based observation is errors of platform which can badly contaminate the observation data. In space, the SBV platform will be shaken with high frequency error and the axes will be circumvolved with low frequency, so the observation data contains not only stochastic errors data but also system errors data with different frequency. How to describe the system error and improve the orbit determination of spacecraft based on space based observation data is the goal of this paper.

Combine orbit determination method is to deal with the SBV satellite orbit and space object satellite orbit synchronously, so the system error of SBV will be restrained. Batch orbit determination method and combine orbit determination algorithm were involved in the paper.

By generating a new strategy to analyz the residuals of orbit determination, it is designed to produce the near true environment observation error model, and to compensate in calculation. Thus, semi-parametric non linear model was introduced in this paper, which can distinctly describe the LEO satellite observation model and dynamic model based on Space Based Surveillance System, and a nonparametric estimator was proposed to solve the semi-parametric non linear model, finally the Fourier Transform Method for non-parametric parts was applied to decompose the different system signals in orbit to distinguish the dynamic error model and the observation error model or satellite platform error of space based satellite. 1 2  TABLE OF CONTENTS  1.

INTRODUCTION The Space?Based Visible sensor had been launched on the Midcourse Space Experiment satellite for more than ten years, and is still operated in space surveillance because of its superiority on quality of deep-space object catalog maintaining and abundant advantage of cover rate and multi-goals capability compared with ground observation model[1,2]. The SBV had completed its original mission of demonstrating the efficacy of using the SBV for space surveillance, and join in the operational Space-Based Space Surveillance. SBV proved that the space based observation model can improve the capability of searching space objects[3], because the optical camera will not be easily disturbed by atmosphere, the image de-noise process became comparatively easily, on the condition of phase angle of goal and sun line meeting lower than threshold value, the observation data can be obtained. The main error of observation error includes system error caused by platform attitude state error. In space, the satellite attitude will be changed by sun radiation disturbed force , control force, etc., which results in platform circumrotating and wobbling and shaking, and finally results in observation system and stochastic error data. How to restrain pollution by the platform error is the goal of this paper.

The perturbation of satellite in the space cannot be modeled very exactly because of the unknown space environment, especially for the LEO satellite. The atmosphere density model is very difficult to describe. And because the characteristic of objects in the space such as their area and quality is unknown too, the radiation pressure model and atmosphere drag model contain many low precise parameters, so the dynamic model error is not avoid in the orbit determination. Many scholars had been studying effective methods for restraining the dynamic error[4,5]. The main strategy was Reduced-dynamic orbit determination[6,7], which add the process noise to the dynamic model in orbit to absorb the influence of model error. Reduced-dynamic orbit determination method needs       rigorous condition of observation data, or a very precise kinematic orbit of the object, which is not suitable for surveillance of non cooperative object. The intention of this paper is try to create a compensation model of the dynamic model.

2. OBSERVATION MODEL OF SPACE BASED VISIBLE  The space based satellite usually carries two kinds of sensor, one is capturing camera with width field of vision and low precision used to detect objects, and the other is tracking camera with narrow field of vision and high precision used to tracke the objects.

2.1 Capturing Mode of SBV   Three modes can be adapted to the observation model of space based optical camera. i.e. optical barrier and fixed airspace and geosynchronous belts.

1) optical barrier  Because all the satellite will pass through a plane with earth core, it can be surveillanced by SBV, if some SBV launched on one orbit with different true anomaly and form an optical barrier. The sketch map is as follows,     Fig.1 Sketch map of optical barrier mode In this observation mode, every SBV scans ahead the region when the satellite moving ahead. It can be imaged if the objects satisfy the condition of imaging (responding range, background light and platform angles).

2) fixed airspace     Fig.2 Sketch map of fixed airspace mode In this observation mode, the SBV stare at the fixed space through oriented toward one star set by ground station.

When the object passes through the area, a beam line will be shaped in the CCD[see figure 5], so the observation data can be got.

3) geosychronous belts     Fig.3 Sketch map of geosynchronous belts mode Geosynchronous belts mode is designed to supervise the deep space objects, and to catalog the GEO satellite.

2.2 Tracking Mode of SBV  Once the objects were captured by SBV, the tracking program can be carried out automatically with closed loop mode by the tracking optical sensor. In the closed loop mode, the phase angle(see in the figure4) is the vital factor for imaging[8,9], because the photometric condition is the main challenge for SBV. The observed region of space object can be restricted with the following conditions:  1)  Object is not in the shadow of Earth.

2) The background of the object should not be sunlit earth.

3) The phase angle should be smaller than 100 degree.

4) The brightness should reach the value needed of SBV.

In space, the background of the object is correspondingly simply towards to ground base, So the random factor is not dominant, while the calibration process is very difficult, the rather that attitude of SBV is not firmly changeless because of the control of satellite. Thus, the system error will be the dominating parts in the observation data error.

The SBV sate vector in J2000.0 inertial frame  can be described as  ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )( )T, , , , , ,X Y ZR R X t Y t Z t V t V t V t= ?  the object in space should  transmit  to onboard frame of SBV, note as  ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )( )T, , , , , ,b b b b b xb yb zbr r x t y t z t v t v t v t= .

1) No SBV satellite ephemeris error  The state of object satellite is a function of SBV position, if the SBV ephemeris is exact, then the observation data (azimuth and elevation in the onboard frame of SBV)can be described as the following formulas:  ( ) ( ) 2 2  arctan b b b  zt t x y  ?? ? ? ? ? ?= + ? ?+? ?  ?1?  ( ) ( )arctan b b  yt t x ?  ? ? ? ?  = +? ? ? ?  ?2?  Where, ( ) ( ),t t? ?? ?  are stochastic error of measurement model.

2) With SBV satellite ephemeris error  Define the SBV ephemeris error as  ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )( )T, , , , , ,X Y ZR R X t Y t Z t V t V t V t? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?= Object satellite position error in onboard frame of SBV cased by ( ),R R? ?  can be written as ( ),b br r? ? .

Then the observation model should be amended as the following,  ( ) ( ) ( )  ( )  ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )  2 2  2 2  arctan  arctan  b b  b b b b  b  b b  z zt t x x y y  z s t t x y  ? ?  ? ?  ? ?  ? ?  ?  ? ? +? ?= +? ?  ? ?+ + +? ? ? ? ? ?= + +? ? ? ?+? ?    ( ) ( )  ( ) ( )  arctan  arctan  b b  b b  b  b  y yt t x x  y s t t x  ? ?  ?  ? ?  ? ?  ?  ? ?+= +? ?+? ? ? ?  = + +? ? ? ?    Where ( ) ( ),s t s t? ? are the system error caused by SBV satellite ephemeris error.

In fact, for SBV satellite, there is not only ephemeris error but also attitude error, which will cause shake effect of platform and result in system errors in observation data with forms of different frequency error. We note the system error caused by platform error as ( ) ( ),s t s t? ? , too. In the orbit determination calculation, we try to create the observation model of ( ) ( ),s t s t? ? .

The measurement model in onboard frame is simply noted as,  ( ) ( ) ( ), , ,b b b b b cH G x y z t s t t?= + +       ?3? Where ( )cs t is the system error of SBV, ( )t? is the stochastic error of the SBV.

Formula (3) can be transformed to other state in J2000.0 inertial frame, that is,  ( ) ( ) ( ), , ,b cH G x y z t s t t?= + +       3. ORBIT DIFFERENTIAL CORRECTION BASED ON MODEL COMPENSATION  3.1 Space Objects Dynamics Model   The dynamic model in the J2000.0 inertial frame can be described as the following:  3 NB NS TD RL SR AL DG THr r f f f f f f f fr ?=? + + + + + + + + ?4?  Where, NBf is lunisolar perturbation, NSf is geopotential field, TDf is tides force, RLf is relativistic effect, SRf is solar radiation pressure, ALf is infrared radiation pressure of the earth, DGf is the atmospheric drag, and the THf is other force.

And the kinematic model can be noted as,  ( ) ( ) ( )0 0  , ,r F r t F r t  r t r ?= +??  ? =??  ?5?  Where ( )T1 2 6, , , , , , , , ,x y z pr x y z v v v b b b ?= is the satellite state vector? 61, ?pbb are unknown parameters.

Although the dynamic model is more and more exact, there still some perturbation unknown which will arouse position errors within integral process. ( ),F r t? here refers to the dynamic model error.

The orbit function can be deployed as:  ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) *  * *, , , r r  F Fr t F r t F r t r F r t r  ? ?  =  ? +? ?= = + ? +? ??? ? ?6?  Let                             ( ) ( ) ( )trtrtr *?=? ?  ( ) ( ) ( ) *r r  F F A t A t  r ?  ?  =  ? +? ? + = ? ??? ?    Formula?6?can be noted?  ( ) ( ) ( )( ) ( )r t A t A t r t?? = + ?       ?7? Formula (7) can be solved by the differential equations theory, which can be expressed as following:  ( ) ( ) ( )( ) ( )0 0 0, ,r t t t t t r t?? = ? + ? ?  ?8? Where ( )0,t t? is state transferring matrix toward precise parameter perturbation force, and ( )0,t t?? is state transferring matrix toward perturbation force error. In fact,  ( )0  , rt t r  ?? = ?  , so we can get the state transform function,  ( ) ( ) ( )( ) ( )0 0 0, ,r t t t t t r t?= ? + ? ? .

3.2 Orbit Improvement  The observation model can be written as:  ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )( ) ( ) ( )  ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) 0 0  0 0  , ,  , ,  , ,  b b c c  c  d c  H G r t s t t G r t s t t  G r t t s t t  G r t t s t s t t ?  ? ?  ?  ?  = + + = + +  = ?+? + +  = ? + + +  ?9?  where?  ( ) ( )( ) ( )0 0 0 0, , , ,ds t G r t t G r t t?= ? + ? ? ? ? it describes the mixed error transmitted to measurement data by dynamic model error ( ),F r t? ; ( )cs t describes the system error of measurement equipment, although it can be amended, however residual error will still exist, noted as  ( )cs t  all the same. It is obviously that ( )ds t and ( )cs t will be blended together to form new system error ( )s t .

To deploy the observation mode, it can be get as following,  ( ) ( ) ( ) *  0 0  * 0 0   , , r r  GH G r t t r s t t r  ? =  ?= ? + ? + + ?    Let  ( )  * 0 0  * 0 0   , ,  r r  g H G r t t  GB r  =  ? = ? ? ?? ? ?=? ???  ,  The above formula can be simply noted as:  ( ) ( )g B r s t t?= ? ? + +          ?10? Where   * *  0 0 0 0  0 0  b b b  br r r r  G r rGB R B r r r r  = =  ? ? ??= = = ? ? ? ? ? ? ?  ,  bR is differential coefficient matrix of measurement function towards orbit state. 1B is the frame circumrotating matrix of j2000.0 to onboard frame.

So semi-parametric model of orbit determination will be got,  ( ) ( )g B r s t t?= ? ? + +          (11) A semi-parametric model includes not only a parametric component, but also a nonparametric component. So it has the advantages of the parametric model and nonparametric model. On traditional orbit determination strategy, nonparametric component ( )s t  and error component  ( )t? will be regarded as Gauss-Noise, then Least-Square method can be used to solve the orbit error function, and the improvement value of initial orbit state can be written as the follows:       ( ) 1T Tr B W B B h?? =           ?12?  ( )g t is named as Observation and Calculation(OC) residuals. In traditional LSE orbit improvement, the OC residuals contains not only space object dynamic error, observation system error, SBV platform error and SBV satellite ephemeris error. To decompose the OC residual error and distinguish the above errors is a perfect idea, but it is very difficult if the frequencies of the errors are the same. As we know that ephemeris error is difficult to affirm, so we design the combine orbit determination to eliminate it.

4. COMBINE ORBIT DIFFERENTIAL CORRECTION Combine orbit improvement is a parallel process to calculate the space object orbit and the SBV satellite orbit.

It can be concluded from the above discussion that the ephemeris error of SBV satellite will badly influence the precision of orbit determination of space objects, and model compensation improvement is an effective method to restrain the platform error. However, if the characteristic of all the error are the same, it is difficult to distinguish the dynamic error and ephemeris error of SBV. Thus, combine improvement is the best way to eliminate the ephemeris system error first. And then, the other model errors can be easily distinguished through OC residual analysis.

In combine orbit determination mode, suppose that the total number of ground station is m, and the number of space based satellite is n, see figure 6.

Fig.6 Combine orbit determination sketch map  The combine observation model is as the following,  ( ) ( ) ( )*0 0 *  0 0  * 0 0  * * * 0 0 0 0  0 0  , , , , i i  n n  r rri i rn n R R  R R  GH G r R R t t s t t r R  ?= =  =  ?= ? ? ? + ?+ + ? ?  Where ( )T0 01, 0, nr R R? = ? ? ? Let  ( ) *  0 0 *  0 0  * 0 0  * * * 0 0 0 0  0 0  , , , ,  i i  n n  ri i rn n  r r R R  R R  g H G r R R t t  GB r R = =  =  ? = ? ? ? ? ? ? ?? =  ? ?? ? ?  ,  Then the combine orbit determination with the same form can be described as the following:  ( ) ( )g B r s t t?= ? ? + +                  ?13?  Thus, the ( )s t  will just contain dynamic model error and observation error. Because of special frequency of these errors, it is easy to distinguish them.

4.1 Method to Weight on Different Observation Model  So many ground station and space based SBV, the precision of these observation data is different, so how to correctly weight them is important to improve the estimation results.

A traditional method is variance component estimation[10,11].

We will apply this method in combine orbit determination.

But we add the factor to it discussed following .

Take the matrix B into account  ( ) ( )  ( ) ( )  ( ) ( )  ( ) ( ) ( )( )  0 0  1,1 1,2 1, 1  , , , , , ,  , , , ,  , p n  r R B  r R  B B B r R  ? ? ? ? ?  ? ? ? +  ? ? ? ? ? ?? ? ? ? = ? ? ? ? ? ?? ? ? ? ? ?? ? ? ? ?? ? ? ? ? ? ? ??  = ? ?? ??? ?    Where,  ( )T, , , , ,a e i M? ?= ? is the ephemeris of space object;  ( )T, , , , ,i i i i i ia e i M?? = ? is the ephemeris of SBV satellite;  ( )  ( )  1,1  1,2  1,3  1,4  1,5  1,6   ? sin  ?  r r nB t a a a  B H r K r  zB R i  B  B R r  rB n  ? ? ?? ? ? ?= + ? ?? ? ?? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?? ??  ? = +? ? ? ?? =? ? ?  ? ?? ? = ? ? ? = ? ? ? ? ? ? = ? ? ? ? ??

If i? = ? , that is ,the space object and the SBV satellite is  in the same orbit plane, then the matrix B is singular, and the orbit will not be estimated. If  1? ? ? ,the corresponding weight of space based satellite observation data should be depressed.

4.2 Orbit Improvement Based on Model Compensation  We apply semi-parametric estimator to model (13), and then get the model error estimated data ( )s? t . Decompose  ( )s? t  so as to distinguish the dynamic model error and platform error and soon, based on the different frequency of errors. Fourier Transform and wave analysis provide impelling instrument for decomposing these different errors.

The flow map of orbit determination based on model compensation is written as the following,   Fig.7 Flow map of orbit improvement  5. SIMULATION EXPERIMENTS To access the validity of the orbit determination method put forward in this paper, an experiment was designed according to the operating SBV. We suppose that the SBSS consists of two space based satellites and six ground stations.

The combine orbit determination can restrain the SBV ephemeris error, but the LEO dynamic model error cannot yet be estimated. By analyzing the OC residual error, the position error caused by dynamic model error can be estimated, and the dynamic model error or the perturbation force model error can be got by differentialing it. Thus add this force model estimated to the state function again, then the precision of model can be improved. As a result, the       compensation method can restrain the dynamic model error, so the precision of orbit determination for LEO and SBV can get improved together.

6. CONCLUSION The space based observation technology will be predominant in the next generation of space surveillance, although it has been successful through MSX satellite, there still many key technoogies to be solved, such as the system error of space based satellite platform, the dynamic model error of the space object, the real time tracking method, the debris?s auto identifiability and so on. This paper proposed an operational method of solving the above question with combine orbit determination based on compensation method. Combine orbit determination task is a very colossal project requiring very pivotal and basic technology, so, the work in the paper is just a small part of it. There is still a lot work for further research.
