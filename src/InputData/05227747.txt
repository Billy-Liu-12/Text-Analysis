EQUATION OF STATE OF WARM DENSE MATTER AT DARHT-2 FACILITY*   Thomas. J. T. Kwan, Mark. J. Schmitt, William S. Daughton,  Carl A. Ekdahl, John F. Benage, Michael S. Murillo, Frederick J. Wysocki  Applied Physics Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory Los Alamos, NM 87544   Accurate equation-of-state theory on warm dense matter is a big challenge to model and good experimental data is difficult to obtain.  One of the difficulties is the creation of a warm dense matter (WDM) suitable for experiments to examine its equation of state.  We have examine methods of creating a warm dense matter using three different kinds of energetic particle beams such as short pulse laser, energetic proton beam, and relativistic electron beam.  We found that the use of relativistic electrons such as the second axis of the Dual Axis Radiographic Hydro-Test (DARHT) facility at Los Alamos National Laboratory can create WDM ideally suitable for experiments to obtain data on the equation of state of such WDM over an extended parameter space.  The electron beam has an energy of 18 MeV and a current of 2 kA.  Its pulse length can be varied from 20 ns to 200 ns.  We will present results from our calculations on the creation and characterization of WDM using the DARHT electron beam.

We will also present our planned experiments specifically for the measurements of equations of state of such a WDM.
