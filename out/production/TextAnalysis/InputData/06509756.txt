Stock Market Prediction model using TPWS and  Association Rules Mining

Abstract? The objective of this research is to classify or forecast the stock market from the general investor?s point of view. There are three parts in this research. In the first part we performed a survey on most of the well known data mining indicators, implemented the algorithms and calculated the accuracy by applying them on historical data. Then we presented an indicator algorithm which has higher accuracy compare to existing algorithms and it also provides a decision point that helps the investor to understand the significance of the result of the indicator. Finally we applied association rules mining to group the selected (based on precision) indicator algorithms to come up with a model to increase the overall accuracy. However motivating fact is we achieved far better results from our suggested model than other comparable indicator algorithms or strategy. For our research we used the data of Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE), capital market of Bangladesh.

I.  INTRODUCTION A stock market or equity market is a public market  for  the trading of company  stock  and derivatives at an agreed price. Investing on stock market needs a lot of research and analysis because stock market is the fastest and easiest way of making money but different types risk issues involved with it.

Technical Analysis is the analysis and forecasting of future financial price movements based on an examination of past price and volume movements. Though technical analysis does not result in absolute predictions about the future, it can help investors anticipate what is "likely" to happen to prices over time. Technical analysis is applicable to stocks, indices, commodities, futures or any tradable instrument where the price is influenced by the forces of supply and demand. Price refers to any combination of the open, high, low, or close for a given security over a specific time frame. The time frame can be based on intraday (1-minute, 5-minutes, 10-minutes, 15- minutes, 30-minutes or hourly), daily, weekly or monthly price data and last a few hours or many years. In addition, some technical analysts include volume or open interest figures with their study of price action [8].

In this research we considered 9 technical indicators based on their accuracy and proposed an indicator algorithm that provides decision as well as a point to understand the  significance of the decision which helps the investors to realize the importance of the forecasted decision.

Moreover we applied association rules mining to retrieve association rules based on the results of the traditional technical indicators and our proposed algorithm, and then we formed a model which works with higher accuracy than other individual indicator algorithms.

III. METHODOLOGY Stock market is playing a major role in the economy of  Bangladesh. Moreover Bangladesh?s stock market has witnessed impressive growth since 2007and also large number of new investors from across the country is entering the market. Therefore, to test the accuracy of prediction algorithms we used data of Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE).For this analysis, total 23 listed companies are considered. Of them, 18 companies highly traded and rest are infrequently traded. Two different types of companies in terms of liquidity, was taken to understand the applicability of this Analysis to illiquid share.

We applied the indicator algorithms on older data and check the prediction accuracy from confusion matrix for different periods. Data from years of 2009 and 2010,   have mostly used.

Finally we derived association rules based on results of highly accurate algorithms   to make the result more precise. To select the proper attributes/parameters for indicator algorithms we prepared five different training datasets from genuine record of Dhaka Stock Exchange.

IV. BACKGROUND STUDY Typically a technical indicator is some type of oscillation  of the price or volume based on parameters that are predefined depending on the market or the investor, and try to predict the future price levels, or simply the general price direction, of a security by looking at past patterns. Some of the precise indicators that we considered are discussed in this section.

A. RSI[12] RSI measures the internal strength of a single security. The  formula that have been used as follows; RS= (An average of upward price movement)/(An average  of downward price movement) RSI=100-100/(1+RS) The period used in our study is 18 days. If the RSI is above  80 and it is falling it gives a buy signal, if it is below 20 and shows an upward trend, it signals buy decision. We will get back to our parameter selection criteria later.

B. MFI[12] Money flow index is a momentum indicator that measures  the strength of money flowing in and out of a security. It is related to the Relative Strength Index, but where the RSI only incorporates prices, the Money Flow Index accounts for volume. It is calculated following the steps:  Typical price= (High + Low + Close)/3 Money Flow= Typical Price* Volume If today's Typical Price is greater than yesterday's Typical  Price, it is considered Positive Money Flow. If today's price is less, it is considered Negative Money Flow.

Money Ratio = Positive money Flow/ Negative Money Flow  MFI= 100 ? 100/ (1+MR) If the MFI is above 80 and it is falling it gives a buy signal,  if it is below 20 and shows an upward trend, it signals buy decision.

C. Stochastic Oscillator[12] The Stochastic Oscillator compares where a security's  price closed relative to its price range over a given time period. The Stochastic Oscillator is displayed as two lines. The main line is called "%K." .The second line, called "%D," is a moving average of %K.

% k= (Today?s Closing price-lowest low in % k periods)*100 /(Highest high in % k periods - lowest low in % k periods),  % D= A moving average of %K is then calculated using the number of time periods specified in the %D Periods.

For this study % k and % D, 14 days and 3 days period have been taken. The decision is buying when the Oscillator (either %K or %D) falls below a specific level (e.g., 20) and then rises above that level and the decision is selling when the Oscillator rises above a specific level (e.g., 80) and then falls below that level.

D. William %r[12] William is a momentum indicator that measures  overbought/oversold levels. The interpretation of Williams' %R is very similar to Stochastic Oscillator except that %R is plotted upside-down and the Stochastic Oscillator has internal smoothing.

William %R = (-100) * (Highest high in n periods- Today?s close)/(Highest high in n periods-Lowest low in n periods)  To display the Williams? %R indicator on an upside-down scale, it is usually plotted using negative values (e.g., -20%).

Ignoring the negative sign, readings in the range of 80 to 100% indicate that the security is oversold while readings in the 0 to 20% range suggest that it is overbought.

E. MACD[12] MACD is a trend following momentum indicator that  shows the relationship between two moving averages of prices. It has been calculated as follows:  MACD= 7 day Exponential Moving average- 13 day exponential moving average  The MACD is also useful as an overbought/oversold indicator. When the shorter moving average pulls away dramatically from the longer moving average (i.e., the MACD rises), it is likely that the security price is overextending and will soon return to more realistic levels. If the MACD line crosses the zero line from above, trend is bearish - sell signal; if the MACD moves above the zero line from below, trend is bullish- buy signal.

F. Bollinger Band[12] Bollinger Bands are similar to moving average envelopes.

The difference between Bollinger Bands and envelopes is envelopes are plotted at a fixed percentage above and below a moving average, whereas Bollinger Bands are plotted at standard deviation levels above and below a moving average.

Since standard deviation is a measure of volatility, the bands are self-adjusting: widening during volatile markets and contracting during calmer periods. Bollinger Bands are displayed as three bands:  Middle band = n period simple moving average Upper Band = Middle band + Standard deviation of n  period closing price Lower Band = Middle band - Standard deviation of n  period closing price The distinctive characteristic of Bollinger Bands is that the  spacing between the bands varies based on the volatility of the prices.

G. OBV[12] OBV is a momentum indicator that relates volume to price  change. It shows if volume is flowing into or out of a security.

When the security closes higher than the previous close, all of the day's volume is considered up-volume. When the security closes lower than the previous close, all of the day's volume is considered down-volume.

If today's close is greater than yesterday's close then: Today?s OBV= Yesterday?s OBV + Today?s volume If today's close is less than yesterday's close then: Today?s OBV= Yesterday?s OBV - Today?s volume When the OBV changes to a rising or falling trend, a  "breakout" has occurred. Since OBV breakouts normally precede price breakouts, investors should buy long on OBV upside breakouts.

Likewise, investors should sell short when the OBV makes a downside breakout. Positions should be held until the trend changes.

H. CCI[12] The Commodity Channel Index measures the variation of a  security's price from its statistical mean. High values show that prices are unusually high compared to average prices whereas low values indicate that prices are unusually low.

Contrary to its name, the CCI can be used effectively on any type of security, not just commodities. It is calculated by the following ways:  Typical Price= (high + low + close)/3 18 day simple moving average of typical price Average of Absolute value of (Each of 18 period day?s  typical price ? 18th day?s simple moving average) CCI= (Today?s Typical Price ? today?s 18th period  moving average)/( 0.015 * Step 3? value) The CCI typically oscillates between ?100. To use the CCI  as an overbought/oversold indicator, readings above +100 imply an overbought condition (and a pending price correction) while readings below -100 imply an oversold condition (and a pending rally).



I. ATR[12] Average True Ratio is a measure of volatility. The  calculation procedure is: True Range indicator = Maximum of ( The distance from  today's high to today's low, the distance from yesterday's close to today's high, the distance from yesterday's close to today's low)  ATR = Moving Average of True Ranges In this study, the period is of 18 days moving average.

High ATR values often occur at market bottoms following a "panic" sell-off. Low Average True Range values are often found during extended sideways periods, such as those found at tops and after consolidation periods.

V. PROPOSED INDICATOR: TYPICAL PRICE WEIGHTED STOCHASTIC(TPWS)  In the previous section we saw stochastic oscillator only works on the closing price of a security. It actually draws two lines to predict future movement of the security. But from our analysis we found out closing price in not an appropriate measure of a stock?s value because it represents only the last price when the trading ends or stops. Therefore we decided to use typical price, which is the average of high, low and close price. Moreover only price data is not sufficient to predict a stock?s pattern because it is important factor for a security to determine how much volume traded at which price.  For the above reason we customized the original stochastic algorithm and proposed typical price weighted stochastic (TPWS).

Similar to original stochastic algorithm it works on stage over two periods. It is calculated by the following ways:  Typical price= (High + Low + Close)/3 TPW= ((Typical Price-lowest typical price in last d1  period)* volume traded on lowest typical price)/(Highest high in d1 period * volume traded on highest typical price - lowest typical price in last d1 period)* volume traded on lowest typical price) * 100  TPWS= Moving average of TPW on d2 period From the study, we have chosen 14 days for d1 and 5 days  for d2.It provides decision based on result (buy, sell or hold) and also a point to represent the significance of the decision.

If today's TPWS is greater than Highrange then: Point= (TPWS - Highrange) /Highrange * 100 If today's TPWS is smaller than Lowrange then: Point= (Lowrange-TPWS) / Lowrange * 100 Else Point=Mod (Midrange-TPWS) / midrange * 100 For this study, TPWS point greater than 10 was considered  as 10 and negative values are considered as 0. A details pseudo code is given to understand the technique more clearly.

VI. PROPOSED MODEL FROM TPWS AND ASSOCIATION RULES MINING  Association rule mining, one of the most important and well researched techniques of data mining, was introduced first [9]. It aims to extract interesting correlations, frequent  patterns, associations or casual structures among sets of items in the transaction databases or other data repositories [10].

At the beginning of our study we selected nine indicators because of their exactness as well as they provide same type of outputs or their results can be interpreted into common output.

Our proposed algorithm also provides similar types of output which is Buy, Sell or Hold where buy means the stock price is going to increase and the investor is suggested to buy some shares, sell means the stock price will decrease soon so the investor is suggested to sell his/her shares if it?s in investor?s portfolio and hold means investor is suggested to keep their stock unchanged.

For different periods, we calculated the results of indicator algorithms and compared them with actual scenario to prepare a confusion matrix. One of them with periods, January 2009 is given in figure 3.

We can check the results of the analysis for 23 different stocks, all of them given in buy, sell or hold format.  The rightmost attribute ?Decision? indicates the correct decision which is calculated from 14th working days data after the analysis with a +/-10%  profit for Buy and Sell decision.

Figure 3.  Results of the indicators with actual result in same format.

We applied association rules mining on similar sets of data for different periods and retrieved lots of association rules but we selected only few rules by screening based on their accuracy.  Some of them are:  If (TPWS_point>5 and TPWS=?X?) => Decision=?X? Some of the association rules that we extracted from  association rules mining are: If (ATR=?Hold? and MFI=?hold? and Williams=?X?)  => Decision=?X?, Where accuracy=59.2%.

If(TPWS_point<5 and ATR=?Buy/Sell?) => Decision=?Buy/Sell?, where accuracy= 57.25%.

If (ATR=?Hold? and MFI=?hold? and OVB=?X?) => Decision=?X?, Where accuracy=56.2%.

TABLE I.  ACCCURACY CALCULATION  For the above association rule the accuracy from confusion matrix is 61.5%.

We summarized all the selected association rules by forming a model that provides more precise decision than any individual association rule or indicator algorithm. For all the extracted association rules we calculated the total accuracy, buy signal accuracy, sell signal accuracy, hold signal accuracy and sorted them based on their total accuracy. Then we combined the rules one after another in a decreasing order of accuracy unless the overall accuracy of any branch decreases.

Whenever we found any fall/drop of accuracy for adding a new association rule, we stopped the branching there and included the leaf nodes (buy, sell or hold) for the most recently added rule at that branch.

For example we started with TPWS Point because if it is greater than 5, then the algorithm works in more than 60% accurateness(table 1) and the accuracy started to decrease when TPWS point falls from 5 (i.e. Accuracy is 45.25% if TPWS point<5 ). So, we used another association rule for this branch. The figure 4 illustrates our proposed model based on the retrieved association rules.

VII. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND ANALYSIS This paper compares the existing indicator algorithms with  our proposed algorithm by applying them on historical data.

Moreover from association rules mining we extracted some important association rules which has higher accuracy rate and finally we proposed a model based on the rules.

To analyze the correctness we prepared five different training datasets and four different testing datasets from actual database of Dhaka Stock Exchange within the range 2009-10.

All the prices and volume data have been collected from CD of DSE library.

Figure 5.  The figure illustrates the mean accuracy for all the analyzed indicator algorithms and model (proposed techniques are round shaped bar)  To calculate the correctness of different models and indicators we used confusion matrix with Buy, Sell and Hold signal as illustrated in table 1.

We calculated correctness for four different test data sets for each indicator or model or rule and then took their mean( Average of four accuracy percentage) to decide the final accuracy. According to figure 5, our proposed model dominates all other indicators or rules with accuracy 73.92%.

Another proposed algorithm TPWS is in second position with accuracy of 69.5%.



VIII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK This research analyses some of the popular indicator  techniques, implemented them, and used training dataset to select high range, low range, time interval etc parameters and calculated their accuracy on test datasets. In addition we proposed a new technical indicator algorithm that provides decision as well as a significance point. Finally we applied association rules mining on all the results and recognized some precise rules which lead us to a model with highest accuracy among all the studied techniques in this study.

In future, we have planned to work on a textual analyzer to scrutinize news and rumor about the stocks to make the forecasting result more realistic and accurate.
