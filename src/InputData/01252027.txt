Index Term-Simultaneously Congested Link-Set, Frequent Item-set hlining. Data Mining, Ranking Mechanism  1. INTRODUCTlON ith the advancement of information collection and W '  processing technoloa. the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) has attracted more and more attentions  in its devclopment and research. Nowadays, more and more information theories and technologies, such as, the artificial intelligence, pattern recognition, control theory, etc, are widely used in the ITS.

Recently, the process of data mining and knowledge discovery is an emerging area of active research as focusing on the use and analysis of the large amount of data From the ITS data, previously unltnown or implicit information is extracted. such as association rules, frequent sequence pattcms, trends, clusters, etc. If data mining approaches are used in ITS, the discovered information will he very useful for the traffic control, route guidance or transportation programming. In this paper, we give an example of application of data mining approaches in ITS, which is the discovery of simultaneously congested link-sets through frequent item-set mining. Because the amount of discovered item-sets is great, a ranking mechanism is adopted to improve the efficiency of picking the most interesting link- sets.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives an overview on the definition and algorithms of frequent item- set mining. Section 3 discusses the approach for simultaneously congested link-set discovery based on the frequent item-set mining. Section 6 proposes a ranking  ~~ ~  REN Jiang-so.

At last, section 6 presents a conclusion and the future directions on the research.

11. FREQUENT ITEM-SETS MINING  Let I = {;, , i2 ; ' . i n }  be a set of items. A transaction T is a set of items and T C I  I associated with that transaction is a unique identifier. called its TID , where the transaction database D is a set of transactions. We sa) that a transaction T contains X I  a set of some items in I, if X E T  . The Supporr(X) is the probability of fransactions containing x in D ,  Let 5 is the predefined minimum support threshold. If Supporf(X)>c, then X is considered as a frequent item-set.

Nowadays, there are many algorithms for minins frequent item-seu, such as Apriori, FP-Growth, Eclat, etc.

and the Apriori algorithm is one of the most popular ones, and i s  briefly explained here. The basic idea of Apriori algorithm is that any subset of a frequent item-set must he frequent. Therefore, the candidate item-seu having k items can be generated by joining large item-sets having (k-I) items. And the algorithm can generate the candidate item- sets to be counted in a pass by using only the item-sets found frequent in the previous pass - without considering the transactions in the database. This procedure resuits in the generation of a much smaller number of candidate item- sets. Then by checking the support of each item-set coming from the candidate item-sets, the item-set whose support is greater than the threshold is recorded as a frequent item-set.

[I1[21  111. SIMULANEOUSLY CONGESTED LINK-SETS DISCOVERY  As we know, in the road network, some links are oAen congested simultaneously. Such information is very useful for traffic control, route guidance and transportation programming. But in the past, it can be found only by experience. In fact, data mining approaches, for example, frequent item-set mining, can help us discover these phenomena automatically and quickly. Lei us explain this in more detail below.

In each time-interval, for example, 15 minutes; we can get the status of many l i k s  of a road network relying on   http://nnitlvahoO.com   Imps or cameras. The status may be heavy congested, moderate congested, non-congested, etc. If only heavy congested status is considered, at each interval, we can get a set of links which are in heavy congested status. The labels of these links will then be selected out to form a new item- set, called transaction T . the time label of the interval can be taken as TID . The intervals at which no links are in heavy congested status will be omitted. So, in most individual intervals, we will get a transaction T , which indicated the heavy congested links at the time interval. All of the transactions form a transaction database D. Take the road network as shown in Fig 9 as an example. The road network is the part of all roads in Beijing. Total 58 links are considered with the number from 1 to 58.. Consider the cases in  which some of links are congested simultaneously.

These congested links can then be discovered by the approach described before. Some results are listed in Table I.

IV. RANKING DISCOVERED LINK-SETS  As we h o w .  the amount of discovered frequent item- sets is very great and the review of all the frequent item sets is then strenuously and impossible. As we are only interested in some of the discovered link-sets. some ranking measures must be employcd to give us the few and interesting link sets.

A ranking mechanism is used to help us finding the interesting link-sets more quickly and effectively. First. an evaluation criterion is defined to score the interest of each link-set. The score of a link-set is smaller; the priority of the link-set is higher. Then all of link-sets are ranking according their scores. Second. the link-sets with the highest priorities will be reviewed, and others may be omitted or filtered. It can improve the efficiency of finding useful item-sets greatly.

In fact, the score of a link-set is defined as the sum of the distances of any two different links in the set, while the distance of any two links is defined as the minimum number of links between these two links.

Generally, a connectivity matrix can be firstly constructed based on the geographic information. Let c..

I/  represents the element related to link i and link j in the matrix, if link i and link j are connected, otherwise c.. =I,  else, c.. =o. The steps getting the pare-wise link distance then can be enlisted as below:  rl I/  (I) Construct the connectivity matrix C ;  (2) Multiply c by itself, and record the number of multiplying as m ;  (3) If c.. change from zero to non-zero. m is the  distance of link i and link j  the any WO links are computed.



V. EXPERIMENTS  !I  (4) Repeat step (2) and (3) until all of the distance of  Take the example as shown in Fig I also. The mean link speed data coming from the SCOOT system of Beijing City is used. A road network (which is displayed in figure I )  comprising about 60 directional links is considered. The link speed is computed every 15-minutes, span from 2002.3 to 2002.10. Because of some reasons. such as malfunction of loops or communication links. the data has some mistakes. ARer clearing, there are I1662 valid data records.

Link speed less than I S M  is considered as heavy congested. For each record, the links whose speeds are below 15bh are presented as items of a transaction. For example, if in a time period t .  among the 60 link., only the speedsoflink 18,31.32,49and51 arebelow ISkm/h.then the item-set of period I is { I S ,  31. 32. 49, 51 ). The examples of the transactions are presented in table 1.

AAer the organization of transactions and database, we can use Aprioil algorithm [o disco\,er frequent simultaneously congested link sets. The minimum support threshold 4 is set as 10%. The mining results can be achieved as listed in table 2 and 3. Table 2 presented numbers of frequent item-sets according to different sizes of item-sets. Table 3 only presented the item-sets (simultaneously congested link set) whose support is highest according to different size. From table 3, we can see the link 51 has the highest probability of congestion. and link set (5 I, 3 I ,  5, 29.2, IS, 4, 3, 7, 8) is the largest one whose suppon is higher than 10% and they are oflen congested at the same time. Based on figure I ,  we can Rndthatlinksinset(2,3,4,5,7,8,51)andset(29,31) are adjacenf which is very useful in transportation management and planning.
