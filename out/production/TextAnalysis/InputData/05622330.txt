I.  INTRODUCTION  With the popularity of the Internet and e-business, e-  commerce system provides users with more choices.At the  same time, its structure becomes more complex, users often  lost in the information space of a large number of goods and  can not successfully find their own needed goods. E-  commerce recommendation system directly interact with  users to help customers find their own needed goods and  successfully complete the purchase process by simulating the  shop sales staff to recommendatie goods. Under the  increasingly competitive market environment, e-commerce    recommendation system can preserve the user and prevent  users from loss, may change visitors of e-commerce web site  into buyers, increase cross-selling ability of e-commerce web  site, enhance customers loyalty degree to the site, thereby  improve the sales of e-commerce systems. Recommendation  system in e-commerce has good prospects of development  and application. With the further expansion of the scale of e-  commerce systems, however e-commerce recommendation  systems also face the recommendation low accuracy and  weak timeliness problems in providing personalized product  recommendation services to their customer.

Web mining is the application of data mining  technologies on the Internet to extract interesting, useful  patterns and implicit information from activities related to  WWW. Web mining technique is introduced to e-commerce  recommendation system, by means of data mining  technology to be used for automatically, quickly discovering  the visitor's browsing patterns (eg. frequent access web page  groups, user groups, etc.) from web log data. Basing on  visitor's browsing patterns, the site can efficiently and  automaticly dynamic adjust web pages content, and  recommend right items for each customer to provide  personalized recommendation service. With the personalized  goods recommendation service e-commerce system attracts  more visitors.



II. PERSONALIZED RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM  ARCHITECTURE OF E-COMMERCE  Personalized recommendation system of e-commerce  uses the technology of Web log mining to obtain the user's  access patterns from the Web logs. And based on user access  tendency the site can provide a real-time view of the adaptive  web pages that might interest the user. The system mainly  consists of two implementation modules[1][2]: off-line and  on-line.

A.  off-line module  This module is mainly responsible for discovering the  web site visitor browsing patterns from the web site log files,  filtering these patterns, establishing user clustering groups,  and finally obtaining recommended model library. The  procedure is shown in Figure 1.

On-line module  Real-time recommendation engine recognizes the user's  current session, obtains each user's current access sequence,  then the sequence will be loaded into the model library  Real-time recommendation engine outputs the next possible  goods web page accessed by the users. The web page's URL  can be attached to the bottom of the current use. The  procedure is shown in Figure 2.

III. THE PERSONALIZED RECOMMENDATIONS PROCESS IN  E-COMMERCE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM  The off-line part of personalized recommendation system  of e-commerce mainly uses the technology of web log  mining. Users log information of commercial activity and  browsing access in the web site is recorded in the log file.

The so-called log refers to the  variety of related Web log  files about users access on the web server, including access  logs, reference logs, agent logs, error logs and other  documents. These files contain a large amount of  information about a user accessing to the web server, such as  the user's IP address, visited URL, access date and time ,  access methods (GET or POST), the visit results (success,  failure, error), the information content.

The typical Web server logs include the following  information:  c-IP Address: IP address of the user that access the web  server .

user ID (cs-username): is the page being visited and  the  need for user authentication only, without any certification of  a page, was empty.

s-ip: IP address of the server being accessed.

s-port: the port is accessed to the server.

cs-method: refers to the way of user to access, for  example, GET or POST; some also recorded the use of  protocols such as http or ftp and so on.

cs-url: is visiting the web page(Uniform Resource    Locator).

sc-status: the final visited state (results), the typical  values are:200 means successful access,404 means  the  requested page is not found .

Size: is the size of requested page.

Referer: are the Refering page.When a web browser  follows a link from one page to another (or even to a  graphic), it tells the web server where it found the link. This  is called the Refering page.

cs (User-Agent): are that the user browser type, version  and running operating system.

The following is a web server log snippet of a  commercial web site on 2009-10-29:  2009-10-29 00:03:51 220.156.32.79 - 220.156.35.1 80  GET /movie/movie.asp page=1&movietypes=all 200  Mozilla/4.0+(compatible;+MSIE+6.0;+Windows+NT+5.0)  2009-10-29 00:03:51 220.156.32.79 - 220.156.35.1 80  GET /movie/images/filmtop.gif - 200  Mozilla/4.0+(compatible;+MSIE+6.0;+Windows+NT+5.0)  2009-10-29 00:03:51 202.196.32.79 - 202.196.35.1 80  GET /movie/filmtop_jc.gif - 200  Mozilla/4.0+(compatible;+MSIE+6.0;+Windows+NT+5.0)  Although different users may have different browsing  patterns at different times, but generally its long-term trend is  stable. Web log mining from web log can find the browsing  patterns that the user access web pages, find out the  regularity, further through statistical analysis identify  similarities and associated user groups, and the intrinsic  relations between web pages. So as to improve site  performances, organizational structure, and the quality and  efficiency to find information for the users.

Web log mining process can be divided into two  stages[3]: data preprocessing and log mining algorithms  executing. When algorithms are executed, user interest  patterns and user clustering are obtained.

A.  Data pre-processing  Data pre-processing is a fundamental stage of web log  mining. Usually, it makes the original log files into a user  session through a series of data processing operations, such  as data cleaning, user identification, session identification,  and so on.

Data cleaning mainly filters out irrelevant or redundant    items. For example: In a log file,. Gif,. Ico,. Css,. Jpg  segments can be deleted, which should not have impact on  mining analysis results. For another example, usually a  counter script file "count.cgi" in the home page also can be  deleted.

User identification is an important part of web log mining,  and its success is directly related to the accuracy of mining  results. User identification also is base of users cluster  analysis and personalized recommendation service.

The purpose of session identification is to divide the  users browsing access into different conversations. The  easiest way is the time-window approach, through which if  the interval of two browsing accesses from a user is over a  certain time threshhold, we think that the user started another  session. In actually running, we use 30 minutes as the default  time window.

B.  Implementation of Data Mining Algorithms  In recommendation technology, a key issue is to  determine the right data mining algorithms, and a reasonable  method can meet e-commerce applications requirements.

Algorithms proposed by researcher include: association rules,  clustering, collaborative recommendation technology [4][5],  and so on. This paper discusses the clustering technology [6]  to deal with browsing information for personalized  recommendations.

V12-409  For processing e-commerce web site topology and user's  browsing information, the UserID-URL associated matrix is  established, with UserID (user's IP address) for rows and e-  commerce Web site URL page for columns, and the element  value is the user number of access page. On this basis, we  can cluster the row vector to find similar user groups, the  colomn vector analysis to identify the list of similar pages,  further the frequent page set (frequent access path) can be  found.

1)  description of user behaviors  We denote Web server logs as L = <ip,url,time> after a  certain pre-processing on logs, where ip, url, time,  representing web access user, the page is requested to access  and the corresponding browse time respectively.

2) the establishment of UserID-URL associated matrix    According to the log information, We can set up the  following UserID-URL associated matrix:        where hi,j is the browse residence time that the user i visits  the first j pages (URL)in a specific period. Each row vector  means the situation of the site's pages(URL) to be access by  the user; Each column vector means the situation that all  users visits on this page (URL). Therefore, the row vector  reflects the user type, and also sketches out the user's  personalized access. The column vector represents the  structure of the site, also contains a common user access  patterns. So similar users group (ie the same type of users)  can be obtained directly by the similarity from row vectors,  and the recommended pages can be obtained from other  similar users in the group to visit page.

3)  similarity measure  Similarity measure between vectors can be calculated by  the hamming distance. First of all in the UserID-URL  associated matrix, if the element Mi, j> 0 (hi,j >0), Mi,j=1 is  hold, and the purpose of such handling simplifies the  computational complexity. We dont consider the user's  residence time in the past page but consider whether the user  visited this page. Then, the hamming distance between  vectors can be calculated. Smaller hamming distance means  higher similarity.

Following is Hamming distance definition:  Set X, Y is a vector of  only 0 or 1, then the hamming  distance Hd (X, Y) between X and Y to the following  formula:  ||),(  ||||   ?

=  ?=  x  i  iid YXYXH  (1)  Suppose vector X = (1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1), vector Y =  (1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0, 0,0,0,1)indicate the situations of the user X    and user Y to access the 12 pages respectively. From which  we can find that user X browses the six pages of 1,3,4,5,7,12,  and the user Y browses the five pages of 1,3,4,7,12. There is  only one different access page between the two users, then  we can directly perceive that the two users is similar. The  result of 1 calculated by hamming distance formula means  the highest degree of similarity between them. If the vector  Y = (0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0), i.e. the user Y browses pages  different completely from the user X, on the contrary, the  result of 12 is calculated by hamming distance formula, and  means that they not have similarities.

4) User Clustering  User clustering will firstly pre-process the UserID-URL  associated matrix, if the element Mi, j> 0,  Mi, j = 1 is hold.

And then the hamming distance between row vectors is  calculated in order to establish the new distance matrix Dm*m  between the row vectors. In the symmetric distance matrix  Dm*m , the element di,j represents the first i row vector with  the first j row vectors of the hamming distance, and the value  of diagonal elements is 0 in the new distance matrix Dm*m.

Then the size of threshold about user similarity  calculated according to the following formula?

??

= = ?=  m  i  m  j  ji  mm  dA  1 1  ,  )]1([2  (2)  If di,j<A, the user i and all users j which meet the  conditions will be dropped into a cluster (users group).

Applying the above data mining algorithms, We obtain  the result of clusters (users group) into model libraries. The  online module of e-commerce recommendation system finds  that the online access user i is in a cluster (users group), then  the system can recommend the goods which other users in  this cluster browsed to the user i, to achieve the objective of    personalized goods recommendation. Because we believe  that a cluster (users group) have similar preferences to these  goods. Of course we will enable the enterprise provide  personalized information services and targeted e-commerce  activities to customers.



IV. CONCLUSION  This paper introduces the UserID-URL associated matrix  according to log information, and the mthod is simple and  easy to improve the nature of algorithm,without the  candidate set of Apriori algorithm in association rules. We  calculate UserID-URL associated matrix and Distance  matrix to cluster users into groups, and recommend  effectively personalized recommend goods to which the user  may prefer. The method also may enable enterprises offer  personalized information services and e-commerce activities  to customers, and increase the merchandise sales on e-  commerce site.
