Integrating Fuzziness into OLAP for Multidimensional Fuzzy Association Rules Mining

Abstract  This paper contributes to the ongoing research on multidimensional online association rules mining by proposing a general architecture that utilizes a fuzzy data cube for knowledge discovery. Three different methods are introduced to mine fuzzy association rules in the constructed fuzzy data cube, namely single dimension, multidimensional and hybrid association rules mining. Experimental results obtained for each of the three methods on the adult data of the United States census in 2000 show their effectiveness and applicability.

1. Introduction  Earlier approaches for quantitative association rules mining require discretizing the domains of quantitative attributes into intervals in order to discover quantitative association rules. But, these intervals may not be concise and meaningful enough for humans to obtain nontrivial knowledge from the discovered rules. Also, existing quantitative mining algorithms either ignore or over- emphasize elements near the boundary of an interval.

Instead of using sharp intervals, some work has recently been done on the use of fuzzy sets in discovering association rules among quantitative attributes in flat tables, e.g., [3, 9].

These approaches assume a flat relational table structure.

In this paper, we apply the same fuzziness concepts to OLAP data mining, where the basic structure is a data cube.

A cube is a set of data organized similar to a multidimensional array of values representing measures over several dimensions. Explicitly, OLAP mining integrates online analytical processing with data mining; this substantially enhances the power and flexibility of data mining and makes mining an interesting exploratory process, e.g., [7, 8]. So, generating online association rules is considered an important research area of data mining, e.g., [1, 4, 5, 6]. Although these algorithms improved the online generation of association rules, it is still an open problem.

They use data cubes with binary attributes, whereas most real life databases include quantitative attributes. Motivated by this, we developed a novel approach for online association rules mining.

We contribute to the ongoing research on multidimensional online data mining by proposing a general  architecture that constructs and uses a fuzzy data cube for knowledge discovery. This allows users to query a given database for fuzzy association rules for different values of support and confidence. We present three different methods to mine fuzzy association rules in the constructed fuzzy data cube, namely one-dimensional, multi-dimensional and hybrid (integrates the two other methods) fuzzy association rules mining. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to utilize fuzziness in OLAP mining. Experimental results obtained on the adult data of United States census in 2000 show the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed three methods.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the basic terminology used in the rest of the paper. Section 3 presents the three proposed fuzzy data cube based mining methods. Experimental results for the adult data of the United States census in 2000 are reported and discussed in Section 4. Section 5 includes a summary and the conclusions.

Fuzzy Data Cube Construction  Our target is to integrate fuzziness with OLAP association rules mining. To achieve this, we constructed a model that builds a fuzzy data cube first, and then utilizes the fuzzy data cube in mining fuzzy association rules. The proposed architecture, shown in Figure 1, consists of three main parts: 1) data warehouse, 2) fuzzy data cube and OLAP server, and 3) fuzzy association rules mining system. The major task of an OLAP server is to compute user?s OLAP instructions, such as creating data cube, drilling, dicing, etc.

The fuzzy association rules mining system is responsible for the extraction of fuzzy association rules from the constructed fuzzy data cube.

So, consider a quantitative attribute, say x. It is possible to define some fuzzy sets for x, with a membership function per fuzzy set, such that each value of x qualifies to be in one or more of these fuzzy sets. Let },...,,{ 21 lxxxx fffF = be a set of l fuzzy sets associated with x. Membership function of the  j-th fuzzy set in xF , denoted jxf? , represents a mapping from the domain of x into the interval [0,1]. If 1)( =vj  xf ? then  value v of x totally belongs to fuzzy set jxf . On the other  hand, 0)( =vj xf  ? means that v is not a member of jxf . All other values between 0 and 1, exclusive, specify ?partial membership?. This concept is used next in building a fuzzy data cube.

Each dimension of the cube  contains 1  + ?  =  k  i il values, where il is the number of  membership functions of attribute xi, k is the number of attributes, both in dimension X, and ?+1? represents a special ?Total? value in which each cell stores the aggregation value of the previous rows. Finally, a three-dimensional fuzzy data cube is shown in Figure 2, where each dimension has two attributes and the number of membership functions of each attribute varies between 2 and 3.

As the target is to find out some interesting and potentially useful fuzzy association rules with enough support and high confidence, we end this section with the definition of fuzzy association rule.

Consider a database of transactions T, its set of attributes I, and the fuzzy sets associated with quantitative attributes in

I. Each transaction ti contains values of some attributes from I and each quantitative attribute in I is associated with at least two corresponding fuzzy sets. A fuzzy association rule is defined as follows.

If X={x1, x2, ?, xp} is A={f1, f2, ?, fp} then Y={y1, y2, ?, yq} is B={g1, g2, ?, gq},  where X, Y are itemsets, i.e., disjoint subsets of I, and A and B contain the fuzzy sets associated with corresponding attributes in X and Y, respectively, i.e., fi is a fuzzy set related to attribute xi and gj is a fuzzy set related to attribute yj.

3. OLAP Mining of Fuzzy Association Rules  3.1. Single Dimension Method  Single dimension association rules mining concentrates on the correlation within one dimension by grouping the other dimension. Shown in Figure 3 is an example of such a cube with two dimensions involved in the single dimension association rules mining process. One of the dimensions is referred to as transaction dimension and the set of attributes associated with it constitute the other dimension.

By grouping attributes in the transaction dimension, a transaction table can be transformed into a set-based table in which items sharing the same transactional attribute are merged into one tuple. Note that there is no point in partitioning attributes in the transactional dimension into fuzzy sets because the mining process is performed in the non-transactional dimension.

After constructing the fuzzy data cube, the process of association rules mining starts by identifying large itemsets.

An itemset is large if it is a combination of items that have a support over a predefined minimum support. The mining process and hence identifying large itemsets is performed based on the sum of sharing rates, denoted SR, and defined in terms of the degree of membership in the fuzzy sets. If more than one membership function intersect with the real values of an attribute, then all the cells related to these functions are updated. So, each cell in Figure 3 stores an SR value.

To generate fuzzy association rules, all sets of items that have a support above a user specified threshold should be determined first. Itemsets with at least a minimum support value are called large itemsets. The fuzzy support value of itemset Y and its corresponding set of fuzzy sets F, denoted FSupport(Y, F) is computed as:  Totalsum  fxFfSR FYFSupport  Xinxallfor  n ji  n jYy fyi j  n jj  ? ? ?  = ? ).,(  ),( ),(  3.2. Multidimensional Method  In this method, the correlation is among a set of dimensions, i.e., the items forming a rule come from different dimensions. Therefore, each dimension should be partitioned at the fuzzy set level.

Here, consider a fuzzy data cube with 3 dimensions, if values of attributes xi, yj and zk have membership degrees  )( i m x? , )( jn y? and )( ko z? in fuzzy sets  m if ,  n jf and  o kf ,  respectively, then sr of the fuzzy sets of the corresponding cell is computed as )( i  m x? . )( jn y? . )( ko z? . This may be generalized for n-dimensions. So, the frequency for each itemset can be directly obtained from one cell of the fuzzy cube. In a way similar to the single dimension case, each cell stores the product of the membership grades of different items, one item per dimension. As the example data cube shown in Figure 2 has three dimensions, each cell stores the product of the membership grades of three items, one from each of the three dimensions. Finally, the fuzzy support value of each cell is calculated as follows:  sumTotal  SR FSupport = .

3.3. Hybrid Method  This method is based on a hybrid structure, which combines single and multidimensional rules without repetitive items within one dimension. In this case, each  candidate itemset can be written as multisinglehybrid LLL ?  = , where singleL and multiL are the items from one dimension and  multi-dimensions, respectively.

The reason for using this new method is to provide the  opportunity for one dimension to dominate over others. This dominating dimension corresponds to the one referred to as non-transactional dimension in the single dimension method.

The motivation is to overcome the database size problem as follows; instead of looking for all possible associations, we look for rules containing specific items in a fuzzy data cube.

The problem is reduced into how to efficiently identify itemsets which are relevant to our data requirements, and then construct association rules that satisfy our needs. This way, we avoid considering data and rules that do not meet the current data requirements.

To illustrate this, consider the 3-dimensional fuzzy data cube shown in Figure 2. If the three dimensions X, Y and Z are assumed to represent the transaction, the dominating (non-transaction) and the other dimension, respectively, then we can obtain a rule including the triplet (y1, y2, z1), with its fuzzy support calculated as:  Totalsum  fyfxFfSR FSupport  Zzinonlyxallfor  n jj  m ii  n jYy fyi j  n jj  ])).(.(,[  .),(  ? ?? ? ?=  4. Experimental Results  We performed some empirical tests in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. All of the experiments were conducted on a Pentium III, 1.4GHz CPU with 512 MB of memory and running Windows 2000. As experimental data, we constructed the fuzzy data cube using 10 attributes and 100K transactional records from the adult data of the United States census in 2000.

Each set of tests necessitates the construction of a fuzzy data cube which complies with the requirements of the method under investigation; for each dimension of the cube, a set of attributes was picked up from the experimental database.

Finally, each set consists of two experiments to evaluate our approach with respect to the following dimensions: 1) number of association rules generated for different values of minimum support and different minimum confidence values, namely, 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7; and 2) number of association rules generated for different values of minimum support and different numbers of fuzzy sets, namely 3, 4 and 5 fuzzy sets, denoted FS3, FS4 and FS5, respectively. Note that in the experiments, unless otherwise specified, the minimum confidence and the number of fuzzy sets have been set to 0.6 and 4, respectively.

The first set of experiments was carried out to test the first method on a 2-dimensional fuzzy data cube with 6 attributes used to construct the non-transaction dimension; the results are shown in Figures 4 and 5. According to Figure 4, the number of the rules mined decreases as the minimum support value increases. This is quite consistent with our intuition. Also, the curve is smoother as the minimum confidence value increases. This means that the minimum support value has large effect on the number of mined rules for smaller minimum confidence values. As Figure 5 is concerned, larger number of fuzzy sets generates more rules for FS3 and FS4. However, as the minimum support value increase, the curve of FS5 drops quickly and after a particular minimum support value, it generates fewer rules     than the others. This is reasonable since a large number of fuzzy sets will easily scatter quantities of an item from different transactions in different sets.

In the second set of experiments, we applied the second method on a 3-dimensional fuzzy data cube; each dimension has 3 quantitative attributes. The results are shown in Figures 6 and 7. The curves plotted in Figure 6 show the relationships between number of rules mined and minimum support values for different values of minimum confidence.

The numbers of association rules produced for different number of fuzzy sets are given in Figure 7. In this case, each itemset of a given rule is coming from different dimensions.

It is worth mentioning that the same interpretation about Figures 4 and 5 is valid for Figures 6 and 7, respectively.

The last set of experiments is dedicated to testing the hybrid method on the same 3-dimentional fuzzy data cube used in the previous set of experiments. The results are shown in Figures 8 and 9. The same interpretation for Figures 4 and 5 are also valid for Figures 8 and 9, respectively. As the results obtained from all the three methods are consistent, it is anticipated that our approach presented in this paper is equally effective regardless of the number of fuzzy sets utilized in the process.

Summary and Conclusions  In this paper, we proposed a general architecture that utilizes a fuzzy data cube for knowledge discovery in quantitative attributes. Also, we presented three different methods for the online mining of fuzzy association rules from the proposed architecture. One method deals with the  mining of fuzzy association rules in 2-dimensional fuzzy data cube. The other two methods handle the mining process in multidimensional fuzzy data cube. We have already tested the last two methods on a 3-dimensional fuzzy data cube.

The experiments conducted on adult data of the United States census in 2000 showed that the proposed approach produces meaningful results and has reasonable efficiency.
