Abstract  A new suboptimal approach to the probability data association of multitarget tracking, the Dominant Probability Data Association (DPDA) , is presented in this paper. In view of the fact that the case where many targets cross together or move in a very ?small? neighborhood, rarely occurs for mast practical multitar- get tracking enviroments we may define a dominant joint event and corresponding dominant joint probability. Using Bayesian rule, we can deduce a formula of the dominant joint probabili- ties without calculating the all joint probabilities of all joint events such as in joint probability data association (JPDA). So, the DPDA can avoid the problem of combinatarial ?explosion? in JPDA. In addition, we prove that the top limit of perfor- mance of DPDA is equal to that of JPDA and the low limit is not lower than that of probability data association (PDA) and that the event with low limit is the one with very small probability.

Monte Carlo simulation results give out inspiring performance.

1. INTRODUCTION  In most practical multiple target tracking enviroments, there is no probability that many targets cross together or move in a very ?small? neighborhood. If so, the group target tracking method would be considered. Assuming that there are T targets in a surveillance region and Tc(Tc= 1 , 2 ,  ,T)  targets in a ?small? neighborhood of the region, let p(Tc/T) represent the probabili- ty of the event that Tc of T targets appear in the ?small? neigh- borhood. Obviously for Tc /T=l /T ,  we will have p(Tc/T)% 1 ;  and for Tc /T=l  and large number T ,  p(Tc/T)&O. Fur- ther more, p(Tc/T) will decrease sharply along with Tc/T in- creasing. This fact gives us an inspiration that those joint events with very small joint probabilities may be left out. Hereon we define the joint events with Tc<2 as dominant joint events and corresponding joint probabilities as dominant joint probabilities.

The rest of joint events with Tc>2 will be disregarded. Using Bayesian rule we can deduce a fomula calculting marginal proba- bility. where there is no need to calculate all joint probabilities of all joint events thus avoiding the combinatorial ?explosion? problem existing in JPDA. For the case of TcG.2, the results of DPDA will be the same as JPDA; and for Tc=T,T>2 its per- formances will be not lower than that of PDAC?I.

In ordinary PDA only the case of p (1/T)  = 1 is considered.

That is, there is only one target in validation region. The ordi-  nary PDA uses a normalized version of the simple likelihood function as the association probability and is, in general, a sub- optimal estimation procedure. When there are multiple targets in a validation region and the gates of targets are over lapped each other, the JF?DA[2] will be used. In JPDA, it is assumed that p (Tc/T) = 1 ,  for Tc = 1,2, .a-, T. That is to say all the joint events are of equal ?importance? and we should consider all joint events without regarding their real occurring probabilities.

The definition of joint event in JPDA is as follows:  m(k>  E= rc, (1) where GIb{measurement r originated from torget t 1  and t, is the index of the target with which the measurement r is associated in the event under consideration. In order to reduce the number of joint events following feasibility rules are used.

(1) One measurement can have only one source; (2) No more than one measurement can originate from one tar- get.

However the number of feasible joint events can be as large as the product of the numbers of returns in the validation regions.

The increae in complexity for the computation of association probabilities may prove significant for a number of targets even in moderately dense clutter.

There have been some efforts to approach the performance of the JPDA by imitating its properties via ad hoc association rulesc3] or its modified rules[?] and via combinatorial  method^[^.^]. Howev- er, the effectiveness of these approximations in tracking multiple targets in the presence of clutter will not be guaranteed. The neural solution[?] to the multitarget tracking data association problem is of good performance. However for real-time multi- target tracking by a microprocessor associated with an airborne track-while-scan radar system it has some problems remain to be solved.

In fact, There is no need to consider the joint events with very small p(Tc/T). In JPDA the definition of feasible joint event encompasses almost everything and leads to heavy and compli- cated computations. In this paper, section 2 presents a formula- tion of estimation. Section 3 deduces the formula of marginal probability in DPDA and section 4 shows the simulation results of typical example . The last is conclusion.

DOMINANT PROBABILITY DATA ASSOCIATION  The target dynamics are modelled as follows:  where x(k) is n-dimension state vector, F(k)  is transition ma- trix and v ( k )  is assumed to be a normally distributed p r o u s noise, with zero mean and known variance  The initial state vector is also assumed to be normally distributed with mean x(O/O) and covariance p(O/O), and independent of  The measurement equations are:  where z ( k )  is r-dimension measurement vactor, H ( k )  is a known (r  X n j matrix and w (k)  is assumed to be a normally distributed measurement noise, independent of v (k) and f (o/ 0) , with zero mean and known variance  E ( w (k ) W' ( 1 ) ) = R (k )&I (5 ) The set of validated measurements at time k is denoted by  Z(k )& { Zi (k) )?Ab) (6) The cumulative set of measurements up to time k is denoted by  Zk-(Z(j) ))-I The minimum variance estimate or conditional mean is therefore  x(k+l)=F(k)x(k)+v(k)  (2)  E(v(k)v'( 1) )=Q(k)&i ( 3 )  v(k).

Z(k)=H(k)x(k)+w(k) (4 )  (8)  The above equation is the mathematical basis of the optimal esti- mate in the m. m. s. e. sense. Further more we assume that  P[x(k)/Zk-']=N[x(k);x(klk-1) ,P(klk- l ) ]  (9) Define dominant joint event, corresponding to target;  m(k)  Ei ( j  n( rQ sI,) 1 2 1  i=Orl,...,m(k),t=l,2,...,T (10) A dominant joint event will satisfy following rules rule 1. the number of clutter q satisfies  rule 2.

For return i ,  if target t#j, then tl#j,; Define the marginal association probabilities :  m(k) -T<q<m(k)  According to the assumptions of dominant joint event mentioned above, for Tc>2, P(Tc/T)*O, these events are mutually ex- clusive and exhanstive , and hence:  (12) m(k)  r=O 1 13: (k) = 1 , t= 1 ,2, ,T  Using the results of PDAF we can get the following estimation algorithm directly :  m(k)  ,PO x'(kIkj=x'(klk-l)+K'(k) I: E(k)v:(k) (13)  P' (k I k ) = Bb (k ) P' (k I k - 1 ) -I- [ 1 - & (k )]E (k I k) -kFt (k (14)  m(k)  r-I p(k)=K'(k)[  Z ff(k)~:(k)-~:(k)~:'(k)]K''(k) (15)  P~(kIk)=[I-K'(k)HL(k)]P(kIk-l)  (16)  P'(k4-1 Ik)=F'(k)P(k I k)P'(k)fQ1(k) (17) where t is the index of the tth filter of the target being tracked.

Using Bayesian rule, we can get the formula of dominant proba- bility data association :  <j>/Zk-' ) (18) where c1 is normalization constant, ZI (k  ) AZ (k ) - ( Z, (k ) ) , E F,,, Ftja ( rGosl,), t, is the index of the target with which  measurement r is associated in the event under consideration and r=O, 1 ,-.m(k), rfi.

(28), (31), (329, we have  I Z I T  From (33) we know, when T&, P { ql I Zk ) will be the same as JPDA; when T,>2 and P(Tc/T)=O, P{ell/Zk) will be a p proximately equal to PDA. That is to say, in DPDA, the top limit of performance will be equal to that of JPDA and the low limit will be not lower than that of PDA and also, the events with low limit will be the events with very small occuring proba- bilities.

The difference in form between the (33) and the ad hoc formula in SPDA[3] is that, in DPDA, we modify both of the numerator and denominator under the definition of dorminant joint events.

However, the ad hoc formula[3] is experientially modified in the denominator only.

4. MONTE CARLO SIMULATION  100 runs of Monte Carlo simulations also have been done for 10 crossing targets shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2.

The dynamics of the target and the measurement equations are:  x f (k+l )  =F:(k)x;(k) +Uf(k)af(k)+vI(k) i= 1,2 Zl(k)=H'(k)xl(k)+wl(k)  Here we use the model which presented in the Ref [SI.

The variance of the process: noise is QI.

The variance of measurement noise is  R(k)=diag(r. r,.) The true measurement is detectcd at any given time with proba- bility PO = 0. 9 and falls into gate with probability PO = 0. 9.

The number of clutter points is Passion-distributed and their Io- cations in the measurement space are uniformly distributed over a very broad region about the actual track. The clutter density is

I.= 0. 5k1n-~ with varying gate sizes, this will range from 0. 2 to 2. 0 false detections per gate.

In Tab. 1 and Tab. 2, the root-mean-square (rms) values of DPDA are equal to that of JPDA and the percentage of lost tracks 6. 7% is also equal to JPDA.

5. CONCLUSIONS  A new suboptimal approach to the probability data association is presented in this paper based upon the definition of dominant joint events and corresponding dominant joint probabilities. The approach of DPDA is developed for the application to real-time multitarget tracking by a microprocess or associated with an air-     borne track-while-scan radar system. The performance of DP- DA is superior to other simplified JPDA algorithms and the com- putation berdurn is only a little great than that of PDA.
