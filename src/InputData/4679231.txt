I. INTRODUCTION  Nowadays, with the increase of mobile network users, the development of mobile networks and the occurrence of new kinds of application, the competition of mobile network operators become more intense. The traffic of mobile telecommunication is increasing sharply. Meanwhile, the division of users is more and more specific. In this case, drastic competition and various users? demands impel network operators to think about more specific telecommunication service market. Therefore, most operators are considering providing creative personalized service to users.

As for users, they have different demands to application due to different interests, different purpose and different environment. They often fall into dilemma because of a lot of trash application when they search for what they want. So, it is necessary to provide personalized application recommendation for these users.

Today, technology of personalized service has been applied to different fields. Modern personalized service system provides pertinent services for different users to meet their  different demands. By collecting and analyzing users' behavior, personalized service system can implement recommending application actively. In the field of Internet, personalized service can improve the quality of WEB service and the efficiency of users? access. In the field of telecommunication, this technology can help to win customers? satisfaction as well as benefit to popularize some new kinds of application and can bring incredible profit to operators.

Considering these factors mentioned above, it is of great necessity to design and implement specific application recommendation system for mobile users to meet different users? various demands. In this section, background of the system is described. In section 2, the construct of personalized application recommendation system is depicted. Section 3 focuses on introducing the method to establish the mobile network users? model and the algorithm to find out the users? true interests. The personalized recommendation engine is described in section 4. An experiment and detailed analysis is introduced in section 6. And in section 7, the conclusion of this paper is described.



II. THE STRUCTURE OF PERSONALIZED APPLICATION RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM IN THE OTA SYSTEM  Personalized application recommendation system in the OTA system is also divided into server part and client part. The communication between the two parts is implemented by using some mobile communication protocols such as WAP and GRPS. The model of the system can be shown as below.

The    detailed    description    of    the    structure    of    the personalized application recommendation system in the OTA system can be expressed as below:  Client:  1) User?s requests  It can send data includes requests and other information to server.

2) User?s feedback     Figure 1. the structure of personalized application recommendation  recommendation system in the OTA system.

It can register user?s behavior when they use the system and send information to sever in order that the server can adjust user?s model and recommendation rule.

Server:  1) Authenticating user  It can authenticate users; only authenticated users can use this system.

2) Modeling user  It can model users. Users may have different interests to application; modeling user based on users? interests is the core of personalized application recommendation system which can collect users? different demands.

3) Matching pertinent data  It can match pertinent data based on some specific rules for users in service database to make decision and provide valuable application for users according to the established model of users, considering different users? interests and orientation.

4) Sending Recommendation results  It can send data to mobile terminators. The data include the results of recommendation and detailed application.



III. MINE USER?S INTERESTS ON MOBILE NETWORKS  A. Building mobile user?s interests model  The method to build mobile user?s interests mode can be described as below:  1) Analyze user?s logs, and gets user?s information about application downloading and using when he or she uses this system.

2) Compute the user?s interest degree kI  which can be  divided into two parts downloading interest degree dI  and  using interest degree uI to every application category in a day:  =  += N  i i  i d  m  M NI   )1ln(                     (1)  d  k u  n  n I =                                (2)  udk III +=                             (3)  kI  means the user?s interest degree to every application  category in a specific day, N is the frequency of the user?s  using the system to download application, iM represents the  number of the pieces of application when the user downloads  this kind of application at the ith times, im  is the total number  of the application which is added into the system when the user downloads this kind of application at the ith  times. kn represents the frequency of user?s using kth category  of application. dn is the average frequency of user?s using  every category of application.

3) Produce the matrix of user?s interests  The user?s interest model is defined as a matrix which is  made of k  rows and d  lists. k  is equal to the number of categories of application, while d amounts to the number of days in which the user utilizes the system. d  can be limited from 0 to m , for instance, m  can be equal to 7. The elements located in the cross by i  row and j  list as the user?s interest  degree on the ith category of application in the jth day iI .

4) Compute the user?s base interest degree on the kth category of application.

The formulation is d  I  I  d  i  i  k == 1 , 4 , d  is equal to the  lists of the user?s interests matrix.

5) Arraign the categories of application according to the results calculated above, output the degree by which the user pays attention to these categories of application.

B. An algorithm used to find out the user?s true interests  Step 1: Filter the logs.  Weed useless registers such as the using time less than a week, unsuccessful downloading operation due to some accidents including the network errors.

Step 2: Separate every user?s data from the logs including the categories, the number of pieces of application downloaded and used, the number of pieces of new application which is added recently.

Step 3: Compute the user?s interest degree to every application category in a day;  Step 4: Form and output the matrix of the user?s interest matrix;  Step 5: Get   an   individual   user?s   interests   on   every category of application.



IV. PERSERNALIZED APPLICATION RECOMMEDNDATION ENGINE  A. The process of personalized application recommendation  The process of personalized application recommendation includes these steps as below: 1. Collect users? information, classify users? actions and label these actions with different weights.  Settle and sort out the user data automatically. 2.

Analyze the user data. Find out users? interests hidden in those user data according to some specific statistic methods. Group all users into some classes based on the interests which have been mined. 3. Observe and analyze each user?s behavior in every group. Find out association states in these groups.  Then obtain some valuable association rules. 4. Regulate those weights according to the change of users and their behavior.

Reflect the change of user?s interest. And get the increase or decrease of user?s interests in some kinds of application.

Figure.2 shows the process of personalized application recommendation engine.

B. A k -center clustering algorithm  k -center clustering algorithm is a developed algorithm for clustering analysis. In personalized application  recommendation system described in this paper, k -center clustering algorithm is used for two reasons. One is this algorithm cannot be limited by some different attributions. The other is the algorithm has little sensitivity to isolated point because the algorithm choose some main points in the cluster as the center points  The description of the algorithm  Input: all users? interest models, the number of K which is the number of the expected clusters.

Output: k clusters which can make the total deflection between all points and their pertinent center point.

The algorithm:  1)   Choose k objects as the initial centre points jO  2)   Repeat  3)   For each object, compute the distance from those centre points, and find out the right center from which the distance to the object is the shortest. And distribute the object into the corresponding cluster;  4) Choose other points Orandom (except center point) randomly;  5)  Compute the total cost S ; compute the new costs jS  after replace jO by Orandom  6)  If S < jS , replace jO by Orandom, form new k clusters  whose center points are new;  7)  Until the center points do not change any more;  Figure 2. the model of personalized application recommendation engine  In this paper, select the number of the class of application  provided by the system as K .

Select the object whose interest value in respective class of application is maximal as an initial centre point. According to the approach, find out all needed points. If more than two objects meet the condition, select one randomly.  If an object whose interest value in a group of application is maximal has been selected as centre point for another cluster, select the object whose interest value is the second maximal.  Use this method until find out the right object.

?  = =    N  k  DjkS N  = the number of the users in a cluster  ?= 2intint )( resetreset kjDjk means the distance between interest values of two users j and k .

C. Personalized recommendation based on clustering  The idea of personalized recommendation based on clustering is to recommend some value application to an individual in term of other users? behavior that belongs to the same cluster with the target user.  As far as a user who use the system firstly, the system do not actively recommend application to him or her because his or her interest values can hardly be computed due to shortage of necessary data.

The process of personalized recommendation based on clustering can be described as below:  For an individual userU :  1)  Find the cluster K to which U belongs to  2) Analyze the log that is about other users? using the system.  Respectively count the total number of all different application which has been downloaded by these users.

3)  Descending sort the numbers mentioned in step 2)  4)  Recommend application which is the top on the sort table got in step 3);  D. Personalized recommendation based on association rules  Using some statistic technologies, useful user?s behavior data can be obtained after the initial records are pretreated. In this paper, user?s behavior data mean some structural data which include the number of application items which a user downloaded in a period and the sequence of these items. Some association rules which will be described as below can be mined from these user?s behavior data.

1) In all users who downloaded application item Appa1, there are? percent of these users who downloaded application item Appc1;     2) In all users who downloaded application item Appa2,  Appa2, Appa3, Appa4, and Appa5, there are ? percent of these users who downloaded application item Appc2;  3) In all users who downloaded application item Appa6  firstly, there are ? percent of these users who downloaded application item Appc3 secondly;  In these rules mentioned above, Appai (i=1,2,3,4,5,6) are known as formers of association rules and Appcj (j=1,2,3) are  called consequences, ? %, ? %and? % are called confidence of the rules. These rules can be described as below.

1) Appa1 ? Appc1, confidence = ? %; in this system discussed in the paper, the threshold of ?  is set as 75 because of experiential reference;  2)  Appa2 Appa3 Appa4 Appa5 ?  Appc2, confidence = ? %; the threshold of ? is set as 50, the deep of the former of this rule is 3;  3)  Appa6 ?  Appc3, confidence =? %; the threshold of  ? is set as 60;  E. The process of personal recommendation based on  association rules  1)  Between 1:00 and 14:30 every weekend, mine association rules. The logs are limited in the latest week;  2) Delete the data of users whose application items  downloaded are less than three in a day  3) According to the analysis of the logs, find out the rules which is match one of the regulations mentioned above;  4) According   to   the   rules,   actively   recommend application item which is the later of one rule to users whose behavior match the former of the same rule.

F. The recommendation decision based on combining association rules and clustering  Personalized application recommendation system in the OTA system described in this paper uses association rules technology and clustering technology respectively, and some association rules and groups of users can be mined from users? behavior data. When a user?s current behavior matches one or several association rules, the system recommend pertinent application items as these rules firstly. Otherwise, the system searches the relative group which the user belongs to, and recommends application items according to other activities of users who are in the same group.



V. EXPERIMENTS  Using the method, algorithm and thinking described above, a detailed personalized application recommendation system in the OTA system is implemented. 500 users? log files are selected from August 6th 2007 to September 24th 2007. After analyzing these users? data about using the system, a matrix about these users? interests to each application class is obtained.

Clustering algorithm causes these 500 users to be divided into  7 groups and association rules. 6 association rules are mined from these log files. Then some application items are recommended to these users respectively. These users evaluate these application items by giving values from 0-5.0 means the user is not interested in this application item totally. 5 means the user is very interceded in this item. So the result of this experience can be described as blow:  TABLE I. THE RESULT OF EXPERIMENT(I)  Name of class Number  of users  Number  of items  The mean of scores  from users? evaluation  Finance 110 110 4.27  Trade 120 120 4.25  News 50 50 3.40  Individual  affairs 100 100 4.20  Entertainments 120 120 4.25  TABLE II. THE RESULT OF EXPERIMENT(II)  Name of class  Number of  associaton  rules mined  Number of  items based  on the  association  rules  The mean of  scores from  users? evaluation  Finance 2 220 4.50  Trade 0 0  News 3 360 4.66  Individual  affairs  Entertainments 1 70 4.60  From the result, we can draw a conclusion that the effects of recommendation on finance, trade, individual affairs and entertainments are better than that on news. The reason should be the data on news are not enough and there is not any attractive news during the days on which the experiments are carried out.

The method to recommend application items used in the system is simple. The system only chooses the application class in which the user is the most interested, which can exert some negative influence on the improvement of users? satisfaction.

The association rules are mined in three classes that are finance, news and entertainments. Therefore, only 6 rules are mined. But the users? evaluation to the recommendation is very exciting.

Comparing the recommendation based on clustering with that based on association rules, we can conclude that the recommendation based on clustering has better effects but the number of the fields in which valuable rules can be mined is limited. On the other hand, the recommendation based on clustering can recommend application items to each user, but to some extents, the effects of recommendation are unsatisfying.
