Semantic Levels of Information Hierarchy for   Urban Street Navigation

Abstract? Urban street areas are highly populated with buildings and its related information. Therefore, a suitable data representation scheme is essential to provide urban navigators with useful and relevant data semantics for better understanding of the surrounding space. The aim of this paper is to propose a design methodology of a spatial semantic database which is semantically enriched for providing information at different level of detail (LOD) using a hierarchical data structure. Preliminary tests of the proposed semantic DB schema and its data structure design applied on a set of real street building data and its evaluations reveal the feasibility of our approach to be extended to large scale mobile applications.

I. INTRODUCTION Urban street environment is highly populated with 3D  building information. The data quantity is very huge to be represented in any data representation schemes. Even if such a representation is possible, the extend of its utilization and management in various applications including navigation systems, driving simulators, urban data management, air pollution detection, traffic analysis, disaster management and so on is highly tedious and complex task. Considering a City as an enlarged aggregation of big data units which can be decomposed into numerous meaningful objects, each such entity can be represented semantically [1] and its relationships can be expressed as a hierarchical data structure. This idea can be utilized in urban navigation applications, where the main purpose of the user is to find the destination buildings of his interest or intension. In such a scenario, providing the entire street area data to the user is not meaningful as he has to do a lot of cognitive interpretations by himself and as a result he may sometimes lose his point of interest (POI) of his destination building. Lesser the detailed content , more is the usability, interactivity and easiness to find a building in a street [2]. Based on this idea, we propose a design methodology for filtering out unnecessary information from the scene and emphasizing important areas in the street data. Thus in the design methodology we represent the entire city information hierarchically as structural semantics using different level of details for both geometry and texture. This structural hierarchy  is then semantically mapped to user specific functional semantics. We represent the building model as a RDF schema based on building ontology and its relationships with other building parts. The buildings are then grouped as functional clusters depending on the service each building provides to the user. The approach helps to prioritize buildings depending on the functional clusters and associate them with the user intension in real time.

This paper is organized as follows. Section I provides a general introduction of the topic. Section II describes the related research. Section III focuses more on the semantic data structure definition. Section IV shows the DB Schema of our building model. Section V is the experimental results and evaluation. Section VI gives some concluding remarks.



II. RELATED WORK Research related to the new representation scheme for  urban street navigation has become increasingly important in the last few years. A number of different standards and hierarchical classification of the 3D city have been developed for this purpose [3]. Different visualization taxonomies, classifications and terminologies are described by Gao et al. in the paper [4]. The paper describes how to use the ontology in the portal for discovery visualization services. One purpose of the Top Level Visualization Ontology is to provide a common vocabulary to describe visualization data, processes, and products[5]. This paper aims to describe some modifications for the visualization ontology which can lead to a better representation of the visualization process and data models. [6] investigated what are the components of such an ontology and how to derive relationships from a given ontology. Such an ontology will facilitate sharing of the process models (pipelines) between visualization developers and collaboration and interaction among users. M. Voigt et al. [7] systematically surveyed the broad corpus of visualization literature and discussed existing concepts and found the difference between continuous and discrete ontology representation. CityGML[8, 9, 10] is another data model for representing the geometrical, topological, semantic and appearance aspects of 3D city models. CityGML represents buildings and building parts using different level of details (LOD).

IV. DB SCHEMA The DB Schema [13] is a structural data representation  described in a formal language that supports the database management system (DBMS) and refers to the organization of data as a blueprint of how a database is constructed. The formal definition of database schema is a set of formulas (sentences) called integrity constraints imposed on a database. These integrity constraints ensure compatibility between parts of the schema. All constraints are expressible in the same language. A database can be considered a structure in realization of the database language [14]. The states of a created conceptual schema are transformed into an explicit mapping to the database schema. This describes how real world entities are modeled in the database.

The modeling principle of our DB schema is based on feature taxonomy and decomposition of city into smaller components considering both the semantic and spatial aspects. The key idea is to provide a common data definition of the basic features, attributes and relations in the form of  ontology for 3D building models with respect to geometric, appearance, topological and semantic properties. Buildings may be an aggregation of building parts, which allows the separation of different parts of large buildings. The class Building include information about building class, function, usage, roof type, height (as well as individual heights for each of the building floors). Both classes may also reference one or more addresses. According to the CityGML encoding standard [11], building complexes such as airports or hospitals should be aggregated into CityObjectGroups. The different buildings in the group may then be given individual attributes such as ?Main Building?. The representation and the semantic structure of buildings are refined from LOD1 to LOD4. There are five different Levels of Detail (LODs) in the CityGML encoding standard. The different LODs allow for a more detailed view and a low-poly representation of city models. A CityGML file may include several models of the very same building but in different Levels of Detail, which is useful when different parts of the dataset have different sources and accuracy. Our building model consists     of Name, Address, Parking availability, surface information, billboards installation, public toilet facility, number of entrances, floor details and so on. The floor details can be classified as main entrance details, elevator availability details, public toilet and the functional ratio of stores. The surface information can be of color appearance or material appearance details. Transportation facilities can also be included as a important information regarding the building, i.e the distance to the nearest subway or bus stop. The building model specifies the details of the data types of each category and the manner in which they need to be stored in the data base. The Figure 3  shows the UML diagram of the building DB Schema. The RDF Schema defining the building domain is shown in Figure 4. Association of the metadata to the building model permits for the semantic annotation of the 3D environment. Such an association helps to add high level information that describes the properties of building parts and their relationship between them.

V.          EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS In the previous sections, we explained the data structure and DB schema used to represent building and its different parts in multiple levels. We will now briefly verify our results using some simulation results and performance evaluations.

For the testing environment, we prepared a general desktop PC as a server and a laptop as a client. The laptop contains I7 core CPU, 4GB RAM and NVIDIA GT 620 M GPU. The proposed system was tested and evaluated using a set of real street data of three hundred realistic buildings, which were located at Gangnam district in South Korea. We fixed a starting position and a destination position for the user who navigates in the 3D world. The proposed system dynamically changes levels of the viewed buildings according to their corresponding information levels. The  levels of detail were based on both the structural and texture hierarchy as explained in the Section III. In our current implementation we define two user contexts. One is when the user is moving and the other is when the user stops to explore the surrounding buildings to find his/her destination.

When user stops, the system provides with full detailed high level information of the buildings on the street. When the user starts moving his way, different non-photorealistic appearance of the buildings are rendered depending on the user gaze and his distance from the buildings position. The test results are shown in Figure 5.  We conducted two types of tests for performance evaluation. The first one is based on the rendering speed. In this test, each user tried twenty times of these process and we measured an average rendering speed of the proposed system. Table I describes the number of buildings, an average number of viewed buildings, an average size of a building, average download time per building and an average FPS value. As described in Table 1, the results showed a feasible rendering speed even though it is dependent on a scenario of navigation.  Secondly, we evaluate the running behavior of the system. Figure 6 shows the running behavior of the system with respect to the four system states Geometry busy, Shader busy, Texture busy and GPU busy. Figure 6 (a) shows the variations in the behavior of system when no semantic level of detail is applied (b) shows the variations in the behavior of the system when our proposed semantic level of detail hierarchy is applied.



VI.          CONCLUSION This paper proposes a new data representation  mechanism with application to the current street navigation scenarios. Also, this paper shows the importance of adopting a hierarchical data structure for representing multi-level information of complex street building information. This semantically enriched approach is based on ontology and its associated knowledge of representing the city model in different level of details. With this approach, the level of detail varies according to user intension and services in the geometric level. Since we are using an ontology based representation for the city model, adjacent structures and their relationships are derived easily and adapted automatically. As future work, we will refine our present semantic level of detail data structure to include more of user semantics and improve the implementation on the real data of street. Also we concentrate on streaming continuously the real data at different levels to the users of heterogeneous devices simultaneously using an extended server-client platform supporting various mobile devices in real time.
