Towards a Privacy-enhanced Social Networking Site

Abstract? Social Networking Sites (SNS), such as Facebook and LinkedIn, have become the established place for keeping contact with old friends and meeting new acquaintances. As a result, a user leaves a big trail of personal information about him and his friends on the SNS, sometimes even without being aware of it. This information can lead to privacy drifts such as damaging his reputation and credibility, security risks (for instance identity theft) and profiling risks. In this paper, we first highlight some privacy issues raised by the growing development of SNS and identify clearly three privacy risks.

While it may seem a priori that privacy and SNS are two antagonist concepts, we also identified some privacy criteria that SNS could fulfill in order to be more respectful of the privacy of their users. Finally, we introduce the concept of a Privacy-enhanced Social Networking Site (PSNS) and we describe Privacy Watch, our first implementation of a PSNS.

I. INTRODUCTION Beginning as a simple website that allowed users to  create profiles, list friends and browse through their friends list, Social Networking Sites (SNS) have developed rapidly as technology changes with new mobile dimensions and features. According to a report of Nielsen [1], web users in the United States have tripled the amount of time they spent on social networks in August 2009 compared to one year ago. Meanwhile, advertising on social networks rose to $108 million from $49 million in August of 2008, an increase of 119%.

With so many different activities available on SNS, the amount and variety of user data is especially great and diverse. However, the reputation of these SNS has been blackened by many incidents reported in news media and SNS users have reasons to be concerned about their privacy.

Although most of the current SNS provide some privacy tools including privacy settings and the ability to block users and to report spam, they are not flexible enough to protect users against privacy risks. Moreover, even if SNS users can control the access to their own profile, they cannot control what others reveal about them. Thus, it is possible for information to be passed on without one?s consent. For instance, a friend could be untrustworthy and steal a user?s photo or video. Another problem is that SNS providers have unlimited access to users? data. With this enormous amount  of information, there are many commercial opportunities for businesses on SNS. Marketers who target specific kind of consumers can use stated, personal information gathered from SNS for purposes other than what users originally intend.

In order to protect themselves, SNS users should be conscious about the danger of divulging their information and the security risks awaiting them within SNS. To raise users? privacy awareness, in this paper we redefine the concept of privacy within SNS as well as review different type of privacy risks and privacy incidents in SNS. However, to battle against the loss of privacy on SNS, we think that the SNS provider should also shoulder the responsibilities. In particular, there is a strong need for a privacy-enhanced environment for the users, thus we introduce the concept of a Privacy-enhanced Social Networking Site (PSNS).

The outline of the paper is the following: Section 2 defines SNS and the notion of privacy relative to them. In Section 3, we discuss various types of privacy risks in SNS illustrate by some examples. Finally, we have identified some privacy criteria to remediate (at least partially) to these privacy risks and introduce the concept of a Privacy- enhanced SNS in Section 4 before concluding in Section 5.



II. BACKGROUND  A. Definition of Social Networking Sites The term ?social networking sites? comes from ?social  network?, which represents relationships and flows between people, groups, organizations, animals, computers or other information/knowledge processing entities [2]. Generally speaking, an SNS is a website that provides a virtual community for people interested in a particular subject or just to ?hang out? together [3]. Boyd and Ellison [4] provide a more formal definition of SNS which says that they are ?web-based services that allow individuals to (1) construct a public or semi-public profile within a bounded system, (2) articulate a list of other users with whom they share a connection, and (3) view and traverse their list of connections and those made by others within the system?.

However, this definition falls short of describing newly emerging SNS such as Twitter or resource-sharing websites with social networking components such as Youtube and Picasa. Moreover, it does not deal with the privacy issues  Esma A?meur1, S?bastien Gambs2, Ai Ho1 1D?partement d?Informatique et de Recherche Op?rationnelle (DIRO), Universit? de Montr?al  {aimeur,hothitha@iro.umontreal.ca} 2IRISA, INRIA / Universit? de Rennes 1  {sebastien.gambs@irisa.fr}   DOI 10.1109/ARES.2010.97     that appear in an online community. Thus, we give a broader definition of SNS as websites that allow users to: - connect with other users by befriending (Facebook),  following (Twitter), subscribing (Youtube), ...

- interact with content posted by other users, for example  by commenting, replying or rating, - restrict their own content to authorized users only.

B. Privacy Enhancing Technologies Privacy is a fundamental right of each individual (see for  instance the Article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the Assembly of United Nations, 1948) but is also a notion difficult to define and formalize, which can take different flavours depending on the context. Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) are generally designed to respect two important principles:  -The data minimization principle states that only the information necessary to complete a particular application should be disclosed (and no more). This principle is a direct application of the legitimacy criteria defined by the European data protection directive (Article 7, [5]).

- The data sovereignty principle states that the data related to an individual belongs to him and that he should stay in control of how these data are used and for which purpose.

The fact that most of the current SNS does not respect the data minimization and the data sovereignty principles is not a fundamental impossibility result but rather a design choice made by the SNS providers. In the rest of this paper, we will identify more precisely the different privacy risks related to the use of SNS, the different privacy criteria that SNS can implement in order to increase the protection of the privacy of their users as well as ongoing work related to the development of the Privacy-enhanced Social Networking Site (PSNS).



III. PRIVACY RISKS IN SNS Chatting, blogging, commenting, posting photos and  spending time on SNS like Facebook and Myspace have become part of everyday life for millions of internet users.

However as a consequence, SNS users expose themselves to different privacy risks that we review in the following sections.

A.  Security Risks Due to the large amount of personal information  circulating in SNS, users may be exposed to online attacks, including identity theft, phishing, scam, predator and other cybercrime. For instance, according to Symantec?s Internet Security Threat Report on April 2008 [6], SNS have become the next top targets for identity theft. Identity theft occurs when someone uses your personal information without your knowledge or consent to commit a crime, such as fraud or theft. Currently with the default privacy settings of most SNS which set all the user data to be available to everyone, a cybercriminal could easily obtain information about a user?s  home, hobbies, interests and friends, and then impersonate a trusted friend or convince him that he has the authority to request more personal or financial data. The wave of spear phishing in SNS began in 2007 [7], in which phishers use personal information that users have posted on SNS to try to steal their financial information. They also hack SNS accounts of famous people then use them to lure their fan. In 2007, when MySpace users click on the hacked accounts of Alicia Keys, a famous singer, they would be linked to other sites tricking them into buying fake anti-virus software.

Applications due to third parties also pose themselves as a great security risk. For instance, millions of users play games on Facebook, some of which require users to buy credit or invite as many friends as possible. By adding strangers as friend, providing credit card number or cell phone number, the userw risk to be the victim of identity theft, phishing or to have their reputation damaged if the application diverts from its claimed purpose.

Teenagers (especially young ones) are the most vulnerable age group for online attacks. They are also at high risk of being approached by online predators or becoming victims of cyber bullying. Online predators try to gradually seduce their targets through attention, affection, kindness, and even online gifts, and often devote considerable time, money, and energy to this effort. These kinds of information can be found easily by observing news feeds, the user status or blogs. In 2006, Elvin Chaung, an alleged cyber-sicko, used his Facebook account to "case" female students, watching their pages to find out who their friends were and whatever he could find about their backgrounds. He succeeded in getting over 50 women to send him nude photos and videos [8]. Investigators believe he tried the scam on hundreds of college students around the country.

B.  Reputation and Credibility Risks Reputation is the social evaluation of the public towards  a person, a group of persons or an organization. It is an important factor in many fields such as business, online communities or social status [9]. With the blooming of SNS, users? online reputation has extended beyond Internet. If user?s reputation is damaged, it can also affect his credibility in real life. As more and more people turn to SNS to chronicle their lives and socialize with friends, they are also learning that their words and pictures are reaching way beyond the circle of friends for whom they were intended [10]. In October 2007, several officers from the Canada Border Services Agency who work in British Columbia were accused of posting inappropriate and offensive material, some of it directly related to their jobs, on Facebook [11].

The posted material includes jokes about guns and passports, an allegation that Prime Minister Stephen Harper is a ?serial killer? and insults directed at French-speaking Canadians.

This information was intended as a joke, but the authority did not think so because it has jeopardized the agency's reputation.

In addition, more and more employers are utilizing SNS to screen potential employees. In a recent survey of CareerBuilder [12], 45% of employers reported that they use SNS to research job candidates, a big increase from 22% last year. As a result, users of SNS may lose job opportunities due to the inappropriate information put on their profile. A teacher in Madison (Wisconsin) was recently suspended after pictures of her with weapons appeared on her Facebook profile [13]. Since the beginnings of SNS, companies have turned to them to determine whether there is something about applicants? lifestyle that would go against the core values of their corporation. Moreover, users not only have to worry about their own profiles but also the profiles of their Friends [14]. For instance even when a user profile is kept clean and professional, it may not really matter if their Friends swear, use drugs, get drunk and put all these things with vivid details with a link to the user profile.

Moreover, SNS affects not only the reputation of the employees but also can cause trouble to the employers. One of the first things many laid-off workers have been doing during this recession is to update their profiles on LinkedIn [15]. One of its features is ?Get recommended? where the workers can click an online button and ?Have colleagues, clients, teachers, and partners speak up for you.? However, if someone has been dismissed because of poor performance, and a manager has given him a positive recommendation, the credibility of the company will be questioned.

C. Profiling Risks Profiling is ?the recording and classification of  behaviours? as defined by the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC). It has become an entire industry called Customer Relations Management (CRM) or Personalization.

Companies collect information from a number of resources, especially SNS, to build comprehensive profiles on individuals in order to sell products and dossiers on behaviour. This is often performed without the person?s explicit consent or even without leaving the chance for him to opt-out of the dossier building process.

In order to maintain services, SNS providers have to struggle to earn money by advertising. In a recent report of comScore [16], personal SNS such as MySpace, Hi5, Bebo, Classmates, etc. accounted for more than 20% of all display ads viewed online in United States, with MySpace and Facebook combined together delivering more than 80% of ads. These statistics show that marketers are eager to use fast-growing networks to advertise their products. An Australian online-marketing company, uSocial, can help them to find potential customer. After trawling Facebook for users by searching for criteria such as age, location and interests, uSocial recommends potential customers to companies, who then approach them directly. A firm pays 727$ for each 5,000 users who agree to be its friend (or 15 cents per friend). ?Fans?, who merely express support for a firm, are cheaper [17]. Facebook also offers a type of advertising that allows companies to target potential  customers by letting users click on an advert to become that company?s fan. As a result, some SNS have really become a network of advertising rather than friendship.

Although collecting publicly available data is not illegal, SNS users do not have control on how this information will be exploited. For instance, it might be used by marketers for targeted advertising or sold to governments for law enforcement purposes. The collected data may affect user?s welfare in the future as these profiles contain a great amount of personal information such as Social Insurance Number, shopping preferences, health information, household income, lifestyle preferences just to name a few. For example, if Bob boasts his fast driving attitude on an SNS, the car insurance company can classify him as a ?high risk? customer resulting in a higher insurance rate even if he was never involved in an accident.

These privacy risks are much more noticeable in SNS than personal website and blogs because SNS provide a sense of intimacy created by our community of online friends. With the motivation to communicate and maintain relationships, the amount of information revealed willingly by the user is much greater than on other media. Moreover, SNS make it extremely easy to upload many different forms of personal information, such as age, contact information (including home address and telephone numbers), photos, sexual orientation, and music preferences. According to a 2007 survey [18], 91% of Facebook participants and 62% of MySpace participants use their real name to identify themselves and 85% of the respondents either currently share or would share pictures of themselves on the aforementioned sites.



IV. PRIVACY CRITERIA FOR SNS In this section, we propose a taxonomy of privacy criteria  that can be used to evaluate how well as particular SNS integrates privacy features into its design. Privacy criteria for SNS that we have identified include:  - Customization of access control by group of users and types of information. A user generally possesses different circles of acquaintances ranging from close friends to family members and colleagues from work. If the SNS gives to the user the possibility to group his friends by categories of users, then it is possible via a simple access control mechanism to restrict which type of information can be access by each group of users. At first glance, this seems to be a simple privacy solution, however, only some SNS are currently implementing it. For instance Facebook, the world largest SNS with 300 million active monthly users from around the globe [19], provides elaborate privacy settings, breaking user profile into several small elements (Basic Info, Personal Info, Wall Post, Friends?). For each element, users have the option to specify who can see their information and who cannot. However, according to an experiment made by Iyer [20] and verified by us in September 2009, these privacy settings are not working as expected and have some bugs, especially when a user tries to block a specific ?friend? from     accessing a specific personal information. The situation is even worse in other personal SNS such as MySpace or Bebo, in which the users can only choose to make their whole profile public (accessible to everyone) or private (accessible to all their friends). This lack of reliable access control can lead to serious privacy risks such as security or reputation and credibility.

- User-friendly way of setting privacy. Besides being flexible and expressive, the customization of the privacy settings of the user should be done within an interface integrated in the SNS that is both user-friendly and easy to grasp for a typical user. Facebook is one of the few SNS that provide detailed privacy settings. However, the current Facebook privacy interface is so complex that only those who are very motivated will exert the effort to adjust their settings [21].

- Explicit privacy policy from the SNS. For the user to be aware of the privacy risks incurred by putting personal information on the SNS, a first step is for the SNS to state explicitly how it will use this information by expressing it as a privacy policy. This privacy policy should be easily comprehensible by the user, which means it should be expressed in terms that are easy to understand and not convoluted. All of the SNS have a privacy policy and many use it to emphasize the importance of user privacy to the company. However, only 10% of users claim to have read the privacy policy of their SNS [22]. One of the possible reasons is that the policy is too long, the mean length being 2,633 words, with a median of 2,245 [23]. A possible alternative to solve this situation is to offer an easy way for the user to express his desiderata in terms of a privacy policy and then to have a mechanism that can verify automatically if the privacy preferences of the users are compatible with the privacy policy of the SNS. If not, the user is warned and may decide whether or not he still wants to register to this SNS or to try another one more compliant with his desiderata for privacy.

- Explicit privacy policy from applications. Applications should also display a privacy policy stating (1) which information of the user they want to access and (2) how they will use it. If the user estimates that a particular application asks for too much information compared to its claimed purpose, he may decide consciously not to accept this application. Nowadays, most SNS applications only provide a shallow notification about which information they take from user profile (almost all user data) without any assurance about how they will use it. For example, if the user wants to install the application Black Jack in Bebo, he has to allow this application to identify him and access his profile (without knowing what kind of information will really be taken).

- Ownership of the data (SNS or user).  According to the principle of data sovereignty (as defined in Section 2), the information of the user is considered as being his property and not belonging to the SNS upon whose server it is stored.

Most of the current SNS (such as Facebook and LinkedIn)  do not respect this principle and rather consider that all the information that the user puts on their website belongs to them. As a consequence they feel free to use this information as they wish, for instance by selling it to other companies or using it in advertisement campaign. In a privacy-enhanced SNS, the data should be considered as being the property of the user and not the property of the SNS which stores it temporary with the consent of the user. FaceCloak [24], a Firefox browser extension, attempts to solve this problem by providing fake information to the SNS and by storing sensitive information in encrypted form on a separate server.

However, this application does not allow users to customize access control for each group of friends. In addition, if the SNS detects that the users? information (i.e. birthdates, email address) is fake, it could easily suspend their account.

- No data retention if the user leaves the SNS. A specific case regarding the ownership of the data concerns the situation where the user wants to leave the SNS and to delete his account. When this situation occurs, the SNS should respect the right of the user to oblivion and completely remove his information from its records (not even keeping a copy for the unlikely situation where the user might comes back later). However, most SNS do not specify their retention policy and it is not clear how user profiles will be processed after the user has left.

- Privacy lens. The best way for a user to realize which information about him can leak is to make him see how his profile will appear in the eyes of other users. This is the main idea behind the privacy lens and can improve the privacy awareness of the user. Some SNS are already providing this feature such as LinkedIn (?View My Public Profile as others see it?) and Facebook (?View as? mode).

- Customized search. If a user can specify to the SNS who can search his profile or which information should be available for the search process, this will enhance the preservation of his privacy. For instance, a user might want to be totally invisible for persons which are not part of his list of friends thus ensuring the property of unobservability (not being able to detect if a particular user is registered to the SNS or not). The user could also state which of his personal information are sensitive relative to the search process and which are not. For example, the user can consider that it is ok if another user finds his name when searching for a sport practiced by him but not for something such as his religion which is deemed more sensible.

- Active blocking of information related to user (i.e. tag removing). Complementary to the customization of which information can be searched regarding to his profile, a user should also have the possibility to remove the tags of objects that points to his profile. For instance, he may decide that some pictures are too sensible and remove the association between this picture and his profile. If not, then these pictures may appear when somebody searches for pictures associated to his identity.

- Tracking how user's information is disseminated. In our digital world where it is possible to copy the information as     much as desired, it is not easy to control how information is disseminated once it is out on Internet. It is possible however to imagine that by a combination of logs and techniques such as watermarking, the dissemination of information can be (at least partially) controlled and that in case of a privacy breach, it is possible to find which persons are potentially suspect because they have previously accessed this information.

- Report spam/abuse. The possibility of reporting bad behaviour or abuse of other users within the SNS makes it possible to detect users that divert it from its original goal, for instance by spamming other users for financial or malicious purposes.

- Reputation system. If the SNS manages some kind of reputation mechanism, it becomes more difficult for a newcomer within the SNS to perform privacy breaches without his reputation being affected. For instance, Orkut allows users to ?rate? their friends but this feature is only for fun without any real impact on friend reputation.



V. PRIVACY-ENHANCED SOCIAL NETWORKING SITE  A. Definition A Privacy-enhanced Social Networking Site (PSNS) can  be defined as a SNS that fulfils the following properties: -Privacy awareness and customization. A PSNS makes  the user aware of some of the potential risks of sharing information with other persons. In addition, it also gives an easy and flexible way for to the user to express his privacy concern in terms of a personal policy and to compare it with the privacy policies of other actors such as the SNS, applications or other users.

-Data minimization. The user can check which of his information is accessed by SNS services (SNS provider and third party application) and how this information is used. In particular, the SNS services have to state clearly which personal information of the user they need and how they will process it. The user can then make an enlightened decision on whether or not to accept the SNS services. The PSNS should have an in-built mechanism to control access to the information of the user and ensure that all SNS services cannot access more data than authorized.

-Data sovereignty. It should be state explicitly in the privacy policy of the SNS that the personal data of the user belongs to him and not to the SNS that stores it. For instance, the SNS should not use the personal data of the user without its explicit consent and should not be able to sell it to other entities. Moreover, if the user decides to quit the SNS, this  one should explicitly delete all the information stored regarding the user (and not even keep a copy for the uncertain case where the user might want to come back later). The user should also have the possibility to track how his information is disseminated (for instance which friends have seen which pictures) but also to control information related to him that have been posted by other users (such as tag on a picture that points to his profile).

B. Related Work To the best of our knowledge, there are only two  proposals of systems that try to integrate privacy tightly into the design of the SNS: HelloWord [25] and the Privacy Preserving SNS of Cutillo, Molva, and Strufe [26]. These two systems are based on the concept of decentralization and peer-to-peer techniques. As a result, these systems suffer from the common disadvantages of decentralized system: redundant resources and no centralized control (which in terms of privacy can of course be seen also as an advantage).

With these two systems, it becomes more difficult to search for friends and relatives. Moreover, the techniques proposed are intensive and suitable only for advanced users. Casual and normal users may possibly prefer a balance between privacy and ease of use. This is one of the motivation  behind Privacy Watch, our own privacy-enhanced SNS.

C. Privacy Framework for SNS Privacy Watch is based on the Privacy Framework for  SNS that we have proposed in a previous work [27]. In particular, we have defined four privacy levels (No Privacy, Soft Privacy, Hard Privacy, Full Privacy) and introduced the concept of User Privacy Policy (UPP). This framework provides users with an easy and flexible way to specify and communicate their privacy concerns to other users, third parties and SNS service provider. In our system, the user can choose to which extend he trust the SNS provider. In particular based on his privacy level, the user will determine how much information he would like to share with the provider. For example, in the situation where the user chooses Full Privacy, the SNS server is only trusted in storing an encrypted version of the personal information of the user so that it can consult at any time by one of his friends but not to the point where the SNS itself has access to this information (as the SNS server does not know the keys needed to decrypt this information). As the purpose of Privacy Watch is to protect the user privacy, the privacy level is set by default to Full Privacy (see Table 1).

TABLE I.  DEFAULT PRIVACY SETTINGS IN PRIVACY WATCH  No Privacy Soft Privacy Hard Privacy Full Privacy (default) Default Privacy Settings - Healthy - Harmless - Harmful - Poisonous Default Friend groups - Best friend - Normal friend - Acquaintance - Visitor Trust in SNS Provider - Best friend  - Do not encrypt data - Normal friend - Encrypt Poisonous data  - Acquaintance - Encrypt Harmful and Poisonous data  - Visitor - Encrypt all data before uploading  Access control - Server side - Server side - Client side - Client side       D. Privacy Watch Figure 1 presents the overview of Privacy Watch.

Contrary to HelloWorld, Privacy Watch is based on the traditional client-server paradigm where a central system (the SNS server) is being responsible for storing the personal information of the user (but possibly encrypted). The users of Privacy Watch have a Client Privacy Manager (CPM) that resided on their computer (for instance as a Firefox or Safari plug-in) which has the responsibility of helping them to maintain their data sovereignty of their personal information.

Privacy Watch also relies on an auxiliary third party such as independent mail server to store and exchange privacy policies and encryption keys with the contacts and friends of a user. This is a form of protection of privacy through the splitting of information between two entities (the SNS server and the email provider), it is therefore very important that these two entities are really independent and non-colluding.

1) Architecture The architecture of Privacy Watch is composed of the  following components: - SNS Server Database. This module stores the encrypted  data sent by the CPM, normal data (unencrypted) as well as user privacy preferences (such as possibly the UPP of the user and his groups of friends).

- SNS Services. This module includes all social services provided by the SNS such as Friends, Blog, Profile, RSS, Tagging, Photo or Music.

- Server Access Controller. The purpose of this module is to control all data access according to the UPP of the user and to manage possible UPP violations. It also manages the access control mechanisms to the personal information of the user for his friends. Therefore in a sense it acts as a proxy  sitting between the personal information of the user and his friends.

- Mail Server. This module is a third party email server such as Hotmail and Gmail that is assumed to be independent from the SNS. It is used to store and exchange keys (for instance encryption/decryption keys) as well as UPP between users (in case where the user does not trust the SNS for doing so).

- Privacy Advisor. This module recommends suitable privacy level adapted to users. The privacy level of a particular user is elicited by a question-response protocol between Privacy Advisor and the user that is both easy to understand and flexible. The Privacy Advisor also helps to warn users about potential risks in SNS as well as guides them to create their UPP. Another function of this module is give recommendation on new possible friends based on their reputation in the system.

- Encryption/ Decryption. As its name implies, this module is used to encrypt and decrypt data of users if necessary.

- Client Access Controller. When the user does not trust the SNS, this module will take the roles of Server Access Controller, monitoring access to user encrypted data.

- Key Manager. This module is responsible for creating keys used for encryption/ decryption, as well as managing the group signature scheme used to control the access to his profile on the SNS server.

In Privacy Watch, we separate the encryption of the data, which is done using a symmetric cipher with a cipher key, and the access control mechanism to the profile of the user which is based on a group signature scheme (members of different groups of friends of a user have different group key).

Figure 1.  Overview of Privacy Watch     For each of his group of friends, a user generates a (public) verification key that will be transmitted to the SNS server whereas the private signature keys will be transmitted by email to the members of the group (one different for each friend of the group). A friend of the user can used his private signature key to sign messages (such as random messages) on behalf of the group but without having to reveal his exact identity, thus proving to the SNS server his membership. The SNS server can then use the verification key of the group to check the validity of the signature. As some group signature schemes include the possibility of revoking locally a particular private signature key, the user still has the possibility of removing a particular friend of a group by revoking his key in cooperation with the SNS server.

2) Scenario When Alice registers to the SNS, she downloads and  installs her Client Privacy Manager (CPM) as a browser plug-in. Based on the recommendation of the Privacy Advisor, Alice chooses her level of Privacy (Full, Hard, Soft or No Privacy) and specifies her UPP. For example, as Alice is ?privacy-addicted? she chooses Full Privacy.

The Key Manager in the CPM creates an account for Alice on the Mail Server that will be used for key sharing. It then creates different keys (KPS) for encrypting many attributes of her profile as well as verification/private signature keys for each group of Friends. For each attribute (Name, Birth day, Address, Photo album...) in her profile, Alice states the privacy settings of the attribute (Poisonous: default, Harmful, Harmless, Healthy) using the Interface module. For example, if a photo album is considered to be ?harmless?, the Encryption/Decryption Module uses the KPS_Harmless to encrypt it and then sends it to the SNS.

Alice can now use the SNS to connect with friends and choose to befriend Bob. The Privacy Advisor proposes to Alice four possible Friend Groups (Best friend, Normal friend, Casual friend, Visitor: default). For example, Alice classifies Bob as Normal friend. The Client Access Controller in Privacy Watch knows the UPP that Alice has specified for this particular friend group and emails this UPP to Bob. In order to befriend Alice, Bob has to accept this UPP. Bob?s Access Controller now stores Alice?s UPP. Key Manager uses email to send Bob his private signature key KNormal_friend,Bob as well as all KPS of the attributes that he is allowed to see as a normal friend of Alice.

Every time Bob logins to the SNS through his CPM, his Key Manager automatically checks his email account in order to update keys to the key database. According to the Full Privacy, normal friend can only see harmless data.

Based on the rules defined in Access Controller and Key Manager, the Interface module only displays harmless data to Bob. Afterwards, Bob clicks on Alice?s photo album A1.

The CPM of Bob uses the key Knormal_friend,Bob in order to prove to the SNS server that he belongs to the group Normal Friends of Alice (by signing a random challenge in behalf of the group). Bob can then download A1encrypted (the encrypted version of Alice?s pictures) and then the Encryption/  Decryption Module will use the appropriate KPS_Harmless to decrypt the pictures and the Interface module will display them to Bob. All this procedure is performed by the CPM of Bob which is directly integrated as a plug-in in his browser.



VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have first discussed the different  privacy issues raised by the current SNS as well the privacy risks that a user incurs while putting personal information on these SNS. These three main privacy risks are Security, Credibility and Reputation and finally Profiling. While SNS and privacy may seem a priori to have two opposite goals, we think that the fact that most of the current SNS does not respect the data minimization and the data sovereignty principles is not a fundamental impossibility result, but rather a design choice made by the SNS providers. Therefore in order to reconcile them, we have identified the different features that an SNS can integrate into its design to enhance the privacy of its users and we have introduced the concept of a Privacy-enhanced Social Networking Site (PSNS).

A PSNS is a social networking site that fulfils the properties of privacy awareness and customization, data minimization and data sovereignty. We have also described Privacy Watch, our proposed implementation for a PSNS.

Regarding the privacy criteria that we have defined in Section IV, Privacy Watch currently fullfills most of them except a few that we plan to implement as future works such as the report spam/abuse mechanism and the reputation system.

The most difficult part remains how to enforce in practice the privacy policies stated by the different actors of the SNS (such as SNS provider, applications and other users).  Indeed it is very easy for an actor to state a particular privacy policy, but in reality nothing really forces him to respect it once he has been able to access this information. For instance, a friend might do a copy of a particular sensitive picture of the user without his consent. However, by combining watermarking methods with logs for access control, it is possible to design a system that can partially monitor the dissemination of information regarding the user. Moreover, we are also currently studying how to use cryptographic techniques in order to implement a mechanism where in the case of the disclose of unauthorized information, the data owner will be able to prove to a third party (such as a legal authority) that is privacy has been damaged by another party.
