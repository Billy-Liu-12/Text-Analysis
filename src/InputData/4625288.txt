Associative Classifiers for Predictive analytics: Comparative Performance  Study

Abstract   A new predictive modelling approach known as associative classification, integrating association mining and classification into single system is being discussed as a better alternative for predictive analytics. Our paper investigates the performance issues of significant associative classifiers likes CMAR and CPAR. Performance comparisons observe that CPAR achieves improved performance as compared to CMAR. We have proposed the modification in these approaches by incorporating temporal dimension. The new approach was compared with their non-temporal counterparts and the results were analyzed for classifier accuracy and execution time. The study concludes that temporal CPAR achieves better performance than temporal CBA and temporal CMAR. The three temporal associative classifiers (TACs) were compared on ten different datasets for classifier accuracy and significant conclusion was drawn as temporal associative classifiers performed better than their non-temporal counterparts, while temporal CPAR being the best among the three TACs.

1. Introduction   The process of predictive analytics learns from the organization's collective experience, analyses the data with appropriate data mining techniques and keep the results in presentable form. In recent years data mining researchers have developed efficient Association Rule algorithms like Apriori and FP Growth (Frequent Pattern) for retail market basket analysis, but for some applications it is  more desirable to have predictive approach of classification rather than descriptive one likes association rule mining.

The objective in classification is to build a model in which it maps the objects into a predefined classes based on the attribute objects. It aims to discover a  small set of rules to form an accurate classifier for predictive mechanism. There are handful techniques for classification. Classification by decision tree was well researched and plenty of algorithms have been designed, a comprehensive survey on decision tree induction was done by some researchers [15].

Bayesian classification is another technique extensively discussed and improved by some researchers [8] where as some significant researches were done for pattern classification [12]. Nearest neighbor methods are also discussed in many statistical texts on classification [6] [12]. Many other Machine Learning and Neural Network techniques are utilized to construct the class.

While classification touted as predictive approach whereas association rule mining is known as the descriptive one. Association rule mining finds all rules in the database that satisfies some minimum support and minimum confidence constraints [11].

However, it has been observed that association rules could be used to model relationships between class labels and features from a training set [1]. Therefore, a new predictive modeling approach known as associative-classification integrating association mining and classification into a single system [1] [3][4] [16] [17] are being explored by the researches.

In this approach association rules were used to efficiently build a classification model from very large training datasets. In associative-classification the mapping is done through an association rule with the consequent restricted to the class attribute. Eager associative classification algorithms build a single rule set during the training phase, and this rule set is used to classify all test instances. Many of the existing associative-classification approaches use association rule mining algorithm, such as Apriori [1] [11] or FP-growth [16] [17], to generate the complete set of association rules. It selects a small set of high quality rules and uses this rule set for prediction.

Second UKSIM European Symposium on Computer Modeling and Simulation  DOI 10.1109/EMS.2008.29     2. Associative Classification Algorithms   Most of the classification models are directly built from traditional association rules in which the class appears in their right hand side. There is slight difference between classification and association rule discovery. Association rules do not involve prediction, they also do not provide to avoid over- fitting and under-fitting. Association rules are built from random set of association rules without using an ad-hoc minimum support threshold.

Many associative classifiers were proposed mainly differing in the strategies; they used to select rules for classification and also the heuristics used for pruning these rules. Some of the most significant ones are CBA [1], CMAR [16] and CPAR [17]. The experiment reports [1] [16] [17] show that associative-classification systems achieve competitive classification results with traditional classification approaches such as C4.5. In associative classification the mapping is done through an association rule with the consequent restricted to the class attribute.

Our predictive analytics proposes to incorporate domain information and past experience after the associative classification is done. This effort will yield to more understandable results in form of business rules rather than association rules or classification rules. As the end users of many associative classification approaches are business analyst the outcome of the proposed approach is likely to be more usable.

Figure 1. Predictive analytics with associative  classification   However, Associative Classification suffers from the deficiency and limitations often cited by the researchers as follows ? a) It often generates a very large number of  Association Rules in Association Rule Mining, which leads to high processing overhead.

b) It takes efforts to select high quality rules from among them.

c) Various Associative Classifiers treat the transactional data to be static one and does not incorporate their time varying behavior into mining process.

We have endeavored to identify some of these  issues and have conducted experiments various associative classification approaches on different datasets. Time is one of the important factors in real phenomenon, so we have incorporated the temporal dimension to our investigation for appropriate data mining technique for predictive analytics. This can be beneficial in planning the marketing strategy, as time- based predictions are more realistic   2.1 CPAR and CMAR: Association Rule Evaluation for Classification Purpose   CMAR [16] is a FP-Growth based an associative  classifier. It utilizes a prefix tree data structure CR- tree to store the classification rules. CMAR process is completed in two phases: the rule generation and classification. In the first phase, it computes the complete set of rules in the form of R: P ? c with respect the support(R) and confidence(R), where P is a pattern in the training data set and c is a class label.

CMAR chooses only a subset of high quality rules for classification by prune strategies. In the second phase, CMAR accumulates the subset of classification rules matching the new object and looks at their class labels. In the case where all rules have a common class, CMAR simply assigns that class to the test object. In cases where the classes of the accumulated rules are not identical, CMAR divides the rules into separate groups based on their class values and compares the effects of every group to identify the strongest one. The strength of the groups is measured by the weighted ?2 adopted from.

CPAR [17] is another significant associative classifier and this greedy algorithm and is an enhancement of PRM (Predictive Rule Mining) whereas PRM is an extension of FOIL. The distinction between CPAR and PRM is that instead of choosing only the attribute that displays the best gain on each iteration; CPAR may choose a number of attributes if those attributes have similar best gain.

On one hand, CPAR generates and tests more rules than traditional rule-based classifiers. When generating rules, instead of selecting only the best literal, CPAR selects all the close-to-the-best literals to avoid missing important rules. On the other hand, CPAR generates a much smaller set of high-quality predictive rules directly from the dataset than association classification. It avoids producing     redundant rules by considering the set of already- generated rules. Also to avoid over fitting, it uses expected accuracy to evaluate each rule and uses the best k-rules in prediction.

3. Comparative study of Associative Classifier CMAR and CPAR   The two approaches CMAR and CPAR were compared, while implementing the algorithms in jdk1.4.0. All the experiments were performed, keeping the parameters like support and confidence threshold same for both the techniques and were tested on 2.4GHz Pentium-4 PC with 512MB main Memory and UCI machine learning data sets [2]. For CPAR the best five rules are used in prediction in the rule generation algorithm while min gain value was 0.7. Performance comparisons of CMAR and CPAR are showing in Graph 1 and Graph 2. The implementation was done for their performance comparison in terms of execution time, while observing it with ascending records in the test set.

Performance comparison of CMAR  and CPAR for number or rules generated   The implementation of two associative classifier algorithms yields following observations; 1. When dataset contain a large number of rows and  or columns, both rule generation and rule selection in CMAR are time consuming.

2. CPAR achieves high accuracy and efficiency taking less execution time as compared to CMAR, as a. It uses greedy approach in rule generation  which is much more efficient than generating all candidate rules.

b. CPAR generates a smaller set of rules, with higher quality and lower redundancy.

c. CPAR avoids generating redundant rules and uses the best k rules.

CPAR represents a new approach towards efficient and high quality classification. It is interesting to further enhance the efficiency and scalability of this approach and compare it with other well-established classification schemes.

4. Extended Associative Classification Approach   We have observed that the existing associative- classifiers can be modified while incorporating realistic parameters like including time dimension to the mining process. It has already been recognized that transaction data are temporal in nature and therefore in real world data the knowledge used for mining rule is almost time varying and thus appropriate modification is needed.

We are currently investigating associative- classification techniques that are more robust regarding changes in the underlying processes, this work involves techniques that can capture trends and other properties in the rule set, and use these properties to make the better temporal associative classifier.

4.1 Temporal Associative Classification Rule Approach   As many researchers have suggested the items have the dynamic characteristics in terms of transaction, which have seasonal selling rate and it holds time-based association ship with another item.

In real phenomenon time is one of the important factors [5] [7] [18], so we have incorporated the temporal dimension to our investigation. Valuable patterns cannot be discovered by traditional non- temporal data mining approaches that treat all the data as one large segment, with no attention paid to utilizing the time information of the transactions.

The main goal of temporal classification is to predict temporally related fields in temporal databases based on other fields. So far classification research has been considered only on simple classification methods such as significant approaches     CBA, CMAR and CPAR were considered for our investigation and were suitably modified.

In temporal classification lot of work is still to be considered apart from that we have tried to focused on temporal associative classifier (TAC), the main aim of TAC is to straight forward use sampling techniques within time series methods, to build up a model for temporal sequences, just like we say TAC model is to predict the most likely state of categorical variable into it. We have established the main steps of applying our general temporal data mining theory to real world datasets with different methods and models time domain.

Temporal databases differ from traditional transaction data, for each temporal data item the corresponding time related attribute is associated with it, temporal association rules can be more useful and informative than basic association rules. For example rather than the basic association rule of {bread}? {butter} mining from the temporal data we can get a more insight rule that the support of {bread}? {butter} raises to 50% during 7 pm to 10 pm everyday, same as marketing strategy can be planned for weekend sales, obviously retailer scan make more efficient and effective promotion strategy by using temporal association rule. When this is incorporated with Decision Support System it can play a very important useful in organization to give there prediction on the bases of time [5] [7]. The main goal of prediction is to predict some fields in a database based on time domain thus to predict the most likely state of a categorical variable (the class) in time domain.

5. Comparative Study of Modified Approach and Discussions   We have performed extensive study on the  associative-classification algorithms and three most popular approaches in associative classification i.e.

CBA, CMAR and CPAR were modified with temporal dimension. The modified techniques were implemented while using the UCI machine learning data sets [2] for performance comparison. The temporal aspect was introduced in the approach and calendar schema [7][18] was used for categorizing the given dataset according to temporal intervals by random temporal filtering.

While implementing the temporal associative classifiers it was thought significant to perform comparative study of three associative classifiers along with their accuracy check. The resultant graph exhibits that TCPAR still performs much better in terms of execution time as compared to TCMAR and  is little better than TCBA, which is evident from comparative graph and table as shown below as well.

The TAC approaches TCBA, TCMAR and TCPAR were implemented on the temporally modified   dataset of   UCI machine learning data sets [2]. Graph displays run-time of these algorithms for different support values (Graph 3).

The resultant graph shows that the TCBA is time- consuming for smaller support values and improves in run-time performance as the support increases. The temporal CPAR shows rather a steady performance and remains a better performer throughout for varying support values (Table 1). The better performance of TCPAR contributes to the fact that CPAR uses greedy approach in rule generation, which is much more efficient than generating all candidate rules. Also TCPAR uses a dynamic programming approach to avoid repeated calculation.

It is therefore recommended that our approach will use this better and improved approach of TCPAR for Market Basket Analysis and other similar applications.

Performance as per time   Execution time for varying Support values Support  20 30 40 50 60 70 80 TCBA  2.060  1.660 1.280 0.930 0.770 0.650 0.620 TCMAR  99.290  68.829 58.705 2.794 1.072 0.641 0.561 TCPAR  0.511  0.511 0.500 0.480 0.480 0.470 0.470           0 20 40 60 80 Support  Ti m  e (S  ec )  TCBA TCMAR TCPAR    Graph 3. Comparative performance of TCBA,  TCMAR and TCPAR  5.1 Accuracy Comparison for Temporal Associative Classifiers   The three significant associative classifiers were compared in terms of accuracy; the comparison was done on various datasets and after having it done for     10 datasets the average accuracy was calculated to find that;  (i) Although all three TACs were close but the TCPAR was found little better then TCMAR.

(ii) The temporal counterpart of all the three associative classifiers has shown improved classification accuracy as compared to the non- temporal associative classifier.

Table 2. Comparing the associative  classifiers for classifying accuracy with the temporal counterparts   The above results are extremely significant as our  proposed temporal CPAR gives better classification accuracy as compared to other two approaches   6. Conclusion   The effectiveness of the predictive analytics would depend upon its predictive accuracy and execution time in classifying an unknown object. The predictive mechanism can be made more usable and relevant if we could identify an appropriate data mining technique. Valuable patterns cannot be discovered by traditional non-temporal data mining approaches that treat all the data as one large segment, with no attention paid to utilizing the time information of the transactions.

We have extensively studied the performance issues of significant associative classifiers CBA, CMAR and CPAR, with and without temporal dimension.  While CPAR exhibiting a better performance than CMAR, our experimentation done for ten significant data sets was concluded to see that TACs perform better in terms of classifier accuracy as compared to their non-temporal counterparts. This assumes significance because the transactional data have shown definite time-sensibilities and most of the data mining approach does not include the temporal aspect into the mining process considering that this  may further slow down or complicate the process of knowledge generation. Our proposed temporal approach TCPAR while performing better in terms of run-time and accuracy both also ensures of finding some new rules which were not ?visible? in the non- temporal associative classification approaches. It is also noteworthy that the idea of CPAR in choosing the best k-rules directly from the dataset brings improvement in the overall performance.

This data mining approach will be extremely useful in improved decision making not only in the field of Market Basket Analysis but also in Credit Card ratings and developing Causal relationships in a large number of applications.

However the performance comparison shows that accuracy check for temporal approaches were improved compared to their counterparts, it would be of future interest to analyse the reasons for improvements to further details.
