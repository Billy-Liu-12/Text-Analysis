A Study on Association among Dispatching Rules  in Manufacturing Scheduling Problems

Abstract - There m many scheduling strategies, called dispatching rules, for man- systems. However, those rules can be applied mainly to simple manufaankg systems. In this paper we propose a way to evaluate the effectiveness of such dispatching rules in the enviraunent of complex manufaawing systems in the sense that there exist two performance measures. Defining a new conce~t of closeness of dkptdhg ruls with mpect to a performance measurp, we can find a set ofclose dispatching rules fortheperfamance meame. This will give us some guidance about which dispatching rules may apply at each dispatching point in a manufaan@ system under two or more performance measu~ps in prauice. Forthepurpme a bxhniqw of data mining plays an important role.

Let  Zbe a given set of dispatching rules for each machine:  X * Y  w h e r e x c ~ , ~ ~ ~ a n d x n ~ =  4. ~ n t h i ~ p a g e r , a n aSSOciation rule is given by, for example,  Z=(EDD,SLACK,SPT).

Then the total of nine combinations of dispatchins rules canbe applied to the flow shop. Fur example, EDD is applied to the fim machine, and SLACK (Shortest SLACK T i  First) is aplied to the second machim. We write this kind of wmbinatimofdqatchingrules WD&SLACK,andmon  suppose that one of the objectives is to minimize the maximumtard inessandtheOthe?is tominimize the~~W time. Ihe values of performance measufes by using each CMbinatiOn of dispatching rules are evaluated by using a discrete event simulation[5]. At first, a set of n jobs is mated.

For the set each of nine mbdm of dispatching rules is appkdto obtain the maximum tardims of the jobs. By using these nine simulation runs, a set willbe mated as follows:  De=( T-z EZXZIz=e / (a ,Tm)}  (10)  where a isagivenpositiverealnun&xande~ZXZisthe best combination of dispatchiry! rules that gave the minimum valueof the ma'lrimum tardiness among a set of rrine simulation nm% Note that De at least ircludes the 00mbinatiOn e.
