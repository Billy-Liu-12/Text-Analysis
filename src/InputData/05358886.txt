A Novel Knowledge Discovery Model for Fishery Forecasting

Abstract?In the area of ocean fisheries research, a new research interest is to use marine environment factors for fishery forecasting. This paper proposes a novel knowledge discovery model for fishery forecasting that uses the Indian Ocean big-eye tuna fishery as its testing ground. The model employs a 3-step process. Firstly the support vectors can be obtained by training the Support Vector Machine (SVM) with some sample data. Secondly rules can be extracted from the support vectors by the fuzzy classifier. Finally the fishery dynamic knowledge with due consideration of various dynamic factors can be obtained through extension transformation for the conditions and the conduction transformation for the conclusions. This paper is of great significance for enriching fisheries forecasting methods and revealing the formation mechanism of fishing grounds.

I.  INTRODUCTION The development of artificial intelligence and data  mining technology has led to an increasing number of applications using intelligent information processing method for fishery forecasting. For example, Shen and Ye[1] applied artificial intelligence as the basis for an intelligent centric fishery forecasting system and proposed the exact center fishing grounds forecast model. Du and Zhou[2] proposed marine fisheries data and the corresponding temperature and temperature gradient between the time-space distribution model. They analyzed the application of spatial data mining methods and GIS in conjunction to the field of fisheries. Xu[3] from the Shanghai Ocean University selected a group of strong impact factors from a large number of marine environmental factors and established the mathematical prediction model of Western and Central Pacific Ocean tuna purse-seine production through multiple regressions.

However, these studies have failed to resolve the following issues. (1) Currently most fishery forecasting use multiple regression analysis, but the dynamic marine environment factors are inconsistent with the premise of regression analysis- the variables must be independent and normal distribution. (2) Most studies focus on the static knowledge of fishery whereas we emphasize the critical role of the dynamic knowledge in relation to environmental factors and  their impact on the accuracy of fishing ground forecasts.

Unfortunately there has been little report on using dynamic knowledge.

This paper utilizes several theories including Support Vector Machines, Fuzzy theory and the theory of Extenics and proposes a novel knowledge discovery model for fishery forecasting. It uses the Indian Ocean big-eye tuna as a testing ground for the model.



II. CONCEPT AND THEOREM Support Vector Machine, first proposed by Cortes and  Vapnik in 1995[4], has had a huge influence on machine learning in recent years. The basic idea involves mapping the training data set into high dimensional feature space by non- linear mapping. The purpose is to change the linear inseparable data sets of the input space into the linear separable data sets by mapping the linear inseparable data sets into high dimensional feature space, and then building an optimal separating hyperplanes of maximum range in feature space. This is equivalent to establishing an optimal non-linear boundary in input space[5].

The Fuzzy Set theory and fuzzy logic proposed by Zadeh[6] largely reflect the process of human cognition about objective things. It is easy for us to understand the reasoning process using the fuzzy rules to do pattern classification. The fuzzy rules model is as follows:  1 1 2 2: . , . , ..., .

j j j  j m mR IF x A x A x A . 1, 2,...,jTHEN y B j n?  where, 1 2( , , ..., )mx x x x? are input variables, j  iA is the semantic value of the ith input variables in jth rule, y is the output variables, jB is the semantic value of the conclusion y in jth rule.

Extenics was established by Cai in 1983[7] who investigated the way to solve a contradictory question.

Extenics is the use of extension transformation, that is, from the perspective of changes to change false proposition into a true proposition, to transform the unknown problem into a known problem, and to turn the unfeasible problem into a feasible problem[8].

Extenics studies the dynamics of knowledge, including expansion, implication, and incidence function. Among them,   DOI 10.1109/FSKD.2009.331    DOI 10.1109/FSKD.2009.331     excavating implication is important in extension data mining.

Extension data mining can obtain dynamic knowledge, through conditions extension transformation and conclusions conduction transformation.

III.  THE MODEL OF FISHERY KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY FOR FISHERY FORECASTING  A. The model of  knowledge discovery for fishery forecasting The model of knowledge discovery for fishery  forecasting is shown in Figure 1. It includes a data layer, a mining layer, a knowledge layer and an application layer.

Figure 1.  The model of knowledge discovery for fishery forecasting  B. Functions of each layer 1) Data layer  In the data layer, the marine environmental data and fisheries operating data go through a process of data matching and data cleaning before being stored into the mining database.

2) Mining layer The mining layer is to carry out fishery static knowledge  discovery and fishery dynamic knowledge discovery. Static knowledge discovery uses Support Vector Machine classification and fuzzy classification rule extraction method.

Dynamic knowledge discovery uses expansion reasoning and conduction reasoning in Extenics to obtain dynamic knowledge by the process of extension transformation and conduction transformation from static knowledge.

3) Knowledge layer Storing the static and dynamic knowledge effectively is  the key task of the knowledge layer. A relational database is used in this model. The most important elements are the antecedent, the consequent and the credibility.

4) Application layer This layer explains the fishing grounds formation  mechanism and fishery forecasting results following the aforementioned knowledge generation process.

C. Fishery knowledge discovery 1) Static knowledge discovery based on SVM and Fuzzy  theory a) Acquire support vectors  In this model, we use Support Vector Machine classification algorithm to acquire support vectors through training the randomly selected marine environment data and fisheries operating data. This problem belongs to non-linear classification problem, which mainly uses non-linear transformation to change the problem into linear problem of a high dimensional space. It is related to the inner product operation between training samples, so according to Functional Theory, instead of computing the dot product on the transformed data tuples, it turns out that it is mathematically equivalent to applying a kernel function to the original input data instead.

Kernel function is a function K, for all , jix x K? to meet:  ( , ) ( ( ) ( ))i j i jK x x x x? ?? ? ?????????????????????????  Where, ?  is the mapping from X to (inner product) feature space F.

The kernel functions are as follows: ? Gaussian radial basis function kernel:    || || ( , ) exp  i  i  x x K x x  ?  ? ? ?  ? ? ? ? ? ?  (2)  Where, ix is the center of the kernel function, ?  is the width parameter.

? Polynomial kernel of degree d:     ( , ) ( )di iK x x x x c? ? ? , 0, 1, 2,...,c d N? ?        (3) ? Sigmoid kernel:  ( , ) tanh( ( ) )i iK x x v x x c? ? ? , ,v c are constants  (4)  b) Extract rules based on fuzzy classification When the fuzzy basic function is the Gaussian  membership function or kernel functions of SVM meet the Mercer conditions and simultaneously they are the bounded functions, Support Vector Machine problem is similar to general fuzzy rules model. Therefore, rules extraction can be achieved through a method that combines support vector machine model and fuzzy rules model algorithm.

In SVM classification problems, the final separating hyperplane is defined as:  ( ) ( , )i i i SV  f x K x x? ?  ??                             (5)  ( )i i i SV  w x? ? ?  ??                        (6)  Where i i iy? ?? , i? is Lagrange multiplier, w is the weight vector.

In formula (5), only a few of sample points 0i? ? , that is support vectors, suppose support vectors  ? ?1 2 | |, , ...,i i i SVSV x x x? , SV is the number of the support vectors, ijx expresses the ith input value of the jth support  vector. Coefficient sets ? ?1 2 | |, , ...,i i i SVCO ? ? ?? , so formula (5) and (6) can be written as:  | |   ( ) ( , ) SV  ik ik k  f x K x x? ?  ??                  (7) | |   ( ) SV  ik ik k  w x? ? ?  ??             (8) As i i iy? ?? , SV and CO can make the following forms  of fuzzy rules tenable: IF x close to ikx  THEN i?  close to | |ik? ,  1, 2,...,| |k SV? Because the support vectors are the points nearest to the  separating hyperplane, they are often distributed on the edges of two fuzzy sets[9] [10]. For the ith factor in this experiment,  ijC is the jth level, k iju is the degree of membership of ix on  ij C , where ix is the factor of the kth support vector, the principle of fuzzy rules extraction as shown in Figure 2 below:   Figure 2.  Principle of extracting fuzzy rules  Figure 2 shows fuzzy rules extraction about a two-factor two-level experiment where input sample is 1 2( , , )x x y ,  11C and 12C are the semantic values of 1x , 21C and 22C are the semantic values of  2x . Through SVM training, two support  vectors can be acquired, namely 1P =(0.7,0.7,? ), ?  2P =(0.95,0.9,??)?  According to Figure 2, for 1P ,  1 1 11 12u u? ?  1 1 21 22u u? , so  12C and 21C  are selected, as the semantic values of this rule, the rule is:  1 1 12 2 21: . , .    .R IF x C x C THEN y I For  2P , similarly, the other rule is:  2 1 11 2 22: . , .    .R IF x C x C THEN y II 2) Dynamic knowledge discovery based on Extenics  On the basis of fishery static knowledge, dynamic knowledge discovery can be divided into the following three steps through extension data mining:  The first step is to acquire fishery static knowledge through Support Vector Machine and fuzzy rule extraction.

The second step is to determine the existence of extension transformation by comparing the antecedents and to determine the existence of conduction transformation by comparing the consequents.

The third step is to obtain two types of dynamic knowledge by extension transformation for conditions and conduction transformation for conclusions based on Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 discussed above.



IV. EXPERIMENTS  A. Data preparation Fisheries operating data for the testing of the model is  taken from Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) official website. The statistical data from the Japanese website that are selected as original sample data are abundant and normative. The corresponding Indian Ocean environment data is extracted from the environment database owned by Columbia University using software developed by us. The original data is sorted by month and year with a corresponding record for every specific area in the Indian Ocean.

B. Fishery static knowledge discovery On the basis of the research by domain experts in relation  to the living habits of the Indian Ocean big-eye tuna, the following eight environmental factors are chosen as the training samples: temperature of sea water in depth of 187.5 meters, 212.5 meters, 237.5 meters, 262.5 meters, salinity of sea water in depth of 212.5 meters, 237.5 meters, vertical flow of sea water in depth of 225 meters, 250 meters and the corresponding fisheries operating data of these depths above.

The support vectors are acquired by support vector machine training. Then fuzzy rules are extracted by the principle of fuzzy rules extraction. In this experiment, 18 pieces of static knowledge can be discovered with a list of three of them shown in Table 1.

In Table 1, T represents the temperature of sea water, S represents the salinity of sea water, VF represents the vertical flow of sea water.

V. CONCLUSIONS Several issues in fishery forecasting have triggered this  research reported here that proposes a novel model of fishery knowledge discovery. Firstly, the Marine environment remote sensing data can not satisfy the postulate of the multiple linear regression because it has neither normal distribution nor independent identity distribution. So the fishery static knowledge discovery method is proposed based on Support Vector Machine and Fuzzy Set theory, and the static knowledge has been extracted. Meanwhile the characteristics of dynamic changes of Marine environment have to be taken into consideration in fishery forecast.

Consequently the fishery dynamic knowledge discovery method is proposed based on Extenics, via the use of dynamic knowledge which reflects the changes of the catch rates under the Marine environment factors. The resulting model can acquire the dynamic knowledge with a forceful interpretive capacity and enhance the universality and sharability of forecasting knowledge. It can also provide theoretical and methodological development for intelligent information processing applied to pelagic fishery forecasting.
