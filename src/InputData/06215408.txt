I. INTRODUCTION  In the information age, e-learning is the convergence of the Internet and learning. It is a popular learning method in education. The core of an e-learning system is the student assessment, which facilitates teachers to evaluate a student?s knowledge level; furthermore, the precise measurement helps the students knowledge development reaches their full poten- tial. The adaptive testing has been applied to the learning assessment in computer-based learning. It is recognized as computer adaptive testing (CAT). CAT is a combination of a measurement theory and computer technology to provide a precise measurement in computer-based learning. The heart of conventional CAT systems is an item selection procedure, which is usually represented in different forms of decision trees. A CAT system requires the standard items with item response theory (IRT) parameters stored in the item bank and the decision-making procedure to assign the suitable item to each examinee.

Usually, the conventional CAT systems are based on client/server architecture and web-based technologies (WBT) [1]. It contains its own item bank, which is stored separately in many repositories of database and item bank over the Internet.

This database contains the items, which is stored. Since, it lacks of the share ability, each item bank cannot be used in the other systems and applications. This makes the items are not reused and shared. Thus, the collection of the items from many repositories of database together makes these items were reused, and also makes the large item bank. Unfortunately, the combined items make the large data size. The problem of data overloaded occurs, and a large number of irrelevant and redundant data should be eliminated. Moreover, these existing data are also different in the data structure. Thus, this paper use data mining to overcome this problem. Data mining is the process of analyzing data in order to the extraction of implicit, useful information and interesting patterns from large data collections [2], [3]. Recently, a number of data mining applications have been applied for a variety of domains includ- ing marketing, banking, finance, manufacturing and education.

A data mining process was investigated to provide structured management data for decision support in the customer service.

It can be utilized to assist the customer service in supporting its activities [4]. In the case of education, educational data mining is an emerging discipline, concerned with developing methods for exploring the unique types of data that come from the educational context. The prior study surveyed the specific application of data mining in learning management systems (LMS) and a case study tutorial. In order to introduce it both theoretically and practically to the students in particular to online instructors and e-learning administrators which applied to mine the e-learning data [5]. In the same way, data mining was applied for processing student data. The previous study focused on discovering patterns from Web logs and data. The semantic structure was built with the patterns that students could use this structure for getting knowledge out of available information on their own schedule [6]. Most of the data mining techniques applied to educational systems demonstrated one of the three types of analysis: classification, association rule mining and text mining [7]. In addition, data mining has also been applied to other types of data such as time-series, spatial, telecommunications, web, and multimedia data.

Data mining is not a solution itself, instead it is a tool     Fig. 1. Overall data mining process to provide the item-set to the student.

which supports a decision-making process, which tries to ensure required knowledge in order to reach the solution of the problem [8]. The huge data volume causes greater difficulties in extracting useful information for decision support. Since, traditional data analysis has become insufficient, the methods for efficient computer-based analysis essential [3].

The mined item from many repositories of the database will be delivering to the different kind of CAT applications in order to overcome the interoperable problem. The study of data mining for CAT systems, the following factors are essential; an item-set requirement and adaptive testing algorithm. An item-set has built for assessment process whereas the adaptive testing algorithm is the knowledge which used for create the item pattern and item-set. Usually, the adaptive testing algorithm uses the decision tree [9], [10] to build the item pattern. One of the practical trees is a triangle decision tree (TDT) [11]. In TDT structure, each item is classified into the right location node by determining decision parameters in order to generate an optimal item-set.

Although, the huge data has overcome successfully, they have not provided its services to the different platforms of the CAT application. This is because the system still does not offer the interoperability for item interchange between systems. The interoperability is an interconnection of hetero- geneous systems and allows the communication of different applications from different sources to each other. In order to provide the interoperability to the CAT system, Web service is proposed to overcome the interoperability issue on CAT systems. Moreover, the Web service is platform independent; it can work with almost CAT application regardless of their programming language.

In summary, the combination of items from many sources makes the larger item bank. The data mining process can be extracted the useful information in order to create the optimal item-set using the knowledge pattern. The precise items help the students improve their knowledge reach their full potential.

This remaining paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the proposed method, which consists of the problem  TABLE I AN ESSENTIAL DATA STRUCTURE OF A CAT ITEM  Elements Description Type  Index Item index Number  QUE Question String  CA Choice A String  CB Choice B String  CC Choice C String  CD Choice D String  QANS Item index String  IA IRT Discrimination Float  IB IRT Difficulty Float  IC IRT Guessing Float  definition and the data mining processes. The problem of item classification will be examined from a decision tree and rule induction perspective. Section 3 gives a system implementa- tion, approaches for identifying components. In Section 4 the experiment results on the data mining are discussed. Finally, section 5 concludes the paper and gives some future direction.



II. PROPOSED METHOD  In this section, the problem definition, data mining processes and related theoretical knowledge are described.

A. Problem definition  The problem definition phase is the first phase of the data mining process. During this phase, the objectives of using data mining on the desired problem are identified. Likewise, the overall process is designed to define the function and relation- ship. As shown in Fig.1, the overall data mining components consist of item bank, pre-processing, items, pattern, knowledge and item-set.

Usually the CAT system stores the item bank in its database.

The data structure of the item bank was designed for the spe- cific CAT application such as Learning Management Systems (LMS), CAT application, online assessment and other item     Fig. 2. Major steps in the data mining process.

bank database. Since the different in the data structure, these items cannot be used in the other CAT systems. Howover, almost items are the multiple choices, and based on the Item Response Theory (IRT) thus some parameters can analyses by the experts. The combination of items from many repositories makes the larger item bank, various subject, and increases the value. Since the items come from many repositories, these items are investigated at the pre-processing step. In order to extract the useful information from the various and complex database, the knowledge pattern will be built. By applying the tree structure and adaptive testing algorithm, the item parameters have to identify the relationship. Association rule is established to make the knowledge pattern that the most CAT application can perceive the item-set structure. Since structure identification is studied, the complex data structures from databases are simplified to the minimum essential data struc- ture. The basic fields of the CAT process are shown in Table 1. This structure excludes the information of subject, chapter, section, and learning objective. This basic data structure makes all CAT applications make use of the items from many repositories. The method to deliver the knowledge pattern to CAT application is one of the problems to consider. Since the CAT applications are different platform and programming language, Web service is implemented.

B. Data Mining Process  Data mining, also known as knowledge discovery in databases (KDD), is a rapidly emerging field. This method help analyzes, understand or even visualize the huge amounts of data gathered from any sources. It is the process of discovering interesting knowledge, such as patterns, associa- tions, changes, anomalies and significant structures from huge amounts of data in databases, or other information repositories.

It can be help to make a better decision [4].

The data mining studying in research communities include summarization, association, classification, prediction and clus- tering [12].

Data mining process involves defining the problem to be  solved, the acquisition of background knowledge regarding this problem, the selection of useful data, the pre-processing of the data, the analysis and interpretation of the results, and the actual use of these results as depicted in Fig. 1.

In Fig. 2, the most common process of the data mining is in the following seven steps [13].

1) Data cleaning: To remove noise and inconsistent data from different repositories of the item bank. Since these item banks were designed with the different of structure and repository, the item data priorities were weighted. Low priorities item data will be eliminated, and the cleaned data have the best chance of mining their data successfully.

2) Data integration: The item data from multiple reposito- ries of an item bank were combined. These items are collected from LMS database, general item bank and online assessment.

Although there are several steps involved in data integration, the most important is de-duplicating the records which can eliminate an unusable data.

3) Data selection: The relevant data to the student as- sessment are retrieved from the item bank database. The selected data needs to determine thresholds, limitations and other selection criteria.

4) Data transformation: The item data are consolidated into forms that appropriate for mining by performing summary.

Once the best data has been selected, it is transformed into a set and optimized for use in the CAT applications. All data fields are consolidated, merged and purged, thus they are easy to index and use for the data mining process.

5) Data mining: It is the most essential process in order to extract data patterns which appropriate to the CAT system.

This process involves searching the various fields of the database. These are used to identify trends that can be matched against the knowledge that represents the learning objective prospects. The process is complete when the mined data is according to the learning objective.

6) Pattern evaluation: To create the items patterns based on the assessment parameters and associated rules. The patterns that emerges during the data mining process is evaluated     follow the associated rules.

7) Knowledge presentation: The items are manipulated in  the form of the item-set. This item-set is ready to present clearly, which the general CAT application easy to digest format.

Before building the item-set, the two major concepts have to consider in creating the item pattern are the CAT algo- rithm and student psychological model. CAT is based on the dichotomous algorithm [14]. Each item has only two way of the decision that is correct or wrong as depicted in Fig. 3.

Thus, this paper represents the TDT in manipulating the item- set. Like a traditional decision tree [15], TDT is a binary tree like structure. Each node has only two branches; left and right branches, for child nodes. The left branch denotes a wrong outcome while the right branch denotes a correct outcome.

Within the TDT, each internal node denotes an item on IRT parameters; and each branch represents an outcome of the item. Each path from the root to a leaf node forms a rule.

Before building a TDT, the items are prepared. Each item includes a set of the IRT parameters. For instance, at the item number I1,1, which is the root node. The next item is item number I2,2, if the answer is correct. In contrast, the next item is item number I2,1, if the answer is wrong as shown in Fig. 3(a). The process repeats until the end of a tree node.

Each node represents three IRT parameters; discrimination, difficulty, and guessing, respectively, as shown in Fig. 4.

With symmetrical structure of TDT as shown in Fig.3(b), the number of items can be calculated by equation (1).

M = 1 + 2 + 3 + ...+ n = n  (n+ 1) (1)  where M , is a number of items in TDT structure, and n is the number of levels. In general, the number of items, M , in the TDT structure denotes the minimum requirement of the number of items for making the knowledge pattern in each item-set or subset. Simultaneously, the number of levels, n, represents actually the number of items for the test.

In student psychological model, this concept considers the item difficulty involve to the student behavior. Since, the first item is not critical to measurement, it may be critical to the psychological state of the examinee. A first item that is much too hard, and the examinees may immediately fall into despair, and not even attempt to do well. Meanwhile, a first item is much too easy, and the examinee may not take the test seriously and so make careless mistakes [16]. Gershon [17] suggests that the first item should be a little on the easy side in order to give the examinees a feeling in a situation as a challenge. This psychological model leads to define the association rules and knowledge patterns.

The basic concept of mining association rules can be stated as follows: Let I = {i1, i2, ..., im} be a set of items. Let T = (t1, t2, ..., tn) be a set of items, where each item ti is a set of items such that ti ? I . An association rule is an inference of pattern, X ? Y where X ? I, Y ? I and X ?Y = ?, X (or Y ) [18] is a set of items, which is called an item-set. From Fig. 3, the association rule of the IRT parameter of parent  (a) (b)  Fig. 3.

node and its two branches, which give the IRT parameters as follows.

Let Ai,j {ai+1,j , ai+1,j+1}, where Ai,j is the discrimination parameter at ith order and jth order, ai+1,j and ai+1,j+1 are the discrimination parameter of left-side branch and right-side branch respectively.

Let Bi,j {bi+1,j , bi+1,j+1}, where Bi,j is the difficulty pa- rameter at ith order and jth order, bi+1,j and bi+1,j+1 are the difficulty parameter of left-side branch and right-side branch respectively.

Finally, let Ci,j {ci+1,j , ci+1,j+1}, where Ci,j is the guess- ing parameter at ith order and jth order, ci+1,j and ci+1,j+1 are the guessing parameter of left-side branch and right-side branch respectively.

Thus, the combination of association rules of the three parameters is parent ? [branch, branch] when applied all parameters is Ii,j {ai,j , bi,j , ci,j} ? [Ii+1,j {ai+1,j , bi+1,j , ci+1,j} , ...

Ii+1,j+1 {ai+1,j+1, bi+1,j+1, ci+1,j+1}]  The parent to branches relationship of the items.

{ai+1,j+1, bi+1,j+1, ci+1,j+1} (2)  As depicted in (2), the parent parameters are greater than the left-branch but less than the right-branch.

The transitive relationship of the adjacent items in the same level of a tree.

{ai,1, bi,1, ci,1} < {ai,2, bi,2, ci,2} < ... < {ai,j , bi,j , ci,j} (3) As depicted in (3), All parameters of an item are increasing from left-side to right-side.

As described, the data mining process is used to extract the useful items from many repositories. The associate rules are established from the basic knowledge of the adaptive testing such as dichotomous algorithm, IRT parameters, TDT structure and student psychological model. These rules will be used to create the item-set pattern.



III. IMPLEMENTATION  In this section, the data mining processes are conducted using the three different kinds of the data repositories which consist of LMS, CAT online application, and the generic item bank database.

Fig. 4. Triangle decision tree structure represent in IRT parameters.

Usually, the general LMS consists of an assessment part thus items are stored inside the LMSs database on the web server.

This database is large and complicate structure. Like a LMS, the CAT online application contains a specific data structure which is created inside the database on the web server. It is the almost small and simple structure. A generic item bank is the database that contains the large number of the items.

Moreover, it also consists of the redundant and inconsistent data such as a number of section, chapter, subjects, etc. This system is developed using ASP.NET Web service and hosted on the web server which operates on Windows 7 and IIS web server. This Web service connects to three data repositories via the Internet, and does the mining processes to make the item- set according to the request from the applications. In order to evaluate of the mining process, the CAT application is also developed on the other web server. It is developed to verify the mining processes and does the student assessment. In addition, it communicates with Web service to investigate the item-set correctness that is created from the knowledge pattern and the association rules.

According to the association rules and knowledge pattern, the items are random selected from the item banks to create the various item-set sizes. The variety of item-set size is used to verify the flexibility of the association rules and knowledge pattern.



IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  In order to verify the proposed method, many conditions were set up. By applying the association rules and knowledge pattern, the item pattern was built. After that, the mined items were created the item-set, which was described using a XML schema. Since XML is the standard data format, the item-  set could use on the independent platform. A part of the item-set was represented using XML as shown in Fig. 5.

This XML schema was transferred to the CAT application according to its request, and then the CAT application used the item-set for the student examination. The student interface screen is shown in Fig.6. From the overall process, the results showed that the association rules and knowledge pattern in the mining process worked correctly. Moreover, many item- sets were created by various sizes to verify the accuracy of the rules and its performance. The results revealed that the mining process could extract the items from the many repositories to create the item-set, and it worked properly.

The evaluation of the item-set is a key aspect of the data mining process. The knowledge and learning models from several domains were combined to make the association rules, which were used to make the item-set. The item-set not only represented the item properties, but it also showed the students ability level.



V. CONCLUSION  This paper has attempted to formulate the data mining model in create the optimal item-set from the different sources of the item. The item data from many repositories were mined in order to extract the implicit, useful information and inter- esting patterns from the huge irrelevant and redundant data collections. Therefore, the association rules were established by applying the knowledge pattern, decision trees, adaptive testing algorithm and related theory. The results showed that the association rules and mining process were used to create the optimal item-set, it worked properly. This optimal item-set was delivered through Web service to the CAT applications in order to verify the accuracy and precision of the association     Fig. 5.

rules and knowledge pattern.

In summary, this paper showed the great interest in the data mining process. An aggregation of the items from the variety of structure and many sources made the larger item bank.

The data mining process could extract the useful information in order to create the optimal item-set using the knowledge pattern. The results revealed that data mining process worked properly.

The benefit of the proposed process can create the larger item bank by collecting from the many resources. The existing item bank can share to the other applications. The precise items helped the students improve their knowledge reach their full potential. In addition, the proposed process can apply to the other learning content format in order to extract the useful learning resources which lead to the sharable learning resource network.
