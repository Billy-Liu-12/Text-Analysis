PROPOSING A RECOMMENDER SYSTEM THROUGH MINING ENGLISH

Abstract: This paper presents a sentence reading recommender  system through mining engineering students' English reading  comprehension error patterns. Students were first trained to  analyze sentences in the steps of Cumulative Sentence Analysis  (CSA). The errors produced by the students during their  reading process were used as the database for data mining.

The results of data mining showed that distinctive error  patterns and association rules were identified for different  groups of students. Based on the association rules of the error patterns, suitable sentences for the students to practice were  recommended.

Introduction  Previous studies have revealed that English reading comprehension ability has been regarded as essential in English instruction [1], [2]. Especially for engineering students, reading in English is the core competence to absorb professional knowledge in academic settings and their future career, because many authentic textbooks and information about advanced technology have been published in English. However, it has been recognized that there is still a considerable number of engineering students struggling with reading in English in Taiwan.

Numerous e-learning systems have been constructed for enhancing English reading comprehension. In order to effectively help students solve their reading problems, some authors have proposed adaptive learning through recommender systems. Growing attention has been received in the application of recommender system to various fields.

Recommender systems that provide useful information for targeted searching and learning based on personal features and profile have been widely used in the industry and academia. In educational settings, a recommender system is   like an intelligent system, which can identify student groups with the same or similar patterns, according to students' previous online searching actions or features, such as portfolio, interest, learning performance, or learning styles.

A recommender system is able to recommend different learning materials to fit students' needs, talent and interest, in order to increase learning efficiency and shorten learning time. Some researchers have used recommender systems to suggest learning materials or resources [3], [4], [5], [6], recommend courses [7] or predict learning outcome [8].

Concerning English reading, it has been reported that recommender systems are able to provide recommendation for English learners to improve their reading comprehension. A personalized English learning recommender system was proposed by Hsu to suggest reading lessons based on students' interest [9]. Another recommender system taking both preferences and knowledge levels of the participants as well as categories and traits of articles into consideration provide expert-like recommendations of reading materials [2]. Wang, Tseng, & Liao employed a decision tree algorithm, based on students' profiles, including gender, personality type, cognitive style, learning style and grades to explore the most adaptive learning sequences for a particular teaching content, in order to optimize learning outcomes [10].

Although the results of previous studies have indicated positive learning outcome through recommender systems in English reading comprehension, none of the reviewed recommender systems have focused on English for science and technology. This study therefore aims to create a recommender system to foster engineering students' English reading comprehension based on students' weaknesses. In order to identify English reading comprehension errors of the participants, this paper adapted the approach of Cumulative Syntactic Analysis (CSA) proposed by Chang [11], which has been established in an e-learning system where each student's correct reactions and errors during their reading process can be recorded. In a      recent study, error patterns among CSA steps were identified through data mining [12].

In the following sections, we first describe the CSA reading approach. Then the paper adopts a core data mining technique, association rule, to identify the patterns of students' reading comprehension errors. The recommender system development and data mining processes are described subsequently.

2. CSA reading approach  In the framework of CSA, reading comprehension is regarded as a problem, which belongs to a hierarchy of units and sections. The resolution to each problem, i.e. the comprehension of a sentence consists of six steps. The reading materials were adapted from Absolute C++ [13].

The students have received explicit CSA on-line reading instruction. The six steps of the CSA Instruction are described below:  1. Identify finite verbs: Click on the finite verb(s) of the sentence. The chosen correct finite verbs will tum red.

The number of finite verbs will be indicated in the brackets after each sentence.

2. Identify keywords (such as relative pronouns or conjunctions, only in non-simple sentences). Click on the keywords, and then chosen correct keywords will tum green. There are no keywords in simple sentences.

3. Divide clauses (only in non-simple sentences): Click on the different clauses in non-simple sentences. The number of the clauses will be written in the brackets.

4. Find the subject and main verb in each clause: Each set of subject and verb will be shown in different colors.

The number of the words which should be chosen will be represented in the brackets after each sentence.

5. Add words incrementally: Click on the words to be added in the same batch. Repeat the process until the original sentence is restored .

6. Translate the sentence: Translate all partial results in the previous step as well as the original sentence.

3. English reading recommender system  A total of 180 freshmen of information engineering department at a university in southern Taiwan were selected as the experimental sample. The sample included three groups (Group A, N = 61, Group B, N = 58, Group C, N = 61). These students had studies English for at least 6 years since junior high school. The age of the students ranged from 18 to 20. The CSA blended e-learning English instruction lasted for 12 weeks, 2 hours a week. After 12 weeks of instruction, an assessment was administered to register the students' responses during their reading process.

Figure 2 presents the flow chart of the research method.

First, the students receive the CSA reading instruction. By the end of the instruction, the students take the CSA-based reading test. Then, the association rules algorithm is applied to analyze the association of error patterns in each group.

After that, recommendations for sentence reading exercises are made for students with similar error patterns.

In order to examine the performance of the participants after CSA instruction, an on-line CSA test was constructed. First, 7 major sentence patterns were identified from an authentic textbook on C++ programming, Absolute C++. Among 7 patterns, a total of 112 sentences were selected from the textbook. For each sentence, multiple choice questions were created based on the 6 steps of CSA.

The multiple choice questions contained error patterns of each step in the CSA. Therefore, the question bank contained 672 multiple choice questions. For each on-line test, the system automatically selected 21 sentences, 3 from each of the 7 patterns. The participants were required to answer 3 sentences for 7 patterns in 6 steps (N = 3x7x6 =  126). The results of the assessment served as the data to be analyzed for recommendation. From reviewing the errors produced by the students in the previous semester, frequent error types were found in each step. These frequent error types were randomly selected as distracters in each item.

For each item, the students had to choose one correct answer among 4 or 5 choices. Table 1 shows the error type-item mapping.

Analysis and results  The recommender system presented in this paper incorporates the data mining technique of association rules algorithm into its methodology. In this study, four measures are used to identify students' features reading comprehension problems: confidence, lift, leverage and  conviction. The rule confidence is defined as the percentage of items containing Y in addition to X with regard to the overall number of items containing X. Formula for calculating the confidence values is shown in formula (1).

ifid Total occurrencefor item X and Y 100% (1) can 1 ence = x 0  Total occurrence for item X  The lift in an association rule indicates the importance of a rule. The lift value is the ratio of the confidence of the rule and the expected confidence of the rule. The expected confidence of a rule is defined as the confidence divided by the support of the head, as shown in formula (2).

Lift (X -> Y) = P(X, Y)/[P(X)P(Y)] (2)  Leverage measures the difference of error pattern X and Y appearing together in the database and what would be expected if X and Y were statistically dependent. The rationale is to find out how many more units (X and Y together) occur than expected from the independent occurrences. Formula (3) shows the calculation of leverage value.

Leverage = P(X,Y)-P(X)P(Y) (3)  Conviction is interpreted as the ratio of the expected frequency that error pattern X occurs without error pattern Y, which indicates the frequency of making an incorrect prediction by the rule. Formula (4) shows the calculation of conviction value.

Conviction = P(X)P(not Y)/P(X, not Y) (4)  To achieve the purpose of this study, this study used a free software, WEKA, which is developed at the University of Waikato, New Zealand. WEKA was selected as the mining tool, because it offers functions to implement algorithms for classification, clustering, and association rule mining, as well as graphical user interfaces and visualization utilities [14]. After the raw data were transformed, the association rules function of WEKA was used to find the associations between reading error types of the students in each group. The association rules of error type with top 10 confidences for group A, B, and C are presented in Tables 2, 3, and 4 respectively.

The results indicate that the students in different groups made distinctively different reading error patterns.

As shown in Table 2 for group A, the most frequent associate rule [If error 1.4 and 2.4, then Error 3.4] has the confidence of 0.8, indicating that if the students substitute      the finite verb with a conjunction (1.4) and substitute a key word with a preposition (2.4), then they would likely to have problem with dividing clauses (3.4). For group B, the association rule [If error 4.2 and 6.1, then error 3.1] has the highest confidence of 1. The students in group B have more problems with step 4, identifying the subject and main verb.

If they substitute the subject with an object (4.2), and make error of lexical meaning in step 6 (6.1), then they would tend to make mistakes of separating the clause within the same clause (3.1).

If they make mistakes of substituting a finite verb with a modal verb in step 1 (1.2) and omit the subject in step 5 (5.2), then they would likely make lexical errors in step 6 (6.1). According  to the prediction of association rules, if learners make error type X and Y, then they would likely make error type Z. In order to prevent students making the same mistakes, it is therefore suggested to recommend sentences containing error types X, Y and Z for students to practice. The results generated by the association rules function were used to find the most suitable sentences for the students to practice in each group. Based on the results of the association rules, the system is able to recommend reading sentences containing sentences with higher confidences. The clusters of recommended sentences for each group are given in Table 5.

5. Conclusion  In this study we have proposed an English reading recommender system which incorporates identifying engineering students' reading error patterns through data mining. Association rules function was applied to mine possible rules of association of errors among CSA steps.

Based on the association rules, suitable sentences for reading practice can be recommended for each group of students. The association rules indicated that the students in different groups exhibited distinctively different error patterns. In traditional settings of large-scale reading classes, it would be difficult to discover the combinations of reading errors. Most likely the same reading materials would be delivered to different groups of students, without taking their features into consideration. However, adaptive learning is now becoming an unavoidable trend in e-Iearning. This study has shown how data mining techniques can be applied to English reading instruction more adaptive to learner features.
