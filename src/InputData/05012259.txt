Abstract--Due to data forwarding and path selection characteristics based on MAC address, WLAN mesh networks requires additional operations to achieve end-to-end data delivery using IPv6 address. IPv6 neighbor discovery operation in WLAN mesh networks needs repeated all-node broadcasting and this gives rise to a big burden in the entire mesh networks. In this paper, we propose the efficient IPv6 neighbor discovery method in multi-hop WLAN mesh networks. The proposed scheme utilizes the pre-configured proxy neighbor table. It has been shown from simulation experiments that the control overhead and communication setup latency can be significantly reduced using the proposed proxy mechanism.



I. INTRODUCTION  Recently, the number of wireless-enabled devices such as laptops, PDAs, and mobile phones has been growing rapidly.

Together with that, WMN is regarded as a promising wireless technology for numerous applications, e.g., broadband home networking, community networks, and building automation, etc. through its self-configuring and easy-to-setup capabilities.

Even though IEEE 802.11 WMN [1, 3] is regarded as the efficient solution for broadband wireless networks, there has been little consideration for IPv6 protocol interactions with WMN. That is, non-mesh devices in WMN need other node?s MAC address to initiate specific applications. At this time, the IPv6 neighbor discovery control messages [2] may be a big burden in multi-hop WMN due to its flooding delivery feature.

The neighbor solicitation (NS) packet uses all-node broadcasting to obtain the destination?s MAC address.

Moreover, the destination node needs multi-hop path information towards the source node to transmit the neighbor advertisement message as a response of NS message. From this process, flooding-based delivery is repeatedly used and this results in the degradation of network throughput.



II. PROBLEMS: IPV6 OVER WLAN MESH NETWORKS  The basic IPv6 neighbor discovery operation over WLAN mesh networks is shown in Fig. 1. Suppose that the source node (X) must resolve the MAC address of the target node (Y) to send data packets. So, the node X initiates the address resolution (IP to MAC) for target node Y using IPv6 neighbor discovery protocol. The neighbor solicitation (NS) message is distributed within the entire WLAN mesh networks. After receiving the NS message, the target node Y sends back a neighbor advertisement (NA) message to the source node X.

At this time, if the target node Y does not know a path to the     source node X, this requires the target node Y to initiate the path discovery operation towards the node X for NA delivery.

The path request (PREQ) message [1], which is initiated from the target node Y to look for the path to the node X, will be flooded again within the whole networks. On receiving the PREQ message initiated from the node Y, node X replies to the PREQ message by sending out a path reply (PREP) message [1]. Once the node Y receives the PREP, it begins to forward the neighbor advertisement (NA) to the node X using the path obtained from the path discovery operation. After receiving the NA, the source node X can finally start to forward data packets towards the target node Y.

Fig. 1.  Neighbor discovery over WLAN mesh networks   Due to twice flooding operations during path discovery and  neighbor discovery phases (i.e., NS and PREQ messages), the existing scheme brings large amount of control messages as well as long communication setup delay and also gives rise to high consumption of wireless links with bandwidth constraints.



III. PROPOSED PROXY-BASED NEIGHBOR DISCOVERY SCHEME  In the proposed proxy approach, a root portal (RP) node [1] is utilized to execute neighbor discovery mechanism. For this, a RP node periodically announces itself with the portal announcement message that contains the distance metric and a sequence number. Any MPs hearing the portal announcement establish a path to the RP node by using PREQ and PREP- based path establishment primitives.

After constructing the path towards the RP, any MPs wishing to send data packets first ask the RP for MAC address of destination node through the pre-established path to the RP, by using IPv6 neighbor solicitation (NS) message. The RP node hearing the IPv6 NS message from any MPs sends back the response message (i.e., neighbor advertisement) to the initiator node of the NS message. That is, the proposed proxy ND approach does not need any flooding delivery for neighbor discovery request and response messages in WLAN  1  Efficient IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Scheme for Wireless LAN Mesh networks  Jihoon Lee, Samsung Electronics       mesh networks.

The operation of the proxy neighbor discovery approach is largely made of 3 steps. The detailed procedures are as follows.

Step 1. Path configuration towards RP: All MPs hearing the portal announcement message try to configure the path to the RP. For the path establishment towards the RP node, the on- demand path discovery method based on PREQ (Path request) and PREP (Path reply) primitives is utilized.

Step 2. Proxy registration: Each node in WLAN mesh networks sends a proxy registration message to the RP to announce its existence as well as its address binding information (i.e., MAC address and IPv6 address). From the proxy registration, the RP configures the proxy neighbor table for the relation between MAC address and IPv6 address of each node. A non-mesh device first associates with MAP, which is located within its service range, by using standard IEEE 802.11 procedures. Once associated, the MAP initiates a proxy registration procedure on behalf of the device towards the RP. The proxy registration utilizes the pre-established path towards the RP. To do so, it sends a proxy registration request (PRReq) message including MAC address and IPv6 address on behalf of the device, to the RP. The RP thereby learns that the device is being proxied by the MAP as well as MAC address and IPv6 address of the device. The RP may then create a proxy registration reply (PRRep) message which is sent towards the MAP. Once receiving PRRep, MAP configures a proxid address information for the device.

Step 3. Neighbor discovery request and response: When a device wants to send data packets to any other device, it first requests MAC address of the destination node to the RP using neighbor solicitation message if it has no information in its neighbor cache. On receiving the neighbor solicitation message, the RP looks up its proxy neighbor table and sends back the corresponding MAC address to the neighbor discovery initiator node using the neighbor advertisement message. After receiving NA message from the RP, the node can get the MAC address of the destination node and then starts to send data packets.



IV. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION  The performance evaluation was conducted using NS-2 simulator. AODV [4] and HWMP (Hybrid Wireless Mesh routing protocol) [1] are adopted as basic routing protocols, and the proposed proxy scheme is implemented within HWMP protocol. The existing schemes are assumed to adopt the basic neighbor discovery mechanism using multiple all- node broadcasting.

Fig. 2 shows the communication setup latency, i.e., the necessary time the first data packet was able to be transmitted successfully. In Fig. 2, thanks to the reduction of the number of flooding by using the pre-configured proxy neighbor table, the proposed proxy ND scheme can achieve lower communication setup latency than the existing schemes. In the existing schemes, broadcasted PREQ packets contend with NS  packets and therefore the broadcasted packets experience interference with each other. On the other hand, the proposed scheme mitigates mutual interference between neighbor discovery and path discovery as well as concurrent neighbor discoveries. Hence the network becomes more stable, and path discovery latency can be improved.

Fig.2. Communication setup latency as a function of the number of nodes    Fig. 3. Control message packets as a function of the number of nodes   In Fig. 3, as the number of nodes grows, the control  overhead of existing schemes increases more sharply than that of the proposed scheme. This stems from the situation that the existing methods experience one or two times flooding due to NS delivery and PREQ delivery while the proposed method only utilizes unicast delivery for neighbor discovery request and response.



V. CONCLUSION  This paper makes the following points. First, it shows that the difference between the application identifier (i.e., IPv6 address) and routing identifier in WMN (MAC address) requires repeated flooding in the entire networks, and the multiple flooding may result in excessive redundancy, contention, and collision. Second, it presents the proxy-based neighbor discovery method that minimizes network control overhead and reduces communication latency. Using the pre- configured proxy neighbor table, the proposed scheme can reduce the number of flooding delivery during the neighbor discovery process.
