Abstract?We consider the development of an imaging system  consisting of an array of optical apertures for operation over  long atmospheric paths. Typical multi-aperture systems  combine the information collected by the apertures in an  optical manner. In contrast, image formation in our approach  is performed digitally according to the following procedure: (1)  the complex-valued amplitude of the received optical field is  measured synchronously in each aperture pupil-plane and (2)  the data collected are processed digitally in order to synthesize  an image with quality corresponding to the entire aperture of  the imaging system. We report the results of a numerical study  including complex-field sensing strategy, digital compensation  of atmospheric turbulence effects, and correction of alignment  errors of the apertures.
