I. INTRODUCTION Nowadays, GIS systems grow at a very fast pace, and much  of functionality has moved to online services. Geospatial epidemiology is a discipline which benefits from geospatial analysis, but there are few online services suitable for geospatial epidemiology, and their functionality is quite limited.

If spatial epidemiology is enabled in online GIS systems to provide an online, easy-to-use analysis and visualization service, then this would be a useful tool to epidemiologists, as well as to users interested in searching disease maps.

Epidemiology employs a large number of analysis methods that are not easily used without programming. Furthermore, epidemiological analysis requires data related to other disciplines, such as economics, ecology, and demographics, which are not easy to retrieve and employ in the analysis. The system should display results on an interactive map and have the capability to store and compute Big Data.

We present here a spatial epidemiological analysis system based on the TerraFly GeoCloud. This system can provide online analysis with comprehensive main algorithms designed especially for geospatial epidemiology, which are easy to be  used without any programming knowledge. Also, users can employ in the analysis various related datasets from the TerraFly GeoCloud system, such as socioeconomic and demographic data. Further, this system allows users to visualize results on a map. This system can provide distributed storage, allowing users to upload, manipulate, and download data.

This geospatial epidemiology analysis system is based on the TerraFly GeoCloud. It makes use of the TerraFly GeoCloud storage and visualization API, as well as of the Django web framework. The algorithms are implemented using the Python and R languages. Compared with other services and software, this system can provide easy-to use, comprehensive, and friendly spatial epidemiology analysis methods and clear visualization for the benefit of both the spatial epidemiology researcher and of the common user concerned about public health.  The system is available at http://terrafly.fiu.edu/GeoCloud/ .

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present the background of this system. In Section 3 we describe the architecture of the epidemiology analysis system within TerraFly GeoCloud. In Section 4 we present the analysis algorithms and visualization solutions. In Section 5 we present a case study based of lung cancer mortality in Florida, in order to show how to use this system to perform epidemiological analysis. In Section 6 we discuss related software and online services.



II. BACKGROUND  A. Geospatial Epidemiology Geospatial epidemiology is a field of study focused on  describing and analyzing the geographic variations of disease spread. Specifically, geospatial epidemiology considers demographic, environmental, behavioral, socioeconomic, genetic, and infectious risk factors [1]. Geospatial epidemiology has three focus areas: 1. disease mapping, 2.

geographic correlation studies, and 3. clustering, disease clusters, and surveillance.

DOI 10.1109/ICMLA.2013.166    DOI 10.1109/ICMLA.2013.166    DOI 10.1109/ICMLA.2013.166    DOI 10.1109/ICMLA.2013.166        Recent advances in data availability, GIS systems, and analytic methods have created new opportunities for investigators to improve the display of geospatial epidemiology analysis results.

Disease maps, which provide a direct visual summary of complex geographic and disease information, have a long history. In recent years, disease mapping as a fundamental part of disease analysis has attracted a considerable amount of effort.  Disease maps typically include mortality maps, morbidity maps, standardized mortality/morbidity ratio (SMR) maps, age-adjusted ratio maps, etc. The SMR ratio is often shown for geographic areas such as countries, counties, zip codes, or other granularities.  This information guides in understanding which areas have a high risk of disease contagion [6].

The aim of geographic correlation studies is understand the effect of various factors on the spread of diseases. These factors may relate to geography, socioeconomics, demographics, or lifestyle. For example, is lung cancer is related to smoke, or does income affect the risk of a given disease [3][5].

Disease cluster detection attempts to discover those groups that are at higher or lower risk of disease transmission. By analyzing these clusters, researchers can also discover relative factors of the disease. For example, consider people living in a heavy pollution area; they may be subject to a higher disease risk, and they form a cluster that can be detected and analyzed.

Existing disease cluster detection methods include Local Moran?s I[15], Scan statistic[7] and Getis-Ord Gi* statistic[12].

Disease surveillance aims to monitor the spread of disease and to report disease outbreaks.

B. Spatial data visualization Visualization of numerical and symbolic data helps create a  clearer understanding of the data. Visualizations may also provide new ways to interpret data by enabling researchers to recognize patterns. Data can be visualized in many ways, including charts, graphs, images, and tables. Spatial data, or geographic data, contains coordinates, allowing their position in space to be mapped. Coordinates usually represent a position in a two- or three-dimensional plane. Other data fields can then be used in various visualization techniques that display and change the appearance of the mapped spatial data, allowing a quicker understanding and comparison of the different data values. In geospatial epidemiology, visualization of data and of analysis results is important in helping researchers understand the spatial relationships between different areas.

C. TerraFly GeoCloud   Fig. 1. The Architecture of TerraFly GeoCloud  TerraFly GeoCloud[2] is a system combining several diverse technologies and components in order to analyze and visualize geospatial data. Figure 1 depicts the architecture of TerraFly GeoCloud. In this system, a user can upload a spatial dataset and display it using the TerraFly Map API[4]. Datasets can be subsequently analyzed using various functions, such as Kriging, a geo-statistical estimator for unobserved locations, and spatial clustering, which involves the grouping of closely related spatial objects. The results of these spatial analysis functions can then be displayed in charts or other map visualizations. The system is preloaded with several sample data sources, including include demographic census, real estate, disaster data, hydrology, retail, and crime data. The system also supports MapQL, a query language that features an SQL-like syntax to create custom map visualizations.

Various analysis functions related to spatial epidemiology have been integrated into TerraFly GeoCloud. Analysis functions can be used by selecting the appropriate dataset and function in the menu, and selecting the variables to be analyzed. TerraFly GeoCloud then processes the data and returns a result that can be visualized on the TerraFly Map, or on a chart. Results displayed on the map include a legend, which identifies certain range values by color. Certain visualizations are interactive, allowing additional information to be displayed.



III. SPATIAL EPIDEMIOLOGY ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION SYSTEM BASED ON TERRAFLY GEOCLOUD   Fig. 2. The Architecture of the Spatial Epidemiology System  The architecture of the spatial epidemiology system is shown in Fig. 2. This system, based on TerraFly GeoCloud,        provides online spatial epidemiology analysis and visualization services. It makes use of the TerraFly GeoCloud Distributed System for data storage and of the TerraFly GeoCloud Service API in order to provide web services. Through them, users can upload and use datasets, draw maps, and customize spatial data visualizations. GeoCloud contains demographic census and socioeconomic datasets that can be incorporated to the epidemiology analysis.

Our Spatial Epidemiology System provides four kinds of API algorithms for data analysis and results visualization, based on the TerraFly GeoCloud System: disease mapping (mortality/morbidity map, SMR map), disease cluster determination (spatial cluster, HotSpot analysis tool, cluster and outlier analysis), geographic distribution measurement (mean central, median central, standard distance, distributional trends), and regression (linear regression, spatial auto- regression).

The epidemiology web framework can be used to perform data interaction, and the TerraFly GeoCloud API provides a spatial data visualization service to display the results. Web techniques are implemented to provide interaction to the user.



IV. ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION OF SPATIAL EPIDEMIOLOGY  A.  Disease mapping Disease mapping can display disease spread information  on a map and provide a direct summary to users. Disease maps include mortality/morbidity maps, SMR maps, etc. Users can see on maps which areas have higher incidence or mortality.

Our geospatial epidemiology system provides a mortality/morbidity map and an SMR map.

SMR, the standardized mortality ratio, is a ratio or percentage measuring the increase or decrease of mortality in the study subareas with respect to the wide areas. SMR can be calculated as follows:  ? SMRi ? ? ??  ?? ? ????  where Oi is the number of observed disease mortality cases in subarea i, and Ei is the expected number of disease mortality cases in subarea i  Ei  is defined as:  ? ???? ????  ? ? ?	??  where Pi is the population in subarea i, OA is the total number of observed disease mortality cases in the whole area, and PA is the total population in the whole area.

Fig. 3. Standardized Mortality Ratio map  Figure 3 shows a lung cancer SMR map in Florida. Each county has its own SMR. If SMR is close to 1, then the mortality of lung cancer in this county is close to the average mortality in Florida. From this map, users can know which county has lung cancer mortality higher than the average.

B. Clusters Disease Clusters are a common occurrence. Clusters are  abnormal aggregations of disease cases in the same period and in the same place. Discovery and analysis of these clusters can help users understand the disease spread mechanism and control the spread of infectious diseases. Disease cluster detection methods include Openshaw?s GAM, Besag & Newell, Kulldorff & Nagarwalla, and others.

Openshaw?s GAM [11] needs the user to input a radius as argument; the method then scans the area within the circle of the designated radius. The shortfalls of this method include: 1) circles of the same size can refer to different-sized population; 2) it does not account for multiple testing. Besag & Newell [8] needs the user to input the size of the cluster - this is a disadvantage. Kulldorff & Nagarwalla (KN) [7] provides a more accurate method to perform disease cluster detection.

The KN method is implemented for circular zones of variable size, and allows for likelihood ratio test. In our geospatial epidemiology system, the Kulldorff & Nagarwalla (KN) technique was chosen to perform disease cluster detection.

The steps of the KN method include: 1. Move a circle in space to obtain an infinite number of overlapping circles; 2.

Compute LLR (Log Likelihood Ratio) of each circle and sort the LLRs; 3. Obtain a large LLR, then use the Monte Carlo method to calculate their P-value. The Log Likelihood Ratio can be calculated as follows:  ? LLR = maxj? ? ??  ?? ??? ?  ?????  ????? ?????? ? Yj >Ej)? ????  where Yj denotes the observed number of deaths in the circle subarea, Y+ denotes the number of deaths in the entire area, and? Ej denotes the expected number of deaths in circle subarea.

Fig. 4. Disease cluster map  Figure 4 shows a lung cancer cluster map in Florida. The red points indicate disease clusters where unusual disease cases were detected. The number in the red point is the p- value of each area.

Besides the disease cluster, the system also provides HotSpot analysis function, and Cluster and Outlier Analysis.

C. Regression Secondary dataset correlation may be used in  epidemiologic analysis, for example: as socioeconomic data.

Regression tools provide employ regression models to estimate the relationships between disease data and secondary datasets, such as socioeconomic data. [10]  Regression models include linear regression and spatial auto regression. In linear regression, Moran's I Test is added to test whether the dataset contains spatial correlation. In spatial auto-regression, a lag model and an error model are provided. The spatial auto-regression lag model can be calculated as follows:  Y = ?Wy + x? +?                                (4)  where Y is a dependent variable, W is a matrix of spatial weights, x is an independent variable, ? denotes the unknown parameters, and ? is an error term.

Fig. 5. Spatial auto-regression lag model  Figure 5 shows the result of a spatial auto-regression lag model. In this model, multiple test methods are provided for verifiability: Wald test to determine whether various parameters can be zero or not; AIC for linear regression and lag model, to indicate which model is better; LR test, the Likelihood Ratio diagnostics, for spatial dependence; LM test, for absence of spatial autocorrelation in lag model residuals [13][14].

D.  Measuring Geographic Distribution Geographic distribution measurements include  mean/median central, standard distance, and distributional trends functions. In our system, a weighted mean central is provided as follow:  X = ? ????? ? ???  Y= ? ????? ? ???  (5)  where xi and yi denote the coordinate of each point (but when the data set is polygonal,  xi and yi indicate the center of each polygon) and wi is the weight - which corresponds in our system to mortality or incidence.

Fig. 6. Center point and weighted center point  Figure 6 shows these two points: one is the non-weighted center point, and the other is the lung cancer mortality weighed center point. They do not coincide.



V. A CASE STUDY In this section we provide an example of how our  geospatial epidemiology system can be employed in epidemiologic research. Assume a researcher studies lung cancer in Florida. She can upload and choose the mor_price_income dataset to TerraFly GeoCloud - shown in Figure 7.

Fig. 7. Datasets in TerraFly GeoCloud  Center point Weighed center point        She can then choose the disease analysis button to draw a disease map. In this function, she can choose a legend group number; a disease map is displayed then, as shown in Figure 8.

Fig. 8. Lung cancer disease map  From Figure 8 we see how this map, with legend at the top left corner, gives a direct summary of the disease data. For lung cancer in Florida, the mortality in the central region is higher and in the south is lower. However, the researcher cannot have an accurate analysis just from this one map. She can further choose the cluster and outliner function, which uses Local Moran?s I to perform further analysis. This function provides three maps: local Moran?s I map, z-value map, and p-value map. Figure 9 shows the p-value map, from which the researcher can know which counties form a statistically significant cluster and which counties are statistically significant outliners.

Fig. 9. P-value map of Local Moran I  Now the researcher may want to know what kind of relationship there is between lung cancer mortality and the median income of each county. For this purpose, she can use the median income dataset provided by the GeoCloud system, and apply to it the spatial auto-regression tool. Figure 10 shows  the result of this model. From the result, we learn that when the mortality of surrounding areas increase by 1, the mortality of this county will increase of 0.233, and when the median income in the surrounding area increases by $10,000, the mortality of this county will decrease of 0.09.

VI. RELATED WORK AND PRODUCTS Related software systems come in three categories: public  health information providers, geo-statistic analytics, and survey analytics. A public health information provider dispenses disease maps and provides simple analysis functions.

The dataset is fixed: users can neither upload their own datasets, nor perform complex analysis, such as cluster detection or regression.

ArcGIS and SaTScan are geo-statistic analytics software.

ArcGIS spatial analyst does not provide an online service, nor does it aim at spatial epidemiology. SaTScan is used for spatial epidemiology, but the result is text only, and cannot be displayed as a map.

EPI Info is a well-respected survey analytics software that provides very good data analysis based on surveys. While featuring simple data visualization, it only provides limited geographic data analysis functions; it does not provide any online service.

The system is interfaced with our Health Informatics projects [16-23].

VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK Our geospatial epidemiology system provides an important  contribution to medicine and public health. It combines geospatial epidemiology and GIS technology, delivering analytics and user-friendly data visualization. This system provides comprehensive analysis methods, which are simple to use without any programming knowledge for spatial epidemiology. It also provides background datasets that may be of interest for epidemiologists. Our system leverages the map API provided by TerraFly GeoCloud in order to display the results of analysis; the distributed storage system allows users to upload their datasets, perform complex calculations online, and download the results.

Our future work includes implementing additional spatial methods for epidemiology, such as a spatial temporal cluster tool and point maps.
