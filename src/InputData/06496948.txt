Multi-Service Data Dissemination for Space-based Augmentation Systems

Abstract? New SBAS (Satellite Based Augmentation System) signals could include the provision of new additional services alongside the defined SBAS L1/L5 aeronautical service [1], if additional power becomes available. In this paper we present a solution that efficiently makes use of the additional available power in order to increase the overall data rate of a new multi- service SBAS signal. These new SBAS signals will be backward compatible. The high power efficiency of the proposed scheme is guaranteed by a variation of the interplex scheme that is characterized by a variable envelope signal constellation. A coding scheme based on generalized low density parity check (LDPC) codes ensures that service requirements can be met with a lower SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio).
