Abstract?We propose to utilize a previously developed, deployed, and clinically tested comprehensive visual field test and diagnosis system to investigate the relationship between intracranial pressure (ICP) and intraocular pressure (IOP) elevations that occur during long-term space travel and visual field loss. Recent data describing this phenomenon, now called the Visual Impairment/Intracranial Pressure (VIIP) Syndrome raise concerns that it could impact the visual health of astronauts both during long-duration space travel, potentially causing an impact to the mission, and after flight, causing significant morbidity. A non-invasive, easily-deployable, user- friendly visual field test system can provide early detection of changes in vision in flight as well as a screening and research tool to help develop countermeasures to prevent/alleviate this problem and to identify at-risk astronauts.
