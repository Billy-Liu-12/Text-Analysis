Geovisualization of knowledge diffusion A case study in data minin

Abstract?The diffusion of knowledge and technology is a complex spatial process. Using geovisualization technology to visualize and analyze diffusion and dissemination of knowledge from the spatial view is of great value. Selecting the field of data mining as research subjects, we bring forward a new way to visualize knowledge diffusion of SCI papers based on the combination of scientometrics and geovisualization technology. Through converting relevant factors of knowledge diffusion into feature layers, we can use all kinds of thematic maps to visualize the factors and process of knowledge diffusion. Based on it, we find some interesting result of knowledge diffusion in this field. It shows the method is helpful to discover the law of knowledge diffusion and will lay the foundation for further studying of data mining.

I. INTRODUCTION  Visualization is a powerful strategy for integrating high- level human intelligence and knowledge into the KDD process [1]. Graphics provide an excellent visually approach for exploring data and are essential for presenting results [2], and has got a wide variety of applications in many fields.

Gaining insight and constructing knowledge demand careful consideration of how the data is to be displayed or visually encoded [3]. But some problems may comprise many more data dimensions than what can be displayed simultaneously using conventional methods, or indeed than what can be analyzed with current parametric statistical techniques [4].

The diffusion of knowledge and technology is such a problem. It is an importance problem in the fields of scientometrics, but most of the researches concentrating on statistical authors, keywords, citation and so on [5], while failing to give sufficient attention to the spread of geographical space of these knowledge and technologies. In fact, the dissemination of knowledge and technology is a geographic process [6]. Existing studies have shown that spatial distance is the primary impact on knowledge and technology diffusion [7]; scientific collaboration networks, and other social network have a close link with geographical space [8].

But, it is not very helpful to add the map simply in many cases. For example,  if we only simply add the travel path of knowledge to the geographic base map, as the diffusion  process progresses, the paths become more and more, thus it is difficult to identify each other and even harder for researchers to find out valuable disciplines inside them. As shown in Figure 1.

Consequently, it is important to find a way to geovisualize the feature and process of knowledge and technology diffusion. Based on scientometrics and GIS Visualization technology, we propose a method to implement spatial visualization of knowledge and technology diffusion so as to provide the basis for further analysis and research.



II.   DATA PRE-PROCESSING  We choose data mining and other related literature in the SCI database as our research data source. The SCI database is the most frequently used and highly authoritative database in the research of Bibliometrics [9]. Data mining and its synonyms (such as data mine, KDD, exploratory data analysis, information discovery, information extraction, intelligent data analysis etc.) were used as the search topics.

All the information was obtained on July, 16th, 2008 when the SCI search process for this study was conducted. The total number of papers related to data mining research in the ISI web database was 10286, after deleting the repeated records, the total number was 9808, which were published between 1962 and 2008. These were published with 13  document types with the distribution analysis. There were 8930 regular/research articles, which accounted for 91.07% of the total production, followed by reviews (303; 3.09%), meeting abstract (214; 2.18%), editorial materials (194; 1.97%), book review(78; 0.8%), letter (26; 0.27%),news items (14; 0.14%), note(14; 0.14%), correction (9; 0.09%), Biographical-Item (5; 0.05%)and reprint (2; 0.02%).

In scientometrics research, keywords are often selected to identify the diffusion of knowledge and technology [10].

There are 32968 keywords in all the data mining literature.

Among them, we selected 50 keywords with highest frequency as our object of study. The 50 keywords are: clustering, classification, machine learning, Knowledge Discovery, association rules, information extraction, exploratory data analysis, bioinformatics, neural networks, decision trees, feature selection, pattern recognition, rough sets, genetic algorithms, information retrieval, text mining, visualization, genetic algorithm, database, neural network, algorithms, support vector machines, gene expression, cluster analysis, knowledge discovery in database, microarray, fuzzy sets, privacy, self-organizing map, time series, intrusion detection, feature extraction, Web mining, principal component analysis, artificial neural networks, data visualization, data warehouse, fuzzy logic, natural language processing, association rule mining, knowledge     management, sequential patterns, artificial intelligence, ontology.

By processing contact addresses of corresponding authors in original data, we obtained all the residential city of the authors. According to the statistical result, there are 788 cities which are involved in our study. We marked these cities on map, inputted their corresponding name, and saved the results into city as a separate layer after geo-coding. On the other hand, we establish a keywordSet table, which record the keywords? relevant information, such as the papers? name, the year, the authors, the authors? residential city, the publication etc.

Through geo-coding, we can establish a linkage between the points in layer city and records in keywordSet table.

After that, it is convenient for us to generate the required thematic layer and do the geovisualization analysis based on the data.



III. METHODS  In order to study the law of knowledge diffusion, we need to describe the generation, spread process and distribution status of these technologies. Through selecting appropriate layer data, we use GIS visualization method to spatially present the distribution status, innovation center, research trends and other related information in this study.

A. Research Distribution Visualization  To some extent, the accumulated number of published paper in a city reflects its level of activity in scientific research. Consequently, the cities with a large cumulative number of published papers can be regarded as ?research center? of its kind. In this study, we got the statistics of each city?s and country?s total published paper number in the field of data mining, and make use of the GIS technology to draw thematic maps, as shown in Figure 2. In the figure, a greater dot notation indicates a larger number of publications of a city, and the deeper the blue is indicates a larger number of publications of a country. It shows in the map that the United States and China are the two countries with the most research concentration, and Hong Kong, Beijing, Seoul, Singapore, Taipei, New York, London are the most highly productive cities. We also notice in the map that there are focus areas of data mining research in Europe and the mid- east United States. While in Asia, the research concentration only falls on several single cities despite of the large number of publications in these countries.

Through dividing time into four stages (1991-1995 1996-2000 2001-2005, 2006-2008)and processing statistical number of published papers in each stage, we obtained the individual publication situation of the four stages and save the result into four feature layers. As shown in Figure 3. The map indicates that research of data mining firstly emerged in some European and North American cities, and it was not until 1996 that East Asia became important research area in this field. Accordingly, the cities with most publications turned from Beer Sheva, Regina, London (1991-1995) to Hong Kong (1996-2000), Beijing (2001-  2005) and Seoul (2006-2008).

B. Innovation Center Analysis  In scientific research, the innovation achievements are often more important than the mere number of publication.

We obtained the statistics of the cities in which the selected 50 keywords first appeared, and then ranked these cities in accordance with the frequency of the first-appeared keywords. The cities with a better ranking indicate that they more easily tend to generate and accept new concepts and ideas, which are the major sources of innovative ideas and technologies in the research area.

Similarly, we displayed the cities with classification according to the number of first-appeared keywords. In Figure 4 it shows that some of the large ?research centers? quietly disappeared from this map, the city survived are mainly in the United States and Europe, which are the traditional academic areas. As shown below, San Jose, Denver, Porvo, London, Beer Sheva are cities which can be considered as innovation center.

If we produce a superimposed layer of innovation cities and research cities, we can find some more interesting phenomenon. That is, most of the innovation centers in the United States are not the ones with the most publications, while although many Asian cities have a large number of publication, they typically show less innovation achievement.

European cities are somewhere in between. As shown in Figure 5.

C. Knowledge Diffusion process Visualization  Keywords in scientific literature generally indicate key technologies applied in the research [11]. As mentioned above, the spatial distribution of researches could be studied through spatial statistics, which aims at analyzing the number of the same keywords of different cities. Further, if we add the time dimension for each city, we could study the spatial diffusion of the keywords. As a result, we can study the spatial diffusion of related knowledge (technologies) by selecting suitable keywords.

However, how to visualize the diffusion phenomenon might be a problem. As shown below, Traditional approaches typically connect the cities involved in knowledge diffusion process by line segments. Yet, with the passage of time, spatial line segments will increase more andmore so that it?s hard for researches to find out laws through this.

After testing several methods, we find that it is relatively a better choice to represent the passage of time by color. As shown in Figure 6, dots and areas with deeper color  represent cities and countries which get earlier involved in using the clustering technology. The map indicates that several cities, mainly in the United States, made the greatest  contribution in the early research of clustering technology before 2000. They include Pilani (India), Londonderry (UK), and (the rest are American cities) Wellington, Madison, Redmond, Redwood Shores, Ithaca, Seattle. And then the research cities spread out in the world     but still keep concentration in United States and Europe. The diffusion also seems highly pertinent to spatial distance - when a city begins to use clustering technology, shortly later the surrounding cities start to use this technology too. It leads to the spatial concentration of corresponding research in the technology. This phenomenon is very obvious in Europe and the United States. We obtained similar result in the study of other related technology in the field of data mining.



IV. CONCLUSION  Aiming at solving the difficult problem in knowledge diffusion, this paper proposes a method of combining scientometrics and geovisualization technology to visualize related factors of knowledge diffusion in spatial dimension, so that it will provide convenience to observe and analyze the trend and result of knowledge diffusion. Taking a case study in data mining, we undertook research in how to construct thematic map layer using original SCI data, then solved the technical problems in generating the thematic maps, and finally obtained a series of interesting results. Our study shows that using this method, we can overcome the deficiency in traditional scientometric research, and make it easier for researchers to discover the hidden information in large amount of data, as well as provide convenience in follow-up study. Therefore, this method deserves a further and deeper value of research.
