On Local Pruning of Association Rules Using Directed Hypergraphs

Abstract  In this paper we propose an adaptive local pruning method for association rules. Our method exploits the ex- act mapping between a certain class of association rules, namely those whose consequents are singletons and back- ward directed hypergraphs (B-Graphs). The hypergraph which represents the association rules is called an Asso- ciation Rules Network(ARN). Here we present a simple ex- ample of an ARN. In the full paper we prove several prop- erties of the ARN and apply the results of our approach to two popular data sets.

1. Introduction  It is widely recognized that the support-confidence framework for association rule (AR) generation typi- cally results in a large number of rules which can ham- per the knowledge discovery process. Several solutions have been proposed to reduce the number of rules gener- ated [1]. However we term all these solutions as global as they are carried out in isolation without any refer- ence to user goals or focus on target items of inter- est. In this paper we propose a ?local? adaptive solution where rule pruning is carried out in the context of pre- cise goals.

2. Example  Let us start with the following rule discovered from a census data of elderly people in the United States :  ?? ? immigrant=no? income=below50k  By itself this rule appears to contradict our general percep- tion, at least in the United States. However by combining this pattern with the rule  ?? ? sex=female ? age ? ??? immigrant=no  provides a context which helps in interpreting the first rule. This forms a network which flows into the goal(income=below50k) and provides a better explana- tion of the goal as opposed to when the rule ?? is viewed in isolation. Now consider a third rule  ?? ? immigrant=no? sex=female  Clearly this rule ?flows in the opposite direction?, is redun- dant and does not help explain the goal. Graphically this rule participates in a cycle with rule ??. Finally consider two more rules  ?? urban=no? income=below50k ?? urban=no? sex=female  sex = female  urban = no  age < 75  immigrant = no  income = below50K  r  r  r  r r       Figure 1. A B-graph representing the rules ?? ? ??. After the removal of rules ?? and ??, this graph is called an Association Rules Net- work  Thus a collection of association rules can be synthesized into an Association Rules Network (ARN). In the full paper [1] we describe an algorithm to construct an ARN, prove several properties and illustrate their use on real data sets.
