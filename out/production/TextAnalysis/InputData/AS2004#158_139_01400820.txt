Abstract - A concept hierarchy is a kind of concise and general form of knowledge representations. Concept description is vague for human knowledge generally. Crisp description for a concept usually cannot represent human knowledge completely and practically. In this poper, we will study fuzzy characteristics of concept description and propose an agglomerative clustering scheme based on f izzy theory to generate hierarchicalhzzy concepts@om a large database automatically. The proposed method first transfonns quantitative data into linguistic terms using h z z y  membership functions. The f izzy entropy is then designed for evaluating the signifcant order of attributes and a clustering algorithm is developed to find meaningful fizzy concept hierarchies effectively.

Many techniques have been developed to mine useful knowledge from databases in the research area of knowledge discovery. The objective of knowledge discovery is to examine how to extract knowledge automatically from huge database or training data. The discovered knowledge from a large practical database can be applied to many applications, such as decision-making, marketing, information management, and so on. For different applications, the different types of knowledge lead to lots of methodologies in the development of data mining techniques [4]. For example, the Apriori algorithm for miniig association rules [l], classification leaming algorithms for decision trees construction [lo] and unsupervised leaming algorithms for clusters generation [7]. Regardless of the mining approaches involved, we can imagine the various types of discovered knowledge as the concepts leamed from databases based on different viewpoints.

Representing mined knowledge to users is also an important research topic. The discovered knowledge can be Chih-Hung Hu and Stem-J Hsu Department of Information Engineering, I-Shou University Kaohsiung 840, Taiwan, R.0.C m9203007@stmail.isu.edu.tw represented as various types of form such as association rules, decision trees, and so on. The concept hierarchy is a kind of concise and general form of concept description for representing knowledge. Many knowledge representations are variants of concept hierarchies in different ways of expression. For transaction databases, as an example, association rules are the set of rules that describe the relative relationships of large item sets in a partial ordering hierarchy. A concept hierarchy is a tree-like structure that each level of the hierarchy is a sequence of mapping from a set of low-level specific concepts to a set of high-level general concepts, as the example shown in Figure 1. The  most general concept in the root is a universal concept, whereas the most specific concepts correspond to the specific values of amibutes in the database. Each internal node in the tree of concept hierarchy represents a concept which helps to express knowledge and data relationships in a database.

Traditional concept hierarchies usually reprcsent knowledge using crisp concept description. Hows:ver, concept description for human knowledge is vague generally and' a crisp description of concept cannot represent human knowledge completely. For a concept, fuzzy description should be more appropriate than (crisp description in real world. For example, in Figure 2, a tomato is a kind of fruits and a tomato is also a kind of vegetables. A fuzzy concept hierarchy reflects the fact that an object or a concept can belong to more than one Mgh- level concept with different membership degrees. Fuzzy concept hierarchies had been applied to data summarkition [XI and the mining of association rules [9].

For constructing concept hierarchies, many difixent methods have been developed. The fust kind of methods is to specify concept hierarchies by users, experts or data analysts according to a partial or total ordering semautics of attributes explicitly at the schema level. Another kirid of methods is that given a set of attributes, the system can then hy to generate the partial ordering of attributes automatically so as to construct a meaningful comept hierarchy [4]. The thud kind of methods is to defiae a portion of a concept hierarchy by clustering explicit data in databases. However, it is essentially unrealistic to define an entire concept structure by explicit values enumeration manually in a large database. Thus, most ofmethods ol'this kind focus on automatic generation of concepts by grouping data using clustering techniques. The related researches include Cluster12 by Michalski and Stepp I:lO], COBWEB by Fisher [3], hierarchical and parallel clustering by Hong and Mao [ 5 ] ,  etc. We also proposed an approach [2] based on rough entropy to generate concept hierarchies automatically for a given data set with categorical attributes. Without knowledge of data semantics, generating a meaning concept hierarchy h m  a large database is a challenge.

Most of the previous methods of constructing concept hierarchies generate crisp concept hierarchies. However, fuzzy knowledge representations or fuzzy rules are clften considered in real applications. The method to find fiuzy knowledge is an importaut task. The aim of this paper is to discuss fuzzy characteristics of clustering data and to generate hierarchical fuzzy concepts from a large database automatically. We propose an agglomerative clustering scheme based on fuzzy theory that first transtirms quantitative data into fuzzy linguistic terms using fiuzy membership functions. A fuzzy entropy is then designed for evaluating the importance of attributes. Based on the designed fuzzy entropy, we propose an efficient hierarchical clustering algorithm to remove a weak relevant attribute and group strong relevant concepts recursively for generating a fuzzy concept hierarchy.

The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2: we introduce the structure of fuzzy concept hierarchy and the fuzzy entropy. In Section 3, we presented the proposed clustering algorithm based on fuzzy entropy for generating fuzzy concept hierarchy. In Section 4, we give an example to help understanding the algorithm. Finally, conclusions and future work are discussed in Section 5.

Figure 3. Representation of a fuzzy concept hierarchy.

At fmt, we defme a fuzzy concept hierarchy (FCH) formally in the following. A hierarchical representation of fuzzy concept is illustrated as Figure 3, suppose that a hierarchy His  defmed on a set of domains Dl, .... D, and a { C: . Ci . . . . .  C!, } denotes the set of concepts at the sequence of mapping Hi 3 H,., 3 ... 3 Ho, where H, = primitive level with m attributes in domains {Dl x ... x Dm) and Hi.i = { Ci-', C;-', .... C!,? ) denotes the set of concepts at one level higher than those at H/. Assume that is a fuzzy set defioed on domain Di with the linguistic terms {til, tu, _ _ _  }, pg is the membership values in fi corresponding to the fuzzy term t,. The fuzzy set pican be represented as pi = c c V  Itg = pillti, +p&amp; + .... The k-th fuzzy concept in level 1 is defmed as Ci = @I, pz, ... pi) and we can give the sets of fuzzy terms with strong membership grades in the fuzzy sets pj to represent the fuzzy concept of C i ,  called the representative concept RCL . For the relationships between the concept CL-' and its subordinate concept CL. , theff CL-' , CL.) stauds for the degree of subsuming the concept CL, under the concept of CL-' . Ho represents the most general concept on the top level denoted as "ANT'.

2.2 Fuzzy Entropy For evaluating the importance of attributes on the given data set X, we design a function of fuzzy entropy based on fuzzy set theory. Let X = {xl, x2, ... , x,,) he a non-empty finite set of objects with a non-empty fmite set of attribute A= {Al, , , , , Ak, , . . , Am).  p j  denotes a fuzzy set ofA, containing a set of linguistic terms ( t j l ,  fjz, ... }. We defme the fuzzy entropy E(A) as follows: Definition 1: Let x E X, the fuzzy entropy of information based on a set of attributes A is where pi , (x)  is the membership value of the object x on thej-th linguistic term of i-th attrihute fq and vq is equal to the summation of pq ( x )  for all x E X, that is v.. 'I = &amp; ( x ) .

ItX As we defmed in Definition 1, the fuzzy entropy has monotonic property described as follows.

Theorem 1: Let B, B' c_ A .  If B ' d ,  then E(B) 2 E@') Proof. The values of fuzzy entropy E(B')= ~ x p i , ( x ) x ~ o g l - .  n V .  ~~XA,GB'~,, p ,  1 Since B' c B, trivially, we have E(B') 5 E@).

The concept is more general while the value of fuzzy entropy is smaller. Theorem 1 states the property that the fuzzy entropy decreases monotonously in accord with the generalization in higher levels of a fuzzy concept hierarchy.

3 The algorithm of generating hierarchical fuzzy concept In this section, an algorithm of generating a concept hierarchy for a database with general attributes is proposed.

The symbols used in the proposed algorithm are defined in Section 3.1. In Section 3.2, we describe the computation of subordinate relationships and representative of fuzzy concepts. The proposed algorithm is described in Section 3.3.

3.1 Notations in the following.

We give the computation of the value f( CL-' , CL. ) for CL-' , Ci, that have the set of reduced attribute B in level (-1: where pij(CL) is the membership value of the fuzzy concept C: on the j-th linguistic term of i-th attribute, t.

The IBI is the number of B in level l-1. As the described in Section 2.1, we defme the representative concept RCL = (rLl ,..., r&amp; ,..., r; , ) ,  where rb is the linguistic term with the maximum membership value max{ pq(C;) ) of the fuzzy set pi on the fuzzy concept CL 3.3 The proposed hierarchy generating algorithm The algorithm for generating a meaningful fuzzy concept hierarchy with respect to a given database is described in the following eight main steps: Input: A database Xwith the set of attributes A Output: A fuzzy concept hierarchy H Step 1: Transform the objects x E X with quantitative attributes into linguistic terms using the dehed fuzzy sets p; and fuzzy membership functions.

Step 2: Initialize the value m' = 1.41, Step 3:Generate the lowest level of fuzzy concept hierarchy H, with the set of attributes A .  That is, H,= {Cy ,  CT, ... , Cnm} ,where C: = (p,, p2, . . . , A) and p; is the i-th fuzzy set of attribute Ai. The representative concepts of H ,  are RC: = ( r z  ,..., r{ ,.._, rc) for 1 5 k &lt; n.  Let the initial set of reduced attributes set B = A .

Step4:Let IBI be the number of attributes in the set of reduced attributes B, we set m' = IB/ - 1. Find P&amp;), which is the set of all possible subsets with m' attributes in the set of reduced attributes B.

Step 5:Compute the fuzzy entropy E(Bj) for all Bj E P,.(B).

Step 6:Generate a higher level of fuzzy concept hierarchy 6.1) Find B' = Bfwherej'=arg{min{E(Bj)}}, for Bj E P,,,@); then generate new representative concepts RCT' in H,. The RCT' is obtained by merging the same representative concepts in the lower level H,,+, .

6.2) For the representative concepts RC:', genfrate the corresponding fuzzy concept C:'= (p,, k ,  . . .

pi, .,. , A), where p; has the minimum of membership grade for the merged filzzy concepts with the same representative concepts in Step 6.1.

6.3) For the remainder unchanged fuzzy concept in H,,+, is directly added into H,,,..

Step 7:Calculate the degree of subordinate relationships A Cg',  C g ' )  between each pair of concepts in H,, and H,w.

and H,w.

Step &amp;Let the set of reduced attributes B = B'. If B # 0, then go to Step 4; otherwise, output all levels ofthe fuzzy concept hierarchy Ho, . , ., H,.

The time complexity of the proposed algorithm is dependent on the number of attributes m in each concept level. The number of attributes is decreased after a new level is generated. Hence, the overall time complexity of H,. by the following sub-steps: j the algorithm is bounded by 0 (m2n), where n is the size of the database.

4 Anexample We give an example to explain the above algorithm more clearly. Assume that the example uses the weather data set with 14 objects as shown in Table 1. Let X =  {x,, x2, ..., XM}, A = {outlook, temperahue, humidity, windy, play} .  The decision attribute is @lay}. The symbolic categories in the five attributes, respectively, are: 0 outlook (sunny, overcast, rainy}, 0 temperature: numeric 0 humidity: numeric 0 windy: {true, false}, 0 play: {yes, no}.

We start the steps: Table 1. The weather dataset.

Output: The fuzzy concept hierarchy H.

Step 1: Transform the objects x E X with quantitative attributes into linguistic terms using fuzzy membership functions as Figure 4.

Step 2: Initialize the values of m'= 1.41 = 5 .

Step 3: Generate the lowest level of concept hierarchy H,,, with the set of attributes A .  Let B= {outlook, temperature, humidiy, windy, p lay) ,  Thus, H5 = C: v Ci U ... v Cf4 , that C: =((O/O+OR+l/S), (I/H+O/M+O/L), (0.65/H+ 0.35/L), (OIT+lR), (ON+l/N)) Ci =((O/O+OR+1/S), (0.5/H+O.SIM+O/L), (0.81/H +0.19/L), ( I I T + O I F ) ,  (O/Y+I/N)) C:, =(O/O+l/R+O/S), (O/H+O.641M+O.36/L), (0.84 Step 4: We set m' = IBI - 1 = 4. Find P4 (E), which is the set of all possible subsets with 4 attrihutes in the set of reduced attributes B. P@) = {B,, B2, E,, E4, E 5 ) , where {B, )  = {temperature, humidity, windy, play} , { E 2 }  = (outlook, humidiv, windy, play) , {B3} = {outlook, femperature, windy, plqv) , {B4) = {outlook, temperature, humidiy, play), {BSI = {outlook, temperature, humidity, windy).

H4 by the following three sub-steps: 6.1) E(B,) is the minimum of E(BJ for Ej E P4 (B), E'=&amp;; then generate new representative concepts in H4: RC," is merged fromRC: and RC; , C: is merged from RC; and RC:, . The values of RC;' and RC; are showed in Table 3.

6.2) For the representative concepts generate the corresponding fuzzy concept. For example: RC," is merged from RC: and RC; . Hence, C:=(*, min(O/H, 0.5RI)+min(0.64M, 0.5M) +min(0.36/L,O/L), min(O.84/H, O.Sl/H) +min(O.l6/L, 0.19/L), min(l/T, UT)+    min(O/F, OR), min(ON,OiY)+ min(l/N, W).

Step 6: Generate a higher level of fuzzy concept hierarchy The values of C," are showed in Table 3 6.3) For the remainder unchanged concepts in the H5, is directly added into H4. Thus H4 = c:uc:uc:uc:uc:uc:uc,'uc:,uc:4 uc:uc;.

Step 7: Calculate the subordinate relationships between each pair of concepts in H4 and Hs. For example: n (l-]&amp;)-&amp;)~) AisB WJ, = 0.81 I B'l f(C;,C:) = Step 8: The new set of reduced attributes is B = B' = (temperature, humidiy, windy, play). Because /E( = 4, then go to Step 4.

The final result is shown in Figure 5 and Table 3. We only show the strong subordinate relationships in Figure 5 .

5 Discussions and conclusions Knowledge discovely from a large database is an important research topic of late years. The concept hierarchy is an explicit representation of knowledge and can be widely used in many applications. In this paper, we present the structure of fuzzy concept hierarchy and propose an algorithm for generating the hierarchy based on fuzzy entropy. The algorithm can construct a meaningful fuzzy concept hierarchy automatically and represent fuzzy concepts with representative concepts and different grades of subsuming relationships among subordinate fuzzy concepts. The future work includes making experiments to evaluate the performance of fuzzy concept and labeling the significant concept from the hierarchy.
