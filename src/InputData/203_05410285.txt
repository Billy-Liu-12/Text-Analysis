Design and Implementation of Web-based DSS for Online Shopping Mall

Abstract? Online shopping mall is emerging as a main marketing channel. The web-based decision support system (DSS) in Web 2.0 is constructed to facilitate customers to share profiles and comments. Recommendation system is designed to cluster the customers and products respectively, and produce some association rules between customers and products. These have enabled the system to trigger consumer buying behavior.

Our study proposes a conceptual DSS framework for online shopping mall, involves the search engine as an external layer while the recommendation system as an internal layer. Based on this framework, a solution entitled CommercePro adopts SNS characteristics and logistics regression techniques is developed.

This paper illustrates its implementation and experimental result.



I. INTRODUCTION  With more than 30 years? development in Internet, e- commerce and online shopping mall are getting popular world wide. The latest report [1] from China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC) released on January 2009 showed that, more than 22.6% of Chinese population accessed Internet in 2008, which is a little higher than global average, 21.9%. During this population, 24.8% of them took part in e-commerce in the past year. These statistical data proved that, e-commerce is emerging as a main marketing channel.

Considering trading partners as the category criteria, e- commerce is grouped into four types, i.e. B2B, B2C, C2B and C2C. Table I illustrates the relationships between busi- ness and consumer. As same as usual commerce, the e- commerce subjects to buyer-seller model, also known as con- sumer buying behavior model. The works in [2] and [3] listed six fundamental stages of consumer buying behavior. These six stages consist of need identification, product brokering, merchant brokering, negotiation, purchase and delivery, prod- uct service and evaluation. Our study emphasizes that, to  This work was supported by Information Creative Platform of ?985? Project (Phase II), Xiamen University.

improve the performance of these stages, we can combine the novel characteristics of Web 2.0 into Decision Support System(DSS). For example, by collecting and analyzing the customer?s profile and search history, our study achieves a good result in ?need identification? stage, which aims to distinguish the requirement of customers.

The product presentation layout is related closely with the consumer?s buying custom, hence, it is recognized as a new categorization standard, which not only divides the e- commerce into four groups but also reflects its development trend. Fig.1 presents and explains our categorization results.

According to this trend, the successive stages provides easier and quicker product search mechanisms than the previous ones. This improvement leads consumer to a better purchas- ing experience. Recommendation system (RS) is adopted in our study to satisfy this improvement. The input of RS are customer?s interests, favorites, profiles, search and pur- chase history, and comments for products, while output are product-customer association learning rules or recommended products. It is a specific application in web-based DSS [4]- [5].

Our study proposes a solution for online shopping mall entitled CommercePro. This solution has been applied to several business cases which have achieved meaningful re- sults, such as Diapers.com, Geilla.com, JagajagaMall.com and cnimages.com, etc. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section II reviews the development history of web applications and DSS. Section III describes the conceptual architectural of web-based DSS and external DSS. Section IV presents a logistic regression algorithm for internal DSS.

Section V illustrates the implementation of CommercePro solution. Section VI shows the experimental results of Com- mercePro solution. In the final section, conclusions and future work are presented.

II. LITERATURE REVIEW  A. The development of web application  The rapid development of Internet provides a huge foun- dation for web application. Barry et al. summarized the history of Internet in [6], where they drew its timeline clearly.

Email application is counted as the first web application from 1992. From then on, Netscape developed the first browser to drive the PC users from desktop to internet. More and more browsers occur to provide a new way to access remote data and to get the fresh news. In that period, the materials in Internet were only provided by Internet Content Provider (ICP). Hence, they are one-way flow and read-only. Actually, there is not a formally definition for Web 1.0 before the term ?Web 2.0? is used.

Tim O?REILLY and his team produced the term ?Web 2.0? in 2004. It was first defined in academic paper [7] published in 2007. There are still many arguments about the definition, boundary and contents of web 2.0. But a basic agreement is, Web 2.0 is a platform for various web services which encourages users to contribute web site contents, also known as network effects [8].

It is very confused and interesting that, web 3.0 has been proposed while web 2.0 is still unclearly defined. O?Lassila et al. proposed a concept of ?Web 3.0? in 2007 [9]. In this paper, web 3.0 is regarded as a semantic web. Semantic web is a vision of information that is understandable by computers, so that they can perform more of the tedious work involved in finding, sharing, and combining information on the web. In this sense, it is an ?intelligent agent? [10].

To give a whole comprehension on web application gen- erations, we tabulate them into Table II.

B. The development of DSS  Decision Support Systems (DSS) develops since 1950s.

There?re a specific class of computerized information sys- tems that supports business and organizational decision- making activities [11]. D.J.Power is maintaining a document [12], whose current version is 4.0 published in 2007, to  Fig. 2. Evolution towards Web DSS. [14]  summarize the brief history of DSS. According to his work, the history of DSS can be divided into five kinds of DSS frameworks as follows:  ? Data-driven DSS. It is the simplest DSS, which empha- sizes access to and manipulation of a time series of both internal data and external data.

? Model-driven DSS. It emphasizes access to and manipu- lation of a statistical, financial, optimization, or simula- tion model. In 2004, Gachet published a system named ?Dicodess? adopted many models in this distributed DSS [13].

? Communication-driven DSS. Also is related with co- operation work platform, it supports team work on a shared task. NetMeeting from Microsoft is a good example.

? Knowledge-driven DSS. Depends on expert system, it provides specialized problem-solving expertise stored as facts, rules, procedures, or in similar structures.

? Document-driven DSS. This is for e-formats unstruc- tured information. It provides management and manip- ulation method for these materials.

The idea of Web-based DSS was first proposed in 1995.

Kun Chang Lee and Namho Chung [14] sketched the evo- lution of DSS at Fig.2, which clearly shown that the web technologies pushing ahead the development of DSS.



III. THE CONCEPTUAL ARCHITECTURE OF WEB-BASED DSS ON SHOPPING MALL  In our study, we propose a novel DSS framework shown in Fig.3. The framework consists of external and internal DSS layers. To place an order, visitor can come from both external and internal DSS layers. Even visitor uses external layer firstly, the search result will induce him/her to visit internal DSS or product detail pages. The framework?s output is the input of the existing order process system. The external DSS is defined as the set of search engines, such as Google, Yahoo and Windows Live and so on. A mutual search engine uses some advanced search algorithms to promote its search result. For example, Google uses its secret PageRank algorithm to determine the quality of web pages and the     TABLE II THE GROWTH HISTORY OF WEB APPLICATION  Feature Web 1.0 Web 2.0 Web 3.0 Web type ?The content web? ?The document web? ?The data web?

relationship between pages and key words. When user inputs several terms for search, Google will return a list of URL links which sorts the results in PageRank order. This process is strictly related with the consuming model mentioned in Section I.

The external DSS is designed to handle with the following two problems in Web 2.0 environment.

(1) Key words. A key word is the criteria used for search engine. Depend on the customer?s personal comprehen- sion on each product, these words are chosen randomly and variously. Meanwhile, every search engine has individual index servers to save its own key words.

Hence, to satisfy both consumers and search engines, the problem is how to choose and determine the key words in our web sites.

(2) Search algorithms. As commerce secrets, most of the search algorithms used by search engine never been published publicly. It is fair for all commerce sites that researchers and web developers should produce pages and applications according to the open W3C standards.

At the same time, search engine optimization (SEO) is proposed to increase the relationship between web pages with search algorithms. The problem is how to process SEO to achieve the cooperation of consumers, search engines and web sites.

According to the Fig.3, a visitor has two ways to visit Internal DSS. One comes from external DSS layer, while the other comes from a new explorer session. The internal DSS serves as a recommendation system to bring customers a more accurate product list. The general algorithm process in our DSS is proposed in next section.



IV. WEB-BASED DSS USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION  A. Strategy for internal DSS  Recent advances in Internet, web application and database technology have made available a wealth of data on the buying habits of on-line customer. We want to propose a method of modeling these abundance data to understand the purchase behavior of e-commerce.

The e-commerce participant with own characteristic prob- ably has correspondence interesting products which have dif- ferent property, such as package, price, brand and review rate.

For an e-commerce participant, we want to show him/her the product which he/she may have interest in, according to the information provided by the participant and the historical transaction data.

Since there may be a great deal of products with associ- ation between them, the e-commerce participant would not only have interest in a few products. Therefore, at first we will group the products into several groups according to the product features, customer reviews and customer historical transactions. The clustered categories which is labeled by integer can be regarded as response variables (dependent variables) in the prediction model. Secondly, several types of the independent variables, which also named as demographic variables, are used according to the private information provided by the participant, such as age, gender, income, etc. Discretization strategy is used for features such as low-, medium-,and high-income. For both users and experts, dis- crete features are easier to understand ,use and explain [15].

At last, a logistic regression model is used to formulate the relationship between the customer and the product, i.e. the regression function for demographic variables as independent variables and response variable as dependent variable.

B. K-means Clustering Algorithm for Products  The K-means algorithm assigns each point to the cluster whose center (also called centroid) is the nearest. The center is the average of all the points in the cluster, i.e. the coordi- nation is the arithmetic mean for each dimension separately over all the points in the cluster. We group the available product into several clusters using the K-means clustering algorithm based on the product features, such as package,     price and transaction history etc. The K-means cluster is implemented as follows:  ? step 1: Choose the number of clusters, K.

? step 2: Randomly generate K clusters and determine  the center of the cluster, or directly generate K random points as cluster centers.

? step 3: Assign each point to the nearest cluster center.

? step 4: Recompute the new cluster centers.

? step 5: Repeat the previous two steps until some con-  vergence criterion is met.

The clustered products are denoted as C1, ? ? ? , CK .

C. Logistic Regression  Logistic regression is used to predict the probability oc- currence of an event by fitting data to a logistic curve. It is a generalized linear model used for binomial regression.

Like many forms of regression analysis, it makes use of several predictor variables that may be either numerical or categorical. For example, the probability that a person has a heart attack within a specified time period might be predicted from knowledge of the person?s age, sex and body mass index. Logistic regression is used extensively in the medical and social sciences as well as marketing applications such as prediction of a customer?s propensity to purchase a product or cease a subscription [16].

We denote the probability of a participant has interest in the cluster i as:  Pr{G = i|X = x} = pi(x; ?) (1) where X is demographic variable for the e-commerce  participant and ? is the parameter set need to be estimated.

The logistic regression model with K categories for the response variable has the form in the following:  log p1(x; ?) pK(x; ?)  = ?10 + ? ? 1x  log p2(x; ?) pK(x; ?)  = ?20 + ? ? 2x  ...

log pK?1(x; ?) pK(x; ?)  = ?(K?1)0 + ? ? K?1x (2)  where ? = {?10, ?1, ? ? ? , ?(K?1)0, ?K?1} is the entire parameter set. The model is specified in terms of K ? 1 log-odds transformations reflecting the constraint that the probabilities sum to 1. The parameters are usually estimated by the maximum likelihood estimation, in which using the Newton-Raphson algorithm to maximize the likelihood.



V. THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF COMMERCEPRO  A. The architecture of CommercePro  Browser/Server (B/S) architecture is a popular three-tier design in web application development. CommercePro also  Fig. 4. CommercePro Architecture  adopts this architecture shown in Fig.4.

In this figure, the bounder of our solution is defined by different interfaces of gateway for payment or warehouse MIS. The solution contains of two parts, the front site for consumers and the back office system for administrators.

Both parts can be divided into three tiers. Each tier is assigned with different features and functions supported by some mutual technologies and tools.

(1) Data access tier. This tier processes raw data through data operation languages (e.g. SQL). The raw data stored in various forms, such as database, plat text file or multi-dimension database. The service provided here is the terminal response for the upper tiers, and result in the final information changes. In CommercePro, we provide two protocols for data access. One is SQL code auto-generated by CodeGun tool, while the other is persistent data produced by NHibernate.

(2) Business logic tier. This tier focuses on the manufac- turing of detailed problems. Namely, this tier manages data access tier by assigning it many specific tasks.

In CommercePro, most primary business logics are implemented in this tier. Considering the features of database server, some used frequently business logics are coded in SQL stored procedures.

(3) Presentation tier. This tier is the host of web pages. Web page is the only entrance of communication between software and customers, also known as user interface (UI). Accompanying with the emerging of Web 2.0, Ajax or Flex have been applied in this tier to improve the friendship of UI and eliminate the gap between Windows Application and Web Application.

B. The design to satisfy web-based DSS  1) A design for social network services: In general, based on the characteristics of Web 2.0, a typical web application should consider the following aspects, namely, good-quality     user experience, constructive comment and feedback meth- ods, and easy-access visit, etc. In our study, we transform these aspects into the following practical items.

? One-stop shopping, but split order automatically. Cus- tomers may choose products from different stores, while the order process flow is a black box for them. The shopping mall provides a unique purchase flow to han- dle with all the products. Due to the different warehouse deployment and shipment, CommercePro will split one order into several sub-orders.

? Product presentations for quick-search. CommercePro lists the products in various ways including cross refer- ences.

? Various social network marketing. The marketing strate- gies in online mall always consider the social network communication. For example, customers can earn re- demption points through recommending their friends to place first order.

? Use cookies to save customer?s profile. Cookie is an important place to save customers profile in client terminal. Saving these useful data in a long or short term, once a regular customer visit our site, we can get the personal information from the matched cookies for recommendation system.

? Optimize caches. Our solution use this item to increase the page presentation speed and decrease the server workload.

2) Use SEO to design the external DSS: Since Web 2.0 is a network with abundant information created by the crowds, how to seek the goals in this kind of disorder and chaos becomes a critical problem. In fact, the search engine (e.g.

Google) is the unique way to locate the objective pages. As we have discussed in the conceptual architecture above, SEO improves the rank of web sites. One of the general foundation of SEO is to help web spider, the tool of search engine, to grasp the web site?s information as accurate as possible, as frequent as possible. Our solutions use the following methods to help web spider.

? Multiple languages support. All search engines support multiple languages. For example, Google involves 24 languages from all over the world. To guarantee the inte- grality, our solution provides multiple language support.

A basis rule is that the web application always contains native language and English at least.

? Create standard HTML pages. Static pages, mainly use HTML format, are the most suitable pages for web spider. This is because a search engine does not have enough time to cache the dynamic pages. A standard HTML page separates content and style using cascading style sheets (CSS). Hence, the size of a web page is reasonable to guarantee the onload time for explorer.

W3C also indicates a good quality page should contains full meta properties, which are the main sources for web spider.

? Use completed URL. This is another trick for SEO.

Fig. 5. An example for recommendation marketing.

Fig. 6. Comments of product induce a new sale.

Through building a completed URL consists of useful information, we can provide accurate links for search engine. The common method is to combine key words with detailed feature value in the URL.

Take the following string as an example, ?/productde- tail.aspx?productID=409&category=134&Language=en?.

In this URL, productID, category and Language are keywords for search engines while they are followed by the specific value respectively. Thus, different product has different completed URL, which will encourage search engine to index more pages of the current web site.



VI. PROTOTYPE SYSTEM AND EXPERIMENTAL RESULT  In our study, CommercePro has been applied to serval commerce cases. One of the most successful commerce case is Diapers.com, which has achieved one million dollars amount in 2008. The web site is designed subjects to the requirement of Web 2.0. We only take two examples to prove this conclusion. Fig. 5 shows that, a new customer input his/her referee?s email to get a discount. This design obeys to a basic theory of social network service (SNS). The theory states that, people like to create a virtual relationship in network. SNS helps people to maintain and enlarge this kind of relationship.

Also based on SNS, Fig.6 shows the comments on a product from a customer, which will affect others to purchase or ignore this same product. Known as praise marketing, this model use the specific communication function of Web 2.0.

Our solution handles with customer profile, product infor- mation and sales history as the foundation of DSS. Here we use product information for explaining.

In practical design, we use cascaded links to de- scribe a product. The links starts from catalog/store, then category/sub-category, then product, closes at product item.

The lower level is derived from upper level. Meanwhile, we     Fig. 7. The flow of product presentation.

have two supplementary branches to enrich the links. One refers to category and product brands, the other refers to search items. These three branches depict a product in detail, which form the basic information for clustering products.

Fig.7 shows the links, while Fig.8 illustrates the E-R map of database.



VII. CONCLUSION  This paper reviews the development of web application and DSS. It also looks back the features and construction of web-based DSS. One of our contributions is creating a new categorization method for e-commerce, which reveals the es- sential improvement of e-commerce in Web 2.0 environment.

The second contribution is that, we propose a whole blueprint for web-based DSS for online shopping mall, which contains external and internal layers. This proposal involves SEO and data mining into a full system, which extends the definition field of DSS in e-commerce.

We develop a solution for online shopping mall, which implements recommendation system based on web-based DSS. This paper also presents the conceptual architecture and practical implementation of our solution.

In the future, our work may includes the following items:  (1) Make external layer and internal layer work closely in our DSS conceptual framework. Currently, search engine is a stand-alone and external module. According to the vision of semantic web, the future work may cover how to accomplish communication between SE and e-commerce.

(2) Develop, compare and find out a better algorithm for recommendation system. Many researchers are working on algorithms improvement. Our goal is to set up a criteria to compare these algorithms, and to find out a suitable one for practice.

(3) Model the consumer buying behavior in computers.

Because trading is a social behavior, it is not easy to model the pattern. The future work will seek a method to simulate this behavior for testing our solution.
