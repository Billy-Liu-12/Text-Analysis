Optimizing the Overseas Oil Transportation Paths Based on Fuzzy Multi- objective Programming

ABSTRACT  With China's degree of dependence upon overseas oil increase every year, the supply of oil resources impacts country?s economic development and social stability directly. However, overseas oil imports exists such as piracy attacks, line accident and other risk during transportation, so a reasonable choice of transportation paths can control cost, reduce risk. A multi-objective transportation problem which considering distance and risk in the supply of oil import is presented. Then a mathematic model of this transportation problem is established. Based on a fuzzy programming algorithm distributing in the partial big-scale parabola, and then solving the model by a distance-risk matrix for a optimal compromise solution, finally with the actual data about China's crude oil imports in 2006 for the model verification, in order to provide policy suggest for china to choosing reasonable transportation paths.

China's oil resources supply and demand situation has a direct impact on the country's social stability and economic security, particularly since 2002 China become the world's second largest oil consumer. With economic development, China's dependency upon overseas oil will be higher. According to General Administration of Customs released the data, crude oil imports in 2008 amounted to 1.7889 million tons with the dependency has more than 50%, close to red lines, in addition to 2009 Blue Paper on China's energy forecast released China's oil import dependency will rise to 64.5% in 2020[1]. In the process of overseas oil imports, transportation is a vital link, which directly affects the success of the entire import process. According to customs statistics, China's oil imports by sea of about 95%, and in the whole process of transportation paths involved in the line accident, port risk, pirate attacks, and many other uncertain factors, It is estimated that China's oil imports nearly 85% is transported through the Malacca Strait, while the Malacca Strait has always been the focus of the region by pirate attacks. The other hand, the distance of the transportation paths is a direct impact on transportation cost, how to balancing the risk and distance cost is a worthy issue for studying. Some foreign scholars have already studied about the oil transportation from overseas, but most of them in pursuit of the lowest total cost, minimum total time and other single-target model.

However, this paper based on a fuzzy programming algorithm distributing in the partial big-scale parabola, using distance-risk matrix to solve the model for a optimal compromise solution, finally by a case study about China's crude oil imports in 2006  to verify the model , in order to provide policy suggestion for China to choose  reasonable transportation paths.

2. LITERATURE  REVIEW With regard to overseas oil transportation and multi- objective problem has become the focus research for scholars at domestic and abroad, such as Carla Oliveira, Carlos Henggeler. Antunes(2004) [2] put forward a multi-objective model optimization problems based on method of linear programming about economy, energy, environment factors in the production of manufacturing, including energy strategy, economic growth, social welfare, environment-friendly elements and other indicators, the main research purpose of the burden on the environment (global warming and acidification) to assess and give to the appropriate decision support; Umut R.Tuzkaya, Semih. Onut(2008) [3] by fuzzy network analysis (ANP) the mode of transportation for some quantitative and qualitative criteria in order to obtain a comprehensive evaluation of the most suitable mode, and then by Turkey logistics service company case for the model verification.

Gang Wu, Lan-Cui Liu, Yi-Ming Wei (2009) [4] use portfolio theory to calculating China's crude oil imports in general and special risk, and put forward based on an improved theory of the portfolio model of risk indicators to determining the risk of accident rate about China's imports route, but there is no case study in the paper; Liu Xinwang (2001) [5] proposed a fuzzy reasoning based on the objective function integrated approach, through the fuzzy rules directly to express the decision maker's preference knowledge structure; Zhang Liang, Wang DuanMing (2005)[6] taking into account the time and safety factors during the war in multi-objective transportation problems and the establishment of a mathematical model of transportation, using a fuzzy programming algorithm distributing in the partial big- scale parabola, through an improved tabular method obtained the best compromise solution, but it lacks effective examples to demonstrating the model; Wu Gang, Yi-Ming Wei (2009) [7] put forward that oil     imports were mainly dependent on sea transport, from the carrier risk, pirate attacks and other factors to analysis the risk of sea transport, but the article is mainly from a qualitative point of view on China's oil imports risk ,there is no practical case analysis.

For China's overseas oil transportation not only to emphasize the lowest cost of oil transportation, the risk should get the same attention, therefore, In this paper, using a fuzzy programming algorithm distributing in the partial big-scale parabola to carry out non-dimensional treatment target, and thus find the lowest distance and risk cost about oil transportation of  multi-objective optimization program.

3. MODELING AND SOLVING  2.1 Description of  the problem  In the process of the imports for overseas oil resources, assuming that each area's oil resources is only one port, and m ports of resources imported into China by sea to n ports. The i  resources port be able to supply oil resources is ia  ( i  = 1,2, ... ... m), the j ports need oil is  ib ( j  = 1,2 ... ... n), and ( 1 1  m n  ij ij i j  a b = =  =? ? ).And the risk  about the i resources ports to the j  ports is ijp ,the distance is ijl .

For the import of overseas oil resources in multi- objective transportation problems, we intend to pursue the smallest distance cost and the lowest risk cost of multi-objective optimization model. The objective function which pursuit the smallest distance cost is as follows:  1 1  min m n  ij ij i j  z l x = =  =??   The lowest cost of risk in the pursuit of the objective function is as follows:  1 1  min m n  ij ij i j  z c x = =  =??   But for these two goals do not have the cumulative nature, we can carry out a fuzzy programming algorithm distributing in the partial big-scale parabola to dimensionless processing for determining the indicator?s grade of membership, and then using fuzzy linear programming method to transforming a multi-objective into a single-objective transportation problem, getting a distance-risk matrix   for   solving the model.

In addition, we can calculate the distance-risk matrix of the basic feasible solution of the maximum distance and the greatest risk of fuzzy sets to take control of key line, setting goals, decision-making. We can establish the following objective function as follows:  min max( )kk ijz d= The objective function constraints are as follows:   1 2  1 1  1, 2 ,  1, 2 , .

,  0 ( )  n  ij i j  m  ij j i  ij ij ij ij  m n  ij i i i j  x a i m  x b j n s t  d l d p  x a b  =  =  = =  ? = =? ? ?  = =? ? ? = = ? ?  ? =? ?  ?  ?  ? ?  ? ?  ? ?   ijx   refers to the ridership from the i  ports to the j ports; 1ijd  refers to the distance from the i  ports to the j ports; 2ijd   refers to the risk rate from the i  ports to the j ports.

2.2 Model  Solution  Definition 1: For the above models ideal solution is to make k-objective functions to optimize simultaneously, but the best compromise solution is a solution which decision-makers select the most preferred and effective solution according to the criteria for assessment of priorities in all feasible solutions.

But such as a complex multi-objective programming problem for overseas oil transportation, the establishment of an appropriate evaluation function is more difficulty, in this paper we use fuzzy linear programming method to transfer multi-objective problem into single-objective transportation problem which can be more convenient to find an optimal compromise solution.

2.3 Grade membership of  indicator  All of the above indicators, the line distance and  risk rate are all dimensionless value, because of their differences in dimension. It is difficult to conducting a comprehensive comparison. It must conduct a dimensionless treatment, that is, the indicator value to do standardization, regular treatment, in order to eliminate the unnecessary impact. In this article we mainly take a fuzzy programming algorithm distributing in the partial big-scale parabola to describe the grade of membership of   indicators:   0 , min  min ( ) ( ) min max  max min 1, max  k k ij  k k ijk k k k  ij ijk k  k k ij  d d  d d f d d d d  d d d d  ? ? ?  ?? = ? ?? ?? ? ? ?    k ijd   refers to the actual value of the transport data;  maxkd  refers to the maximum value of K indicators in transport data; minkd  refers to the minimum value of K indicators in transport data. For overseas oil transportation, in accordance with the factors to be considered of the different importance by experts survey method to obtain the weight vector as follows:     1 2  ( , ), , 0k k k  W ? ? ? ? =  = ??   2.4 Model solve by distance-risk matrix  Zhang Liang (2005) [6] has been applied to using the time-consuming matrix for describe the time and safety indicators value. Therefore, this paper uses the distance- risk matrix to describing the distance and risk value in the process of oil in the overseas transportation. Suppose C is the distance-risk matrix, the element of the matrix ijC? is called the distance and risk value.

Suppose 1 21 2[ . ( ) . ( )],ij ij ijC K f d f d? ?= +?  K is a constant, the distance-risk matrix as follows:  ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )  ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )  1 2 1 2 1 11 2 11 1 1 2 1  1 2 1 2 1 1 2 1 1 2  . . . .

Therefore, we use a fuzzy programming algorithm distributing in the partial big-scale parabola transfer a multi-objective into a single-objective transportation problem:    1 1  min max( )  1,2,  . 1,2,  0 ( )  ij  n  ij i j  m  ij ij i  m n  ij i i i j  z C  x a i m  s t x b j n  x a b  =  =  = =  =  ? = =? ? ?? = =? ? ?  ? =? ??  ?  ?  ? ?  ?  ??  ??    4. CASE STUDY  According to Customs statistics, China imported 145.18 million tons of crude oil in 2006, of which 18.976 million tons of imports through the pipeline, 126.2046 million tons was imported by sea. China's overseas oil imports mainly from the Middle East, Africa, South America and Southeast Asia. It will be mainly divided into the following four categories, as shown in Table :  TABLE I.

The results can be drawn from the following revelation:   1) China's oil imports from overseas sources mainly in the Middle East and Africa region in 2006, the total share of 52% and 36.2%, according to Table  shows that we are in the process of importing oil should try to imported from the Middle East to China's the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta, Southeast Asia focused on the import of routes assigned to the Pearl River Delta of China (Guangdong) region, so that can be considered under the premise of the risk factors to minimize the line distance, and reduce the traffic load pressure on the South China Sea;   2) The choice of line in South America the country imported oil to the Bohai Sea region, because the main westbound line through the Panama Canal, the Japan Sea and the Bohai Bay will be shipped to China Bohai Sea Rim. On the one hand, westbound line can shorten transportation distance,  on the other hand ,it can avoid high- risk area such as the Malacca Strait and the Indian Ocean high piracy regions;   3) In addition, from the distance-risk matrix can be  seen max( ) 86.75ijC =?  in Table , so ensure that the entire transportation lowest cost and risk situation, should focus on imports of South American line to strengthen the protection and controls of the line, as in South America is far apart from the largest value and  the highest risk of  the line;   4) From the data and results of this article can be  seen, China's import of over-reliance on the Middle East, has exceeded the internationally recognized warning line of not more than 30 percent. Over-concentration of resources easily be imported by the country's political and social stability of the constraints, so we can expand the Caspian Sea region of Central Asia, as well as Russia, Kazakhstan and other pipeline transportation mode of development and utilization, achieve diversification strategy of oil imports and reduce oil-producing countries of political instability and regional conflicts to impacting on China's oil imports.

5. CONCLUSION  For overseas oil multi-objective transportation problems, we use a fuzzy programming algorithm distributing in the partial big-scale parabola which will consider the distance, risk of overseas oil import to converted multi- objective into single-objective transportation problems.

Through the distance-risk matrix and improved table operation method to obtain the optimal compromise solution, providing basis for transportation routes decision making for China. In the course of the study there are still some areas for improvement, such as not comprehensive enough to consider the risk factors, including the import of resources, political risk, the port's throughput ,handling capacity risk indicators should also be taken into account, some studies will be further improved  in the future.
