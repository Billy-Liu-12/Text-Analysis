A more generalized representation of fuzzy information system may be regarded as a mapping to a possibility .of  fuzzy data in the corresponding domain attribute. In other words, a possibility of fuzzy data might be regarded as a level 2 fuzzy set. Similarity relation between two fuzzy data satisfies the properties of weak similarity relations in which similarity between two fuzzy data may not necessarily be symmetric or transitive. In the fuzzy information system, two object9 are intuitively looked more similar if their similar values of attributes are rarer. Hence, this paper proposes a concept of calculating similarity between two objects by considering rare values of attributes in a generalized fuzzy information system.

I .  INTRODUCTION  Information system, also called information table, as a knowledge representation, contains data about objects of in- terest characterized by some attributes or features. Generally, information system could be used to recognize an object through its features or attributes. Objects could be anything, human, plant, animal, event, condition, etc. In many appli- cations, information system can be extended to represent and generate association rules performing a decision table.

Simply, an information system may be represented using a two-dimensional table in which generally rows and columns represent objects and attributes, respectively as shown in Table I.

The simplest form of information system, called binary in- formation s y "  (see Table II), is provided by assigned (0 , l ) for all domain attributes. Hence, every object is regarded as a (crisp) set of attributes. Binary information system may then be generalized to fuzzy infomation sysrem (see Table 111) by allowing every domain attribute to take a value in the unit in- terval [0, 11. Clearly, every object can be represented as a fuzzy set on the set of attributes. Moreover, we may generalize fuzzy information system by considering every domain attribute consisting of fuzzy data as given in Table W. In this case, every cell in Table I, aj(ui) ,  as a corresponding between object and attribute, consists of a fuzzy data. Hence, every object can be regarded as a set of' fuzzy sets corresponding to domain attributes. Furthermore, we may provide a more generalized  fuzzy information system dealing with a possibility of fuzzy data as shown in Table V. Here, every cell in Table I might be regarded as a level 2 fuzzy set.

Generally, the concepts of similarity relation between [WO objects are proposed by calculating only similar values of their attributes, without any consideration to the number of their values of attributes compared with other values in the universal set of objects. However, based on hummi6 perception, two ob- jects with a given similar value of attribute may have different degree of similarity in two different discourse universal sets of objects. Two objects are intuitivcly looked more similar if their similar vaIues of corresponding attributes are rarer. For exam- ple, in the universal set of all-American people, Ronald Reagen and Jimmy Carter have high degree of similarity to each other, not because they are male, but they are ex-presidents of USA.

Their degree of similarity will reduce when the discourse universal set of objects is all-American presidents. Therefore, in  [6] we proposed and discussed a concept and its mathematical properties of similarity relation between two objects in a binary information system based on rarity of attribute value. This paper extends the concept to predictably calculate similarity degree relationship between two objects in  a more generalized representation of fuzzy information system. First, we assume that similarity relation between two fuzzy data satisfies properties of a weak similarity relation in which similarity relation between two fuzzy data may not necessarily be symmetric or transitive. Two asymmetric fuzzy classes of an object could be provided dealing with the weak similarity relation applied on a domain attribute. Next, two measures, namely usualness and rareness measures, on a given object are defined using two different functions. Finally, our primary concern in this paper is to introduce and define an extended concept of simiiarity relation between two objects in the generalized representation of fuzzy information system based on weak similarity relation and rareness measure.

The structure of the paper is the following. In Section I1 and 111, basic concepts of information systems and similarity relations are recalled and discussed. Section IV as a main contribution of this paper, is devoted to propose a similarity relation between two objects. Finally a conclusion is given in Section V.

INFORMATION SYSTEM From Tiible 111, we have:  u1 u 2  A data Iable, called iilfomntion system of irIformatiori fable [3], [9], contains data about objects of interest chatac- terized by some attributes. Formally, an information system is defined as a pair I = (U, A ) ,  where U is a non-empty finite set of objects called the universe, and A is a non-empty finite set of arrn'butes such that aj : U + R, for every aj E A.

The set RJ is a domain or value set of attrihute uj.Simply, an information system can be represented by the foIlowing data table; for U = ( ~ 1 , .  . .,un}, A = { G I , .  . .,a,,} and aj(ui) E Dj.

{0.8/Young,1/[20,25]} { O.E/Averye.O.4/Gocd} { IIYoung.0.21Middle Age) {O.B/Avernge.O.S/Good)  TABLE I A N  INIWKMATT1ON SYSTEM  A binary information system as the simplest form of in- formation system, is provided by restricting every domain, Dj = {0,1} , where if a j ( u I )  = 1 means ui satisfies attribute a j ;  On the other hand, aj(ua) = 0 means U* does not satisfy attribute u j .  Thus, an object may be regarded as a subset of attributes. For instancc, from Table 11,  TABLE I1 BINAUY INFORMATION SYSTEM  A binary information system could be generalized to a fuzzy information system by allowing every domain attribute, Dj, to take a value in the unit interval [O, 11. In fuzzy information system, an object can be regarded as a fuzzy set on the set of attributes.

TABLE 111 A N  F U U Y  INFORMATION SYSTEM  ~i = {0.5/a3,1/a5},  U? = {l/a1,0.8/a~,l/a4,o.6/a,~,  = {0.3/a3,1/ad, 0.2/a7, l/as}, u4 = {0.9/a2, 0.4/ad1 I/%, I / ~ S } ~  where pul (Q) = 0.5.

Fuzzy information system may then be generalized by  considering every domain, Dj, consisting of precise as well as imprecise data (fuzzy valueddata). Table 111 shows a generalized fuzzy information system that consists of objects, U = {u l , .  . ., uj}  and two attributes, AGE and APTITUTE where data or values of both domain attributes are fuzzy data.

Obviously, an object could be represented by a set of fuzzy  TABLE IV A GENERALIZI':!) FUZZY INFORMATION SYSTlrM  Average Middle Age Very Good r a 2 S I  Average About-50 Outstanding  data corresponding to the domain attributes. From Table IV,  u1 = {Young,Good} u3 = {Middle Age, Very Good}, U? = {Young, Average) u4 = {[20,25], Average}, u5 = {About - 50, Outstanding}.

A more generalized representation of fuzzy information system may be regarded as a mapping to a possibility of fuzzy data in the corresponding domain of attribute such that aj  : U -+ TI(Dj) for every ai f A, where n ( D j )  is a set of possibilities on domain Dj characterized by a set of possibility distribution functions {7ri j jr iJ  : Dj 4 [O,  l]}, for j = 1 , .  . . , m. Thus, aj(ui) = (7rij(d)/dld E Dj is fuzzy data}, where xa3(d) /d  means possibility of d in a j ( a i )  is  equal to r i j ( d ) .

Table V shows a more generalized fuzzy information system that consists of objects, U = (111,. . ., us} and two attributes, AGE and APTITUTE. Clearty, every cell of table, aj(ui) ,  TABLE V A MORE GENEKALIZED FU7ZY INFORMATION SYSTEM  r U I AGEiAI I APTITUTE(AP) I  might be-regarded as a level 2 fuzzy set. An object in Table     V may be regarded as a set of a possibility of fuzzy sets as given by:  u1 = {{O.8/Y0uug, 1/[20,25]}, { 0.8/Average, 0.4/ Good} } ,  212 = ({  1/Young, 0.2/Middle Age}, { O.B/Average , 0.5/Good} } ,  u3 = {{1/Middle Age}, {l/Vei-y Good}},  u5 = {{1/About - 505, {l/Outstsnding}}.

uq = { { 1/[20,25] }, I I/Averw;el I,  111. SlMtLARITY RELATIONS  Concepts of similarity relation play important role in many applications, such as data clustering, data querying, pattern recognition, etc. It is well known that the most restrictive similarity relation for crisp data, called equivalence relatiom, is characterized hy reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity .

Definition I: An equivalence relation is a mapping, Ej : D, x D3 4 [0, I], such ha t  for 5, y, z E Dj,  (a) Reflexivity :  (b) Symmetry :  (c) Trsrisitivity :  E j ( Z ,  x) = 1,  E j b ,  Y) = EJY, x),  Ej(2,y) = 1, E.j(y, Z) = 1 =+ E~(z, 2) = 1.

To deal with fuzzy data, in 1970, Zadch proposed a weaker  relation, called fuzzy similarity relatioti. Formally, a fuzzy similarity relation, sj, for a given domain, Dj, maps each pair of elements in the domain to an element in the closed interval [0,1].

Definirioti 2: [4] A fuzzy similarity relation is a mapping,  There is a considcrable criticism about the use of fuzzy similarity relation, especially for the property of max-min transitivity (see e.g. in [I]) .  To easily understand this criticism, a simple illustration is given by 'an example. Let us suppose that m e  is similar to two to a level of 0.8, and two is similar to three to a level of 0.8. According to max-min transitivity, the similarity between one and rhree must be no less than 0.8. Therefore max-min transitivity is considered as a very restrictive constraint. Considering this reason, in 1980 [2], a weaker relation, called proximity (or resemblance) relation, was introduced and characterized by only reflexivity and symmetry.

However, whcn we consider that every element of data represented in human's word or phrase has different range of meaning in which some words may have more general meaning than the others, thc similarity relation between two scalar data may not necessarily be symmetric or transitive as represented by condirioiial probability relation [7] .

Dejnitiow 3: A conditional probability relation i s  a map- ping, R : Dj x Dj + {O, 11, such that for 2, y E Dj,  where R(z,  y) means the degree y supports z or the degree y is similar to 2.

Related to the properties of conditional probability relation, in [XI we introduced an interesting mathcmatical relation, called w e d  sirnilnrig relution as a generalization of fuzzy similarity relation.

Dejinition 4: A weak similarity relation is a mapping, S, : Dj x D, + [O. 11, such that for 2, y E Dj,  (a) Reflexivity : Sj(Z, .) = 1,  (b) Conditional symmetry :  ( c )  Conditional trarisitivity : if SJ(x i  y) > 0 then Sj(y, 2) > 0 ,  if Sj(z, y) 2 Sj(y, X) > 0 and  then Sj(z, z )  2 S j ( z ,  x).

As mentioned in Section I, in the definition of fuzzy informa- tion system, data in Dj may be precise as well as imprecise data (fuzzy values). Therefore, similarity relation bctwecn two fuzzy data in Dj satisfies the weak similarity relation.

Example 1: Related to Table XV and V, TabIe VI and VI1 arbitrarily show similarity relation between two fuzzy data in domain AGE and APTITUTE, respectively.

sj (Y, 2) 2 sj ( z ,  Y) > 0  TABLE VI SIMILARITY LEVEL OF AGE (SAG(Z,Y))  TABLE VI1 SIMILARITY LEVEL 01: A P T I T U D E ( S A ~ ( Z ,  U))     We consider that similarity relationship between two fuzzy data satisfies weak similuriq relation as defined in previous section. Similarity relationship between two objects, ui and U k ,  in  corresponding to a certain attribute, a j ,  in a more generalized fuzzy information system, is defined by a function  Dejnirion 5: 0, is a mapping, S, : II(D,) x n(D,)  -+ OJnj (4, aj(uk)): [O, 11:  s , b , ( 4 a J ( u k ) )  =  Cya, S U P , E D , M G  Y) x mi4%(2).  7 d Y ) ) ) E Y E D ,  % (Y)  , ( 1 )  where S3(z, U) is a weak similarity relation for z given y.

In other words, BJ(a3(ul) ,  a j ( u k ) )  can be also means degree of similarity between two cells of tablc, aJ(u,)  and a,(un.)).

Example 2: From Tablc V and VI,  = 0.72, = 0.89, = 0.24, = 0.64, = 1, = 0.91, = 0, = 0, = 0.3, = 0.42,  = 0.8, = 0.7, = 0.18, = 0.08, = 0.4, = 0.2,.

Similarly,  = 0.92, = 1, = 0.4, = 0.23, = 0.8, = 0.87, = 0.24, = 0.1,  0~p({l /VG},  {O.S/A, 0.5/G}) 0.25, @ ~ p ( { o . 8 / A ,  0.5/G}, {l/A}) -= 0.8, @ ~ p ( ( l / A ) ,  {0.8/Y, 0.5/G}) = 0.85, B ~ p ( { 0 . 8 / A ,  0.5/G}, {I/O}) = 0.3, e~p({l/o}, {0.8/A, 0.5/G}) = 0.16,  ~ A P ( { ~ / V G } ,  {1/A}) = 0.15, O A P ( { ~ / A } ,  {l/VG}) = 0.3, ~ ~ d l l / V G } ,  {1/0)) = 0.9, BAP({^/^}, {l/VG}) = 0.9,  @np({ l /O) ,  ( 1 / A ) )  = 0.

odP({1/A), (1/0}) = 0,  In a gencralized fuzzy information systcm, every cell of table consists of one fuzzy data.. Thus, it can be verificd i f  af(u,) = x and a,(ue) = y then 8,(q(u1) ,a , (~,4)  = S3(z, y). Also, OJ(u,(ut), u,(?k)) satisfies all properties of the weak similarity rclation. From thc property of conditional symmetry, it can be followed that we can generate two asymmetric fuzzy classes of E U as given by:  where 8j (a j (u i ) ,  u j (u) ) /u  and Oj(aj(u), aj(ui))/u mean membership degrees of U in fuzzy classes Sj(ui) and 'PjPjui) are equal to B,(a3(ui), aj(u))  and @,(aj(u), aj (uz)) ,  respec- tively. In other words, p ~ ~ ( ~ < ) ( u )  = $(aj(ui) ,  aj(u)) .  Simi- larly, , ~ p , ( ~ , ) ( u )  = Oj(uj(u),aj(ui)). Sj(ui) is a fuzzy class over all elements of U that are similar to ui in which their degrees of similarity are represented by their membership function. On the other hand, Pj(ui) is a fuzzy class over all elements of U to which ui is similar in which their degrees of similarity are represented by their membership function.

Exumple 3: From Table V and VI, S A G ( U ~ )  is given by:  S A G ( U ~ )  = {1/ui, 0.72/~2 ,0 .24/~3 ,1 /~4) , SAG(U1)  = {0.89/~1, l / U z ,  0.3/~3,0.8/~4,0.18/U5}, SAG(u3)  = { 0 . 6 4 / U l ,  0.42/~2,  1 / U g ,  0.4/~4,0.9/ti5),  SAG(U4)  = {0.91/Ul, 0.7/U'2,0.2/% 1/u4) , SAG(U~) = {0.08/~2,0.5/~3,1/~g).

Similarly, P A G ( u ~ )  is given by:     From Table V and VII, S ~ p ( u i )  is givcn by:  S~p(u1) = { ~ / u I ,  0.92/7~2,0.4/~3,0.8/u4,0.24/~~},  S A P ( U ~ )  {1/ui, 1/ua, 0.4/~3, O . ~ / U S ,  0 - 3 / ~ 5 } , S A ~ ( U ~ )  = { 0 . 2 3 / ~ i , 0 . 2 5 / ~ 2 ,  1 / ~ ~ , 0 . 1 5 / ~ 4 , O . g / ~ 5 } , S ~ p ( . u q )  = {0.87/~1, 0.85/u2, 0 . 3 / ~ 3 ,  1 / U 4 ) , S A P ( U ~ )  = { O . l / ~ l ,  0 . 1 6 / ~ 2 , 0 . 9 / ~ 3 ,  I / ? L ~ } .

Similarly, PAP(U;) is given by:  PAp('tL1) = { 1 / ~ 1 ,  1 / ~ 2 , 0 . 2 3 / ~ : < ,  0 . 8 7 / , ~ ~ ,  O.l /Ug}t 'PAP(,,). = {0.92/~1, 1 / ~ p ,  0.25/~3,0.85/~4,0.16/~~}, P ~ p ( u 3 )  = { O . ~ / U L ,  0.4/~2,1/~2~3,0.3/u4, 0 . 9 / ~ ~ } , P ~ p ( u 4 )  = {0.8/u1,0.8/u2,0.15/u3, r/ud>, P A ~ ( , u ~ )  = {0.15/,~1, 0 . 3 / ~ 2 , 0 . 9 / ~ 3 ,  f / ~ g } .

It can be proved that p ~ ~ ( ~ , l ( u k ) ' =  p ~ ~ ( ~ , ) ( u i ) .

Furthermore, before defining similarity relation between two objects, we need to define two measures on U ,  namely usualness and rareness measures, using two functions, p and 19, as follows.

Dejnirion 6:. Usualness and rareness measures are defined by two functions, p, (ui) and 29j (ui), which provide degrees of usualness and rareness of uLi E U in terms of domain attribute, Dj .  $ ( U i , U h )  where IPj(ui)l = E, ;L~~(,~)(U) and IUI means cardinality of U or number of elements in U. Thus, cpj(u;), 6j(u;) f [&! 11.

From (4) and (3, it can be verified,  d j ( U i )  = 1 - ' P j ( U i )  + - VI '  Example 4: Related to Example 3,  uk U1 I U2 1 U 3  I U4 I U5  3.16  2.92  2.24  3.2 ( P A G ( U ~ )  = - = 0.64  2.08  3.2  ( P A ~ ( u ~ )  = - = 0.64  3.18 ~ p ~ p ( ~ 2 )  = - = 0.636 5  pnc(.~l) = - = 0.632  ( P A G ( U ~ )  = - = 0.584  ( P A G ( U ~ )  = 5 = 0.448  ( P A G ( U ~ )  = - = 0.416  .3  5 ( P A P ( W )  = - = 0.68 2.75  2.35   p ~ p ( ~ q )  = - = 0.55  p ~ p ( ~ 5 )  = - = 0.47  Our primary concern in  this paper is to introduce and define similarity relation between two objects in a more generalized representation of fuzzy information system as follows;  Definition 7: Similarity relation between two objects ut, U L  f U is defined by a function $ ( U $ ,  UL) E [0, 11.

V. CONCLUSION First, this paper discussed information system, as a tool  to represent knowledge, from binary information system to be a more generalized fuzzy information system. Also, we discussed briefly some concepts of similarity relation from the most restrictive relation, called equivalence relation, to weak similarity relation by which we consider that similarity relation between two scalar dala may not necessarily be symmetric or transitive. A function was defined to calculate degree of similarity relation between two scalars domain in a more generalized fuzzy information system in which every scalar domain is regarded as a possibility of fuzzy sets or a level 2 fuzzy set. Two asymmetric similarity classes of a given object were proposed based on a certain attribute. Moreover, two opposite measures, namely usualness and rareness measures, were provided in order to calculate degree of rarity of a given object, Finally, as a main contribution, this paper discussed and proposed a concept of cakulating similarity degrce between two objects based on the weak similarity rekition and rareness measures.
