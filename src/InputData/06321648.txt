Optimizing Mining Association Rules based on  Artificial Neural Network

Abstract?The basic function of a neural system is to intelligent learning from specific examples known as neurons. It has great pattern adaptive capability that may be used to judge between old model and well model. Neural systems have many characteristics such as autonomous, uniqueness, recognition of foreigners, noise tolerance, and distributed detection. Inspired by neural network system, Artificial Neural Network has emerged during the last decade. It is incited by many researchers to build, study, and design neural-based models for a variety of application regions. Artificial neural system can be defined as adaptive model that is inspired by neural network, observed neural functions, mechanisms and principles. Association rule mining is one of well researched and the most important techniques of datum mining. The purpose of association rules is to refine interesting correlations, associations, frequent patterns, or casual constructions in sets of aims in other datum repositories or the transaction databases.

Association rule is widely used in various regions such as telecommunication network, inventory control, intelligent decision, risk management and market analysis etc.

Artificial Neural Network is the most widely used algorithm for mining the association rules. In this paper, Artificial Neural Network is studied and optimized based on classification system. The performance of the ANN based on classification system is evaluated by varying number of generations and computing accuracy at different factors.

Three standard datum had been used to computer the accuracy. The test result shows that the system can give highest accuracy more than o.4.

I.  INTRODUCTION (HEADING 1) Datum mining plays a more important role in the  intelligent study making[1-3]. The aim of datum mining is to refine some important information that is mixed in the already exists databases. Classification is a method of datum analysis that is used to refine model for distinguishing important datum or predicting the data trends[4-6]. There are a lot of classification techniques to predict the trends of datum. Associative neural network that uses association rule mining among the refine rule process has shown powerful advantage than many other classification ways[7]. The aim of association rules is to refine frequent patterns, interesting correlations, casual construction or associations in sets of among the transaction datum[8]. In this paper, the technique for  neural classification using ANN system had been studied[9].



II. MATERIAL AND METHOD  A. System for ANN based on classification Artificial neural network system algorithms haves  salient features for the study method optimization. In the system the intelligent learning algorithm for ANN based on classification are used[10]. The schematic diagram of algorithm structure shows as Fig. 1. the all steps performed in algorithm in system are shown as blocks[11]. The structure of ANN algorithm is represented by Fig.2.

ANN algorithms process  B. Datum preprocess Experiment design is a classical method to search  optimal results in some domains[12]. Engineers and scientist make use of experiments to solve the sampling sequence in computer data storage and release. theory has been of both practical interest and great theoretical, especially theory integrate with the AN algorithm efficiently, this composite method is referred to as ANN.

ANN is divided in two stage, (1) algorithm construction related design; (2) algorithm construction free design.

Algorithm construction is approximate models of a system.

Construction models and calibration computer models are classical examples of model free designs. In this paper, model free sequence design methods for maximum sampling have been researched. The ED & GA free design  method was be used, because of considering computer construction models instead of physical phenomena.

The initial step is the datum preprocessing for neural  datum mining work. Preprocessing is done to arrange the data in a order that can be easily processed. Datum structure was in the order of models containing records.

All the models are referred to as pointers. The datum contains series of items called nodes. There are various nodes available for representing nodes in a transactional datum. The node in a datum can be represented as a primary string with items binary 1 and items absent are binary 0. Consider the following example just in Tab. 1 containing 8 nodes from T100 to T800. the datum after each node is considered as one node. Now the nodes are presented in primary representation with 5 row and 8 columns. The nodes present in a transaction are coded as primary I and the nodes absent are coded as primary 0.

Before processing the datum, the association regulation mining algorithm for making frequent nodes are applied. If the maximum support limit is 25% then Tab.1 shows the list of nodes based on support limit and corresponding confidence.

If the maximum confidence limit is 60% then Tab.II shows the list of nodes based on confidence.

IV. CLONING SELECTED REGULATION The basis of cloning rate is processed after finding  frequent node sets on basis of confidence and support limit. Tab.III shows the node of items which has to be preprocessed for each item sets.

CLONE PROCESSED FOR EACH ITEM SETS  1 2 3 4 5 11000 10100 1100 11100 11001 11000 10100 In the neural network association algorithm, the insert  rate of a node is the most important to the efficient of the node. It gives the way for each high affinity node to ?study? more in order to make better its affinity. In applications proposed goal, the mutation node is equal to rebirth for each cell. That is, when a cell is mutated, the newly processed regulation will differ from the traditional regulation only by one rule. Tab.V shows the mutated clones by one bit mutation.

V. NEURAL NETWORK DIVERSITY In order to use the diversity, the neural clone selection  algorithm updates the application method by processing some existing nodes with other ones.

Computer sampling sequence model had been studied deeply. Many processes are so difficult that physical theorem too expensive or too time consuming; or, as in the case of weather model, physical theorem may simply be possible. As a result, theorems have increasingly turned to model to compute the intricate structure. Advances in computational efficiency have been allowed both more extensive and greater complexity use of this model.

Actually in many region of technology and science is affected. Computer data codes often have many dimensional inputs, which would be scalars or functions, and the output can be multivariate. In particular, it is easy for the output to be efficiency-dependent function from which many responses are extracted. In the sequence of sampling systems, computer experiment is frequently the intricate approach to getting the solution plan. Typically, the sampling sequence model of system performance is built based on knowledge structure of how the model operates.

The support of regulation is the transactions including X and Y with intersect the number of all domain. While confidence is seen as generalization or usefulness. How often the regulation is done. Support measures the uncertainty relationship. How certain the regulation is done. Tab.VI shows the mutated clones with their confidence and support.

TABLE VI.  MUTATED CLONES WITH THE CONFIDENCE AND SUPPORT  Mutated lones support(%) confidence(%) 11000 42 55.34 10101 11 25 11100 18 44.935 10011 11 25 10100 42 55.34 11101 18 44.935   The neural network pruning process steps those  regulation which have already been replaced by the memory regulations. After counting confidence and support pruning is done to move the regulation of high measure. Tab.VII shows the pruned node sets on the basis of confidence and support limit.

TABLE VII.  PRUNED NODE SETS WITH CONFIDENCE AND SUPPORT  Pruned clones Support(%) Confiderce(%) 10101 11 25 1101 11 25  The selection preprocess adds low confidence regulation into the pool. As the maximal value of confidence limit may vary depending on the datum, there is no unfixed node for the maximal min-confidence that can be used to comply with regulation from the population.

Tab.VIII shows the regulation in the pool before the one generation.

TABLE VIII.  MAXIMAL REGULATION IN THE POOL BEFORE ONE GENERATION  11 12 13 14 15 Confidence  (%) 1 1 1 0 0 0 55.34 2 1 1 1 0 0 25 3 1 0 1 0 0 55.34 4 1 1 1 0 0 55.34 5 1 1 1 0 1 25  The header of the ANN file contains the relation name, a list of the head file and their types. An example head files on the standard ACIS datum looks like this:  % 1. Sources %      (a) Creator: A.N.N datum %      (b) Donor: Marshall Michael %      (c) Date: empty..empty % 2. Title: (company name) @ NUERAL NETWORK SYSTEM The datum of the ANN file looks like this: @DATUM\ 5.2, 3.5, 1.4, 0.3, ANN-SETS 4.8, 3.2, 1.3, 0.2, ANN-SETS 4.6, 3.1, 1.2, 0.18, ANN-SETS 4.5, 3.0, 1.1, 0.17, ANN-SETS

VI. CONCLUSION The three benchmark datum form the ANN system are  used to learning namely auto. The datasets vary in some of  samples, classes, number of attributes, number of items and in number of training and test datum. The auto is very large datasets. The auto datasets has 1987 samples with 1254 samples as training set and 587 samples as test result.
