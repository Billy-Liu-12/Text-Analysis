MANET Mining: Mining Step Association Rules

Abstract  Mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is a collection ofau- tonomous nodes or terminals that communicate with each other by forming a multihop radio network. These nodes maintain connectivity in a decentralized manner. MANET is characterized by a rapidly changed topology. As a result packets select different multi-hops paths to reach their des- tinations. Even though packets are somehow independent from each other, there are still some hidden relations (pat- terns) among them. These relations may be utilized to give useful information to different MANET protocols. In this work association rule technique is applied to obtain these hidden relations.

1. Introduction  Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) needs efficient distributed algorithms to determine network organization.

However, most of the algorithms-including broadcasting, multicasting, unicasting, electing a leader, determining vi- able routing paths, delivering keys-are not well-defined  1-4244-2575-4/08/$20.00 @2008 IEEE  problems. Accordingly, MANET algorithms are still imma- ture, and there is no doubt that the unpredictable topology (mobility) is the main reason for this immaturity.

One way to enhance MANET performance is to disclose the hidden characteristics (patterns) of MANET and to uti- lize them in the distributed algorithms. This can be achieved by analyzing the MANET traffic in a tempo-spatial domain.

In this work a new framework is proposed: Applying the association rules mining to the traffic in MANET. Such a technique paves the way for the other MANET algorithms to be implemented or integrated to the NS2 simulator [7].

In fact, Fosca and Dino gave general idea about the geo- graphic knowledge discovery and its effect on the individual privacy [3]. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: The second section describes the common aspects between MANET mining and data mining. The third section ex- plains the proposed framework. The fourth section shows the simulation and the results. The fifth section provides a conclusion for the paper and suggestions for future work.

2. Data mining is applicable to a database with a large number of transactions. MANET mining is applicable to a traffic with a large number ofpassing packets.

3. The purpose of mining association rules in a database is to discover all rules that have support and confi- dence (predictability) greater than or equal to the user- specified minimum support and minimum confidence.

The problem with mining association rules in MANET is to discover the most likely patterns (such as routes) among packets and the cooperated nodes.

4. Each frequent set in data mining maps different pack- ets with common hops along the path in MANET.

3. MANET Mining Domain  3.1. Introduction  Beside Bramer's notation [1], new structures and opera- tions have been defined in this section. Nodes in MANET mining need not read from a database. Each packet keeps track of the path it is following. Whenever the packet passes through a node, it adds that node's identity to the list of nodes traveled. As soon as the destination receives the packet it gets that list. The destination node adds this list (entry) to a table. In this work, this table is called the traffic table. The Traffic table contains all packets' lists received by a node for a specific time interval~. Thus, any node can get a sample of the traffic in MANET to construct its own traffic table without any request from any other node.

In other words, nodes do not add new traffic to MANET; they just capture passively the passing packets and check their lists. Now, nodes exploit traffic tables by applying  ...

The traffic table is condensed by coding the presence of each node with one bit.

3.2. Demonstration on a Simple MANET  This section explains how association rules mining is ap- plied to MANET. Association rules seek to identify what things go together [5]. Consider the scenario in Fig. 1.

There are 15 nodes in this ad hoc network. The node N I is the source and the node N 2 is the destina- tion. For simplicity, a small number of packets is con- sidered. The source sends 4 packets through the path < NI, N 3 , N 5 , N 6 , Ng, N14 , N 13 , N2 >. Then the topol- ogy changes. Nodes N 5 and N l4 leaves the route. Nodes N4 and N s enter the route, and the source sends 4 packets through the path < N I , N 3 , N 4 , N 6 , N g, N s, N 13 , N 2 >.

Again the topology changes. Node N g leaves. Node N l4 and node N l5 enter, and the remaining 4 packets follow the     Table 3. The Simulation Parameters  Number of the nodes 100 Routing protocol AODV, DSDV, DSR Mobility model Random way point  Pause time 1 second Radio transmission range 250 meters  Channel capacity 1 mbps Data flow constant bit rate  Data packet size 512 bytes Node placement random  Terrain area 1500m*1500m Simulation time 120 second  Propagation model Two Ray Ground Speed 5, 10,... , 50 m/sec  path < N!, N3, N4, N6, N 15 , N 14 , Ns , N 13 , N2 >. Now the traffic table in both the source and destination will be as in tables 1 and 2. Mining association rules is applied to this traffic table. Assume that the support s = 70%. Then ?7 = MFS = {Nl,N2,N3,N6,N13}.

The nodes in each frequent set are correlated with sup- port=70%.

Note that any subset of the maximum frequent set is a fre- quent set (according to the downward closure property [6]).

Note also that the association rules are derived from the MFS. Now onwards, it is enough to calculate the MFS.

4. Simulation and Results  New metric is defined in this section. It is defined as follows:  CorreZation- ratio(s) = #0f ~~~~o=:o~~eAf::Sj;tting  Parameter value  The higher ratio indicates better correlation among nodes. Before simulation, mining, and analysis of the traffic, the metric is applied to the demonstrated example for illustration. From the previous section, the MFS of the traffic table in tables 1 and 2 with support s = 70% is {N!, N2, N3, N6, N 13 }. The number of nodes in MFS is 5 and the number of nodes involved in routing in this traffic table is 11 (i.e. columns that contain at least one' 1' value).

Correlation_ratio(with s = 70%) = 1  In this example there are few nodes with few packets.

This means that the route from the source to the destina- tion gets changed in few nodes only. In a real scenario, more numbers of nodes may communicate for longer time; this results in huge number of packets (traffic) with low Correlation_ ratio. This is because the routes are com- pletely changed after some time. In other words, the number of common nodes decreases with passage of time. Accord- ingly, the CorreZation_ratio decreases.

One way to improve the Correlation _ratio is to mine the MANET traffic according to a threshold. This thresh- old represents the number ofroute changes (leaving/joining nodes) between any two consecutive entries in the traffic ta- ble. The threshold is denoted by the step.

For a closer view, the traffic table in tables 1 and 2 is split- ted into three traffic tables according to the threshold step=2 nodes. This means that the node starts accumulating the en- tries in the traffic table. Then it stops and mines when there are at least two changes. Accordingly, the first 5 entries saved in the first subtraffic table. The next 4 entries are saved in the second subtraffic table. The remaining entries are saved in the third subtraffic table. By mining these sub- traffic tables with the same support, the M F Ss are: MFS1 = {N1, N2,N3,N5,N6,Ng,N13, N 14}  MFS2 = {Nl,N2,N3,N4,N6,Ns,Ng,N13} MFS3 = {Nl,N2,N3,N4,N6,Ns,N13,N14,N15} Correlation_ratiol(s = 70) = ~ Correlation_ratio2(s = 70) = ~ Correlation-ratio3(s = 70) = 9 All these ratios are higher than the ratio taken for original traffic table.

Now, the MANET traffic is experimentally generated by the simulator NS2 [4] [2] and the used parameters are shown in Table 3.

The traffic table is splitted into subtraffic tables according to the threshold (step) and the Correlation _ratio is ob- tained from each subtraffic table. Then the mean for all the subtraffic tables is calculated.

Several parameters with their effects on MANETs mining are studied in this work.

Figures 3, 4 and 5 show the effect of the threshold (step) on the Correlation_ratio with s = 70%, 80%, and 90% respectively for AODV. Figures 6 and 7 show the ef- fect of the support s on the ratio with step=02 and 03 nodes respectively for AODV. Figures 8, 9 and 10 show the effect of the threshold on the Correlation _ratio with s = 70%, 80%, and 90% respectively for DSDV. Fig- ures 11 and 12 show the effect of the support s on the ratio with step=02 and 03 nodes respectively for DSDV.

Figures 13, 14 and 15 show the effect of the threshold on the Correlation_ratio with s = 70%, 80% and 90% respectively for D SR. Figures 16 and 17 show the ef- fect of the support s on the ratio with step=02 and 03 nodes respectively for DSR. The figures show high Correlation- ratios for the protocols with support higher than 70% and with step=2 and 3 nodes, except for the proto- col DS DVwhich has low Correlation _ratio because it is not reactive towards the change in the topology. The thresh- old for DSDV may be improved in further work.

For example, in this work a large number of the MANET nodes contribute to the building of the traffic ta- ble and only two nodes (the source and the destination) can apply the algorithm to this table. This idea can be uti- lized in the security ofMANET that needs a local algorithm works by a secret token generated by the help of a group of MANET nodes.

Figure 2 gives the position of MANET mining in the Ad hoc stack. The layers above the MAC layer may bene- fit , either directly or by the cross layer, from the proac- tive MANET mining technique at any time with both very reasonable storage-cost (bit-wise) and free of traffic-cost.

Furthermore, the off-the-shelfdata mining techniques come into the picture to save the computation-cost.
