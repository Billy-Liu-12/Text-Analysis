Abstract   Discovering association rules is one of the most  important tasks in data mining. The classical model of association rules mining is support-confidence, the interestingness measure of which is the confidence measure. The classical interestingness measure in association rules have existed some disadvantage. In this paper, some problem of interestingness measure on the classical association rules model have been analyzed, and then a new interestingness measure for mining association rules is proposed based on sufficiency measure of uncertain reasoning to improve the classical method of mining association rules. The property of the new interestingness measures is analyzed, which validity has been tested in this paper.

1. Introduction   Data Mining has been applied to broad range of activities that attempt to discover new implicit patterns and rules from existing information, and obtain interesting and useful knowledge. However, no each pattern and rule has significance. In order to determine whether a rule or pattern is interesting, it need a suitable metric to measure the degree of rule or pattern that customer is interested in. According to the quantified value, the uninteresting rules are crossed out. Therefore, the research on interestingness measure of rule is very importance of data mining [1, 2] .

Association rules are one of well-studied problems in data mining. The problem of finding association rule X Y was first introduced in 1993 by Agrawal et al [3].

In the classical framework, technical model of association rules mining is Support-confidence [4], which is described as follows:  Assume that I= {i1, i2,?, im } is the binary set ,where ij (j=1,2,?m) refers to as item. T denotes as transaction, which is the set of items and T?I. Suppose that X is the itemsets of I and X?T.

A association rule is the implication pattern as X?Y, where X?I, Y?I, and X?Y=?. The support of rule X Y in transaction database D is the proportion of the number of transaction including X and Y in transaction database D, which denotes as support(X Y), namely,  Support(X Y) =| {T|X?Y?T, T?D}|/|D|.

Confidence of rule X Y refers as the proportion of the number of transactions which include X and Y in transaction which include Y, denotes as confidence (X Y), namely,  Conf (X?Y) =| {T|X?Y?T?T?D}|/| {T|X?T? T?D}|  Given a transaction database D, mining association rules means that produce the rule which support and confidence is less than the minim support and minimum confidence that costumers give.

The classical model mentioned above is named as support-confidence framework which conf(X Y) measures interestingness of the rule X Y. In fact, this classical interestingness measure has much deficiency.

Several author [1, 2, 5] criticized the use of support- confidence framework. In this paper, some deficiency of interestingness measure on the support-confidence framework have been analyzed, and then a new interestingness measure for mining association rules is proposed based on sufficiency measure of uncertain reasoning to improve the classical method of mining association rules. The property of the new interestingness measure is analyzed. Its validity .has been analyzed in this paper.

This paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, some shortages in support-confidence framework are analyzed. A new interestingness measure is proposed in Section 3. In section 4, the property of new interestingness measure is analyzed. In Section 5, validity of new interestingness measure has been tested in some example. Conclusion is given in Section 6.

DOI 10.1109/WGEC.2008.34     2. Some shortages in support-confidence framework   In the data mining of association rulers in support- confidence framework, Conf (X?Y) is used to measure the interestingness of ruler X?Y. However, sometime this model retrieves the uncorrelated rulers and misleads to define interesting rule. Thus, there are some limitations on support-confidence framework.

The following examples illustrate some shortages in support-confidence framework.

Example 1[6]: There is a simple transaction table in the following. The rows denote as the transaction item and the columns stand for the transaction. The total number of transaction is eight.

X 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 Y 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 Z 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1  Clearly, from this table it can be observed that X and Y are positively correlated and that X and Z are negatively correlated. However, if we calculate the support and confidence of the rules X Y (25%, 50%) and X Z (37.5%, 75%), it turns out that the second rule dominates the first both in terms of support and confidence. This example demonstrates that high confidence should not be confused with high correlation and one should be very careful in defining the interestingness of rules in terms of support- confidence framework.

Example 2 [7]: Suppose we have market basket data from a grocery store, consisting of n baskets. Let us focus on the purchase of tea and coffee. In the following table, rows t and t  correspond to baskets that do and do not, respectively, contain tea, and similarly columns c and c  correspond to coffee. The numbers represent percentage of baskets.

c c  Total t 20  5 25  t  70 75 75 Total 90 10 100  Let us apply the support-confidence framework to the potential association rule t ? c. The support for this rule is 20%, which is fairly high in practical case.

The confidence is defined to be the conditional probability that a customer buys coffee, given that she buys tea, i.e., P[t?c]/P[t] = 20/25 = 0.8 or 80%, which too is pretty high. At this point, we may conclude that the rule t? c is a valid rule.

However, consider now the fact that the a priori probability that a customer buys coffee is 90%. In other words, a customer who is known to buy tea is less likely to buy coffee (by 10%) than a customer about whom we have no information. Of course, it may still  be interesting to know that such a large number of people who buy tea also buy coffee, but stating that rule by itself is at best incomplete information and at worst misleading. The truth here is that there is a negative correlation between buying tea and buying coffee; at least that information should be provided along with the association rule t ? c. One way of measuring correlation is to compute P[t?c]/(P[t] ? P[c]) = 0.2/(0.25 x 0.9) = 0.89. The fact that this quantity is significantly less than 1 indicates negative correlation, since the numerator is the actual likelihood of seeing a customer purchase both tea and coffee, and the denominator is what the likelihood would have been in the case when the two purchases are completely independent.

In the above example, there are exist shortages in the model of support-confidence. Thus, it needs to improve the model of support-confidence. In the rest of this paper, we will propose a new model to measure the confidence based on sufficiency measure of uncertain reasoning. The new measure not only captures correlation but can also detect negative implication.

Furthermore, we also study some properties of the new measure and point out its validity.

3. A new interestingness measure of association rules  3.1 Some related conceptions on association rules.

In order to represent the new interestingness measure, the following conceptions are given.

Definition 1: P(X) refers to as probability of occurrence of itemsets X in transaction database D; P (~X) denotes as probability of incurrence of itemsets X in the transaction database D, and P(~X)=1-P(X); P(X?Y) denotes as probability of occurrence of itemsets X and Y in the mean time. If P(X?Y) =P(X)P(Y), then itemsets X and Y is independent in the transaction. Suppose P(X?Y) ?P(X)P(Y) ? then itemsets X and Y is interdependent. From this, the same definition extends to X, Y, Z. If P(X?Y?Z) = P(X)P(Y)P(Z) ? then X, Y, Z is independence. If P(X?Y?Z) ?P(X)P(Y)P(Z) ? then X, Y, Z is interdependent.

Definition 2: Consider ruler X Y. If P(X?Y) =P(X) P(Y), then itemsets X and Y is independent. If P(X?Y)> P(X)P(Y), then itemsets X and Y is positive correlation. If P(X?Y?< P(X)P(Y), then itemsets X and Y is negative correlation.

3.2. Sufficiency measure on rule and its attribute   R.O. Duda and P.E. Hart [8] proposed Subjective Bayes Method based on Bayes theory in 1976, and build corresponding uncertain inference model. In his model, a conception to quantify the sufficiency of rule X Y, named as sufficiency measure, have been proposed, which is as follow:  Definition 3: Consider ruler X Y, the formula  )~/( )/( YXP  YXPLS =   is the sufficiency measure of ruler X Y which be denoted as LS.

The sufficiency measure quantifies the correlation of antecedent and consequent of rule X Y. In the following, we deduce two theorems on sufficiency measure and give their proof:  Theorem 1: The antecedent X and consequent Y of rule X Y is independent if and only if LS=1; X and Y is positive correlation if and only if LS>1; X and Y is negative correlation if and only if LS<1; Proof: LS=1?P(X/Y)/P(X/~Y) =1 ?P(X?Y)/P(Y) =P(X?~Y)/P (~Y)  ?P(X?Y)/P(Y)=(P(X)-P(X?Y))/(1- P(Y))?P(X?Y)(1-P(Y))=(P(X)-P(X?Y))P(Y) ?P(X?Y)=P(X)P(Y)?X and Y is independent?  The other two results can be proved in the same procedure.

? Theorem 2: The value range of LS is [0??).

Proof:  Because 0?P?X/Y??1?0?P(X/~Y) ?  1? P?X?=P?X/Y?+P(X/~Y) ?  Thus,0?P(X) ?1?and )~/( )/(  YXP YXPLS =  .

So, the value range of LS is [0??).

? Theorem 1 tell us how to determined whether a rule  X Y is correlating form its sufficiency measure, and know the correlation degree of the antecedent X and consequent Y of rule X Y.

3.3. New interestingness measure of Associate Rules.

From Theorem 2, the value LS cannot quantify the  correlation of rule X Y, because the interval [0, 1] represents the degree of negative correlation while the interval [1, ?) stands for the degree of positive correlation. Thus, the two intervals are asymmetric. For better depict the correlation of a rule, a new interestingness measure is introduced as follow:  Definition 4: Define P(X/Y) - P(X/~Y) as the new confidence of ruler X Y. and name it as NConf(X Y).

According to above definition and Theorem 1, it is derived that LS=1? NConf(X Y)=0 ? LS>1? NConf(X Y)>0?LS<1? NConf(X Y) <0; So the following theorem is obtained :  Theorem 3: The range of NConf(X Y) is [-1?1].

If NConf(X Y) =0, X and Y is independent. If NConf(X Y)<0, X and Y is negative correlation, If NConf(X Y)>0, X and Y is positive correlation.

From the theory above, the classical support- confidence framework can be revised as follows: Suppose I is item Set of transaction database D, and X ?Y?I?X?Y=??P(X)?0? minsupp and minconf is the minimum support and minimum confidence of ruler X Y which is positive. So, the following results are given.:  (1).If p(X?Y)?minsupp, NConf(X Y) ?minconf, then X Y is interesting positive ruler.

(2).If p(~X?Y) ? minsupp, NConf(X Y) ? - minconf, then X Y is interesting negative ruler.

Where NConf(X Y)=P(X/Y) - P(X/~Y).

4. The properties of the new interestingness measure   Piatetsky-Shapiro[9] has proposed three key  properties that a good measure M should satisfy.

Consider the interestingness of rule X Y to be evaluated by the interestingness measure M, the three key properties is followings: P1: M=0 if X and Y are statistically independent; P2: M monotonically increase with P(X?Y) when P(X) and P(Y) remain the same; P3: M monotonically decreases with P(X) (or P(Y)) when the rest of the parameters (P(X?Y) and P(Y) or P(X)) remain unchanged.

We can easily test whether the new interestingness measure NConf(X Y) satisfies the key three properties. From Definition 4, it suppose that M(X Y) =P(X/Y) - P(X/~Y). Based on Theorem 3, M=0 if X and Y are statistically independent, so the property P1 is  satisfied. Because P(X/Y) - P(X/~Y) =.

( ) ( ~ )  ( ) (~ ) P X Y P X Y  P Y P Y ? ?? ,  we can easily see that properties P2 and P3 are satisfied for the new interestingness measure. There are other properties [10] for the new interestingness measure to satisfy as follows.

Property 4: [Asymmetric measures] By the definition 4, it can be derived that NConf(X Y) ? NConf(Y X). Thus, the new interestingness measure is asymmetric measures, namely, the new measure is used for implication rules where there is a need to     distinguish between the strength of the rule X Y from Y X.

Property 5:  [Row/Column Scaling Invariance] Assume that a contingency tables P=[f11  f12; f21  f22] is a 2?2 square matrix; Let R=C=[k1 0;0 k2] be a 2?2 square matrix, where k1 and k2 are positive constants. It can be derived that NConf(RM)=NConf(M) and NConf(MC)=NConf(M).So it can be deem that NConf is Row/Column Scaling Invariance according to the literature [10]   5. The test of the new interestingness measure.

5.1. Test of example   At first, we compute the interestingness measure of  example 1 and example 2 with the new method to test its validity. For example 1, NConf(X Y)=1/3, while NConf(X Z)=-6/7. So, rule X Y is positive correlative, and rule X Z is negative correlative.

Therefore, the value computed with new method is consistent with actual case. For example 2, NConf(buy cola) buy cheese)= -0.108. The resulting value is negative, which represents that the occurrence of Buy cola is negative impact on occurrence of Buy cheese, which is different from the result obtained by support- confidence framework, but is better appropriate with practical data. Except for the support?confidence framework, there some other metric to measure interestingness of association rules, such as Conviction, Lift, Leverage, Coverage, Correlation and Odd Ratio which can be referred to the literature [6, 11, 12] . This section compares all the measures including the new interestingness measure proposed in the section 3. We  have chosen a data set on which we have performed the A-priori algorithm [4] to find out the frequent item set.

All the measure is applied on each of the frequent item set.

The sample data (see Table 1) for the analysis purpose is taken from a store database of customer transactions there are six different types of items and a total of ten transactions. In each transaction a 1 represents the presence of an item while a 0 represents the absence of an item from the market basket.

Table 1: Sample Transactions TID Items A B C D E F 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 2 1 0 1 1 0 1 3 1 0 1 1 0 1 4 0 1 1 1 0 0 5 0 1 0 1 1 0 6 1 0 0 0 1 1 7 1 0 1 0 1 1 8 0 0 1 0 0 0 9 0 1 1 1 0 0 10 1 1 0 1 1 0 Total 6 5 6 7 4 5 P(X) 0.6 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.4 0.5  The frequent item set generated by the sample data using A-priori algorithm [4] is shown in the following table 2:  Table 2: Frequent Itemsets Itemsets Support {A,D} 40% {A,F} 50% {B,D} 50% {C,D} 40%  All measures are calculated for each rule in table 2, which is output of the A-priori algorithm. The results are shown in table 3   Table 3: Calculation of Different Measures on Sample Datasets  Rules Support Confidence Conviction Lift Leverage Coverage Correlation Odds Ratio NConf  A?D 0.40 0.67 0.50 0.95 -0.02 0.57 -0.09 0.67 -0.095 A?D 0.40 0.57 0.83 0.95 -0.02 0.67 -0.09 0.67 -0.083 A?F 0.50 0.83 1.00 1.67 0.20 1.00 0.82 ? 0.800 F?A 0.50 1.00 0.80 1.67 0.20 0.83 0.82 ? 0.833 B?D 0.50 1.00 0.60 1.43 0.15 0.71 0.65 ? 0.714 D?B 0.50 0.71 1.00 1.43 0.15 1.00 0.65 ? 0.600 C?D 0.40 0.67 0.50 0.95 -0.02 0.57 -0.09 1 -0.095 D?C 0.40 0.57 0.67 0.95 -0.02 0.67 -0.09 1 -0.083   From the table 3, it can be seen that Nconf is equivalence to the some measure, such as Leverage, Correlation, which have taken consideration of the negative correlation. For example, see the rules A D, A D, C D, D C. The rules are negative correlation,  which can see intuitively from sample table. Moreover, if the rules are positive, the evaluating result with NConf is accord with the other metric of measure, which can be shown by the rules A?F, F?A, B?D and D?B.

6. Conclusion   The works of this paper propose a new model to measure the confidence of association rules based on sufficiency measure of uncertain reasoning, which overcome some shortages of the metric of the classical model support-confidence framework. The new measure not only captures correlation but can also detect negative implication. We have study some properties of the new measure and test its validity.

Furthermore, the new measure can be used to mine the negative rules. The study of how to mine the negative rules with the new interestingness measure is the future works.
