An Intelligent Agent for Personalized E-Learning

Abstract  When people browse the learning materials on a web site, the sequence of content they browse might not have any particular relations.  Therefore, the proposed research tries to build an intelligent agent for discovering a specific learner's interests in different knowledge fields dynamically, instead of finding the sequence of content he browses.  Na?ve Bayesian Classifier (NBC for short) is used as the approach of prospecting and analyzing learner's interests.  Push technology is applied to do recommendation of new coming learning materials based on the suggestion obtained by NBC.  The simulation results show the power of the proposed intelligent agent.

1. Introduction  Owing the development of network and the shortcomings of traditional in-class learning mode, the way of learning has already from physical classrooms to virtual on-line learning.  How to provide an effective learning in such a virtual environment becomes a hot and important issue recently.

Intelligent agent is a new developing technology and concept of the last ten years.  It usually applies to e-commerce, e-learning, electronic government, and digital library.  Intelligent agent is a program that can execute repeating and expectable missions.  The characteristics of intelligent agent are autonomy, social ability, adaptability, and reaction.  So it can make proper actions and response to the change of the environment without the participation of users.

As one kind of intelligent agents, the agents of e- learning can perceive the change of environment and then adopt corresponding actions voluntarily.  They operate independently and execute tasks by particular ability.  According to the roles of agents, there are three kinds of agents for e-learning [1] [2]:  ? Personal Agent A personal agent fetches different information  according to different users' demands.  In the on- line learning environment, the system offers very scattered materials and users have to browse these materials one by one in order to get their interesting information.  The agent is responsible for compiling the scattered information and recommending users' interesting materials to them voluntarily when they login next time.

? Tutor Agent A tutor agent offers help of operations in proper  time whenever users call for help.  It is a headache that users need to search and discover their interesting materials when they are not familiar with the on-line learning environment.  The tutor agents will provide proper and essential operations to help them reduce the mental fear.

? Information Agent Users need to provide their demands to agents  before agents collect users' personal interesting information.  The agent has to collect users' personal interests and give fast response according to the pre-specified demands of users.

The personal agent can discover users' personal  interests voluntarily without bothering the users.  It is very suitable for personalized e-learning by voluntarily recommending learning materials.  The major work of personal agent in e-learning can be divided into two categories: ? Adopt the association rules to analyze the browsing  sequence.  Then give suggestion of composing learning materials and sequence of learning in order to reduce the time of searching and provide high quality learning materials.

? Analyze users' browsing profile to understand their learning status.  Then offer information to teachers or instructors or learners in order to improve students' learning performance by proper guiding.

Sparapani (1996) thinks analyzing the users' profile  is an efficient method to measure the performance of   DOI 10.1109/ISDA.2008.250     learning.  It can help to understand how much effort the users have paid for the learning materials.  Wen- Shen Chen (2003) thinks teachers or instructors can understand the characteristics of users from the users' profile without interfering with the users' learning [3].

Most agents of e-learning are set up the best learning rules and the way of analyzing in advance [4]~[10].  Moreover, they are constructed based on the standpoints of system developers or teachers.  These agents analyze the browsing sequence of users and they assume the order of the content that users have browsed has some kind of relations.  Under the prerequisites, the analyzing results are only suitable for some specific fields.  On the other hand, if agents adopt association rule, they assume users' browsing sequence has some kind of relation.  There are a lot of researches have shown highly efficient performance about how to analyze the relations between learning fields and courses.

The proposed personal agent try to analyze the users' profile, which is recorded via their browsing sequence, without assuming the relation of users' browsing sequence and setting rules for discovering users' interests in advance.  Since Na?ve Bayesian Classifier (NBC for short) assumes all input items are independent and perform analyzing fast, it is very suitable for our intelligent agent.  Then the system will recommend new learning materials, by email or display on the web site when the user login next time, according to the results which are suggested by the NBC module.  In other words, the push technology is applies in our system.

2. Problem definition  The proposed research constructs an intelligently personal agent.  The agent can not only discover the interests of learning materials for on-line learners but also recommend their interesting materials voluntarily.

The goal of the proposed agent is to recommend learning materials for on-line learners as accurate as possible.  The problem model that we discuss is following:  niforNRMNINRM  niforRMIRM  niforLMNRMRM  toSubject  n  NRM  NINRM  RM  IRM  Maximize  ii  ii  ii  n  i i  i  i  i  ...1  ...1  ...1  :   100*  :  ?? ?? ???  ? ? ?  ? ? ?     ??  ?  (1)  Where IRMi: the set of learning materials that the  proposed agent recommends and the user i interests too.

LM: the set of learning materials in the system.

n: the total number of users NINRMi: the set of learning materials that the  proposed agent does not recommend and the user i does not interest either.

NRMi: the set of learning materials that the proposed agent does not recommend for user i.

RMi: the set of learning materials that the proposed agent recommends for user i.

Since we construct an intelligently personal agent to discover the interesting learning fields for each different user, we have the following assumptions: ? The on line web learning system have the  capability to manage its members.

? The learning materials discussed here contain the  information of leaning fields which they belong to.

The number of learning fields is eight and these fields are classified according to The Ministry of Education in Taiwan for grade one to twelve [11].

These include language, mathematics, science and natural technology, sociology, healthy and physical education, life, arts and culture, and comprehensive activities.

3. Approach  In order to recommend learning materials as accurate as possible, the proposed agent first needs to discover users' personal interests precisely.  Then recommendations can be done voluntarily and efficiently.  So the proposed ?Intelligent Agent for Personalized E-Learning? has two major sub-systems: ? Analysis system  We adopt Na?ve Bayesian Classifier (NBC for short), combined the database of browsing profile and NBC, as the analysis method to discover users' interest.  This algorithm is fast and the input factors are independent, so it can increase agent's efficiency and accuracy while analyzing the data [12].

? Recommendation system According to the result analyzed by NBC, when  the system has the new learning materials, which is users' personal interests, the agent will recommend them to user voluntarily.  There are two ways to inform the users about these learning materials which are recommended by the proposed system.

One way is by email for all of the users in the web site when the system has new coming learning materials.  The other way to inform the user is when the user login the system.

The proposed intelligently personal agent acts in two modes.  One is when users login and browse the on-line web site, the other is when users login and upload new learning materials.  The processing and data flow of the proposed system is shown in Figure 1.

Black arrows denote the flow of processing.  A blue arrow denotes data flow from a database to a process module.  To store data into a database is denoted by a green arrow.  The cyan dotted arrow means the process module may read data from the database and may also write data into the database.  The purple-cyan rectangles denote the modules to perform recommendation and yellow-cyan rectangles represent the modules to analyze users' interests.  The green- cyan cylinders are the databases that we use to implement the personalized e-learning system.

Figure 1. The processing and data flow of the proposed system  There are six modules and five databases to support the personalized e-learning system.  The system starts when any user successfully login the on line learning web site.  In the beginning, the "Display learning materials" module will perform.  The module not only display regular web information but also the learning materials, which are discovered by the analysis system for the specified user, based on the information stored in "learning materials" and "recommending  information" database.  In the same time, the module also updates the database of "recommending information" by deleting these recommending materials which have displayed on the current web page.  After the content of web page has shown, the particular user can upload learning materials or browse any web page in the learning web site.

If the login user uploads learning materials, the "Search new learning materials" module will search new learning materials for all of users in the learning web site, since they login the web site last time.  Then the "Recommend learning materials" module finds out these new learning materials for each user according to his interests.  If there are learning materials that conform to the users' interests, the agent will write the information into the database of "recommending information".  Then the "Push information to users" module will voluntarily notice these users there are new learning materials, which are their interests, on the learning web site by email.

The "Record users browsing profile" and "Analyze users interests" modules take in charge of discovering users' interests.  The former is responsible for collecting and recording all of the browsed learning materials until the user exits the web site.  In the proposed system, we record the following information for each login period according to the user ID,   the session ID, and the learning fields.

? the total browsing time of web pages which are  learning materials ? the total number of visits for web pages which are  learning materials (the number of visits is counted by the number of entering a web page and does not care whether the user visit the same web page or not)  ? the number of different web pages have been browsed  ? the learning fields of these browsed web pages An example of the content of database of browsing profile for a particular user in one of his login period is shown in Table 1.   The row one, which has yellow as the background color, denotes the particular user spent 256 seconds to enter web pages eight times for browsing six different web pages whose learning field is science.  Row two and three denote the browsing information about the learning field of arts and life respectively.

Table 1. An example of the content of database of browsing profile  type Time of  browse (sec.) Number of visits  pages of browse  Scienc e  256 8 6     Arts 136 3 2 Life 63 2 1  The "Analyze users interests" module will be active when users exit the web site.  The module, implemented according to Na?ve Bayesian Classifier (NBC for short), can discover the users' personally interesting learning fields among these on-line learning materials.  It analyzes the data from database of browsing profile and NBC such that the system can discover interesting learning fields for different users.

Table 2 shows the partial content of database of NBC for a particular learner.  Row 1, which has yellow as the background color, means the user has interest in a learning field "A" if he spent 87 seconds in these pages whose learning field is "A", the number of visits for learning field "A" is 5, and the number of different pages had been browsed for learning field "A" is 2.

Row 2 and 3 are another combination of users' total browsing time, total number of visits, total pages of different web pages, and information of interest or not within a different login period, respectively.

Simulation and discussion  The proposed personalized e-learning system was installed into an on-line learning web site in the real world such that the performance of proposed intelligently personal agent can be evaluated.  The web site is implemented by PHP 5.1.6 with Apache 2.0.52 as web server and MySQL 4.1.2 as database server.

The analysis system is working on Windows XP with core2 duo T5600 1.83G CPU and 2G RAM.  Currently, the web site has more than thirty thousand users but only around 5% of them are often active.  The amount of learning materials, including text, image, audio, animation, and video, is about 23662.  We started to collect the users' browsing profile since the beginning of March 2008.

Figure 2 shows an output of the NBC for a particular user.  It performs the NBC with the interval of browsing time is set to 30, the interval of the number of visits is set to 3, the interval of the number of different pages has been browsed is set to 5, and the threshold value of NBC is set to 0.8.  The output told  us the particular user has interesting in "science", but he is not interesting in "Arts" or "Life".

Figure 2. An output of the NBC for a particular user  On the other hand, the accuracy of the proposed system is shown in Figure 3.  The interval of browsing time is 300, the interval of the number of visits is 5, the interval of the number of different pages has been browsed is 3, and the threshold value of NBC is 0.8 in Figure 3.  Each case denotes the average of 50 users or so.  The number of records in the browsing profile is between 50 and 100 and the number of learning fields is less than 3 for case 1.  Case 2 has more number of learning fields and has more than one hundred records of browsing.  Case 3 ~ Case 5 have the number records of browsing less than 50 and the number of learning fields is around 5.  The blue, pink, and yellow lines represent that we use 40%, 50%, and 60% of the records in browsing profile as the training data for NBC, respectively.

Figure 3. The accuracy of the proposed personalized E-learning     From Figure 3, someone can easily find that the more training data the system can obtain the higher accuracy the system supports.  It is also obvious that the user has focus on fewer learning field, the system can make more accurate recommendation.  The system can still have 50% accuracy even the records of browsing data is rare.  Since our system records the users' browsing information about one month until now, the system does not have enough data to training the proposed analysis system, which is based on NBC.

We believe the performance of the proposed system will be enhanced when the databases of browsing profile and NBC are growing.

5. Conclusion  The proposed research tries to construct an intelligent agent for personalized e-learning.  The agent has two major roles.  One is to discover the users' personal interesting in learning fields.  The other is to voluntarily recommend new learning materials according each user's interests.  The agent is embedded in the on-line learning web site and starts to work when any user successfully login the web site.  Besides, there are five databases need to maintain in order to complete the mission of personalized e-learning.

The performance of the proposed system is evaluated by the accuracy of recommendations, which are done by the proposed analysis system.  From the simulations, we found the agent can have more than 80% accuracy when there is enough browsing information and users have concentrated on few learning fields.  The accuracy is around 50% even the records of browsing information is rare, which is less than 50.

We will keep collecting the users' browsing information and enlarging the database of Na?ve Bayesian Classifier (NBC for short).  Then we can have stronger evidence to proof the performance of the proposed "Intelligent Agent for Personalized E- Learning" system.  Moreover, the intelligent agent will make the push technology more practical for applications in the real world and has it as the good way to popularize the on-line learning web site.
