Light-Ion Production for Medium-Energy Heavy-Ion  Interactions

Abstract- The unique radiation present in space is hard to completely reproduce for applications such as those needed for  testing new shielding materials. Instead, the testing procedures  involve transport model calculations that can simulate this  radiation environment. Because these codes rely on  experimental cross section data for validation and verification,  it becomes necessary to expand or improve the cross section  libraries in order to improve the accuracy of the models'  predictions.

There is a critical need for light-ion production cross section  measurements, including neutron, proton, deuteron, triton, 3He  and alpha particles. To help answer that need, we have  analyzed data from a series of previously conducted, medium?  energy heavy-ion experiments. The experiments of interest  were run at the Heavy-Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba  (HIMAC) facility involving various, medium-energy particle  beams and target materials. The experiments were designed to  observe neutrons that fragmented from the beam particles to  provide measurements for energy and angular dependent cross  sections. Although the experiments were originally designed  for neutrons, clever manipulation of the data allowed for the  same information to be measured for charged light-ion  fragments. The advantage of this information is the ability to  compare neutron and proton fragmentation cross sections  using identical experimental conditions without the need for  setting up another experiment.

This paper details the analysis of several runs of data collected  from the HIMAC experiments. The detectors used in the  experiments were arranged in various angles ranging from 10 to 80 degrees off of the beam axis. Analysis includes using pulse height measurements in conjunction with time-of-flight  measurements to discriminate between particle type and  energy. The final results of the data analysis provided energy  and angular dependent cross sections for protons, deuterons,  and tritons for various beam types and target materials.
