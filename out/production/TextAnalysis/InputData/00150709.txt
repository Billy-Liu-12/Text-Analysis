U4.12  NEW PASSIVE TRACKING ALGORITHMS USING POUXR INFORMATION

ABSTRACT  Tracking systems make both detection and position estimation of targets through time association of the received data , performed from the targets kinematic models . In Passive situations the bearing information do not permit to track low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) targets . The received signals power can however be used for the data association as it is in the Tracks Decision Rule .

power , especially when the signal power estimate is biased . We then present a tracks initiation algorithm using a global Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MU) , and a filter derived from the Probabilistic Data Association Filter (PDAP) , including the signal Power and Detection probability (Pd) estimates . Results will be presented in the frame of a Monte Carlo simulation with a Track Detection criterion .

This will be checked with the association test  1. Introduction  This paper will cope with the single source Tracking Problem , generally presented as .a filtering of tracks updated with measurements present in a gate around the predicted value , at each scan one coming from the target (if detected) and the others being false alarms , originating from self or medium noise .

This is known as the uncertain correlation problem solved by associating the correct updates .

Both data association and filtering are generally made only with the target estimated kinematics and measured positions , as bearing (e) in passive broadband sonar . Then one uses the track power'in order t o  make a decision on tracks confidence .

Let z be the measurement vector , X the state vector .

we but cannot choose the natural Cartesian equation x = y = 0 in unobservable passive systems .

with the state vector X = ( 8 , e  ,..., er ) t ,  r = 1,2,3 The obtained linear filter is preferred to the one issued from the exact equation 8 = 36/$ - 2$ (3 )  Assuming Linear Constant Speed (LCS) motion .

(1)  We use the approximated model,: e ( r * l )  = 0 (2)  The motion model at scan k is so  X(k+l) = A(k) X(k) + V(k) (4)  If r = 2 , Ct(k) = (l,O,O), A(k) = [:l:;"] 0,1,T where Ct is C matrix transpose , T is the time analysis period , V and W are centered gaussian processes with known covariance The uncertain correlation modifies (5), as each z in 2, = (z,,..,~,) , the population in the gate , is a candidate for z(k) .

A Nearest Neighbour Association ("A) method chooses one particular zi in 2, , then (4),(5) are solved by the classical Kalman Filter , while a Bayesian or Probabilistic method (111) computes an average of all the association hypothesis : X(k) = E(X(k)/ Zk) = Z X(k,i) @(k,i) (7) where  B(k,i) = P( z(k) = zi) are computed using Baye's rule and a priori knowledge of Pd .

It seems natural in order to select zi and compute B(k,i) to use all the available information , say both the position and the SNR as is done in the, tracks decision rule .

This will be checked in the next section .

We then present a track initiation technique using sliding bearing gates and MLE , and also a track statistics calculation .

we develop the PDASI algorithm derived from the Probabilistic Data Association (PDA , [l]) and using the Signal Information , including estimates of the signal power and of Pd which is not a priori known in automatic surveillance systems .

Detection curves are then presented for NNA , PDA, and PDASI , using our initiation algorithm .

2. Data association tests  (6)  i  In a fourth part  Given a measurement z., we test that it is a false alarm or a true one . We will compare two tests . The first one uses only the bearing and the second one uses both the bearing and the SNR .

The first test considers z = 8 , with hypothesis H, : 8 is from the target, normally distributed with known mean and unknown covariance uB2 .

'!n the prediction gate of width A I 2p0, . : 8 is a false alarm , with uniform bearing In the second test , z r  = (e,s)t .

Then H', = 8, and s follows a reduced normal law A', = 8, and s is normal with mean so and covariance 02 ( N(s,u) ) , s # 0 , U > 1  At low SNR and with a large number of frequency channels , U = 1 , but the mean s is unknown .

Consider first we get a biased estimate for s .

we compare the two ratios :  - 1437 - CH2977-7/91/0000-1437 $1.00 0 1991 IEEE    M' = d t  3. Tracks initiathn    Here , Z = (zl,..zp) is the set of measurements in the frame , with zi - ( e i , s i )  .

Without using signals , the MLE is a linear regression In general , we can write  estimate on 8 and 6 .

L(e,,s,/ B,e,e ,s)  = ue, H , e , e , S , S i )  L(s,/ H,S)  (24) Moreover , the variance of Bi can be written  uei2 = g (e ,s ,s i )  (25) , as the bearing error depends on the target strength , the corresponding peak when used for conditionning , and the bearing when the array is not cylindrical .

This function can be calculated in broadband , as the (integrated) output signals are gaussian, from their two first moments and the bearing estimation rule .

For each t in y , we compute  Then , let ll,..,lm be the likelihoods of tracks tl,. . , t, defined as (26) for H = (til,..timH) , mA < m  mR L(Z/ H )  P (1 1, . W L (z/ E,) (27)  j=1 3 zcH  If we consider as tracks the single measurements with t m q k  E (zk) , k = l,..,p then for each H , L(Z/ H )  = 1 L(t/ H )  (28)  t cH we set q = m + p , and 1 = (ll,..,lq)t , we will conclude as in [ 3 ]  . The hypothesis H is associated to a vector :  I (T~,..,T~)~ , where Ti is 1 if ti is in H , and 0 otherwise . Then , L(Z/ H )  = ~ ~ . l  (29) The problem is to maximize this product , with the constraint (assuming resolved targets) that the tracks are disjoint , which may be written  Where A is the matrix (aij) , 1 _< i _< p ai E 1 if zi is in t5 , 0 otherwise ana 1 stands for the q vector made of 1 .

T  A.T 5 1 (30)  1 < j  < s  It is solved with a classical 0-1 Programming algorithm .

Resolution of (25) leads to a real functional equation ( with a polynomial approximation for function g in (25)  ) . A more simple approach (also used for beginning the preceding search) consists in separately estimating s, (the mean of si in the Gaussian case) , and ( e , e )  as a Linear Regression , with weights as (25) .

Consider the choice between the hypothesis E1 : ( t is a true track 1 and HO : ( t is made of false alarms , uniform in  [-Pa, Pal 1 (so not using the s parameter value) .

Asymptotically (for large n) , if e = 0 , one would choose E l  if  (31) will generally be realized if A is the entire volume , and thus creates too much false tracks .

P 5 4 6 In (Nu42nJ (31)  4. Filtering  Derived from (7) , the PDA Filter equations are Kalman filter's , except the estimated covariance which is increased in order to hold the uncertain correlation contained in Pd and @ (k,i) .

The main approximation of the PDA is that the state estimate is Gaussian , which permits the recursion , since the processes are not Markovian like in Linear Filtering and an optimal solution would thus need all the given data computation .

When using the signal power estimate, we likewise  must know its law , exactly or approximately .

The assumption we make , and will question later is that it is Gaussian too .

We can then calculate the parameters : Let m, be the number of points in the gate , sk-l the estimated SNR , X,,,-, the predicted target position , P, its covariance , and let Hk,i be the assumption that z(k) = zi . Then ,  B(k,i) = p( Hk,i 1 mk,Zk,Xkyk-1,PKsSK-1 (32)  E a p( zk SK,HX,i,mk,Xk/Y-l,PP,s~-l ) .

P( s k  1 H x , ~ , ~ ~ , S K - ~  ) - P(Hk,i/mk,Sk-i) (33)  We assume Pd = $(s) (34) If we use a threshold detection on the (Gaussian) signal ,  (35) where N(s,y) is the s mean normal law value in y . Pd = S y t r  N(~,Y) dY sk-l is assumed Gaussian , with covariance u(k)2 P(Hk,i/mk,ak-i) E 1. p(s/sk-,) P(Hk,i/s,mk) (36)  = 1. p(s , - , / s )  $(s)/m, ds , i # 0 1. p(S,-,/S) [1 - Ms)l ds 9 i = 0 (37)  The calculation of the second factor of (34) gives -112 [ ~ ~ - ~ ~ / u ( k ) ~  + si2, /ui2]  P(S,/Hk,i,m,,Sk-l) = e  112 2 [s,-l/u(k)2 + s i / u i 2 ] Z . e  . d 4 2 n  (38) with  The  1 / 2  = l/u(k)2 + l / u i 2  first factor is derived as usually , with ue depending on s .

We use as the estimate for s at scan k :  k SR + (k-1)Sk-i + E B(k,i) s,,i (39)  We did not assume Pd known but the knowledge of the detection function 0 in ( 3 4 )  is necessary .

The estimated SNR s, is asymptotically normal (it can be seen from (39) with the Lindeberg condition for the Central Limit Theorem [4]  , for large k).

Moreover, although the estimate so issued from the track initiation algorithm is itself Gaussian , the assumption is not yet true when beginning the B parameters computation (33) . The use of a global estimate for s, is then required , with for example the study of the (bimodal) signal-noise mixture law , obtained when taking all the points in the successive bearing gates .
