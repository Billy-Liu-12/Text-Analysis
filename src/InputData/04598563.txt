I. INTRODUCTION With the fast development of Chinese Economy and the  improvement of economic structure, its domestic logistics industry develops rapidly at the same time. The requirement emphasis of the Logistic under current Chinese economy situation is switching from largely focused on quantity to qualityof domestic economy is converting from the quantity to the quality. The modern logistics can lower the economy operating cost, promote the economic operating quality, carry out the economize growth mode, and guarantee the sustainable development of economy.

The development of modern logistics in China is severely imbalanced. The modern logistics industry is highly developed in the eastern coastal region, which has become the cornerstone industry in Zhujiang Delta such as Shenzhen and Guangzhou, and it is also advanced in Changjiang Delta such as Shanghai and Suzhou. The modern logistics industry mutual related and the local economy development are closely inter-correlated and promoted with the local economy.

The logistics industry is still unenlightened in lots of cities in the western region of China, with still applying the traditional logistic model, so it which is not well balanced between the economy and the logistics.

It is important to do a research of the coupling mechanism between urban economy and logistics, in order to find out their intrinsic relation between demand and supply, make sure the coupling degree with each other, as well as put forward the method to improve the coupling degree. The research  plays a significant role in promoting the development of economy and logistics in harmony.

Yamaguchi, Nobuhiko in their paper ?Combining pair wise coupling classifiers using individual logistic regressions?, studied ?Pair wise coupling is a popular multi-class classification approach that prepares binary classifiers separating each pair of classes, and then combines the binary classifiers together. This paper proposes a pair wise coupling combination strategy using individual logistic regressions (ILR-PWC). We show analytically and experimentally that the ILR-PWC approach is more accurate than the individual logistic regressions.? published in Neural Information Proceedings, 2006, p 11-20.

Meeus, Leonardo in their paper ?Market coupling simulator?, studied ?A market-coupling algorithm is implemented in MATLAB based on the principles of location marginal pricing. The algorithm can be run through the WWW. The market coupling simulator is useful to test market-coupling algorithms and to confront students with some of the decisions generating companies take in liberalized electricity markets.? published in 2005 IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting, 2005, p 150-155.

Yang, Hong Yul  in his paper ?Detecting indirect coupling?, studied ?indirect coupling, which is, coupling between entities that are not directly related. What little discussion there is in the literature suggests that any form of indirect coupling is simple the transitive closure of a form of direct coupling. We will demonstrate that this is not the case, that there are forms of indirect coupling that cannot be represented in this way, and suggest ways to measure It.? published in 2005 Australian Software Engineering Conference ASWEC 2005, 2005, p 212-221.



II. ANALYSIS OF THE COUPLING MECHANISM BETWEEN URBAN LOGISTICS AND ECONOMY  A. Coupling & coupling relationship Coupling original as a concept of physical, it means the  influence phenomena was brought by two (more than two) systems or movements interaction effect, for example the two poles of amplifier, signal magnify by Resistive and capacitive coupling or transformer coupling; and Mutual inductance between the two coils through magnetic coupling. Coupling  Research of Coupling Relation between City Logistics and Economy based on Artificial Neural Network Fang Xie,  Shouwen Ji,  Yang Liu,  Xinghua Huang  Beijing Jiaotong University School of traffic and transportation, Beijing, China, 100044 jyj0758@126.com     can be considered as two different things turn to a system by mutual promotion, restraint, and linked, that means every subsystems have dynamic association relationship based on interdependence, mutual coordination and promotion.

Coupling relationship describes a relationship of interaction effects among systems and factors, based on coupling. In this paper, influence which was produced by logistics and economy coupling factor was called coupling.

B. Coupling relationship between city logistics and economy There?s an interaction mechanism between urban logistics  and economy. It is a law that modern logistics industry mutual related and promoted with the local economy, and the existing of the interaction coupling and positive feedback loop is one of the main forms of it. There?re various principal contradictions or different major aspects of the contradiction in every period, which lead to distinct development modes.

The coupling between the urban logistics and economy is based on the certainty or uncertainty of demand and supply.

However the effect may change and then several modes appear. The coupling relation follows the rule of their spiral by a cycle turning way. It also emphasizes the ?limited balance? of the demand and supply, in order to realize the sequential decision of multi-stage and the synergetic process from out of order to in good order.

There are three modes of coupling between urban logistics and economy:  Mode 1: ?logistic chasing? mode As the rapid economic growth in the city, the demand for  logistics grows at the same time, which the local logistics industry can not be met. So the coupling between urban logistics and economy presents in chasing. The condition of software and hardware for the modern logistics industry should be improved. That means the capacity of transportation and storage facility should be enhanced, as well as the logistic management, in the interest of satisfying the economic need.

?Logistic forerunner? mode The economic development is enslaved to the capacity  of transportation facility in those cities where the transportation is underdevelopment or in the harbor cities. A majority of the domestic harbor cities bring in the strategy of ?booming the city by the port?. That?s a reflection of the ?logistic forerunner? mode. The logistic facilities, especially the construction of the transportation facilities become the base of the economic development. Logistics industry has been considered to be cornerstone and the forerunner of the whole city.

Mode 3: ?logistics-economy association? mode When the logistic demand and supply can assort with  each other and can meet the need of the economic growth, the coupling between the urban logistics and economy present itself mostly in the ?logistics-economy association? mode.

The economic growth calls for the development of logistics in capacity and quality. The logistics industry has to apply itself to the promotion of its quality and the optimization to its structure, together with increasing the capacity, which provides the local economy with favorable environment. The modern logistics industry mutual related and promoted with the local economy.

By regulating the modes of coupling between urban logistics and economy, the contradictions between demand and supply can be solved by following the alternant evolvement rule, and the strategic target of the economic development can be finally accomplished.



III. ANALYSIS OF CITY LOGISTICS AND ECONOMY COUPLING RELATIONSHIP BASED ON  SYSTEM DYNAMICS  A. Importance of System Dynamics analysis In System Dynamics, system is made up of cell,  movements of cell and information; it is entia of structure and function. The basic structure is feedback loop; it is a loop of state of system, velocity and information, these elements corresponding to the three components of system: cell, movement and information. According to character of feedback process, it separated into positive feedback and negative feedback. Character of positive feedback is it is able to generate self-reinforcing mechanism, but negative feedback?s is that is able to generate self-inhibition mechanism. Complex system behavior is decided by cross mechanism of positive and negative feedback loop.

With further development of city logistics and economy, logistics plays more and more important role. System dynamics is imported to research of city logistics and economy, the meaning are to analyze and think interaction effect of city logistics and economy by view of system, to examine their relationship on the whole situation and overall perspective, and then to develop potential to improve and make up the shortfall, to coordinated develop city and logistics enterprise.

B. Coupling relationship of city logistics and economy evaluation system based on system dynamics  Decision of subsystem and System indicators factors City logistics and economy coupling relationship  evaluation system was built up to analyze the coupling relationship of city logistics and economy by system dynamics, it concludes two subsystems: subsystem of city logistics supply and subsystem of city economy development, coupling model was based on theoretic of system dynamics, showed figure 2-1     Figure 2-2 COUPLING OF CITY LOGISTICS AND ECONOMY SYSTEM  DYNAMICS MODEL Coupling relationship of city logistics and economy  evaluation system is a complex and dynamic social economy system; it refers to city GDP, industry policy of the country, income of logistics, and management of logistics and so on.

In this paper, figures of causality were drawn to show the coupling relationship between city logistics and economy.

During the development process of city logistics and economy, modern logistics becomes the motive and new profit of city logistics, for example, providing more posts, increasing export and pulling consumer spending etc.

according to theoretic and principle of system dynamics, combined with characters of coupling relationship of city logistics and economy evaluation system, the whole system loop was drawn, showed figure 2-2    City GDP City Total Freight+  City Freight Loading Capacity  +  City of Logistics Outsourcing  +  Total Logistics Investment of Enterprise  +  +  Resources Consumption  +  +  Types of Business Provided by Enterprises  Enterprise Freight Loading Capacity  Enterprises Number of Transportation  Enterprises Logisitcs Income  +  +  +  +  +  City per capita Consumption Expenditure  +  City per capita Income  ++  Transport of waste  Sustainable Utilization of Resources  +  -  -  Enterprise Efficiency Level Improvement  +  +  City Logistics Warehousing Capacity  City Enterprise Storage Capacity  -  -  - City Industrial  Investment-  +  Industry Policy +  City Logisitics Cost  City Logisitics Income  +  -  -  +   FIGURE 2-2 CAUSALITY FIGURE OF CITY LOGISTICS AND CITY ECONMOY  DEVELOPMENT  Subsystem of city economy is made up of various elements which are logistics needed by city economy and development of city, when the main factor changes, other factors change, then it forms a positive feedback loop, showed  figure 2-3  City GDP  City Logisitics Investment  City Total Freight  Enterprise Sales  City of Logistics Outsourcing  Enterprise Produce Capacity  City Industry Investment  City Logisitcs Cost  Commodity Stocks  Resource Consumer  Enterprise Number  Per capita Consumption Expenditure Can Use  Per capita Consumption Income  Can Use  +  +  +  -  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  + +  +  + +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  -  +   FIGURE 2-3CAUSALITY FIGURE OF CITY ECONOMY DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM  DYNMAICS  City economy develop with city logistics supply, positive feedback of subsystem is made up of city logistics total investment, total warehouse capacity, freight capacity and other factors, showed figure 2-4  City Logistics Total Investment  Possession of Transport  +  Freight Loading Capacity  +  Transport of waste  + +  +  Logistics Funds Utilized  City Logisitics Total Income  +  + +  City Logistics Warehousing of  Capacity  Logistics Capital Turnover Rate  Sustainable Utilization of Resources  +  +  +Cargo Turnover Rate  City Transport Mileage  Cargo Transport  ++  + +  - +   FIGURE 2-4CAUSALITY FIGURE OF CITY LOGISTICS SUPPLY SYSTEM  DYNAMICS

IV. NEURAL NETWORK MODELING OF URBAN LOGISTICS AND ECONOMY COUPLING  RELATION EVALUATION To evaluate coupling interacting degree of logistics and  economy in different stage of development, evaluation model of urban logistics and economy coupling relation is built. The model is composed of three parts; they are efficacy function, coupling degree function and BP network prediction model of coupling degree.

A. Selection of sequence parameter Economy and logistics coupling process is a process    from disorderly to orderly of their relationship. In this paper, indicators which token development of logistics and economy are taken to be Parameter system, including city logistics supply Sequence parameter and city economy development Sequence parameter, showed table 4-1  TABLE 4-1 INDEX MARK OF URBAN LOGISTICS AND ECONOMY COUPLING RELATION EVALUATED MODEL  Parameter of order  Index group Index   Urban economic development demand index   Output value of district divisional industry  District total output value; Total value of first industry; Total value of second industry; Total value of third industry; Number of enterprise, Gross industrial output value; Industrial sales output value  Primary energy purchase consumer demand of industrial organization  Total consumption quantity,; Purchase quantity; Storage volume  Social consumer sum Social consumer sum Total storage value of wholesale retail merchandise  Total storage value of wholesale retail merchandise  External economy primary index  Gross import, gross output  Town resident living Per capita disposable income   Urban logistics supply index   Quantity of highway passenger and goods transport  Cargo quantity, velocity of goods circulation  Quantity owned of highway conveyance  automobile quantity of freightage  Highway mileage number Gross mileage Quantity of waterway goods transport  Cargo quantity ? velocity of goods circulation  Quantity owned of waterway conveyance  Powerboat gross; Payload  Investment of Logistics facility  Traffic, storage  B. Efficacy function Order parameter of Urban logistics and economy  coupling relation evaluation model is presumed as ui (i=1?  2??n). The value of ui is Xi (i?1?2,?,n)?ui shows the  value of contribution to system. If ui is 0 1iu? ? . While ui approaches 0, is the most unsatisfied and while ui approaches  1, is the most satisfied. ?i??i ( i i iu? ?? ? )are upper range value and lower range value of order parameter for stable system. The faster economy develops the larger demand for logistics. Logistics which is promoted by economic development and demand-supply link develops uninterruptedly. The degree of demand order parameter u1  and supply parameter u2 in the model to system increase. So u1 and u2 are positive efficacy. The efficacy functions are shown as formula (1),(2).

( )1 1 1 1 1( )u X ? ? ?= ? ?   ?1? ( )2 2 2 2 2( )u X ? ? ?= ? ?  ?2?  Generally speaking, the total value of degree of order of order-parameter ui in system can be calculated by integrated method. Common methods include geometrical mean method and linear weighted sum method. Geometrical mean method is shown as formula (3).

1/( ) ( ) ni iU u u= ?        ?3? In the formula, U?ui? represents complex order of  parameter. U?ui??[0,1], larger U?ui?will be more contribute to system; Smaller per contra.

C.  Coupling function Use the conception of the Capacitive Coupling and its  model in the physics for reference. The coupling function of urban logistics and economy shows  Cn={(U(u1)?U(u2)/[(U(u1)+U(u2)?U(u1))]1/2)}        (4) Obviously, the value of the coupling degree is between  0 and 1. when Cn? 1,the degree of coupling reaches its maximum, systems achieve positive resonance coupling between the internal elements ,then tends to a new ordered structure; when C= 0, the degree of the coupling gets smaller, no relations among systems, neither their inside elements.

The system tends to a development of out-of-order.

D. BP forecast model of coupling value Artificial neural network has many abilities, such as  learning ability, parallel processing capacity, and legend storage capacity. Particularly, the three feed-forward neural network is provided with power of approximation to arbitrary complex nonlinear connection. It shows the dynamic and phased characteristic in the process of the coupling between economy and Logistics, so it is applicable to forecast the situation of the dynamic coupling in the next five years. BP model shows:     FIGURE3-1 BP MODEL  Based on the graph model, the network performance can    be improved, reduced learning time, and speed up convergence to make sure the stability of the algorithm while using momentum algorithm to perform the study ?training of BP model for forecasting algorithm.

V. ANALYSIS OF THE COUPLING RELATIONS BETWEEN CITY LOGISTICS AND ECONOMY  According to the model above, coupling relation of Xuzhou City in Jiangsu Province is going to be analyzed.

Xuzhou city is the transport hub of the eastern part of a typical city with wonderful transportation network, the formed  railways?highway highways and waterways. The main  shipping network has made the city a rising industrial city.

Using data in <Statistical Yearbook of Xuzhou> of 1996?  2005 to complete the original data collection, Set matrix constituted two indicators.

A. Calculation coupling between logistics and economic in Xuzhou city previous year  According to active function, coupling function and actual data in guide line gather. Table4-1 shows the result of comprehensive order parameter and coupling which are calculated by evaluation model of coupling relation between logistics and economy.

Forecast and analysis for development of coupling relation between logistics and economy in Xuzhou  To forecast the coupling relation between city logistics and economy in 5 years, first using multi-linear regression analysis forecast index for 5 years, then calculate values of parameter between city logistics and economy by active function. Before forecast coupling set up BP model like Figure 3-1,then using data in Table 4-1 to train and simulate BP model, in which economic development needs parameter, city logistics supply parameter and coupling for 1998,2001,2004 are used as testing samples, taking part in simulation; the other 7 groups of data are used as training sample, training for BP model.

According to network forecast BP model, two groups of parameter are used as input variables of BP model; use network was trained to simulate coupling values of evaluation model, Table4-2 shows   TABLE 4-2 COUPLING AND PARAMETER FORECAST VALUE OF LOGISTICS AND  ECONOMY INXUZHOUCITY Year 2007 2008 2009 Economic development  needs parameter  0.2933 0.3172 0.4173  City logistics supply  parameter  0.2267 0.2598 0.3596  Coupling degree 0.4968 0.5027 0.5071 Year 2010 2011 Economic development  needs parameter  0.5435 0.7572  City logistics supply  parameter  0.4098 0.4765  Coupling degree 0.5175 0.5206 Analyze data from Table 4-1and Table4-2, value of  coupling between 0.49-0.5, coupling relationship, between logistics and economy is at an intermediate stage, coupling show fluctuation. The fluctuations of coupling show that normal development of logistics and economy is reciprocity.

When economy develop well, the need of logistics is growing, if supplement of logistics doesn?t satisfy the need, coupling fall; if development of logistic keep the balance of need and supplement, coupling rise. Analyze from model, the development model of them is ?logistics chasing?. Data from tables show that development rate of economy is faster than logistics, so hardware and software of logistics should be    improved to be suitable to economic development, and then the balance can be kept.

To improve the coupling of logistics and economy, achieve cooperation between logistics and economy, government should play great role in city logistics and economy; city logistics infrastructure should be promoted vigorously, logistics network should be built up; development of e-commerce should be promoted actively, lever of industry information should be upgraded.



VI.  STRATEGIES OF ENHANCING CITY LOGISTICS AND ECONOMY COUPLING  RELATIONSHIP Logistics and economy supplement each other, the  level of logistics development is determined by the level of economic development, and logistics development can be promoted development of economy with a rapid speed.

Logistics states and logistics activities are closely linked by economic operation environment. In order to promote city logistics and economy coupling relationship, seize the development opportunity of city logistics, enhance the competitive capability of city regional economy; this paper gives some advice as follows:  A. Give full play to city logistics and economy of government. In the development process of city logistics and economy, government promotion is an absolutely necessary element. Having been effected by planned economy so many years, the government?s management functions for logistics are separated by several functional departments. It is difficult to allocate resources effectively in this mode, and the policies are not perfect. The government department should persist the principle of that the logistics unifies the city overall economy development, the government guidance unifies the enterprise independent development, the government should formulate the policy and the laws for logistics, completes the macro-control of city logistics.

B. Construct city logistics network, and establish logistics center in the city economy center. Unite the water transportation, the road, the aviation, the railway together as an intercommunication network, to provide Multi-model Transportation in the operation, promote the integration of logistics further, optimize its industrial structure, satisfy the growth of the logistics need that comes from the fast development of economy ,establish the high level, multi-purpose, strong collection and distribution function socialization logistics center, has the vital role in the city and in the local development, promote the primary industry, the second industry to reduce the cost, enhance the economic efficiency and optimize industrial structure. The quantity and quality of the logistics demand is closely related with the level of economic development.

C. Today development of e-commerce and industrialization logistics should be actively promoted. Technology is very important, and information technology is important to high efficiency logistics. With information technology such as bar coding, EDI technology, automatic sorting technology,  Freight tracking system, GPS and electronic ordering system etc,  make merchandise flow, logistics, information flow and fund flow synchronization under the surroundings of e-commerce. Rationalization and modernization of logistics will low cost of economy, improve the city economy move and quality, also it will promote rapid economic growth further.
