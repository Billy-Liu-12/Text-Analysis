High Efficiency Association Rules Mining Algorithm for Bank   Cost Analysis

Abstract   This paper introduces improving rate and proposes the incremental mining algorithm for optimizing association rules based on CBA mining algorithm.

Comparing with the traditional algorithm, the improved algorithm is fast, efficient in incremental data mining and can find trends in association rules. The decision making reliability is enhanced by the association rules obtained from the improved algorithm. The algorithm was used to bank cost analysis with test results showing that the prediction precision of the algorithm is better than that of the traditional algorithm.

1. Introduction   Technique developing results in accumulation of management data with amazing speed. As the byproduct that comes with innovation of Internet, E-commerce, E- bank, POS and intellectualized machine, electronic data obtaining has been convenient and existed everywhere.

For management decision-making, the date is often stored in data warehouse and data mart. Data mining is the new field with fast development, and it is the crossover application field of many study fields. Data mining is important in decision-making system of enterprise informationalization and every walk of life. Association rules mining in transaction data is one important portion of data mining research.

Although association rules roots in POS, it can be used in many fields. The basic data mining processes of association rules are: first, choose right element, decide different statistic level, choose specific degree, and only with element appearance degree in data is the same. The effect of association rules is the best; second, produce rules, then propose sup. and cof. Given one transaction data set D , association rules mining?s work is to find association rules that is not less than the appointed min- sup and min-cof.

CBA is one traditional mining algorithm using in bank cost analysis. CBA is classification based on association.

This algorithm integrates classification mining algorithm and association rules mining. CBA algorithm produces classifier through two processes. The first process, find classification association rules(CAR). The second process, choose high prior degree rules for cover training  set from the discoverable CAR, that is, if the left of the associations rules are the same and the right of them are different, we choose high-cof. rules as possible rules.

After obtaining association rules that satisfy the min-sup and min-cof. between the conditional attributes and the decision attributes, the importance of the rules is defined as[4]: the importance of rule A is ( )imp A , rule A   and B  is given.

If  ( ) ( )cof A cof B> ,then, ( ) ( )imp A imp B> ; If  ( ) ( )cof A cof B= , sup( ) sup( )A B> ,then,  ( ) ( )imp A imp B> ; If ( ) ( )cof A cof B= , sup( ) sup( )A B= ,rule A  is created before rule B ,then,  ( ) ( )imp A imp B> ;  The algorithm is as follows: ( )R sort R= ;  for each rule r R?  in sequence do tcmp = ? for each case d D?  do  if d   satisfies the conditions of r then store .d id  in tcmp  and mark r  if it correctly classifies d ; if r  is marked then insert r  at the end of C ; delete all the cases with the ids in temp from D ; selecting a default class for the current C ; compute the total number of errors of C ;  end end find the first rule p  in C  with the lowest total number of errors and drop all the rules after p  in C ; add the default class associated with p  to end of C , and return C .

(our classifier) [4].

Traditionally, CBA was used in bank cost analysis.  In part 2 and part 3, we?ll discuss a new mend of the original algorithm.

2. Introduction of the improving-rate factor   The higher the cof. is, the stronger the association rules is, namely, the strong association rule. But sometimes it is wrong. In circumstance of precondition  International Symposium on Electronic Commerce and Security  DOI 10.1109/ISECS.2008.47     and conclusion both with high-sup, although the precondition and conclusion are irrelative, their association cof. is high. One better way to judge the intensity of association rules is to compare the cof. with the standard value of the rule, here we suppose that relative item set?s generant probability created with every rule and generant probability of former item set is independent. We can use frequent item set?s frequency to calculate the standard value. Standard cof. is the concomitantly generant association?s sup divided by the number of transaction in database. And this can help us calculate ?the improving-rate? of the rule. ?The improving-rate? is the cof. of the rule that is divided by the cof. of generant association supposed to be independent. If the rate is bigger than 1, it means that the rule is useful. And the bigger ?the improving rate?? is, the higher the association rule?s intensity is.

This is an example that uses one random-access database. We use the association rules mining importing the improving rate, and the result is showed in the following table.

Improvement of original algorithm by incremental mining algorithm   In Apriori algorithm of original association rules mining, if the database is updated, the rules created by original database mining will be not appropriate. The ecumenical way is to mine the new database again using the algorithm. In the modern data management circumstance that information increases rapidly, it results in much repeated work and over-load of database?s operation. And it wastes original result obtained by old database mining. The ameliorative algorithm pays attention to the trends of rules development when mines database by association rules algorithm. The new algorithm reduces the number of database scan, and improves efficiency of data mining. It has better precision in decision-making support.

We use incremental mining algorithm to mend the original algorithm. For protecting rules, we present a rule protection model with weight. This rule protection model with weight will exert forecast function in the latter work  of incremental mining. Suppose 1W  and 2W  are the weight of D  and d respectively. For association rule X Y? , we define the sup and cof. as the following[5]:  1 1  2 2  ( ) ( ) ( ), ( )  ( ) / ( )  Supp w X Y W Supp X Y W Supp X Y confw X Y  Supp w X Y Supp w X  = + ? =    ? i ? i ?  ?   Here, 1( )Supp X Y?  and 2 ( )Supp X Y?  are the rule?s X Y?  sup. in D  and d  respectively.

( )Suppw X Y?  and ( )confw X Y? are the rule`s X Y? sup. and con. in D d?  respectively.

For association rule X Y? , its sup. and cof. are defined as the following[5]:  1 1  1 1  ( ) ( ) ( ),  ( ) ( ) ( ),  n n  n n  Supp w X Y W Supp X Y W Supp X Y Confw X Y W Conf X Y W Conf X Y  = + +  ? = ? + + ?  ? ? ?   Here, ( )iSupp X Y? and ( )nConf X Y? are rule?s  ( X Y? ) sup. and  cof. in incremental set iD .

First, we use AIUA( advanced incremental updating  algorithm ) to mend  incremental association rules when min-sup isn?t changed. The algorithm need respectively scan only once the original database and the new incremental database.

The algorithm is as the following [6]: Input: DB , the original transaction database  L , the set of DB ?s frequent item set db ,  0S ,the min-sup Output: ''L , the set of DB db? ?s frequent item set (1) ''L ?=  for each X L?  do begin if X , count 0 (| | | |)L S DB db? ? + , then  { }'' ''L L X= + ; { }FL L X= ? ;  Else max max{ sup | }D i iS x pD x L? =  ? end  (2) min 0 max 0( )d DS S t S S? ?= ? ? ? ; for each x db? do begin if x , count 0 (| | | |)db S DB db? ? + then  { }'' ''L L X= + ; { }db db x= ? ;     else '  min{ | , (| | | |)}  i dL x db x count db S DB db  ?= ?  ? ? +  end (3) for each FX L?  do begin for each 'x L? do begin if X , count FL X+ , count  ' 0 (| | | |)L S DB db? ? +  then '' '' { }L L X= + ' ' { }L L X= ?  else  { }F FL L X= ? end end (4) ' ' min 0{ | , }d dL L x S x Supd S?= ? ?  ? (5) if 'dL ?=  then output  ''L else for each 'dx L? ,do begin  max max{ sup | }d i iS x pd x L? =  ? min 0 max 01/ ( )D dS S t S S? ?= ? ? ?  end end  (6) min( , )D k DL aproiri gen L S ?= ? (7) for each 'dx L?  do begin for each DX L?  do begin if X , count DL X+ , count  ' 0 (| | | |)dL S DB db? ? +  then " " { }L L X= +  else delete X end end (8) output "L  And then, we use rule protection model with weight to calculate significative association rule?s sup in the new database after updating. We analyze and forecast significative association rules by finding trends of sup?s change when database is updating every time. And it can improve the reliability of decision-making. On the other aspect, we obtain the strong association rules in original database, which is lost when the database is updating.

Calculate the statistic degree of the lost rules, and we can get more reliable forecast result.

4. The application of improved algorithm in bank cost analysis   In process of bank cost analysis, we analyze the basic product attributes and product cost. Based on it, we get the rule that product?s profit is relative to one or some of the attributes and obtain idiographic association rules. The data mining process of bank cost analysis includes: gathering of data, data pretreatment, model training and model evaluating.

We analyze the six months statistic information of bank product. The former five months? data is the original database. And the sixth months? data is the incremental data. We use the original algorithm and the improved algorithm to mine the bank cost analysis database.

The result shows that the improved algorithm is better than the original CBA algorithm. The precision of cost analysis is improved 30 percent. So, with the improved algorithm, we can efficiently mine association rules and mend incremental data mining in database, then improve precision of decision-making.

5. Conclusion   The paper begins from CBA for mining association rules, and analyzes specialty of CBA. According to practical instance, the paper points out the shortcoming of the original algorithm. We introduce the improving -rate factor to increase the precision for optimizing the original algorithm, and present the improved algorithm for mining incremental data in database. With the data of one bank?s six months statistical information, we test the new algorithm and compare it with the original algorithm.

The result shows that the improved algorithm improves the reliability of data mining, and provides more information for decision-maker.
