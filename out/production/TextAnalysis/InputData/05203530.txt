I.  INTRODUCTION Recently, the constantly improving level of China's  urbanization and the rapidly increasing urban population have brought great burthen to the traffic in city. So many researches about traffic problem are developed widely, especially the researches about vehicles flow have been arrived many achievements. But the researches about Pedestrians flow is few, and these researches focus on Pedestrians flow on walkways and neglect Pedestrians flow on stairways, especially in Transfer Station, the researches is very important to organize traffic flow.

In other countries, some researchers have been studied the characteristics of pedestrians flow, in 1958 Hankin, in 1971 Fruin and in 1988 Ando analyzed the relations between density-velocity and density-flow rate by investigating to commuters on walkways. In 1969, Predtechen Skii&Milinskii studied on the characteristics of pedestrians flow under emergency conditions and normal conditions, and draw curves about density-velocity and density-flow.



II. TYPE STYLE AND FONTS THE QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS ON PEDESTRIANS FLOW ON STAIRWAYS IN  TRANSFORMATIONS STATION This investigates obtain 177 records of down-stairways  pedestrian flow, among them, 123 of the Chifeng road station,22 of people's square station,32 of shanghai train station, the analysis mainly adopts the data of the Chifeng road station. It also obtains 452 observation data records of up-stairways pedestrian flow, among them, 431 of people's square station, and 21 of shanghai train station. According to the validity analysis of the date, we select 344 records among them to carry on the regulation analysis. The following figure shows the relation of the velocity and density in three investigates spot.

Figure 1.  scatterplot about down-stairways velocity ~ density relationship  of Chifeng road, people's square and train stations   Figure 2.    scatterplot about up-stairways velocity ~ density relationship  of Chifeng road, people's squares and train station   DOI 10.1109/ICMTMA.2009.343      Figure 3.  scatterplot about down-stairways flow rate ~ density relationship of Chifeng road, people's square, train stations   Figure 4.    scatterplot about up-stairways flow rate ~ density relationship  of Chifeng road, people's square, train stations  From the Figure 1 we can see, when the density smaller than 0.334 p/m2, most of down-stairway velocity would decrease fleetly along with the density increasing. It says that the affection of the pedestrian velocity to the density is more obviously when observing down-stairways, especially in the initial stage that the density starts enlarge particularly, but when the density is bigger than 0.334 p/m2, the velocity of down-stairways decreasing equably along with the density increasing, but the range is smaller than the level of walkways.

According to the calculation of the flow rate, density and velocity relation, we can get the relation of the flow rate and density, its scatter plot diagram is as follows: along with the increment of the pedestrian flows density, the up-stairways and down-stairways pedestrian flows velocity goes a gradual increment, but when the density increases to some degree, the up-stairways and down-stairways pedestrian flows velocity will appear a trend for descend, this number is the optimum density that the stairs pedestrian go through.

Under this density, the stairs has the biggest flows rate, and the biggest capacity i.e. According to two diagrams of top, the optimum density of the down-stairways pedestrian is 21 /25.2 mm=? , the optimum density of the up- stairways pedestrian is 22 /27.2 mm=? , we can see, the optimum density of the up-stairways and down-stairways is basically consistent, but generally speaking, the optimum density of down-stairways pedestrian is smaller than the up- stairways pedestrian density, it?s mainly because density has more affection to the down-stairways pedestrian velocity.



III. MODELS ON PEDESTRIANS FLOW ON STAIRWAYS  A. The model on density-velocity of pedestrian free flow on stairway According to the service level of pedestrian flow on  stairway, when the density is under 2/5.0 mp  for upstairs  pedestrian flow or 2/4.0 mp  for downstairs pedestrian  flow, the pedestrian flow is free, that is to say, the pedestrian on stairway can walk in the light of their conventional velocity that subject to the motive, the physical condition, their age and so on.

In the following, the chart reflected the relation between the density and velocity of pedestrian free flow on stairway   Figure 5.  Graph of the relationship between velocity and free density  Free density is 4.005.00 ???? ?? or ( ?  stands for density), the velocity of pedestrian flow on stairway is independent of the density.

4.005.00)( ????= ??? downstairsupstairsconstV The function shows that the density ( ? ) can not change the velocity (V ) in some range. But the velocity distribution takes on a certain kind of rule by analyses to the specimens, which may be test by the software of Mat lab, using the command of norm plot(X) in Mat lab, the velocity is normal distribution.

Figure 6.  the normal distribution probability of velocity on free density  The figure of the normal distribution probability can evaluate whether many data come from normal distribution.

If they do, the figure in the normal distribution probability figure is a beeline. According to the figure 6, on stairway,     the velocity of pedestrians under free density possesses normal distribution. And the average value of velocity is sm /82.0 , namely, the velocity of pedestrians on stairway is generally sm /82.0  when pedestrians aren?t affected by other pedestrians.

B. The model on density-velocity of pedestrian jam flow on stairway when density exceeding maximal density When the pedestrians on stairway are too many, this  may bring jam and lead the pedestrians not to walk, so 0=V )( max?? ? . In the following, analyses to the  max? will be stated.

Generally speaking, the horizontal projective area of a  pedestrian is his occupational area in stairway. The value of average occupational area is various in many countries. In Germany, it is 219.0~12.0 m , in Russia, the value is 0.14 2m and 21862.0~1458.0 m in Austria. This area can hold only one pedestrian. When exceeding the value, the stairway will be jam and all pedestrians can?t walk. In china, in term of some researchers? investigation, the area is 216.04.04.0 m=? ,  So, the space occupation rate of pedestrians ( d ) is 216.0 m  2max /2.616.0 11 mpd ===?              (1)  The relation between density and velocity of pedestrian jam flow on stairway )( max?? ? :  2/2.60 mpV ?= ?  (2)  C. The model on density-velocity of pedestrian jam flow on stairway under others conditions According to the traffic flow theory that Green shields  put forward:  ?= j  fVV ? ?1                                 (3)  Analogously, The equation about velocity (V )-density ( ? ) on stairway is:  21 aaV += ?                                 (4) Similarly by simulating with Matlab software, the curve  can be gained, as following:    Figure 7.  the function relation between velocity and density on stairways  The equation about velocity ( V )-density ( ? ) on upstairs pedestrians and downstairs pedestrians  85.0-0.16 += ?upstairsV   86.0-0.14 += ?downstairsV  (5) By analogy, the equation as:  Upstairs: jfV ?/ 0.16                            (6) The velocity under free density: 85.0' =  f V m/s          (7)  Jam density: 2' /4.516.0/86.0 mp j  ==?               (8) In the same way, we can conclude '''jV  and  '' j?  of  downstairs pedestrians: smV  j /86.0''' =  2'' /12.614.0/86.0 mpj ==?         (9)  To upstairs pedestrians: 85.076.0' ?= f  V m/s            (10) 2' /4.585.5 mp  j ?=?                          (11)  To downstairs pedestrians: smV  j /86.093.0''' ?=    2'' /12.682.5 mpj ?=?       (12)  On upstairs and downstairs pedestrians flow, we can find the data is consistent, so the equations can reflect the characteristics of pedestrians flow on stairway.



IV. THE VERIFICATION TO THE MODELS ON PEDESTRIAN FLOW ON STAIRWAY  A. The verification to the models about the relation of flow rate and density on pedestrian flow on stairway In order to verify the veracity of the functions, by using  data fit software, many kinds of functions about ??f include simple equation, quadratic equation, cubic equation, quadric equation and so on will be built, the curves of the equations as followed:  Figure 8.  Figure 8 the curves of equations about the relation of flow rate and density by using dataFit software  TABLE I.    EXPLAINING ABOUT SOME PARAMETERS OF THE EQUATIONS  Rank Model StdError RSS R^2 Ra^2  1 Sixth order polynomial 0.10 1.01 0.84 0.84  2 a*x^5+b*x^4+c*x^3+d*x^2+e*x+f 0.10 1.01 0.90 0.85  3 a*x^4+b*x^3+c*x^2+d*x+e 0.10 1.01 0.95 0.85  4 a*x^3+b*x^2+c*x+d 0.08 1.01 0.93 0.85  5 a*x^2+b*x+c 0.05 1.02 0.96 0.85  6 a*x+b 0.10 1.44 0.96 0.85     Analyzing the figure and the table above, the red curve-- quadratic equation is optimal, so it is reasonable that the thesis uses quadratic equation to reflect the relation between velocity and density of pedestrians flow on stairway.

B. Comparing the pedestrian flow on stairway to the pedestrian flow on walkways about the relation of flow rate and density As above, we analyze the function of ??V  and ??f  on stairway, because of few researches on pedestrians on stairway, the analysis by comparing is impossible, but some researchers such as Fruin and Hankin have researched the pedestrians flow on walkways, so we can compare the pedestrian flow on stairway to the pedestrian flow on walkways about ??V and ??f :    Figure 9.  the curves of ??V  on stairway and on walkways    Figure 10.  the curves of ??f  on stairway and on walkways Hankin in 1958, Fruin in 1971 and Ando in 1988  analyzed the relation between velocity and density, density and flow rate of pedestrians flow on walkways, when the density is small (Hankin: 2/25.00 mp?? ? Fruin: 2/25.00 mp?? ? And: 2/95.00 mp?? ? the velocity changes very little when the density changes, which is identical with the analysis to pedestrians flow on stairway. On stairway, when 2/5.00 mp?? ? , the velocity doesn?t subject to the density and is normal distribution,  because of the different characteristics of stairway and walkways, the free densities of pedestrians flow on stairway and on walkways are different.

Hankin?s curve about ??V  reflected that the velocity will decrease rapidly with the density increasing  if 2/395.0 mp?? ? , if 2/3 mp?? , the velocity will decrease gently with the density increasing. For lacking date, Fruit?s curve was not projected beyond 2/8.1 mp , but  2/8.10 mp?? ? , the relation between the velocity and the density is linear and Ando?s curve is similar with Hankin?s curve. If the density is same, the velocities on walkways all are bigger than on stairway, which is very reasonable. Because on walkways the pedestrians can gain larger walking space than on stairway, the pedestrians subject to the steps on stairway, they can?t enlarge their step. in addition, in 1969 Predtechenskii & Milinskii studied on relations between ??V and ??f  of  on walkways in emergency conditions and normal conditions. In emergency conditions, the velocity exceeded obviously the velocity in normal conditions, if 2/35.00 mp?? ? , the velocity is constant, about sm /6.1 , if 2/5.435.0 mp?? ? , the change range of the velocity increases, if 2/5.4 mp?? , the velocity will decrease rapidly, and when  2/5.5 mp=? , 0=v . In normal conditions, Predtechenskii & Milinskii curve is alike with the curve of this thesis, the value of velocity is approximately identical under the same density.
