Hierarchical Fault Diagnosis and Health Monitoring in Multi-platform Space Systems.

Abstract? Current spacecraft health monitoring and fault diagnosis practices that involve around-the-clock limit- checking and trend analysis on large amount of telemetry data, do not scale well for future multi-platform space mis- sions due to the presence of larger amount of telemetry data and an increasing need to make the long-duration missions cost-effective by limiting the size of the operations team. The need for efficient utilization of telemetry data by employing machine learning and rule-based reasoning has been pointed out in the literature in order to enhance diagnostic perfor- mance and assist the less-experienced personnel in perform- ing monitoring and diagnosis tasks. In this research we de- velop a systematic and transparent fault diagnosis methodol- ogy within a hierarchical fault diagnosis framework for multi- platform space systems. Our proposed Bayesian network- based hierarchical fault diagnosis methodology allows fuzzy rule-based reasoning at different components in the hierar- chy. Due to the unavailability of real formation flight data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methodol- ogy by using synthetic data of a leader-follower formation flight. Our proposed methodology is likely to enhance the level of autonomy in ground support based spacecraft health monitoring and fault diagnosis.
