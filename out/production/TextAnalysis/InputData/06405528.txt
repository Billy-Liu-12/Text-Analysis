Region-based Ranking in Association Analysis for News Relation Discovery

Abstract?Using an association-based technique to find associations among news documents can obtain useful news relations. However, existing works may not detect meaningful relations since only single association measure was used to mine news relations. This paper presents a region-based ranking approach to selectively use different association measures for different ranking regions, towards improvement of the ranking mechanism for news relation discovery. To evaluate region-based ranking, the method is compared to the conventional ranking method, which has no region construction. As performance evaluation, the top- k results of each method are compared using rank-order mismatch (ROM). Compared to the non-region method, the region-based method can find meaningful relations among news with the average ROM improvement of 1.21% ? 28.32% for confidence and 4.83% ? 29.04% for conviction, respectively.

DOI 10.1109/KICSS.2012.34     Fig. 1. News relation discovery framework  2 FRAMEWORK OF NEWS RELATION DISCOVERY  To discover meaningful news relations, we introduce a framework based on association rule mining techniques, as presented in Fig. 1.

There are three main steps, i.e., (1) prepro- cessing, (2) mining process, and (3) verifica- tion process. The remaining terms after prepro- cessing (term segmentation(1.1) and stopword elimination(1.2)) are used as representatives to express the document. In the second step, the documents which are represented by a set of terms, except stopwords, are used for the asso- ciation rule mining process(2). In this process, it is possible to use one of alternative options, which are varied by term representation, term weighting and association measure. As a result, we obtain a set of association rules, specifying the relation strength among documents, such as in the figure {d1 ? d2} and {d1 ? d2, d3}.

In general, among a large number of rules can be generated, only some of them are poten- tial ones. To this end, an additional process, namely verification process(3), can be applied to rank a set of rules based on a subjective or another objective criterion, to filter or rank to obtain more proper association rules. In this verification step, it is possible to use either a ranking method(3.1) or a machine-learning technique(3.2). In this work, we focus on a ranking technique. As more automatic process, machine learning technique can be applied.

This technique is left as our future work.

3 NEWS RELATION TYPES In our task, three main relation types are clas- sified based on the relevance of news events: (1) ?completely related? (CR), (2) ?somehow related? (SH) and (3) ?unrelated? (UR) [2].

A CR relation stands for two news docu- ments when they exactly describe an identi- cal event, usually reported, at the same time period, by two news reporters from different publishers with different headlines or phrases.

A SH relation may exist between two news documents with either one of three follow- ing conditions. As the first condition, namely ?subnews?, two news documents describe the same event but one may have more details than the others. The second condition, called ?series?, represents the situation that two news documents form a series of events reported in different time sequences. For the last condition, named ?similar theme?, news documents hold similar topics or themes.

A UR relation indicates the situation that two news documents are absolutely unrelated in their contents, or even their topics or themes.

4 ASSOCIATION-BASED APPROACH FOR NEWS RELATION DISCOVERY Association rule mining is well-known data mining technique for knowledge discovery, proposed by Agrawal [13]. Recently, associa- tion rule mining or its derivatives have been applied in finding relations among documents [2], [3], [14]. In this work, by encoding news documents as items, and terms in the doc- uments as transactions, mined are a number of frequent patterns, each of which represents a set of documents that share common terms more than a threshold, called support. There- after, as a further step, a set of frequent rules can be found based on these frequent patterns with another threshold, namely confidence. As for encoding terms in the documents, it is typically possible to define terms in the form of single words, compound words, and named entities to use terms as representatives to pro- cess the document.

Unlike traditional association rule mining, mining document relations requires handling non-binary data. Towards this, in [2], [3], [14],     (a) Generalized support (b) Generalized confidence sup(X, Y ) = sup(X ? Y ) = sup(Y ? X)  =  ?n j=1  mink+li=1w(zi,tj)?n j=1  maxmi=1w(ii,tj)  conf(X ?

X)  = conf(X?Y ) sup(Y )  =  ?n j=1  mink+l i=1  w(zi,tj)?n j=1  mink i=1  w(xi,tj)?n j=1  minl i=1  w(yi,tj)?n j=1  maxm i=1  w(ii,tj)  Fig. 2. Definitions of generalized association measures: (a) generalized support, (b) generalized confidence, (c) generalized conviction, and (d) generalized lift.

the conventional support, confidence, convic- tion, and lift were generalized to cope with weighted items and then used as association measures. A formulation of the association rule mining task on news document relation dis- covery can be summarized as follows. Assume that I = {i1, i2, ..., im} is a set of m news documents (items), T={t1, t2, ..., tn} is a set of n terms (transactions), a news itemset X={x1, x2, ..., xk} ? I is a set of k news documents, and a news itemset Y ={y1, y2, ..., yl} ? I is a set of l news documents. The generalized support, confidence, conviction, and lift of X ? Y (sup(X ? Y ), conf(X ? Y ), conv(X ? Y ), and lift(X ? Y )) are shown in Fig. 2, where w(ii, tj) represents a weight of a term tj in a news documents ii and Z = X ? Y = {z1, z2, ..., zk+l} ? I , composed of k news documents in the X and l news documents in the Y . By this method, the discovered relations are in the form of X ? Y . The relation X ? Y with a high association value implies that the news documents in X has a relationship with the news documents in Y .

5 NON-DIRECTIONALIZATION AND REGION-BASED RANKING In the past, although the previous works [2], [3] have been explored for a suitable factor setting that can discover high-quality relations, they still have some limitations, especially ones related to the definition of association measures as follows. First, they had a strict condition on the definition of association measures where  the min() function was applied to aggregate the association measures of X ? Y and that of Y ? X into a non-directional measure. Second, they assumed a single association measure for relation quality measurement.

In this section, we describe two extensions towards improvement of the rule ranking mechanism, i.e., (1) non-direction measure and (2) region-based ranking.

5.1 Non-directionalization The first extension is to replace a strict condi- tion of the min() function with a more general weighting function. To this end, the weighted non-directional association measures for confi- dence and conviction, denoted by confN and convN , are formulated below.

confN(X, Y, ?) = ? confNmin(X, Y ) +  (1? ?)confNmax(X, Y ) (1) convN(X, Y, ?) = ? convNmin(X, Y ) +  (1? ?)convNmax(X, Y ) (2) where ? provides a weight to balance between the minimum and maximum values of the association measures, defined by confNmin(X,Y ) = min{conf(X ? Y ), conf(Y ? X)}, confNmax(X,Y ) = max{conf(X ? Y ), conf(Y ? X)}, convNmin(X,Y ) = min{conv(X ? Y ), conv(Y ? X)}, and convNmax(X,Y ) = max{conv(X ? Y ), conv(Y ? X)}.

When ? is set to 1, confN(X, Y, ?) becomes confNmin(X, Y ) and convN(X, Y, ?) is replaced by convNmin(X, Y ). This simple condition is the one used in [2] and [3]. As an extreme case, when     X and Y are identical, confN(X, Y, ?) will be 1 whereas convN(X, Y, ?) becomes an infinity value. The min() function seems suitable to find strong relations, especially almost identical cases, where the values of confN(X, Y, ?) and convN(X, Y, ?) are very high. However, it can- not handle well when a small value is obtained.

Especially for cases of subsumption where Y is subsumed by X or vice versa, the min() function may return a small value, when X (or Y ) is much larger, and then cannot express this relation. In contrast, the zero value of ? makes confN(X, Y, ?) and convN(X, Y, ?) cor- respond to confNmax(X, Y ) and convNmax(X, Y ), respectively. For this case, a large value is obtained when X subsumes Y or vice versa.

However, even we get the max value of either 1 (in cases of confidence) or infinity value (in cases of conviction), we cannot conclude either X and Y are identical or one of them are just subsumed by the other.

To grasp this characteristics, this paper pro- poses an adaptive mechanism, a so-called region-based ranking method, to utilize a re- gion information by setting different suitable ??s for different situations. That is, in this work, the value of ? can be varied. It is effective to use ? = 1 when the minimum value of confidence or conviction (confNmin(X, Y ) or convNmin(X, Y )) is high to recognize a strong relationship while a smaller ? should be set for the opposite cases (moderate relationship). Details of the proposed method will then be explained.

5.2 Region-based Ranking Approach  As for the second extension, to release such a strict measure, a method to strengthen the rule ranking mechanism, a so-called region- based ranking is proposed. In this method, first, the range of relation strength is prelim- inarily partitioned into a number of regions.

Second, different weights (0 ? ? ? 1) can be assigned to represent relation strength of a rule in each region in order to optimize ranking performance in that region. As the ranking process, two main issues are how to determine the suitable points of weight change to form regions and which weight we should assign to each region.

For the first issue, one popular measure is F-measure [15] defined as 2PR  P+R . By plotting F-  measure with respect to rank positions, we can find the condition with the maximum per- formance. The F-measure is used to find the rank position and its corresponding association measure which obtains the highest value. Such positions can be considered as the boundaries, virtually representing (1) the boundary of CR vs. SH, and (2) that of SH vs. UR, constructing three regions; CR, SH and UR. At this point, for each range of relation strength, it is possible to determine a suitable weighting value for it.

For the second issue of the assigned weight for each region, it is possible to explore each possible weighing candidate one by one to find the most suitable one. As the next step, the ranking process scores relations in each re- gion, with different objective functions, where different weights (?) are set for these three regions. To implement this, the ??s of the three regions are explored with a step of 0.1 in the range of 0.0 to 1.0, in order to find the optimal weighting among the weighted non-directional confidence and conviction.

6 EVALUATION METHODOLOGY 6.1 Evaluation Dataset  Currently there is no standard dataset of news relations in Thai, available as a benchmark for the purpose of performance assessment. Due to this circumstance, we have constructed an evaluation dataset of 811 Thai news documents collected from three news online sources dur- ing August 14-31, 2007, consisting of politics, economics, and crime categories.

As our evaluation collection, a set of 1,132 news relations (this work, for simplicity, uses a pair of news documents.) are distinctly selected from each top-k relation sets of twenty four conditions where their association values are high. The list of them can be found in Column 1 of Table 1.

For each of 1,132 relations, three assessors read and judged whether the two news doc- uments are related with each other by one of the predefined relation types. The final decision was done by voting. Finally, the types of news     relations were determined, consisting of 65 CR- type, 571 SH-type and 496 UR-type relations.

6.2 Evaluation Criterion  Our evaluation method applied a pairwise comparison technique [16]. Eq. (3) indicates the so-called rank-order mismatch (ROM), the value of which ranges between 0 and 100.

ROM(A,B) = 2?M(A,B) N(N ? 1) ? 100 (3)  M(A,B) = N?  i=1  N?  j=i+1  |?(rA(i), rA(j))  ??(rB(i), rB(j))|, (4)  where ?(a, b) = 1 if a < b, otherwise, 0.

Here, the ROM value is calculated by di-  viding a mismatch score (M(A,B)) with the mismatch score of the worst case (N(N?1)). In Eq. (4), M(A,B), the mismatch score, indicates the number of rank mismatches between two ranked lists, say A and B, given a set of N objects to be ranked. The mismatch score ex- presses how much the ranked list A does not match with the ranked list B. The rA(k) and rB(k) are the respective ranks of the k-th objects based on the ranked lists A and B, respectively.

|?(rA(i), rA(j))??(rB(i), rB(j))| gets 0 when the object i and the object j preserve the rank order in both the ranked list A and the ranked list B.

Otherwise, it becomes 1.

7 EXPERIMENTS  7.1 Experimental Settings  We have conducted three experiments to ex- amine performance of the proposed methods.

The performance is evaluated at different k?s of the top-k ranks in a ranked list generated from each individual method, using the rank- order mismatch compared to human judgment, denoted by ROMh. For the best case, all news relations are ranked by the system in the same order with the human judgment, obtaining ROMh of 0. On the contrary, the value of ROMh is 100 when arranging in the completely re- verse order.

Different term weights trig- ger different association values (i.e., relation strength) for each mined relation. Even there have been plentiful of possible settings for these factors, this work focuses on unigram (UG) and bigram (BG) as term representa- tion basis, binary term frequency weighting (BF), term frequency weighting (TF), and their modification with inverse document frequency weighting (BFIDF, TFIDF) as term weighting, and confidence (CONF), conviction (CONV), and lift (LIFT) as association measure.

The first experiment explores the detailed performance of possible combinations of these three factors, i.e., twenty four settings. Explo- ration of these combinations is made empiri- cally to find the best setting towards discovery of high-quality news relations. Table 1 shows the ROM values of twenty four methods in each top-k rank. For the top-50 mined rela- tions, the combination of bigram, term fre- quency with inverse document frequency, and confidence (BG-TFIDF-CONF), as well as bi- gram, term frequency with inverse document frequency, and conviction (BG-TFIDF-CONV),     appears to be the most effective since it has the lowest ROM values of 0.41%. Compared to the methods with confidence or conviction, the methods with lift are not good at the upper ranks (< top-500) but perform well in the lower ranks (> top-500). For instance, the method with unigram, term frequency with inverse document frequency, and lift (UG-TFIDF-LIFT) performs the best on the top-1100 rankings by giving the lowest ROM values of 9.63%.

These results indicate that bigram with either confidence or conviction is effective in the upper ranks while unigram with lift has a good performance in the lower rank, and term frequency with inverse document frequency is the most effective term weighting for both cases. These optimal combinations, i.e., (1) BG- TFIDF-CONF, (2) BG-TFIDF-CONV, and (3) UG-TFIDF-LIFT, are used in the subsequent experiments in order to show how the pro- posed region-based approach can help improve quality of news relation discovery.

7.2.2 Uniform Weighting This experiment investigates the performance of ranking on all relation types, i.e., CR vs. SH vs. UR, with uniform weighting and no re- gion construction. This experiment helps clari- fying the ranking performance when only one weighting is applied for ranking and then indi- cates the necessity of region construction. The experimental results will be used as a baseline for the next experiment on the region-based approach.

The graph in Fig. 3 shows the results, with the legend of the weight (?), association mea- sure, and an average ROM calculated from the whole range, respectively. The average ROM is calculated by the integral of ROM over the whole range divided by the total number of ranks (1132). Based on the graph, the following observations can be made.

Firstly, the confNmin as well as convNmin (? = 1.0) achieves the lowest ROM for the upper ranks (? 175), i.e., 0.00% ? 5.45% for confidence and 0.00% ? 5.49% for conviction, while the confN (? = 0.5) and convN (? = 0.5) gains the lowest ROM for almost the lower ranks (> 175), i.e., 3.71% ? 9.92% for confidence and 3.82% ? 9.91% for conviction.

Fig. 3. Ranking performance (in % ROM) for uniform weighting on all relation types.

Secondly, some other measures, i.e., confNmax (? = 0.0), convNmax (? = 0.0), and lift are also a good weighting for the lower ranks (? 800), i.e., 9.09% ? 9.74% for confidence, 8.86% ? 9.53% for conviction, and 9.32% ? 10.58% for lift. Nevertheless, for whole range, lift obtains lower performance than confNmax and convNmax.

Thirdly, considering the whole range, there is a lot of ranking errors (a high ROM) at the higher (between 50 and 175) and lower ranks (> 500) but the number decreases at the middle ranks (between 175 and 500).

Fourthly, although the confN (? = 0.5) and convN (? = 0.5) are the best weighting for the whole range with the lowest average ROM (6.65% for confidence and 6.79% for convic- tion), they seem not good for the higher ranks (? 175), while the confNmin as well as convNmin (? = 1.0) is the worst weighting for the whole range with the highest average ROM (9.17% for confidence and 9.10% for conviction) they perform very well for the higher ranks (? 175).

All observed characteristics give us a poten- tial to separate ranks into several regions and then use different weightings for each region.

7.2.3 Region-based Ranking The last experiment investigates the ranking performance when different weights are as- signed to different regions. The performance of ranking is investigated for all relation types with varied weightings and region classifica- tion. According to the results of the previous experiment, it is high potential that the confNmin     TABLE 2 confNmin and confNmax of three datasets at the highest F-measure of top-k and bottom-m  relations.

Dataset No. confNmin conf N max  1 37.47 17.15 2 39.27 12.08 3 39.27 15.28  Average 37.86 14.84  Fig. 4. Ranking performance (in % ROM) when the left and right boundaries are automatically set to 42 and 406.

and convNmin (? = 1.0) is suitable for the upper ranks while the confNmax and convNmax (? = 0.0) is proper for the lower ranks. To maximize the performance of ranking, we have applied different weightings for different regions. Com- posed of three steps, first we have ranked the list of relations based on confNmin (or convNmin) as well as confNmax (or convNmax). Second, we select the top-k relations ranked by confNmin (or convNmin) and choose the bottom-m relations ranked by confNmax (or convNmax). Third, the re- maining relations (at the middle) which do not exist in top-k relations and bottom-m relations are further ranked by another suitable criterion.

In this experiment, the weighting of the middle region is investigated in the range of 0.0 and 1.0. To simplify the graph, we display only the cases of 0.0, 0.5 and 1.0. The classification of regions is done by either automatic or manual settings.

As for the automatic setting, the region is identified by observing the ranks where F- measure achieves the highest value for the top- k and the bottom-m relations. To determine the  TABLE 3 Ranking performance when the left and the right boundaries are manually varied with a  step of 50, and fixed to 50 and 400, respectively  Average ROM (%) Criterion Varied Left Boundary Varied Right Boundary  50 100 150 200 300 350 400 450 confN (1, 0, 0) 6.93 7.03 7.12 7.24 6.85 6.91 6.93 6.93 confN (1, 0.5, 0) 6.59 6.79 6.97 7.12 6.68 6.67 6.57 7.10 confN (1, 1, 0) 7.28 7.28 7.28 7.28 7.22 7.29 7.21 9.07 convN (1, 0, 0) 6.83 6.90 7.00 7.14 6.64 6.69 6.81 6.81 convN (1, 0.5, 0) 6.50 6.71 6.90 7.05 6.54 6.50 6.48 6.80 convN (1, 1, 0) 7.21 7.28 7.21 7.21 7.16 7.16 7.18 8.65  boundary fairly, we have performed boundary selection by three different datasets which are randomly selected by 50% of each of relation types. With the average values in Table 2, the first region is positioned at confNmin = 37.86 and the last region is located at confNmax = 14.84.

The remaining range is defined as the middle region. By matching the value at the boundary to the corresponding rank position, the first, second, and last regions are partitioned into 1-42 ranks, 43-406 ranks, and 407-1132 ranks, respectively.

Figure 4 shows ranking performance where three regions are highlighted with two vertical lines. In the legend, the weights for the first, the second, and the last region are shown as the three numbers in a parenthesis, followed by the average ROM over the whole range.

Here, the numbers of CR-, SH- and UR-type relations are indicated for each region. Com- pared to the uniform weighting (non-region), the region classification gives us a potential to adjust weights due to the lower ROM. The figure evidences that the optimal ? values for the first, the second, and the last region are 1.0, 0.5 and 0.0, respectively. This optimal weight- ing combination makes us obtain the lowest average ROM, i.e., 6.57% for confidence and 6.46% for conviction.

In the manual setting, we vary the left boundary between 50 and 200 with a step of 50 but we fix the right boundary at 400, which is the best location when we apply the F-measure.

According to the results in Table 3, it is possible to conclude that placing the boundary more on the left makes us obtain better performance.

In conclusion, the lowest average ROM can be     obtained compared to other setting, i.e., 6.59% for confidence and 6.50% for conviction when the left boundary is 50 and the weight is (1, 0.5, 0). Then we vary the right boundary between 300 and 450 with a step of 50 when the left boundary is fixed to 50, which is the best left boundary beforehand. The results indicate that ranking performance is good when the right boundary is less than 400. That is, the best performances (the lowest average ROM) are 6.57% for confidence and 6.48% for conviction when the right boundary is 400 and the weight is (1, 0.5, 0).

As conclusions, the result of manual bound- ary setting implies that the left boundary should be set to 50 while the right boundary should be placed around 400. Furthermore, the boundaries assigned by the manual setting are close to ones obtained from the automatic setting. This result implies that our automatic boundary setting, region-based weighting ap- proach, can provide suitable regions for setting different weights in ranking mechanism.

8 CONCLUSIONS This paper proposed a region-based ranking method to improve discovering news relations.

The proposed method achieved the best per- formance by setting the weighting of the first, the second and the third region to 1, 0.5, and 0, respectively, with the average ROM of 6.57% and 6.46% for confidence and conviction, consecutively. By comparing to the non-region method when the weights are set to 0, 0.5, and 1, the experimental results showed that, for the whole range, the proposed method im- proves the performance with the average ROM improvement of 11.87%, 1.21% and 28.32% for confidence, and 11.91%, 4.83% and 29.04% for conviction, respectively.

As future works, to provide more practical similarity, the possibility of applying latent se- mantic indexing or some disambiguation meth- ods will be examined. It is possible to apply a machine-learning approach to find the optimal parameter setting in ranking mechanism.
