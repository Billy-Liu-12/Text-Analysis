Abstract?THEMIS, a constellation of five spacecraft, referred to as probes, was launched in 2007 to study the physical processes leading to the aurora. In 2009, THEMIS successfully completed its primary mission phase. As an ambitious mission extension, the constellation was then split into two new missions ? THEMIS-Low and ARTEMIS. THEMIS-Low refers to three of the five probes that continued magneto- spheric observations in Earth orbits while the remaining two probes started a new lunar mission called ARTEMIS. The two ARTEMIS probes were transferred from Earth to lunar orbits via low-energy trajectories with Earth and lunar gravity assists. The complex mission design and navigation operations took the two probes on trajectories along weak stability boundary manifolds, venturing out as far as 1,500,000 km and 1,200,000 km from Earth, respectively. Upon arrival in the lunar environment, both probes were first inserted into libration point orbits where they spent up to ten months collecting science data. Periodic stationkeeping maneuvers were executed to ensure the two probes would not be ejected from these unstable orbits. In 2011, both probes were successfully inserted into stable, retrograde and prograde lunar orbits, respectively. We report on the challenges with executing the complex navigation plans, discuss experiences and lessons learned from operating two spacecraft in lunar libration point orbits for the first time ever, and finally cover mission planning and science operations in the lunar environment.
