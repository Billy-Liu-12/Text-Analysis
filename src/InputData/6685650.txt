Abstract  We have been in the realm of Big Data for more than a decade, and have seen a large number of common and valuable application types. These are increasingly supported by widely available tools, both commercial and open source, so that the advantages of Big Data are starting to become accessible to a much wider audience.  At the same time, new sources of data and types of applications are ready to dominate the Big Data arena. Many of these are concerned with data generated by devices, rather than individuals, and require applications that are real time, or even predictive. The toolsets are also evolving to satisfy the needs of these applications.

In this talk, we look at where we are going.

xxvi    Topic: Big Data Requires a New Platform for a New Era of Analytics: The Way to Win with Data, Apps and Analytics.

Abstract  Modern Internet greats leverage the consumer-grade enterprise to generate immense new business value.

Startups churn out new, market-changing products and services. Even individuals around the world use it to create extraordinary impact.  The consumer-grade enterprise is a convergence of new technologies, and it has enabled the rapid development of a new class of applications, data-driven and context intelligent. They are quickly changing everything about how we live and work. But established companies have been largely left out.

Achieving this capability alongside entrenched technologies and existing data platforms has been stunningly difficult. Big Data fabrics enable Enterprises to become consumer grade and for the first time, the employees of the enterprise have the capabilities necessary to rapidly create consumer-grade applications. To create powerful experiences that serve a consumer in the context of who they are, where they are, and what they are doing in the moment. To store, manage and deliver value from fast, massive data sets. To build, deploy and scale at an unprecedented pace. Learn how Big Data platforms enable the integration of these sophisticated new data fabrics with modern programming frameworks and cloud independence.

He also led government and industry projects in the areas of grid and pervasive computing.

Before joining QinetiQ, Mark worked in academia, where he combined cluster computing methods with quantum mechanics to predict the properties of semiconductor microstructures. Mark holds a Masters in Computing and a PhD in Physics from Newcastle University.

Topic: Data Integrity, Privacy and Trust Issues in Hadoop  Abstract:  Hadoop excels as a scalable compute and storage platform. However, it falls short with respect to security and compliance. How do you keep track of sensitive data, and how can you manage its lifecycle? How do you find out who?s accessed it? And how can you protect it from being tampered with? These questions become financially and reputationally significant when the data stored includes sensitive data, for example credit cardholder details and other personally identifiable information.  In this talk we critically examine Hadoop in the light of key regulatory requirements. We identify gaps in Hadoop?s current security model, and discuss the features and technologies needed to support secure and compliant Hadoop applications moving forwards.

xxviii    Topic: Next Generation Intelligent Phone: Hope or Hype?

Abstract  With the development of the Mobile Internet, smart phone is becoming more and more popular. Will the future phone become smarter close enough to Human intelligence or beyond the human?s ability? That will be the biggest challenge in the future. At first, we have been getting more and more data and more semantic data in mobile area than before and other areas, giving us the chance to well understand in deep and use the data properly. Secondly, new approaches enable us to discover the data in the Cloud computing and distributed computing. Finally, there will be more and more devices connected by mobile as bridge that will provide the fundamental foundation for intelligence. We are addressing the above research challenges in attempt to develop a new phone called intelligence phone (NGIPHONE), and we hope that it will be new trends in next 10 years. In this talk, the smart phone intelligence will be addressed from three aspects: (i) Human factor in machine learning, (ii) Mobile intelligence, and (iii) Future research challenges and directions.

Dr. Xie was  Topic: Learning Social Kernel Communities and Behaviors from Big Social Media  Abstract  In the past decade, we have seen the increasingly flourishing of social median such as Twitter, Facebook, Google+, and MySpace. The social networks have all grown up to the top sites globally in terms of the global network traffic. The big data of social media imposes many challenges for us to (i) track the communities, (ii) learn the social interactions of interests, and (iii) predict the social behaviors if necessary. Current approaches are very limited to provide reliable and valid understanding of the meanings that are otherwise never discovered from the data sets we collected. In this talk, we will further explore the technical challenges, review the existing approaches, and particularly present an insight on the  xxix    semantic understanding of the social media such that the time and geographic properties of the social interactions are precisely revealed.
