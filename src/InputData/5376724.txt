The Application of Improved 3D_Apriori Three-dimensional Association  Rules Algorithm in Reservoir Data Mining

Abstract?Logging curve data plays a key role in oil and gas exploration and development owning to the ability to provide plentiful data and large amount of useful information, so the logging curves interpretation methods are also of importance. With the rapid increase of log data, our human is out of the ability to understand such numerous and complicated data, therefore conflict between the increasing data and the limited comprehend capability occurs. The thesis attempts to introduce association rules into logging data interpretation and provides a novel method.

The classical Apriori algorithm is improved in the paper that named 3D_Apriori to interpret the logging attribute data and enhance efficiency of mining association rules behind the logging data transformation and the inherent information.

Logging data acquired from Jingbian gas field of CNPC is used to verify the algorithm. Two strong spatial association rules are resulted from the computation.

Applying these rules to interpret the test logging data, 78.6% coincidence validate the methodology.

I. INTRODUCTION During the oil and gas exploration and  development process, we may get numerous and complicated geological data, such as: logging curve data, seismic data and geological materials. Actually the reservoir data is three-dimensional data, so the three-dimensional spatial data mining methods show a good application prospects.

The research purpose is mainly to describe the reservoir characteristics through the mining spatial association rules. Objective is to study the reservoir based on association rules data mining algorithm, in accordance with the semantic description of reservoir characteristics applying the extracted mining spatial association rules.



II. THREE-DIMENSIONAL SPACE OF THE ASSOCIATION RULES ALGORITHM  Apiori algorithm is initially proposed by Rakesh Agrawal and Ramakrishnan Skrikant in 1993, and it becomes the most classic association rules algorithm afterwards[1]. The algorithm uses a sequence of search-level approaches to complete the frequent item sets mining process in cycles. The cycle uses the K item sets to generate K+1 item sets. First, it identifies the frequent 1 item sets, and records it as L1; then L1 is used to generate L2, named the frequent 2 item sets; computation continues until no more frequent K item sets can be found.

The three-dimensional association rules algorithm is based on the classic Apriori algorithm. There are mainly two phases: in the first stage, attribute data discretion and spatial predicate extraction; in the second phase, calculate all of the rules that is greater than the minimum support threshold, which is based on the candidate item set and support degree association rules Apriori algorithm[2][3][4][5][6].

A. The Expansion of Three-dimensional Space Relationship In this thesis only the spatial point object is  involved for the convenience of study. So each  geological layer in the well is regarded as a point  object in spatial space.

A cone-shaped four-direction model is proposed on  the basis of two-dimensional plan space, as shown in  Figure 1.

DOI 10.1109/CIS.2009.95      Fig. 1 Cone-shaped four-direction model  In the above model, the plane?s orientation will be  divided into four plane direction, which code begins  from the due north. ?1? represents the due north  direction, ?2? is east direction, ?3? as due south, ?4?  delegates due west, while ?0 ? means the same location  in the space.

When direction encoding is expanded to the  three-dimensional space, there is a separation of the  space that above the flat part and below. Area above  the plane in which the due north spatial direction is  encoded ?11?, due east ?21?, due south ?31?, and due  west is encoded ?41?; Area that below the  corresponding two-dimensional flat part due north  encoding direction is encoded ?10?, due east ?20?, due  south ?30? and due west is encoded ?40?.

When two point objects share the same plane  coordinate with different elevation value, we define  another four spatial relationships, as shown in Figure  2: adjacent and below reference object codes ?101?;  separated and below reference object codes ?102?;  adjacent and above reference object codes ?103?;  separated and above reference object codes ?104?.

Fig. 2 Layer relationships in same well  Spatial objects are encoded and stored in the  database for the sake of convenient computation. As  Figure 3 below shows, there are four different colored  objects as shown in the spatial space, thus the spatial  relationship matrix likes Figure 4, encoding presents  as: blue, green, magenta, red, ?102?, ?3?, ?31?, ?2?,  ?21?, ?1?.

Improved Apriori Algorithm The improved Arpiori algorithm is divided into two  steps: in the first stage, calculation without considering the three-dimensional distance in association rules; in the second stage, the association rules mining based on support degree in certain  space scope [7][8].

A  B  A  B  B  A  B  A  101 102 103 104  N  E   S  W      At first, spatial association rules is calculated between two spatial point objects with just one predicate without considering the spatial distance, the spatial point objects should have the same number of non-spatial attribute data, and then the iterative starts, non-frequent item sets are removed, association rule with three spatial objects and three spatial relationships is generated. Such computation continues until we get the maximal frequent k item sets based on frequent k item sets. Pseudo-code is listed as follows: input: spatial point database, space predicates database  output: association rules that contains certain spatial predicate 1)  begin 2)   Scan the spatial database, calculate all the  frequent   item sets with two objects and one spatial orientation predicate, named F2;  3)    k = 2; 4)    while (L k ? ?) 5)      k = k + 1;  / / generate candidate item sets 6)      C k+1 = Apriori_Gen (F k, M); 7)      if (C k+1 ? ?) 8)       Continue scanning spatial database,  calculate Ck+1 support rate, if it is greater than minimum support rate, then put it in F k+1;  9)      end if 10)   end while 11)   result = ?F k; 12)  end   Secondly, the spatial space is discreted into a series  of small spaces from minimum to the maximum scope breadth based on the above results. Spatial association rule is mined in a certain space breadth. For example, a 50km scope breadth can be break into five spaces, that is 10km, 20km, 30km, 40km, 50km series of small space. Improved Algorithm pseudo-code shown as follow: input: spatial database, association rules generated.

output: association rules in a certain breadth of space.

1)  begin 2)    for (k = 2; k <N; k + +) 3)     Scan spatial database, calculate the space  scope for each association rules with large support degree.

4)    end for 5)  end

III. 3D_APRIORI DATA MINING EXPERIMENTS AND RESULT ANALYSIS  A. Target Areas and Data Preparations Logging data is collected from the Jingbian gas  field of CNPC, the distribution of the drilling wells as  shown in Figure 5.

Fig. 5 Drilling well Distribution of the study area  A pre-treatment is taken at the beginning: Remove  the redundant geological layers in same well, for they  may cause confusion in following mining calculation  steps; Discrete the continuous data into equal intervals  which is needed for the association rules computation,  trisection method is adopted, each part is coded ?1?,  ?2?, ?3??  B. Results and Analysis  Table I below shows the frequent k item sets  results after association rule mining calculation.

TABLE I FREQUENT K ITEM SETS RESULTS  Term number Frequent K item sets number 1 10 2 14  3 28 4 38  5 32  6 13  TABLE II Frequent k item sets results continued  Term number Frequent K item sets number 7 2     8 1  Based on the Table I, we find the cross-linkages  between the logging attribute data and the cross  interpretation results, there is only one special frequent  8 item sets with support 62.2%, with target layer true  value. Other seven data term is listed in Table II.

TABLE IIII FREQUENT 8 ITEM SETS MEET THE MINIMUM THRESHOLD  Data term Value range Natural gamma 7.5-81.666  Deep Resistivity 13-675.333  Rinse with resistivity 11-374  Hydrocarbon saturation 5-223.666  Deep-water resistivity 0.03-1.353  Neutron 0.5-30.33  Matrix permeability 0-413.666  Cross explain results  gas  Table II above shows that there are only seven  closely associated parameters of the total 20  parameters supporting the target layer. In other words,  the target layer may be possible recognized through  these seven close parameters. According to results, two  association rules are generated:  Association Rule 1: ("target level") ? (natural  gamma (7.5-81.666) ? deep resistivity (13- 675.333) ?  washed with resistivity (11-374) ? hydrocarbon  saturation (5-223.666) ? deep-water resistivity  (0.03-1.353) ? neutron (0.5-30.33) ? matrix  permeability (0-413.666), with confidence 86.5%.

Association Rule 2: (natural gamma (7.5- 81.666)  ? deep resistivity (13-675.333) ? washed with  resistivity (11-374) ? hydrocarbon saturation  (5-223.666) ? deep water resistivity (0.03 - 1.353) ?  neutron (0.5-30.33) ? matrix permeability (0-413.666)  ? ("target level"), with confidence 79.0%.

Because the confidence level is close to or greater  than 80%, the two association rules above can be  regarded as strong association rules.

After obtain these rules, experiment logging data  acquired from Jingbian gas field of CNPC is used to  verify these two strong association rules, with a 78.6%  correct rate as a result. When these association rules  are applied to interpret ?ma514? geological layer in  target study area, we get final excavation results, as  shown in Figure 6. The closing polygon area on the  map is regarded as gas traps, and reservoir of the target  area is correctly described.

IV. CONCLUSIONS  Through the improved Apriori association rules  data mining algorithm practical application for  interpretation of logging data, we are convinced of the  following points:     1) Results show that only a few important logging  data parameters is closely associated with the target  layer in spite of numerous total parameters number, in  order to simplify the calculation, a preliminary  selection of the such parameters can be conducted;  2) Different data discrete method for mining  association rules shows a significant impact on the  final results, use of cluster method for discrete on the  properties may be better;  3) Time complexity of the three-dimensional space  data mining algorithm is mainly caused by the space  predicates. For this reason, the direction of  three-dimensional space qualitative and quantitative  reasoning research seems very significant.
