Abstract?the paper puts forward a new classification method of association rules that is based on support-significant structure.

Starting from the characteristics of customer segmentation, this method introduces a up-to-date rule evaluation index-- significance during the produce process of classification rules, therefore, the evaluation and selection of principle have serious statistical basis. After simple comparison of the real example, we prove the comparative superiority of introducing significance into the customer segmentation.

I.  INTRODUCTION Although the mining association rules based on support-  confidence system has been generally accepted and widely applied, as a empirical method, it lacks rigorous theoretical basis, the corresponding parameter settings also lack the objective criteria and statistical validation [1]. In addition, customer segmentation data has big difference compared to the method commonly used in areas such as medicine and engineering data [2]. In medical and engineering problems, no matter how deep the rules hide, how difficult the knowledge express,  there is an inherent causal link between attributes and classes, they can show certain regularity, but the customer behavior in customer relationship management always only present a statistical law [3-4]. Therefore, the thesis proposed the association rules classified method which is based on strict statistical significance; it is more suitable for application to the customer segmentation.



II. SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATION RULES In statistics, T test is a classical significance test method.

This simple and effective statistical methods can also be used to rate the significance of different tests.

Setting S with n samples, which have kn  objects with attributes K, therefore, the frequency of attributes K appearing  in the samples is n nP k=  . When we need to compare whether there are significant differences between the ratio and a given ratio ? , we can use the following formula (1) calculated values.

p  pt ? ? )( ?=  (1)  np )1( ??? ?=  is the standard deviation.

T distribution tends to normal distribution, that is  ?? u?)w(t , ?u  is threshold of significant level ?  under the normal distribution.

We can introduce the T test method into association rules, and establish mining association rules based on the significance test.

Set BA ?  is a mining association rules obtained from data set D? P ? B ?represents that tuple contains B item set  shared in the D? )( A BP  indicates the ratio of tuple that is not  only contains item sets A, but also B item sets. in the range of D.

Definition 1 says BASig ?  is a significant degree from A to B, or the significant degree of B obtained from A  is P BA  BPA Bp  Sig ?  )()( ? =?  , which  A p n  BpBp ))(1)(( ?=?   If SigMinSig BA _>? , then we call rule BA ? significantly meets the minimum conditions.

?uSigMin =_  is the least significant degree, ?u  is the critical value U, when the significance level is ?  under the normal distribution, there are two significance level of 0.5 and 0.1 which are in common use, the corresponding critical values are 1.96 and 2.74, that is, when the significant level is 1.96, the corresponding  significant level of mining association rules is 0.5.

Definition 2 When a rule meet of support conditions and significant degree condition, we call it significant mining association rules.

Beijing University of Technology Start-up funding for doctor's research (X0025001200801)     In the mining association rules based on support-significant degree, the rules are all significant mining association rules, that means only when a mining association rules is a significant rule, it will be returned to the policy makers as the result, or adds to rule base.



III.  THE MINING ASSOCIATION RULES BASED ON SUPPORT- SIGNIFICANT STRUCTURE  The thesis proposes a classification rules associated with generation algorithm based on support - significant degree structure, improved from support-confidence algorithm basis (CASA algorithm).

The improved method is that the classification association rule mining process uses support - significant degree of evaluation, replaces the current degree of support - confidence index. Due to the significant degree of indicators have clear statistical significance, so that the decision index of the generated rules becomes objective.

Definition 3 Association rule as YX ?  is called classified association rules, which X is the condition of item  sets, Yy ? is the class label, (X, Y) is the rules item set.

Definition 4 For a classified association rule YX ? , the  appear frequency in database of conditional item set X is conditional support count, when a conditional support count of item set is greater than or equal to the minimum support count, the condition is known as frequent conditional item; the number of occurrences for rules set ( X, Y) in the database are known as the rule support count, when a rule item set support count is greater than or equal to the minimum support count, it is called frequent item sets; when the number of occurrences of a classified label in the database is greater than or equal to the minimum support count, such class labels are called frequent class.

Definition 5 When a classified item sets of frequent rules item sets meets the minimum significant degree conditions, it is called the rule of significant classified association.

In the following part, we will propose the classified mining association rules, the assumptions of the database D is a relational thing that contains the relevant data sheet. The database contains N cases and L attributes, these N cases are divided into Q known classes. In the same time, we assume that these attributes are attributes of discrete value, through discreting, we can get corresponding discrete value with continuous values, the discretization of continuous attributes can map continuous value of the property value into the corresponding discrete, and we can use width discrete method, deep discrete method, entropy method and other methods to discrete continuous attributes.

CASA algorithm scans the data several rounds?  and generates all the frequent rules item sets.

The goal of proposed mining association rules algorithm is mining significant rules, the specific algorithm process is divided into the following steps:  (1) find all frequent item sets: the appearance frequency of the item set is at least the same as the minimum support count.

(2) the classified association rules generated by frequent item sets: these rules must satisfy the minimum support and the minimum significant degree.

In the calculation process, firstly, calculate all frequent sets in the data set, identify candidate classes according to frequent sets, for each target class, scan the database, and propose support conditions test. Doing significance degree condition test, if the rule meet the support.degree. The rule which both meet significant degree and support conditions rules regard as significant class association rules and put into the knowledge base.

In the following part, we will give classified association rules in the framework of support-significant degree, that is, the algorithm of significant association classification rules.

The main course of the algorithm from line 1 to line 6 scans the data for the first round, and produces 1 item of significant classified association rules set. Firstly, it generates frequent cluster (line 2), and then the frequent classes set generates frequent rule set (line 3), after that, call the sub-process SignRule_Gen (F), frequent rule set generates significant classified association rule set (line 5), Finally, line 6 is an optional process, it executes to pruning rules (line 18 in the main process is the same), the pruning methods refer to relevant literature [4]. Algorithm 7 to 19 carry out scanning database in the follow-up rounds, and produce all of the significant classified association rules. In the K round of the  scanning process, firstly, the algorithm will produces candidate  frequent rules set CK from frequent rule set 1?kF generated in k-1 round scanning (line 8), this step must use classical apriori principle; then scan the database, get support count of each candidate rules in rules set CK  (9 to 15 lines), and generate k  items of  frequent rule set kF  (Line 16); then call K items of SCAR sets from SignRule_Gen (F) (line 17); finally, select  process pruneRules ( kF ?to pruning sSCAR set.

The main feature processes of this algorithm is that the sub-  process SignRule_Gen generates significant classified association rules set functions from the frequent rules set. Line 3 calculates significant degree of the frequent rules set i , if the degree is larger than that the least significant degree, the rule will be added to the significant classified association set SignRules (line 4), and finally it will generate a significant classified association rules Set SignRules and return to the main program (line 6).

Sub-processes Candidate_Gen executes the kC  function to generate the candidate itemsets K from frequent (k-1) item  sets 1?kF . Among them, ][nim represents the nth item in item set mi . Firstly, the algorithm connects the same item sets of the previous (k-2) items in 1?kF for pairwise, and generates preliminary k item set c (1 to 4 lines); then uses the generated  (k-1) frequent item sets 1?kF  to compare all the (k-1) subset of items? if the preliminary k set of c contains (k-1) items of non-frequent subset, c will be removed (5 to 6 lines);  otherwise, c will be added to the candidate k item sets kC  (line 7). Finally, all the k candidates item sets kC  will get back to the main process (line 9).



IV. CASES COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENT CLASSIFIED EFFECT IN ASSOCIATION RULES  The following specific examples will compare the actual effect based on support - confidence degree and the improved support-significant degree.

Example    A hospital record the relationship of certain occupational disease X and work type A, the minimum support degree min_sup = 2%, minimum confidence degree min_conf = 20%, the data are showed in table 1.

Table 1.  Customer data in a hospital  Suffering from disease X  not suffering from the disease X  Total  Work type A 52 636 688 other types of work 11 1800 1811  Total 63 2436 2499      Rules:  )"X"d(Disease)""W( romdiseasesufferingfworktypeAjob ? According to the data in Table 1, we can calculate the support degree of this rule is 2.08%, it is greater than the minimum of support degree, while the 7.56% confidence level is less than the minimum confidence. Because the rule does not meet the minimum confidence level, the rule in this framework will not be returned to the policy makers as a strong rule. However, we have noticed that the ratio of workers with job type A suffering from disease X is 3 times than the average prevalence rate of this disease, this difference has reached a statistically significant level. Therefore, this rule which is ignored is a useful practical rule, but it is not found out in the above- mentioned mining algorithm.

However, if we use the association rule generation algorithm which based on support-significant degree to re- calculate, we can obtain the following results.

Suppose the minimum support and candidate rules are the same to the above-mentioned algorithm, the significant level set at 1%, according to the above mining algorithms, we can get: the 2.08% support degree is greater than the minimum support degree, while the 16.06 confidence degrees was greater than the minimum significant level. Therefore, the rules is significant, the candidate rules will be added to the collection as a significant rule.



V. CONCLUSION Based on the shortage of support - confidence framework  mining association rules, this thesis proposes a new mining association rule method, which is based on support - significant degree structure of mining association rules framework. The data mining method puts forward a new rule evaluation index - --significant index. In the process of mining rules, it substitutes confidence indicators. The major improvements of the approach is that we use T test with the significance of the confidence index from the statistics instead of the original index based on confidence indicators rules, therefore, the determine indicators of the rules have objective standard.

Based on actual test data analysis, this method has good practical effect in customer segmentation.
