The Dissemination Model of Digital Music in Big Data Era

Abstract?Music industry is one of the traditional industries that is deeply influenced by the new computing strategy for big data. This paper aims to discuss a new solution for the digital music dissemination in big data era. By analyzing the features of big data, the key points of digital music dissemination and the participants in this industry, we put forward a dissemina- tion model for digital music and explain the running details of this model.

I.  INTRODUCTION The coming of the big data era has been challenging and  changing the whole human society greatly, which is bringing us a new reformation in all aspects of our life. The mass communication, which is quite sensitive to new technology, is one of the pioneering fields influenced by this reformation.

Music is not only a kind of artwork, but also an article of consumption that is widely spread and consumed by all kinds of people, thus the dissemination of this special goods is in enormous demand. As a culture product, the carriers of mu- sic have been keeping changing in different historical stages, and nowadays it is majorly transmitted in digital forms alt- hough the other forms may still remain. In fact, digital music is not a new gadget, it has been existing for several decades.

Even so, in the big data and cloud-computing era, the dis- semination of digital music still needs new model.



II. THE FEATURES OF BIG DATA Big data firstly means that the amount of data is ex-  tremely large, as McKinsey Global Institute defines in May 2011: ?Big data refers to data sets whose size is beyond the ability of typical database software tools to capture, store, manage and analyze? [1]. However, this is not everything.

More exactly, it means to collect different variables as many as possible to describe the features of people, things, events and phenomena from all aspects. With the constantly in- creasing demands of recording these variables, the data cap- tured keep growing rapidly correspondently, so consequently the size of database becomes larger and larger and eventually reaches an astronomical scale.

Tremendous data call for new technology and model for their storage, computing and transmission, and also bring us numerous new unexpected applications. The essential fea- tures of big data may be concluded as follows:  A. Enormous and Digitized All the data are in digital form. Although there do exist a  great deal of analog data, and we are now keeping capturing these data from varied sources every second, they are not appreciate because they are not computer-readable. They must be digitized primarily.

In big data era, any data captured are valuable. They are the authentic existence which just reflects the natural features of the world we are in. They are increasing continuously all the time. According to the Moore?s Law of information, the total amount of data is doubling every two years [2].

B. Stored in the Cloud Cloud storage means to store our data not only in the us-  er?s computer but also in virtualized pools of storage through network technique [3]. It provides high efficient service for enormous data storage. To store data in the cloud has many advantages:  ? It may provide almost limitless space for data storing at lower cost.

? It provides immediate access to resources.

? Licensed users can easily share the data.

? By cloud-computing, the data mining can run more  efficiently and find more applications.

C. Computing on Population In traditional statistics, the observation and computing  are often based on samples instead of population when the population is too large. Now in big data era things have changed: we analyze all the data at hand about a topic rather than just a small portion of it to find out the relations be- tween things [4].

D. Intellegent Applications Data can speak. Especially when the total amount of data  grows big enough, much more recessive features of things may be revealed from behind the data, and more correlations between things may be found out. We can find that the truth we got from big data is amazing and quite different from what in the small sample statistics era. These findings are creating various intelligent applications.



III. THE DATAFICATION OF DIGITAL MUSIC From 1990?s, people began to record and transmit music  works in digital forms [5]. Up till now hundreds and thou- sands of digital music works are widely distributed in many corners of the Internet, most of them are just digitized audio files without necessary feature tags, so they are only frag- mentary resources. This brings great difficulties to the utili- zation of these resources. Furthermore, some of these re-  This work is Sponsored by the Research Foundation for Humanities and Social Science of MOE, P.R.C.(Grant No. 09YJC740060)   DOI 10.1109/CSA.2013.195     sources may even be illegal due to the protection of copy- rights.

Therefore, in big data era, mere digitization is far from the demand for disseminating music works efficiently. They need more modification for easy management and computing, they need to be datafied.

Digitization does not means datafication. Just as Viktor Mayer-Sch?nberger & Kenneth Niel Cukier defines in [4]: ?To datafy a phenomenon is to put it in a quantified format so it can be tabulated and analyzed. This is very different from digitization, the process of converting analog infor- mation into the zeros and ones of binary code so computers can handle it.?  The ontological way is quite available for datafying mu- sic data. In our previous work, we have already constructed a domain ontology of music. In this ontology we define eight sub-ontologies to describe the upper concept structure: musi- cal activity, musical work, musical participant, musical activ- ity location, musical skills and arts, musicological theory, music equipment and digital music technique. In these sub- ontologies, by defining the classes, the features of classes, the relations between classes and instances, we build a com- plete system to describe all the features of music [6].



IV. CLOUD STORAGE OF  DIGITAL MUSIC As a new online personal application, the music clouds  provided by some data service providers are available now.

They provide the facility and service that allows users to build their personal music libraries, to sync their music be- tween devices and to stream their music to desktop computer, laptops, tablets, smartphones and other digital players. Here are some famous ones [7][8]:  ? Amazon Cloud Drive: It is a music store and stream- ing service. Users can buy digital music from the Amazon store, as well as upload their own ones, and stream them to desktop or mobile devices.

? Google Music: It is a cloud-based digital entertain- ment hub that lets users upload their entire library to the web and stream it back. It can also stream to any desktop web browser and Android devices.

? iCloud: It is also a combination of music store and music storage. It?s mainly for the Apple devices, as Mac iTunes, iPhone, iPad and iPod.

Furthermore, some other music clod such as MP3tunes, Subsonic, MusicPlayer.fm, Grooveshark, Rdio and Spotify are also very popular.

These music clouds are likely to be private clouds, which mainly face to personal users. Although Amazon Cloud Drive and iCloud can also provide digital music trade service, they are not public cloud yet, because the sharing of re- sources is just between different devices and platforms of the same owners instead of between different users, and the trades of music products are just in the B2C mode.

This is not enough for the efficient dissemination of digi- tal music. We need a more open platform and mechanism that allow all the participants on the dissemination chain share their works, products and services legally with the guarantee of copyright protection.



V. PARTICIPANTS  ON THE DISSEMINATION CHAIN OF DIGITAL MUSIC  Here the participants refer to all the individuals or organ- izations who take part in the dissemination of digital music.

They compose a dissemination chain as follow:                 Figure 1.  Participants on Digital Music Dissemination Chain.

A. Music Producer Music producers are the original creators of music con-  tent, what we can listen finally depends on what they have made for us.

? Composer: the writer of music. A composer com- poses tunes and melodies.

? Librettist:  writer of lyrics. They write lyrics for vo- cal music works such operas and songs.

? Performer: including instrumental music player, song singer and conductor. When they work together they make a band.

B. Music Content Processor As an art of sound, performed music can only be enjoyed  on the scene. If they need to be disseminated across time and space, they must be firstly recorded and processed. So we need music content processors.

? Recording Studio: It is the place where the music performances are recorded by audio (sometimes also with video). Generally speaking they are not public presentations without real audiences. In recording studio the music and voice are often modified and beautified with acoustic technologies.

? Performing Agency: They organize performance and also record the audio and video on the scene.

? Data Processor: They are in charge of the processing of original analog music data, to digitize and datafy them. Even though most of the sound recording equipment can record music in digital form directly nowadays, the datafication is still necessary.

Digital Music Content Provider Music producers can sell their works by themselves, and  they can also authorize them to a third party to distribute their works. Digital music content providers own special dissemination channel or marketing network, they are often closely related with network operators or cloud service pro- viders. They provide online digital music trade platforms.

They play important roles in digital music dissemination.

D. Cloud Service Provider They provide both public and private cloud service for  digital music, including storage, searching, uploading, sharing and even trading. In fact, some cloud service provid- ers are also content providers at the same time, as Amazon.

E. Digital Music Consumer Music may be consumed by different consumers with  different ways.

? Personal Consumer: They are main and direct con-  sumers of music. They buy music works for different using, they enjoy the art of music by listening to them, and they use them as ringtone and ringback music of their telephones. They also buy music ser- vice from recreation business such as Karaok TV, ballroom, odium or music bar.

? Public Media: Media are another main consumers of music, such as television and radio. They use music in their programs everyday, so they have to buy the copyrights of these music works.

? Recreation Business: Some recreation businesses such as Karaok TVs, ballrooms sell music as their service, some others such as restaurants, caf?s, and bookstores play background music, so they also buy the copyrights of the music.

F. Network Operator Network is the fundamental physical facilities for digital  music dissemination because all the digital music works stored in cloud must be transmitted through it. Network op- erator provides network-connecting service for all the partic- ipants on the chain.

G. Hardware Producer Being preloaded in some devices such as MP3 players,  mobile phones, TV sets or even car audio systems, digital music can also be sold together with these devices. So these hardware producers also involve in the dissemination of digi- tal music directly.



VI. THE DISSEMINATION  MODEL OF  DIGITAL MUSIC As illustrated in Figure 2, the dissemination of digital  music is composed of three layers: the producing layer, the storage layer and the transaction services layer.

A.   The Producing Layer It describes the producing process of digital music works  from the original creation to the final datafication.

? Creation: The composer, librettist and the performer  are the primary creators of music. The performance  of the player, singer and conductor is based on the composer and the librettist?s composition. Originally the performance is in the form of sounds, which are audio signals. They can be enjoyed on the scene but only on the scene. If we want to disseminate them asynchronously or synchronously, we need to record or live broadcast them in the form of analog or digi- tal signals.

? Live Shot and Recording: In the recording studio, the performance is recorded in either analog or digi- tal forms, generally with a post-production. General- ly, at the live show, the performance is recorded when being broadcasted at the same time.

? Datafication: If originally recorded in analog form, the performance of music need to be digitized firstly.

After that, the music need to be further datafied by adding tags to them and connecting them to the mu- sic ontology. The final data after all these processing are the digital music content to be disseminated.

B.   The Storage Layer Digital music works are basically stored in the cloud for  a more convenient and efficient dissemination. When pre- pared by datafying at the first layer, the digital music con- tents are transmitted and stored in various clouds.

? Private Cloud: Any organizations or individuals can own their private music cloud for storing, playing online, sharing and treading their digital music works. Some cloud service providers offer private cloud storage service, for free or for a fee. Some companies also build their own cloud-computing fa- cilities by themselves.

? Public Cloud: They are designed for the aggregation and transaction of digital music content, generally owned and run by cloud service providers, digital music content providers or even network operators.

? Hybrid Cloud: Digital music resources are located in different clouds, both public and private. It brings difficulties to the retrieval of and the access to these resources for the terminal users. Hybrid cloud is a good solution that combines both private and public cloud together. Users may obtain any resources they want from different cloud via a unified interface.

C. The Transaction Services Layer This is the user service layer on which the transaction of  digital music occurs. It can be an e-commerce platform that allows a mixed e-commerce model: B2C, C2C, B2B and O2O, anyway, under the guarantee of copyright protection.

? Providers: Not only the digital music content provid- er, but the music producer and the music content processor can all be the providers. The music content provider is a professional content and service pro- vider, who collects sporadic digital music form dif- ferent resources, makes them well arranged and of- fers them to the consumers in various ways, paid or for free. The music producer and the music content processor can sell their resources to the music con- tent provider or directly to the terminal consumers.

Figure 2.  The Dissemination Model of Digital Music  ? Consumers: They buy digital music content or cloud storage service for their personal music library online through a unified interface. For recreation business consumers, they also buy the licensing rights to reuse digital music as a service to their cus- tomers in their places of business.

? Unified Data Interface: All users? data are trans- ferred over a single unified interface among all the participants. It provides a standard platform to access data in multiple e-commerce models of digital music.

An intelligent information recommending system is one of the basic functions, which can push the most useful information to the users and kick out useless ones by intelligent filtering algorithms and user's profile. The advantages of big data computing sup- port the intelligence of the system.



VII. CONCLUSION As a kind of special information commodity, digital mu-  sic is widely consumed nowadays. Different from the other physical commodities and virtual commodities, digital music is one in between. The producing process of music is physi- cal, while the final production and its dissemination can be thoroughly in digital form. An appropriate dissemination model is significant for the whole industry, so it needs a spe-  cial precise study. The model we present here is just an out- line, more details such the technical solutions, the operation strategies and the industrial chain are being further studied in our future studies.
