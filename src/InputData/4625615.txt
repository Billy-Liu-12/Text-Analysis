Mining Drug Targets based on Microarray Experiments

Abstract   Life science industry has been flourished with the  explosion of online Bioinformatics databases and  tools, which can affect the drug discovery process and  development. The integration of unstructured data,  available in biomedical literature (i.e. PubMED), and  structured data, existing in biological databases, by  applying both text and data mining techniques is a  very critical issue in order to identify selected  desirable genes or drug targets. The current work  describes a system, Drug Target Integrative Miner  (DruTiMine), which aims at providing a service to  enhance and shorten the process of drug target  discovery for pharmaceutical companies and research  labs concerned with drug discovery. The system  applies both the capabilities of text mining and data  mining techniques for drug target discovery through  integration of multiple biomedical resources, related  to a specific disease, and mining the association  among them. Furthermore, an association rule mining  algorithm, multi-basket miner, has been developed in  order to discover associations of categories having  multiple values.

Keywords  text mining, association rule mining, drug discovery  process, chemoinformatics, drug discovery informati-  cs.

1. Introduction   Previously, research and development (R&D) for  drug discovery process was divided into: chemoinf-  ormatics and bioinformatics. However, future pharm-  aceuticals are moving ahead towards integrating both  chemoinformatics and bioinformatics into one entity,  called drug discovery informatics in order to serve  healthcare applications. One of the main issues in such  integration is how to analyze integrated data from both  unstructured data, existing in PubMed [1] and  structured data existing in public databases such as  KEGG [2]. There is a need for systems that help in  better understanding diseases at the molecular level by  studying underlying interactions and identifying key  molecular players that seem to be involved in disease  development. Accordingly, certain molecules would  be proposed as drug targets either for gene therapies or  conventional chemical drug therapies, which will  provide a great value to biologists.

Drug discovery is a very critical issue in the  pharmaceutical industry that has six main phases: drug  target discovery, target validation, assay development,  screening, lead optimization, and development. In  order to speedup the first phase of the drug discovery  process, which is the drug target discovery, we have  developed DruTiMine (Drug Target Integrative  Miner).  It is a system that aims at enhancing and  shortening the process of drug target discovery for  pharmaceutical companies and research labs concer-  ned with drug discovery. It is a semi-automated  system for drug target discovery through integration of  multiple biomedical resources related to a specific  disease, such as genes, proteins and chemical  compounds, in a novel mining process. The paper is  organized as follows: section 2 illustrates related work  to our proposed system, section 3 describes the system  in details, section 4 outlines DruTiMine Case Studies  & Usage scenario, discussion of results is shown in  section 5, and finally section 6 gives the conclusions  and future work.

2. Related Work   A few number of related works exists, such as  MEDTAKMI (Medical Text Analysis and Knowledge  Mining), developed at IBM Tokyo research center [3]  for performing text mining tasks on medical  documents.  Several groups in IBM research divisions   chimingchen Text Box      worldwide have developed BioTeKS (Biological  Knowledge Services) [4].  It is a text mining system  that can be integrated with search engines. It provides  extensive text search capabilities and has hierarchical  category, chronological, two-dimensional, and trend  analysis viewers. BioTeKS analyzes biomedical text  and other medical records, where terms and names are  automatically identified. Various software products  have been released into the market that helps in the  drug discovery process. For example, SAS Scientific  Discovery Solutions and Enterprise Miner for  Discovery Process [5] is a mining product for  analyzing large amounts of genes and proteins, having  a mining infrastructure. DiscoveryLink [6] is another  software product, which encompasses data  management solution for Drug Discovery.

3. System description   Given a Microarray (MA) experiment related to a  specific disease selected by the user, where  overexpressed and underexpressed genes of interest  are identified, DruTiMine can determine drug targets  constituting of bioentities (genes and proteins) and  biochemicals together with related information and  mine the associations among them. The process starts  by assembling disease-related DNA Microarray data  from multiple gene expression databases. Analysis of  multiple Microarray data follows resulting in a filtered  list of genes. Biomedical texts relevant to this gene  list, disease and tissue type are collected and text  mining is utilized to extract expert driven knowledge  about such genes, its relationships with other genes,  proteins and biochemicals. This knowledge is then  integrated with several heterogeneous genomic and  biochemical databases to build an integrated data layer  for performing integrative data mining.

3.1. Architecture   DruTiMine architecture is outlined in (Figure1).

The system main components are: document retrieval  using multiple microarray experiments, text mining,  and data mining.   Document retrieval component is  responsible for retrieving related documents, given          multiple microarray experiments for a specific disease  and tissue type. Text mining component mainly  discovers and annotates related proteins in the  retrieved documents. Finally, data mining component  generates association rules describing the relationships  among data integrated from analyzed text describing  proteins, and data existing in public databases,  illustrating protein characteristics such as Gene  Ontology, chemical reactions, and chemical  compounds having biological interests to proteins    3.2. Process   DruTiMine follows the following process:  Figure 1: DruTiMine Architecture         3.2.1. MA experiment retrieval. One of the most  challenging tasks is how to download and integrate  Microarray experiments from multiple resources.

Several online Microarray databases exist, such as  Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) [7, 8],  ArrayExpress [9, 10] and Stanford Microarray  Database (SMD) [11]. However, the current  implementation only supports GEO making use of its  web services (E-utilities), since it is a MIAME-  compliant [12] repository. Furthermore, GEO has  various kinds of data, allowing the user to submit,  search, and retrieve microarray experiments for  different platforms. The data include microarray-based  experiments measuring the abundance of mRNA,  genomic DNA and protein molecules, as well as non-  array-based technologies, such as Serial Analysis of  Gene Expression (SAGE) and mass spectrometry  proteomic technology. Our main focus is on gene  expression data, using Affymetrix platform.

MA experiment retrieval starts by a user query,  specifying the disease and tissue type, the software  connects to GEO and retrieves the experiments that  match search criteria. The user then chooses which  experiments to download locally. Data files, stored in  SOFT (Simple Omnibus Format in Text) format, are  parsed in order to enable batch deposit of multiple  platforms, samples, and/or Series data in one file or  directory.

3.2.2 MA standardization through GEO-MAGE  Modeler. This phase consists of three main parts: 1) SOFT-OM [13] package is used to parse GEO SOFT  files and convert them into an intermediate object  model based on GEO?s schema, 2) PackageModellers  [13] converts the intermediate SOFT-OM to its  respective MAGE-OM [13], and 3) MAGEOM [13]  hosts the main class for this component:  GEOmodeller. This class reads in from the  SearchResults of MA data retriever component, calls  classes of SOFT-OM and then calls classes of  packageModellers. The MAGE object is saved into  two parts: the Experiment MAGE-object and the  Array MAGE object. The experiment MAGE-object  contains the following MAGE packages: Array,  BioMaterial, BioAssay, QuantitationType, BioAs-  sayData, and Experiment Packages. Array MAGE  object contains the following MAGE packages:  Description, Bios-equence, DesignElement, and  ArrayDesign packages.

3.2.3. MA analysis. Identifying which genes are  differentially expressed in a microarray experiment  will lead to significant results, such as which genes are  affected under specific treatment, or finding marker  genes that are determined under a specific case. Both  clustering [14, 15] and statistical analysis have been  performed to achieve this goal.   The most commonly  used statistical test for finding differentially expressed  genes is the classical t-test and ANOVA. In this work,  the two-sample t-test [16, 17] has been performed in  order to distinguish differentially expressed genes in  cases of diseased versus undiseased experiments,  where the formula used is as in equation (1):  t = (xi,1 ? xi,2) / si,                             (1) Where xi,1 is the mean value of gene i in group 1, xi,2  is the mean in group 2, and si is the (non-pooled)  within- groups standard error (SE) for gene i.

3.2.4. Document retrieval. Given a user-specified  disease for a specific tissue, the main objective is to  retrieve documents related to such a disease for further  text mining. Microarray experiments help to discover  which genes are differentially expressed. Once we  have the list of the differentially expressed genes in  MA experiments, that are related to a specific disease  and tissue type, the gene names (and their synonyms)  are used as ?keywords? to search for the related  documents in Medline abstract database.

3.2.5. Document text mining.  The retrieved abstracts  are then annotated with a dictionary based text analytic  engine (annotator). We use a ?Protein dictionary?, a  ?Disease dictionary?, a ?Drug dictionary? and a  ?Chemical Compound? dictionary. The annotated  protein names are collected and additional related data  are fetched from SwissProt and KEGG public  databases. Whereas, the annotated chemical  compounds, diseases and drugs are saved in files that  may help biologists in understanding, interpreting  or  clarifying some ambiguous issues that may arise  during the process. The system computes the number  of abstracts, in the collection of retrieved abstracts,  where each protein name appears together with the  disease name and tissue type. A user defined threshold  for the minimum number of abstracts, where the  protein was cited (together with the disease name and  tissue type), is used in order to reinforce the  confidence in the association between a selected  protein and a specified disease. Therefore, only protein  names that appeared (with the disease name and tissue  type) in at least a minimum number (above a  threshold) of abstracts, will be further processed in  DruTiMine.

3.2.6. Data retrieval from public databases and  integration. Data mined from biomedical literature do  not constitute enough resources for discovering and  proposing identified drug targets for specific diseases.

Public databases provide a huge resource of biological  and chemical information as well. They provide  information focusing on specific domains, such as  protein databases (i.e., Swissprot, PDB [18], and DIP  [19]), Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  (KEGG). In addition, they have major characteristics,  such as heterogeneity, varied interface, and query  capabilities.

Data retrieval in DruTiMine takes a list of protein  names identified during text mining as related to a  specific disease and tissue type, retrieves the  associated data from public databases and store the  values in a DruTiMine database. The design of this  component supports two public databases for proteins  and generelated data, which are Swissprot and KEGG.

The current implementation uses Swissprot protein  database to get the following protein attributes: protein  functions, motif, 3D structure, domain, Gene Name,  Gene Ontologies (Gene molecular functions, Gene  biological processes, and Gene cellular components).

For each Gene ID appearing with protein names,  chemical reactions and chemical compounds are  retrieved from KEGG database.

3.2.7. Association Rule Mining. In DruTiMine,  datasets that are the result of identifying a list of  protein names related to a disease and their associated  data, are multi-valued and usually has a small number  of records.  First, the multi-valued data problem is  defined as a category that can have multi-values. For  example, a protein may have one or more functions,  such as 1433Y_Human protein can have functions by  binding to a large number of partners, usually by  recognition of a phosphoserine or phosphothreonine  motif. Second, when mining is performed, specific  algorithms are required to handle a relatively small  number of records. To deal with these characteristics,  we propose a multi-basket miner methodology.

3.2.8. Multi-basket Miner. Multi-basket miner  method is developed in order to handle multi-valued  datasets with small number of records in Dru-TiMine.

Most of the published work on association rule mining  has used the traditional horizontal transactional for-  mat. However, several approaches have proposed the  vertical transactional format [20, 21, 22].  In a vertical  database each item is associated with its corresponding  tid set, the set of all transactions (or tids), where it  appears. Vertical representation has shown its  effectiveness due to the fact that frequent patterns can  be counted via tid set intersections, instead of using  complex internal data structures. In [23], YAFIMA  used leap-traversal, showing that leap traversal is more  efficient for obtaining frequent patterns than the  previous mentioned approaches. Leap traversal obtain  patterns of different sizes, where frequent sub-patterns  can be found.  In the current system, a new association  rule mining method is proposed, named multi-basket  miner, to handle a variety of data representation,  utilizing a vertical representation for the data and a  leap traversal approach.  Multi-basket miner considers  each item as a basket by itself  Problem Definition:  Let I = {I1, I2 ... Im} be a set of literals called  items, and a transaction database PTD, where each  transaction T is a set of items such that T ? I.  A unique identifier TID is given to each transaction. A  transaction T is said to contain X, a set of items in I, if  X ? T. An association rule is said to be of the form X => Y, X ?  I, Y ? I, and X ? Y = ?.  In the current case, each item by itself contains a set of other  items.  For example, I1 = {i1, i2? ir}, where r is the number of items in I1 basket. A pattern A is frequent if  A?s support is no less than a predefined minimum  support threshold, ?.

Multi-basket Miner Method:  Input: Transactional protein database, PTD, and a  minimum support threshold ?.

Output:  Association rules.

Method steps  1. Scan transaction database once, PTD.

2. F-list=frequent 1-items in various baskets.

3. Let L=?, where L is the frequent pattern  base we can get in PTD.

4. Let S=?, where S is the sub patterns gene-  rated.

5. Let Frequent=?, where Frequent contains  the list of frequent patterns.

6. While (F-list is not empty) do  6.1. L=Obtained (frequent pattern base occurring as an intersection of vertical presentation for items occurring in various baskets)  6.2. If L do not exist in Frequent then 6.2.1. Frequent = Frequent ? L  6.2.2. S = Generate sub patterns from L which their support >= ?  6.2.3. If S is not found in Frequent, then Frequent = Frequent ? S.

7. Generate association rules for Frequent.

After multi-basket miner is applied and all  association rules are generated, a list of protein  identifiers is retrieved from our database. These  protein ids are the list of target proteins, related to he  discovered associations by DruTiMine.

4. DruTiMine case studies and usage  scenario   DruTiMine has been tested using cancer disease  for eight different tissues: breast, kidney, ovarian,  prostate, pancreatic, liver, skin, and lung. For each  type of cancer, we retrieved multiple microarray  experiments and follow the process as described  above. We used the following protein characteristics:  Protein function, motif, 3D structure, interaction and  related data for each protein, Gene which holds the  information of the protein?s chemical Compound and  chemical reaction. We will describe a system usage  scenario based on breast cancer as an example.

Starting with breast cancer, all related microarray  experiments are downloaded from GEO. Furthermore,  a user can choose a specific experiment, by examining  an abstract explaining the purpose of this experiment  and its main goal, as illustrated in Figure 2. For each  experiment, the user interface contains the experiment  identifier, called ExpID, experiment title, and  database, which is GEO in our case.

Each selected experiment, is converted into  MAGE form, through GEO-Modeler in order to obtain  the required content of the microarray experiment. In  addition to ?MAGE-fying? microarray experiments,  selected experiments are annotated in order to find  differentially expressed genes.  Differentially express-  ed genes can be found by several methods: per  experiment, per group of genes, in all existing groups  of genes, and correlated genes in selected experim-  ents. In this example, differentially expressed genes  are identified using t-test analysis, which are ESR1,  CALCR, FLJ10178, CRYAB, PADI4, and HSPA6.

For each differentially expressed gene, the system  searches and collects abstracts of documents, from  Medline database, related to those genes and breast  cancer. Abstracts are analyzed by a Text analysis  engine and Proteins are annotated. For each chosen  disease and tissue, the list of annotated proteins, in the  abstract collection, is retrieved, as illustrated in Figure  3. For the retrieved protein list, protein characteristics  are retrieved from Swissprot database, as well as Gene  Ontology molecular function, Gene Ontology cellular  component, and Gene Ontology biological process.

Furthermore, for each protein, its gene-related  information, including chemical compounds and  chemical reaction related to this protein are retrieved  from KEGG database.  Each retrieved protein can  have more than one Gene Ontology Biological  process, such as ESR2_HUMAN has three biological  processes: cell-cell signaling, estrogen receptor  signaling path-way, negative regulation of cell growth,  regulation of transcription and DNA-dependent.

Figure 4 shows only a part of the multi-basket we can  get for breast cancer protein characteristics.

Having such case of multi-valued categories,  multi-basket miner is applied, where association rules  are generated, describing relationships between protein  Figure 2: Retrieved Microarray Experiments for a Given Disease  Figure 3: Retrieval of Protein       motif, function, 3D structure, interaction, Gene  Ontology molecular function, Cellular component, and  biological process, and Gene-related chemical  compound and chemical reaction, as illustrated in  Figure 5. As a result, these association rules are used  to get protein identifiers/gene/chemical compounds  which might be proposed as drug targets for breast  cancer.   For example, one of the association rules  indicated that Biological Processes: regulation of  transcription, DNA-dependent, is associated with  Cellular Components:  nucleus, when minimum  support equals 4 and minimum confidence equals 0.5.

This association rule suggests that proteins having  these characteristics are proposed to be drug targets for  breast cancer, which are  ESR2_HUMAN, Q15636_HUMAN,  Q9H2M1_HUMAN, Q9H2M2_HUMAN (Swissprot  protein ids).

A similar procedure is applied for chemical  compounds.

5. Discussion   Applying DruTiMine on several tissues for cancer  has proven the validity of the system, where text  mining and association rule mining are used based on  microarray experiments to identify drug targets for the  specified disease and tissue type. DruTiMine can help  pharmaceuticals to identify drug targets of  proteins/genes/chemical compounds (in silicon)  instead of going through major steps of laboratory  tests (in vitro). This does not mean that laboratory  tests will not be needed, but the need for systems like  DruTiMine is becoming a must for providing guidance  to experts before conducting laboratory experiments.

Microarray experiments have proven, through  DruTiMine, to be very useful for deriving drug targets  of proteins/genes/chemical compounds. The system is  capable of relating proteins identified in Medline  database abstracts to differentially expressed genes in  microarray experiments and provided insight on  possible associations among a variety of related  biological information such as gene molecular  functions, gene biological process and gene cellular  components, which is definitely of value in speeding  up the drug target discovery phase of the drug  discovery process.

6. Conclusions and future work   DruTiMine has been introduced as a new system  for identifying drug targets based on microarray  experiments.  Given a user-selected disease and  associated criteria, as mentioned above, the user can  identify drug targets related to this disease starting  with microarray experiments.  We have explained the  architecture, process and usage scenario of how to  discover drug targets through the integration between  text mining and association rule mining. We have  tested our system to cancer with eight different tissues:  breast, kidney, ovarian, prostate, pancreatic, liver,  skin, and lung.  In our future work, we will develop a  protein-protein interaction network, describing the  type of interaction we can extract from related  publications in order to understand the type of  interaction affecting diseases. Finally, regarding our  microarray experiments? retrieval, we intend to  consider other microarray databases, such as  ArrayExpress and Stanford microarray database.
