I.  INTRODUCTION  Association rule mining finds interesting association or correlation relationships among a large set of data items. With massive amounts of data continuously being collected and stored, many industries are becoming interested in mining association rules from their databases. The discovery of interesting association relationships among huge amounts of business transaction records can help in many business decision making processes, such as cross-marketing, market-basket analysis and loss-leader analysis [1].

In Mobile service provider, the analysis result of association rules can assist deciders to develop marketing strategies and advertisement plan. For instance, by analyzing the association between the customer application services on the market?basket, the hidden association was mined on each service, which provide powerful scientific basis for making the bundling sales policy. Furthermore, through analyzing relationship between the customers? background and its fees, a series of bundling-sale strategies can be popularized. Such as relatives and friends service, campus service and so on.

These are typical model for the application of association rule in the data mining. Association rule mining searches for interesting relationships among items in a given data set. Meanwhile, rule support and confidence are two measures of rule interestingness, which respectively reflect the usefulness and certainty of discovered rules. Rules that satisfy both a minimum  support threshold (min_sup) and a minimum confidence threshold (min_conf) are called strong. Such thresholds can be set by users or domain experts.



II. MAJOR CONCEPT IN ASSOCIATION RULE  A. Basic concepts  Let D?{t1,t2, ?tk, ?tn},the task-relevant data, be a set of database transactions where each transaction T is a set of items such that tk={i1, i2,?, im} (k=1,2,3,?,n). The element ij (j=1, 2, m) in tk is named Item [2].

An association rule is an implication of the form X?Y, where X?T, Y?T, and X?Y=?.The rule X?Y holds in the transaction set D with support ,where support is the percentage of transaction in D that X?Y(i.e. both X and Y. This is taken to be support (1), support(X?Y):  Support(X?Y) =| {T: X?Y?T, T?D}|/|D|   (1)  The rule X?Y has confidence in the transaction set D. And confidence is the percentage of transaction in D containing X that also contains Y. This is taken to be the confidence (2), confidence(X?Y)):  confidence(X?Y)=|{T:X?Y  T,T?D}|/|{T:X T,T?D}| (2)  A set of items is referred to as an itemset. An itemset that contain k item is a k-itemsets. If an itemset satisfies minimum support, then it is a frequent itemset. The set of frequent k-itemsets is commonly denoted by Lk.

Given a set of items D, association rule mining is generated the strong rules where support and confidence is respectively greater than the minimum support threshold and the minimum confidence threshold set by users.

B. Classification of association rule  1) classification of association rule In fact, there are many kinds of association rules.

Association rules can be classified in various ways, based on the following criteria:  a) Based on the types of values handled in the rule, the rules can be divided into Boolean association rule and quantitative association rule.

DOI 10.1109/CSNT.2012.108    DOI 10.1109/CSNT.2012.108    DOI 10.1109/CSNT.2012.108     If a rule concerns associations between the presence and absence of items, it is a Boolean association rule. If a rule describes associations between quantitative items or attributes, then it is a quantitative association rule. In these rules, quantitative values for items or attributes are partitioned into intervals.

For example: Sex= ?female? => occupation =?secretary?, is the Boolean association rule; Sex = ?female? =>fees=98, note that the quantitative attribute, fees is discrete. Therefore, that is a quantitative association rule.

b) Based on the levels of abstractions involved in the rule set, the rules could be divided into the single-level association rule and the multi-level association rule.

Some methods for association rule mining can find rules at differing levels of abstraction. If the items in rules are references at different levels of abstraction, the rule set mined is multi-level association rule. If, instead, the rules within a given set do not reference items or attributes at different levels of abstraction, then the set contains single-level association rule.

For example: The feminine official => SMS, it?s a single-level association rule based on a detailed data .The official => SMS, it?s a multi-level association rule between the higher level and the detailed level.

c) Based on the dimensions of data involved in the rule set, the rules could be divided into the single-dimensional association rule and the multi-dimensional association rule  If the items or attributes in an association rule reference only one dimension, then it is a single-dimensional association rule. If a rule references two or more dimensions, then it is a multi-dimensional association rule.

For example, service =?WAP service? => service =?SMS?, this rule is a single-dimensional association rule since it refers to only one dimension, service; For another instance, sex = ?female? and age=25-35 => occupation = ?secretary?, this rule is considered a multi-dimensional association rule since it involves three dimensions: sex, age, occupation.

2) Mining multi-level and multi-dimensional association rules  With the development of the research on data warehouse and OLAP, the massive amounts of data will be integrated, preprocessed and then stored into data warehouse. At present, most applications of data warehouse analyze OLAP and establish multi-dimension.

With the progress of the data mining research, the ways combined with OLAP and data mining have been came up.

An effective method of data mining is able to carry out an exploratory data analysis. Users often want to select relevant data in the database to analyze on the different detail levels, to present knowledge with various forms. OLAP-based mining can provide the mining on different data sets and different details and provide the  operation of slicing, dicing, starting and filtering. Then, with some visual tools, the flexibility and capacity of data mining can be greatly improved. Thus, the definition of multi-level and multi-dimension association rules as follow:  a) Multi-level association rule For many applications, because of the distribution of  data, it?s very difficult to find some strong association rules in level of detail. After introducing the conceptual level, we can mine at a higher level. Although the rules on a higher level may bring the more general information, it is not common for all of users. Therefore, data mining should provide such a function that mining on many levels.

Classification of multi-level association rules: Based on the levels involved in the rule sets, the multi-level association rules can be divided into intra-level association rule and inter-level association rule.

Mining multi-level association rules could adopt the approaches based on a support - confidence framework.

However, there are something should be considered on the issue of support.

Ming Intra-level association rule can adopt two support strategies:  Using uniform minimum support for all levels: The same minimum support threshold is used when mining at each level of abstraction.

However, the uniform support approach has some difficulties. It is unlikely that items at lower levels of abstraction will occur as frequently as those at higher levels of abstraction. If the minimum support threshold is set too high, it could miss several meaningful associations occurring at low abstraction levels.

If the minimum support threshold is set too low, it may generate many uninteresting associations occurring at high abstraction levels.

Using reduced minimum support at lower levels: Each level of abstraction has its own minimum support threshold. The lower the abstraction level, the smaller the corresponding threshold.

Meanwhile, some filtering task can be done through the mining results from the upper level.

The minimum support threshold in the inter-level association rule should be set according by the minimum support threshold of the lower level of abstraction.

b) Multi-dimensional association rule Multi-dimensional association rule is rule involving  more than one dimension or predicate (e.g., rules relating what a user?s sex as well as the user?s age). If association rule contains a single distinct predicate with multiple occurrences, it is a single-dimensional or intra-dimension     association rule. Association rule that involve two or more dimensions or predicates can be referred to as multi-dimensional association rule. These methods can be organized according to their treatment of quantitative attributes. For example:  Age (X, "below 20) and occupation (X, "student ") ==> service (X," SMS "); the rule involves three predicates (e.g., age, occupation, service).

According to whether to repeat the same predicate in the rule, there are inter-dimensional association rule and hybrid-dimension association rule. Multi-dimensional association rule with no repeated predicates is called inter-dimension association rule. Hybrid-dimension association rule is the multi-dimensional association rule with repeated predicates, which contain multiple occurrences of some predicates. An example of such a rule is the following, where the predicate service is repeated: Age (X, "20 ... 30") and service (X, "SMS") ==> service (X, "WAP service").



III. THE ALGORITHM ANALYSIS OF CLASSIC ASSOCIATION RULE  A. Apriori algorithm In 1993, Agrawal etc. firstly proposed the mining  association rule among itemsets in transactional database [3]. Association rule mining is a two-step process:  Step1: Find all frequent itemsets: By definition, each of these itemsets will occur at least as frequently as a pre-determined minimum support count.

Step2: Generate strong association rules from the frequent itemsets: By definition, these rules must satisfy minimum support and minimum confidence.

Apriori employs an iterative approach known as a level-wise search, where k-itemsets are used to explore (k+1)-itemsets. First, the set of frequent 1-itemsets is found. This set is denoted L1.L1 is used to find L2, the set of frequent 2-itemsets, which is used to find L3, and so on, until no more frequent k-itemsets can be found. The finding of each Lk requires one full scan of the database.

In order to find all the frequent itemsets, the algorithm adopted the recursive method. The main idea is as follows:  L1 = {large 1-itemsets}; for (k=2; Lk-1??; k++) do  { Ck=Apriori-gen (Lk-1);   // the new candidates  for each transactions t?D do//scan D for counts {  Ct=subset (Ck, t); // get the subsets of t that are candidates  for each candidates c? Ct do c.count++; }  Lk={c? Ck |c.count?minsup} }  Return=?kLk; Agrawal consider that all nonempty subsets of a  frequent itemsets must also be frequent. To reduce the size of Ck, pruning is used as follows. If any (k-1)-subset of a candidate k-itemsets is not in Lk-1, then the candidate cannot be frequent either and so can be removed from Ck.

The prune step reduces the cost of calculating all the support of candidate sets by reducing the size of candidate sets, which significantly improves the performance of finding frequent itemsets [4].

B. Improving the efficiency of Apriori Although the Apriori algorithm has been optimized  for a certain amount, there are many unsatisfactory elements in the practical application [5]. The algorithm in this paper introduced the HASH technology to improve the frequent itemsets [6].

The basic ideas of algorithm: In the first iteration of algorithm, each item is a member of the set of candidate 1-itemsets, C1. The algorithm simply scans all of the transactions in order to count the number of occurrences of each item. Then the set of frequent 1-itemsets, L1, can be determined. It consists of the candidate 1-itemsets satisfying minimum support.  to generate a candidate set of Lk?1, the algorithm joins Lk with itself to generate a candidate set of Ck+1. From the above basic principles, the candidate itemsets Ck ? 1 still include all the frequent itemsets Lk?1. Next, the transactions in D are scanned and the support count of each candidate itemsets in Ck+1 is accumulated. Then, the set of frequent (k+1)-itemsets, Lk+1, is determined, consistion of those candidate (k+1)-itemsets in Ck+1 having minimum support. If Ck+1 is an empty itemset, so it is end with the result, Answer=?kLk. Otherwise, it transfers to the step 2 and continue to cycle. Therefore, the key of this algorithm are step 2 and 3.

After frequent itemsets were found out in the transactional database, all the strong association rules were discovered, which met the minimum support and the minimum confidence. Then the degree of confidence was calculated. The algorithm was realized in the data warehouse server with a stored procedure. These candidates and frequent itemsets were stored with some tables, and candidate itemsets were stored with a temporary table. But frequent itemsets were stored with the table AFF_FRE_SUPPORT in the data warehouse. In order to accelerate query speed, the table AFF_FRE_SUPPORT was indexed, and each transaction was stored in the database with HASH technologies. The HASH function (3) is expressed as follows:  17mod)......()( 1010 211 iiiH kkkkk I ++?+?= ???   (3)  Among function (3), K shows that the generated frequent itemsets Lk is K items. And ik means that the PRODUCT_ID number corresponding with a transaction.

Thus the transaction number AFF_ID that is the combination with the result of HASH function and k, was stored in this database. For example, there is such a transaction {Domestic long-distance call |Caller display |SMS|}.Through querying the PRODUCT table, we know that their PRODUCT_ID are {1, 10, 12}. Therefore, this transaction?s AFF_ID is 308 in the database. If we want to query the support of one transaction, the HASH function should be calculated at first .Then, the record is able to quickly find.



IV. THE APPLICATION OF ASSOCIATION RULES  A. Purpose: finding the association rules among businesses.

When customers apply for a service, mobile service providers can give another interesting service for free.

When customers apply for one service, employees can recommend another interesting service.

When deciders make bundling-sale strategies, the associated services can be bound promotion.

B. Data analysis: According to the purpose, the key fields are analyzed to get three rules (Table1):  TABLE 1.  ASSOCIATION RULES AMONG AFFAIRS  Support Confidence Rules  60 75 Call Transfer => WAP 70 70 WAP   => short messages 60 85 domestic long-distance calls => Call  Transfer  The first rule:?the customers who applied for the call transfer also asked for WAP?. Almost 750 people in per 1,000 customers who applied for the call transfer meet this rule. In all customers, there is also 60% of the customers can meet the rule.

The second rule:?the customers who applied for the WAP also asked for the messages?. Almost 700 people in per 1,000 customers who applied for WAP meet this rule.

In all customers, there is also 70% of the customers can meet the rule  The third rule:?the customers who applied for the domestic long-distance also asked for the call transfer?.

Almost 850 people in per 1,000 customers applied for domestic long-distance calls meet this rule. In all customers, there is also 60% of the customers can meet the rule.

C. Analyze conclusions  1) Suggestions for providing active information When the customers apply for the domestic  long-distance calls, call transfer services can be recommended to them.

When the customers apply for the call transfer service, WAP is can be recommended to them.

2) Suggestions for providing promotion information When customers apply for the domestic  long-distance calls, employees take the initiative to promote call transfer service, which would be got a higher turnover rates.

When customers apply for the call transfer service, employees can actively promote WAP service, which would be got a higher turnover rates.

When customers apply for the WAP service, employees take the initiative to promote SMS, which would be got a higher turnover rates.

3) Suggestions for bundling-sale Domestic long-distance calls service and transfer  call service, or transfer call service and WAP service, or WAP service and SMS can be bound promotion.



V. CONCLUSION  Facing with the fierce commercial competition, it?s essential for business organizations to understand the customer's shopping habits. By knowing what products were frequently purchased by customers, the companies can develop the marketing strategies by discovering this association. Therefore, these strategies not only meet the need of the consumers, but also create a lot of value for enterprises. This paper proposed the application of association rules on the decision support systems for mobile service providers, which scientifically assist the enterprises making the huge amounts of data to gain useful information and help them to enhance the market competitiveness.
