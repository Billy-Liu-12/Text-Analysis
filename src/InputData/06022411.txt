I.  INTRODUCTION With the rapid development of computer technology and  the Internet widely, and to bring a new learning and cognitive style, online teaching has become extremely important in modern education in the form. At present domestic universities are developing a series of online teaching system based on the actual circumstances. The teaching system to provide service for faculty and students in different angles. Its biggest advantage is to provide rich learning resources, and making learning from time and space constraints for the learners.

Learners are free to choose their own way, greatly improved the learning effect. But there are also some defects[1]. Firstly, the teaching system of the teaching material is stacked with the well developed lesson plan, the courseware and network information, are lacked of necessary interaction, students can use general website tools such as classified browse, category navigation, search tools to search for study contents. Each learner in learning process can see the same content. The teaching system does not have the characteristics of personality and intelligence. Second, each course of the teaching system is independent, can not reflect the collaborative relationship among the pre-course, parallel course and the follow-up course.

This paper used association rules of personalized recommendation technology[2]. Designed a based on association rules of personalized teaching resources recommendation model. The learner-centered system, the system of teaching resources based on knowledge organization.

Real-time, comprehensive tracking learners online learning behavior, to statistic and analyze the learning information, to obtain learners - knowledge points two-dimensional table. To further get association rules in the table, dynamically recommend personalized content and advice to every learners.



II. PERSONALIZED TEACHING RESOURCES RECOMMENDATION MODEL SYSTEM STRUCTURE  Personalized teaching resources recommendation model is not completely controlled by the teacher, but at the center of learners to design system and configure resource. It is based on expert knowledge library (EKL) and teaching resources database (TRD), to combine with detailed information of individual students, learning record information, learning characteristics information, online testing information, and to analyze learning interest, study habits, cognitive ability and lack of knowledge of the students.  Association rules algorithm produces association rules in the personalized recommendation model, thus to recommend learning content and recommendations to the learner's that are suited for learners personality characteristics. Assist learners to learn and promote the learners to construct knowledge. Therefore, personalized teaching resources recommendation model is composed of three aspects: user module (UM), teaching resources modules (TRM) and personalized recommendation module[3][4] (PRM).  Relationship between the various components of the composition is shown in Fig. 1.

III. USER MODULE In personalized recommendation system, the users include  learners and teachers. Learner-centered, teachers can organize and manage the teaching resources database, to provide learners with personalized service.

A. Teachers user Teachers login system should not only update teaching  resources database but also need to manage the learners' characteristics, realize learning progress of the learners promptly, the master degree of knowledge points, the questions appeared in the learning process, learning interest and the learning history records of learners, and thus aimed at the characteristics of different learners to choose different learning content to further recommend, and further guidance on the learning of the learners. To improve the purpose of the learner motivation and learning efficiency.

B. Learners  user Learners login system should firstly register learner?s basic  information. Not only include generally information such as name, sex, age etc, but also include the learner's own estimates of cognitive ability, such as their knowledge levels class, cognitive ability levels, preferred learning strategies etc. And then create a personalized learners' characteristics description, according to the learners' learning history, the interactions with the system in the learning process, learning courses of testing results, to create a personalized learners' characteristics description for each learner. And to record the whole learning progress of students from login to exit system, including personal learning progress, the study contents, testing (examination paper which have done, regularly wrong answers and knowledge points), surf the web etc are aimed at the student personal characteristics. All movements and produced results are timely recorded to their own user database, thus for the next time you login in system to produce the user interface for reference. Finally, clustering the learners, we use K - Means clustering algorithm[5], use current learners information as a cluster center, according to the learners' basic information and individualized model analysis, using cosine similarity measurement methods, to find the most similar "nearest neighbor" sets to the current learners. From "the nearest neighbor" sets search learners' learning paths, and then to the current students personalized recommendation. Reach a wider range of like-minded communication and interaction between learners.



IV. TEACHING RESOURCES MODULE Teaching resources is the core knowledge elements of the  personalized recommendation system. Mainly includes expert knowledge library and teaching resource database.

A. Expert knowledge library   Expert knowledge library is a variety of teaching strategies of summed up by an experienced teacher according to the different teaching contents and different objects, such as: gradually method, repeated circulation method, the focus jump method, summarized method, problem driving method, case analysis method etc. To produce teaching strategy for personalized recommendation module, and to recommend personalized for different learners.

B. Teaching resource database Teaching resource database gathered rich teaching  materials, teaching experience, teaching methods. Rational organization of teaching resources determines the effect of personalized recommendation. The organizational structure of teaching resource in this paper is shown in Fig. 2. Teaching resources, knowledge objects and knowledge point tree structure represents three levels of knowledge organization in the system[6]. Because the teachers will divide the teaching course into knowledge points to teach during the course of lesson. Thus this paper adopts the basic unit of regular knowledge representation method at the center of knowledge.

The basic principle of organization based on textbooks, using refinement of ideas, divided into chapters, sections, subsections, knowledge unit, knowledge points and so on several levels. Each knowledge point can be seen as a relatively independent knowledge. A course is composed of a number of knowledge points, to describe the precursor and successor relationship among the knowledge points by the knowledge tree. So it will constitute system structure of this course, teaching resource database are composed of all courses. The learners can study from front to back through the knowledge tree relationship chart, can also be based on the content keywords you want to know recommended by system to personalize learning.

V. PERSONALIZED RECOMMENDATIONS MODULE According to teaching Resources for the organizational  structure of knowledge points, we use the Apriori algorithm personalized recommendations [7][8].

A. Classic Apriori algorithm Classic Apriori algorithm basic idea is to generate specific  size of candidate item sets, and then scans the databases and count to determine whether these candidate item sets frequently or not. Detailed realization process:  ?  Firstly, scan the database of all the transactions to calculate the number of occurrences of each project,    Course1  Course2  ??  Coursen  TRD K-point1  K-point2  ??  K-pointn  K-point1  ??  K-pointk     produce 1 candidate set C1. Again according to pre-determined minimum support 1 - frequent set L1.

? Then L1 * L1: connect operator generates 2 candidate sets C2, Scans the database again all transactions, and calculates the number of occurrences of each element of C2, and based on given pre-determined minimum support 2 - frequent set L2.

?  The process is repeated until the generated k - frequent set Lk and could not be generated to meet the minimum support of k+1 item sets. For j candidate set Cj (j = 3..., k), if one (j - l) subset of an element is not (j - 1) frequent set, will be deleted.

Algorithm terminates, it means that all the frequent item sets has been found. Association rules can be generated as follows: for each frequent item sets L, generate all non-empty subset of L, for each non-empty subset s of the set L, if   ?min_conf  Support_count(L)  Support_count(s)   The output rule ?s => (L-s)?, one ?min_conf? is the minimum confidence threshold.

B. Improve Apriori  algorithm Classic Apriori algorithm adopted layered iterative search  method, the algorithm is simple, but the times of scanning database are too much. When the database is stored in a large number of transaction data, the algorithm will reduce the efficiency of the implementation.

Each study in improving the efficiency of the Apriori Algorithm, mainly towards reducing the calculation and reduce the number of scan database to improve[9]. Such as: Savasere et al. In 1995, the Partition algorithm proposed[10]. From reducing the cost by searching the database, and then improve their overall performance. Chen et al. DHP algorithm proposed[11].

The algorithm has mainly used to cut unnecessary set of candidate projects to improve the efficiency of mining association. And Toivonen, in 1996, the Sampling algorithm[12] proposed and so on.

In this paper, aimed at the organizational structure of teaching resources, we proposed an improved Apriori algorithm is as follows:  1) First, according to the student input to query the contents,  according to the relevant rules between knowledge points to query in teaching resource database, to obtained all the knowledge points relevant to the content set: Knowledgepoints = {Knowledgepoints1, Knowledgepoints2...

Knowledgepointsi}, i = 1, 2, 3... n; n behalf of the number of relevant knowledge points.

2) And then from a clustering centralized of student information database to search all the students information had learned the relevant knowledge points, write to "nearest neighbor" sets: Students = {Student1, Student2,... Studentj}, j = 1, 2, 3... m; m behalf of the number of students.

3) From the ?nearest neighbor? search students browse sequences, produce learners-knowledge points two-dimensional table {(Studentj, Knowledgepointsi)}, j = 1, 2, 3... ; j behalf of student serial number; i = 1, 2, 3... ; i behalf of the knowledge points serial number.

4) Using the classical Apriori algorithm to search for all frequent item sets on the basis of the two-dimensional table, and to make the frequent item sets produce association rules, finally form the recommended knowledge. Algorithm execution in Fig.3.
