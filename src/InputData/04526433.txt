Efficient Kriging via Fast Matrix-Vector Products

Abstract-Interpolating scattered data points is a problem of wide ranging interest. Ordinary kriging is an optimal scat- tered data estimator, widely used in geosciences and, remote sensing. A generalized version of this technique, called cok- riging, can be used for image fusion of remotely sensed, data.

However, it is computationally very expensive for large data sets. We demonstrate the time efficiency and accuracy of ap- proximating ordinary kriging through the use of fast matrix- vector products combined with iterative methods. We used methods based on the fast Multipole methods and nearest neighbor searching techniques for implementations ofthe fast matrix-vector products.

Keywords-geostatistics, image fusion, kriging, approximate algorithms, fast multipole methods, fast Gauss transform, nearest neighbors, iterative methods.
