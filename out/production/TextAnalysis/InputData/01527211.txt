NOVEL MEASUREMENT FOR MINING EFFECTIVE ASSOCIATION RULES

Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the method of  support-confidence framework when mining association rules.

In order to avoid the limitation in the criterion, we propose a new method of match as the substitution of confidence. We analyze in detail the property of the proposed measurement.

Experimental results show that there is higher correlation between the antecedent and the consequent of the rules produced by the improved method compared with the rules produced by the support-confidence framework. Furthermore, the improved method decreases the generation of redundancy rules.

Keywords: Data mining; association rules; correlation; match  1. Introduction  It is an important issue to mine association rules from transaction databases in data mining. Mining association rules is aimed at finding correlations between the different items in a database, which can be used to find the patterns of customer?s purchase such as how the transaction of buying some goods will impact on the transactions of buying others. Such rules can be implemented to design the merchandise shelves, to manage the stock and to classify the customers according to the purchase patterns.

Assume I={i1, i2,?, im} is a binary set, in which parameters i1, i2??im are called items. Define transaction T as the item set with the restriction of T?I. Define D as the transaction set. Let X be the set containing some items in I, and the transaction T will include X if X?T. The length of the item set is defined as the number of the items in it.

Association rules are those implications that can be depicted as X?Y, where X?I, Y?I?and X?Y=?. The support of the rule X?Y in the transaction database D is the ratio between the transaction number including X and Y in the transaction sets and all the transaction number, which can be written as support(X?Y), that is to say  support(X?Y)=|{T:X?Y?T?T?D}|/|D|.

The confidence of the rule X?Y in the transaction sets is the ratio between the transaction number including X and Y and those including X, which can be written as confidence (X?Y), that is to say  confidence (X?Y)=|{T: X?Y?T, T?D}|/|{T: X?T, T?D}|.

To a certain transaction set D, mining association rules means figuring out the association rules whose support and confidence are higher than the minimum support (minsup) and confidence (mincon) respectively. Consequently, mining association rules can be divided into two subissues as follows:  (1) Find out all the item sets, the supports and confidences of which are larger than or equal to the minsup required by the customers. The item sets with minsup are called frequency sets.

(2) Set up association rules through frequency sets.

Finding out all M?s non-empty subsets ms to each frequency set M. Association rule m=>(M-m) can be obtained when support (M)/support (m)>=mincon.

support (M)/support (m) is defined as the confidence of the rule m=>(M-m) where m is the antecedent of the rule and M-m is the consequent of the rule.

The efficiency of the algorithm is very significant because it needs to scan the datasets many times when creating the frequency sets. Thus most current research works focus on the improvement of the efficiency of the algorithm about producing frequency sets. R.Agrawal etc.

proposed the apriori algorithm [1], Park and his colleagues proposed PHD algorithm. There are a lot of other popular research issues, such as the research on the apriori method, the incremental renovation of the association rules, mining effective association rules, mining association rules based on Neural Networks and so on [2-7]. Our work is focused on the improvement on the measurement of mining effective association rules.

2. Measure standards of the association rules  Researchers have been applying the framework of      support-confidence to set up association rules in the process of mining association rules. However a lot of redundant or unrelated rules are also mined when using the framework to find rules. Here we give an example shown in Table 1:   Table 1. a set of transaction data  TID               items 01 R?I?J?C?K?H?M?N 02 R?I?C?K?H?M?N 03 R?I?J?C?E?K 04 R?I?J?E?F?H?N 05 R?I?J?E?F?H 06 R?I?J?E?F 07 R?I?J?E 08 R?I?J?F 09 R?J?E 10 R?J?F   We only discuss certain item sets with the length of 2.

First, assume the minsup and mincon are 0.2 and 0.5 respectively. We can learn that C and K are always present or absent at the same time from Table1, which can be an effective association rule, the support and confidence of C=>K are 0.3 and 1 individually by calculation. We can find that the support and confidence of C=>R are also 0.3 and 1 individually with the same method. Thus we can conclude that rules C=>K and C=>R have same support and confidence from which we can draw the conclusion that both of them are effective association rules. But we can easily learn that R will always present whatever C is present or not. Here we draw the different conclusion that C=>R isn?t an effective association rule. Now we analyze rule F=>E, whose support and confidence are 0.3 and 0.6 respectively, which are both larger than the minsup and the mincon. From this we also draw the conclusion that the rule is an effective association rule. But with further calculation we get P(EF)=P(E)?P(F). E and F are irrelated to each other from the point of mathematics because they are positive correlated to each other if and only if P(EF)>P(E)?P(F).

Otherwise, we say that they are negative correlated. In this paper, we will only discuss the rules between the positive correlated item sets. Many scholars and experts have investigated the correlations among item sets, and defined the correlation threshold in order to reduce the emergence of irrelated rules [8-9]. We can learn that not all rules conforming to the minsup and mincon are effective from the discussion above.

Now we analyze the framework of support-confidence in theory. Assume that support denotes the frequency of item sets? occurrence. We can find out the regularities  exactly only when item sets can occur frequently.

Otherwise, it is hard to find out the regularities included in the item sets. Let confidence denotes the probability that some item sets? emergence will lead to others? occurrence.

But we notice that the confidence of association rule F=>E only considers the possibility of the case when E and F will occur simultaneously, without considering the possibility of the case when only E occur and the case whether E and F are correlated. Then many association rules obtained are ineffective.

3. Improvement of measure standards  According to those problems discussed above, we find that the depiction of confidence is not consummate, it is inadequate to describe the correlation among item sets. The authors [7] applied validity to substitute confidence to produce association rules. Validity is defined as follows:  validity =(probability that X and Y occur simultaneously in database D)-(probability that X and Y occur simultaneously in database D  that is: validity=P(XY)-P( X Y).

We find that the introduction of validity can surely  reduce some redundant rules? occurrence but it doesn?t work on eliminating irrelated rules. Now analyze the rule E=>F in Table 1 whose support = 0.3 and validity=0.3-0.2=0.1. The rule will be an effective association rule according to the method reported in [7]. But we can get P(EF)=P(E)?P(F) by further calculation, which shows that E and F are irrelated to each other. Review the rule I=>J with the support equal to 0.7 and the validity equal to 0.5 calculated by the difference between 0.7 and 0.2, which can also be an effective association rule according to literature[7]. But the calculation equation P(IJ)-P(I) ?P(J)=0.7-0.8?0.9= -0.02 indicate that there is a negative correlation between I and J. So there are also some drawbacks using validity to substitute confidence.

In this paper we apply a new method to take the place of confidence in order to diminish the drawbacks of confidence. We give the concept of match and two requirements have to be fulfilled at the same time when mining association rules.

(1) Find out all the item sets, the supports of which are larger than or equal to minsup in the transaction database D, The item sets with minsup are called frequency sets, otherwise called non-frequency sets.

(2) Set up association rules by frequency sets. To a frequency set M association m=>(M-m) will be set up if m?M and m??, the match of which is not smaller than       the minimum match(minmatch) given by the customer.

Assume that P(A) denotes the probability of A?s  occurrence , P(B) denotes the probability of B?s occurrence, P(AB) denotes the probability of the case  when A and B will occur simultaneously. P( A B) denotes the probability of the case when B occurs but A doesn?t occur, P( A ) denotes the probability of A?s nonoccurrence. Then we define the match of rule A=>B as ?the confidence of  A=>B?-?the confidence of A =>B?, that is?  match= )A(P B) AP(  )A(P )AB(P ?                   (1)  The equation above can also be written as:  match= ))A(P1()A(P  )B(P)A(P)AB(P ??  ?? (2)  We can draw the conclusion that an item set is irrelated to any other item set when its support is 1, in which case we can overlook the match of this item set with other item sets. Then the probability for any item set A? occurrence is 0<P(A)<1.The range of match is [-1 ? 1]. because  0<P(AB)/P(A) ?1 and 0<P( A B)/ P( A )?1. We can find out that P(AB)>P(A)?P(B) if match>0, which proves that A and B are correlated. The conclusion of P(AB)=P(A)=P(B) will be drawn if match=1, which indicates the case that A and B appear simultaneously.

Furthermore we analyze match theoretically. Firstly we define the concept of correlation.

cor= P(B)P(A)  P(AB) ?  (3)  cor1= P(B))AP( B)AP(  ? (4)  Hence we have match=(cor-cor1)?P(B). We can get cor=cor1=1 when cor equal to cor1 for the reason that  cor1= P(A)1  P(A)1 ?  ?? cor . That is to say A will be irrelated  to B when A is irrelated to B. Moreover, corl will be below one while cor is above one. In other words, A will be negatively correlated to B if the case that A is positively correlated to B is true. We can also get from the equation that the definition of match not only includes some correlation factors but also some P(B) factors. So it can display the validity of rule A=>B with the definition of match.

We classify the rules under the framework of support-confidence into four groups when mining  association rules. The first group includes the effective association rules, also the rules that are interesting to the customers. Second includes the redundant rules. Third includes low-relational rules. Four includes hypo-relational rules.

(1)Define redundant rule A=>B which satisfies the situation that P(AB)/ P(A) conforms to the mincon and P(AB)/ P(A)?P( A B)/P( A )  (2) Define low-relational rule A=>B which satisfies the situation that P(AB)/ P(A) conforms to the mincon and match is lower than that given by customers.

(3) Define hypo-relational rule C=>B which satisfies the situation that  match (A=>B)>match(C=>B).

We will discuss over match by manipulating the item  sets with length of 2 in Table 1 again. Assume the minmatch=0.6.

(1)  We will not analyze the match of R with other items for the reason that the probability for R?s existence is 1.

(2)  Test the rule C=>K, where the probability for C?s existence is 0.3, the probability for K?s existence is 0.3, and the probability for both C and K?s existence is 0.3.

Then the match of the rule C=>K can be calculated as match=(0.3-0.3?0.3)/(0.3?(1-0.3))= 1.Obviously, it is an effective association rules.

(3)  Test the rule E=>F, where the probability for E?s existence is 0.6, the probability for F?s existence is 0.5, and the probability for both E and F?s existence is 0.3. Then the match of the rule E=>F can be calculated as match=(0.3-0.6?0.5)/(0.6?(1-0.6))= 0.

(4)  Test the rule H=>E, where the probability for H?s existence is 0.4, the probability for E?s existence is 0.2, and the probability for both H and E?s existence is 0.6.

Then the match of the rule H=>E can be calculated as match=(0.2-0.4?0.6)/(0.4?(1-0.4))= -0.167.

(5)  Test the rule M=>N, where the probability for M?s existence is 0.2, the probability for N?s existence is 0.3, and the probability for both M and N?s existence is 0.2.

Then the match of the rule M=>N can be calculated as match=(0.2-0.2?0.3)/(0.2?(1-0.2))= 0.875.

(6)  Test the rule H=>N, where the probability for H?s existence is 0.4, the probability for N?s existence is 0.3, and the probability for both H and N?s existence is 0.3.

Then the match of the rule H=>N can be calculated as match=(0.3-0.4?0.3)/(0.4?(1-0.4))= 0.75.

(7) Test the rule I=>J, where the probability for I?s existence is 0.8, the probability for J?s existence is 0.9, and the probability for both I and J?s  existence is 0.7. Then the match of the rule I=>J can be calculated as match=(0.7-0.8?0.9)/(0.8?(1-0.8))= -0.125.

We can find that the match of E=>F is 0 from those calculations above, which means E and F are irrelated, and the rule we get is a redundant rule. Here we regard the rules of H=>E and I=>J are redundant rules for their match are both lower than 0, while the negative rules of which may be worthy for studying. The rule of H=>N is hypo-relational rule for the reason that match(M=>N)> match(H=>N), whose true merit will be lower than that of the rule of M=>N. There are only two effective association rules (2)? (5) in the six situations discussed above.  0        2 3.5 4 4.5 5.5 6.5 8.124  record number  ru le  s n um  be r  confidence- rule match-rule  4. Results and discussion  We can surely find that implementing the concept of match can reduce the occurrence of redundant rules and low-relational rules theoretically. In this section, we adopt the data from a mushroom database to validate the feasibility of this measure method. This experiment is carried out on a Legend computer, 256M memory, 2.0GHz.

Frequency sets are produced by apriori method, the rules produced by which are compared with those produced under the framework of support-confidence. The comparison is divided into two aspects: First one compares the number of the association rules produced by two methods. Second aims to compare whether support-match framework can mine effective rules and to reduce the low-relational rules. Now we compare the first aspect: In Fig. 1, the parameters are set as follow:  In support-confidence framework, minsup=0.6, mincon=0.75  In support-match framework, minsup=0.6, minmatch=0.5 The testing results are shown in Fig. 1,the abscissa denotes the record number ? 1000, the ordinate denotes the number of rules produced ?1000. We can find that the rule number under support-match framework is obviously reduced.

To the second aspect, in the mushroom database, there are 23 attributes containing in each record in the database, where the first 22 are condition attributes, each of which can have several attribute values. The last one is decision attribute, which has the value of edible and poisonous. The purpose of mining association rules is to find out which condition attribute?s occurrence can lead to edible or poisonous. Now we will analyze whether support-match framework can mine effective association rules and decrease low-relational rules or not. Parameters are given as follows:  In support-confidence framework, minsup=0.4, mincon=0.7.

In   support-match   framework,  minsup=0.4,  Figure 1 comparison of the number of the rules   minmatch=0.6.

Here we compare two rules respectively which are from the two methods, the first rule is:  free?white?partial?one?no==>poisonous Condition attributes act as the antecedent of the rule  and decision attributes act as the consequent of the rule. In the framework of support?confidence, confidence=0.772; support=0.401 in the support-match framework, match=0.6;support=0.401. Therefore, we can find that the two methods can both mine effective association rules.

Now we discuss another rule:  white?partial?no==>poisonous We get confidence=0.723; support=0.406 under the framework of support-confidence. But we get match=0.726-0.175=0.551 in the framework of support-match, which doesn?t comply with the minmatch.

So it is a low-relational rule. Then analyze the correlation among the item sets, P(white?partial?no, poisonous)- P(white?partial? no)?P(poisonous)=0.40558-0.27077=0.125.

It is easy to find that this rule has lower correlation.

The result of the experiment shows that the proposed  support-match framework can not only mine effective association rules but also reduce the occurrence of low-relational rules. By doing so, we can safely announce that the rules provided to customers are highly correlated.

5. Conclusion  In this paper, we discuss and analyze the measure standards of the support-confidence framework as well as the limitation of it and propose the support-match framework to take the place of support-confidence framework. The proposed measure standard has the advantages of reducing the creation of redundant rules and low-relational rules. Moreover, we can also apply other methods to improve the frequency sets when producing       frequency sets.
