Making Time Just Another Axis in Geospatial Services

Abstract?The use of large multidimensional, complex datasets to study the roots and the consequences of real-world phenomena is systematically gaining importance in the recent years. These datasets and their requisite metadata can be managed by queryable databases, and the increasing processing capabilities of distributed computing and Array DBMS are opening new scenarios for Web-based access and analysis.

The spatio-temporal nature of these observations requires the establishment of an automated machine-readable system that seamlessly accounts for time as not just an attribute, but rather as one more axis in the n-dimensional structure. This paper proposes a conceptual framework for the integration of temporal with spatial dimensions. Based on the widely used Geography Markup Language (GML) it exploits temporal Coordinate Reference Systems (CRSs) in analogy to, and interoperable with, well-known spatial CRSs. The proposed approach is then concretely applied to the OGC Web protocols Web Coverage Service (WCS) and Web Coverage Processing Service (WCPS), by means of which a user can visualize, aggregate, process remotely stored archives of scientific data.

It is based on an open-source CRS resolver, SECORE, which translates URL identifiers of CRSs into their GML definitions.

SECORE has been adopted by OGC as its standard CRS resolver, and the whole concept is supported by an ad-hoc OGC working group.

I. INTRODUCTION The increasing availability of multidimensional scientific  datasets is giving room to a always wider range of applica- tions that can take advantage of jointly spatial and temporal analytics capabilities [1]. In particular, Earth monitoring via satellites and remote sensing technologies offers a powerful mean for analyzing long-term datasets that are crucial for a clearer understanding of phenomena and thus for prevention; rising atmospheric CO2 or the Antarctic ozone hole were indeed discovered by a fruitful analysis of spatio-temporal datasets.

Developing applications can transversely span a variety of different domains, from land use [2] to cryosphere analysis [3], from environmental heritage [4] to planetary sciences [5], and more. The mere visualization of the data is usually not enough if not accompanied by analysis and consequently adequate processing capabilities [1]. The rising of distributed computing resources as commodity services and the systematic development of Array DBMSs ([6], [7]) are making it possible to achieve important speed increases for analyses.

Alongside, the consolidation and advancements of stan- dards for the geospatial realm ([8], [9]) are creating premises for open interconnectedness and interoperability of location-based web services. In particular, the Geography Markup Language (GML) ? the XML grammar defined by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) ? is a description of application schemas, transport and storage of geographi- cal features, as they are described in the ISO 19100 series of standards and the OpenGIS Abstract Specification. Among the several conceptual models covered by GML (e.g. spatial geometries, coverages, units of measure), of particular inter- est for this work are the schemas for Coordinate Reference Systems (CRSs), a key aspect of geoscience datasets, and their application to gridded coverages.

In [10] the authors described the advantages of a GML-oriented approach for referencing geospatial data when implementing services on the web, and this inevitably needs to include a proper management of the temporal information. Time should not be meant as just an additional attribute, e.g. support information, but should be integrated in the model of a coverage as a coordinate on its own, wrapping time series of data onto a single object, this way extending querying and processing capabilities of web services to the temporal dimension [11]. This is eagerly awaited by the scientific community, including geo image services ([12], [13]), the Model Web ([14], [15]), or geolog- ical sciences [16].

In this article we will propose a framework for serv- ing regular/irregular time series of datasets by means of spatio-temporal CRSs in an OGC-oriented Web environ- ment, and by seamless integration of the temporal dimen- sion in the generic n-dimensional space of analysis, with focus on the implications for the OGC Web Coverage Service (WCS) [17] and Web Coverage Processing Service (WCPS) [18]. After an overview of related works in Sec. II, Sec. III will introduce the syntax behind the specification and web-based retrieval of CRS definitions; Sec. IV will describe how GML addresses the recording of temporal coordinates as well as the concepts of the proposed framework; practical examples are presented in Sec. V; conclusions are eventually drawn in Sec. VI.



II. RELATED WORKS  The extension of spatial data models to the temporal dimension in a unified manner is a crucial aspect when  2013 20th International Symposium on Temporal Representation and Reasoning  DOI 10.1109/TIME.2013.24   2013 20th International Symposium on Temporal Representation and Reasoning  DOI 10.1109/TIME.2013.24   2013 20th International Symposium on Temporal Representation and Reasoning  DOI 10.1109/TIME.2013.24   2013 20th International Symposium on Temporal Representation and Reasoning  DOI 10.1109/TIME.2013.24     investigating dynamic phenomena [19]. Augmenting spatial modelling and analytics capabilities with temporal semantics has been addressed in in many areas of geosciences, dating back at least twenty years [20].

In recent years there has been a growing attention on the field of spatio-temporal databases and how to query on them [21]. Such databases deal with geometries which can change over time in order to provide a DBMS data model and SQL-integrated query language capable of handling time-dependent geometries [22].

The proposed URI-based model of referring to a temporal dimension can be applied independently of the type of geometry of the desired feature, whether it is a point cloud over time, a time series of images, a trajectory, and so on.

This architecture might be seen as an additional extension, to be built on top of spatio-temporal databases to enable an online, and most of all interoperable, query interfaces.

Regarding OGC standardizations, this is not the first effort to establish a first-class citizen temporal dimension: for instance, Web Map Service (WMS) ? most notably implemented by open-source geoservices like MapServer and GeoServer [23] ? is working on the visualization of multidimensional gridded data with temporal capabilities via a ?TIME? parameter [24]. Time is treated as a special dimension, with mechanisms different from spatial selection.

The hereby discussed schema tends instead to a uniform inclusion of time, with no particular special treatment with respect to other spatial axes in the n-D aquarium.

Outside the context of OGC there are other ever-growing initiatives for temporal analysis of features and time- geography.

For instance, an international group of archaeologists, geoscientists, and experts in geomatics and data acquisition is emerging with the common goal of developing an inter- national data standard for archaeological 4D data [25].

The R environment for statistical computing can already offer packages for the analysis of spatio-temporal datasets of different natures (e.g. points, grids, trajectories) with first- class citizen time analysis, as well as space-time statistical modelling tools [26].

Still at an early stage, the temporal extension for PostgreSQL, PostTIME [27], is currently being developed, and it is capable to manage different types of temporal reference, based on either temporal coordinates, calendars and as well ordinal systems.

In all these cases, still there is a lack of flexibility when it comes to define custom CRSs for time, and usually one cannot have more than one single temporal dimension.

Indeed, one of the key-point of our proposal is the free- dom to generate custom ad-hoc temporal reference systems, and to attach one or more of them to the owned datasets.

Several services need to define custom geospatial (or plane- tary) CRSs, and many of them can be fetched from Spatial Reference [28] in different formats, GML included. Our  inherently distributed URI-oriented CRS resolver could co- exist with it providing means for composing spatio-temporal CRSs that reliably host the data to be served, independently of the internal architectures.



III. CRS IDENTIFICATION  Coordinate Reference Systems contain all the information necessary to precisely relate abstract coordinates to concrete physical locations, in either space or time. As such they are at the heart of all applications dealing with real-world data, when the knowledge of its unique physical coordinates is essential. CRSs can be fully described in several machine- understandable languages, including Geography Markup Language (GML) and Well-Known Text (WKT).

Communicating complete CRS definitions is rather im- practical, especially since a vast majority of the GIS appli- cations rely on some commonly accepted standard Spatial Reference System Identifiers (SRID). Concerning geospatial CRSs, virtually all major spatial vendors have created their own SRID implementation or refer to those maintained by an authority, such as the Oil and Gas Producers (OGP) Surveying and Positioning Committee. The EPSG SRID value for the WGS84 CRS is 4326 for example. Based on SRID codes and the now deprecated CRS URN identi- fiers [29], we have devised a simple, expressive, and HTTP compatible mechanism for CRS identification and definition management. A brief overview is given here; for full details we refer the reader to [30], [31].
