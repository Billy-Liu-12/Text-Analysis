Abstract:   This article carried the statistical measurement on the situation of residents? income gap in our country, based on 6937 urban and rural residents? questionnaires from 31 provinces; and it made statistical analysis and evaluation on problems of residents? income gap moderation, such as: the basic judgment to residents? income gap moderation at this stage, the main reasons for the widening residents? income gap, endurance of the public residents to the widening income gap and satisfaction to the income distribution, the consequences caused by the aggravation of income distribution inequity, the relationship between fairness and efficiency at this stage and the main features of unfairness to rural residents, the main factors and risks affecting social stability and hindering economic efficiency, the policy focus on promoting fair distribution. The results show that: the residents? income gap of our country is large, the Gini coefficient has exceeded the warning line, the per capita income of households and the income gap is quite different because of the differences in urban and rural areas and regions, and the basic characteristics and human capital of the head of household; the residents? income gap at this stage is beyond a reasonable boundary; "trading for money and power, rent-seeking and corruption" is the main reason for the widening of income gap; residents? affordability to the widening income gap is strong, but they are not satisfied with the state of the income distribution; the main possible consequence caused by the aggravation of income distribution inequity is "the increase in the degree of social instability"; "the initial distribution and redistribution should handle the relationship between efficiency and equity, with particular emphasis on equity of redistribution"; compared with urban residents, "education", "social security" and "public infrastructure" are the main features of unfairness to rural residents; "corrupt officials" and "big wealth gap" are the main factors and risks affecting social stability and hindering  Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71173189), the Specialized Research Fund for Doctoral Program of Higher Ph.D. class topics (20123326110003) and the Soft Science Research Project of Zhejiang Province (2012C35018)  the economic efficiency; "ban illegal incomes, punish corruption" is the most important measure of promoting fair distribution and narrowing the income gap. On this basis, this article puts forward the corresponding policy recommendations.

Keywords: income gap moderation, questionnaire survey, Gini Coefficient, fairness, efficiency  1 Introduction   The moderation problem of income gap is not only the problem of efficiency and fairness on economics, but also related to the social harmony and stability. Moderate income gap is beneficial to improving the production efficiency and optimizing the allocation of resources.

However, if the income gap is too large and the tendency of broadening can?t be suppressed, it is likely to affect the sustained economic growth and social stability and equity[1]. Since the reform and opening, with the sustained and rapid economic growth, the income level of residents in China continues to rise up and the quality of life improves significantly, while the residents? income gap is broadening unceasingly. Hence, the theoretical and empirical research on the income gap moderation can reveal the nature and crux of the problem of income gap, and is helpful in the search for the countermeasures to narrow the income gap of residents, which has very important theoretical significance and practice value for the government to establish scientific and reasonable income distribution policy, to regulate and control the income gap effectively and to promote the harmonious development of economy and society.

There are a few related researches about the moderation problem of resident income gap at home and aboard. The main viewpoints are as follows: on the connotation of income gap moderation, the research group from the Academy of Macroeconomic Research of the State Planning Commission(2001,2002)[2][3] made whether it would stimulate economic growth and the public subjective endurance level as two basic principles to judge income gap moderation. Shen Shibo(2005)[4] thinks, the moderate income gap is the gap with a Gini coefficient that in an appropriate interval, neither too big    July 17-19, 2013                                 Harbin, P.R.China    - 1075 -   nor too small. Fan Lishu(2005)[5] thinks that the moderate income gap should be compatible with a certain level and stage of economic development, not only can support or promote the sustainable economic development, but also is conductive to social stability and advancement. Wen Kui and Ren Hongyan(2007)[6] think, the influence of income gap on the social and economic system is embodied in two aspects of efficiency and fairness, the understanding of the relationship between efficiency and fairness is the benchmark of income gap moderation. Li Jiong and Zhang Ying(2007)[7]93 think, reasonable income gap refers to the existence and expansion of income gap can produce productive efforts and economic growth motivation, on the contrary, the existence or expansion of the income gap is not associated with the element contribution, even deviates from the performance principle of distribution, it is unreasonable income gap. Liu Chengli(2008)[8] think, fairness and efficiency are the common standards to draft distribution policy and measure the allocation effect. Wang Shaoguo and Chang Jian(2010)[9] consider, the most moderate income gap always corresponds to a certain stage, at different stages of development, the most moderate income gap will develop and change, which will form a social trajectory of the most moderate income gap. Sun Jinshui and Huang Yuanyuan(2012)[10] consider, residents? income gap moderation refers to the income gap which is in coordination with the economic growth, resource allocation, fair distribution of income and social stability in a certain period of time, within a certain range.

On the judgment and evaluation of the income gap moderation of residents at the present stage of our country, scholars have various views with big differences.

The main viewpoints are as follows: Chen Zongsheng and Zhou Yunbo(2002)[11]deem, the income gap of our country is moderate, although the income gap in both absolute gap, or gap expanded, but income levels are generally improving, the social order is stable, so this gap is recognized at present. Li Jiong and Zhang Ying (2007)[7]89-94 think that our country has not appeared polarization, at least only can be regarded as a differentiation. Wang Shaoguo and Wang Zhen(2009)[12] have made empirical test of moderate level of the gap between urban and rural, and results show that the income gap between urban and rural in China has deviated from the moderate level, which must be adjusted. Zhao Renwei and Li Shi(1999)[13] consider that Chinese residents? income gap shows the trend of full expansion, the Gini coefficient has already exceeded the reasonable range, if not being administrated timely, China may appear polarization to affect social stability.

Zeng Guoan(2003)[14] thinks that China? s Gini coefficients, looking from stat- ic transverse, has exceeded the internationally recognized warning line of the unequal distribution, showing that the income gap has "deteriorated" properties; from the perspective of vertical development, distribution conditions deteriorate further with the deepening of the process of  marketization. Xu Xianxiang and Wang Haigang (2008)[15] investigated the evolution of income distribution of the country in the initial distribution, and discovered that our residents? factor income grew generally, but in the growth process, low income residents? income growth was slow, high income?s was rapid, showing the polarization. Sun Jinshui and Dong Lifeng?s (2012)[16] study shows that our country?s resident income gap showed a tendency to expand from 1990 to 2010, the state of income gap in general is not appropriate or not appropriate basically.

In general, the researches in academic circle are more about the current situation, cause and influence at present, but less about the problem of resident income gap moderation, most of them limit to theoretical research and the empirical analysis is relatively weak, lacking of first-hand research information, dedicated questionnaire survey and quantitative investigation, what?s more, there is almost no literatures based on extensive research data about the statistical analysis and evaluation of the problem of resident income gap moderation. Therefore, we organize this questionnaire survey of residents? income gap moderation. On one hand, the survey data obtained can help us to carry out statistical analysis and assessment on residents? income gap moderation issues; on the other hand, it can also provide reference for government to formulate corresponding policies.

Overall, the most research of academia is about the status, causes and effects of the income gap, and it?s enriched our understanding of the income gap problem, but most of the existing research is limited to the meso or macro level, and its main limitation is not to detect hidden micro-level factors which behind these economic issues. The use of survey data, in-depth analysis from the microscopic individual factors on the income gap is relatively rare, however, micro data covering the detailed behavior of decision-makers information, easy to dig more fundamental factors in empirical research. The research of income gap requires high quality survey data, but it?s difficult to obtain such kind of data due to various reasons. These data are difficult to reflect the rapidly changing realities even if we?ve gotten some representative data, because our country is in a period of economic and social transformation, economic structure has also undergone some new changes. A certain impact on the social, economic and political changes in the pattern of income and the income gap, but because of there is no new first-hand survey data, research in these areas is less, and timeliness is not strong. This is the topic what our paper need to study.

The existing research on the moderation of the income gap is few, and it?s mainly limited to theoretical research. Empirical analysis is relatively weak, because its lack of first-hand research data, specialized survey and quantify the investigation, and there almost no paper which based on extensive research data on the moderation issues of the income gap related to statistical analysis and evaluation. Satisfaction from aspects of the    - 1076 -   "basic judgment about moderate income gap at this stage, the main reason for the widening of the income gap between residents, public endurance of the widening income gap and the satisfaction of the income distribution, the consequences the intensified income distribution inequities may lead to, the relationship of fairness and efficiency at this stage and which kind of distributive justice is most important, mainly unfair to rural residents, the main factors to affect social stability and hinder economic efficiency and risk, the policy priorities of promoting equitable distribution "are designed the income gap moderation outline of the questionnaire and then conducted a survey of urban and rural residents on the country?s 31 provinces (sent out 10000 questionnaires), draw the seven conclusions which have a distinctive and instructive significance. Based on the survey results, we concluded six corresponding policy recommendations, providing an important reference for government departments to develop appropriate policies. And the content which mentioned above is the innovation point and the difference between the existing researches.

2 Research methods and survey samples  2.1 Research methods  In the long-term, theoretical circles form a lot of analytical methods and indicators to measure the gap in studying the income distribution. Evaluation indexes include the standard deviation, the Coefficient of Variation, the Gini coefficient, Theil index, Atkinson index and Kuznets ratio; these indicators have their own characteristics and have different emphases in practical applications. Theoretical circles used the Coefficient of Variation, the Gini coefficient and Theil index to measure the income gap on the basis of five properties of Anonymity, independence, Population Transfer Principle, Strong Lorentz, consistency (Wan, 2004) [17]. And this is the measurement which is used in this paper.

(1)Coefficient of Variation (CV).The formula is: ?? /)(1   2? =  ?= n  i iyn  CV              (1)  which, n  is the number of samples, iy  is the individual income of i-th sample, ?  =  = n  i iyn 1  1?  is the  average income on all samples.

(2)Gini coefficient. Gini coefficient was first  proposed by Gini in 1910 and was given in the form of a continuous function, but the process of the data in practical applications is often discrete individuals, this article proposes the following formula by Sen (1973) [18]:  ? =  +??+= n  i iyinnn  G  2 )1( ?  (2)  (3)Generalized Entropy index (GE). Theil (1967) [19]applied the concept of entropy into the inequality measure. Then, Shorrocks(1980) [20] extended it to the Generalized Entropy index, which is calculated as:     1 1 [( ) 1)] 0,1 ( 1)  1( ) ln( ) 1  1 ln( ) 0  n i  i  n i i  i  n  i i  y n  y yEG n  n y  ? ? ? ? ?  ? ? ? ?  ? ?  =  =  =  ? ? ? ?? ??  ? = ? =?  ? ?  =? ?  ?  ?  ?  (3)  When a = 1, )1(EG  is the Theil index. In this paper, we use )1(EG  as a measure of the income gap formula.

2.2 Survey samples and its components  In the first half of 2012, National Natural Science Foundation of ?the Measurements and Early Warning of Residents? Income Gap Moderation? Task Force carried out a survey of urban and rural residents of the country?s 31 provinces, a total of 10000 questionnaires were distributed, including urban and rural residents of each of 5000 questionnaires distributed. The survey covers 19 industries, 9663 copies of questionnaires were returned, the recovery rate is 96.6%. From the returned questionnaires, we removed where personal information is incomplete, no to answer income or income for the 0, as well as personal property is not logical; end up with 6937 valid samples (including 4085 and 2852 copies of urban and rural valid sample respectively). Effective recovery rate is 69.4%.

3 Measurement and analysis of the status quo of Chinese residents? income gap   Looking at the results of questionnaires statistics from the national urban and rural residents, the per capita annual income of households in 2011 is 26807? yuan.

Three indicators to measure residents? personal income gap (using equation (1) (2) (3)), the coefficient of variation, the Gini coefficient, Theil index are 1.209, 0.489, 0.437 by order (see Tab.1), showing that the residents? income gap has exceeded the warning line, the income gap of our nation is large.

Inspecting from area differences, the per capita annual income of households in urban area is 31094 yuan, while it is 20666 yuan in rural area in 2011. Seeing from the income gap indicators, the Gini coefficient and Theil index of the per capita annual income of urban residents are 0.420,0.318, and that of rural residents are 0.568, 0.634. Both of the Gini coefficients are more than the cordon of 0.4. The Gini coefficient of rural residents? income has exceeded 0.5, indicating that rural residents? income gap is very large. And the income gap of rural area is higher than that of urban area.

Visiting from the perspective of regional differences, per capita household income of eastern China in 2011 is 32424 yuan, much higher than that of central (15890   ?In this paper, we use the urban residents? per capita disposable income and rural residents? per capita net income to calculate household annual per capita income with the urban population and rural population of the total population as the weight.

- 1077 -   yuan) and western region (15614 yuan). And the per capita household income of eastern region is more than 2 times of middle and western region. The income gap ca- used by geographical differences rooted in the imbalance of regional economic development. The economic bases, urbanization rate, residents? education opportunities, natural conditions of agricultural production, all of them are better than that of middle and western region. On the other hand, since the reform and opening up, the income gap exacerbated by the expansion of this difference to the economy advancing from east to west sequence and regional imbalance development strategy taken by China.

While in the point of the income gap indicators, the Gini coefficient and Theil index of eastern part of the per capita household income were 0.469, 0.403, much higher than that of middle and western region(sequentially 0.431, 0.319 and 0.452, 0.352, Tab.1)  Inspecting from the gender differences, the per capita annual incomes of national male-headed and female-headed households in 2011 are 27963 yuan and 24620 yuan respectively, the ratio of them is 1.14,  showing that the per capita annual income of male- headed households is higher than that of female-headed.

While in the point of the income gap indicators, the Coefficient of Variation, Gini coefficient, and Theil index of per capita annual income of male-headed families are 1.251, 0.502, 0.464 successively. While these indicators of female-headed households are 1.086, 0.459, 0.374 by order, displaying that the income gap of male-headed household is higher than that of female.

Inspecting from the nation differences, the per capita annual incomes of Han and Minority in 2011 are 27239 yuan and 15051 yuan successively, the ratio of them is 1.81, demonstrating that the per capita annual income of Han families is significantly higher than that of minority families. This has nothing to do with ethnic discrimination, may be due to the majority of minority residents living in the less developed and remote areas, resulting in lower average income levels. While in the point of the income gap indicators, the coefficient of variation, Gini coefficient, Theil index of annual household income of Han and Minority residents are   Tab.1 Results of questionnaire survey of household per capita annual income and income gap  Groups Number of samples Proportions Per Capita  Annual Income of Households  Coefficient of  Variation  Gini Coefficient Theil Index  Whole Country 6937 100 26807 1.209 0.489 0.437 Urban and  Rural Areas  Urban 4085 58.87 31094 0.997 0.42 0.318  Rural 2852 41.1 20666 1.614 0.568 0.634  Regional  East 4600 66.31 32424 1.146 0.469 0.403  Middle 1152 16.61 15890 0.908 0.431 0.319  West 1185 17.08 15614 0.956 0.452 0.352  Gender Male 4538 65.4 27963 1.251 0.502 0.464  Female 2399 34.57 24620 1.086 0.459 0.374  Nation Han 6691 96.43 27239 1.204 0.487 0.435  Ethnic minority 246 3.55 15051 0.94 0.453 0.351  Age  16-30 202 2.91 27915 1.097 0.432 0.359  31-40 352 5.07 28909 1.099 0.486 0.418  41-50 5516 79.52 26760 1.195 0.485 0.429  51-60 833 12.01 26628 1.353 0.519 0.51  Over 60  34 0.49 11174 0.989 0.502 0.42  Education Level  Primary School and Below 723 10.42 15552 1.82 0.586 0.713  Junior Middle School 1955 28.18 22127 1.27 0.521 0.495  High School or Technical  Secondary School 1886 27.19 26495 1.149 0.463 0.392  Junior College 875 12.61 29160 0.85 0.406 0.282  University 1325 19.1 36942 1.087 0.418 0.334  Graduate 173 2.49 41067 1.221 0.458 0.416 Note: The gender, age, education level in Tab.1 represent the householders? gender, age, education level of every respondent?s  family.

- 1078 -   1.204, 0.487, 0.435 and 0.940,0.453,0.351 respectively, showing that Minority residents? income gap is lower than Han residents?.

Inspecting from the age differences, the relationship between the householders? age and per capita annual income presents inverted "U" shaped. Specifically, as the householders aged 16-30 years to 60 years or more, the per capita annual income of family rises from 27915 yuan at 16-30 years old to the highest point of 28909 yuan at the age of 31-40, subsequently falls to 11174 yuan over the age of 60. The per capita annual income of householders aged 31-40 is 2.59 times than that of householders over the age of 60 (see Tab.1). The inverted "U" shaped relationship between householders? age and per capita annual income means the seriousness of the imperfection of pension and social security. While in the point of the income gap indicators, residents? income gap of householders aged 51-60 (Gini coefficient of 0.519) is the largest.

Viewing from the education level differences, as the upgrading of the householders? education level, annual per capita household income shows a significant upward trend, that is per capita household income and the education level of the householders are positively correlated. As the education level of householders improved from primary to graduate, per capita annual income of family rises from 15552 yuan to 41067 yuan.

The per capita annual income of the householders owning a graduate education level is 2.64 times than that of the householders only possessing primary education or less. While in the point of the income gap indicators, the relationship between the householders? education level and per capita annual income presents inverted "U" shaped, as the education level upgraded from primary to graduate, the Gini coefficient drops to the bottom point of 0.406 from the highest point of 0.586, and then increased to 0.458(see Tab.1) again.

4 Analysis on the determinants of Chinese residents? income  4.1 Variables selection and model construction  In order to analyze the effect of different characteristics, individual human capital, dual structure of the rural-urban division and different regions on income gap of residents, this paper extends the Mincer(1974) income equation, multiple regression equations constructed as follows:  0 1 2 3 4  5 6 7 1 8 2  ln e e  y male han age age pop edu r g r g  ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?  = + + + + + + + +  (4)    0 1 2 3 4 5 2  5 5 10 1 1  ln  i i i i i i  y male han age age  pop edu reg  ? ? ? ? ?  ? ? ?+ + = =  = + + + +  + + +? ? (5)  Among them, lny is a logarithmic form of family annual income, is dependent variables, 0?  is constant term, i?  is regression coefficient, the explanatory variables are divided into basic characteristics (gender, age, nationality, personal), human capital (education, culture degree), institutional factors (dual structure of the rural-urban division), regional differences, ?  as the random error term. The definitions of variables are shown in table 2.

Gender, nation, cultural degree is used to analyze the impact of income gender, nation differences, and human capital in the model. Use age as a proxy for work experience with the age square to illustrate the income changes with age. In order to illustrate the impact of dual structure of rural-urban and regions difference on income distribution, we set representation of virtual variables.

4.2 Measurement result analysis  According to the econometric model (4) (5), using questionnaire data with econometric analysis software  Tab.2 All variables in the model (dependent variables is the logarithmic of household per capita income lny)  Explanatory variables Symbol Meaning  Basic characteristics of personal and family  Gender (dummy variable) male male =1 Nation (dummy variable) han han=1 Age age Age square age2 Family population pop  Human capital  Years of Education edu  Degree of culturea (dummy variable) edui  Junior middle school edu1=1 High school or technical secondary school edu2=1 Junior College edu3=1 University edu4=1 Graduate edu5=1  Difference between urban and rural  areas  Urban and ruralb (dummy variable) urb Urban residents urb=1  Regional differences Regions(dummy variable) geoi Eastern region geo1=1 Middle region geo2=1  Note: Reference: a-primary school and below; b-rural residents; c-western region.

- 1079 -   EViews6.0, we have regression results shown in Tab.3.

In Tab.3, model 1, model 2-1, model 2-2, model 3 and model 4, which reflect the impact of basic characteristics, the individual human capital (education, culture degree), institutional factors(dual structure of rural-urban) and regional differences on the family annual income. The regression coefficients of all variables have the expected sign, the variables all have higher statistical significance, and the regression equation of the goodness of fit is high after eliminating heteroscedasticity. In addition, the influencing factors can explain the family annual per capita income in more than 99%, the results are satisfactory.

4.2.1 Analysis based on the results of regression  (1)Effects of basic characteristics of the personal on annual income of the family  Model 1 results show that the basic characteristic of the individual has a significant impact on the average annual family income. In the other factors remain unchanged, the male head of the household income is 10.52%? higher than that of the female head. In our country, gender discrimination has been watered down, but we can not ignore the impact on residents? income.

The physiological differences between men and women and traditional concepts are difficult to eradicate, explicit discrimination has weakened, but the invisible discrimination is still widespread. Annual per capita income of Chinese households is 62.58% higher than that of minority residents, which may be related to ethnic minorities living in remote areas. The coefficient of age to lny is 0.0152, square coefficient is -0.0002, shows that with each additional year of work experience, income increases 1.53%. Effect of age on the income of residents has obvious nonlinear effect showing a clear inverted "U" type relationship, this shows that along with the increase of the age, the income has a diminishing marginal effect. Family size and annual per capita income of family shows a significant negative correlation, namely increasing per person, per capita family income decreased by 23.19%. Overall, the national feature owns the highest rate of income, followed by family size and age feature owns the minimum rate among the basic characteristics of the individual.

(2)Effect of human capital on the annual income of the family  The unbalanced development of education has become an important factor in further widening income gap. There is significant difference effect of educational factor on income level in different regions, urban and rural, unit, and family. In order to verify the judgment of importance of the human capital deciding income, we conduct quantitative analysis of income gap caused by the difference of human capital in our country.

Model 2-1 in Tab.3 shows that, years of education has a significant positive effect on the annual per capita   ? Note: the regression coefficient ?, for log-linear models, the influence degree of explanatory variables to dependent variables is(e?-1) ? 100%, hereinafter the same.

income of family, the education years for every increase of 1 year, the average annual family income will increase 9.31%. In order to compare different culture degrees impacting family income, we take primary school and below as reference, using culture degree dummy variables instead of education years. The results are shown in Tab.3 model 2-2. The result shows that the average annual family income gradually increases with schooling increases. Person with higher level of education owns higher production capacity and configuration ability, as its reinforced mechanism, the ability to earn income will be further enhanced.

Specifically, the family income of householders with junior middle school, high school or technical secondary school, junior College, university, and graduate education are 54.70%, 96.56%, 130.48%, 186.42%, 200.51% higher than primary school and below respectively.

In human capital theory, with the cultural level increase, the individual rate of return to education has increased significantly, and the increasing rate is rising.

By the regression results we can draw a consistent conclusion, higher education income rate is higher than that of secondary education and elementary education, and the difference becomes larger and larger. This indicates that the income gap between the university or above education group and other education groups appeared a widening trend. Therefore, years of schooling and education have become increasingly important influence factors on income of our country dweller and income gap. Cultural degree increase the rate of return reflecting China?s income distribution system reformation led to increase in knowledge gains from the side, but also reflects the society emphasis of knowledge education on the increase.

(3)Effect of institutional factors (dual structure of rural-urban) on the annual income of the family  Model 3 in Tab.3 shows that institutional factors (dual structure of rural-urban) have a significant effect on the average annual family income, the income of urban residents is 78.09% higher than that of rural residents.

Continuing expanding the level of per capita income gap between urban and rural residents in China is an important cause of widening income gap of residents.

However the gap between urban and rural areas is largely caused by the institutional and policy factors, such as income distribution system, social security system and the household registration system, etc.. The most prominent manifestation of China?s social inequality is the dual social structure of rural-urban. The urban-rural system divides the 1.3 billion population into two social groups of inequality. With the rapid development of the technology progress and economy, the marginal productivity of urban residents increased determines the corresponding rising of income level. However, simple agricultural production occupies the main position in the rural areas, and the existence of a large number of rural surplus labor as well as the limited agricultural resources determines the rural low-income residents.

(4)Effect of regional differences on the annual  income of the family Model 4 in Tab.3 show that regional differences  have a significant impact on the annual per capita income of households. Specifically, the family annual per capita income of eastern and middle region are 84.97%, 1.47% higher than the western region residents. This illustrates that the eastern region of the residents? income is significantly higher than that of central and western regions, regional economic development level still have obvious influence on the income level of residents.The income gap caused by geographical differences rooted in the imbalance of regional economic development. The economic bases, urbanization rate, residents? education opportunities, natural conditions of agricultural production, all of them are better than that of middle and western region. On the other hand, since the reform and opening up, the income gap is exacerbated by the expansion of the difference to the economy advancing from east to west sequence and regional imbalance development strategy taken by China.

5 Statistical analysis of questionnaire survey on Chinese residents? income gap mode- ration  5.1 Basic judgment of the moderation of residents? income gap at this stage  As the basic judgment of the moderation of residents? income gap at this stage, looking at the result from a national questionnaire survey statistics, the prop- ortion of respondents choosing the "residents? income  gap is not moderate" (value 1) is 33.16%, selecting the "basic moderate" (value 3) is 33.55%, choosing "very modest" (value 5) is 1.28%, the ratio selecting "between very not moderate and basic moderate" (value 2), " between basically moderate and very modest" (value 4) are 28.4% and 3.61% respectively (see Fig.1). This suggests that, for the basic judgment of the moderation of residents? income gap at this stage, more than 60% of the residents deem it has exceeded reasonable limits, the result reflects the harsh reality that residents? income gap in our country is too large at this stage.

Moderate income gap will help improve the enthu- siasm of workers and promote economic growth, enha- nce the efficiency of resource allocation. The inappr- opriate residents? income gap is unfavorable. Therefore, residents? income gap moderation is defined as: in a certain period of time, the residents? income gap is compatible with the economic and social development, not only helps promote economic growth, improves the efficiency of resource allocation, but also helps to prom- ote a fair distribution of income and social stability. [21] Based on 6937 urban and rural questionnaires in 31 provinces across the country, this essay analyzes and evaluates the hot issues of public concern to the moderate-related residents? income gap.

5.2 Main reasons for the widening residents? income gap  Looking at the result from a national questionnaire survey statistics, the main reasons for the widening residents? income gap, the proportions of respondents choosing "bit of money, rent-seeking and corruption",    - 1081 -     33.16%  28.40%  33.55%  1.28%3.61%  1 2 3 4 5   Note: 1 represents ?not moderate?, 3 represents ?moderate?, 5 represents ?very modest?  Fig.1 Basic judgment of the moderation of residents? income gap at this stage   "imperfection of social security system", "trade monopoly", "inequality of individual opportunity" and "the policies and measurements to improve the condition of fair allocation not good enough" are 56.06%, 47.29%, 45.85%, 43.97% and 41.76% respectively, rounding out of the top 5. While the proportions are relatively low that these respondents choosing "differences in individual ability", "dual structure of the rural-urban division", "inadequate supply of public goods and the uneven distribution", and "unfair tax burden", the proportions of them are 39.68%, 36.05%,23.28% and 21.08% successively, ranking in 6 to 9(see Fig.2). This result illustrates that "bit of money, rent-seeking and corruption", "imperfection of social security system" and "trade monopoly" are the main reasons for the widening residents? income gap at present.

The proportion of respondents choosing "between can not bear and generally can bear" (value of 2), "between generally can bear and can bear" (value 4) are 34.47% and 3.03% respectively. The result demonstrates that more than 50% of the residents can withstand the widening income gap currently.

Fig.3 Endurance of the public residents to the widening income gap at this stage   5.4 Public satisfaction of the income distribution at present  Inspecting from the result of the national questionnaire survey statistics (see Fig.4), for the satisfaction of the income distribution, the proportions of respondents choosing "very dissatisfied" (value of 1),"general" (value 3) and "very satisfied" (value 5) are 25.25%, 38.29% and 1.24% respectively. And the ratios of selecting "ranged from very dissatisfied to general" (value 2), "general to very satisfied" (value 4) are 30.81% and 4.21% by order. The result illustrates that more than 55% of the residents are not satisfied with the income distribution presently, while the residents expressed satisfaction are in the minority, that is our country public?s dissatisfaction on income distribution situation is greater than satisfaction.

However, "decline of policy prestige", "slowdown of the pace of economic development" and "frequent occurrence of social group behavior" rank at 4, 5 and 6, the proportions of these options are accounted for 56.87%, 39.79% and 37.51% (see Fig.5). Therefore, more than half of respondents believe that "increase in the degree of social instability", "the rise of public discontent" and "aggravation of social differentiation" are the most    - 1082 -   important consequences resulting from the income distribution inequity exacerbation.

And the proportions of selecting "employment discrimination", "the household registration system" are 39.01% and 38.52% respectively, ranking 4 and 5 in turn (see Fig.6). Hence, more than half of the respondents hold the view that "education", "social security" and "public infrastructure" are the main features of unfairness of rural residents. This implies that the matter of unfairness of educational resources distribution needs to be resolved as soon as possible; only in this way can we make contribution to solve the income gap between urban and rural areas. Secondly, we should pay sufficient attention to social security and public infrastructure. As the results above consistent with the situation of our country, the factors of social security imperfect coverage, backwardness of public infrastructure in rural areas are still the causes of the income gap between urban and rural areas which can not be ignored.

The result manifests that vast majority of our public repute the relationship between efficiency and equity in the initial distribution and redistribution should be handled properly, with particular emphasis on equity in redistribution.

And the options of "inflation" (48.84%), "poverty status" (47.50%) and "public security" (43.03%) come in 4-6 (see Fig.8). Thus, most residents believe that the "polarization", "corruption" and "unemployment" are the main factors affecting social stability.

The survey results indicate that, the vast majority of residents believe that the "too large    - 1083 -   wealth gap" is the main risk in blocking efficiency.

However, other options such as "establish a mechanism for regular pay increases", "gain efforts to narrow the income gap between urban and rural residents", "eliminate monopoly, establish a fair competitive market environment", "guarantee the equality of the starting point and opportunity" and "improve the level of public goods distribution and the balance of allocation" rank 4 to 8 with the ratios of 52.75%, 52.24%, 45.61%, 43.60% and 34.22% respectively (see Fig.10). Thus, more than half of the residents consider that the policy focus of promoting fair distribution are "ban illegal incomes, punish corruption", "improve the social security system, gain efforts to help low-income groups" and "improve the tax system, give full play to the tax adjustment function".

6 Conclusions and policy implications   Based on the 9663 questionnaires survey data by residents from 31 provinces of China, the paper does an appraisal on the current situation of residential income gap in China. A statistic analysis and evaluation is conducted on the basic judgment for the appropriateness of residents? income gap at the present stage, main reasons and the public endurance for the enlarging of the gap, the public satisfaction for income distribution situation, the potential consequences for the aggravated unfair income distribution, the current relations between  the fairness and efficiency, the most important way for the distribution fairness, the main manifestations of rural residents? unfairness, the major factors and risks affecting social stability and economic efficiency and the key policy to promote fair distribution. The following are the research conclusions and its related policy implications.

6.1 Research conclusions  Conclusion 1 The income gap of our residents is large, and Gini coefficient has exceeded the cordon.

Because of the differences on disparities among regions, urban and rural areas, the householders? essential features and the human capital, there are greater differences on the average income of residents? family and the income gap. The results of questionnaire survey indicate that the average per capita income of the urban family is higher than that of rural residents, while the rural residents? income gap is higher than that of urban residents; the average per capita income of family and the income inequality in eastern China are higher than those in central and western China; the average per capita income of the Han family and the income gap are higher than that of the family of ethnic minority; the average per capita income in the families headed by males and the income gap are higher than that of the families headed by females. The relationship between the age of householder and the family?s average per capital income presents an inverted U-shape, which is smaller on two sides and larger on middle, besides, the residents? income gap between 51 and 60 years old is the largest. From the perspective of educational background, there are positive correlations between the average family income and the educational background of the house- holders. Also there is an inverted U-shape relationship between the educational background of the householders and the average family income gap.

Conclusion 2 The current income gap of residents surpasses rational limit. The result of questionnaire survey shows that 60% of the residents think that the current income gap of residents has surpassed rational limit.

Conclusion 3 "The transactions between power and money, rent-seeking and corruption" is the main cause of the enlarging of residents? income gap at present. The questionnaire research has revealed that"transactions between power, money, rent-seeking and corruption", "the imperfect social insurance system",  67.69%  45.61%  53.71%  52.24%  34.22%  65.53%  43.60%  52.75%  0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80%  Ban illegal incomes, punish corruption  Eliminate monopoly, establish a fair competitive market environment  Improve the tax system, give full play to the tax adjustment function  Gain efforts to narrow the income gap between urban and rural residents  Improve the level of public goods distribution and the balance of allocation  Improve the social security system, gain efforts to help low-income groups  Guarantee the equality of the starting point and opportunity  Establish a mechanism for regular pay increases   Fig.10 Policy focus on promoting fair distribution    - 1084 -   "unfair opportunity of the individual", "trade monopoly" and "the invalid policies and measures to improve the situation of fair distribution" are the most important reasons for the current enlarging of residents? income gap. These are the first five reasons selected by respondents, while other reasons are less selected.

Conclusion 4 Residents? endurance to the widening of income gap is stronger, but most residents are not satisfied with the current income distribution situation. The outcome of questionnaire survey reveals that more than 50% residents think that they can endure the lagering of income gap at present.

Whereas, more than 50% of them are not satisfied with the current income distribution situation.

Conclusion 5 "The increasing society instability" is potentially the main consequence resulted from the aggravated unfairness of income distribution; "official corruption" and "big gap between rich and poor" are the major factors and risks affecting social stability and economic efficiency. The results of questionnaire survey indicate that over a half residents think that "the increasing of social stability", "the growing of public?s dissatisfaction", "the intensifying of social differentiation" and " the dropping of policy prestige" are the top 4 potential consequences for the aggravated unfairness of income distribution, while few of them chose the result of "the slowing of economic development speed" and " the frequent social crowd acting".

According to the result of the questionnaire survey, more than a half respondents choose "polarization of wealth", "official corruption" and "unemployment conditions" as the first three main factors affecting the social stability at present; few of them choose the factors of "currency inflation", "state of poverty" and "security of society".

Conclusion 6  "The relationship between equity and efficiency should be balanced both in the primary distribution and redistribution, and more emphasis should be put on equity in redistribution"; compared with the urban residents, the inequity for the rural residents mainly manifests in "education", "social security", and "public infrastructure service". As to the current relationship between equity and efficiency, most respondents agree that "the relationship between equity and efficiency should be balanced both in the primary distribution and redistribution, and more emphasis should be put on equity in redistribution". In general, the majority of residents point out that the "cake" should not only be made bigger but distributed well. In contrast, people pay more attention on equity than efficiency. The result of questionnaire survey shows that more than 50% residents think that compared with the urban residents, the inequity for the rural residents mainly manifests in "education", "social security" and "public infrastructure service", and few of them choose " household system" and "employment discrimination".

Conclusion 7 "Banning illegal and abnormal income, and punishing the corruption" is the most  important measure to improve fair distribution and narrow the income gap. The outcome of questionnaire survey reveals that over half of the respondents consider "banning illegal and abnormal income, and punishing the corruption", "building up a perfect social security system, and strengthening the support for low income group" and "perfecting the tax system, giving the full play to the adjusting role of tax" as the leading three policies to promote fair distribution. However, few respondents choose the policies of "establishing the normal growth mechanism of the wages", "trying to narrow down the income disparity between urban and rural residents", "eliminating the monopoly, establishing market environment with fair competition", "ensuring the fairness of the starting point and the equity of opportunity" and " improving the supply level of public goods and the proportionality of distribution", which are ranked behind the former three policies.

6.2 Policy implications  (1) Expand the cake and well distribute it, keep paying attention on efficiency and maintain the fairness.

The result of questionnaire survey indicates that the income gap of our residents is large, and Gini coefficient has exceeded the cordon; for the relationship between equity and efficiency, most residents hope that it should be well handled both in the primary distribution and redistribution, and more emphasis should be put on equity in redistribution. The "cake" should be expanded and well distributed at the same time; while the "cake" is well distributed, it should be made bigger and better.[22] Because of the stages of economic development, it requires different policy choice orientations towards equity and efficiency. In the early stages of economic development, the distributable cake is small due to the small scale economy, so the cake should be made bigger firstly, and then it can come to be distributed. The bigger the cake, the more people will be distributed. When the economy develops into a considerable level, the distributable cake has formed a considerable scales and a certain distribution pattern which leads to the unfairness of income distribution has been established, the adjustment of distribution structure becomes more important. With the development of more than 30 years, the economy grows increasingly, and the residents? income level and living quality has improved obviously, our country has fallen in a crucial stage of constructing a well-being society. Currently, there still exits some urgent and troublesome issues in income distribution, namely, the development of urban-rural area is still in biggish gap, the issue of substandard income distribution order, invisible income and illegal income is obvious[23].

In this case, the expanding and the distribution of the cake should be taken in harmony. The enthusiasm of the workers to make a bigger cake should be stimulated and the cake should be properly distributed around the people?s livelihood so as to realize the social fairness and harmonious development. Whether to expand or to well distribute the cake, its ultimate goal lies in that the    - 1085 -   people enjoy together all the development achievements.

The inherent requirement for the construction of socialistic harmonious society is that more attention should be paid to fairness on the basis of economy development and efficiency improvement.

(2) Ban illegal and abnormal income, eliminate the rent-seeking and punish the corruption, regulate the gray income to promote the income information open and transparent. The result of questionnaire survey indicates that "the transactions between power and money, rent-seeking and corruption" has become the main cause of the enlarging of resident?s income gap in most people?s heart at present. "Banning illegal and abnormal income and punishing the corruption" is the leading policy for the promotion of fair distribution. Therefore, to ban illegal and abnormal income, eliminate the rent-seeking and punish the corruption resolutely is the key link for the regulation of income distribution. People are not satisfied with the enlarging of income gap; as a matter of fact, they are mainly not satisfied with the huge wealth obtained by illegal and irregular act. Hence, all kinds of illegal income should be severely punished; the hole of the reform of state-owned enterprise, Land Grant System and exploitation of mineral resources should be plugged; commerce bribery should be deeply governed.

The illegal activities, like power rent-seeking, collusion between government officials and businessmen, corruption, smuggling, insider transactions, manipulation of stock market, manufacturing and selling fakes, fraud of loan and foreign exchange, should be severely attacked.

The definition of political rights and market power should be clear. The expansion and abuse of the political rights should be prevented in order to maintain the market fairness, try to drop out the political rights out primary distribution. It is necessary to further regulate the gray income, such as cash gifts, red envelopes, appearance fees, favor fees and all kinds of welfare, cut off the channels of gray income. Open and transparent income information is the premise to strengthen supervision and promote fair distribution. The establishment of the data- base for income information should be accelerated, including the citizen?s personal data, income, property, housing, and so on. The system of individual payment and settlement should be built, advance the settlement system of resident?s fixed account credit card and check, promote computerized transactions. To boost the open- ness and transparence of income information, the super- vision functions of the public and press needs to work effectively and the resident?s right to be informed should be respected. If one?s income and family burden is trans- parent, the gray and illegal income will hide nowhere and tax evasion will lost space.[24]  (3) Break up the dual-structures, and promote regional, urban and rural economy coordination development. The outcome of questionnaire survey reveals that the average per capita income of the urban family is higher than that of rural family, while the rural  residents? income gap is higher than that of urban residents; the average per capita income of family in eastern China is higher than that in central and western China. The economic discrepancy between rural and urban areas, region is obvious, because the market role in allocation of resources between rural and urban areas, particularly among regions is restricted by the dual economic structure, and the resources concentrate on large and medium-sized city or developed area. To narrow the income gap, firstly, it needs to reduce the restriction for the population flow by household system, try to eliminate its barrier and all kinds of obstacles for the labor mobility, let the manpower flow freely between rural and urban areas, and regions, offer equal employment opportunity for the urban-rural population and make the rural-workers normally enjoy the public service of city?s education and medical treatment. On one hand, it can improve the rural residents? income, overall plan the resources between urban and rural areas; on the other hand, it is helpful for the transfer of rural surplus labor force and the reasonable flow of human resources between urban and rural areas. Secondly, great efforts should be taken to construct the rural infrastructure and narrow down its gap with urban areas. The rural infrastructure tends to be underdeveloped, and it is not only difficult to solve the problem by depending on market but impossible by relying on its own accumulation. Therefore, to improve the income of rural residents and narrow the income gap between urban and rural areas, it is necessary to strengthen the infrastructure construction in poor rural areas and to promote the equalization of their infrastructure and basic public service. Thirdly, the transfer from agricultural labor to nonagricultural one should be facilitated, more employment opportunities, nonagricultural ones in particular, should be offered to the rural surplus labor force in order to improve the farmer?s nonagricultural income. Meanwhile, the government can encourage the urban enterprise to employ the rural residents by the policies of tax preference and finance so that the income of rural residents will increase in a large scale and the income gap between rural and urban areas will narrow down.

The key point to solve the issue of regional income disparities is to harmonize the regional economic development, give full play to their comparative advantages and form the pattern of complementary advantage, mutual promotion and development. The government should strengthen the policy support for underdeveloped areas, realize the rational gradient transfer from developed areas to less developed areas by the necessary transfer payment and industry guide, lead the capital and talents to flow to less developed area so as to raise its economic development level, increase the resident?s income and narrow the income gap between residents in developed areas.

Meanwhile, it needs to increase the policy support for remote areas and minority areas, try to reduce the basic condition disparities of the development of    - 1086 -   economic society in these areas, promote their own competitiveness so as to achieve the goal of narrowing the income gap.[25]  (4) Strengthen the help system for low income group and vulnerable groups, ensure every worker?s rights and interests to participate in the economic activities fairly, establish perfect minimum living standard security system for the poor population and medical aid system. Result of research indicates that the average per capita income and the income gap in the families headed by males are higher than that of the families headed by females. With the advance of marketization, labor force production factor is strongly influenced by survival of the fittest in market. Male worker has more advantages than female worker in market competition and his degree of participation is higher, so his income must increase more than the female worker and it leads to the enlarging of income inequality.

At present, the government has carried out many definite regulations on the protection of employment equity for women and vulnerable groups, and the work focuses on further perfecting these policy measures and paying more attention on supervision, make sure that each system is really implemented and every worker has the right and interests to participate in the business activities fairly.

The outcome of questionnaire reveals that more than 60% of the respondents select "perfect the social security system, and strengthen the help system for low income group" as the key policy to promote fair distribution. It fully proves that the system of social security and social assistance plays an important role in the adjustment of resident?s income distribution.

Currently, the poor population, rural poor population in particular, mainly concentrate on the areas with poor geographical environment, remote areas, minority areas, old liberated areas and remote mountain areas. The population quality in these areas is not high, the opportunity and ability to shake of poverty and obtain development is limited, so it is necessary for the government to innovate continually in helping the poor and find a new way. The government should increase financial input for the poor areas and poor population, strengthen the help system for low income groups and vulnerable groups, establish perfect minimum living standard security system for the poor population and medical aid system, reduce the incidence rates of poverty, make low income groups and vulnerable groups share the achievements of economic developments. With the increasing growth of economy, the social security system enjoyed by the whole society with different regions, ages, genders and occupations should be gradually established.

While the government attaches the importance on the work of living assistance, it should strengthen the poverty-relief and the development, take more effective measures, improve their self- developing ability, change the support for poverty from transfusion to creation, develop production according to the local conditions, foster and enlarge the advantage industry and characteristic economy in poor areas, strengthen the  hematopoiesis functions increasingly, improve their ability of self-accumulation and self-development, speed up the steps to eliminate poverty.

(5) Complete the tax system, intensify taxation supervision and regulate the excessively high income.

The result of questionnaire survey indicates that more than half of the respondents consider "perfecting the tax system and giving full play to the adjustment function of fax" as the crucial policy to promote fair distribution. It fully shows that the taxation plays a critical role in the adjustment of residents? income distribution. In our country, the redistribution function of tax should be further enhanced. However, there exist many problems in our country?s tax system. The tax system of individual income, consumption and property is not perfect. Besides, the inheritance tax, gift tax and social security tax have not been levied yet. In addition, the individual income tax is levied by classification, the management system is incomplete and supervision is poor. Because of these, the function of tax to adjust the distribution of income is weakened. Thus, to give full play to the tax function of adjusting the distribution of income, it is necessary to build and perfect the tax system and management system which are beneficial for the adjustment of the distribution of income. The individual income tax should be adjusted reasonably and timely in line with the change of residents? wages, price of commodities, basic living costs etc. The government should pay more attention on the tax levying and regulation, severely punish the behavior of tax evasion. The management and supervision of tax from monopolized industry and high income people should be well done in particular for the effective adjustment of the excessively high income. As for the regulation of high income, the method of individual income tax should be used and overseas experiences should also be borrowed. The inheritance tax, gift tax, social security tax and the special consumption tax should be levied earlier for the regulation.

(6) Develop education greatly, intensify the equity of education opportunity, enhance the workers? skill and level of human capital. The outcome of questionnaire reveals that the higher education level is, the more the average family income will be; there is an inverted U-shape relationship between the educational income gap; the higher education level is, the stronger the endurance to the widening of income gap will be and the more satisfied people are with the income distribution situation. It proves that education, as the important resources for human capital, plays an increasingly important role in the promotion of economic development, and the increase of knowledge yield is well reflected in the reform of income distribution system.

Because of the dual labor market, the labor force with lower education mainly work in the traditional labor market and the supply of labor force exceeds demand due to the lack of skill. The fierce market competition leads to the low income of the labor force.[26] The modern labor market requires skilled labor force, so the labor force with higher education mainly work here and their    - 1087 -   income is also higher. Besides, the demand of labor force exceeds the supply or they are in balance. The important measures to narrow the income gap are the following: intensify the equity of education opportunity; increase the input of public expenditure on education; add the investment of human capital further, especially for the low income groups so as to offer equal education opportunity to every worker. Therefore, the government should expand the expenditure in education, especial in the areas of less developed, poverty and minority so that residents in these areas will enjoy the same education.

Education will enhance the workers? quality and skills, increase the knowledge content and creativity of labor and raise the income. To satisfy the demand of increasingly trans- forming the way of economic development and adjusting economy structure, vocational education, skill training and further education should be paid more attention to improve the labor?s quality and skill. It is beneficial to promote labor factor fluxion in market, overcome structural unemployment, increase the labor?s income and narrow the income gap.
