Cognitive Diversity in Perceptive Informatics and Affective Computing

ABSTRACT  The advent of sensor technologies and imaging  modalities has greatly increased our abilit y to map  the brain structure and understand its cognitive function.

In order for the acquired Big Data (with large volume, wide variety, and high velocity) to be valuable, innovative  data-centric algorithms and systems in machine learning,  data mining and artificial in telligence have been  developed, designed and implemented. Due t 0 the  complexity of the brain system and its co gnitive  processes, new data-driven paradigm is needed to recognize patterns in Big Data, to fuse information from  different sources (systems and se nsors), and to extract  useful knowledge for actionable decisions.

In this talk, I will focus on the notion of "Cognition  diversity" which provides a new paradigm to measure the "dissimilarity" or "difference", between two objects or  subjects at both the levels of variable (feature, cue,  parameter, modality, indicator) and system  (classification, regression, associate rule and cluste ring;  decision trees, naIve Bayes, k-NN, neural nets, SVM and  other kernel methods). We compare cognitive diversity to  the three statistical co rrelations (Pearson, Kendall and  Spearman). We also discuss the relation of cognitive  diversity to other goodness-of-fit tests ( e.g. the  Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). It can be emphasized that  cognitive diversity is u seful in unsupervised machine  learning and decision making environments where the  true fact or optimal decision is not known or cannot be  obtained until it happens.

Among other applications, we discuss three  examples: (1) com bining two visual perception and  cognition systems using confidence radius and cognitive  diversity, (2) feature selection and combination for stress  detection and affectiv e computing using ph ysiological sensors, and (3) combinatorial fusion of five sensor stress  detection algorithms: C4.5, NaIve Bayes (N B), Linear  Discriminate Function (LDF), SVM and K-nearest  neighbors (k-NN) across a variety of feat ure sets selected by C4.5, PC A, correlation-based and  diversity-based feature and selection methods.
