In order to be reliable in a decision making process, such discovered rules have to be concise and easily understandable for users or as well as an input to visualization tools. In this paper, we present a 3D Histograms -based visualization prototype for handling generic bases of association rules. An interesting feature of the prototjpe is that it provides a '*contextual" exploration of such rule set. Such additional displayed knowledge, based on the construction of fuzzy meta-rules. enhances man-machine interaction by emulating a cooperative behavior.

I .  INTRODLJCTION With wide applications of computers and automated data collection tools, massive amounts of data have been contin- uously collected and stored in databases, which creates an imminent need and great opportunities for mining interesting knowledge from data. Association rule mining is one kind of data mining techniques which discovers strong association or correlation relationships among data. Much research in data mining from large databases has focused on the discovery of association rules [I], [ 2 ] .  Association rule generation is achieved from a set F of frequent itemsets in an extraction context D, for a minimal support minsupp. An association rule r is a relation between itemsets of the form I' : X 9 (Y - X ) .  in which S and Y are frequent itemsets. and X E I-. itemsets X and (Y - X) are called, respectively, antecedent and conclusion of the rule r. The valid association rules are those of which the measure of confidence Conflr)= support(Y)  1 .

The problem of the relevance and usefulness of extracted association mles is of primary importance. Indeed, in most real life databases, thousands and even millions of high-confidence rulcs are generated among which many are redundant. This problem encouraged the development of tools for rule clas- sification according to their properties, for rule selection according to user-defined criteria. and for rule visualization.

E-mail: mephu@cril.univ-artois.fr Various techniques are used to limit thc number of re- ported rules, starting by basic pruning techniques based on thresholds for both the frequency of the represented pattcm and the strength of the dependency between antecedent and conclusion. This pruning can be based on patterns defined by the user (user-d&amp;ned templates), on boolean operators [3], [4], [5]. The number of rules can be reduced through pruning based on additional information such as a taxonomy on items [6] or a metric of specific interest [7] (e.g., Pearson's correlation or k2-test).

More advanced techniques that produce only a limited  number of the entire set of rules rely on closures and Galois connections [8], which arc in turn derived from Galois lattice theory and formal concept analysis (FCA) [ O ] .  Finally, works on FCA have yielded a row of results on compact representa- tions of closed set families, also called buses, whose impact on association rule reduction is currently under intensive    on association rule reduction is currently under intensive investigation within the community [8].

Visualization tools allow users to work in an interactive en- vironment with ease in understanding rules. In a based-tabular view of association rules, all strong rules are represented in a tabular rcprcsentation format (rule table), in which each entry corresponding to a rule. Ail rules can be displayed in difkrent order, such as ordcr by antecedent, conclusion, support or confidence. This helps users to have a clearer view of the rules and locates a particular rule more easily. The tabular view is very suitable for representing large number of rules with varied length, and easily understood. As a drawback, tabular-based technique draws heavily on "boring" logical inference that a user should perform, and is not suitable for visualizing rules from different aspects. For example, if a user is interested in a comprehensive view of the relationship between rules and items. In this case, the tabular view is not very convenient, since an item is repetitively appeared in the rule table as long as it i s  contained by a rule. These facts underline the importance of graphical rules visualization tools, permitting a more clear and vivid view of the rules and items. Indeed, visual representation have the capability of shifting load from the user's cognitive system to the perceptual system [ l O l .

However, as pointed out in the dedicated literature, the 3D Histograms-based technique is actually interesting if only a small size of rules are handled.

Wc find that a 3D histograms-bascd technique is particularly well suited for visualizing such (non-redundant) bascs of association rulcs. Indeed, their sizes is by far lower than the set of all (redundant) association rules. An interesting feature of the aforementioned prototype is that it provides a "contextual" exploration of such rule set. For example. if a user selects a given rule, then all the "connected" rules are displayed to the user in  an interactive manner. The contextual interaction is performed through the construction of  fuzzy meta-rules, i.e.. rules where both premises and conclusions arc composed of rulcs. It is noteworthy that, such additional displayed knowledge allows an iinprovemcnt man-machinc intcraction by emulating a cooperative behavior, as depicted by Figure 1.

Section 2 sketches briefly the mathematical background for the extrac- tion of generic bases of association rules. After a review of the related work, in Section 3 we present the process of the extraction of fizzy association meta-rules. Then we discuss i n depth in Section 4 the opportunity of the rule set contextual cxploration. Section 5 concludes this paper and points out future research directions.

11. EXTRACTING ENERIC BASES OF ASSOCIATION RULES In the following, we recall some key results from the Galois lattice-based paradigm in FCA and its applications to association rules mining. A formal context is a hiplet R = (O .A:R) ,  where 0 rcprcsents a finitc set of objects (or transactions), A is a finite sct of attributcs and R is a binary relation (i.e., R C D x 7). Each couple (..a) E R cxprcsscs that thc transaction o E 0 contains the attribute U E A. We definc two functions that map sets of objects to sets of attributes and vice versa. Thus, for a set 0 0. we define 4(0) = { ( I  I Yo. o E 0 +- (0, a )  E 72): and for 4 A, $ ( A )  = {o I Vn, n E A + (o, a )  E R}. Both functions p and tl? form a Galois connection between the respective power sets P(d) and P(0) [ 1 11. Consequently, both compound operators of Q and y; arc closure operators, in particular i~ = Q o 4) is a    of Q and y; arc closure operators, in particular i~ = Q o 4) is a closure.

Frequent closed itemset: An itemset A A is said to be closed if A = ,.(A), and is said to bcfiequent with respect to ininsup threshold if .support(A) = 2 minsiip. An itemset 9 C A is called ntiaitnal genemtor of a closed itemset A. if and only if~)(sg) = A and $g' g such that U)($') = A.

Iceberg Galois lattice: When only frcqucnt closed itemsets are considered with set inclusion, the resulting structure ( L  G) only preserves the joint operator. In the remaining of the paper, such structure is referred to "Iceberg Galois Lattice".

[13], given an Iceberg Galois lattice, representing prcccdence-relation-based ordercd closcd itemsets, generic bases of association rules can be dcrivcd in a straightforward manner. We assume that in such structure. each closed itemsct is "decorated" with its associatcd list of minimal generators. Hence, A R represent "inter-node" implications, assorted with a statistical information, i.e.. the confidence.

from a sub-closed-itemset to a super-closed-itemset while starting from a given node in an ordered structure. Inversely, ER are "intra-node" implications extracted from each node in the ordered structure. Once these generic bases were obtained.

all the remaining (redundant) rules can bc derived easily.

Indccd. to do so it is sufficient to augmcnt a generic rule's antecedent by an itcm of thc same rule's conclusion.

For example, let us consider the transaction database given by Table I (Left). The set of extracted closed itemsets, with their associated minimal generators, is depicted by Ta- ble I (Right). Therefore. Table 11 yields, respectively. the extracted ER and AR that it may be possible to derive for minsup=l .
