Designing and Implementing Multibeam Smart Antennas  for High Bandwidth VA V Communications using FPGAs

Abstract- Requirements for high bandwidth UAV communications are often necessary in order to move  large amounts of mission information to/from Users in  real-time. The focus of this paper is antenna  beamforming for point-to-point, high bandwidth UA V  communications in order to optimize transmit and  receive power and support high data throughput  communications. Specifically, this paper looks at the  design and implementation of MuItibeam Smart  Antennas to implement antenna beam forming in an  aerospace communications environment. The Smart  Antenna is contrasted against Fast Fourier Transform  (FFT) based beamforming in order to quantify the  increase in both computational load and FPGA  resources required for muItibeam adaptive signal  processing in the Smart Antenna. The paper begins with  an overall discussion of Smart Antenna design and  general beam forming issues in high bandwidth  communications. Important design considerations such  as processing complexity in a constrained Size, Weight  and Power (SWaP) environment are discussed. The  focus of the paper is with respect to design and  implementation of digital beam forming wideband  communications waveforms using FPGAs. A MuItibeam  Time Delay element is introduced based on Lagrange  Interpolation. Design data for MuItibeam Smart  Antennas in FPGAs is provided in the paper as well as  reference circuits for implementation. Finally, an  example Multibeam Smart Antenna design is provided  based on a Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA. The MuItibeam Smart  Antenna example design illustrates the concepts  discussed in the paper and provides design insight into  Multibeam Smart Antenna implementation from the  point of view of implementation complexity, required  hardware, and overall system performance gain.
