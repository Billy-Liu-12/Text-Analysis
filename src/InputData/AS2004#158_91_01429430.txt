Abstract?Of signi?cant interest in the practical application of data association algorithms to target tracking in cluttered environments is how to determine track-loss in the absence of truth data. An approach is laid out for the Probabilistic Data Association Filter where the predicted measurement innovations covariance is used to de?ne nominal ?tracking? and ?track-lost? regimes, and the sample variance of the ?effective? ?lter innovations (prediction errors) is the metric used to determine the regime in a two-class decision rule. A major advantage of this method is that con?dence intervals can be placed on the probabilities of both correctly and incorrectly identifying the regimes. Theoretical approximations of the conditional mean and distribution of the sample innovations variance in the tracking and track-lost regimes are proposed for use in construction of the decision rule. Simulation results demonstrating the method are provided.



I. INTRODUCTION Real-world sensors often report more than one mea- surement that may be from a given target. These may either be measurements of the desired target or ?clutter? measurements. Clutter refers to detections or returns from nearby objects, clouds, electromagnetic interference, acous- tic anomalies, false alarms, etc. While the Probabilistic Data Association Filter (PDAF) [1] uses the Kalman ?lter (KF) structure for state estimation in the presence of clutter, the estimate eventually diverges from the true track due to measurement origin uncertainty. Although there is a continuum of behavior, the operation of the PDAF is often divided into two regimes, non-divergent (?tracking?) and divergent (?track-lost?). Typically the emphasis is more on de?ning the transition (?track-loss?) than on de?ning the regimes themselves.

In simulation, two metrics commonly used to de?ne the transition between the two regimes are [12]: 1) the norma- tive distance of the estimate from the truth, and 2) failure of the truth measurement to ?gate?. Gating is a commonly used method of limiting the number of measurements processed by considering only those within some normative distance of the predicted measurement. In practice, neither of these metrics is applicable, as neither the true state nor the truth measurement is known. However, theory does show differences between the two regimes that can be exploited to build track-loss metrics that do not require having truth knowledge [5], [7], [9].

This work was supported in part by the U.S. Of?ce of Naval Research (Grant N00014-02-1-0136).

In the absence of truth data, ?ve (linked) quantities available from the PDAF as track-loss metrics are the KF gain, the state estimate error covariance, the predicted state estimate error covariance, the predicted measurement inno- vations covariance, and the actual measurement innovations.

The ?rst four quantities might be said to de?ne the ??lter status?. Previously, detection of track-loss in the absence of truth data has been done by testing the normality of the measurement innovations [7]. In this paper, the over- all strategy is to construct a two-class (Neyman-Pearson) decision rule which determines the operating regime of the PDAF by comparing the sample variance of recent  ?effective? measurement innovations to a function of the theoretical predicted measurement innovations covariance in each regime. A major advantage of this method is that con?dence intervals can be placed on the probabilities of both correctly and incorrectly identifying the regimes.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the    This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the PDAF for linear time invariant (LTI) systems is reviewed.

De?nitions of the tracking and track-lost regimes are made, based on mean ?lter statuses constructed using determin- istic approximations to the PDAF. In Section III, a two- class decision rule (regime test) is proposed, comparing the sample variance of recent prediction errors to the theoretical predicted measurement innovations covariance for each track regime in order to make an assignment.

The decision rule is based on the mean and distribution of the sample variance of prediction errors conditioned on the regime of operation. Toward this purpose, a single measurement prediction error must be de?ned for the PDAF, the ?effective? measurement innovation. An example of this approach is provided in Section IV, and simulation results and conclusions are presented in Sections V and VI.



II. TRACK REGIME MODELING VIA SCALAR INFORMATION REDUCTION FACTOR APPROXIMATIONS In this section, an LTI model of the system to be tracked, the Kalman ?lter, and the PDAF are reviewed. The basis of models of the tracking and track-lost regimes are then cre- ated using deterministic scalar information reduction factor (SIRF) approximations to the estimate error covariance of the Kalman ?lter [2], [3], [4], [11].

A. System Dynamics Consider the discrete-time LTI system with target state dynamics x(k) and measurements z(k) governed by x(k + 1) = F x(k) + G w(k) (1) 43rd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control December 14-17, 2004 Atlantis, Paradise Island, Bahamas 0-7803-8682-5/04/$20.00 ?2004 IEEE FrA06.3 y(k) = H x(k) (2) z(k) = H x(k) + J v(k) (3) = y(k) + J v(k) where F, G, H, and J are assumed known, and w and v are zero-mean Gaussian white noise vectors with known covariances Q = E [ww?] and R = E [vv?], respectively.

B. Kalman Filter For the LTI system, the discrete-time KF equations are Predicted covariance: P(k|k ? 1) = F P(k ? 1|k ? 1) F? + G Q G? (4) Predicted state: x?(k|k ? 1) = F x?(k ? 1|k ? 1) (5) Covariance of the innovations: S(k) = H P(k|k ? 1) H? + R (6) Kalman gain: K(k) = P(k|k ? 1) H? S(k)?1 (7) State estimate: x?(k|k) = x?(k|k ? 1) + K(k) ?(k) (8) where ?(k) = {z(k) ?H x?(k|k ? 1)} is the measurement innovation, or the ?lter prediction error.

Estimate error covariance: P(k|k) = P(k|k ? 1)?K(k) S(k) K(k)? (9) = {I?K(k) H} P(k|k ? 1).

The steady-state values of the matrices P(k|k ? 1), S(k), K(k), and P(k|k) are P?kf , Skf Kkf , and Pkf , respectively.

C. The Probabilistic Data Association Filter  In the data association problem, additional measurement uncertainties are considered beyond those in the Kalman ?lter (which are due strictly to additive Gaussian white noise in the measurements). It is commonly considered that [1]: 1) there is a probability PD, PD ? 1, that the measurement for a given target will be detected, 2) there are ?clutter? measurements with density ? uniformly distributed through- out the measurement ?eld, and 3) in order to limit the number of clutter measurements considered, all available measurements are gated , keeping only those measurements that fall into a validation volume (gate) around the predicted    that fall into a validation volume (gate) around the predicted measurement z?(k) = H x?(k|k ? 1). The PDAF uses the structure of the Kalman ?lter with the following changes to accommodate data association [1]: State estimate: The chi-square gating test for a measure- ment zi(k) is {zi(k)?H x?(k|k?1)}? S(k)?1{zi(k)?H x?(k|k?1)} ? ?

(10) where ? is the chi-square gate size measured in standard deviations squared. PG, the probability of gating the truth measurement, is a function of ?. All measurements vali- dated by this test are inside a hyper-ellipsoid with volume Vk = cnz ?

nz/2 |S(k)|1/2 (11) where nz is the dimension of the measurement vector and cnz is the volume of a nz-dimensional unit hyper-sphere, cnz = ?

nz/2/ ?(nz/2 + 1) (12) and ?(?) is the Gamma function. The number of gated measurements is Poisson distributed where E[mk] = ?Vk . (13) Each measurement zi(k), i = 1, ...,mk is processed x?i(k|k) = x?(k|k?1)+K(k) {zi(k)?H x?(k|k?1)} (14) and then the a posteriori estimates x?i(k|k) and the a priori estimate x?(k|k?1) are combined into an estimate x?(k|k) = ?0x?(k|k ? 1) + mk?

i=1 ?ix?i(k|k) (15) where ?i is the probability that zi(k) is the correct mea- surement: ?0 = b b + ?mk j=1 ej ?i = ei b + ?mk j=1 ej ei = exp{???i S(k)?1 ?i/2} ?i = zi(k)?H x?(k|k ? 1) b = (2 ? ?)nz/2 ?Vk cnz (1? PD PG)/PD Estimate error covariance: P?(k|k) = P(k|k ? 1)? (1? ?0) K(k) S(k) K(k)?

D. Predicting the Filter Status With a SIRF Approximation It is possible to use Monte Carlo simulation to predict the ?lter status of the PDAF in each track regime. However, simulation is time-consuming and computationally inten- sive, and the results are applicable only to the particular system and operating point. It would be preferable to have a model that predicts the ?lter status for each regime.

The ?lter status is a complex stochastic function of the gate and measurements, but a deterministic approximation to the estimate error covariance P(k|k) can be made [2], [3], [4], [9], [11] P(k|k) = P(k|k ? 1)? ?(k) K(k) S(k) K(k)? (17)    where ?(k), 0 ? ?(k) ? 1, is a scalar information reduction factor. Basically, ?(k) provides a sense of how the informa- tion from the measurements improves the error covariance.

It may be dif?cult to derive a satisfactory relation for a given data association method, but it has been shown [2], [3], [11] that for the PDAF with a ?xed set of parameters PD, nz , and ?, ?(k) can be approximated as ?(?Vk), where ?Vk is the expected number of measurements in the gate. Keeping some terms that are discarded in the ?nal approximation in [3], the deterministic estimate error covariance can be written as P(k|k) = P(k|k ? 1)? ?(?Vk) K(k) S(k) K(k)? (18) ?(?Vk) = (PD PG ? q1 + q2) (19) where q ? = Kgauss ??

PD PG)/PD (21) and Kgauss =    Kgauss = PD cnz (2?)nz/2 ( nz ?nz/2 )mk?1 (22) Kunif = (1? PD PG)(?Vk) ( nz ?nz/2 )mk?1 . (23) Solving the integral generally requires stochastic methods as well as appropriate truncations of the in?nite series [3]. Using spherical coordinates in (20) takes advantage of symmetry properties to reduce the computational burden of the stochastic integrals.

E. SIRF Approximation for the Nominal PDAF Filter Status for the Tracking Regime This deterministic approximation can be used to predict the nominal ?steady-state? ?lter status (P?, S, K, and P) in the tracking regime (hereafter denoted by the subscript T) by iterating equations (4), (6), (7), (11), and (18) until convergence. Convergence is not, however, guaranteed for all values of ? and all systems [3]. Once the stochastic parts of (19) have been computed off-line, the results can be applied to a range of systems with little additional computational cost.

The assumption Kunif ? 0 is made [2], [3], [11] so that P(k|k) = P(k|k ? 1)? ?T(?Vk) K(k) S(k) K(k)? (24) ?T(?Vk) = (PD PG ? q1 + q2) (25) where, approximately, q1 = PD cnz (2?)nz/2 I1 (26) I1 = ? ?1/2 exp(?r2/2) rnz+1 dr (27) q2 = PD cnz (2?)nz/2  (28) ? ??

F. SIRF Approximation for the Nominal PDAF Filter Status for the Track-Lost Regime The nominal ?steady-state? ?lter status in the track- lost regime (hereafter denoted by the subscript L) can be predicted by assuming that PD = 0 in (22) and (23) (but not in (21) as this is a parameter of the data association ?lter) so that P(k|k) = P(k|k ? 1)? ?L(?Vk) K(k) S(k) K(k)? (30) ?L(?Vk) = (PD PG ? q1 + q2) (31) where q ? = Kunif ??

Thus in the track-lost regime the covariance estimate will grow without bound while there are no clutter measurements being gated, while being bounded when clutter measurements are gated, which is the observed trend.

Note also that (32) assumes that mk ? 1 (at least one measurement will fall inside the gate). In practice, this is not true for ?small? values of ?, as there is commonly a sig- ni?cant probability that no measurements will gate for any given timestep. From (4)-(8), it is at least mathematically consistent to interpret the case of no measurements gating as zero prediction error; however, the resulting overall distribution of prediction errors is then non-Gaussian.

While more sophisticated approximations have been de- veloped [9] that make better estimates of track lifetime, this approximation makes acceptable steady-state predictions of the nominal ?lter status in both the tracking and track-lost regimes. The computational burden of using these SIRF approximations is signi?cantly less than that of Monte Carlo simulation of the system.

G. Extensions to Other Data Association Methods This strategy is suitable for other data association meth- ods, though the derivation may be dif?cult. For example, a model for track-lifetime prediction of the Nearest Neighbor method [10] could be adopted in much the same way. Even if no suitable theoretical model is available for the data association method in question, it may be possible to use simulation to obtain functions for ?T(?Vk) and ?L(?Vk).



III. A TRACK REGIME DECISION RULE

III. A TRACK REGIME DECISION RULE In this section, a two-class (Neyman-Pearson) decision rule is developed which classi?es the regime of operation as either tracking or track-lost based on the ?steady-state? predicted covariance of measurement innovations S for each regime and the sample variance, s2, of the ?effective? measurement innovations, ?e?(k). The decision rule assigns a con?dence levels for the classi?cation.

A. Candidate Statistical Tests If there are two hypotheses HT and HL, and two operating classes (regimes) CT and CL, then there are four possible outcomes to the hypothesis assignment: 1) HL|CL, correct track-lost assignment.

2) HL|CT, incorrect track-lost assignment.

3) HT|CL, incorrect tracking assignment.

4) HT|CT, correct tracking assignment.

The con?dence level is the a posteriori probability of a correct assignment, that is the a posteriori probability of either case (1) or (4).

The commonly used maximum a posteriori (MAP), min- imum probability of error (MPE), and Bayes decision rules require knowledge of both the a priori probabilities, P (C), as well as the conditional probabilities, P (H |C). However, if only the conditional probabilities are known (as is the case here), the Neyman-Pearson decision rule can be used.

The conditional probability densities can be approximated using the SIRF approximations.

B. A Model for the Distribution of the Sample Variances Consider of the j-th element of the ?lter prediction error ?, denoted ?j . The unbiased sample variance of ?j over n timesteps is s2?j = n? 1  n?

i=1 (?j(i)? ??j)2. (33) Assuming that within a given regime the prediction errors (pe) are Gaussian distributed (which is only an approxi- mation in the case of data association) and that ?2?j is the theoretical variance of ?j then (n? 1) s2?j ?2?j = ?2?j n?

i=1 (?j(i)? ??j)2 (34) is ?2 distributed with n ? 1 degrees of freedom, so the probability density function of s2?j is( (n?1) s2?j ?2 ?j )(n?3)/2 exp ( ? (n?1) s ?j 2 ?2 ?j ) ?2 ?j (n?1) 2 (n?1)/2 ?(n?12 ) for s2?j &gt; 0.

(35) C. Neyman-Pearson Rule for the Prediction Errors The Neyman-Pearson rule for each ?j is then [6]    The Neyman-Pearson rule for each ?j is then [6] Decide track-lost if P (s2?j |HL) P (s2?j |HT) &gt; ?np (36) Decide tracking if P (s2?j |HL) P (s2?j |HT) &lt; ?np where ?np is the Neyman-Pearson threshold, which is to be determined. Substituting (35) into P (s ?j |HL) P (s2 ?j |HT) yields( (?2?j |HT) (?2 ?j |HL) )(n?1)/2 exp ( (n?1) s2?j (?2?j |HL)?(?2?j |HT)  (?2 ?j |HT)(?2?j |HL) ) (37) so taking the natural log of (36) and then rearranging gives the decision rule Decide track-lost if f(?np) &lt; s2?j (38) Decide tracking if f(?np) &gt; s2?j where f(?np) = (n? 1) (?2?j |HT)(?2?j |HL) (?2?j |HL)? (?2?j |HT) (39) ? ln ?

?( (?2?j |HL) (?2?j |HT) )(n?1)/2 ?np ?

? .

Since the primary focus is on detecting the track-lost regime, the associated probabilities for the hypothesis as- signments are de?ned [6]: 1) PDET = prob. of track-lost regime detection = P (HL|CL) 2) PFA = prob. of false alarm = P (HL|CT) 3) PMISS = prob. of missing track-lost regime = P (HT|CL) 4) PCD = prob. of correct dismissal = P (HT|CT) and these probabilities are related by: PMISS = 1? PDET (40) PFA = 1? PCD .

Note that PDET, the probability of the test detecting the track-lost regime, is not to be confused with PD, the probability of the truth measurement being detected by the ?lter. In the observation space [6] PFA = ? ?

?

?

( (n?1) s2?j (?2 ?j |HT) )(n?3)/2 exp ( ? (n?1) s ?j 2 (?2 ?j |HT) ) (?2 ?j |HT) (n?1) ?( n?1 2 ) 2 (n?1)/2 ds2?j  (41) PDET = ? ?

?

( (n?1) s2?j (?2 ?j |HL) )(n?3)/2 exp ( ? (n?1) s ?j 2 (?2 ?j |HL) ) (?2 ?j |HL) (n?1) ?( n?1 2 ) 2 (n?1)/2 ds2?j (42) where ? = (n? 1) (?2?j |HT)(?2?j |HL) (?2?j |HL)? (?2?j |HT) (43) ? ln ?

?

( (?2?j |HL) (?2?j |HT) )(n?1)/2 ?np ?

? .

Thus all four probabilities are governed by two equations in four unknowns: n, ?np, (?2?j |HT), and(?2?j |HL).

in four unknowns: n, ?np, (?2?j |HT), and(?2?j |HL).

The Neyman-Pearson decision rule is said to maximize the probability of detecting the track-lost regime, PDET, for a given n, subject to the constraint that PFA is less than or equal to some user-de?ned probability. [6]. However, it is convenient in this context to instead ?x both PDET and PFA at some desired values, and use (41)-(43) to determine the corresponding minimum (integer) number of timesteps n that must be used in order to meet these goals. Typically, there is a range of values of ?np that will achieve them.

Appropriate values of n and ?np can be determined for each pe element ?j using (41)-(43), and track regime determinations for each element can then be made using (38)-(39). Thus there is an independent track-loss metric for each pe element; if a single overall track-loss metric is desired, Wishart distributed versions of (33)-(35) can also be used in the development of the Neyman-Pearson decision rule. However, because of the approximate nature of the distribution in (35), it is dif?cult to know what  additional covariance information is useful in the matrix likelihood test [5]. Further, a Wishart implementation has the disadvantage of being more computationally intensive than the implementation outlined above.

D. Application to the PDAF In order to implement the Neyman-Pearson rule, (15) can be rewritten x?(k|k) = x?(k|k ? 1) + K(k) ?e?(k) (44) where, for the PDAF, ?e?(k) = [ mk?

i=1 ?i zi(k)? (1? ?0) H x?(k|k ? 1) ] .

(45) This ?effective? measurement innovation is then the single ?lter prediction error for purposes of calculating the sample variances s2?j . The j-th diagonal of the innovations covari- ance for the tracking regime, ST?sirf , and track-lost regime, SL?sirf , can then be used for (?2?j |HT) and (?2?j |HL), respectively.

Some method of handling the case of no gated mea- surements must be implemented. As suggested earlier, it is at least mathematically consistent in this case to de?ne the measurement innovations as zero. However, when there is a signi?cant probability of zero measurements gating, the assumption that the prediction errors have a Gaussian distribution will be a poor one; in practice, this probability is likely to be signi?cant both when PD &lt; 1 and when in the track-lost regime. So the goals for PDET and PFA will not generally be met unless the innovations from timesteps when no measurements gate are excluded, and it is necessary to use the previous nC timesteps to ?nd n non- zero innovations with which to compute s2?j . The average number of timesteps n?T used when the ?lter is operating in the tracking regime is approximately n/(PDPG). The average number of timesteps n?L used to when the ?lter is in the track-lost regime is problem speci?c.

E. Extensions to Other Data Association Methods This strategy is suitable for other data association meth- ods. For the NN ?lter, the KF measurement innovations are the prediction errors. For MAP and maximum likelihood (ML) methods, the single vector prediction errors can be determined by similarly deriving a relationship between the estimated state, predicted state, and Kalman gain.



IV. EXAMPLE: PDAF TRACK REGIME TEST In this section, an example system using the PDAF is constructed. The SIRF approximation steady-state innova- tions covariances for the tracking and track-lost regimes are calculated and compared to simulation results. An example    calculated and compared to simulation results. An example Neyman-Pearson decision rule is determined. Theoretical and simulation results for the probabilities of detection of the track-lost regime, PDET, and of false alarm while in the tracking regime, PFA, are given. An estimate of the number of timesteps required to detect track-loss is also provided.

] w(k) (46) y(k) = [ 1 0 ] x(k) (47) is the standard zero-order hold discrete approximation to a continuous double-integrator system. For ? = 0.1, x(k + 1) = [ 1 0.1 0 1 ] x(k) + [ 0.005 0.1 ] w(k) . (48) B. Kalman Filter System For Q = Q = 1000, R = R = 0.1 , P?kf = [ 0.3000 1.9998 1.9998 19.9965 ] , Skf = 0.4000 are the steady-state covariances.

C. Clutter and Gating Though the example system is dependent on Q,R, ?, and ?, it can be described in the tracking regime using just three independent parameters [12]: the probability of detecting the truth measurement, PD, the normalized target acceleration, (NTA) = Q ?4R , and the normalized clutter den- sity, (NCD) = ?R. NTA is a measure of how aggressively the target is maneuvering, and NCD is a measure of how dif?cult it is to localize the target from the measurements.

For the example system, NTA = 1. Choosing PD = 1 ? = 0.02 results in NCD = 0.002, and an average track-lifetime of approximately 500 timesteps using the PDAF [8], [12]; this is a tracking problem of ?moderate? dif?culty for the example dynamics.

Using a four standard deviation gate (? = 16) yields PG = 0.99994. For the example system, nz = 1, cnz = 2, and Vk = 8 |S(k)|1/2.

D. Experimental Tracking and Track-lost Regimes The following experimental setup allows for ?controlled? track-loss and is used to verify operation of the track- loss detector. Until timestep 1000, the ?lter is tracking in the sense that PD = 1 (the truth measurement is always    available to the gating test). For timesteps 1001 through 2000, PD = 0 (the truth measurement is never available to the gating test) and thus the ?lter is track-lost in the sense that the truth measurement is never gated. PFA can then be calculated using measurement innovations from the ?rst 1000 timesteps, and PDET from using measurement innovations from the second 1000 timesteps, with roughly 1000 values of s2?j being tested by the decision rule in each  regime. Note that PDET is thus calculated using both data points from the transient of ?controlled? track-loss as well as from the ?steady-state? operation of the ?lter in the track- lost regime.

E. PDAF SIRF Tracking Approximation For the example system with tracking regime assump- tions: PG ? PD = 1, q1 ? PD = 1 [3], and (25) becomes ?T(?Vk) = cnz (2?)nz/2 ??

ating (4), (6), (7), (11), and (24) (using (49) to calculate ?T(?Vk)) to steady-state yields ??T = 0.9602, ?V?k = 0.1047, and P?T?sirf = [ 0.3286 2.1122 2.1122 20.5492 ] , ST?sirf = 0.4286 .

Simulating and then averaging P(k|k? 1) and S(k) in the example PDAF tracking regime over 1000 timesteps gives P?T?sim = [ 0.3210 2.0831 2.0831 20.3698 ] , ST?sim = 0.4210 .

Thus ST?sirf has only 1.7% error when compared to the more time-consuming simulation results.

F. PDAF SIRF Track-lost Approximation Figure 1 shows the function for ?L(?Vk) for the example system with track-lost regime assumptions. Iterating (4), (6),    (7), (11), (30), and (31) to steady-state yields ??L = 0.3264, ?V?k = 0.4594, and P?L?sirf = [ 8.1431 15.8765 15.8765 56.2960 ] , SL?sirf = 8.2431 .

Simulating and then averaging P(k|k? 1) and S(k) in the example PDAF track-lost regime over 1000 timesteps gives P?L?sim = [ 9.1253 17.3318 17.3318 54.3980 ] , SL?sim = 9.2253 .

SL?sirf has 10.8% error when compared to the more time-consuming simulation results. In general, it has been observed that the approximation for the tracking regime is more accurate than for the track-lost regime when compared to the simulation results.

G. Neyman-Pearson Decision Rule PDET ? 0.99 and PFA ? 0.01 are reasonable targets for the decision rule. The number of effective innovations n necessary to meet these goals can be calculated by incre- menting n until, for some value(s) of ?np, PDET ? 0.99 and PFA ? 0.01 (see Figure 2).

A good value for ?np (one that exceeds the goals for both PDET and PFA) is then ?np = 0.4067, which from (41)-(43) yields PDET = 0.9901 and PFA = 0.0099. Using the means of 25 trials of the example experimental setup, and the decision rule (38)-(39) with n = 7, ?np = 0.4067, ST?sirf = 0.4286, and SL?sirf = 8.2431, the experimental results were PDET = 0.9997 and PFA = 0.0132. Though the actual process of track-loss is dif?cult to quantify, the experimental results n?T = 7.0 and n?L = 24.9 do provide some insight into the number of timesteps necessary for track-loss detection, as the average number of timesteps necessary, n?Loss, should be bounded by n?T ? n?Loss ? n?L.



V. SIMULATION RESULTS Table 1 provides a comparison of experimental values for PDET, PFA, n?T, and n?F across large ranges of NTA and NCD for PDAF simulation data when PD = 1. For each NTA-NCD combination, n and ?np have been chosen such that, theoretically, PDET ? 0.99 and PFA ? 0.01, with n as small as possible. The mean track-lifetime of all NTA-NCD combinations is approximately 100 timesteps where NCD is labeled ?High?, 1000 timesteps where NCD is labeled ?Medium?, and 10,000 timesteps where NCD is labeled ?Low? [12]. The experimental values of PDET, and PFA were calculated using the means of 25 trials of the example  experimental setup; trials were selected from realizations where track-loss did not occur until forced at timestep 1001.

where track-loss did not occur until forced at timestep 1001.

Having the tracking and track-lost variances of the in- novations spaced well apart is the condition for small n.

As Table 1 shows, this condition is met less often for low values of NTA.

In the track-lost regime, the assumption that the validated prediction errors are Gaussian distributed is usually quite conservative since the sample variances are generally larger than for a Gaussian distribution. This contributes to gen- erally exceeding the PDET goals. Conversely, the sample variances in the tracking regime, while more Gaussian, are still somewhat larger than would be expected from a Gaussian distribution, meaning that the PFA goals may not always be met. However, because n is restricted to integer values, the theoretical values of both PDET and PFA often exceed the desired values signi?cantly for low values of n.

Unlike the tracking regime, the track-lost regime cannot be described solely in terms of PD , NTA, and NCD. SL is non-linearly dependent on ?, so n, PDET, and PFA vary with ? as well. This can be seen by comparing the Medium NTA results in Table 1 with those in Table 2, where identical values of PD , NTA, and NCD constructed from different values of Q, R, and ? yield different results for n.

In general, lowering PD increases the tracking regime innovations variance ST?sirf , reducing the separation from SL?sirf and thus having the tendency to raise the required n to meet the goals for PDET and PFA. This can be seen by comparing the Low NTA data in Table 1 (PD = 1) with Table 3 (PD = 0.9).

Over the parameter space explored, the test (decision rule) appears to give good results.



VI. CONCLUSION AND ONGOING WORK A strategy has been laid out for creating a two-class deci- sion rule to determine the regime of operation for the PDAF in the absence of truth data. Scalar information reduction factors can be used in an iterative scheme to predict the steady-state innovations covariance for both the tracking and track-lost regimes, which results in lower computational burden when compared to Monte Carlo simulation. Then a distribution can be assumed for the sample variances of the prediction errors. Together, these pieces of information con- stitute a model around which a Neyman-Pearson decision rule can be constructed, where the con?dences in both the probability of track-loss detection and of false alarms are explicitly chosen. Good performance of the test as a track- loss detector was demonstrated for an example system over a large range of tracking dif?culties.

Ongoing work includes modeling the effective innova- tions (45) as Gaussian mixtures when determining the theoretical distributions for the prediction errors used in the decision rule (38). For reasons noted earlier, it is desirable to more accurately model the sample distribution of the innovations variance, and it has been shown that the prediction errors of many data association algorithms can be well approximated by a Gaussian mixture [13].
