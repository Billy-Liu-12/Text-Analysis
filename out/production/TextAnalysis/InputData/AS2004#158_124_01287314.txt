Abstract Web usage mining is the process of extracting interesting patterns from web logs.  This paper proposes an IPA (Integrating Path traversal patterns and Association rules) model for web usage mining in the EC (Electronic Commerce) environment.  The IPA model takes both the traveling and purchasing behaviors of customers into consideration at the same time to overcome the disadvantages of the pure association rule mining and pure path traversal pattern mining.  The IPA model considers not only user traversal forward information but also backward information.  Besides, web structure is also used in this paper to prune unnecessary candidates.

Especially, the IPA model allows the noise exist in web transactions.  The experimental results show that the IPA model can correctly capture the user?s traversing and purchasing behaviors.

1. Introduction In EC (Electronic Commerce) environment, how to find the association rules between purchasing items [1, 2, 3] is very important.  If we provider this kind of information to the web site manager, the performance of cross-selling should be improved.  However, the web site managers may also pay attention to the navigation behaviors of customers.  Association rule mining just purely considered the purchasing behaviors of customers.  It cannot fully satisfy the managers? requirements.

Path traversal pattern mining [4, 5, 6] is the technique that find most of the navigation behaviors of customers in the EC environment.  The web site designer can use this information to improve the web site design, and to increase the web site performance.

Besides, this information can also provide the navigation suggestions to customers.  However, the web site manager considers not only the pure navigation behaviors but also the purchasing behaviors of customers.  The path traversal pattern mining just purely considered purchasing behaviors of customers.

It cannot fully satisfy the managers? requirements.

To overcome the disadvantages of the pure association rule mining and pure path traversal pattern mining, [7] proposed a model that takes both the traveling patterns and purchasing behaviors of customers into consideration at the same time.  We use an example to explain their method.  Figure 1 is an example of web transaction of a customer.  It shows the customer traverses from A to B (buys the item 1).  Next, the customer goes to C, and then goes to D.  Thereafter, the customer backs to C and then goes to E (buys item 3, 4).  Finally, the customer goes back to C and buys the item 2 at that time.

Figure 1. Web transaction of a user    Figure 1. Web transaction of a user First, [7] cuts each web transaction into several web transaction records.  Then, WTM/WTS algorithm is (EEE?04) 0-7695-2073-1/04 $20.00 ? 2004 IEEE used to discover the final results based on these web transaction records.  In [7], when the customer has the backward behavior, a web transaction record is generated.  Besides, if the last web page of a web transaction record does not purchase any items, it cannot be generated.  According to the Figure 1, three web transaction records are generated shown below.

Table 1. Web transaction records Path Purchases ABCE B{1}, C{2}, E{4}, E{3} ABFGH B{1}, H{6} ASJL S{7}, S{8}, L{9} Because web pages D and I do not purchase any items, the ABCD and ASI cannot be generated.  The reason for cutting each web transaction into web transaction records is that they think the backward movement is not meaningful.  Also, it can reduce the complexity of the algorithm.  However, in Figure 1, it is easy to see that the customer traverse to E and purchase items 3 and 4, and then back to C and purchase item 2 at that time.  From Table 1, the web transaction records show that the customer buys the item 2 at C and then buys items 3 and 4 at E.

Therefore, the order of traversing and purchasing is not correct after dividing.

In addition, they assume that the purchasing path is the shortest path from the root node to the purchasing node.  For instance, if the customer purchases at the L in Figure 1, they produce the purchasing path {A, S, L} that is the shortest path form the root node to the purchasing node L.  Hence, if there is not only one path from root node to the purchasing node, this method cannot work.  Because the web site architecture is usually regarded as a graph in real world, the purchasing path is not unique.

Consequently, their assumption is not reasonable.

For this reason, this paper proposes an IPA (Integrating Path traversal patterns and Association rules) model for web usage mining in the EC (Electronic Commerce) environment.  The IPA model also takes both the traveling and purchasing behaviors of customers into consideration at the same time to overcome the disadvantages of the pure association rule mining and pure path traversal pattern mining.

The IPA model considers not only user traversal forward information but also backward information.

Besides, web structure is also used in this paper to prune unnecessary candidates.  Especially, the IPA model allows the noise exist in web transactions.  The next section will describe our model in details.

2. IPA (Integrating Path traversal patterns and Association rules) model Before illustrating our model, we firstly describe the definitions about support and confidence.  The  following shows an example of our mining results.

&lt;ABCE: B{1} ? E{4}&gt; This example explains that if the customers purchase item 1 at web page B, they usually buy item 4 at web page E and the traversal path is ABCE.  We define the support of &lt;ABCE: B{1},E{4}&gt; is X/N.  N denotes the number of total customers.  X denotes the number of total customers who visit ABCE sequentially and purchase item 1 at web page B then purchase item 4 at web page E.  We also define the support of &lt;ABC: B{1}&gt; is Y/N.  N is the same as    support of &lt;ABC: B{1}&gt; is Y/N.  N is the same as above.  Y denotes the number of total customers who visit ABC sequentially and purchase item 1 at web page B.  Based on the definition of support, we can define the confidence of &lt;ABCE: B{1} ? E{4}&gt;.  It is shown below.

Y X )B{1}:ABCSupport( )E{4}B{1},:ABCESupport( )E{4}B{1}:ABCE(Confidence = &gt;&lt; &gt;&lt; = &gt;=&gt;&lt; The confidence explains that customers traverse ABC and purchase item 1 at web page B, and the probability of purchasing item 4 at web page E is X/Y.

Besides, a traversal sequence, e.g., ABC, is a set of web pages ordered by increasing traversal-time.  The support for a traversal sequence is the number of customers who visit this sequence sequentially.  If the support for a traversal sequence s satisfies the user-specified minimum support, then s is called a frequent traversal sequence.  The length of a traversal sequence is the number of web pages in the sequence.

A traversal sequence of length k is called a k-traversal sequence, and a frequent traversal sequence of length k is called a frequent k-traversal sequence.  Similarly, a purchase sequence is a set of web pages ordered by increasing traversal-time, and at least one of these web pages has purchasing behaviors.  The other definitions are the same as the traversal sequences.

Based on these definitions, the main procedure is listed below.

Phase Executing Step Phase 1 1. List all candidate 1-travelsal sequences and candidate 1-purchase sequences.

(EEE?04) 0-7695-2073-1/04 $20.00 ? 2004 IEEE 2. Scan database and calculate the support of candidate sequences.  Find all frequent 1-traversal sequences and frequent 1-purchase sequences.

3. Join the frequent 1-traversal sequences and frequent 1-purchase sequences to the same set, and then join any two sequences to form a new one which just has a direct link in the web site structure.  As a result, we can generate all candidate 2-traversal sequences and candidate 2-purchase sequences.

Phase K  (K&gt;=2) 1. Scan database and calculate the supports of candidate K-traversal sequences and candidate K-purchase sequences separately.  Then, find all frequent K- traversal sequences and frequent K-purchase sequences.

2. Put frequent K-traversal sequences and frequent K-purchases sequences to the same set and then join any two sequences to form a new one which just has a direct link in the web site structure to generate all candidate (K+1)-traversal sequences and (K+1)-purchase sequences.  That is, for any two different frequent K-sequences { }1-k21 S,,S,Sr, ? and { }t,S,,S,S 1-k21 ? , a    { }1-k21 S,,S,Sr, ? and { }t,S,,S,S 1-k21 ? , a (K+1)-sequences { }t,S,,S,Sr, 1-k21 ? will be generated.

3. Execute steps 1 and 2 recursively, until no frequent sequences can be generated.

In order to clearly explain our model, the following shows an example.  The web site structure is shown in Figure 2 and the customer traversing and purchasing database is shown in Table 2.  The notation ??? represents that the customer purchases on that web page.

Figure2. Web site structure Suppose the minimum support is set to 2/6.  First, we list all candidate 1-traversal sequences and candidate 1-purchase sequences (Phase 1, Step 1).  In this example, all candidate 1-traversal sequences are {A, B, C, D, E, F} and all candidate 1-purchse Table 2. Customer traversing and purchasing database ID Access Path Items Bought 1 BECAF?C F{1} 2 DBAC?AE? C{2}, E{3} 3 BDAE 4 BDECAF? C F{1} 5 BAC?AE? C{2}, E{3} 6 DAC? C{2} sequences are {C?, E?, F?}.  Next, we scan database and calculate the supports of these sequences.  Then, we find all frequent 1-traversal sequences and frequent 1-purchase sequences (Phase 1, Step 2).  In this step, the support count of C is 5.  In order to count C, we add up the original support count of C, i.e., 2, and support count of C?, i.e., 3.  Because the supports of all candidates are greater than the minimum support, all frequent 1-traversal sequences are {A, B, C, D, E, F} and all frequent 1-purchase sequences are {C?, E?, F?}.

Then, we put these sequences to the same set, i.e., {A, B, C, D, E, F, C?, E?, F?}, and then join any two sequences to form a new one which just has a direct link in the web site structure (Phase 1, Step 3).  For example, if we join frequent 1-traversal sequence {A} and frequent 1-purchase sequence {C?}, then candidate 2-purchase sequence {AC?} will be generated.

Because page A have a direct link to page C, we preserve this candidate 2-purchase sequence.

According to this way, we can generate all candidate 2-traversal sequences, i.e., {AC, AE, AF, BA, BD, BE, CA, DA, DB, DE, EC, FC} and candidate 2-purchase sequences, i.e., {AC?, AE?, AF?, BE?, DE?, EC?, FC?, C?A, E?C, E?C?, F?C, F?C?}.

Next, we scan database and calculate the supports of all candidate K-traversal sequences and candidate K-purchase sequences to find all frequent sequences (Phase 2, Step 1).  For instance, the support count of {AC} is 5 and {AC?} is 3.  Based on the minimum support, we can generate all frequent 2-traversal sequences, i.e., {AC, AE, AF, BA, BD, BE, CA, DA, DE, EC, FC}, and frequent 2-purchase sequences, i.e., {AC?, AE?, AF, BE?, C?A, F?C}.  All of these sequences have the direct link on the web site structure.

According to this way, we can generate all frequent sequences when k is equal to 5.  Suppose the minimum confidence is set to 1/2.  After finding all frequent sequences, the final mining results which integrate traversal patterns and purchasing behaviors are generated.  It is shown in Table 3.

As shown in Table 3, we consider not only forward information but also backward information, e.g., B D    D A C F E (EEE?04) 0-7695-2073-1/04 $20.00 ? 2004 IEEE &lt;ACAE: C{2} ? E{3}&gt;.  Especially, our approach Table 3. Mining results Pattern Suppor t Confidenc e &lt;BECAF: F{4}&gt; 2/6 2/2 &lt;BACAE: C{2} ? E{3}&gt; 2/6 2/2 &lt;ACAE: C{2} ? E{3}&gt; 2/6 2/2 &lt;ECAF: F{4}&gt; 2/6 2/2 &lt;BAE: E{3}&gt; 2/6 2/5 &lt;CAF: F{4}&gt; 2/6 2/4 &lt;DAC: C{2}&gt; 2/6 2/4 &lt;CAE: C{2} ? E{3}&gt; 2/6 2/2 &lt;AC: C{2}&gt; 3/6 3/6 allows the noise exist in the transactions.  For instance, &lt;BAE: E{3}&gt; is supported by customers 2 and 5, although BAE is not successive in the traversal paths of these two customers.  BAE is counted in the counting procedure because there is a direct link between pages B and A, and also pages A and E.  In other words, web pages between A and E can be seen as noises.

3. Experimental results The following experiments use a real web transaction database for testing the execution performance of our model.  This real database is a networked database for renting DVD movies.  We collect the user traversing and purchasing behaviors from 02/18/2001 to 03/24/2001.  There are 428,596 records in this database.  We partition this database into seven testing subsets.  The first testing subset includes the data of the first day (02/18/2001); the second testing subset includes the data of the first two days (02/18/2001~02/19/2001), and so on.  Based on these subsets, the experimental results for the execution performance of our IPA model are shown in Figure 3.

4. Conclusions In this paper, we propose an IPA (Integrating Path traversal patterns and Association rules) model for web    usage mining in the EC (Electronic Commerce) environment.  The experimental results show that our model can correctly find the customer?s traversing and purchasing behaviors.  In the future, we shall improve the process of trimming database and pruning candidates efficiently to speed up the algorithm.
