Abstract In this paper, we consider a system with K single-antenna client users, nB base stations (each base station has nR antennas) as well as a centralized controller. All the base stations operate at the same frequency and have optimal multi-user detection per base-station. A client user could be associated with a single base station at any time.

We consider a general problem of uplink macroscopic scheduling where the centralized controller dynamically determines an appro- priate association mapping of the K users with respect to the nB base stations over a macroscopic time scale. We propose a novel an- alytical framework for the above macroscopic scheduling problems.

A simple rule is to associate a user with the strongest base station (camp-on-the-strongest-cell) and this has been widely employed in conventional cellular systems. However, based on the optimization framework, we found that this conventional approach is in fact not optimal when multi-user detection is employed at the base station.

We show that the optimal macroscopic scheduling algorithm is of exponential complexity and we propose a simple greedy algorithm as a feasible solution. It is shown that the macroscopic scheduling gain relative to the conventional approach increases with increas- ing nR (due to the extra degree of freedom introduced by multiple antennas) and decreasing path loss exponent (due to large area of overlapping).

1 Introduction Various methods have been proposed to enhance the wireless sys- tem capacity in the past decades. Multiple antenna technology and multi-user detection technology are two of the most important and promising techniques to enhance the uplink capacity of various wire- less systems[1, 2]. They are briefly reviewed below.

MIMO Technologies: Given a fixed power budget, the only way to increase the bit rate is to increase the bandwidth of transmis- sion. With multiple antennas at both the transmitter (nT ) and receiver (nR), the wireless communication channel becomes a Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) channel, for which the link capacity gain is enhanced by the n = min{nT , nR} spatial channels induced by the array of antennas. However, optimizing the MIMO link performance is insufficient from a system perspective. Indeed, it is also very important to con- sider the resource management dimension at the system level to effectively exploit the performance potential of multiple- antenna technologies in multiuser systems. In [3], the schedul- ing efficiency of a multi-user single antenna system is shown to be greatly enhanced by a jointly adaptive physical layer and scheduling approach where a scheduling decision is made by considering the instantaneous throughput achievable by the user.

Multi-user Detection Technologies: Conventional methods of ra- dio resource partitioning are based on orthogonal partition in the sense that channels between users do not interfere with each other. For example, FDMA (Frequency Division Multi- ple Access), TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) and De- terministic CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) are well- known examples of orthogonal multi-access schemes. It has been shown by [4] that the optimal multi-access scheme re- sult in non-orthogonal channels and user signals are separated by joint detection. The multi-user detection problem is similar  to the time-domain equalization problem. Recently, multi-user detection has been actively investigated as a promising candi- date to enhance the uplink system capacity of 3G cellular sys- tems.

However, in all these works, the focus is on a single cell system.

The system performance of multi-cell systems with optimal multi-    The system performance of multi-cell systems with optimal multi- user detection and multiple antennas at the base station has not been investigated by previous literature. In this paper, we propose, for the first time, a novel theoretical framework for performance analysis of multiple antenna system involving multiple base stations and multi- user detection per base station. There are K single-antenna mobile users, nB base stations (each has nR antennas) as well as a central- ized controller as illustrated in figure 1. This is a generic multi-cell architecture model which could be applied to cellular systems as well as wireless LAN public access systems.

All the base stations operate in the same frequency with optimal multi-user detection. Encoding and decoding of packet frames are done at individual base station level and there is no joint decoding between multiple base stations. A client user could be associated with a single base station only at any time. The problem is to find WCNC 2004 / IEEE Communications Society 560 0-7803-8344-3/04/$20.00 ? 2004 IEEE Figure 1: Block diagram of the multicell system with nB base sta- tions (each has nR receive antennas), K client users (each has single antenna) and a centralized controller.

out a dynamic association mapping between all the K users and the nB base stations over a macroscopic time scale such that the system performance is optimized. The algorithm shall run at the centralized controller and is referred to macroscopic scheduling. A simple and widely used algorithm (e.g. in GSM, CDMA, UMTS systems)[5] is for every mobile to always camp on the strongest cell. However, as we shall illustrate, this is in fact not the optimal strategy when multi- user detection is available at the base station. The performance gap could be quite large especially for multiple antenna base stations.

Based on the analytical formulation, we propose a greedy algorithm for the optimization problem and compare the system performance relative to the conventional camp-on-the-strongest-cell approach.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we outline the multi-cell architecture as well as the multi-user SIMO channel model. In Section 3, we formulate the theoretical framework for the multi-cell macroscopic scheduling problem with multiple antennas and convex utility functions. In Section 4, we propose two heuristic algorithms for the optimization problem with low implementation complexity. In Section 5, we present numerical results on the per- formance gains of the proposed algorithms. Finally, we conclude with a brief summary of results in Section 6.

2 Multi-cell Multi-user SIMO System Model In this section, we describe the overall system model involving multi-cell multi-user SIMO1 channel model as well as adaptive multi-user physical layer model at each base station.

1SIMO refers to Single-Input, Multiple-Output.

2.1 Multi-user Multi-cell SIMO Channel Model The nR ? 1 dimensional channel matrix between user k and the nR receive antennas at base station b is given by ?

Lk,bHk,b whereHk,b is a nR ? 1 dimension vector corresponding to microscopic fading due to scattering and multipath, Lk,b is a scalar corresponding to the combined effect of path loss and macroscopic fading (or shad- owing). The microscopic fading between different users, different antennas and different base stations are modeled as i.i.d. complex Gaussian process with unit variance and it varies over a microscopic time scale2. On the other hand, the shadowing term is modeled as log-normal distributed with mean given by the path loss and stan- dard derivation given by 4 dB and it varies over a macroscopic time  scale (5 - 10 sec). Moreoever, shadowing between different users and different base stations are modeled as independent random vari- ables.

The received signal at the b?th base-station is given by: Yb = K?

k=1 ?

Lk,bHk,bXk + Zb (1) where Xk is the transmit symbol from the k-th mobile terminal, Zb is the nR ? 1 dimension Gaussian noise with covariance given by    is the nR ? 1 dimension Gaussian noise with covariance given by ?2zInR and Yb is the nR ? 1 dimension vector of received symbols at the b?th base-station.

The encoding and decoding frames are assumed to be short bursts3 which are much shorter than the coherence time of the fast fading. Due to the short burst duration, power adaptation within a coding frame is unnecessary because the channel fading will be highly correlated within the entire coding frame. The average trans- mitted power of the k-th mobile terminal is assumed to be con- strained (where the averaging window is over one encoding frame) to Pk. That is E [|Xk|2] ? Pk.

2.2 Centralized Controller Processing The centralized controller is responsible for determining the dy- namic association mapping between the K users and the nB base stations. Once every Topt second, the b?th base stations pass the estimated path losses {L1,b, ..., LK,b} from the K users to the cen- tralized controller. These inputs will be used for the macroscopic scheduling algorithm in the centralized controller to produce the association mapping for the K users. Specifically, the association mapping is given by the K?dimension vector B = (?1, ..., ?K) where ?k ? [0, nB ? 1] denotes the associated base station for user k. Alternatively, define the association set for the b?th base station as Ab = {k : ?k = b ?k ? [1,K]}. This association mapping is then passed to the nB base stations.

2For pedestrian user with speed around 5 km/hr, the coherence time of micro- scopic fading is around 50 ms for 2.4 GHz carrier.

3This is a reasonable assumption because most high speed wireless data systems operate in short burst mode. For example, in UMTS-HSDPA, a typical burst only last for 2 ms which is much shorter than the coherence time of slow fading channels (at pedestrian speed). Thus, the fading coefficients are highly correlated within a coding frame WCNC 2004 / IEEE Communications Society 561 0-7803-8344-3/04/$20.00 ? 2004 IEEE 2.3 Base Station Processing From (1), the received signal at the b?th base station could be writ- ten as: Yb = ?

ThermalNoise (2) The b?th base station processes in-cell signals based on the asso- ciation set Ab. Signals from users k /? Ab are treated as intercell interference. We assume that the transmitted packets are decoded at  the base station level and there is no joint decoding across different base stations at the centralized controller level.

In order to isolate the performance of the link level from any specific implementation details of modulation, channel coding and multi-user detector, we take an information theoretic approach4 on the multiaccess performance and assume that each base station has an optimal multiuser detector. Let rk be the conditional average data rate of the k?th mobile conditioned on a path loss realiza- tion {Lk,b}. Assume that the b?th base station has full knowl- edge5 of channel matrices, {Hk,b : k ? Ab}, and path losses, {Lk,b : k ? Ab}, of all the associated users . From Shannon?s multi- access information theory[4], the single-cell capacity region (given {Lk,b}) for all users associated with base station b is given by: ?r(S) ? EH [I((Xi)i?S ;Yb|(Xi)i?Ab?S)] ?S ? Ab (3) for some input distribution ?k?Abp(Xk) where ?r(S) denotes?

i?S ri. The capacity region could be achieved by successive in-    i?S ri. The capacity region could be achieved by successive in- terference cancellation.

From (1), since the channel noise is Gaussian, the capacity achiev- ing distribution p(Xk) is also Gaussian. Given a user association mapping, {Ab}, and the path loss matrix, {Lk,b}, the average multi- user capacity region R? (averaged over path loss matrices) of the K client mobiles for the multi-cell system with nB base stations is given by EL[R] which is: ?R(S) ? EL [ EH [ nB?

2.4 Mobile Assisted Path Loss Estimation As mentioned in section 2.2, all the nB base stations have to report the estimated path loss to the centralized controller for macroscopic scheduling. In this section, we describe how the base station esti- mates the path loss. Figure 2 illustrates the mobile assisted path loss estimation scheme.

4With the application of advanced channel coding schemes (such as turbo codes and LDPC codes) and multi-user detection, the physical layer performance is very close to the Shannon?s capacity region.

5Full knowledge of channel matrix could be achieved by channel estimation at the base station based on the pilot or preambles on uplink transmissions.

Figure 2: Mobile Assisted Path Loss Estimation The b?th base station transmits a common pilot channel with pe- riodic pilot pattern Sb(n), period Np ? nB and pilot power P0. The maximal likelihood estimate of the channel matrices is given by: ?? = (?

Since E [|hk,bw0|2] = 1 and Lk,b remains approximately constant over multiple (Nl) observations, a convenient estimate of the path loss is given by: L?k,b = Nl Nl?

i=1 | ??l[b]|2 (6) Hence, the b?th base station collects the path loss (or long-term channel gain) estimates {Lk,1, ..., Lk,nB} from all the mobile users associated with it (i.e. k ? Ab). The base station then reports the    associated with it (i.e. k ? Ab). The base station then reports the path loss estimates to the central controller for macroscopic schedul- ing.

3 Macroscopic Scheduling Problem For- mulation We characterize the system performance by means of linear system utility functions given by: U(R1, . . . , RK) = K?

k=1 ?kRk = EL [?

k ?krk ] (7) where Rk = EL[rk] is the average data rate of user k (averaged over shadowing and path loss) and ?k ? 0.

The macroscopic scheduling problem is given by: Problem 1. Determine the optimal association mapping policy, A({Lk,b) = {A1, ..,AnB}) so that the average system utility func- WCNC 2004 / IEEE Communications Society 562 0-7803-8344-3/04/$20.00 ? 2004 IEEE tion, U(R1, .., RK), is maximized and (R1, .., RK) ? R?. The opti- mization could be re-written as: EL [ max A(L) max r1,..,rK K?

k=1 ?krk subject to ?r ? R(L,A) ] (8) where R(L,A) is given by (4) Before we could solve the above optimization problem, we have to understand the structure of the multicell capacity region R?.

3.1 Structure of the Optimization Problem From (8), the original optimization problem 1 can be decoupled into two sub-problems. The inner problem corresponds to the base sta- tion processing and is given by: Problem 2. Given a realization of path loss matrices {Lk,b} and user association mapping Ab for b ? [1, nB ], find the rate vector that optimizes g(L,A) = ?k ?krk such that ?r ? R(L,A)  The outer problem corresponds to the central controller process- ing and is given by choosing the optimal user association mapping B = (?1, .., ?K) (or equivalently {A1, ..,AnB}) such that g(L,A) is optimized. This belongs to combinatorial optimization.

3.2 Optimal Solution to the Inner Problem Given any path loss realization {Lk,b}, and association mapping A, the solution to the inner optimization problem in Problem (2) is given by the rate vector, {r?1 , ..., r?K}.

. . . ? ?(?(K)).

As a result of 9, the optimization problem as specified in Problem 1 becomes a combinatorial optimization. The search space is of the order (nB)K and therefore, the optimal solution becomes infeasible for moderate K and nB .

4 Low Complexity Solution for the Outer Problem    In this section, we propose a novel greedy macroscopic scheduling algorithm with respect to two widely used utility functions, namely the maximal throughput and the proportional fairness. The algo- rithm is simple and greedy with linear complexity with respect to K.

4.1 Sub-optimal Macroscopic Scheduling ? Greedy Algorithm When base station has multi-user detection, conventional view on the camp-on-the-strongest cell approach suffers from performance loss because it is more effective to associate a client user to a single base station (due to interference cancellation) unless the client user is very far from the base station. Hence, we introduce a hystersis factor, ?L, in the proposed algorithm to take care of this effect. The algorithm is described below.

Algorithm 1. Step 1: Randomly generates a permutation on the nB base stations, ?? = (??(1), ...,m??(nB)).

Step 2: For k = 1 : K, scan the base station in descending order of the permutation {??(1), ??(2), ...} and associate user k with the base station (??(b)) if the channel gain (LdB(k, ??(b))) is within ?L dB range from the maximum channel gain (maxj?[1,nB ] LdB(k, j)). That is: For b = 1 : nB , ?k = ??(b) if LdB(k, ??(b)) ? maxj?[1,nB ] LdB(k, j) &gt; DeltaL. In this way, we give priority to base station on the top of the permuta- tion list ??.

5 Numerical Results and Discussions In this section, we compare the system performance of the greedy macroscopic scheduler versus the conventional camp-on-the- strongest-cell approach with respect to the maximal throughput and the proportional fair utility functions. The set of simulation param- eters is illustrated in table 1.

Mobile users are distributed randomly on the coverage area served by nB base stations. From figure 3(a), we observe that significant gain in total system capacity (relative to the camp-on-the- strongest-cell baseline) can be achieved at various nR = (1, 2, 4).

For example, there are 3.5, 3.8 and 4.3 times of total system capac- ity gain at nR = 1, 2, 4 respectively. The significant gain is due to the presence of multi-user detection and interference cancellation capability at the base station.

users to one base station even if the user is closer to another base sta- tion (unless the user is very far away from the base station) because interference cancellation could be effective only for users associated with the base station. This is illustrated in figure 4.

Figure 3(b) highlights the corresponding gain for proportional fair utility function at nR = 1, 2, 4. Similarly, significant gains are ob- served at all nR.

6 Conclusions In this paper, we consider a generic multi-cell system with K client users (each with single antenna), nB base stations (each with nR an- tennas and multiuser detector) and a centralized controller. At any time, a user could be associated with one base station only. Encod- ing and decoding terminates at the base station level. The problem is to find the optimal dynamic user association with the nB base Figure 4: Illustration of the advantage to associate users with one base station. It is better to associate mobile 1, 2, 3 to base station A (even if mobile 3 is closer to base station B). On the other hand, mobile 4 should be associated with base station B because it is very close to the base station.

stations such that the system performance is optimized. We pro- posed an analytical framework for the above macroscopic schedul- ing problem and introduce a greedy sub-optimal solution. We show that when multi-user detection is incorporated in base stations, the conventional camp-on-the-strongest-cell approach is far from opti- mal. For example, we illustrated that there are 4 time of throughput gain between the proposed greedy algorithm and the conventional algorithm at various nR. This is because with multi-user detection, it is advantageous to associate users to a common base station due to interference cancellation unless the user is very far away from the base station. We found that the scheduling gain increases with de- creasing path loss exponent because of the increase in the effective overlapping area between cells.
