Abstract?Distributed applications are often faced with a choice between improved throughput or improved reliability but not both. We argue that this is not a strict dichotomy and propose a framework that improves both application performance and reliability by adaptively adjusting source and channel coding parameters. For simplicity, we assume that the source and channel we work with are memoryless and in general behave in a way such that Shannon's separation theorem holds. Although not all sources and channels could be characterized as such, doing so allows us to work this resource allocation problem in parallel. We reduce redundant transmissions and minimize bandwidth utilization through an LZ77 style dictionary based source coding approach. To ensure data integrity, we apply rateless forward error correction techniques at the transport layer.
