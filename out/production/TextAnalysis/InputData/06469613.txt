Prediction of Protein Disordered Regions in A Protein  Sequence Based on Gap-constraint Subsequence

Abstract? The disordered region is an important protein structure which contains much information about protein function. Until now, the prediction of protein disordered region is also much popular task. In this paper, we proposed a new approach to predict protein disordered regions in a protein sequence using the gap-constraint subsequence patterns mining and association rule mining. At first, the gap-constraint frequent subsequences are generated by Gap-BIDE algorithm in two classes, disordered sequence and ordered sequence. Based on these frequent subsequences, we calculated the conditional probability of disordered subsequence patterns in both classes and classify the candidates into the class which has the higher conditional probability. Finally, we used the disordered/ordered subsequence patterns which we generate to search the disordered regions in a protein sequence. In the experiment, we used the CASP 9 and Disprot 5.7 dataset as test data and the performance is higher than other methods.

I.  INTRODUCTION Disordered proteins, referred to as naturally unfolded  proteins or intrinsically unstructured proteins are characterized by the lack of stable tertiary structure when the protein exists as an isolated polypeptide chain under physiological conditions in vitro. However, all protein analyses are based on protein primary structure denoted amino acid sequences. Protein sequences determine the protein structure, and protein structures are concerned with the protein function. In the study of protein structures, predicting a disordered region in a protein sequence is an issue. The reasons are as follows: 1), the proteins could function when protein disordered sequences fold with other protein sequences. So, finding the protein disordered region helps the study of protein functions. Moreover, most hub_proteins cannot highly interact with proteins than non hub proteins [1] (disordered proteins) except cancer proteins [2]. 2), when we analyzed the similarity between proteins by protein alignments, the identification of disordered region could help to avoid that disordered region compared with ordered region and then improved the accuracy of analysis.

Until now, a number of predictors of protein disordered regions have been published. From the view of algorithms, which were used to construct the prediction model, several data  mining and machine learning algorithms were applied, such as support vector machines (SVMs), neural network (NN) or artificial neural network (ANN), regression, bayesian markov chain model, random forest, sliding window and so on. SVM and NN are the more popular algorithms than the others. The published predictors that used SVM to predict disordered regions are DISPRED2 [3], VSL2 [4], SPRITZ [5], POODLE_L [6], and MFDp [7]. The predictors that include RONN [8], PONDR [9], NORSp [10], VL3 [11], DisEMBL [12], DISOPRED [13] and DISpro [14] are constructed by NN.

Regression was also used to build prediction models, VL2 [15] and VSL1 [16].In addition, FoldIndex [17] applied sliding window. DRaai-L and DRaai-s [18] used random forest to build the prediction model. In 2008, Alla Bulashevska applied Bayesian markov chain model to predict disordered regions [19].

From the view of protein properties, many protein properties were used to study protein disordered regions, for example, low hydrophobicity, the content of B-factor (residues with high B-factor loops)[20], position-specific score [21], high net charge and low hydrophobicity  [17], low contact density (average amino acid contact propensity scores with or without pairwise interaction energy matrices)[22] and so on. More recently, two predictors: DRaai-L and DRaai-S [18] which are based on the profiles of amino acid indices representing various physiochemical and biochemical properties of the 20 amino acids have been proposed. DISOclust[23] used a method that is different from the other method based on the analysis of 3- dimantional structural models using ModFOLDclust[24].

In addition, to increase the accuracy of prediction, several meta-predictors such as MD [25], metaPrDOS [26], MFDp and PONDR-FIT [27] are developed, which are combined by several predictors. Besides these methods, multiple sequence alignment with proteins of known protein domains is used to analyze protein structures.

Sequence data has been used to analyze protein structure, the sequential pattern mining is applied and discovering the sequential pattern mining is a way to extract frequents subsequence from a sequence data set.

According to the characteristics of disordered proteins, the predicted regions that are predicted are different from each other [28]. However, all protein disordered region predictors     applied characteristics of disordered proteins to identify the disordered region in a protein sequence. So, in this study, a novel approach is proposed, and it does not apply the characteristics of disordered protein. In this paper, we generate the gap constraint closed protein sequence patterns using Gap- BIDE algorithm [29], and we also applied the conditional probability of the association rule mining to classify the protein disordered/ordered subsequence pattern candidates into the right class. We use the gap constrained frequent pattern to get more information. We also applied the conditional probability to select the distinguishable sequence patterns.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the generation method of the gap-constrain frequent subsequence. Section 3 and Section 4 show the generation process of disordered/ordered subsequence patterns and how to use these patterns to predict the disordered regions in a protein sequence. In Section 5, the experimental results and the performance of the approach are represented. Finally, we give some concluding remarks in Section 6.



II. PROTEIN GAP-CONSTRAINT FREQUENT SUBSEQUENCE GENERATION USING GAP-BIDE ALGORITHM  To predict the disordered regions in protein sequences, we also need to extract the patterns which can distinguish the disordered regions in protein sequences. Frequent disordered sequence is a kind of disordered protein sequence pattern which occurs frequently in disordered sequences. The occurrence probability of a frequent disordered subsequence is higher than the sequences which occur infrequently in disordered sequences.

In this section, we used the Gap-BIDE algorithm to extract the candidate patterns. Gap-BIDE algorithm is proposed which is used to generated gap constrained closed patterns.

Comparing with the original frequent pattern, gap constrained frequent pattern contain much more information. Because we can find that gaps exist when we alignment the protein sequences. However, the original frequent protein sequences can?t extract the patterns which are not continued amino acid patterns.

Because of the usage of the Gap-BIDE algorithm to generate the gap-constraint frequent patterns, three problems are solved. It finds out more information, but also solves the input data problem of Bayesian network. It is difficult to use all the protein sequence data directly, if we use the conditional probability of subsequence patterns applied to analysis sequence data. Because some protein patterns frequently occur in a protein sequence, and it can?t be considered. Except this, it extracts the useful information, but also reduces the size of the dataset.



III. GENERATION OF PROTEIN DISORDERED SUBSEQUENCE PATTERNS USING ASSOCIATION RULE MINING  In protein sequences, the occurrence possibility of a disordered frequent subsequence is higher than the subsequence which occurs infrequently in disordered regions.

However, it is difficult to determine that a subsequence which occurs frequently in the disordered sequences always represents disordered region in each sequence. To select more distinguishable patterns, we applied the probability concept to analyze.

The process is as follows:  ? To generate the candidates of protein patterns, all possible protein subsequences are combined by 20 amino acids.

? The support of all disordered/ordered subsequence pattern candidates are counted and made a subsequence data support list for every protein pattern candidate in two classes, disordered and ordered region respectively.

? The conditional probability is calculated based on data support list.

? The patterns are classified into the class c1 which conditional probability of a pattern in a class c1 is larger than in the other class c2, the pattern is classified to this class c1.

In this section, we used protein gap-constraint frequent patterns to construct protein subsequence classification model.

After constructing protein subsequence data support list of each protein candidate with their next amino acids, we calculated the conditional probabilities of each protein subsequence candidate in relation to the next amino acids based on the data support list.

The conditional probabilities of the protein subsequence candidate s= a1, a2,?an of in relation to the next amino acid an+1 are calculated by the following formula:   )...,(  ),...,()...,(   nC  nnC nnC aaaP  aaaaPaaaaP ++ = . (1)  To classify the protein candidates, we calculate the conditional probabilities for disordered data as a value describing the conditional probability of a subsequence to be disordered and then use the standard decision rule to come up with a discrete output, i.e. predict one of the two classes (disordered/ordered) showing the biggest conditional probability.

In the example, we can get the conditional probability of disorder pattern candidate ?PA? is PC(A|P)=PC(PA)/PC(P)=3/5 (Fig.1). If the conditional probability of this candidate pattern in class ordered protein is higher than in class disordered protein, the candidate ?PA? is classified in to ordered subsequence pattern.



IV. SEARCH FOR THE RROTEIN DISORDERED REGION In this paper, the method is based on discovering the  disordered / ordered region via scanning the extracted protein disordered / ordered patterns using the sliding window technique in protein sequences and matching the right region as disordered / ordered regions.



V. EXPERIMENT AND RESULT  A. Dataset In this study, the training data is extracted from DisProt  (version 5.7, http://www.disprot.org/) and PDB (Protein Data Bank). DisProt is a collection of disordered regions of proteins based on published literature descriptions. The PDB sequences were filtered using the culled PDB list to extract a high-quality and low-sequence identity subset.

It has 643 protein entries and 1375 disordered regions. The ordered training data is extracted from PDB-Select-25, a representative set of protein data bank (PDB) chains that show less than 25% sequence homology. This collection of ordered training set includes a total of 68132 residues. The CASP 9 targets were used as an independent test dataset to blind test performance of prediction. In this work, we use the 50% sample data of CASP 9 and 10% sample data of Disprot 5.7 for test data.?  B. The Result of Disordered Subsequence Patterns The features used to predict the disordered regions include:  protein disordered subsequence patterns and ordered subsequence patterns are generated by gap-constraint frequent sequence pattern mining and conditional probability of association rule mining. Table 1 and Table 2 show a sample of the disordered / ordered subsequence patterns generated. Here disordered / ordered subsequence pattern means the pattern occurs frequently in disordered / ordered region and every amino acid combination is based on conditional probability in the disordered / ordered patterns.

high. In this experiment, we just compare with the predictors that apply the one property of disordered regions, and we get the higher accuracy. Some papers proposed that sensitivity was the most important performance measures for the disordered region predictor. Further, if we change the parameters, then the specificity of our proposed predictor also could get to 81% and the accuracy is 67.5%. It means that we can control the value of the parameters to get the necessary results.



VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we proposed a simple approach of protein  disordered region prediction based on gap-constraint frequent sequence mining and association rule mining. Firstly, we used the Gap-BIDE algorithm to generate the gap-constraint frequent subsequences. Next, we calculated the conditional probability of all the possible disordered/ordered subsequence pattern candidates in both classes respectively and classified the candidates into the class which conditional probability is higher than in the other class. Finally, we used the sliding window method to search all disordered/ordered subsequence patterns in the protein sequence and match the right region as disordered regions. In the experiment, the accuracy of this approach is 70.4%.
