Improving The Quality of Graduate Education by Association rules Analysis

Abstract   One of the main concerns of higher educational  system is evaluating and enhancing the quality of education. In This paper, We study the application of the Association rules Analysis in the curricula of graduate education. Besides the support and confidence, we introduce the Interestingness to decrease the useless rules. At last, give an example of its application in graduate education data.

1 Introduction   The graduate education is one of the most important part of the national education system, it?s the backbone of national competitiveness and innovation. Although graduate education in China does not enjoy a long history with its newly settlement , it has made great progress with the setting up of new disciplines, the grand scale of the enrollment of graduates, the improving of the working conditions of students in the laboratories and the up-grading of teaching . As a result, many new disciplines of international recognition have been set up and numerous excellent graduates have been trained. And it will be further developed at a relatively high speed with the spread of the popularity of higher education. The employment of the information technology into the graduate education is also developed quickly. In fact we have gone through three stages of development in the establishment of GEMIS (Graduate Education Management Information  System) from setting up the GEMIS based on single computer at the earliest stage to based on LAN?and to based on campus Intranet[2]. At later stages, in order to build up GEMIS, great efforts and a large sum of money have been spent to build many information systems which have proved to be useful in increasing efficiency of clerks in the administrative departments for graduates in each university and in accumulating a lot of important data. Based on the principle and methodology of data mining, this paper will explore the data accumulated in the graduate education of University of Defense and Technology provide an effective data analysis method , thus giving decision-making to the making and adjustment of training plan and the evaluation system for graduates.

2 Interestingness of Association Rules in Data Mining   The propose of the association rules analysis is to mine the association rules hidden in the data. Such rules are used to uncover the condition for the attributes and attribute values happened at the same time in the data set. In fact, by mining the association rules, we first find out the frequent item sets with the smallest support appointed by user in the transaction data D. Then we decide the rules to be taken in terms of the smallest confidence appointed by user in the frequent item sets. Finally we decide the association rules.  In order to explain it more clearly , it is a expression like X?Y,X?Y??.The degree of the strength of the association rules is measured by their   DOI 10.1109/FSKD.2008.317       support and confidence. We have the following formula?let N be the whole number of transaction D, let ?(X) be the number of transaction in which X occurs, so do with ? (Y),let P(X) be the probability of X occurs, P(X)=?(X)/N, so do with P(Y), P(Y)=?(Y)/N, let P(XY) be the probability of X and Y occurs at the same time, P(XY)=?(XY)/N, then the support and confidence is  support :s(X?Y)=?(XY)/N (1)  confidence: c(X?Y)=?(XY)/?(X) (2)  We choose the rules satisfy both a minimum  support threshold and minimum confidence  threshold and make use of it. The apriori  arithmetic is the first arithmetic for mining  association rules. It uses the technology of pruning for the first time, and control the amount of candidate generation.

But in practice, we found that it is not enough  for association rules analysis only consider the support and confidence. The amount of rules is  so high, some rules is irrationality. This will  result in more analysis workload, some rules are misadvised, and it can?t make out the direction of then relationship. For example ,in the test degree of system engineering specialty, 40 percent of students ' s multimedia technology degree is B  + ,and the most  of student?s teaching practice degree is B+. In the arithmetic only consider the support and confidence, these two courses is associated. But obviously, the rule is useless. So it?s necessary to introduce other measurement to decrease the useless rules, the Interestingness is an effective measurement[1-2].

Interestingness:  )()( )(Y)interest(X YPXP  XYP=?  (3)  The Interestingness represent the ratio  between the probability of Y in the condition  of X and the probability of Y didn?t consider X ,it can exactly reflect the  relationship  between X and Y.If interestingness equal to 1,shows that X and Y is happened independently,  they haven?t relationship, the rule is useless. If Interestingness is bigger than 1, it shows that  the probability of Y in the condition of X is  bigger than the probability of Y didn?t consider X, in the other words, X impulse Y, the rules  is useful, the relationship is positive. In contrast, If Interestingness is less than 1, it shows that X decrease the probability of Y, the rules is useful, the relationship is negative.

3 Association Analysis in Graduate Education  3.1 Data Model   According to the characteristic of the graduate education data that most of the data is structural, we select the star data structure.

Fig.1  Structure of Graduate Education Data   3.2 Data Preprocessing   Data Preprocessing is very important in data mining, it include data cleaning up, data integration, data transformation and data reduction. In graduate education, the data preprocessing include work as fellow.

The data of one's status as a student One's status as a student include name ,sex ,native  place ,major ,folk and so on .According to the training plan of our school ,we select the students be enrolled in between  2002 and 2007,and transfer the continuous data to discrete data.

The course test degree data First we transfer the score to degree like  A,B+,B,C+,C,D+,D and E to 1,2,3,4,5,6,7and 8.Then we calculate the Grade Integrate Evaluate Value(GIEV) of the whole course for each student.

Let n be the number of students of a course .One student?s degree is R1,let x 1 is his point value ,and  x 2??? x n to other students.

__ x  is defined as     __  ? ++=  n xxx n  (4)  Let y be this student?s windage of the course, y is defined  as  ? ? ?  ?? ?  ?  >?  ?++?  ???  ??  = 5),2(~  )()(  *)2)(1(  5,5.2     nnt  xxxx  xx n  nn  nx  y  n  (5)  Let m be the number of the course for this student ,the point value of each is y1?y2???ym .The number of students of each course is n1,n2,?,nm .Let  i?  be the credit hour of each course, * iy  is defined  as   ? ?  ? ?  ?  > ? ?  ? =  5,  5, *  ii i  i  ii  i ny n n  ny y  (6)     *     1GIEV ii m  i m  i i  y?= ? ? =  =  ? ?  (7)  GISV is continuous ,we should transfer it to discrete.

The thesis evaluation data Like the GIEV ,we should calculate the Thesis  Integrate Evaluate Value(TIEV) each student(omit).

3.3 Association Rules Mining   In the following, we select the students from  system engineering specialty and enrolled in between 2002 and 2007 to introduce the procedure of Association Rules Mining in graduate education.

Table 1 Data Transformation  ID COURSE DEGREE  16500 C-18 3  16500 C-13 4  16500 C-34 5  16500 C-14 4  16500 C-55 1  16500 C-28 4  16500 C-30 6  ? ? ?   Data Transfo rmation  ID C-49 C-10 C-13 16433 1  1 16434 2  3 16435 1  5 16436 1  2 16437 2 7 1 16438 3  1 16439 1 2 1  ? ? ? ?  Choose apriori arithmetic to execute on this data ,we can have the result.

Table 2  Data Ming Result  ID Rules?didn?t use Interestingness?  Rules?use Interestingness?  C-30=7 11 ==> C-11=4  C-16=2  => C-51=3  C-34=7 11 ==> C_11=4 C-30=3 6  C-10=2  => C-13=2  3 C-16=2  => C-51=3 C-16=1 =>C-32=1 4 C-10=2  => C-13=2 C-53=3 => C-13=1 5 C-16=1 => C-32=1 C-13=3 => C-20=3       6 C-53=3 => C-13=1 C-16=2 => C-20=5 7 ? ?   3.4 The Result Analysis  In the process of data mining, we think that  it is difficult to define the minimum support  threshold and minimum confidence threshold, so  we list all the rules order by the support and  confidence. If we needed, we can choose the  rules from strong to weak and make use of  it .After investigate the mining result, we can  find that if we use Interestingness measure,  some rules like C-30=7 11 ==> C-11=4 6 are filtrated. Because all of the degree of C-30 is 3, so this rule is useless.

Through Discovering knowledge from large databases of course test grade records, it can discover the relationship between courses,which can Assist in developing new curricula,or improving existing curricula.

4 Conclusion   With the development of digital campus, the technology of data mining will be implemented in the educational management to make use of the useful knowledge and ?data? , thus helping to make efficient policy and further development of graduate education, and improving the quality of it.
