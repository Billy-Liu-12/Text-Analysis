Semi-Automated Lifestyle Manager for Obesity

Abstract?Existing healthcare services on smartphones are not convenient to use as they typically require too many manual inputs from users. This paper presents a semi-automated obesity- care application for helping people manage their own lifestyles.

In our approach, a person?s lifestyle is captured by a log of daily activities performed (e.g., eating, visiting, etc.), which can be captured automatically. For this purpose, the application recognizes the current location of the user and logs the history of his/her visiting places over time. This log can be used to deduce the type and the duration of the user?s activities and then the calorie consumption. The application also helps the user aware of his/her own lifestyle and BMI changes, and records this information for future usage such as when meeting a doctor for a clinical purpose. We have implemented the application on the Android platform and demonstrate the usefulness of this approach by illustrating the screen designs.

I.  INTRODUCTION Sedentary life-style can make people fat and unhealthy, and  we need ways to help people aware of their own life-style [1-5].

There exist healthcare services targeting obesity, based on life- logging on mobile devices [6, 7]. An obesity-care service typically requires calorie intake and consumption, asking users for manual input and creating inconvenience to the users.

This paper presents an obesity-care application for smartphones. Our contribution can be summarized twofold.

First, the application recognizes the current location of a user and logs the history of his/her visiting places over time. The log can deduce the type and the duration of the user?s activities and then the calorie consumption, based on the assumption that human activities are related to the visiting places. Second, the application helps the user aware of his/her own lifestyle and BMI changes, and records this information for future usage such as when meeting a doctor for a clinical purpose.



II. SEMI-AUTOMATED LIFESTYLE MANAGER  A. Semi-Automated Activity Logging The proposed obesity-care application was motivated from the idea that our activities may be highly related to where we  are. For example, we eat something in a restaurant, rather than and playing soccer. The application can recognize the current location of a user and log the history of his/her visiting places over time. This log of information can be used to deduce the type and the duration of the user?s activities.

Activity log is defined as Audt = {u, vudt, audt, iudt}, where u is user, d date, t time, v visiting place, a activity of the user, and i additional information. In our implementation, place information is obtained automatically using the Wifi-sensor technique. Additional information is any other information for the log. Consider the following record, for example:  BAdt = {A, restaurant HanKook, eat, rice(1) + gimchi(1) + pork(1), d = 2013/08/15, t = 08:05-08:46}   which represents ?user A had breakfast with rice, gimchi, and pork at the restaurant ?HanKook? on August 15, 2013.

Additional information in this example is the list of the consumed dishes from the user manually. Lifestyle of a user is modeled as a collection of activity logs over a certain period.

BMI log is simply a list of BMI records for a user. Our application stores the BMI logs as well as the lifestyle logs for all users registered.

Fig. 1 also shows the workflow of which a basic scenario as follows: after the basic login process, the user registers new places so that they can be recognized by the system from the This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government(MSIP) (No. 2010-0028631).

next visit. This information will be used by the system for all registered users. The user can also provide more detailed activity description manually. On the other hand, the BMI log is totally maintained manually, several times per day. The system maintains the lifestyle and the BMI logs for each user, and provides various services such as lifestyle analysis or clinical advice.



III. IMPLEMENTATION  A. Registration of Users and Places Lifestyle Manager is implemented on the Android platform.

Fig. 2 illustrates some sample screens: (a) a user registration or login screen; (b) a main screen showing the recognized current place and surrounding Wifi signals; (c) a place registration screen.

B. Management of User Activities The user activities can be determined in a hierarchical way,  helping the process of inputting additional information easier.

For example, an activity can be set as ?h1 = eat, h2 = Korean- style restaurant?, where hn is the nth depth of the activity hierarchy. If the current place happens to be a Korean-style restaurant, the system will provide the user with a list of Korean-style dishes. Fig. 2(d) shows a screen of activity logs, where each row represents an activity log. Fig. 2(e) shows a screen for the user to input additional activities such as various exercises. Fig. 2(f) shows a screen showing the results of the recorded lifestyle and the BMI logs.

The result graph illustrated in Fig. 2(f) shows the statistics per month, but results for any designated periods will also be drawn. From these results, the user can self-check how much times he/she spent for which activities, or may present the information to doctors or nurses for various clinical purposes.

The result screen provides three kinds of results: activities, BMI, and calories consumed.

The activity hierarchy implemented at the writing of this paper covers only those which one can perform within the KAIST campus for experimental purposes, as illustrated in Fig.

3. For the sake of simplicity, the depth of the hierarchy is shown to be two, where the activities defined at depth 2 exhibit about calorie intakes since the current application aims for managing obesity.

IV. CONCLUSION This paper has presented our on-going work on an obesity-  care application for smartphones. Existing healthcare services on smartphones are not convenient to use as they typically require too many manual inputs from users. Our proposed application has Lifestyle Manager which helps the user manage the health-related information in a semi-automated fashion by recognizing the visiting places automatically and deducing the types of the activities, and allowing the user to augment the information by providing any additional input in a convenient way. For demonstration, we have implemented the application and conducted an experiment within the KAIST campus, targeting obesity. Additional services for diabetes and dementia will also be developed in the near future.
