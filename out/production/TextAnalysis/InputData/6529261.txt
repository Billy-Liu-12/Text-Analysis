Keynote I

Abstract The IT industry has seen a significant shift in spending towards cloud-based services, with concepts such  as IaaS and PaaS becoming nearly ubiquitous. In the process, the software management stacks for running clouds have become increasingly automated and virtualized. The next step in this evolution is what we are referring to as Software Defined Environment (SDE), in which infrastructure elements such as storage and networking become further virtualized and leverage advances in switching technology, ethernet convergence, etc. Projects such as OpenStack Quantum are helping to abstract and virtualize these infrastructure elements so that individual workloads can be more intelligently assigned the resources they need -- an important improvement given the intensity of workloads such as Big Data that must be supported by clouds. In this talk we will talk about the trend in Cloud Computing towards SDE-based infrastructure in the industry and areas where contributions from the research community will be needed.

We will also discuss how IBM and its Research division are looking to leverage these capabilities in offerings coming to market in the next 12-18 months.

Speaker Bio  Dennis Quan is Vice President of SmartCloud Enterprise, responsible end-to-end for IBM's SmartCloud Enterprise public cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) deployed worldwide. Dennis's involvement in Cloud Computing started in 2007, when his team built IBM's first cloud in collaboration with Google and the National Science Foundation. He has held numerous technical leadership positions in IBM over the past 14 years, including most recently as lab director of the IBM Tivoli China Development Laboratory in Beijing/Shanghai/Taipei, where he worked extensively with clients in the Greater China region across various industries on Cloud Computing and Integrated Service Management projects. Dennis holds a Ph.D.

in Computer Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as well as bachelor's degrees in Mathematics and Chemistry, also from MIT.
