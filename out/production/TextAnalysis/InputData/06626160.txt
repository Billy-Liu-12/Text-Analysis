Mining Spatial Association Rules from LBS

Abstract?With the development of Location-Based Services  system (LBS), privacy protection of LBS is becoming a hotspot  topic in GIS and mobile communication domains. Among series  of LBS users? privacies protection techniques, Spatial-Temporal  K-Anonymity has become a prominent method for its easy  implementation and extension. While, this method and its  variants suffer from a common drawback that they decrease  utilization of LBS anonymity datasets because of adopting the  common principle that reduces spatial temporal resolution of  LBS query. However, improving utilization of LBS anonymity  datasets is very important for LBS providers. The reason is that  it can benefit for many LBS applications. In this paper, we  format basic concepts of mining spatial association rules from  LBS anonymity datasets and design the implemented algorithms.

In experiments we present the detailed process of mining spatial  association rules which includes three phases: generating LBS  anonymity datasets by adopting Spatial-Temporal K-Anonymity  to GPS trajectories; preprocessing LBS anonymity datasets by  spatial joining with geographic background GIS layers to achieve  a spatial transaction database; mining spatial association rules  from the spatial transaction database by adopting the proposed  method. The experimental results show that utilization of the  mined spatial association rules can assist intelligent traffic  management.

I.  INTRODUCTION  In recent years, the escalating development of mobile communication and GPS receivers technology has triggered LBS, which emerges as a new research direction in mobile communication and GIS communities[1][2]. However, without strict safeguards, the deployment of LBS poses a severe threat to user privacy, such as the disclosure and illegal use of LBS query datasets, which has attracted the extensive interest of academia and the industry[3][4].

In early days, research of LBS users? privacies protection mainly focused on establishing the specifications and laws.

However, these methods are lack of flexibility and always lag behind the attack technologies. Then, A series of algorithms of LBS users? privacies are proposed by researchers, such as, dummies [5], spatial transformation based on Hilbert curve [6] and PIR [7] , etc. While, Spatial-Temporal K-Anonymity [8], which was proposed by Gruteser, M. and Grunwald, D. in 2003, has become a prominent approach of LBS users? privacies  protection techniques because of its easy implementation and extension. Spatial-Temporal K-Anonymity, as an extension of the K-anonymity model, adopts the basic principle that LBS requesters do not submit to LBS servers their accurate spatial- temporal information anymore, instead of anonymity datasets which are made up of spatial-temporal adjacent k users, by which to achieve a guarantee to LBS users? location privacies and identify privacies. This basic idea of Spatial-Temporal K- Anonymity  has inspired a series of its variants research publications, which are mainly applied in LBS snapshot queries and continuous queries. The former variants methods include enhanced privacy protection of query identify [9], flexibly setting the privacy protection level[10], privacy protection in multi-mode query[11], privacy protection in spatial network[12] and distributed sensing network[13], and the later variants methods are Memorization, plain KAA, Advance KAA [14] and the prediction method based on movement model [15].

However, Spatial-Temporal K-Anonymity and its variants suffer from a common drawback that they reduce the resolution of location information, hence, may decrease the utilization of LBS anonymity datasets. The literature related to analyze the utilization of LBS anonymity datasets is not appeared so far.

While, how to improve the utilization of LBS anonymity datasets is precisely important for the LBS providers. The reason is that analyzing LBS anonymity datasets by taking advantages of data mining tools can enhance the process of decision making regarding tasks such as, urban planning, routing, intelligent navigation systems, personalized service systems, etc, which can make a great profit for the LBS providers. In this paper, we mainly focus on mining spatial association rules from LBS anonymity datasets and how the mining results help to analyze urban traffic information.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we describe the basic concept of spatial association rules mining and formats the method of mining spatial association rules from LBS anonymity datasets. Experiments and results on this method are described in Section 3. And we conclude in Section 4 with a summary and direction for the future work.



II. THE PROPOSED DATA MINNING METHOD  A. Basic Concepts  An anonymity dataset (  ) includes cloaking region (  ), anonymous users? identification set (UIDs) whose locations are in cloaking region (  ), the periods (  ) of the query duration.

Then, . All the basic units are organized in a three-level hierarchy expressing the relationship of the units, which are presented in Figure 1.

<AS>  <CR>  <UIDs>  <Ps>  <Cell1> <Celli>  <Cellm> <U1>  <Ui>  <Uk>  <P1>  <Pi>  <Pk>   Figure 1.  Three-level hierarchy expressing the relationship of LBS anonymity dataset?s units  Definition1: The layer                           ,  which includes the anonymity dataset (  ) and is chosen as the target layer, where            is the instance in the target  layer. CR of an AS, which unions several Cells, is stored as  geometry shape of       , and      and   are stored as  categorical attribute.

Definition2: The set of geographic background layer  are chosen as the relevant layers,  where                      ,               and  is an instance in the relevant layer    .

Definition3:  The spatial relationships              is  computed by spatially comparison the instance       and the  instance    .The set of spatial relationships  are computed by spatially comparison all instances     in       and all instances     in     , for all  in   .

Definition4: The row  is the spatial relationship which is organized in  a relational table.

Definition5:   All the rows which contain the same element  are combined to form a spatial transaction  .

The prefixes                             are added  because attributes with same names are not allowed in the same  transaction. In order to improve the efficiency of data mining,  spatial transaction is recombined at feature type granularity  levels [16], definitions are as follows:  Definition6:   The  row  is the spatial relationship which is organized in a  relation table.

Definition7:   All the rows which contain the same  element ???? ?? are combined to form a  transaction ??? ???? ???? ?? ??  ????    ??  ????        ??? ????  ?  .

Similar to ??? , the prefixs ??  ????  ??  ????      ??? ????   are added because  attributes with same names are not allowed in the same  transaction.

Definition8:  Let ?   ???  ????  ???  ????  ???? ????   be a spatial transaction database, and ?  ??  ????    ??  ????        ??? ????  ?   is the  spatial itemsets of all the spatial transactions in ?.

In particular, the spatial itemsets ? are determined by each  layer      spatial join the set of relevant layers ?? ??  ???      ???  .Any subset X of I is included in D. If  ,   is called a k spatial itemsets. If     ???? ????  , we say  that  ???? ???? contains  .

The count transactions, which are in   and contain  , is defined as the support count of     and denoted as    .

Accordingly, the support of   is denoted as           , whose formula is as follow:  ??????? ??  ? ?  00%                         (1)  If the        ?    is greater than the threshold specified by users,   is called an frequent spatial itemset.

Definition9:  For any of spatial itemsets   and ?, if  ? ?  ?, the formula  ? ? is called a spatial association rule of   (antecedent) and ? (consequent). The support of   ? ? is that of     , which is denoted as          ?    and formulated as follow:  ??????  ? ?    ??????   ?                 (2) Definition10:   the confidence degree of  ? ? is denoted  as ??????????   ? ? , whose formula is as follow:  ??????????? ? ?? ????????? ??  ?????????? ?  00%       (3)  If          ?            and            ? ? ?          , the association rule  ?   is called as a strong association rule; Otherwise it is a weak one.

B. Approach of Mining Spatial Association Rules  Inspired by the approach of mining association rules from a transactional dataset introduced by Agrawal etc, Koperski and Han first investigated spatial association rules among a set of spatial and possibly some non-spatial predicates, i.e.   ?         ?        %  %  where at least one of the predicates                     is a spatial predicate,  % and  % is the support and confidence of the rule, respectively [17].

In fact, spatial predicates describe spatial relationships of objects in spatial datasets. There are basically 3 spatial relationships to consider: topological, distance and direction [18].Topological relationships characterize the type of intersection between two spatial features and they can be classified into Equal, Disjoint, Touches, Within, Overlaps, Crosses, Contains and Covers. Distance relationships are based on the Euclidean distance between two spatial features.

Direction relationships deal with the order as spatial features are located in space. Limited by the space restrict of this paper, we mainly consider topological relationships to be as spatial predicates.

Unlike the traditional relationship in DBMS, spatial relationships are implicit and the methods of materializing this implicit information are required specifically. The typical mining spatial data association rules mainly include: the methods over layer based on clustering, the methods based on    spatial transactions and the method without spatial transactions.

Among them, the mining methods based on spatial transactions are the most popular [19]. There are four basic steps to implement the tasks of mining spatial association rules from spatial datasets organized as GIS layers:  (1) According to the specific mining object, it defines one (or a set of) GIS layer(s) as a target layer(s) and a set of GIS  layers as relevant layers.

(2) Based on the spatial relationships between a (or a set of) target layer(s) and a set of relevant layers, it formalizes  spatial predicates.

(3) By spatial join between the target layer(s) and each relevant layer, it performs computation of the spatial  relationships among the target layer(s) and each relevant  layer, which are firstly stored in relational tables and  finally transformed into a spatial transactions database.

(4) By adopting traditional Boolean association rules mining algorithms, it extracts all frequent spatial itemsets from  the spatial transactions database, and then generates  spatial association rules from the frequent spatial itemsets.



III. EXPERIMENTAL AND MINING RESULTS ANALYSIS  Experiments are performed on a 2.67GHz Intel(R) Core(TM) i5 CPU Tablet with 2.00GB main memory, running Microsoft Windows 7(R). Mapping display of spatial association rules is implemented in the VS2005 C# language and ESRI ArcMap.

A. Data Preparation  Original datasets of the experiments are GPS trajectories of 2,612 taxis in Nanjing on July 15th, 2007. Structure information of the GPS trajectories is sketched in TABLE I.

The ID represents the serial number of a GPS point in a GPS trajectory, DATE the record date of a GPS point, LONG the longitude value of a GPS point, LAT the latitude value of a GPS point, and SPEED represents the speed value of a GPS point.

Outline of this process is as follows:  (1) Preprocessing of GPS trajectories a) According to the spatial temporal distribution of  the 2,612 taxis GPS trajectories, we setup the  spatial and temporal resolution parameters,  which are shown in TABLE II and partition its  spatial-temporal domains into 12 periods and  10,000   00 ?  00  spatial temporal grids included in every period. The discrete spatial  temporal grids are sketched in Figure 2. (a).

b) For each period, we randomly sample 500 spatial-temporal grids which are simulated as  where and when the LBS anonymous requests  happen. The sampled spatial-temporal grids are  sketched in Figure 2.  (b).

(2) Generating of LBS anonymity datasets.

a) For each sampled spatial-temporal grid, we adopt  the Spatial-Temporal K-Anonymity algorithm to  generate a LBS anonymous dataset, which first  sums the anonymous users of the sampled  spatial-temporal grid, if the count is smaller than  k, it continues to search the adjacent spatial-  temporal grids by clockwise to include more  anonymous users, simultaneously, the LBS  request can be delayed for one period, if needed.

The parameters of the algorithm are shown in  TABLE II and the generated anonymous datasets  for one period are sketched in Figure 2. (c).

Basic information of 12 period?s anonymity  datasets generated is shown as 0  b) Translating the generated anonymous dataset of  12 periods to the 12 layers, which stores    as the geometry attribute and      and    as categorical attributes. The generated layers are  sketched in Figure 2. (d). Basic information of  12 periods layers are shown as 0  TABLE II.

Experiment Result  By spatial joining the 12 target layers and the 10 relevant layers, we get 16 spatial predicates which are shown in TABLE VI.  In order to improve performance of the spatial association rules mining algorithms, we code each spatial relationship with a unique ID. Then, we can obtain spatial transactions datasets sketched as 0  TABLE VI.

The spatial association rules mined by the algorithms proposed by this paper include two categories: rules with high and          and rules with low        and high         . The former represents the patterns of popular activities, while the latter represents the patterns of specified people.

1) Rules with high  ???   and ????? We set        and         of the rules as 60% and 60%.

In order to interpret the rules well, IDs of spatial relationships are translated back. The mined rules are listed in TABLE IX which can be divided into three categories: both the antecedent and consequent of the rules include one spatial relationship, i.e.

rules 1~6; only the antecedent of the rules include two spatial relationships, i.e. rules 7~9; only the consequent of the rules include two spatial relationships, i.e. rules 10~12.

Mapping display of the mined spatial association rules are shown in Figure 4. The frequent1 layer includes the datasets of rules 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10,11and 12 in TABLE IX.  While the frequent2 layer includes the datasets of rules 5 and 6.It can be seen that both the layers can reflect clearly spatial distribution of generating LBS anonymity datasets shown as Figure 3.

2) Rules with low  ???   and high ????? The rules are called sporadic rules, which represent rare  cases that are scattered sporadically through the database but with high confidence of occurring together. The rules can indicate a rare but fatal pattern, i.e. the symptoms of a rare but fatal disease. In order to find the sporadic rules from our generated LBS anonymity datasets, we constraint the support threshold values into an interval range, i.e. [              ].

In this experiment, we set it as [0.1%, 5%] and set the confidence threshold values as 60%. The mined rules are shown in 0and their mapping display is shown as Fig.5.Similarly, the rules can be divided into three categories: both the antecedent and the consequent of the rules only include one spatial relationship, i.e. rules 1~6; only the antecedent of the rules include two spatial relationships, i.e.

rules 7~8; only the consequent of the rules include two spatial relationships, i.e. rules 9.

CONTAINS_roadnetworks  0. 53% 100%      It is well-known that         represents the minimum amount of evidence and         specifies how strong the implication of a rule must be to be considered valuable. Both the rules mentioned above have high        , then which can be interpreted as conditional expressions, i.e. the rule 7 in TABLE VIII which is expressed as follow:           It states that the LBS anonymity datasets that overlap main  residential areas and cross road networks will have (with confidence 99%) a great percentage of crossing first-class roads. The rule 9 in TABLE IV which is expressed as follow:           It means that if the places where the LBS anonymous  requests happen contain main roads, it will have (with confidence 100%) a great percentage of containing first-class roads and containing road networks.

Then, based on the rules, especially for the rules with low       , it can make predictions that LBS queries requested in a certain spatial area will have a high probability to happen in a specific time range. Through accurate prediction of LBS user movements, LBS providers can provide to LBS users with personalized services in an efficient manner, thus leading to an improvement in resource utilization and a reduction in the latency in accessing the resources. Another benefit of this prediction will be to help make decision of urban traffic flow guidance system.



IV. CONCLUSIONS  In this paper, Firstly, we raised the problem that Spatial- Temporal K-Anonymity and its variants suffer from a common drawback that they severely decrease utilization of LBS anonymity datasets. Secondly, we proposed the algorithms of mining spatial association rule from LBS anonymity dataset.

Finally, we performed the experiments that adopting the proposed algorithm to mine a series of spatial association rules and analyzed the experimental results with a visual form to help the analyst interpret them.

However, we also found that the experimental results can also bring about risks to LBS users? privacies, i.e. based on the rules, attackers can infer temporal information of the specific users, such as, entering into or departing from a privacy sensitive region (i.e. prohibited military zone, red light district etc). Even more serious, attackers can enforce precise privacy violation when some sporadic spatial association rules can be regarded as identifiers or qui-identifiers of specified LBS users for their low       . In the future, designing the algorithms  against the attacks mentioned above and achieving strictly LBS users? privacies protection are our important issues.
