CAPRE: A New Methodology for Product Recommendation

Abstract?Recommender systems can apply knowledge dis- covery techniques to the problem of making product rec- ommendations. This aims to establish a customer loyalty strategy and thus to optimize the customer life time value.

In this paper we propose CAPRE, a data-mining based methodology for recommender systems based on the analysis of turnover for customers of specific products. Contrary to classical recommender systems, CAPRE does not aspire to predict a customer?s behavior but to influence that behavior. By measuring the actionability and profitability of customers, we have the ability to focus on customers that can afford to spend larger sums of money in the target business. CAPRE aggregates rules to extract characteristic purchasing behaviors, and then analyzes the counter-examples to detect the most actionable and profitable customers. We measure the effectiveness of CAPRE by performing a cross-validation on the MovieLens benchmark.

The methodology is applied to over 10,000 individual cus- tomers and 100,000 products for the customer relationship management of VM Mate?riaux company, thus assisting the salespersons? objective to increase the customer value.

I. INTRODUCTION  In a world where the number of product and service  offers can be overwhelming, Recommender Systems (RS)  help customers find and evaluate products or services. RS  are software tools and techniques providing suggestions for  products to be use by a customer [1] [2]. They connect  customers with potential products to purchase by associ-  ating either the content of products or the opinions of  customers, or both. In recent years, RS have found numerous  applications in industry, especially in e-commerce. They  help to develop and maintain profitable relationships with  customers [3], for example through cross or up-selling.

With most RS, the recommendations depend on the prod-  ucts that are currently bought by the customer [4]. This  principle is perfectly appropriate to e-commerce websites,  where the customer is alone for driving the product explo-  ration. However, it is hardly adaptable to salespersons? visits  to customers. We propose to adopt a different strategy: when  salespersons visit customers, which product(s) can they  recommend to trigger purchasing? Contrary to classical RS,  our goal is not to predict customer behaviors but to influence  customer behaviors. Making such recommendations requires  (i) to identify characteristic purchasing behaviors, and (ii)  to apply them on customers while respecting their own  behaviors. This last point is crucial because the cost of  an inappropriate recommendation is higher in the case of  salespersons? visits than on e-commerce websites [5]. The  salespeople may even refuse to use the RS if they consider  the recommendations not sufficiently relevant [6].

In this paper, we propose CAPRE (Customer Actionability  and Profitability Recommendation), a new methodology for  recommender systems based on the analysis of turnover  for customers of specific products. More precisely, CAPRE  aggregates rules to extract characteristic purchasing behav-  iors, and then analyzes the counter-examples to detect the  most actionable and profitable customers. Recommendations  are made by targeting the actionable counter-examples with  the most profitable rules. Actually, we do not use rules  as naive implications of purchasing behaviors. We use the  rules as a model to detect counter-examples, i.e. customers  with deviant purchasing behaviors that have the potential  to spend larger sums of money in the target business. Our  methodology is applied over 10,000 customers and 100,000  products for the customer relationship management of VM  Mate?riaux.

A. Contributions of the Paper  The main contributions of this paper can be resumed as  follows:  ? We develop a new methodology for recommending  products from a turnover database.

? We propose a measure of actionability of the rec-  ommendations, based on the similarity between the  examples and counter-examples.

? We offer an original measure of the profitability of the  recommendations, based on criteria defined by experts.

? We apply CAPRE on an actual VM Mate?riaux trading  group database composed of more than 10,000 cus-  tomers and 100,000 products.

? We measure the effectiveness of our system on the  MovieLens benchmark with a cross-validation.

DOI 10.1109/ICDMW.2011.42     B. Organization  The rest of the paper is organized as follows: section II  presents a state of the art in the recommender systems  and rule mining fields. Then, section III discusses our  methodology CAPRE with the two measures of actionabil-  ity and profitability. We apply CAPRE in order to make  recommendations on an actual dataset of VM Mate?riaux  trading group1 in section IV. We analyze the effectiveness  of CAPRE in section V by performing a cross-validation on  the MovieLens benchmark. The final section concludes and  describes our future work.



II. RELATED WORK  The growth of Internet and the emergence of e-commerce  has led the development of RS [7]. These allow companies  to filter information, and recommend products to customers  according to their preferences. Recommend products and  services can enhance the relationship between customer and  seller, and thus increase profits [8]. Actually recommenda-  tion is not a new concept, it is already used on the Web  through movies, books and music. RS have become an  important research area since the appearance of the first  papers on collaborative filtering [7]. RS are doubly useful:  on one hand, they help customers filter through enormous  numbers of products, and focus on the few ones that match  their preferences; on the other hand, recommender systems  help companies increase their sales on the long tail.

Many techniques have been developed, and several clas-  sifications have been proposed [2]. Montaner et al. [9]  provide a taxonomy and classify existing RS applications to  specific application domains: entertainment (movies, music  and IPTV), content (personalized newspapers, Web pages, e-  learning applications and e-mail filters), e-commerce (prod-  ucts to purchase such as books, cameras, PCs, etc.) and  services (travel services, experts for consultation, houses to  rent, matchmaking services). Examples of such applications  include recommending books at Amazon.com, movies by  MovieLens or music by Yahoo! Music. Schafer et al. [10]  present a detailed classification of recommender systems in  e-commerce, and elucidate how they can be used to pro-  vide personalized service customer loyalty. RS are usually  classified into the following categories:  ? Content-based recommendations: the customer will be  recommended products similar to the ones the cus-  tomers preferred in the past;  ? Collaborative recommendations: the customer will be  recommended products that customers with similar  preferences and behaviors liked in the past;  ? Hybrid approaches: this approach combine collabora-  tive and content-based methods.

In the following subsections, we will focus on collaborative  filtering and rule mining for RS.

1http://www.vm-materiaux.com  A. Recommender Systems Based on Collaborative Filtering  Collaborative recommender systems [7] produce customer  specific recommendations of products based on patterns of  ratings or purchases without need for exogenous information  about either products or customers. In other words, the main  idea is to exploit information about the past behavior of an  existing customer for predicting which products the current  customer will most probably like or be interested in. These  types of systems are in widespread industrial use today, in  particular as a tool in online retail sites.

There have been many collaborative systems developed  in the academia and the industry. It can be argued that  the Grundy system [11] was the first recommender system,  which proposed using stereotypes as a mechanism for build-  ing models. Later on, the Tapestry system relied on each  customer to identify like-minded customers manually [12].

GroupLens, Video Recommender and Ringo use collabo-  rative filtering algorithms to automate prediction. In the  recommendation field, the difficulty to collect descriptions  customers and content is a recurrent problem.

B. Rule Mining for Recommender Systems  In the context of RS, a transaction could be viewed  as the set of all the previous ratings or purchases of a  customer. Association rules can be used to develop Top-  N recommendations for each customer depending on past  purchases. Frequently, products are sorted by the confidence  of the rules [13], using multi-level rules [14] or depending  on the antecedent length of rules [15].

Recently, rule mining has become a current application  of RS. Leung et al. [16] present a model based on fuzzy  rules by exploiting similarities in product taxonomies. Liu  et al. [17] propose to extract customer purchasing behaviors  using sequential rules. Finally, Smyth et al. [18] present two  different case studies using association rules for RS.



III. CAPRE METHODOLOGY  In this section, we propose CAPRE, a new methodology  to apply rules to recommendation systems. A real-world  application is presented in section IV. CAPRE is divided  into five steps (see figure 1).

Figure 1. The Five Key Steps of CAPRE     A. Purchasing Behavior Rule Mining  1) Data: Let C be the set of all customers {c1, c2, . . . cn} and P be the set of all products {p1, p2, . . .pm} that can be recommended. Let u be a utility function that measures  the usefulness of product p for customer c: {  u : P ? C ? R p, c ? u(p, c)  (1)  where R is a part of R, e.g. positive integers or numbers.

In our methodology, u concerns a target business and has  a financial meaning. For instance, it can be the turnover  of product p for customer c. The greater u(p, c), the more the purchase of p by c is profitable for the company. The  function u depends on customer transaction history and can  be materialized by a matrix customers ? products. This context is directly applicable in the usual framework of  rating datasets (see section V).

Then, we apply two transformations (see figure 2) on  the values of the utility function, to make the customers  commensurable and to extract rule behaviors on discretized  data.

u(p, c) u%(p, c) u?(p, c)  Utility fonction Normalization Discretization  Figure 2. Normalization and discretization of the utility function  ? The first step is to make the turnover of a customer  c comparable with another, regardless of their financial  potential. For each customer c, the sales are transformed  as a percentage of sales, representing the usefulness  ratio of a product p to a customer c.

{  u% : P ? C ? [0; 100 %]  p, c ? u%(p, c) (2)  with, u%(p, c) = u(p,c)? p?P  u(p,c)  ? The second step is to normalize the proportions  u%(p, c), that we denote u?(p, c), by taking into ac- count their distribution for each product. This nor-  malization results in a discretization of proportions in  several intervals ?1 < ?2 < . . . < ?t.

{  u? : P ? C ? U = {?1, ?2, . . . ?t} p, c ? u?(p, c)  (3)  The normalization and discretization depend on the ap-  plication. Each customer c ? C is described by various characteristic variables (numerical or categorical), such as  age, income, etc.

For example, the utility function u is the turnover of  customers for product families such as plaster, concrete,  etc. u?(p, c) = ?1 (respectively ?2 and ?3), means that the turnover of customer c for product p is low (respectively  medium and large). Each building contractor customer c  is described by characteristic variables composed of the  number of employees, the professional category, etc.

2) Mining Cohorts of Rules (step 1 on figure 1): We  apply an association rule mining algorithm [19] to extract  purchasing behavior rules of the form:  u?(pX , ?) = ?X , u ?(pY , ?) = ?Y , . . . ? u  ?(pZ , ?) = ?Z (4)  where ?i pi ? P and ?j ?j ? U . The examples of the rule are the customers who satisfy the antecedent and the  consequent (corresponding to the dots ? ? ? in (4)). By con- trast, counter-example customers satisfy the antecedent and  not the consequent2. Such a rule means that the customers  who satisfy the antecedent tend to satisfy the consequent. In  our methodology, as our goal is to make recommendations,  we use rules with only one product in the consequent. For  simplicity, we will denote u?(pX , c) = ?X by pX = ?X (where pX ? P and ?X ? U ). So, we denote the rules in (4) as follows:  pX = ?X , pY = ?Y . . . ? pZ = ?Z (5)  In the classical association rule terminology, pX = ?X is called an item. The set of rules is filtered by support and  confidence thresholds. The resulting ruleset is denoted R.

Given an item pX = ?X , a cohort is the set of all the rules in R concluding on this item:  Ct(pX = ?X) = {r ? R | consequent(r) = (pX = ?X)} (6)  R is partitioned into as many cohorts as consequents of rules.

For the cohorts to be robust, we retain only the cohorts  with a sufficient number of rules. The sets of examples  and counter-examples of the cohort, noted Ct+(pX = ?X) and Ct?(pX = ?X) are the union of the sets of examples and counter-examples of the rules respectively. Detecting  counter-examples provides us with a precise group of cus-  tomers who can theoretically allow the company to run at a  healthy profit.

The interest of the cohorts is to merge all the rules  which provide the same recommendation. By exploiting rule  redundancy, we are able to extract more robust purchasing  behavior models (with more examples). Given a cohort Ct,  a Ct-Recommendation is to propose the consequent of Ct  to a counter-example.

For example, let us consider the cohort Ct(Gravel = c) composed of two rules:  ? Cement = c AND Sand = c ? Gravel = c has 190 examples and 70 counter-examples.

? Sand = c AND Concrete Mixer = c ? Gravel = c has 135 examples and 40 counter-examples.

The Ct-recommendation consists in proposing some gravel  to customers who are counter-examples of at least one of  the rules.

2In CAPRE, the eligible counter-examples are only the customers who purchase pZ at a level lower than ?Z .

B. Actionability of Counter-Examples  Let us now consider a cohort. With their partially unex-  ploited purchase potential, the counter-examples can theoret-  ically help the company to develop its turnover. However,  all the counter-examples cannot be equally receptive to our  recommendations. This is why our methodology focuses  on the most actionable counter-examples, i.e. the counter-  examples that are similar to examples according to the  customer characteristic variables (age, gender, income, etc.).

The more a counter-example is similar to the examples, the  more it is likely to behave like an example, i.e. to purchase  more of the consequent of the cohort.

1) Pre-actionability on Purchasing Variables (step 2 on  figure 1): To be close to the examples Ct+ of a cohort,  a counter-example e? should not display an extreme pur-  chasing behavior on the antecedents of the rules of the  cohort Ct. Given the purchases of example distribution on  the antecedents of the cohort, we define the median M and  (Q3 ? Q1) the interquartile range of the distribution. A counter-example e? ? Ct? is pre-actionable if and only if:  M ? (Q3 ?Q1) ? ?  p ? antecedents of the cohort Ct  u%(p, e?) ? M + (Q3 ?Q1)  (7)  For example, given the cohort Ct(Gravel = c), the purchases of examples on the antecedents of the cohort are  characterized by M = 40 % and Q3 ? Q1 = 20 %. To be pre-actionable, a counter-example e? ? Ct? must have spent between 20 % and 60 % of its turnover on cement,  sand and concrete mixer.

2) Actionability on Characteristic Variables (step 3 on  figure 1): In the multidimensional space of the customer  characteristics, we need a distance measure to assess simi-  larities between customers. As customer characteristics are  numerical and categorical variables, we consider the frame-  work of Factor Analysis of Mixed Data (FAMD) introduced  by Escofier in 1979 (see [20] and [21] for further details).

This framework provides the distance measure for mixed  data that we use in CAPRE. The customer characteristics  consist of numerical and categorical variables:  ? Let N be the set of centered and reduced numerical  variables.

? By applying a complete disjunctive coding on categor-  ical variables, we generate a set I of indicators3 (a  binary variable by modality).

The FAMD distance between customers c1 and c2 is defined  by:  d2(c1, c2) =  v ?  i=1  (Ni,c1 ?Ni,c2) 2+  w ?  j=1  (Ij,c1 ? Ij,c2) 2 (8)  3The values of these indicators are divided by the square root of frequency of each indicator.

For example, roofers and tilers purchase many common  products. They can be close by their purchases (see sec-  tion III-B1) but remote by their characteristic variables. For  the rule Cement Bag ? Tile, most examples are tilers.

However, roofers tend to regularly purchase 25kg bags  of cement to sink a fork or install a ridge roof. Even  if the counter-examples are tilers and roofers, you have  to recommend purchasing tiles only to tilers. Computing  actionability allows to avoid recommend purchasing tiles to  roofers.

To sum-up, a counter-example e? is actionable if it  is close enough to the examples. Given two thresholds  minDist and ?, e? is considered as ?-actionable for a  cohort Ct if and only if:  1) e? is pre-actionable (see section III-B1);  2) e? respects the following inequality:  ?  ?{e+ ? Ct+| d(e?, e+) 6 minDist} ?  ?  ?  ?Ct+ ?  ?  > ? (9)  with minDist a threshold defining a neighborhood around  the counter-example e?, and ? a threshold defining a mini-  mum ratio of neighbor examples to be actionable.

Given the distribution of the examples in the space  of customer characteristics, the distance from a counter-  example to the barycenter of the examples is not necessarily  representative. That is why we do not use the barycenter in  our measure.

C. Profitability of the Cohorts (step 4 on figure 1)  The profitability of a counter-example corresponds to the  value in Dollars of the Ct-Recommendation. For example,  for each actionable counter-example (see section III-B), we  compute the total turnover in Dollars that should have been  spent if the counter-example had behaved as an example  of the cohort. We denote by u(?, c) the sum ?  p?P u(p, c).

Given a threshold ? ? R+, a counter-example e? is defined as ?-profitable for the product pZ , i.e. for the recommenda-  tion Ct(pZ) if and only if:  Profit(Ct(pZ), e ?) = (u(?, e?) ? ?) ? u(pZ , e  ?) > ?  with the mean purchase ratio ? =  ?  c ? Ct+ u(pZ , c) ?  c ? Ct+ u(?, c) (10)  Therefore, the profitability of a cohort of rules corresponds  to the sum of the profitabilities of the ?-profitable counter-  examples of the cohort. From this value, we deduce fixed and  variable costs incurred by a business approach. Moreover, we  suggest using a scoring to refine the profitability expected for  each customer. The learning phase is guided by the examples  of the cohort and the application phase by the profitable  counter-examples.

D. Triggering the Most Actionable and Profitable Cohorts  (step 5 on figure 1)  1) Marketing Recommendation Campaigns: Several sce-  narios exist for decision makers to profitably action the  recommender system:  ? Sorting cohorts in order to identify the most profitable  Ct-Recommendations. Therefore, commercial actions  can be triggered to promote products.

? For each customer, sorting the cohorts in which the cus-  tomer is a ?-profitable counter-example. Salespersons  can trigger to one or more recommendations, creating  a personalized relationship with the target customer.

2) Return On Investment: The methodology presented  above allows us to propose an equation to calculate the  expected ROI before triggering the most actionable and prof-  itable cohorts, assuming that for each ?-profitable counter-  example e?, the profitability Profit(Ct(p), e?) is com- puted for the most profitable cohorts.

ROI = ?  c?C  p?P  Profit(Ct(p), c) ? ? with ? = ?+ ? ? ?  (11)  ? ?: operation fixed costs (salespersons? visits, commu-  nication, gifts, meals, advertising, etc.).

? ?: data mining costs: time for preprocessing, modeling  and reporting.

? ?: cost reduction due to time spent gain in the market-  ing department to establish recommendations.



IV. APPLICATION ON REAL DATA  A. Context  The VM Mate?riaux trading group offers more than  100,000 product references for professional building con-  tractors whose have different characteristic variables and  often atypical purchasing behaviors. Therefore, the use of  our methodology is appropriate to profitably recommend  products for target customers, creating a personalized rela-  tionship and assisting the salespersons? objective to increase  the customer value.

B. Purchasing Behavior Rule Mining  1) Data: To address the problem of over-specialization,  we use the product taxonomy of VM Mate?riaux. The ad-  vantage of this approach is to obtain relevant rules, in  which the most common products do not hide the less  common products by their frequency. For example, the rarest  products, such as photovoltaic panels, will be codified in  a more general level, while the most common products,  such as plaster boards, will be codified at a finer level. We  decided to collect data from our datawarehouse composed of  approximately 91 tera-bytes and 180 tables. 9,575 customers  having achieved a turnover threshold (defined by decision  makers) are selected and described through variables divided  into three groups:  ? 20 internal variables (in the datawarehouse): address,  loyalty, main salesperson, authorized outstanding, etc.

? 9 external variables (obtained from a Coface4 file):  number of employees, professional category, etc.

? 414 aggregates (computed from levels of the taxon-  omy): sum of turnover for each product family (cement,  insulation, etc.) within the year before a datetime.

This data preprocessing produces a model with 9,575 ob-  servations and 443 variables. In agreement with business  requirements, the purchases are made commensurable and  are discretized (see section III-A1) into three intervals a,  b and c of the same frequency 13 , to segment the small,  medium and large customer purchases, respectively.

2) Mining Cohorts of Rules: The extraction of association  rules is performed using the algorithm CHARM based on in-  depth research of closed itemsets [22] with support threshold  of 0.005 (i.e. about 50 customers) and a confidence threshold  of 75 %. A set of 7,788 rules is extracted (see table I) and  partitioned into 57 cohorts of rules.

Table I SOME RULES EXTRACTED BY THE CHARM ALGORITHM  Sup.(%) Conf.(%) Rules  0.006 78.13 Plaster = b & Metal = c ? Plaster Board = c 0.008 78.22 Tile = a & Parpen = c ? Cement = c 0.011 76.81 Adhesive Coating = c ? Plaster = c  To illustrate CAPRE, we focus on the cohort to recom-  mend the purchase of plaster Ct(Plaster = c). The cohort is composed of 12 rules, 150 distinct examples and 50 distinct  counter-examples.

C. Actionability of Counter-Examples  To select the actionable counter-examples of  Ct(Plaster = c), we compute the parameter minDist = 28.43 which is the average distance between all customers (see section III-B2) and we define with the  commercial direction (trading director, purchasing director  and sales force team) the threshold ? = 10 %. Therefore, a counter-example will be actionable if and only if:  ? It is pre-actionable, i.e. its purchasing behavior for  the antecedents of the rules of the cohort are in the  interquartile range defined in section III-B1.

? It has 10 % of the examples Ct+ of the cohort in its  neighborhood at a maximal distance of 28.43.

To apply these two steps, let us visualize on figure 3 the  distributions of examples Ct+ and counter-examples Ct?  on purchases from the antecedents of the cohort.

Antecedent purchases of Ct+ are characterized by a  median M = 37.32 % and an interquartile range Q3?Q1 = 28.05 %. Therefore, the counter-examples outside the inter- val [9.27 %; 65.37 %] are considered non pre-actionable.

This filtering allows to prune 4 counter-examples.

4http://www.coface.com     Figure 3. Distributions of Examples and Counter-Examples on Purchases from the Antecedents of a rule of the Cohort Ct(Plaster = c)  Secondly, to be actionable, the 46 counter-examples must  have 10 % of Ct+ in their neighborhood at a distance less  than or equal to 28.43 (see section III-B2). This second filter allows to prune 4 counter-examples. In the end, we select  42 actionable counter-example customers.

D. Profitability of the Cohorts  With the help of decision makers of VM Mate?riaux,  we considered that the solicitation of a customer by a  salesman were approximately $2 000. That is why, to run at  a healthy profit, decision makers decide to set the threshold  ? = $2, 000 from which a counter-example is profitable for a cohort. When applying (10) of our methodology, 38  actionable counter-examples are $2000-profitable for the  purchase of plaster.

50 46 42 38 pre-actionability actionability profitability  Figure 4. Summary of Counter-Example Filtering for Ct(Plaster = c)  For the 38 profitable counter-examples, the expected profit  for the cohort is estimated at about $420,000 of additional  turnover, i.e. over $11,000 per customer. To refine the  profitability expected for each customer, we decide to use  a scoring with the data mining software program KXEN.

To predict the continuous target of turnover per customer  for the consequent plaster = c, we choose to calculate a tendency score with a ridge regression. The learning  phase is guided by the 150 examples of the cohort and  the application phase by the 38 $2000-profitable counter-  examples for the purchase of plaster. The learning dataset  consists of a few customers. However, they represent a  very homogeneous population, i.e. with a strong purchasing  potential on the consequent of the cohort. Therefore, the  accuracy of the model rises. For the 38 profitable counter-  examples, the expected profit for the cohort is estimated at  about $264,373 of additional turnover, i.e. over $7,000 per  customer.

E. Triggering the Most Actionable and Profitable Cohorts  Our methodology has enabled the sales team to analyze  the behavior of their customers in order to understand why  some of them do not purchase certain products (price?,  competition?, etc.). Therefore, other marketing measures  will be implemented:  1) To promote products on targeted customers (free sam-  ples) by selecting the most profitable cohorts.

2) To target customers in a region or a store and recom-  mend some products based on cohorts in which these  customers are the most profitable.

Finally, based on profitable recommendations, supplier part-  nerships may be agreed on to highlight products.



V. EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION WITH MovieLens  In this section, we present the experimental results on  the movie-rating benchmark. MovieLens benchmark was  collected by GroupLens Research Project at the University  of Minnesota and contains 100,000 movie-rating data from  943 users on 1,682 movies. Each user has rated at least  20 movies from 1 (strongly unsatisfactory) to 5 (strongly  satisfactory). The dataset was converted into a binary user-  movie matrix C ? P that has 943 customers and 1,682 movies that were rated by at least one of the users. We  apply our methodology on the five usual learning datasets  named U[1-5].base and the five usual application datasets  named U[1-5].test. Training and validation datasets contain  80 % and 20 % of all ratings respectively. Customer char-  acteristic variables, i.e. N ? I , are the age, the gender and the occupation. We gathered the ratings into three classes  a = [1, 2], b = [3] and c = [4, 5].

A. Cross-Validation and Comparison  With a support threshold of 0.05 and a confidence thresh-  old of 50 %, we extract rules and generate the cohorts  summarized in table II. For robustness considerations, only  the cohorts with at least 20 rules are retained. To evaluate  the Top-N recommendations, we use the two classical met-  rics widely using in the recommender system community  namely, precision and recall. We privilege the precision  measure to minimize the number of false positive recom-  mendations. We present in table III the Top-10 and Bottom-  10 recommendations sorted by average precision Pr.

Table II CAPRE EXPERIMENT ON MovieLens BENCHMARK  U1.base U2.base U3.base U4.base U5.base  # of rules 26,658 12,487 12,456 9,516 13,028 # of cohorts 99 95 92 88 92  We notice the good results reached with CAPRE on  average precision Pr on the Top-10 recommendations (even  the Bottom-10 results are acceptable). The errors measured  by precision and recall are similar to those generally mea-  sured on MovieLens with RMSE (Root Mean Square Error).

Aggregating rules into cohorts allows to build a more  robust model than single rules, this reduces the errors of  recommendation.

Example and Discussion  Let us consider the rule Men in Black = c ? Indepen- dence Day = c, 102 customers who watched the action  movie Men in Black and voted positively (4 or 5) have  also watched the action movie Independence Day by voting  positively. However, 43 counter-examples have watched and  voted positively Men in Black but did not appreciate Inde-  pendence Day (vote 1 or 2 or 3). CAPRE allows to obtain 99  cohorts of rules. Let us focus on the cohort recommending  the movie Independence Day (see table IV). The cohort is  composed of four rules.

Table IV A COHORT OF FOUR RULES RECOMMENDING Independence Day  Sup.(%) Conf.(%) Rules  0.13 54.12 The Rock = c ? Ind. Day = c 0.12 52.28 Star Trek = c ? Ind. Day = c 0.11 54.12 Men in Black = c ? Ind. Day = c 0.10 56.54 Star Wars = c & The Rock ? Ind. Day = c  The pre-actionability, actionability and profitability steps  allow to prune the recommendations and target users:  ? Pre-actionability: from 188 to 140 pre-actionable  counter-examples. For instance, the user #236 is non  pre-actionable. Indeed he enjoyed the movie Star Trek  = c but voted negatively for movies The Rock,  Men in Black and Star Wars.

? Actionability: from 140 to 93 actionable counter-  examples. We note that examples are mostly men  between 20 and 45 years old of a particular occupa-  tion (student or engineer). Therefore, we prune many  counter-examples, such as 25-year old artist women.

? Profitability: we could easily assign a monetary value  on each movie, considering that the recommendation of  a movie like Independence Day yields $5 per streaming  viewing. Therefore, the expected profitability of the  cohort could be $465.

We can note that CAPRE methodology allows (i) to prune  sharply the number of recommendations and (ii) to filter  efficiently the number of potential customers. Moreover, we  observe customer rating behaviors throughout other cohorts:  ? Some cohorts have scattered examples because their  consequents are a very popular movie, such as  Star Wars. The behavior of the examples is difficult to  characterize through ratings or characteristic variables.

That is why, we little prune the counter-examples.

? However, for horror movies, examples show much  more typical behaviors. Counter-example customers  who view and appreciate at least one horror movie  of the cohort are generally actionable and profitable  because of a more restricted customer rating behavior.

That is why, we widely prune the counter-examples.

Finally, in [23], Onuma et al. showed that for  Horror Movie Fan, their system recommends  A Nightmare on Elm Street, The Shining and Jaws.

However, in our methodology, we can note that for the  cohort recommending Jaws, composed of 7 rules, we  prune the number of counter-examples from 144 to 75  actionable customers. By this way, we target more finely  the recommendation to the most receptive customers.



VI. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS  In this paper we propose CAPRE, a new methodology  for recommender systems based on the analysis of turnover  of customers for specific products. By measuring the action-  ability of rules based on the similarity between the examples  and counter-examples, we present an original measure of  the profitability of rules. Thus, the methodology allows not  only to make recommendations, but also to identify and sort  the most receptive customers for these recommendations,  and estimate the related profit. CAPRE is applied to over  10,000 individual customers and 100,000 products in the  framework of the customer relationship management of VM  Mate?riaux company, thus assisting the salespersons? objec-  tive to increase the customer value. The most actionable and  profitable recommendations are triggered and an expected  ROI is computed, with 7,788 rules and 57 cohorts, repre-  senting about $264,373 of additional turnover for plaster  recommendation. Thus, recommender systems applied to the  analysis of the turnover of customers would improve cus-  tomer relationships and generate qualitative and quantitative  profits for companies. The cross-validation performed on  the MovieLens benchmark shows that CAPRE makes good  recommendations with little errors (even on the Bottom-10  results).

We are currently using CAPRE in a real business applica-  tion. The goal is to use extensively CAPRE for any databases  of the type customers ? products. This article offers the prospect for further work. First, the measure of profitability  can be improved: the actionability of cohorts could be  modulated by the number of actionable counter-examples  and the net margin of recommended products. Secondly,  an application of recommendations can be integrated in the  corporate information system for decision makers. Finally,  an OLAP-based approach can be adapted to address decision  makers by trying to provide aggregated recommendations  (e.g. for brands or product families) to certain segments of  customers.
