Abstract-  Syed Zishan Ali  Computer Science & Engineering Raipur Institute of Technology  Raipur (C.G),1ndia  Today many data mmmg techniques have been implemented in order to retrieve useful patterns from the respective information. But Still there is an issue to generate the require patterns effectively. This paper shows a effective method for cross level frequent pattern mining. Data concerning Multilevel and cross level frequent patterns is attention-grabbing and helpful. The classic frequent pattern mining algorithms supported a homogenous minimum support, such as Apriori and FP-growth, either miss attention-grabbing patterns of low support or suffer from the bottleneck of itemset generation.

I. INTRODUCTION  Data is the peel of knowledge which can be summarized as  any facts, numbers or texts which might be processed by  machine. Information is made from numerous sources as  research project, transactions, forecast; satellite observation  and discovery etc. Information can be thought of as processed  information that has been given some means of relative  connections. This processed information will give solutions to  varied queries. Data Mining is a powerful new technology  with better potential to assist corporations, specialize in the  foremost necessary data within the information they need and  collect the behavior of their client and potential customers ..

Frequent pattern mining was initially presented by Agrawal  [I] for market basket analysis within the sort of association  rule mining. It Analyses client shopping Habits by finding  associations between the various things that customers place  in their "shopping baskets". One approach to construction  mining would be to directly  exploit the quality algorithms during this space - Apriori  [1] and FP-Growth [2] by iteratively applying them in an  exceedingly level by level manner to very idea level. During  this paper , we have a tendency to centered on  the study of frequent patterns supported the FP- tree [3] .The  algorithms Apriori and Fp-growth are generally implemented  in single level frequent pattern mining, although various  research has been done in these algorithms i.e. ADA  AFOPT[4] was invented by doing research on Fp-Growth  algorithm.

II. LITERATURE REVIEW  In this paper the author has projected its view towards the  Interaction between the user and the system in terms of  neural network and data mining. By implementing the  concept of data mining with the different techniques of  neural network, extremely good result was found. Data  mining and Neural Network both have various algorithms  that are used widely across the world. Data mining tools can  forecast the future trends and activities to support the  decision of people, where as Neural network techniques are  capable of making a machine to learn a new pattern [5] .

According to this paper " Research of Data Mining Based  on Neural Networks" the field of data mining is playing an  important role in the development of private organizations,  government sector and other areas. The author Xianjun Ni ,  has presented an example of customer relationship  intelligence such that the companies are taking advantage of  data mining algorithms. Some companies offer applications  like CRI(Customer Relationship Intelligence) which helps  companies to know and understand what their customer  want and what is the feedback towards the company.

Depending on the purpose of the data analysis, the user  might select different parameters for the preprocessing (e.g.

concentrate on names and dates) and for the clustering step  (e.g. use a more or less restrictive similarity measure)[6] .

The implementation of data mining algorithm in  pharmaceutical industry is a very good approach. In this  paper the author has focused on the benefits of using the  data mining techniques. According to the author it can be  used to find the patterns of drugs, analysis of new drug on  the basis of their results. Data mining fondly called patterns  analysis on large sets of data utilizes tools like association,  clustering, segmentation and classification for helping  better implementation of the data help the pharma firms  compete on lower costs while increasing the quality of drug  discovery and delivery methods[7] .

The author MirelaPater, DanielaE.Popescu presented in his  paper "Multi-Level Database Mining Using AFOPT Data  Structure and Adaptive Support Constrains" that individual  items in each level are divided two parts: normal items and  exceptional items [4] . At every stage two separate threshold  values are used i.e. both for the normal items and  exceptional items. The Author MirelaPater,  DanielaE.Popescu have compared different algorithm and  presented an analysis based on their performance.

III. METHODOLOGY USED  .4.1 CHALLENGES AND APPROACHES According to the paper [8] and as mentioned in section 3.5, there is a given tree structure data set in which entries are  placed in a hierarchical form.

This paper has three primary analysis contributions:  1. Combining multi-level hierarchy information encoded  technique and frequent pattern mining methodology.

2. Conduction of experiments on real world data.

3. Assembling some representative cases to know totally  different learning necessities.

Previous study on multilevel data is basically based on  fmding association rule but here the main challenge is to find  more interesting patterns and items sets in cross level .we  consider that the data set is divided into three levels: level  I ,level 2 and level 3.

NUMERICAL METHOD FOR FREQUENT PATTERN MINING.

Frequent pattern mining is one of the active researches in  data processing. It plays a vital role altogether data mining  tasks like cluster, classification, prediction, and association  analysis. Extracting all frequent patterns is the most time  consuming method because of a huge variety of patterns  generated. A reasonable way is to extract repeated frequent  patterns that form a set of patterns to get all frequent patterns.

This methodology is predicated on prime characteristics to  get all frequent patterns. We have taken reference from this  paper [9] , the basic methodology of my paper is taken from  this research paper.

Data Transformation is the most important and initial step  which requires the given data set and steps necessary for  transforming data. Our technique uses a prime-based  knowledge transformation technique to scale back the  dimensions of transaction info. It transforms every group  action into a positive number known as Transaction value  (TV)[lO] .

Given transaction T = (tid, X) where tid is the transaction-id  and X = {ij ... ik} is the transaction-items or pattern X. While  the PC_Tree algorithm reads transaction T, the transformer  procedure considers a prime number Pr for each item irin  pattern X, and then TV Mis computed by following formula  where T= (tid, X), X = {ij ... ik} and iris presented by Pr-  k TVtid = II tPr (I)  Therefore, all transactions is described in a compacted  layout using this transformation  technique. A positive integer N can be expressed by unique  product N = Pl ml P2  m2 . . . .  Pr and mj is a positive integer,  called the multiplicity of Pj  To facilitate the understanding of the transformation method  utilized in our methodology, let's  examine it through an example. Consider item set Z =  {P,Q,R,S,T,U}.

Table I Transaction database and transaction valnes  TID Items Transformed TV 1 P,Q,R,S,T 2,3,5,7, 1 1  23 1 0 2 P,Q,R,S,U 2,3,5,7, 13  2730 3 P,Q,T 2,3, 1 1 66 4 P,R,S,U 2,5,7, 1 1  770 5 R,S,U 5,7, 13 455 6 P,R,S,U 2,5,7, 13  910 7 P,R,U 2,5,7 70  The transaction database, DB, be the first two columns of  Table 1 with seven transactions. As shown in the fourth  column of Table I, DB can be presented by TVs which very smaller than original transactions.

After giving the transaction value to each transaction data we  have calculated value of TV, now each item in the TABLE I  has its own frequency or Item frequency which is mentioned  in below TABLE II.

Table II Frequency of individual items  Item Prime Number Item Frequency P 2 6 Q 3 3 R 5 7 S 7 7 T II 3 U 13  4  For Example:  Consider we have a transaction given:  15 8 11 Then its transaction id(TID) can be calculated by allotting prime number to each separate transaction.

August 01-02, 2014, Dr. Virendra Swarup Group of Institutions, Unnao, India  With the increase of e-Learning, a lot of helpful learning  materials are made available to public access. Therefore, an  appropriate learning suggestion mechanism is a crucial tool  to enable learners to figure a lot with efficiency. A smoother  learning method will increase the educational result,  avoiding unnecessarily trouble some ideas and disorientation  throughout learning. However, several suggestion demands  from totally different abstraction levels, and traditional  single level frequent pattern mining is not perfect and  complete for further analysis. This paper proposes a strategy  for mining frequent patterns of learners' behavior that  suggest a hierarchical strategy to anticipate cross-level  learning suggestions. With this method, a learner will get  multiple levels of abstract suggestions rather than simply  single level frequent pattern mining results.

This paper has applied a frequent pattern tree (FP-tree)  structure along with the concept of prime base method, that  is beneficial for storing compressed, crucial information  concerning frequent patterns, and use FP-growth to mine the  whole set of frequent patterns. The FP-growth technique will  get scalable results for mining each long and short frequent  patterns than the Apriori rule. This study provides a helpful  application applying information mining methodology  within the e-Learning field. Our study shows that cross-level  frequent pattern mining will provide learners varied learning  suggestions as well as provides the ways of multiple-level  hierarchy information encoded technique and frequent  pattern mining, providing a brand new utilization in data  processing field.

Let's recall the hierarchical structure we have mentioned in  section 3.5 .

ELECTRICAL  ENGINEERING &  (1**) (2**) (3**) Electrical Engineeri Computer Engineeri ng Science Science  Figure I Sample data set  In this paper all the nodes of this hierarchical structure is  considered as a structure of child node , parent node and  super parent node as mentioned below:  Super  parent  ELECTRICAL  COMPUTER SCIENCE  ?

For Example:  Parent(l) = pr(A) * pr(B)  Parent(2) = pr(C) * pr(D)  Parent(3) = pr(E) * pr(F)  To find comparatively occurring patterns, a user could  specify two thresholds: minimum support, minsup[l] , and  minimmn confidence, minconf[I] .Notice that for locating  cross-level frequent patterns, totally different minimmn  support and/or minimum confidence are often fixed at totally  different levels. The qualification of the cross-level frequent  item sets take as follows. Let the minimum support at level I , 2 and 3 be 3, 3 and (minsup[3] =4). Hence, the educational  item '322' ought to be removed as mentioned in section 3.5, as its prevalence is not up to its strength.

4.3 STEPS OF METHODOLOGY   I-    August 01-02, 2014, Dr. Virendra Swarup Group of Institutions, Unnao, India  Step 1: [nitially it is necessary to transfonn the data into appropriate  fonn. Here Data transformation takes place as follows.

If  the 'Tid' is divisible by the number of 'Par' then we consider it is a part of the node and place some value for  identification , here we have use ' [ , for this step.

rem = mod(tid(i) ,par(j? ;  set(i,j) = 1;  then the matrix will be as follows:  Table III Set Matrix 0 0 0 0 0 0 I 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 I 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 I 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  Similarly, the next matrix for the super parent will be created  by as :  rem mod (tid (i) ,spar(j? ;  sset(i,j) = 1;  Table IV Parent matrix  I 35 Electromagnetism 0 0 0  0 0 0 (12*)  0 0 0  0 0 0  0 0 0  0 0 0  Faraday's Law --'.. n ?

Step 5:  mod(tid(i),pr(j)) == 0 bmat(i,j) = 1;  Table V Base Matrix o 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0  1 1  1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0  1 1  1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0  o 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0  o 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0  1 0  It includes giving the value of threshold for different level.

For example here we have mentioned threshold value as  3,3,4.

minsup(l) minsup(2) minsup(3)  3; 3; 4 ;  after generating the value of minimum support threshold we  will find those column which have '1'.

ind = find(bmat(:,i) == 1); freb(i) = 1ength(ind);  once the column are generated then it will be compared with  the given threshold value as follows.

ms3 = find(freb >= minsup(3)); ms2 = find(fres >= minsup(2));  ms1 = find(fress >= minsup(l)); len = 1ength(ms1) + 1ength(ms2) +  1ength(ms3) ;  after filtering the set, sset and bmat the next step is to create a  matrix based on these threshold values.i.e a ux = bma t ( : , ms 3) ; bux = set (: ,ms2);  cux = sset (: ,ms1);  1. Assigning unique prime number to each  basic transaction(3rd level)  2. Product the child prime number to allocate  id to parent node.

3. Product the parent node to identity super  parent node.

4. Calculating Tid for each of the transaction  for transaction database.

5. If for each transaction id calculate each  parent id  If mod(par(i), Tid)== 1>  Then adding it to enriched database  End if  Endif  6. For each transaction  F or each super parent  If  mode spar(i), Tid)==O  Then adding  it to enriched database  End if  7. Applying threshold to each level and     August 01-02, 2014, Dr. Virendra Swarup Group of Institutions, Unnao, India  Finally a fmal matrix is created" fnnat" based on aux,bux  and cux. After applying the procedure we get the result as  follows:  11,31 12,313 4 14,5111,2,3,61 14,5,71  [111,112,212,231,321] 11*32*]

IV. CONCLUSION  The aim of this paper is to propose an effective way for  cross-level frequent pattern mining. Multi-level and cross  level frequent pattern mining is a very interesting and  useful tool. It can be implemented to facilitate business  sales and transaction analyses. In this paper two different  approaches are studied and combined, such that more better  way to mine frequent patterns are available. By implementing  the concept of one paper which is based on prime numbers  and using its methodology on the cross level patterns, better  results are shown. The second paper contains tree structured  of the transactions, in this paper there is a advantage over the  tree structure that the transaction of each level is represented  in the form of matrix. So the transactions can be represented  in the form of numbers and matrix.
