Research of Fire Predicting Model Based Association Rule Data Mining

Abstract: Some countries in the world have different the degree of fires every year, it caused the serious damage to the ecological environment, not only losing huge resources, but wasting a lot of manpower and material resources. A new approach to forecast fire information is presented in this paper, which will provide efficient theoretical support and technical guidance.

Keywords: Fire, Forecasting, Association rule, Data mining?  1 Introduction   Fires are an integral part of almost all natural area ecosystems, and over the course of many centuries have exerted an exceptionally important influence on the condition and structure of environment in many regions of the planet. Fires have been the cause of numerous and irreversible damages with deep ecological and socio-economic impacts. Strong combustion not only brings economic loss to human being, but also changes ecological structure, land biology, climate and soil performance. According to statistics, there are more than hundred thousand fires and catastrophic fires cover up to multimillion ha area all over the world every year.

Especially, with global warming, fires have maintained upward since 1980s.[1] Only to forest fires, a catastrophic forest fire covering up to 1.5?106 ha occurred in Indonesia in June 1997 and burned for half a year. The smoke spread to Singapore, the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand and other countries.[2] The forest fire caused famine and epidemic, people?s safety and health were threatened and the environment was polluted. China is a country which has suffered many forest fires. There were 6.26?105 forest fires from 1950 to 1990, and the mean burnt area each year was 8.2?105 ha, and so on. The amount of all kinds of fires in the world is increasing rapidly. Fires destroy not only social resources, but also environments. Fires have caused huge economic losses and damages to the environment. Therefore, fire occurrence prediction, prevention and management measures have become increasingly important, it is an   ?

urgent problem to be solved how about fire occurrence and spread to forecast, which will provide decision support for fire prevention and fire fighting. It is envisioned that the forecasting of fire dynamics in enclosures will lead to a paradigm shift in the response to fire emergencies, providing the fire service with essential information about the development of the fire with some lead time (i.e. seconds or minutes ahead of the event).[3]  For fire forecast, this issue has also been considered in many references. The most famous system is used by the Canadian forest services and has been under development since 1968.[4] It is the Canadian Forest Fires Danger Rating System (CFFSDRS).[5] The model NFDRS (National Fire Danger Rating System) is a similar approach to the CFFSDRS.[6] This system has the ability to predict the risk of fire occurrence for the next 24 hour. It outputs a series of indices that takes into account fuel moisture, weather data, and the slope of the forward rate of spread. A main difference between NFDRS and CFFSDRS is that NFDRS can also estimate the available energy per area unit and hence generate the probability that a fire will start if a heat source is placed near the fuel. It also tries to incorporate human causes or natural causes by generating an index associated with the connection of a fire to human or natural cause (lightening). Lisbon's ICARO's surveillance system has started in 1999 as a result of the cooperation between the Portuguese Health Observatory (ONSA) and the Portuguese Weather Service (IM).[7] ICARO's surveillance system is operational from May, 15 to September 30 and has proven to be extremely useful in mitigating the impacts on population health of the severe heat waves of August 2003 and August 2005.[8] The system is composed by three main components; (i) 3-day forecasts of maximum temperature; (ii) forecasts of associated excess mortal mortality; and (iii) computation of ICARO index which is an indicator of the severity of the situation. ICARO index is available to decision makers every morning and an accurate 3-hour forecast of maximum temperature at the local and regional levels is of invaluable assistance to those that are responsible for issuing warnings and alerts.

On the basis of previous studies, we presents a new approach based association rule data mining to forecast fires for fire prevention and fighting with           theoretical basis and guiding significance. Firstly, the sample data set about assessment indexes of describing fire situation; Secondly, we find out useful information about possible future fire with association rule data mining.

2 Forecasting fires with association rule data mining  In this section, we use association rule data mining technology to analysis the relationship rules between assessment indexes based history data. Then useful information to forecasting future fires will be found, such as fires grade, fires place, and so on.

2.1 Definitions of association rule data mining with fire assessment indexes  Association rule was originally proposed by Agrawal and Srikant in 1993. Then in the literatures [9, 10, 11], they generalized association rule again. The aim of association rule is to find out the contact with different commodity (set) in the trade data base, that is, to look for the interesting contact in the appointed data collection.

Through the description of the potential relation rules between data sets in the data base, we can discover the dependence relations between many domains which are satisfied with the given threshold value of support and confidence. For discussing problems conveniently, we give several definitions of association rule with fire situation.

Definition 1. Let D, D={t1,t2,?,tk,?tn} be association rule mining data collection, tk ={i1,i2,?,ii,?ip }(k=1,2,?,n), tk stands up an affair and the element in tk is called by an Item which is the description of the fire situation.

Definition 2. We assume that I={i1,i2,?,im} is composed of all items in D. Any subset X of I is called itemset. X is called X-itemset if there is ?X?=k.

Association rule is the implication formula such as X?Y, where X?I, Y?I, also X?Y=?. X is the forward item and Y is the back item; Association rule can reflect the rule when the item of X appears, the item of Y must be. In fire problems, the interesting association rule can provide the reliable data for future fires prevention and fighting.

Definition 3. The number of affairs including item X in D is modeled as the support number of item X, namely ?x. The support rate of item X is figured as support(X),  %100)(sup ??? j  x  D Xport        (1)  where ?D?denotes the affair number of D. If support(X) is not smaller than the appointed smallest support, called min-support, we can reckon X as a big item, conversely a small item. The support rate of X?Y is the support rate of association rule X?Y, namely support(X?Y) = support(X?Y). And we denote the confidence of association rule X?Y by confidence(X?Y):  %100 )(sup  )(sup)( ???? Xport  YXportYXconfidence   (2)  The smallest confidence which is designated by the user could be figured as min-confidence.

2.2 Process of mining association rules  The process of mining association rules is categorized into the followings: (1) finding out all of big items; (2) coming into being association rules through big items.

(1) Finding out all of big items: According to definitions, the frequency that these big items appear is at least as same as the appointed smallest support number.

Firstly, we establish the sample data set D of fire data over years in Tab.1.

Tab.1 Fires sample data set D  TID    t1    t2  ?  tk  ? tn P1        V11   V12 ?  V1k ? V1n P2        V21   V22 ?  V2k ? V2n ?     ?    ?      ?     ? Pi      Vi1   Vi2 ?  Vik  ? Vin ?     ?     ?       ?    ? Pm     Vm1   Vm2 ? Vmk ?  Vnn  Where Pi is the place of fire and tk (k?n) is the item of D. In this paper, we assume that tk is an assessment index. Because there are plenty of assessment indexes, we choose the fire survey, large fires, major fires, fire reasons, police action, battle results as t1, t2, t3, t4. The fire survey (t1) includes three items as following, fire number (i1), death number (i2), injured number (i3), property loss (i4); we choose fire number(i5, i6) as only item for large fires and major fires; there are human factors (i7), electrical (i8), production operations (i9), with the fire carelessly (i10), smoking (i11), playing with fires (i12), spontaneous combustion (i13), lightning strike (i14), static electricity (i15), vague reasons (i16), others (i17) in t2; there are inputs to the human resources (i18) and inputs to vehicles (i19) in t3; there are the number of saving (i20), the number of evacuation (i21) and saving property (i22) in t4. In this paper, we use Apriori algorithm to mine the Boolean association rules so that the value of quantitative attribute should be transformed to Boolean values. We will disperse the value of quantitative attribute. ?i1~i22? are quantitative attribute, for the consistency of record amounts in every group, we disperse the twenty-two quantitative attributes based on same length or same distance method.

For Pi, if Vi1=163, Vi2=3, Vi3=0, Vi4=249370, Vi5=1, Vi6=0, Vi7=7, Vi8=62, Vi9=7, Vi10=31, Vi11=11, Vi12=6, Vi13=9, Vi14=0, Vi15=0, Vi16=0, Vi17=30, Vi18=3221,  Vi19=769, Vi20=10, Vi21=7, Vi22=621, then Tab.1 could be transformed to Tab.2 after above disposal.

Tab.2 Affair data transformed from Tab.1 TID List of Transaction Item Pi a5, b1, c1, d4, e1, f1, g1, h4, i1,  j3, k1, l1, m1, o1, p1, q1, r2, s4, t2, u1, v1, w1  We can obtain the affair data base through the homologous process.

(2) Coming into being association rules through big items: Here we employ conventional Apriori algorithm, and we assume that min-support is 0.7 and the lowest threshold of min-confidence is destined for 0.5. We make the assumption any frequency item l and its nonempty subset s, if there is the following formula:  confidence sport lport min )(sup )(sup ?     (3)  then we can output the rule s?(l-s). If this results in interesting rules such as A: j3?a3 s4 t4 [57%, 84%], ? ? we can explain it: there are 40-60 fires with the fire carelessly, the probability is above 57%, then we dispatch that the number of personnel and vehicles are in [3000, 4000) and [600, 800) respectively. It is confidence is above 84%. We can use the association rule to retrieval the sample data set D to find out the place data which conforms to the range of j3, a3, s4, t4. We need to take measures to strength the management of making use of fire by human being.
