I. PREFACES The emergence of data mining technology provides us  with useful information quickly and accurately from numerous data. In recent years, data mining technology and the related decision supporting system develop very quickly, which have already directly or indirectly astonishingly profited numerous professions, such as industry, business and public service sector...etc. Because the mining of association rule can find out valuable connection or association implicated among the data collection from the various information resources, which is the urgent request of each business decision maker, so, the research of it becomes hot in data mining and applied extensively in the fields such as transaction analysis and marketing. The more effective and more influential Algorithms such as Apriori, DHP and PARTITION are widely used. A lot of researchers carried on to optimize the algorithms mentioned above to improve the efficiency, so as to widen the application of association rule.



II. .THE DATA MINING TECHNOLOGY BASED ON ASSOCIATION RULE  The association rule is a rule to depict the potential relations lied in the data item of database, which can deduce the appearance of some items in one transaction according to the similar situation. The task that discovers association rule  is to discover those strong rules approaching to the settled values in confidence and support from the database.

A. classically and repeatedly gather algorithms Agrawal and his colleagues at the beginning of 1993  firstly put forward to mine the association rule of the items in the database of customers? transactions, of which the core algorithm is recursive based on the theory of frequency set. It is a method based on two-step, which divided the design of Algorithms of Association Rule Mining Data into two sub- problems:  ? Find out all of the items of which the support is bigger than the minimum support, that is, discover to frequency set, which is the most important in the process of mining the association rules and costs the most time and space spending. Thus, the various improvement algorithms mainly make efforts on the promotion of efficiency of frequency set.

? According to acquisition got of the multifarious item, gather and produce the rule of expectation, namely strong association rule [1].

Because of the simple operation of step-2 medium, the whole function of the mining association rule is in accordance with the function of the operation processing of step-1. The algorithm makes use of the following two basic properties: Property1 Any subset of frequent collection must be frequent collection.

Property2 Any superset collection of non-frequent collection must be non-frequent collection.

The basic thought of the algorithm: Find out all the frequent collections at first, and then get strong association rule according to the frequent collection.

B. Apriori Algorithm Apriori algorithm was put forward by Agrawal in 1994,  of which the first step is to count all the frequency of the items containing one element generally to find out the maximum one-dimensional item. In the k step, there are two stages, at first, candidate items ck is generated from maximum item sets Lk-1,which is generated from the step of k-1 by using function sc_ candidate(candidate for election).Then search the database and count the candidate   DOI 10.1109/IHMSC.2011.103    DOI 10.1109/IHMSC.2011.103     items set support. For more quickly computing candidate item sets support, use function count support to compute support in the text[4,5,6].

The Apriori Algorithm is described as follows (1) C1={candidate1-itemsets}; (2) L1={c C1|c.count>=minsupport}; (3) For(k=2, ? Lk-1 ? , k++)//until there is no bigger  item sets.

(4)Ck=sc_candidate(Lk-1);//create candidate items  containing k element (5)The for all transactions t D// perform operation (6)Ct=count_support;(Ck, t)// the candidate items  contained in the transaction of k (7)The for all candidates c Ct (8)c.count=c.count+1; (9) Next (10)Lk (11) Next (12)Resultset=resultset Lk Among them, the D means a database; The minsupport  means minimum support settlled; The result set means that all biggest item sets.

Upwards, Algorithms of one-dimensional Association Rule according to Apriori is displayed, which can be used to attain the Association Rule of meeting minimum support and confidence. But, making use of the Apriori method may produce a great deal of candidates sets, and then arouse huge time and space expense due to pattern match .



III. IMPROVED MULTI-DIMENSION ALGORITHMS ASSOCIATION OF ASSOCIATION RULE MINING PRODUCES NO  CANDIDATES.

the Apriori method has some inherent defects, for  overcoming them, this text puts forward Algorithm of multidimensional of producing no candidates.The Algorithm which adopte the thought based on recursive function calls, and by adding suffix judgment to the tail of frequent predicate constantly, can be found out all frequent k- dimensional predicate sets. This kind of Algorithm is to change the problem of long frequent mode into short ones using recursive method linking the suffixes as the second procedure, lower the expense of searching and increase the mining speed at the same time that there will be no frequent phrases candidate.

Similar to algorithms of one-dimensional Association Rule, algorithms of multi-dimensional Association Rule are also mainly divided into two steps.

(1)Find out all frequent predicate sets. The pseudo code of multi-dimension association Rule Mining of which based on improved algorithms of apriori is below.

Input: Trade database D(the attribute dimension of D is N), the minimum threshold support is min sup;  Output: the frequent predicate sets of D are Li; Operation: //By scanning relation database D, count each predication  (one dimension) of every attribute dimension  //If one predication item satisfy the min sup, it will be kept in frequent 1- call predicate sets L1 as frequent predicate sets of one dimension  L1= find_frequent_1_ itemset (D); // find out all frequent 1-called a predication item, and keep them in the L1  //After finding out L1, take L1 as foundation, change the method of solving Lk into the ones of solving Lk- 1(2<=k<=N) recursively  for( k=2; L k-1 ??, K<=N;k++) { Lk =apriori gen(L k?1, min sup);// produce frequent  predicate sets k according to frequent predicate sets (k-1) } //The apriori gen is used for producing k-call predication  candidate item ck, and making comparisons of the count of ck and min sup  // If ck is bigger than min sup, take it as an frequent k- predication item or abandon it, avoid of producing huge candidate predicate sets  Apriori gen(Lk-1 ,min sup) { While (++k<=N) //while the dimensions of frequent  predication are fewer than the attribute dimensions of trade database D  } For each (l1 L1 and l1 ? Lk-1) // l1 is a predication  item which is not included in any sub item of Lk-1 For each lk-1 Lk-1// perform operation below to every  predication item of Lk-1 ck=lk-1 Lk-1; //of Candidate for k-predication item's ck  as the conjunction of the lk-1 and the li For each t D// Scan the database to count if (t=lk-1 l1 );//If the modes of trade t and candidate  predicate item are matched ck.count++;// add 1 to the count of candidate predicate  item if(ck.count>min_ sup {  //if the count of c1 satisfy the minimum support  } Lk .add(ck ); //Add ck to the Lk L k+1=apriori gen(Lk ,min sup); (Lk, min  sup);//recursion calling of apriori gen, Lk+1 is built by Lk } } } (2) The strong association rule is generated by frequent  predicate items. multidimensional association rule are obtained easily by all frequent predicate sets satisfied minimum support though the fist step,and by using the judgment of minimum confidence.

The above multi-dimension Algorithm of Association Rule Mining is modified on the base of original Algorithm of apriori. The core of the Algorithm is recursion, in which long frequent patterns will be changed into short recursive ones at all levels, frequent predicate will be abandoned instead of being putted away in frequent predicate candidate ,thus extra     expense will be avoided and efficiency will be raised effectively.



IV. THE APPLICATION OF COLLEGE EMPLOYING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM BASED ON IMPROVED ALGORITHMS  OF APRIORI  College employing management system could be improved and module of data mining could be added with this algorithm. By making use of mining the data of undergraduate employment instruction center of Jiamusi university between 2000 and 2005, we formed associate rules as follows:  (1)If professional result is "excellent" and foreign language level is "cet-4", and then you will work in state enterprises of the first class;  (2)If foreign language level is "cet-6 or above" and practice ability is? good" or? excellent" Then you will work in foreign company of the first class;  (3)If computer level is "level 2 or above" and professional result is "good", Then you will work in private company of the first class;  (4)If foreign language level is "cet-4" and practice ability is"good" Then you will work in state enterprises of the first class;  By the above rules we can see that, for three different types of company: State enterprise, foreign company and private company, in order to raise employment, for state enterprise, lay particular emphasis on strengthening the training of the professional quality; for foreign company , lay particular emphasis on the training of foreign language and practice ability, for the characteristics of foreign company, high language level is of great importance, so is the practice ability; for private company, make greater efforts to train professional qualities.

The information obtained when the mining Data handle the huge amount of data is abundant. These rules provide realistic basis to the management and decision of the school, and they have very strong realistic meaning.

CONCLUSIONS This page presents Multi-dimension employment data  mining rely on improved algorithm of association rule. By write data mining platform to carry on algorithm realization, The results indicated that algorithm promotes the efficiency effectively, also show the rules using data mining, when decision maker and governor establish and implement every regulation, taking these data mining rules in policy system for reference in determining system will promote the efficiency of management. As a result of data mining, the conclusion which obtained by making use of improved algorithm have higher actual application value.
