I. INTRODUCTION  Atanassov [1] extended Zadeh?s fuzzy set to intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) by introducing an additional attribute param- eter called non-membership degree. IFS has been shown to be superior to Zadeh?s fuzzy set in e.g. semantic expression and inference ability [2]. There have been many studies on theory and application of IFS, such as multi-criteria fuzzy decision-making [3], [4], clustering [5], [6], medical diagnosis [7], [8] and pattern recognition [9], [10].

Fuzzy neural networks combine fuzzy concepts and fuzzy inference rules with the architecture and learning of neural networks, and have been successfully applied in control, pattern recognition and expert system [11]?[13]. Fuzzy Associative Memory (FAM) network, as a member of fuzzy neural networks, has been widely applied in image process- ing and optimization [14], [15]. Since IFS has proved to be more powerful to deal with vagueness and uncertainty than Zadeh?s fuzzy set, the combination of IFS and artifi- cial neural network has drawn more and more attentions [16]. In this paper, similar to FAM network [17]?[19], an intuitionistic fuzzy associative memory (IFAM) network is proposed by combining IFS with associative memory neural network. Based on Go?del fuzzy implication operator and its dual fuzzy co-implication operator, a learning rule  ?

for multiple intuitionistic fuzzy pattern pairs in IFAM is presented. Furthermore, The storage capacity of IFAM is investigated. We will prove that if there exists a matrix that can achieve perfect association of multiple intuitionistic fuzzy pattern pairs, our proposed rule can efficiently encode these pairs in a single IFAM and achieve perfect association of these pairs.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Some basic concepts of IFS are collected in Section 2. IFAM is described and a learning rule is proposed in Section 3. Section 4 presents our main result and its proof. Finally, an illustrative example is given in Section 5.



II. PRELIMINARIES  Atanassov generalizes Zadeh?s fuzzy set to IFS: Definition 1 [1] Let X be a given set. An intuitionistic  fuzzy set A is a collection having the form  A = {< x, ?A(x), ?A(x) > |x ? X}, where the functions ?A(x) : X ? [0, 1] and ?A(x) : X ? [0, 1] define the membership degree and the non-membership degree respectively of the element x ? X to the set A, and for every x ? X, 0 ? ?A(x) + ?A(x) ? 1.

Specifically, when the given set X is finite, say, X = {x1, x2, . . . , xm}, IFS A can be expressed as a so-called intuitionistic fuzzy vector:  A = (< ?A(x1), ?A(x1) >,< ?A(x2), ?A(x2) >, . . . , < ?A(xm), ?A(xm) >).

Definition 2 [20] Let X and Y be two given sets. An intuitionistic fuzzy relation R from X to Y is an IFS of X ? Y characterized by the membership function ?R(x, y) and the non-membership function ?R(x, y), denoted by  R = {< (x, y), ?R(x, y), ?R(x, y) > |x ? X, y ? Y}, where the functions ?R(x, y) : X?Y ? [0, 1] and ?R(x, y) : X ? Y ? [0, 1] satisfy 0 ? ?R(x, y) + ?R(x, y) ? 1, for every (x, y) ? X ? Y.

In particular, when the given sets X and Y are finite, say, X = {x1, x2, . . . , xm} and Y = {y1, y2, . . . , yn}, the    intuitionistic fuzzy relation R from X to Y can be denoted by an intuitionistic fuzzy matrix R = (rij)m?n, where rij =< ?R(xi, yj), ?R(xi, yj) >.

Similar to the definitions in [20], the following two definitions are given:  Definition 3 Let R = (< rij , rij >)m?n and S = (< sij , sij >)n?l be two matrices, where rij , rij , sij , sij ? [0, 1]. The max-min composite operation ??? of R and S is defined by  R ? S = (< n?  k=1  (rik ? skj), n?  k=1  (rik ? skj) >)m?l.

Definition 4 Let R = (< rij , rij >)m?n and S = (< sij , sij >)m?n be two matrices, where rij , rij , sij , sij ? [0, 1]. Write R ? S, if rij ? sij and rij ? sij hold for i = 1, 2, . . . ,m and j = 1, 2, . . . , n.



III. IFAM AND ITS LEARNING RULE  Intuitionistic fuzzy associative memory (IFAM) network is a combination of IFS and associative memory network.

The network consists of n input units and m output units. Let {Ak, Bk}Kk=1 be a given set of intuitionistic fuzzy pattern pairs with Ak = (< ak1 , a  k 1 >,< a  k 2 , a  k 2 >, ? ? ? , < akn, akn >)  and Bk = (< bk1 , b k  1 >,< b k 2 , b  k  2 >, ? ? ? , < bkm, b k  m >), where aki , b  k i and a  k i , b  k  i represent the membership degrees and the non-membership degrees, respectively. The goal of the network learning is to find a weight matrix U = (< uij , uij >)n?m such that  Ak ? U = Bk, k = 1, 2, ? ? ? ,K (1) where ? ? ? stands for the max-min composite operation.

In order to solve (1), based on Go?del fuzzy implication operator and its dual fuzzy co-implication operator, we propose the following learning rule for the given multiple intuitionistic fuzzy pattern pairs in IFAM:  wij = K?  k=1  ( aki ? bkj  ) , (2)  wij = K?  k=1  ( aki ??? b  k  j  ) , (3)  where the symbols ? ? ? and ? ??? ? stand for the Go?del fuzzy implication operator and its dual fuzzy coimplication operator respectively:  aki ? bkj = {  1 aki ? bkj , bkj a  k i > b  k j ;  (4)  aki ??? b k  j =  { 0 aki ? b  k  j ,  b k  j a k i < b  k  j .

IV. MAIN RESULT AND ITS PROOF  Definition 5 We say that system (1) is solvable if there exists a matrix U = (< uij , uij >)n?m satisfying (1) with all uij , uij ? [0, 1].

Theorem 1 Assume system (1) is solvable. Then system (1) can be solved by the matrix W generated by the learning rule (2)?(5).

Before we prove the theorem, we remark that Theorem 1 shows that the proposed learning rule (2)?(5) can effi- ciently encode multiple intuitionistic fuzzy pattern pairs in a single IFAM and achieve perfect association of these pairs.

Furthermore, Theorem 1 constructively gives a criterion to judge whether system (1) is solvable or not.

Proof of Theorem 1. Let the sets {1, 2, ? ? ? , n}, {1, 2, ? ? ? ,m} and {1, 2, ? ? ? ,K} be denoted by N , M and K , respectively, and let W = (< wij , wij >)n?m be generated by (2)?(5). We proceed to show the desired result by proving successively the inequalities Ak?W ? Bk, ?k ? K and Ak ? W ? Bk, ?k ? K .

Proof of Ak ?W ? Bk, ?k ? K . Let U = (< uij , uij > )n?m be a solution of system (1). Then for all j ? M and k ? K , there holds  bkj = n?  i=1  ( aki ? uij  ) , b  k  j = n?  i=1  ( aki ? uij  ) .

Hence, for all k ? K , i ? K and j ? M we have  bkj ? ( aki ? uij  ) , b  k  j ? ( aki ? uij  ) .

If aki > b k j , then we have 0 ? uij ? bkj . Otherwise, we have  0 ? uij ? 1. This together with (2) and (4) leads to  uij ?  ? ??1 ?  ? ?? ?  {k?K |ak i >bk  j } bkj  ? ?? ? ?? = wij . (6)  Similarly, If aki < b k  j , then we have b k  j ? uij ? 1.

Otherwise, we have 0 ? uij ? 1. This together with (3) and (5) leads to  uij ?  ? ??0 ?  ? ?? ?  {k?K |aki <b k  j } b k  j  ? ?? ? ?? = wij . (7)  Combining (6), (7) and Definition 4, we get U ? W. It follows from the property max-min composite operation that for all k ? K ,  Bk = Ak ? U ? Ak ? W. (8)  Proof of Ak?W ? Bk, ?k ? K . For any k ? K , i ? K and j ? M , if bkj < aki , then it follows from the definition    of Go?del fuzzy implication operator that  aki ? wij = aki ? (  K? k=1  ( aki ? bkj  ))  ? aki ? ( aki ? bkj  ) ? bkj .

Otherwise, it is easy to show that aki ? wij ? bkj . From above, we can get that for all k ? K , i ? K and j ? M ,  aki ? wij ? bkj . (9)  Similarly, for any k ? K , i ? K and j ? M , if bkj > aki , then it follows from the definition of Go?del dual fuzzy coimplication operator that  aki ? wij = aki ? (  K? k=1  ( aki ??? b  k  j  ))  ? aki ? ( aki ??? b  k  j  ) = aki ? b  k  j  = b k  j .

Otherwise, it is easy to show that aki ?wij ? aki ? bkj . Thus, we have shown that for any k ? K , i ? K , and j ? M ,  aki ? wij ? b k  j . (10)  According to (9) and (10), we can get that for all k ? K and j ? M ,  n? i=1  ( aki ? wij  ) ? bkj , n? i=1  ( aki ? wij  ) ? bkj . (11) The combination of Definition 4 and (11) leads to  Ak ? W ? Bk. (12) Now, we conclude that for all k ? K , Ak ? W = Bk.

This completes the proof of Theorem 1. ?

V. NUMERICAL EXAMPLE  In this section, an illustrative example is given to demon- strate the validity of our proposed learning rule. The intu- itionistic fuzzy pattern pairs are shown in Tab. I. According to the proposed learning rule, we can obtain the weight matrix of IFAM  W =  ? ??????????  < 0.6, 0.4 > < 0.6, 0.5 > < 0.7, 0 > < 0.4, 0.2 > < 0.6, 0.2 > < 0.8, 0.2 > < 0.4, 0.2 > < 0.6, 0.2 > < 1.0, 0.1 > < 0.4, 0.4 > < 0.4, 0.5 > < 1.0, 0 > < 0.6, 0 > < 0.4, 0.5 > < 0.7, 0 >  < 1.0, 0.1 > < 0.6, 0.2 > < 0.6, 0.2 >  ? ??????????  It is easy to verify that IFAM with the above matrix W can achieve perfect association of these pairs {Ak, Bk}8k=1, i.e., Ak ? W = Bk hold for all k = 1, 2, ? ? ? , 8.
