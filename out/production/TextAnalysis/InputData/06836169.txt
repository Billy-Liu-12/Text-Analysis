Abstract? This paper describes an Open Architecture, multi- resolution, distributed design and simulation tool for rapid analysis and optimization of a general class of complex systems, composed of coupled, interacting sub-systems or components. Such complexity is well exemplified by cooling systems in ground vehicles with hybrid powerplants, which typically consist of multiple sub-systems. Distributed, multi- resolution simulations sidestep these difficulties by: a) partitioning the system into interacting components that can be represented by models of varying levels of fidelity; and b) executing the component models in parallel, with each model exchanging information with the others in real time. The subsystems can be coupled to one another through the interactions of selected elements. Vehicle tests were conducted to evaluate the modeling approach. Prototyping and validation examples are given multi-component systems used for cooling of hybrid powerplants over a wide range of operating conditions. Simulation results were compared to experimental data gathered at component and vehicle levels. Most of the model predictions deviated from the test data by less than 5%.

Results indicate that distributed multi-resolution simulations can significantly accelerate the analysis of flow-thermal processes in complex vehicle systems. Moreover, the approach allows coupling of different codes with different functionalities to obtain integrated results not possible with any one individual code.
