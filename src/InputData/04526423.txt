Bayesian Extreme Value Statistics for Novelty Detection in Gas-Turbine Engines

Abstract We present a novel method for the identification of abnormal episodes in gas-turbine vibration data, in which we show 1) how a model of normal engine behaviour is constructed using signatures of "normal" engine vibration response; 2) how extreme value theory (EVT), a branch of statistics used to determine the expected value of extreme values drawn from a distribution, can be used to set novelty thresholds in the model, which, if exceeded, indicate an "abnormal" episode; 3) application to large data sets of modem gas-turbine flight data, which shows successful novelty detection results with low false-positive alarm rates.
