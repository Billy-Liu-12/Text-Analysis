LCD colorimetric characterization based on  Quadratic polynomial

Abstract?In this paper, according to the analysis of ICC standard and characterization profiles, every color channel is divided into 16 grades by using the program C++. Color square is measured accurately by using X-rite spectrophotometer. Using the ICC uniform color space, quadratic polynomial model of RGB-CIEXYZ are founded, which are crossed curve fitting, calculating color error, analyzing accurate. Thus the models are improved. Based on the study of the relationship between digital drive value and the spectral data, tone/matrix model in color management modeling of display characterization is established by using quadratic polynomial fitting. In the case of big conversion error, using an optimization quadratic polynomial model can make the chromatic difference reduced significantly, so that the conversion accuracy will be improved.
