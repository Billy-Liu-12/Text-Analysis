Abstract?As the recent advent of the internet, most of the modern firms are now geared towards using the web technology in their daily as well as strategic activities. The web mining technology provides them with unprecedented ability to analyze web log data, which are seemingly full of useful information, but often lack of important and meaningful information. This indicates the need to develop an advanced inference mechanism extracting richer implication from the web mining results. In this sense, this paper presents a new algorithm of web mining, which is aimed at enriching the interpretation of the draft results of association rule mining. The proposed algorithm in this paper was built based on apriori algorithm proposed by Agrawal and Srikant, and contains the first support, the second support and Rel-confidence, and has been extensively used for the web mining recently. Finally, with an illustrative web log database, the obtained results prove the robustness of the proposed algorithm in this paper. However, there is still space for improvement. The future work should still consist of more experiments with other web log data sets to optimize the proposed algorithms.

I.  INTRODUCTION  With the abundance of information available on the World Wide Web (WWW), the issue of how to extract useful knowledge from the Web has gained significant attention among researchers in data mining and knowledge discovery areas. It is said number of online users worldwide exceeded one billion in 2005 ? up from only 45 million in 1995, and the number is expected to increase to two billion by 2011[1].

Jupiter Research projects that online retail sales will continue to rise to a level of around $144 billion in 2010, when the Internet will influence nearly half of total retail sales [2].

In today?s competitive business environment, Web services have become an absolute necessity for organizations, not only to distribute and collect information but also to discover useful patterns from collected data[3-5]. Knowledge gained from collected data can then be used to develop business strategies. Many organizations have begun implementing value-added services on the Web to gain competitive advantage and create loyal customers. In order to make the Web more user-friendly for individuals and create long-term relationships with them, companies now realize that providing personalized products and services is crucial. This type of personalization can be achieved through a variety of methods focused on discovering each individual?s needs[6-7]. Web mining enables extraction of such knowledge for  personalization and improved Web services[8].

Web mining refers to the effort of Knowledge Discovery in  Data (KDD) from the web. It can be defined as the process of applying data mining techniques to extract useful knowledge from the huge amount of information available from the web[9]. Web mining has the same objective as data mining in that both attempt to search for variable and meaningful knowl -edge from web log and database[10-11]. However, web mining is different from data mining in that the former is more illstructured task than the latter[12]. Source of such difference is based on the characteristics of web documents or log files which represent unstructtiredness with little machine-read -able semantics while data-mining is aimed at dealing with more structural database and extracting knowledge[13].

Web mining is often categorized into three major areas[14]:web content mining, web structure mining  and web usage mining. Web content mining [15] is the process of extracting knowledge from the content of a number of web documents. Web structure mining [16] is the process of inferring knowledge from the organization and links on the web, while web usage mining is the automatic discovery of user access patterns from web servers. The web content mining [17] is related with using the web search engines, main role of which is to discover the web contents according to the user?s requirements and constraints.

In recent years, the web content mining approach by using the traditional search engines is migrating into (intelligent) agent-based mining [18] and database-driven mining. The agents which are intelligent soft-ware for specific tasks support the search towards more relevant web contents by taking domain characteristics and user profiles into consideration more intelligently. They also help users interpret the discovered web contents. Many agents for Web structure includes external structure, internal structure, and URL itself. External structure mining [19] is therefore related to investigating hyperlinked relationships between web pages under consideration, while internal structure; mining analyzes the relationships of information within the web page. URL mining [20] is to extract URL that is relevant to decision maker?s purpose. Web usage mining is to apply the concept of data mining to the web log file data, and automatically discover user access patterns towards a specific web page.

Another source for the web usage mining is referrer logs, which contain information about the referring pages for each page reference, and user registration or survey data gathered     via CGI scripts. Results of the web usage mining provide decision makers with crucial information about the lifetime value of customers, cross-marketing strategies across products, and effectiveness of promotional campaigns. Among other things, the web usage mining [21] helps organization analyze user access patterns to targeting ads or web pages, categorize user preferences, and restructure a web site to create more effective management of workgroup communication and organizational infrastructure.

This paper deals with web usage mining, for which many data mining techniques such as statistical analysis, clustering, classification, association rules, sequential pattern discovery, and dependency modeling have been applied to web server logs. Among these, association rules, which has been one of the most frequently used techniques, forms the focus of this study.

In the following sections, literature review is briefly introduced in Section 1. In section 2, we elaborate the idea of association rule mining. In section 3, we present the algorithms for web usage mining. In section 4, an illustrative example is given to illustrate how to utilize the method. And the result is provided with the illustrative example. Finally, conclusions are presented in Section 5.



II.  ASSOCIATION RULES MINING  Among the data mining techniques, association rules mining [22] has been popular in marketing intelligence fields.

However, we apply the association rules mining technique to the web mining task. First, association rule mining is derived from data mining approach, which is known to efficiently discover meaningful rules from large collections of data.

However, the association rule mining focuses on finding association rules like X?Y with support A% and confidence B%, where X and Y are sets of items, from the transactions in database. The rule means that the transaction records in database that contain X tend to contain Y. The support A % of the rule X?Y is the percentage of transactions that contain X.

The rule X?Y holds in the transactions database with confidence B%, if B% of transactions that support X also support Y. In other words, the support represents the usefulness of the discovered association rules, while the confidence indicates certainty of the detected association rules.

Therefore, the objective of the association rule mining is to discover all rules that have support and confidence greater than the user-specified minimum support and minimum confidence. This definition of the association rule mining indicates that many redundant rules may be found, which also justifies the algorithm presented in this paper to develop a new web mining approach to enrich the inference from the results of web mining like association rule mining [23].

Apriori algorithm [24], which is adopted in this paper as one of the association rule mining techniques, is one of the prevalent association rule mining techniques. Apriori algorithm operates in two phases. In the first phase, all transaction sets are generated with the downward closure property of support. In the second phase, the association rules  are generated from all the transaction sets.

Our proposed algorithm is composed of the first support,  the second support and Rel-confidence. The first stage is to extract association rules from the web log database in which all the web surfing log files users made on a target web site are stored. The reason why we use association rules is that a web site indicates a set of interrelated hyperlinks each of which may represent either a menu, a data set , a figure, or another web document, etc., and that the objective of the web mining is usually to find out the hidden informative relationship between those inter-related hyperlinks users visited while web surfing.



III.  DESCRIBING METHODOLOGY  To find out the hidden informative relationship between those inter -related hyperlinks users visited while web surfing, a new algorithm of discovering association rules that contain the first support, the second support and Rel-confidence is presented in this paper.

K-candidate item sets, where k is the number of data items in its each itemset, is represented as Ck. Ik represents the candidate itemset from Ck. Ik.support represents the support for candidate itemset Ik. The algorithms for generating frequent itemsets that include semi-frequent itemsets are provided as follows: Algorithm1 (function for generating candidate itemsets, candi-gen(Lk-1))  if (k=2)  then  insert into Ck; select  p.iteml; q.item1 from L1  else insert into Ck select  p.iteml; p.item2;?; p.itemk-1; q.itemk-1 where  p.item1=q.item1, ?, p.itemk-2=q.itemk-2,  p.itemk-1 < q.itemk-1Algorithm2: D: Database (a set of transactions) I = i1, i2, . . . , in: a set of data items accessed by all  transactions in D C1 ={ i1, i2, . . . , ik}; for ( ik?I) if  (ik.support?1st support)   then  ik?L1 else if (ik.support?2nd support)   then  ik?L1 else  remove ik from C1 end for (k=2; Lk-1 != ?; k++) do  Ck = Candi-gen(Lk-1); T = { }; for all transactions t in D do Ct ={ };  /* Ct ={Ik | Ik?Ck and all data items in Ik  are included by transaction t}*/ for all Ik?Ck do if (all data items in Ik are included by transaction t ) then  Ct = Ct?Ik     end for all candidates Ik?Ck  do Ik.count++ End T = T?Ct  end for all candidates Ik in T do if (Ik.count?1st support)  then  Lk ={ Ik| Ik?T and  Ik.count?1st support} else Rel-confidence (i1, i2, ? , ik) = max(sup(i1, i2, ? ,  ik)/sup(i1), sup(i1, i2, ? , ik)/sup(i2), ?, sup(i1, i2, ? , ik)/sup(ik))  if (Ik.count?2nd support and Ik. max-conf?min-conf) then  Lk ={ Ik| Ik?T and Ik. max-conf?min-conf } else  remove Ik from Ck  end Answer =?k Lk  end

IV.  ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE  To begin with, it is noteworthy that the original web log data is  contaminated by several types of irrelevant, void and redundant information, for example, filename suffixes such as gif, jpeg, map, and count. cgi, etc. To mine a meaningful set of association rules from the web log database, the first step to be done is to preprocess or cleanse the target web log data 50 that the preprocessed web log data may become more traceable to specific web documents, and free from redun- dant or meaningless noisy information such as local caches, corporate firewalls, proxy servers, etc. After preprocessing task, the target web log data becomes clean and ready for further web mining procedures. It is customary to sort out the preprocessed web log data file by the same IP address because an unidentified user leaving some trails on the web log database can be identified uniquely by his/her own IP address.

Table 1 shows raw web log database and the corre-sponding preprocessed web log database.

The web mining algorithm we adopted here is the one proposed  above, which is built basing on the known Apriori Algorithm. Based on the preprocessed web log database in Table 1. The corresponding association rules were extracted with a threshold of 60% confidence. Table 1 shows an excerpt of the derived association rules.

For example, it is very difficult for decision makers to clarify and find out the directly and indirectly     chained  association rules such as A ? B ? C ? D, which seem to play an important role in providing valuable interpretation. In addition, the association rules generating  algorithm usually results in redundant rules too much and fails to yield logical inter-relationships between important factors worthy of being noted by decision makers.
