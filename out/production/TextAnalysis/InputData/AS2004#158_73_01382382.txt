Introduction data mining; visualization; visval data mining; parallel Data mining is a process which can extract connotative, unknown before and latent knowledge from hugely incomplete, blurry and random data. However, data mining envisage gigantic amount of database or data warehouse. Its process is time-consuming and technology-complex, and it can find a great deal of unused noise data and knowledge. Therefore, in the data mining process, we should use the effective way to observe the distributing and structure of data clearly, to understand the mutual relation and developing trend of data and to catch on the process and results of data mining. The Visual Data Mining (VDM) combined by data visualization and data mining can provide a effective way to solve this problem.

This paper summarizes current data mining technologies and tools, and presents a visual data mining tool VisDM-PC based on parallel coordinate. This tool includes many functions: open database connection, data exhibition, data analysis and human-machine interaction.

We have applied VisDM-PC in many data minipg fields.

2. High dimensional data visualization and its parallel coordinate representation Presently, there are many ways for data visualization, such as: (1) Geometry based; (2) Pixel base4 (3)Icon based; other technologies etc[11'21[31. In the visualization ways mentioned above, Parallel coordinate based on icon represent high dimensional data set as 2 dimension icon.

This way is the same with very high dimensional data sets in which the amount of data objects is not much, we can observe the distribution and structure of data directly according parallel coordinate.

Parallel coordinate is one of the muliti-dimensional data visual technologies represented by two dimensional for"41[s1. Its-basic idea is that the description of a higher dimensional object is captured, to a considerable extent, in the 2-dimensional representation of the envelops of the polygonal lines representing its points. Points are denoted by capitals, and lines (or arcs of curves) by lower-case letters respectively. On the plane with xy-Cartesian coordinates, and stating on the y-axis, N copies of the real line, labeled xl,x2, - * * , XN, are placed equidistant and perpendicular to the x-axis. Figure1 is an illustration that parallel coordination represents a point in high dimensional  data space.

I i" X I Figure 1, Parallel coordinate representation of a point in 3-D One aait by which Parallel coordinate differs from    One aait by which Parallel coordinate differs from other visual technologies is that Parallel coordinate can not only display data points, but also represent the relation between data. Points on the plane are represented by segments between the x 1 and x2-axis. The line 0-7803-8403-2lO4/$20.00 @2004 IEEE Shanghai, 26-29 August 2004 xZ=mxl+b (1) is the collection of points A(Figure 2), the distance between the xI and xz axes is d. The l i e  on the ~ 1 x 2 -  Cartesian which, when mf I ,  intersect at the point: Given with respect to the xy-Cartesian Coordinates.

When m=l, we consider x y to be projected in parallel coordinates as parallel lines, which gives tangent direction, it can be thought as ideal point with slope m.

vi (0,  a,) Figure 2. Duality induced in the plane by parallel coordiiates In the parallel coordinates, the intersecting point is defined by the slope of line in xy-Cartesian. It follows that the intersecting point is to the right of the x2-axis , for h &lt; l ,  on the ship between the axes for mcO, and to the left of the x,-axis when ml. Horizontal and vertical lines are represented by points on the x and x-axis respectively.

Figure 4. Pamllel coordinate representation of lines in 10-dimension Compared with traditional Caxtesian coordinates, the main merit of parallel coordinates is that the dimension amount decides the width of screen, it need not use vector or other visual icons. When the dimension amount increases, it is difficult for the traditional coordinate to represent data information. When the data set is very large, many overlapping lines make the folding density large, hierarchy is faint, users identified them difficultly. So we organize the data set by hierarchy and induct interaction ways to decrease confusion.

3. Visual data minhg tool based on parallel coordinate: ViDM-PC VisDM-PC which developed from IBM VisualAge for 1 245 JAVA V4.0 can be applied by any browsers.

3.1. Description of the VisDM-PC VisDM-PC includes the following aspects: * User Interface: it can submit the user's query and    * User Interface: it can submit the user's query and knowledge discovery requirements according the buttons and mouse drag; + Database: it can receive data from the multi database and data warehouse; * Data Preprocessing: it normalizes the data before visualization according to it, so the data can be showed in the parallel coordinates; * Data Visualization: users can select and observe any subsets from the whole data in graphics; * Interaction: data selection, graphical color, graphical properties etc can be defined freely; * Development Plat: this system is developed by IE3M Visual Age for JAVA V5.0; + Applications: it can be applied in commerce, finance, science, education and information management etc 3.2. Functions of ViDM-PC The system structure of VisDM-PC is showed in Figure 5: (1) Database Linking: VisDM-PC can provide information source by loading the data from existent database or data warehouse; (2) Data Classification: data classification is to find a set of models or functions to describe the typical features of data sets; (3) Data Mean: the arithmetical data arithmetical mean is the trend of data measurement, interacting parallel coordinate can not only give the average data mean of whole data, also show the data arithmetical mean of any data subsets; (4) Box Plot: box plot represents the discrete grade by the quarter. Box graph signs the 25th Soth, 75th data, the stretch of box graph represent the maximum and minimum value; (5) Coordinates Exchange: if the coordinates are neighborhood, user will be more easily to observe and compare the corresponding data. VisDM-PC can exchange the coordinate so as to help user compare the data.

(6) Correlation Analysis: users select the data interested and compute the relationship by the following formula: (5) n i s  the number of data object, Avg(A) and AV@) are the average mean in attribute A and B respectively. SA and S, are the variances normalized.

If DO, then it denotes that they are positive correlation, r is much bigger which represents one attribute includes another attribute more possibly; If r=O, then it denotes that they are independent; If r &lt;O, then it denotes that negative correlation, one attribute will prevent another athibute appearing.

(7) Correlation Rules: correlation rules are the pattem knowledge come forth frequently from given. data sets.

They like X=&gt;Y etc. VisDM-PC set two rules Minimum Support and Minimum Confidence which Gill be showed by the area and color of region; Ordinary correlation rules mining algorithms can mine plentiful strong correlation rules, there are many redundancy and useless in them, so this will affect users' support and confidence to system. Our system will let users select data and compute the support and confidence of them.

In fact, the correlation rules are given by the user, which have s&amp;nger purpose. User need not know the program or computing ways of correlation rules which are showed in visualization to represent the correlation grade of data by VisDM-PC; (8) Roll-up and Drill-down: data mining need sometimes to analyze data in hierarchy. The transformation between different bierarchies are named roll-up and drill-down. VisDM-PC will display the roll-up and drill-down in visualization.

drill-down in visualization.

The applications of VisDM-PC in data mining 33.1 Datasource Our VisDM-PC bas applied to human resource, education, finance etc. The following we will give an example of Chinese 2000 CET(Col1ege English Test) scores to explain the application of VisDM-PC. Our data sets include 6 attributes: Listening (20), Reading (40).

Words (15). Closing (lo), Writing (15) andTotal (100). We 26-29 A u p t  2004 will represent the six attributes using six coordinates, data source consist of 246 scores, so we can get the following useful information: Listening and Writing. These information will instruct ow teaching.

33.2 The data?s basic character 1). Data classification and average value User can choose classification mode. Figure 6 classified the data by 20 scores which could get five classifications which are showed in different colors. We may observe syllabify the classifications accordmg the colors. Figure 7 is the compare of average value of all sub-classifications. We can know there is little difference between high and low scores in writing, so we can conclude the high score students have not advantage in 6:DiffereG colors.comsp&amp;dmg to the Classification = v P E P P a &amp; ; 3 r v 1 I I i I Figure 7. The compare of average value 2). Box plot . The box plot is illustrated as Figure 8. The top line of the box denotes 25%. the bottom line of the box denotes 75% and the line in the box denotes SO%, the mark line above and below the box denote 10% and YO% respectively According to the box plot, we can find that there have beyond 50% students? scores are higher average score in Reading, Words, Closing, but the other way around in 3.3.3 The analysis of data correlation Figure 9 illustrates the correlation between attributes.

The correlation measure of different attributes are among 0.3-0.6, the correlation of single attribute and Total are between 0.5-0.9. These information reflect the relationship of students? different skills in education.

I-- Figure 9. The correlation of Reading and Words 33.4 Relating data mining VisDM-PC can illustrate the relating rules of different attributes in visualization. Figure 10 illustrate the analysis of relating rules between writing and reading, Different colors in the filliig triangle illustrate represent the Support anu Lonrioence.

e- a,, * - Figure 10. The correlation of writing and reading, 26-29 August 2004 Suppose the Reading score is 22 and Writing score is based on parallel coordinates, and illustrated the application 9, then the Support S=49% and the Confidence C=85%. So of data visualization in data mining. It inuoduced the we can get the relating rule as following: parallel coordinates, discussed the traits of VisDM- FT WRITING(X. ?&gt;Y) =&gt; READING o(. ?522%~. which orovided human-machine interactive methods and    and .-.

[Support = 49%. Confidence = 85% ] The rule above told us the students which Writing score are higher the average value is beyond 49% (Support), at the same time, the student$ which Writing scores are higher the average value and Reading scores are higher the average value IS beyond 85% (Support). Whereas, we can get another relating rule as following: READING(X, ?522?) =&gt; wRrrING(X. ?5Y) [ Support =78%, Confidence=53%] We can analyze other relating rules of other attributes by using the same way.

3.3.5 Roll-up and drill down Figure 11. Roll-up and drill down of the data Figure 11 is one example of roll-up and drill-down.

The scores beyond 80 and beyond 60 in CET-4 are very important, so we roll-up the scores as beyond 80, 60-80, 40-60 and below 40. If roll up one level, we can only see the trend of passing (&gt;=60) and not passing (&lt;60), so we can observe and analyze the data expediently. The thickness of l i e  represent the size of data sets.

? 4. Conclusions This paper developed one visual data mining system led user to perform data mining. V~~DM-PC realized the classification, relating rules, correlation, roll-up and drill-down function and the other visual representation.
