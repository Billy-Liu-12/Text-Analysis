On Application of association rule-based data mining technology to scientific  projects declaration  ling Xu  Ningbo Dahongying University Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, P.R.China  E-mail:housebug@sina.com  Ahstract-The declaration of research projects is one of the crucial criteria for the scientific research level of a university.

Research data collected in recent years in universities has not been put into effective use. This paper aims to find the co-relation between the indicator of declaration and the other 9 indicators including the team structure, the project level, the research foundation, etc. The paper finds 11 effective strong association rules among all the strong rules by the aid of Apriori algorithm. The paper comes into conclusion that it is more likely for the interdisciplinary research to get approved if its leaders are associate professors with masters' or higher degree and if it has 5-7 members and over 6 research results.

The study will contribute to the successful projects declaration and finally improve the overall scientific research level of the university as a whole.

Keywords-Data Mining, research and management, projects declaration, association rules, Apriori algorithm  In recent years,a large amount of data has been accumulated in research management in colleges and universities; however the management level has always been kept in traditional ways, not fully utilized in a university's research policy making [1].How to make full use of these data to provide decision support for scientific management departments and university administrators becomes an urgent problem for present scientific research filed to be solved [2] [3].

Association rule-based mining method has already been widely used in a mature commercial database in recent years and has also been somehow applied to scientific research management. However, it has never been seen to be involved in scientific research project declaration. This paper aims to discuss the connections between the results of project approval and the information about the project and its members such as the professional titles, the academic backgrounds, research foundations and other information of project members, in order to make guidance for better building scientific research groups, conducting scientific research activities, and improving projects declaration success rate.



I. RESEARCH METHODS  A. Association Rules  Association rule-based mmmg could help to find interesting connections or relationships among large amount of data item sets[4], which is one of the techniques of data    mmmg. As of association, it means certain connections among two or more variables, like "simultaneous" or "one object brings out another"[5]. Such kind of connection is only presented as "symbiosis" which means the two objects are simultaneously present but with no sure cause and effect relationship[6]. In educational and scientific research filed, this connection also exists, the connection between project declaration situation and the professional titles, ages, academic backgrounds, group structures, research foundations of the project leader, and such connection analysis could provide evidence for scientific research decision making.

B. Apriori algorithm  Apriori algorithm uses frequent item sets priori principle whose core principle is based on the theory of frequent item sets search iteration method[ 4].The algorithm will divide the discovery of association rules into two steps, the first step is to identiJY all frequent item sets, which are not less than the minimum support (min_sup) item sets, while the second step is to generate association rules from the frequent item sets, and to find out the rules to meet the user minimum confidence (min_conf)[5] from them.

e. Dynamic clustering analysis  Dynamic clustering method is also called stepwise clustering method. Its basic idea is to choose a group of focal points with a certain method, and then to let the sample focus to the nearest focal points.ln this way the point is focused on the same category to form an initial classification which is not necessarily reasonable, but as soon as the sample is classified new center of gravity will be calculated to take place of the original focal points, and then the classification of the next sample will be calculated until all the samples are properly classified[7].

The main computational steps are as follows: Step l. Normalization of raw data Step 2.To select a predetermined number of focal points  and conduct initial classification to the samples.

Step 3. To calculate the center of gravity of each class,  take the center of gravity as new focal point, and recalculate the distance of each sample to new focal point, and classifY it into the nearest focal point category. When the calculated center of gravity identifies with the original focal point the process will be considered to have been accomplished  " otherwise Step 3 will have to be repeated.



II. ASSOCIATION RULES IN PROJECT DECLARATION ApPLICATION  A. Research data  The original data of this paper comes from Ningbo Dahongying University Research Department which collects the university's all declared projects in 20 II, and also the scientific research personnel's data information is called from the university'S personnel management system to Microsoft Excel.

B. Data conversion  Before association rules mmmg, the value of original data variables should be converted into a series of integer or code, and then discretization and assignment processing should be conducted, that is, using a categorical variable to  indicate and to be mapped as transactional database. In order to make the indicators in this paper more rational and scientific, dynamic clustering technique is adopted on the discretization of the numerical interval of these indicators including project leaders' age, number of related research results, number of project teams, proportions of professors and teachers with master degree. Based on the similarity of the index each interval is divided, all the properties are mapped into the index table as is shown in Table 1. After this, by data conversion algorithm each database record is scanned, and then name of each variable is filled into the corresponding position in the transactional data table. When the whole database is scanned using data conversion algorithm, the conversion of relation database into transactional database is considered to be accomplished.

Corresponding transactional data table is shown in Table 2.

Association rules establishment  Based on the professional knowledge and the practical data, a number of experiments have been conducted with the Apriori algorithm. Finally, the minimum support value (min sup) is set at 0.10, while the minimum confidence value (min conf) is 0.80. The rules that meet the both requirements are considered strong association rules and thus analysis of the association rules can be effectively carried out. Totally  973 strong assocIatIOn rules have been made. ThIS paper focuses on the relationship among all indicators and whether to project or not, which is also a constraint condition of association rules. As a result, only 11 strong association rules will be got as is shown in Table 3 after some overlapped rules are deleted and pre and after rules have been sifted from all the strong association rules.

TABLE 3 RULES ON PROJECT AND RELATED RESEARCH INDICATORS  Number Rules Support Confidence 1 Interdisciplinary ? not approved 0.737 0.949  2 Project approved ? interdisciplinary 0.178 0.818  3 Relevant research results number 0-5 ? not approved 0.355 0.991  4 Bachelor ? not approved 0.204 0.816  5 Aged between 27-37 years, intermediate grade, relevant research results number 0-5 ? not approved 0.191 1  6 Intermediate grade, the number of the project team 5-7 people, interdisciplinary ? approved 0.105 0.889  Municipal and department-level project, the number of project team 5-7 people, interdisciplinary ?  0.102 0.838 approved  8 Associate professors, the number of the research results 6-12 ? not approved 0.102 0.912  9 Provincial and ministerial level ? not approved 0.145 0.917  10 Proportions of professors 0-29%, relevant research results number 0-5 ? not approved 0.161 0.98  11 Proportions of master degrees 0-49%, non-disciplinary ? not approved 0.118 0.923  Rule 1: It showed that among all projects, 73.7% of them are not interdisciplinary and not approved; among non-interdisciplinary projects 94.9% of them are not approved. This rule indicates the significance of multidisciplinary research, while the likelihood of the approval of non-interdisciplinary projects is almost zero.

Rule 2: It showed that the content of project research is mostly multidisciplinary. 81.8% of the approved projects are interdisciplinary, which verifies the correctness of Rule 1 on the positive side.

Rule 3: It showed that certain research foundation is required for project application; with the lack of research foundation (0-5) the possibility of disapproval could be as high as 99.1 %.

Rule 4: It showed that the result of the project approved or not is closely connected with the academic background of the project's leader. Teachers with merely bachelor's degree can barely have their projects approved. 81.6% of the projects whose leaders only have bachelor's degree are disapproved. In this case, teachers should be encouraged to pay attention to their academic degree improvement.

Rule 5: It showed that the result of the project is closely related to the leader's age, professional title, and related research foundation. Therefore, lecturers aged between 27 and 37 can hardly get their projects approved unless they have more than 5 research results. Thus, they should make more preparation work in ordinary times, publish more papers at certain research direction, conduct more research, prepare more for declaration of high ranking subjects, make good foundation and at the same time pay attention to title evaluation.

Rule 6: It showed that with reasonable project team structure, and multidisciplinary project content, there is a high possibility for the project approval even if their leaders are only lecturers. For instance, if the number of the project team whose leader is a lecturer is about 5 to 7 people and the projects are interdisciplinary, 88.9% of them are approved.

Rule 7: It showed that as for municipal and department level projects, the reasonable number of a team is about 5 to 7 people, with certain interdisciplinary contents, project possibility will be increased. 83.8% of all the projects that meet the above mentioned requirements are approved.

Rule 8: It showed that for projects whose leaders are associate professor, the requirement of project declaration is higher. The relevant research results ranging 6 to 12 failed to meet with declaration requirements.

Rule 9: It showed that provincial and ministerial level projects are hard to be applied for, with not approved ratio 91.7%. At the present stage, the university level project approval rate is low, which will be the major focus of future efforts.

Rule 10: It showed that in the team of the project, if the proportion of associate professors is between 0 to 29% and research results number ranges from 0 to 5, there will be hardly possible for the project to be approved. Therefore, the proportion of deputy seniors should be increased to meet at least 29%, and relevant research results number at least reach 5.

Rule II: It showed that the academic background of the team members is highly critical. 92.3% of the non-interdisciplinary projects will probably be failed with fewer than 49% of the members do not have master's degree.

From the above mentioned results, it is clear that the longitudinal project approval situation is closely related to its leader and members' academic degrees, titles, team number, relevant research results number, multidisciplinary or not.



III. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION  From all the above, the following conclusions can be drawn:  ? Project leader: at least lecturer, with Master's degree.

It means that teachers should pay attention to their own academic degree promotions as well as professional titles. There is room for the university to make a series of incentive policies, to help young teachers to get promoted and on the other hand boost the school's overall scientific research upgrading;  ? Project team structure: projects of municipal and department level, reasonable personnel number is generally 5-7 people, the number could be increased or decreased as for other projects with practical circumstances. The ratio of teachers with associate    professor titles should be above 29%, while masters above 49%, otherwise the project can be highly denied. Scientific research department could make recommendations according to this analysis result at project declaration stage;  ? Research foundation: this number of relevant research results could vary from person to person, teachers with intermediate grade titles there should be more than 6 relevant research results, while teachers with deputy senior titles the requirement is a little higher at least 12 relevant research results;  ? Multidisciplinary research is encouraged: studies show that the content of the project research when involved with multidisciplinary will greatly enhance the likelihood of project approval, to the contrary, rules show that with no interdisciplinary research the project approval rate is quite low.

? In the course of the study, it is found that the strong association rules are greatly related with intermediate grade teachers, those of whom are pressured by title promotions have higher project declaration enthusiasm, while teachers with senior or deputy senior titles are not so enthusiastic to declare projects which make those higher ranking teachers' potentials not fully used. Therefore, some assessment or incentive policies should be made by the university to build scientific research teams and create academic atmosphere, to better arouse those high ranking teachers' enthusiasm and make them take the lead for others and finally improve the scientific research level of the whole university.

Since the sample data used in this paper is only from the annual project declaration data of one school, the analysis result can be partly restricted due to the school's whole scientific research level. At present, there is no breakthrough on current national level project, and very few provincial and ministerial level projects as well, high level projects related strong association rules can not be obtained yet. Also, there might be some useful rules occurred or abandoned due to the influence of the minimum support and minimum confidence value selection.
