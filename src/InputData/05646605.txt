An Application of Logistic Regression in Cerebral Infraction Disease Detection  Based on Association Rules with Pre-rough Classifier

Abstract - Environment, customs and health status in northwest minority areas have been studied. We found the critical factors to prevent cerebral infraction. First rough sets theory had been used to reduce the attributes, secondly association rules had been used, finally logistic regression model had been used. The model solved the shortcomings of too many rules that caused by attribute redundancy and reliability framework. The results show that the history of  other cerebrovascular disease, alcohol consumption and seasonal change are the significant factors of cerebral infraction.

I. INTRODUCTION  Data mmmg has been a hot issue in knowledge management. The association analysis is widely used.

Association analysis is often used in market analysis, financial data analysis and census areas [II, while in the field of preventive medicine is rare[  21, moreover in the filed of preventive medicine the most difficult thing is too many affecting factors. These factors will lead association analysis often produce lunge redundant rules and rough rules. Hence, we gave some research work on overcoming these difficulties in this paper.

Rough sets theory was firstly introduced by Pawlak in 1982 [  31;[ 41,as a valuable mathematical tool to deal with  vagueness and uncertainty [51. In the Rough set approach, any vague concept is characterized by pair of precise concepts, that is the lower and upper concept approximation [51.Using lower and upper approximation of a set, the accuracy and the quality of approximation can be defined, as well as the knowledge hidden in the data table may be discovered and expressed in the form of decision rules [  61.

Association analysis is used to discover interesting relationships hidden in large data sets. While the Apriori association rules mining algorithm will generate a large number of redundant candidate sets and frequently scanning of the database. In regarding to these shortcomings many scholars have put forward improved algorithms to improve the efficiency. However, in practice, association rules are not as useful as people  Inner Mongolia Natural Science Fund (2009zdI3) National Social Science Fund (05BJY043 ) The National Natural Science Fund (70640008)    expect, a major drawback is that support framework often generate too much confidence rules so we need to use statistical knowledge to add values to the rules. So we will introduce the logistic regression model to do the further statistical test on the rules generated by the association analysis. Separating the major factors to strength the practical direction and deploys a rough classifier model in front of the model. First, reducing attribute, removing redundant attributes, then mining association rules, finally propose the logistic regression (shown in Figure 1), solved the defects of attribute redundancy and too many rules that cause by confidence framework.

The aim of this paper is to studying the complex factors such as environment, health status, customs and medical history in ethnic minority areas in northwest.

Finally we found the significant factors of cerebral infarction are other brain disease history, alcohol consumption and seasonal variation.

II. MODEL APPLICATION: ASSOCIATION RULE MINING IN CEREBRAL lNFRACTION  We integrate the rough collection (Rough Sets) model, the association rules, the Apriori algorithm and the logistic regression model together called RAL(Rough? Apriori-Logistic) model. Then we studied the relations between cerebral infarction patient in the northwest national minority areas with environment, custom, the state of health and the medical history, taken the Inner Mongolian Huhhot first hospital patients as the case. The    aim is to discover the key factors to prevent the cerebral infraction.

The research team has collected 128 patient data from the Inner Mongolian Huhhot first hospital. The data attribute including age, sex, nationality, work, marital condition and so on. We choused the partial samples from cerebral infarction medical records to establish cerebral infarction symptom information table.

We use D to denotes the cerebral infarction patient; a denotes sm (losing sleep); b denotes ty (dizziness); c denotes tt (headache); d denotes em (tinnitus); e denotes tlxj (hearing drop); f denotes qd(pants); g denotes ztwl (body incapable); h denotes swbq(regards thing not clear); i denotes bsbs(paralyzed); j denotes ztmm (body numb); k denotes yybl (language disadvantageous); 1 denotes fycd (slow reaction); m denotes ffot (repeatedly vomit); n denotes jltt (fierce ache); 0 denotes szbq (unconscious); p denotes ebsj (two then incontinence). Cerebral infarction symptom information decision-making table system S=  (U, R, V, F), the attribute set is R= Q U T , Q is the condition attribute, Q= (a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, 1, m, n, 0, p), decision attribute T= (t).

Universe U={X),X2,X3,X4,XS,X6,X7,Xg,X9,X\O,X)),XI2}'  The first step, the cerebral infarction data symptom information decision-making table has been established,  The second step, the Discernibility matrix has been established,  The third step, let Lij = v ai  aiE Cij The fourth step, we obtain the conjunctive normal form.

L /\ L ij Cij *O,Cij *0  We did the mining on the rule of min-support 0.25, min-confidence 0.9, obtained the following results:  Has other blood vessel of brain medical history ==> cerebral infarction  Married, has other blood vessel of brain medical history ==> cerebral infarction  Sex male, has other blood vessel of brain medical history ==> cerebral infarction  Sex male, the breath not normal, has other blood vessel of brain medical history => cerebral infarction  Age> 61, have other blood vessel of brain medical history, not to smoke ==> cerebral infarction  Sex male, married, has other blood vessel of brain medical history => cerebral infarction  Has other blood vessel of brain medical history, non? surgery flesh wound history ==> cerebral infarction   Has hypertension => in the first quarter; Cerebral infarction institution work, non-saccharorrhea medical history, pulse number of times normal => Cerebral infarction  Age> 61, sexes male, first quarter, non-saccharorrhea medical history ==> Cerebral infarction  We got the flowing rules after we let the confidence level down from 0.9 to 0.85.

Has saccharorrhea medical history ==> cerebral infarction  Married, has saccharorrhea medical history ==> cerebral infarction has saccharorrhea medical history, breath not normal ==> cerebral infarction  Drinks => cerebral infarction  Drinks, married ==> cerebral infarction  Drinks, breath abnormal ==> cerebral infarction

III. LOGISTIC REGRESSION OF CEREBRAL INFARCTION INFLUENCE FACTOR  The forward association rules mining have had many rules. We used the logistic regression model to carry on the significance examination of factors that affect cerebral infarction and obtained the results.

According to the association rules mining results we got that the influence factors including other blood vessel of brain medical history, sex, marital condition, age, work, smoking, drink, quarter, diabetes history and so on. The regression model is:  exp( R +px +p x + ... + R X) P( cerebral inf arction ) = P o " 2 2 Pm m 1 + exp(Po + p,X, + P2XZ + ... + PmXm)  X),X2, ... ,Xm are the influence factors.

The dependent variable is the cerebral infarction, the independent variables are other blood vessel of brain medical history, sex, marital condition, age, work, smoking, drink, quarter, diabetes history and so on. The regression result has been showed in the flowing table1.

we can find that the significant influence factors are quarter, other blood vessel of brain medical history, drink and so on. Simultaneously we carried on the correlation analysis to factors, discovered that they don't have the significant co relational dependence between the primary factors.

IV. CONCLUSIONS  By the RAL model analysis, we got the following conclusions,  (1) Having other blood vessel of brain medical history is a remarkable factor. That is if someone who has other blood vessel brain medical history are easier to get the cerebral infarction than others.

(2)Although the cerebral infarction often occurs but often forms the morbidity peak in the seasonal variation.

For example: temperature, barometric pressure, humidity are fierce Change, therefore forms two small peaks in one year, that is spring with winter and fall with winter, we discovered that the third, fourth quarter is the cerebral infarction's incidence, especially the patients with hypertension should pay more attention to the seasonal variation. They should drink more water and wear more clothes.

(3) The 5% are the significance level judgment standards. The non-significance factors of cerebral infarction include, age, sex, national, work, marital condition, saccharorrhea medical history, liver medical history, tuberculosis medical history, kidney medical history and brothers and sisters medical history and   surgery history, smoking, diastolic pressure, wine, uric acid, carbon dioxide, potassium ion, sodium ion, chloride ion and so on.

(4) The research indicated that drinking is an important independent hazard factor of cerebral infraction, while nationality is a correlation factor, not an independent restrictive factor, this is different from former study conclusion.

(5) In the RAL model ,we used rough collection analysis, deductd the complex related attribute, not only enhance the analysis quality but also improve the efficiency compare with not establish the rough collection analysis model (see literature [10] and [11]) . The efficiency has been enhanced 3.2 times.
