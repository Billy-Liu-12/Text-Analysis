INTRODUCTION With the increased use of Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology in advanced military avionic, missile and space applications and the increased data rates advanced FPGA?s are transmitting and receiving data, the need for ruggedized and qualified fiber-optic components is becoming extremely important.  Design engineers considering fiber-optic signal distribution want the same or better reliability from a fiber-optic system that they have with an electronic signal distribution system.  They also require the Built-In-Test (BIT)  and Fault Detection (using optical refractometry)  capability that is present in electrical signal distribution systems.  This paper discusses initial performance characterization data on fiber optic transceivers ruggedized for avionic, missile and space applications.

The transparent substrate allows direct flip-chip attach of Emcore?s VCSEL and PIN 1x4 array devices for ?through substrate? optical communications.  Combined with a corner-turn lens that mates to the parallel optic MT ferrule, a small profile (5 mm height) transceiver module is realized.

Figure 1 shows the transceiver with evaluation board    Figure 1 ? Transceiver, pigtail and eval bard configuration  The fiber pigtail contains 50 micron core ribbon fiber with a silicon-based coating for protection.  The part has an 18 x 18 mm2 gull-wing lead (0.5 mm pitch) PCB footprint with internal AC coupling caps to save end-user board space.

The transceiver contains an internal micro-controller that allows adjustment of operating parameters and forms the BIT function interface.  The current generation transceiver has the capability to measure average transmitted and received optical power on each channel.  These features allow measurement of the fiber optic link loss, one form of ?link-BIT?.

The power consumption is 1.5 W with all channels operating at 2.5 Gbps across the -40C to 100C temperature       profile.

3. PERFORMANCE TESTING We have previously reported the module manufacturing techniques and the concept of OTDR integration for advanced link-BIT [1, 2]. The continuous jitter pattern (CJPAT) was used for jitter and sensitivity testing, according to Fibre Channel and Ethernet specifications [3].

A bit-error-rate tester was used to generate the data pattern and measure sensitivity at a Bit-Error-Rate (BER) of 10-12.

A high speed oscilloscope was used to measure the eye diagrams (an optical channel was used for measuring the transmitter output).   One part was measured at room temperature and the data across four channels was averaged and reported in  Figure 2.

The receiver sensitivity was measured at 1.0625 and 2.125 Gbps, with a resulting 3.4 dB better sensitivity at the lower data rate.  The sensitivity of each channel was measured with the other channel (those not under test) at 9 dBm average optical input power.

Figure 3 shows the eye diagrams for the four transmitter (TX) channels in the left column and four receiver (RX) channels in the right column.  Note: a 3.2 Gbps filter was used t measure the TX channels to remove the high frequency noise of the oscilloscope.

The performance of the fiber optic transceiver is intertwined with the packaging aspects, such the optical coupling method, high speed signal routing and the thermal path between the transceiver IC and case.

4. SINGLE EVENT UPSET TESTING SEU Set-Up  The schematic of the test set-up is shown in figure 4.  Two quad transceivers were used in this set-up.  The ?transceiver under test? was placed in a radiation beam and another was place outside of the beam. Serializer/deserializer (SERDES) devices drove four data channels into the transmit-side of the transceiver in the radiation beam (on left side of figure).

The transceiver converted this data to optical signals that were brought into the receiver side of a second transceiver not in the beam.  The output of the receiver was input back into the SERDES, closing the data loop.  The SERDES had a self-check feature, transmitting a pseudo random bit stream of length 7 (PRBS7) pattern and checking for errors against the received pattern.  A computer was set-up to monitor errors.  The computer also monitored the devices current supply draw and temperature.  To test the receiver, the loop was repeated in reverse direction (as shown in the right side of the Fig. 4)  SERDESSERDES  ERROR CHECK  Transceiver (in BEAM)  Transceiver (not in BEAM)  SERDES OUT  SERDES IN     fib er  o pt  ic li  nk  electrical link  electrical link  SERDES OUT  SERDES IN     fib er  o pt  ic li  nk  electrical link  electrical link  SERDES IN  SERDES OUT     fiber optic link  electrical link  electrical link  TX RX  RX TX   Figure 4: Schematic of SEU test set-up.

The SERDES device used in this testing was a Texas Instruments TLK2051, capable of data rates between 1.5 Gbps to 2.5 Gbps.

Since heavy ions do not penetrate the normal transceiver packaging materials, provisions were made to allow direct access to the silicon-on-sapphire (SOS) transceiver IC.  Our packaging method normally places a ?thermal plug? near the surface of the transceiver IC.  For this test, the thermal plug was removed and the package was re-designed to remove heat from the non-circuit side of the SOS substrate (Figure 5).

Figure 5 also shows the method of packaging for radiation testing. The high speed signal I/O was provided by SMA  cabling along the perimeter of the PCB.  There are four differential pairs (8 cables) with electrical data entering the transceiver and four differential pairs with data exiting.

The 8 fiber channels (4 transmitting and 4 receiving) were connected to transceiver in a 6? long ribbon cable.  This ribbon cable is looped up and connected to another longer cable that connects the two transceivers.

Since the penetration of heavy ions into GaAs is roughly 30 microns, the radiation is not reaching the VCSEL or PIN device, whose GaAs substrates are 200 microns thick.

Therefore, this radiation testing was isolated to the transceiver circuitry.

SEU TESTING RESULTS  Heavy ion SEU testing was performed at the Tandem Van de Graaf facility at Brookhaven National Labs.  We performed testing on four parts with particle LETs from 13.14 (Cl) to 81.28 (Au) MeV-cm2/mg.   The transceiver link was tested at data rates of 1.6 Gbps, 2.0 Gbps and 2.5 Gbps and at supply voltages of 3.15 V, 3.3 V and 3.45 V.

The temperature of the part within the chamber was 55 ?C.

The transmitted optical power was fixed at -3 dBm with 7 dB extinction ratio on each transmitter channel.   The beam particle flux was set to 1 ? 10 5  ions/cm2-s and the testing was run for 100 seconds for a total fluence of 1 ? 10 7  ions/cm2 (except for SN 4, which was tested at a flux of 1 ? 10 7  ions/cm2-s ? it was found that this level began to degrade the part, so the remainder of the parts were tested at 1 ? 10 5  ions/cm2-s).

To determine a cross-section (the sensitivity to upsets), we summed up the errors that occurred within the transmitter, receiver and control logic.  In other words, any error that occurred within the part is counted as an upset.  Figure 6 shows the test results.    The four parts we measured showed consistent results across the LET range tested.

We tested 4 devices at rates ranging from 1.6 to 2.5 Gbps per channel on 4 transmit and 4 receive channels running simultaneously.  This plot is a summation of any error occurring in the transmit path, receive path or internal configuration logic.

The data is assumed to follow a Weibull distribution, which is curve fit to SN 2 at 2.5 Gbps and 1.6 Gbps.  Using the x- axis intercept as an estimation of SEU threshold, we find at 2.5 Gbps threshold is above 20 Mev/gm/cm2 and at 1.6 Gbps the threshold is above 25 Mev/gm/cm2.

5. TOTAL DOSE TESTING Total-dose radiation testing was completed using a Co-60 gamma source at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, CA (figure 7).

Figure 7: Physical setup of test hardware in radiation beam.

Two irradiation runs were completed.  ?Experiment #1? accumulated a dose of roughly 30 kRad(Si).  ?Experiment #2? accumulated a dose of 100 kRad(Si).  The procedures generally followed MIL-STD-883 Method 1019.7, however these were not intended as a qualification test. The dose rate in both cases was maintained at 23 rad/minute.   A transceiver module, referred to here at the Device Under Test (DUT), was irradiated in both experiments.  This device was operated at room temperature during radiation.

Experiment #1 showed that the transceiver had good fundamental radiation hardness.  In particular, both the Tx and Rx high speed performance, including Rx sensitivity, were comparable to pre-radiation levels.  However, this experiment did show radiation sensitivity in regards to various precision analog functionalities.  This result was somewhat unexpected given the known properties of Silicon-on-Sapphire (SOS).  Further investigation revealed that a key difference between the transceiver module construction and prior SOS application is the lack of a ground plane at the back of the SOS die.  The ground plane is believed to provide a discharge path for ionized charge.

To test the effect of the ground plane, we added an auxiliary (AUX) board in Experiment #2.  The AUX board is a stripped down module in which the lens and fiber coupling have been removed to expose the back of the SOS die.  The back of the die was coated with conductive silver epoxy (cured) which was connected to electrical ground.  In Experiment #2 the DUT and AUX boards were exposed to 100 kRad radiation.  The AUX data shows that the grounding of the SOS die eliminates the majority of the radiation effects.

Some radiation sensitivity did remain in the VCSEL power monitoring function. This effect was seen to saturate at approximately 20 kRad.  Mitigation of this effect by pre- irradiation of the modules would be an option.

6. CONCLUSIONS This paper shows fiber optic transceiver performance over temperature along with initial characterization SEU and Total Dose radiation testing.  LET?s greater that 20 Mev/mg/cm2 were observed although the GaAs VCSEL and PINs probably were not properly radiated as heavy ions might not have penetrated through the 200um GaAs substrates.  Total Dose of >100Krad(Si) was observed and with proper grounding, it?s expected that better results will be seen in the future.
