Abstract?On September 21st, 2013, the High Energy  Replicated Optics to Explore the Sun, or HEROES, balloon-  borne x-ray telescope launched from the Columbia Scientific  Balloon Facility?s site in Ft. Sumner, NM. The flight lasted for  ~27 hours and the observational targets included the Sun and  astrophysical sources GRS 1915+105 and the Crab Nebula.

Over the past year, the HEROES team upgraded the existing  High Energy Replicated Optics (HERO) balloon-borne  telescope to make unique scientific measurements of the Sun  and astrophysical targets during the same flight. The HEROES  Project is a multi-NASA Center effort with team members at  both Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) and Goddard  Space Flight Center (GSFC), and is led by Co-PIs (one at each  Center). The HEROES payload consists of the hard X-ray  telescope HERO, developed at MSFC, combined with several  new systems. To allow the HEROES telescope to make  observations of the Sun, a new solar aspect system was added  to supplement the existing star camera for fine pointing during  both the day and night. A mechanical shutter was added to the  star camera to protect it during solar observations and two  alignment monitoring systems were added for improved  pointing and post-flight data reconstruction. This mission was  funded by the NASA HOPE (Hands-On Project Experience)  Training Opportunity awarded by the NASA Academy of  Program/Project and Engineering Leadership, in partnership  with NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Office of the Chief  Engineer and Office of the Chief Technologist.
