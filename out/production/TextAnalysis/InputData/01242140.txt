I. WTRODUCTION  The primary application of group technology (GT) is in the cellular manufacturing design. The grouping of machine cells and their associated part families so as to minimize the cost of material handling is a major step in cellular manufacturing. Each manufacturing cell includes a group of various machines that are physically close together and can expectantly process a family of parts completely  Hyer and Wemmerlov [12] divided cellular manufacturing problems into two categories: system structure problems and system operation problems. System structure problems include: ( I )  grouping parts into families; (2) grouping machines and processes into cells; (3) selection of tools, fixtures and pallets; (4) selection of material handling equipment; and (5) choice of equipment layout. The first two issues are commonly addressed together, and are also referred to as cell formation (CF). The operational problems include: ( I )  formation of maintenance and inspection policies; and (2) design of procedures for production planning, scheduling, and control.

The reduction in set-up time and material handling in cellular manufacturing can he realized by take advantage of the similarities of production process rather than by increasing the lot size. This leads to significant advantages in work-in-progress reduction, throughput time reduction, material handling cost reduction, scheduling simplification, product flow simplification, and quality improvement [ 1 I].

For further details of cellular manufacturing, readers are referred to Burbidge [4], Offodile e/uL [20] and Brandon [3].

The cell formation problem is NP-complete and involves complicated combinatorial optimization [ 131. Hence,  Technology Taipei, Taiwan, ROC  most of the procedures are heuristic in nature. Many approaches have been applied to resolve the cell formation problem. They include array-based clustering methods, hierarchical and non-hierarchical clustering methods, graph theoretic methods and mathematical programming [lo, 12, 13, 16, 17, 20, 21, 22, 251. Some modem heuristics such as neural networks, simulated annealing, genetic algorithms and Tabu search [25] have been applied to the design of cellular manufacturing systems.

In modem data mining techniques, the association rule induction method can identify the closeness measures among items. When arranging machine cells in cellular manufacturing processes, data mining can be employed to discover beneficial information from the manufacturing process data. In data mining, association rules are descriptive patterns of the form X =$ Y , where X and Y are statements about the values of attributes of an instance in a database. The most famous example of an association rule was murket bus& unu&xir, in which the market basket consists of the set of items purchased by a customer on a single store visit. In cellular manufacturing, the association rule induction can be adopted to identify the closeness among machines.

The patiems of parts being processed on machines can be analyzed with association rules. With respect to these rules, the configuration of machine cells in manufacturing systems can be determined. Machines processing the same family of parts could have close associations, and these can be grouped jointly. The association function can he applied to the machinelcomponent process data and performed to fmd relationships among machines. A closeness based clustering method is used to group machine cells by 0-1 integer programming. This paper aims to develop a cell formation approach based on association rule mining and clustering approach for designing the cellular manufacturing systems.

11. THE GT CELL FORMATION  Cell formation arranges the production around machine cells that are capable of manufacturing part families with similar process requirements. In the production flow analysis, cell formation techniques generally operate on the machine-part matrix (machinelcomponent incidence matrix, d c  matrix), selection of product mix, and data collection on parts in the product mix [3,5].

The binary version of the cell formation problem is  0-7803-7736-2/03/$17.00 02003 IEEE 3554    considered herein. It is usually illustrated by an d c  matrix A,, = {ai}, in which rn is the number of machines, and n is number of components (parts). The d c  matrix represents the machining requirements of parts in the product mix. Each element in the d c  matrix can assume two values, Q?and ?1?.

A ?I? entry indicates that the part of the corresponding column has an operation on the machine of the corresponding row. A Q? entry indicates the opposite. The m/c matrix with zerolone entries is the major input to cell formation algorithms, which form the machine-part groups. The information given by the d c  matrix shown in Figure 1 illustrate a case that produces 6 parts using 5 machines. Zeros are not displayed to avoid crowding the matrix. The value of a*,] is equal to ?1; thus, Part 3 needs an operation on Machine 2. In contrast, Part 3 does not need an operation on Machine 1 since q1 is equal to 0?.

The primary objective of a cell formation algorithm in the binary version of the problem is building completely independent cells, i.e., cells in which all parts included in a part family are only processed within the corresponding machine cell. However, this is a case rarely encountered in practice. The grouped cells are usually dependent, i.e., parts have inter-cell moves. The evaluation criterion to judge the goodness of solutions is grouping efficacy. The grouping efficacy measure assesses the quality of diagonalization. The grouping efficacy measure, r , is calculated using the following formula [ 141:  e +e, -- e+ e, e+ e,  (1) r = i - L  -  where e= total number of non-zero entries in the d c matrix; e, =total number of non-zero entries outside the diagonal blocks (exceptional elements); e, =total number of zero entries inside the diagonal blocks (voids).

111. MINING ASSOCIATIONS AMONG MACHINES  Data mining techniques search through a database without a specific pre-determined hypothesis to generate implicit, previously unknown, and potentially useful  information such as knowledge rules, constraints and regularities [SI. An association function is an operation against the set of records returning relationships among the collection of items.

When arranging machine cells by considering manufacturing processes, association rule mining can be employed to discover closeness measures (support values) among machines in the manufacturing process data. The cell formation problem in d c  matrix can he adequately transformed to take a format similar to that of the aforementioned basket analysis in Boolean transaction data.

The machines processing the same family of parts could have close associations, and these machines may form a machine cell.

Since data mining creates many challenging research issues, it is necessaly to perform dedicated studies to discover new data mining methods. Apriori algorithm is a relative new approach referred to as one of the solutions for association rule learning. The mission of Apriori can he affirmed as follows [SI: find all sets of items (iferne&) that have transaction support above minimum support. The support for an itemset is the number of transactions that contain the- itemset. Itemsets with minimum support are called /urge itemsets.

In cellular manufacturing, the association rules can he used to appropriately group the machines with respect to their associations. Machines that frequently process a certain set of parts have close associations. The more associative the machines are, the closer are the machines. An efficient algorithm is required that restricts the search space and checks only a subset of all association rules, but, if possible, without missing important rules. Apriori algorithm is one such algorithm. It was developed by Agrawal et a/ [I] and is implemented in a specific way in the cell formation addressed herein. The part of a corresponding column in the incidence matrix can he taken as a transaction identifier, and the machine of the corresponding row that processes the part can he taken as items purchased together in the basket.



IV. THE CLUSTERING MODEL  Machines that frequently process a certain set of parts have close associations. The machine grouping model stems from the general formulation of clustering problems [IS].

The notations of the model are listed as follows: sy = support value (closeness measure) between machines i a n d i  1 if machine i is assigned to  the cell with  0 otherwise; machinejas the cell medium;  1, if order j i s  chosen as a 0, otherwise;  cell median;  L,,, =lower bound of machine cell size;     cl_ =upper bound of machine cell size; K= number of cells under consideration; m = number of machines; n = number of components;  The 0-1 integer model for grouping machines into cells takes the form as follows:  m m  (PI) Maximize cc.r,X, (2) Subject to: X, = 1, i= 1,2 ,..,, m, (3)  X ; , S < . ,  Z j = 1 , 2  ,._., m, (4)  *I +I m  ,+I  T q  = K ;  ( 5 ) /=I  m  qLm 5 ZX;, 5 <.U,,,, i= 1,2 ,..., m, (6) *!

zr7=0, 1, i j = 1 , 2  ,...) m, (7) r ; = O , 1 ,  j = 1 , 2  ,...) m. (8)  In the above model, the objective function (2) serves to select K machines as cell medians such that sum of association measures from all machines to their respective cell medians are maximized. The solution of this model results in the assignment of machines to cells maximizing association measures of the machines in the cells. Constraints (3) ensure that each machine belongs exactly to one machine cell. Constraints (4) and ( 5 )  are used to limit the number of machines cell as K Constraints (6)  ensures that at least Lm machines must be assigned to each machine cell, and at most U,,, machines are assigned to each machine cell. In order to avoid the formation of a singleton machine cell, Lm is usually set to 2. Constraints (7) and (8) guarantee the binary solution for machine assignment. This formulation involves (m+ m') 0-1 variables and (1 + m+ m2) constraints.

In general, we can take s.. = s.. for  4,"=1,2 ,..., m and st =loo if i = j .  Therefore, Model PI  can be modified to a compact formulation (Liu 1999), and it is formulated as follows (Model P2):  !I / I  m m  (p2) Maximize Zcs,X, (9)  Subject to: 24, =I, i= 1,2 ,..., m,  Zq.=K; (12)  r;i ,+I  (10)

V. THE CELL FORMATION PROCEDURE  In this section, a cell formation procedure based on associatidn rule mining and 0-1 integer programming is developed to identify machine groups and part families simultaneously with minimum manual judgment. The algorithm steps for cell formation are presented as follows.

Step 1 : Organize machine-component data (a). Read d c  matrix A,, .

(b). Take the part of the corresponding column in mic matrix  as a record identifier, and the machine of the corresponding row as an item.

Step 2: Proceed Apriori algorithm for obtaining association values among machines (a). Discover the set of large 2-itemsets, L, .

(b). Generate support s# and confidence cr for each  element in L, , i.e. each pair of Machines i a n d j  ( Mj and M,.), i, j= 1, 2;", m  (c). Compute the minimum support sm," as the average  value of s+, and the minimum confidence c,, as the  average value of e,  of minimum support and minimum confidence.

(d). Obtain the association rule set R by using the property  Step 3: Solve the clustering model for grouping machine cells (a). Set K= lm/S].

(h). Solve the clustering model with K machine cells,  F ,= l ,2  ,..., K .

Step 4. Group part families (a). Maintain the machine cells obtained from Step 3.

(h). For each column (part), calculate the number of  operations on each machine cell 3: w' = Eo,.

(c). For each part, assign it to Cell k (F,) with the highest  value of wi. If any tie exists, it is broken in a random manner.

VM,=F,  Step 5 .  Calculate the grouping efficacy (a). Calculate the grouping efficacy of cell formation with     K machine cells and part families by using equation (I), and maintain the configuration with the highest grouping efficacy.

(b). If K <  [+I, set K= K+ 1 and return to Step 3 .

Otherwise, proceed to Step 6 .

Step 6. Terminate Retum the cell formation with K machine cells  The task-relevant data in the cell formation problem is the 0-1 incidence matrix ( d c  matrix). It is input to the proposed algorithm in Step 1. The ndc matrix is the set of process cards. Each column in the mic matrix represents a record in the association mining by Apriori algorithm. Each element in the row is a binary variable representing that a machine (item) is present.

In Step 2, the affinities of each pair of machines are calculated, so that only large 2-itemsets, L, , are generated.

In cell formation, an association rule is an implication of the form N.=+M, [support = A??, confidence = P?].

Provided that support and confidence are higher than the minimum support and the minimum confidence, it implies that parts are frequently processed on Machine N., and also on Machine 4.. Therefore, these two machines are potentially required to he placed in the same machine cell.

The minimum support and the minimum confidence are calculated as the average values of support and confidence.

Step 3 groups the machine cells by solving the association based clustering model so as to maximize the support values among the machines in a cell. The number of clusters is assigned between [Lm/5], [ d i l l .  After the machine cells have been grouped, this algorithm proceeds to Step 4 to build part families. A part is assigned to a machine cell provided that most of the operations of this part are processed on this cell. In Step 5, the grouping efficacy is adopted to evaluate the performance of the diagonal block of d c  matrix. The algorithm terminates in Step 6,  and outputs the cell formation with the highest grouping efficacy.

and part families with the highest grouping efficacy.



VI. NUMERICAL EXAMPLES  The approach has been implemented using the ILOG OPL 3.0 on an IBM compatible PC with a Pentium 4 processor. These three problems, referred to as Examples 1-3 [2, 6, 71, include different instances of the cell formation problem in terms of size and difficulty. In addition, results obtained from the existing methods are available in the cell formation literature.

The grouping efficacy (refer to equation (I))  is used as the evaluation criterion to test the proposed cell formation algorithm. The grouping efficacy has been frequently used in the literature and results of these three examples are available for comparison. Table I summarizes the computational results  for the three data sets. Observing the results obtained by the proposed approach, they compare favorably with ZODIAC 171, GRAFICS [23], MST 1191, MST-GRAFICS [24] and GA-TSP [9]. However, the proposed approach may not generate better solutions than GP-SLCA (Dimopoulos and Mort 2001) in terms of grouping efficacy.

GP-SLCA and MST allow the existence of singleton clusters (machine cells involving only a single machine).

Since singleton clusters can result in a higher grouping efficacy value, GP-SLCA and MST generally have a higher degree of grouping efficacy in comparison with other algorithms. This occurs because grouping efficacy places more emphasis on minimizing voids in the cells than on preventing exceptional elements. In the real world cellular manufacturing systems, singleton clusters are only allowed in some particular situations. Therefore, GP-SLCA and MST may configure an impractical cellular layout. Another main limitation of GP-SLCA [I l l  is its high degree of computational complexity in relation to alternative cell formation algorithms since GP-SLCA is based on genetic programming. The information ahout the CPU time of GP-SLCA was not given in Dimopoulos and Mort [ I l l .

However, the GP-based approach usually necessitates a vast amount of computational requirement to sufficiently converge to a solution. The CPU time required for the proposed algorithm ranges from 2.0 seconds for the smallest problem to 16.0 seconds for the largest problem on an IBM compatible PC with a Pentium 4 processor. From the computational results, the proposed approach shows its ability to find quality solutions for the cell formation problems.

VII. CONCLUSION  In this paper, an association clustering approach to cell formation problems by using association rule mining and 0-1 integer programming is developed to find the effective configurations for cellular manufacturing systems. By applying association rules to cell formation problems, certain sets of machines (machine groups) that frequently process some parts together can be inducted. A data mining technique referred to as association rule induction is utilized herein to find the association rules among machines from the process database. Machine cells are grouped by solving the     association based clustering model so as to maximize the [I41 C.S. Kumar and M.P. Chandrasekharan, ?Grouping support values among the machines in a cell.
