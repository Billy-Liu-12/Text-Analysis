I.  INTRODUCTION With the in-depth development of information  technology in colleges and universities, more and more colleges and universities to enable the research management system, and accumulated a large amount of data in the application. Southwest Petroleum University was officially opened in 2011, Southwest Petroleum University research management system, the same year Economics and Management of independent research and research management system of the School of Economics and Management and put into trial operation. The main functions of the system is the foundation for scientific research data management (add, modify, delete), use of the system data is more limited, data query and statistical reports to the relevant functional departments, leading. Data mining and effective use of long-term accumulation of large amounts of data can not effectively support the research management and decision-making. This paper introduces the data mining concept on the basis of the research association rule mining in university research management system, in order to optimize and improve the existing research management systems.

II. RELATED CONCEPTS OF DATA MINING Data mining is a large number of incomplete, noisy,  fuzzy and random data; extract the invisible, pre unknown, the potential value of information and knowledge for decision-making process. Through data mining can be found hidden in a lot of data behind the information and knowledge, and generate decision support information, support, or helping to lead decision-making.

A. Basic concepts of association rules 1) Association rules: from data mining to meet certain  conditions dependent relationship is of the form ?X ? Y, support = s%, confidence = c% "rule. The main target of the association rule mining is transaction data.

2)  Confidence: the set D of all affairs in support for transaction sets X, if c% of the transaction also supports the transaction sets Y, then c% is called the confidence of the association rule X ? Y. The confidence levels the strength of the rule, expressed confidence (X ? Y).

3)  Support: in the entire transaction set D, if s% of transactions to support both transaction sets X and Y, then s% is called the support of the association rule X ? Y.

Support levels the frequency of the rules ,  expressed support (X). Among them, the minimum support is expressed by the Minimum Support (minsup).

4)  Frequent Itemsets: the support of the transaction sets X support (X) is not less than the minimum support minsup, claimed that X is a frequent itemset. Support and confidence are greater than a given threshold rules are called strong rules. Data Mining is the mining strong rules.

Usually associated rules can be described using the following mathematical model: I = {i1, i2, ..., in} for the data itemset, D is the whole transaction set, each transaction T has a unique identity for TID. On the data itemsets X ? I, Y ? I, that X contains Y, if and only when X ? Y. Association rules in the form: (X ? Y, support (X ? Y) = s%, confidence (X ? Y) = c%). Here X ? I, Y ? I, and X?Y= ? , X-called conditions of the rule, known as Y-the result of the rule.

Association rule mining consists of two phases: (1) to find all frequent itemsets from the transaction database; (2) to generate association rules by the frequent itemsets.

B. Apriori algorithm The basic idea of Apriori algorithm is to find frequent  itemsets based on the candidate itemsets, and the frequent itemsets support is not less than the predefined minimum support. Apriori algorithm first calculate 1 - itemsets C1, ie, candidate 1 - itemset (k-itemset is of containing k-item set) to identify all the frequent 1 - itemsets L1, then according to the frequent 1 - itemsets to determine the candidate 2 - itemsets to identify frequent 2 - itemsets L2, from candidate 2 - itemsets, turn down, until no longer designate the set of options.

The specific algorithm is described as follows: Input: DB, minsup   DOI 10.1109/ICCIS.2012.81     Output: result = { All frequent itemsets and their support}  Result: = {}; k: = 1; C1: = 1 - itemsets While(Ck ? ? ) do  begin Generate a counter to the set of items in each Ck  Counterk[i]: = 0; /* "i" denotes the i-th k-itemsets */ for(i = 1; i ? |DB|; i++) /* | DB |  denotes the total number of records in the database */ begin  if i-th record (TID i) supports the jth k- itemsets in Ck  then Counterk[j] = Counterk[j] + 1; end  Lk: = { all itemsets in Ck to meet the greater than minsup support }  Frequent itemsets in Lk support reservations result: = result Lk; Ck+1: = {all the (k+1)-itemsets focused on meeting  its subset of the set of all the items in Lk} k = k+1;  enddo

III. USE APPLICATION OF ASSOCIATION RULES MINING IN UNIVERSITY RESEARCH MANAGEMENT  Now the paper of the Southwest Petroleum University of Economics and Management 64 teachers from 2007 to 2011 data, for example, data mining using the Apriori algorithm for association rules on teachers 'job title, publication level of the teachers' highest level of education and teachers published three properties. Table I on the basis of the raw data of the finishing system, contains a total of 301 records.

Length of the relationship part of the School of Economics and Management Research Management System database table structure changes, such as papers in the original table name, publication name, teacher's name is omitted, respectively, using the paper number, the publication level, teacher numbers indicate, the remaining attributes column were not listed. Easy to understand, no candidate itemsets and frequent itemsets converted to a boolean expression.

TABLE VII.  FREQUENT 3 - ITEMSETS L3  Itemset Support {professor, Ph.D, EI included } 16%  Frequent 3 - itemset L3 can no longer draw the candidate 4 - itemset C4, when minsup = 16%, To use Apriori algorithm can be frequent itemsets: {Professor, Ph.D., EI included}. The second Mining step from this frequent itemset, can be six association rules to calculate their degree of confidence, respectively:  Conf (professor ?Ph.D., EI included) = 36.4%, Conf (Ph.D. ? Professor, EI included) = 46.2%  Conf (EI included? Professor, Ph.D.) = 42.9%, Conf (professor, Ph.D. ?EI included) = 66.7%  Conf (professors, EI included ?Ph.D.) = 70.6%, Conf (Ph.D., EI included ? Professor) = 66.7  Set minconf = 70%, you can get the association rules (Professor, EI included ? Dr. , support = 16%, confidence = 70%), the association rules of data on: the number of teachers whose title is professor, the highest level of education is Ph.D. and paper level is EI included, is 16% of the total number of teachers; and this number is 70% of the  total number of teachers whose title is professor and paper level is EI included,  Through the association rules, we find that: 1) titles of the higher, the higher the degree, the paper the higher the level; 2) teachers published in the level of their academic qualifications and titles of a great relationship, and the title is also affected by the level of qualifications and papers impact.

And then helping to lead to make decisions: such as the introduction of highly educated people, or sent out to existing school (hospital) staff for further training, or encourage teachers to take the initiative to pursue further studies, published papers of high quality, so as to enhance scientific research quality and level.

In fact, research policy makers can be adjusted according to the needs of research and development of frequent itemsets the support and confidence of the two parameters to find the association rules to discover laws, in order to better promote the school (School) research and development to determine the need to support or focus on the development of the research groups of a disciplinary judgment basis.

Through this example, we can find association rules data mining method can be excavated from the large amounts of data correlation between the data can not be found on the surface to effectively support the leadership decision- making.



IV. CONCLUSION Compared with the existing university research  management system, a simple data management, query and statistical functions, related concept of data mining based on association rule mining application to university research management system for research management functions and its leadership decision-making to provide effective support.

Next step will be the basis of this study, to expand the scope of data mining, research the different data mining methods to extend the data mining and decision support function modules on the basis of the current research management system, promotion of scientific research management system to research decision-making support system transition to further enhance the efficiency of research management and decision-making more scientific and intelligent level.
