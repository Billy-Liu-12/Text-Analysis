RESEARCH ON THE METHOD OF RADAR-TO-ESM TRACK  CORRELATION

Abstract This paper proposes a new method to realize the track correlation of Radar and ESM. Firstly, the coarse correlation rule is set up via the first-order Taylor series expansion and a coarse association function based on the geometry of radar and ESM. Then, the fine correlation matrix is set up by accumulating the historical information of the coarse correlation matrix. It is found that the coarse correlation threshold is only related with ESM measurement error.

Finally, the simulation results show that the new proposed algorithm can effectively improve the correlation performance.

Keywords: ESM; track correlation; correlation rule; Taylor series expansion  1 Introduction Radar and Electronic support measures (ESM) are two important sensor types in military integration system[1][2].

Radar is an active sensor which measures the range and angle of the source, while ESM is a passive sensor which measures the azimuth angles of the source and provides identification and waveform information. The outputs of an ESM sensor contain the target attributes as well as their bearings. For example, introducing target kinematics into ESM analysis helps to enhance the performance of classification and identification. Similarly, utilizing target attribute information in radar tracking can improve the track continuity and tracking of maneuvering targets. It is known that ESM sensors have a range advantage over most radars because the received signal by the ESM sensor only travels one way while the radar signals have to travel two ways[3]. It is benefit to fuse the information provided by radar and ESM. Moreover, bringing the target kinematics into ESM analysis helps to improve the performance of classification and identification of ESM. In general, Radar-ESM sensor fusion can increase the detection probability of a target, improve situation awareness and provide more accurate and complete composite target track files.

It is a critical issue of Radar-ESM data fusion to associate the radar tracks with the ESM tracks. Thomas firstly considered  the problem of Radar-ESM track association in literature [4].

Trunk and Wilson continued to do some research on this subject in [5]-[6], the approach which Trunk and Wilson proposed was based on the assumption that the cumulative probability of the random is variable with a chi-squared density. Smith and Wang have done deeper research on the algorithm of the Trunk-Wilson algorithm in [7]-[8]. However, these algorithms still can not avoid the difficulties that are encountered by the Trunk-Wilson algorithm.

Another algorithm of radar-ESM track association utilizes the bearing-only track techniques for the ESM azimuth measurements[8][9][10]. These algorithms are track dependent, i.e., their performances rely on appropriate targets? dynamic models. Zhou proposed a neural network based approach for ESM/Radar Track in [11], so a new model of three dimension neural network is proposed to deal with the problem of three dimension assignment[12][13]. The method needed to know the posterior probability, which is not an adaptive algorithm. A Gray Correlation Degree of B-mode algorithm was proposed by [14]-[15]. But the algorithm requires different threshold with the simulation scene changed[16].

This paper presents a novel algorithm for Radar-ESM track association. This algorithm uses the geometrical property of radar, ESM and target to establish association function and deduces the association function which is a zero-mean Gauss distribution function[17]. Assuming the ESM measurement error obeys zero-mean Gaussian distribution[18]. The coarse correlation rule is built by association function obeying Gaussian distribution. Based on the rough correlation, association cost matrix is established based on the historical information and determined the track association pairs according to the smallest cost principle. The fine correlation is carried out with the accumulation of tracks? historical information. Computer simulations are used to demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

The paper is organized as follows. In section 2 the system model of radar-ESM correlation are discussed. Section 3 describes the new radar-ESM correlation method. The simulation results and the conclusions are given in section 4 and 5, respectively.

2 Problem formulation    Assume radar and ESM sensors are located in different locations. Without loss of generality, assume that radar A is located at the origin of the common Cartesian coordinate system as shown in Fig. 1. In order to simplify the analysis, some notations and assumptions are made. is the radar range measurement,  AR  A is the radar azimuth measurement,  B is the ESM azimuth measurement, D is the distance between radar and ESM, _A B is the azimuth of Radar observation ESM, _B A is the azimuth of ESM observation Radar, _a A B A is the angle of Radar observation target and ESM, and _b B B A is the angle of ESM observation target and Radar.

Figure 1: Geometry of Radar and ESM sensors   According to the triangular geometry properties, there is   sin( ) sin( )  at  b a  r D  b  (1)  Equation (1) can be rewritten as  sin( ) in( )b at a bD r s (2)  It is assumed the radar provides a set of sensor tracks at time , , which can be modeled by k 1, 1, ,iT i N  , ,  , ,  ( ) ( ) ( ) , 1, ,  ( ) ( ) ( ) ae i at i ra  ae i at i a  r k r k k i N  k k k (3)  Where, and, ( )ae ir k , ( )ae i k are the estimated range and azimuth of the target respectively,  and, ( )at ir k , ( )at i k are the real target range and azimuth from radar respectively ( )ra k  and  ( )a k are the estimation error.

It is assumed that the ESM provides a set of sensor tracks at time k , 2, 1, ,jT j N , which can be modeled by  , ,( ) ( ) ( ), 1, ,bm j bt j bk k k j 2N (4)  where , ( )bm j k is the target azimuth measurement from ESM,  , ( )bt j k is the true target azimuth from ESM, and measurement error ( )b k is modeled by a zero-mean Gaussian random vector with covariance 2b .

3 The correlation rule  3.1 Coarse Association Process  Generally, the number of tracks obtained from radar and ESM are different, i.e., 1N N2 . Assume tracks are time aligned.

The equation (2) holds only when the tracks obtained from radar and ESM have no noises. However, the noises are always unavoidable. In this situation, in order to discribe quantitively the influences of noises on (2), we establish the association function ( )ijf k  which denotes the difference between both sides of (2), the difference is expected to be as small as possible.

Substitute (3) and (4) into (5) to yield  , _  ,  _ ,  , _  ( ) sin( ( ) ( ) )  ( ( ) ( )) in( ( ( ) ( ))  ( ( ) ( ) ))  ij bt j b B A  at i ra  A B at i a  bt j b B A  f k D k k r k k s  k k  k k  (6)  The association function ( )ijf k can be expanded using the first-order Taylor series expansion at estimation errors and measurement error to be zeros as  ' ' '( , )( ) ( , ) ( )ijij ij  f k f k f k (7)  where , , [ ]Tra a b ' [0 0 0]T    ' '  , _  _ ,  , _  , _ ,  , _  ( , ) ( ) cos( ( ) ) ( )  in( ( ( ))  ( ( ) )) ( )  ( )) cos( ( ( ))  ( ( ) ))( ( ) ( ))  ij bt j B A b  A B at i  bt j B A ra  at i A B at i  bt j B A a b  f k D k k  s k  k k  r k k  k k k  , )  (8)  (9)  ' , _  , _  , _  ( , ) sin( ( ) )  ( ( )) in( ( ( )  ( ( ) ))  ij bt j B A  at i A B at i  bt j B A  f k D k  r k s k  k  Suppose the two tracks are from the same target, according to (2), the equation(10) can be obtained  '( , ) 0ijf k  (10)  Thus, (7) takes the simplified form  , _  _ ,  , _  , _ ,  , _  ( ) cos( ( ) ) ( )  in( ( ( ))  ( ( ) )) ( )  ( ) cos( ( ( ))  ( ( ) ))( ( ) ( ))  ij bt j B A b  A B at i  bt j B A ra  at i A B at i  bt j B A a b  f k D k k  s k  k k  r k k  k k k  (11)  In the actual system, since the estimated results is convergent, the difference between the true state of the target and the estimated state is tiny, which can be ignored. Namely the estimation error ( ) 0ra k , ( ) 0a k , so (11) can be simplified as  , _  , _  , _  ( ) ( cos( ( ) )  ( ) cos( ( ( ))  ( ( ) ))) ( )  ij bt j B A  at i A B at i  bt j B A b  f k D k  r k k  k k ,  (12)  From (12), the association function ( )ijf k is only related to the ESM accuracy in measurement and ( )ijf k should be zeros without the measurement error of ESM. Thus the covariance of ( )ijf k  is  , _  , _  2 2 , _  ( cos( ( ) )  ( ) cos( ( ( ))  ( ( ) )))  f bt j B A  at i A B at i  bt j B A b  D k r k k  k ,  (13)  According to the property of zero-mean Gaussian, we can obtain  ( ) 3 0.997ij fP f k (14)  It denotes when the value of the function ( )ijf k exceeds the range, the probability that the two tracks of radar and ESM does not originate from the same target is greater than 99.7%.

The coarse association rule is constructed according to(14).

When the value of ( )ijf k according to (15) is obtained for the thi track of radar and the of ESM, where thj  11,2,i n , 21, 2, ,j n  ,  ( ) sin( ( ))  ( ) in( ( ) ( )) ij bj  ae i ai bj  f k D k  r k s k k (15)  The value of  coarse correlation threshold of the thi track of radar and the thj of ESM is given by  3 f (16)  If ( )ijf k  meets the condition  ( )ijf k (17)  the coarse association of the two tracks is successful.

In this situation, the corresponding element remains the original value in the association matrix ( )M NF k . If the value of ( )ijf k doesn?t satisfy the rule, the value in the corresponding position is set  ( )ijf k (18)  Coarse association matrix ( ) [ ( )],M N ijF k f k 1,..., ,i M 1,...,j N  is defined at time .  k  3.2 Fine Association Process  Based on the coarse association matrix ( )M NF k obtained by the coarse association process, the fine association process is given in this subsection.

Define the matrix M NG to record the sum of the matrix ( )M NF k  from time l to time , and l n 2 pC records the track pairs that correlate successfully, i.e. where, p  denotes the number of successful correlation pairs.

One cycle of the recursive process is given as follows.

Step 1 According to (19), summate the matrix from time l to time ,we can obtain that l n  0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 x 10             Radar  x 10  ESM    ( ) l n  M N M N k l  G F k (19)  Where means to obtain the absolute value of each element in the matrix.

Also initializing the number of successful correlation pairs . 0p  Step 2 Search for the minimum value of  , 1,..., ;ijg i M 1,...,j N in the matrix M NG , where ijg denotes the element  in the i  row and  column.  th j th  Step 3 Correlation judgement  If , it denotes that track and trackijg i j share the same target, then . Set 1p p  (:, ) [ ]TC p i j (20)  ( ,:)G i  and G j ; (:, ) if g ,  go to step 4.

Step 4 return to step 2 to continue the recursive process until the elements in the coarse association matrix all are set as infinite values. The fine association matrixC is obtained now.

4) The correlation performance is improved with the distance of radar and ESM getting larger.

5 Conclusion This paper provides a new Radar-ESM tracks association method which builds up association function based on the geometry of radar, ESM and target?s positions. Firstly, a association function is built up. Then, correlating the association function by the correlation rule, and accumulates the results of coarse correlation historical information to fine correlation. It is proven that the correlation probability can be improved with the n getting larger, the ESM measurement error getting smaller or the distance of radar and ESM getting larger. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in associate the Radar track to ESM track.
