THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF ONTOLOGY AND RULES BASED KNOWLEDGE  BASE FOR TRANSPORTATION

Abstract?The traditional transportation information inquiry mainly uses key words based on texts, and the service the inquiry system provided is onefold and only aims at one transporting means. In addition, the inquiry system lacks the comprehensive transportation inquiry combining water, land and air traffic information; also it lacks semantic level inquiry, bringing users lots of inconvenience. In view of the above questions, we proposed establishing a knowledge base of transportation information based on the OWL ontologies and SWRL rules, which can express the rich semantic knowledge of three dimension transporting means (water, land and air) in formalization. Using the ontologies through kinds, properties, instances and classifications ontologies can express structure knowledge, support knowledge automatic sorting and the instance recognition, so as to provide formal semantics for the description of many concepts involved in the transportation domain and relations between these concepts. Using the SWRL rules can solve problem of insufficient expressivity of ontologies in properties association and operation to provide support for spatial relationships reasoning.  In order to make use of these knowledge effectively, we have designed a reasoning system based on the ontologies and rules with the help of Prot?g? and its plug-ins. The system can eliminate ambiguity of the concepts and discover hidden information by reasoning, realizing knowledge and semantic level transportation information inquiry.

I. INTRODUCTION GIS is moving towards the ordinary populace from the  profession application, however how to let the non- specialized users to use them effectively is still in need of further research [1]. At present, the effective use of the GIS technologies relies on project training or the specialized knowledge which gains from the practice; however this kind of training and practice needs to spend much time and energy, which has hindered the GIS popularization. The effective way to solve this question is to construct systems which have the full domain knowledge and logical reasoning ability to surmount knowledge gap between the non-GIS users and experts. In this article, we use both ontologies and rules to establish knowledge base in the transportation domain, which may have all kinds of entity and the relations in transportation domain formally expressed in the semantic knowledge which machines can recognize and share, and we have designed the knowledge reasoning system based on this, for the non-expert user to fill specialized knowledge vacancy, which avoids the ambiguity of concepts in inquiries based on texts, realizing intellectualized reasoning and the inquiry in the knowledge and the semantic level.



II. KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION IN TRANSPORTATION DOMAINS  Generally speaking, the so-called knowledge representation is a group of agreements on the description of the world and the symbolization or formalization of the knowledge [2].Knowledge representation methods used at present are mainly: predicate logics, production rules, frameworks, semantic network, object-oriented method, ontology and so on.

These methods respectively have their advantages and disadvantages, this article use the method which combines ontologies and rules to describe the transportation knowledge.

The ontologies which are taken as the explicit conceptual standard, can be shared, and is commonly used to describe the acknowledged structured knowledge. But at present it is yet imperfect, with problems like insufficient expressivity and reasoning capabilities. The rule is different from the ontology, which stresses statement knowledge deduction. The participation of rules can make up for the insufficient expressivity of ontologies, and enhance the operating efficiency of the practical application.

A. Ontologies constructing The main purpose of constructing ontologies is to capture  the knowledge for transportations, e.g., all kinds of transporting modes in  water, land and air, correlated administrative area, landmarks, meteorological information knowledge and so on.

Each kind of entities and their relations possibly involved when one travels have been represented by formal language, provides in semantic and knowledge level structured description for this domain, enables the machine to read them and reasoning base on them, lays foundations for the establishment of the rules.

1) ontologies compositions: We use five elements to express ontologies in this domain:  T-Ontology= (TC, TP, TI, TR and TA).

TC is a series of concepts set. The concept refers to a gather of entity or phenomenon which has the same attribute in the domain. In this article the concepts mainly involves the routes like the track for flight, train and the public transportation vehicle; stops like highway exportation, airport, train station, public transportation stop, motor station and so on; road like highway, administrative division like Wuhan, Hongshan area and so on; landmarks like Wuhan University, Guangbutun and so on; time concept like year, month, date, hour, minute and so on; meteorological concept like thick fog, storm, typhoon and so on; transportation situation like accident, traffic jam and so on.

TP is a attribute set related to concepts. The properties are used to describe some facet of the concept or entity, like the   DOI 10.1109/CSSE.2008.1405     price for airplane ticket, time for taking off, average speed of the train and so on.

TI is the instances set that are instantiations for the concepts from TC. The instances are equivalents in the concept space for entities in the real world, , like west Beijing station, Wuchang train station, Hongqiao Airport, the city of Wuhan, 106 national road for Beijing to Guangzhou and so on.

TABLE I.  THE SPATIAL RELATIONS IMPLEMENTED IN OUR WORK  Point-Point Point-Line Surface-Surface   Overlap   Adjacent   Far away  On   Adjacent, Far away     Contain?ed?     Adjacent     Far away  Line-Line Line-Surface Point-Surface   Connect  Cross not Connect   Not Cross     Connect     Cross not  Connect   Far away     Contained     Adjacent     Far away  TR is relation sets including the basic semantic relations and the spatial relations. We divide them into two kinds:  a) Basic semantic relations. Relations represent a type of interaction between concepts of the domain. There are four basic relations: part-of, kind-of, instance-of, and attribute-of.

Part-of represents the relations between parts and the whole.

Kind-of represents the Succession relations among concepts for example, the railway station is a subclass of the Station.

Instance-of represents the relations between instances and their concepts just like the relations between objects and their classes in the OOD.  Attribute-of refers to the relation of some instance taken as property of others, just like Guangbutun stop is an anchor point for the 519 bus route.

b) Spatial relations.  According to the spatial entities? geometric characteristics and the need for knowledge expression, we category them into three kinds of concepts: point, line and surface. We will analyze the point-line, point- surface, line-surface, point-point, surface-surface, and line-line relations (as table 1 shows). Spatial relations between point and line include: On (), Adjacent (), Off(), respectively presuming that the point is on the line, that the point is in the buffer-area of the line within a certain threshold, and that the point is far away from the line. Spatial relations between the point and the surface mainly include: Contained (), Adjacent (), Off(), respectively presuming that the point is in the surface, that the point is in the buffer-area of the surface within a certain threshold, and that the point is far away from the surface. The line and the surface relations are classified into three kinds, Cross () presumes that the line has the stops in or access to the surface, Off () presumes that the line and the surface do not have intersections physically, while Cross_Off() presumes that the two intersected physically but are not able to reach, for instance some highway passes through some province but there is neither entrance nor exit there, then we thought this line cannot directly arrive at this region. The spatial relations between points include: Overlap (), Adjacent (), Off (), respectively presuming that the two overlap, that one is in the buffer-area of the other within some threshold and that the two are far away from each other. The surface and the surface spatial relations include four kinds, Contained () refers to the former is located in the latter, Contain () are contrary relation to Contained (), Adjacent () refers to the two has the common surface territory or the nearest distance in a certain threshold, Off () refers to the two are far away from each other or the nearest distance between the two outside the certain threshold. Spatial Relations between lines include three kinds of situations, Cross () refers to the two intersecting and connecting, Off () refers to the two not having a common point of intersection, Cross_Off () refers to the situation which the two intersect but don?t connect (e.g., the road are cross, but there are no turns from one to the other ?. Although some relations (e.g., Adjacent (), Off(),) may express relations between many kinds of instances, but there will be a difference in the semantic information among different kinds of objects. In the above relations the threshold value can be presumed dynamically according to context of the spatial scale. OWL is capable of describing the above relations, but the spatial relations reasoning merely depending upon ontology description language is unable to complete; therefore they must be described and reasoned with the help of the rules to remedy the flaws of description logic?s insufficient expressivity.

TA is the axiom collection, used for restraining attributes and the relations. The axioms are usually logic expression.

They are used to model sentences that are always true, for instance the Hongqiao Airport will belong to the concept "the airport". We may use the axiom to constrain the information, to testify correctness and infer new information. Joining the axiom in the ontology means it may express richer relations among concept.

2) Ontology representation ? We adopt OWL as the ontology description language,which is recommended by W3C ontology description language for ontology in the Semantic Web[3], it takes RDF and RDF-S as the foundation, further strengthened expression and the reasoning ability for domain knowledge. Through the Boolean operator (conjunction, disjunction, negation), OWL may recursively construct the complex kind, the language elements have also considered the existential restrictions, value restrictions and number restriction, functional restrictions and so on. At the same time, OWL can describe the attribute?s characteristics such as transmission, the symmetry, the function and so on, stating equivalence or disjointness between concepts, attributes and individuals. We take Prot?g?-OWL as the ontology editor that is an extension of Prot?g?  supporting the Web Ontology Language (OWL) [4]. It enables users to load and save OWL and RDF ontologies, edit and visualize classes, properties, and SWRL rules, define logical class characteristics as OWL expressions, execute reasoners such as description logic classifiers, edit OWL individuals for semantic web markup.

Excerpt below described the Wuchang railway station and Zhongshan Road's geometry shape as well as neighboring relations between them (Figure1):  <owl:Class rdf:ID=" GeoDescription "/> <owl:Class rdf:about="#Point"><!?Point --> <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#GeoDescription"/> </owl:Class> <owl:Class rdf:ID="Polyline"><!--Polyline--> <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#GeoDescription"/> </owl:Class> <owl:Class rdf:ID="Station"><!--Station--> <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#Point"/> </owl:Class> <owl:Class rdf:ID="Road"><!--Road--> <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#Polyline"/> </owl:Class> <owl:SymmetricProperty rdf:ID="Adjacent-To"> <rdfs:range rdf:resource="#GeoDescription"/> <rdf:type rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#ObjectPropert y"/> <owl:inverseOf rdf:resource="#Adjacent-To"/> <rdfs:domain rdf:resource="#GeoDescription"/> </owl:SymmetricProperty> <Station rdf:ID="WuChang_Station"> <Adjacent-To> <Street rdf:ID="ZhongShan_Road"/> </Adjacent-To> </Station>  Figure 1.  Except of spatial relations description  B. Rules? Construction Although ontology is organized through semantic means  such as vertical classification, transverse attributes and relations and so on, it is far from enough by OWL for attributes operation such as rules of relations among attributes. While spatial relations reasoning is involved in the operation of space attributes [5].

SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language) [6] based on a combination of the OWL DL and OWL Lite with the Unary/Binary Datalog RuleML sublanguages of the Rule Markup Language is developed in order to make up for the OWL language that is imperfect in the ability of expression.

SWRL described the knowledge of OWL ontology by highly abstract syntax expression, which realized the combination between the horn-like rules and OWL knowledge base. We take SWRL to express formally spatial reasoning rules. A few simple examples as follows:  Route(?x) ? Stop(?y) ? Admin_District(?z) ? Belong- To(?y,?x)?In(?y,?z)?Cross(?x,?z)  Notes: If a certain route has a stop within the scope of the administrative regions, the route passes through the administrative region.

Route(?x)?Stop(?y)?LandMark(?z)?Belong-To(?y,?x) ?Adjacent_To(?y,?z)?Adjacent_To(?z,?x)?  Notes: If a landmark has a closer distance to a stop of some route, it may be considered that the route can reach the landmark through the stop.

Route(?x)?Route (?y)?Stop(?z)?Belong-To(?z,?x)? Belong-To(?z,?y)?Transfer(?x,?y)  Notes: If a stop belongs to two lines at the same time, we can transfer through the stop.

Route(?x) ? Admin_District(?y) ? Admin_District(?z) ? Cross(?x,?z)?Cross(?x,?z)?Direct(?y,?z)  Notes: If a certain route has a cross relationship respectively with the two administrative regions, the two regions can be reached directly through the line.

Admin_District(?x)?Thick_Fog(?y)?Highway_Gate(?z) ?In(?z,?x)?Has_Weather(?x,?y) ?Disable(?z)  Notes: If there is heavy fog weather in some administrative region, highway entrances and exits there need to be closed.

Through spatial relations and the formal rules of expression, we can realize the computer-readable and automatic processing of spatial relationships.



III. INFERENCE SYSTEM BASED ON THE OWL AND SWRL SWRL and OWL take advantages of both them: on the one  hand, the rules are good at pluralistic relations with deductive knowledge, and ontology focus on the description of the unary concept; on the other hand, the rules do not support the concept of existence, while ontology provide complex definition of the concept, including concepts such as existence and so on [7].

The inference task for ontologies and rules based knowledge base mainly divided into two parts: ontology-based reasoning and rule-based reasoning.

A. Ontology-Based Inference We can use Racer [8] to complete the ontology consistency,  concept based classification and other ontology-based Inference tasks. Racer is a kind of inference engine based on     Description Logic. It uses SHIQ [9] as its description logic basis, so racer can be used in the inference behavior of OWL DL which is based on this logic. In this system it is mainly used for the following tasks:  Firstly, it is used to test the consistency in the ontology. If there are inconsistencies in the ontology, as a modeling and semantic description tool, it will produce formal and semantic contradictions, making ambiguity in specific work.

Second it is used to test the subsumption relation. Concepts can be classified into different levels through the test.

Third, the instance detection can determine the corresponding concept description for certain individuals, and then classify individuals belonging to some concept.

Fourth, some auxiliary inference functions are important tools for specific applications, such as retrieval of the concept names and individual names in the knowledge base, the retrieval of individual pairs related to their roles and the retrieval of role-level search which means the role of parent and child level.

B. rule-based reasoning With respect to rule-based reasoning, we make use of Jess  (Java Expert System Shell) to complete. The rule based inference framework is shown in figure 2.  The tool use lisp- like syntax to describe the rules and facts, and can through rules inference facts. We make format conversions from knowledge base based on both ontologies and rules to Jess with help of SWRLTab plug-in. The SWRLTab has four main software components:(1) a graphical editor; (2) a Java API for working with SWRL rules; (3) a rule engine bridge that interoperates with rule engines to execute SWRL rules; and (4) a built-in bridge for defining and executing implementations of SWRL built-ins.

The SWRL Rule Engine Bridge is a subcomponent of the SWRLTab that provides a bridge between an OWL model with SWRL rules and a rule engine. Its goal is to provide the infrastructure necessary to incorporate rule engines into Prot?g?-OWL to execute SWRL rules. The bridge provides mechanisms to (1) import SWRL rules and relevant OWL classes, individuals, properties and restrictions from an OWL model; (2) write that knowledge to a rule engine; (3) allow the rule engine to perform inference and to assert its new knowledge back to the bridge; and (4) insert that asserted knowledge into an OWL model. The bridge also provides mechanisms to dynamically add graphical user interfaces to the SWRLTab to allow interaction between a particular rule engine implementation and a user.

A bridge for the Jess rule engine called the SWRLJessTab is provided in the Prot?g?-OWL distribution.  Through this component SWRL Jess Bridge, we can have OWL / SWRL automatically converted into Jess Rule and implemented, which will avoid a tedious work of manual conversion from SWRL rules to Jess Rule rules. We can reason on various SWRL rules by using Jess inference engine, get kinds of hidden knowledge.

IV. CONCLUSIONS Through the methods ontologies and rules, this article  established the transportation information knowledge base, and constructed a homogeneous reasoning system based both on semantic and spatial relations inference. The reasoning system divides tasks of reasoning into two parts (based on the ontologies and the rules) respectively handled by the ontologies reasoning engine and the rules engine. In brief, the knowledge base and the establishment of reasoning system will fill up the knowledge gap between the non-expert users and the GIS experts, and provide the more convenient inquiry way for the users. The prototype system is at the experimental stage now, the integrated knowledge base also needs expert's carefully looking through to achieve better performance.
