Performance Limits for Monopulse Matched Filter Samples.

Abstract?Via jointly processing multiple (sum, azimuth- and elevation-difference) monopulse matched filter samples it is possible to extract and localize several (more than two) tar- gets spaced more closely than the classical interpretation of radar resolution. This paper derives the Crame?r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for sampled monopulse radar data.
