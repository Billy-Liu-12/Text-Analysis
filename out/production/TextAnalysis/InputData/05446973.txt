Abstract?. 12The German Aerospace Center DLR ? namely the Applied Remote Sensing Cluster CAF and the German Space Operations Center GSOC ? is responsible for the establishment of the ground segment of the future German hyperspectral satellite mission EnMAP (Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program). The Applied Remote Sensing Cluster has long lasting experiences with air- and spaceborne acquisition, processing, and analysis of hyperspectral image data. This paper mainly addresses the concept of the operational and automatic processing chain and the calibration / data quality to generate high quality data products.
