I.  INTRODUCTION Knowledge Discover in Databases(KDD) is a hot  research area in artificial intelligence and the database currently[1]. Data Mining (DM),which is a very important step in KDD, involves various extraction algorithm of knowledge pattern. The data mining is to discover the fixed pattern or the abnormal phenomenon from the data that naked eye can?t discover, then summaries, analyzsis, and extracts meaningful information and knowledge.The data mining technology is widely researched and applied in many fields in recent years. Not only in computer-related professional, but also in scientific, statistics, artificial intelligence, clinical medicine etc. and it cannot separate with the database widespread application, but the data mining is precisely the database research, develops and applies a most active aspect. It can?t develop so quickly without the wide used of database. and data mining is one of the most active aspect in database research, development and application. In this information explosion age, database can be used in any system. There is mass data in the database, it will have a significance if useful knowledge can be found from these mass data and make the system not only have the OLTP function but also have the OLAP function. Through the data warehouse and data mining system, staff can acquire guidance knowledge and it makes them more efficient in their business area . So the data mining industries are very broad in application prospect. Therefore, data mining has a broad applications prospect in many industries.

As one of the important part of the data mining, Association rules analysis is a very useful knowledge model in database, its mining algorithm has been relatively widely focused and researched. And great progress has been made.

Its algorithm is mainly to discover K itemsets which presents frequently in database and then calculate corresponding association rules. Now many correlation algorithms are improved based on the traditional correlation algorithms, including efficiency of the algorithm, excavation interactive, excavation language research and increasing excavation research and so on[4].

In addition, Multi-dimensional Data analysis and Multi- dimensional Data Cube,which emerged in recent years, are new and effective methods for Data organization, storage, analysis and processing[2]. The multi-dimensional connection rule refers to the connection rule which exists between each attribute. This paper is mainly about an improved algorithm based on traditional Apriori mining algorithm which was used in multi-dimensional association rule excavation and in practical project.



II. ALGORITHM DESCRIPTION AND ANALYSIS At present, the Apriori algorithm is a common algorithm  used in data mining association rule analysis, which discovers frequent itemsets by cascade iteration method based on the candidate produces[3]. But Apriori algorithm is generally used in transaction database which has the characteristics of integrated multiple dimensions, namely, there are multiple items for each dimension .It must be converted to a transaction database if we want to use Apriori algorithm in a relational database,which is not convenient.

Moreover, we only need to calculate frequent itemsets between dimensions when calculating frequent itemsets, but the Apriori algorithm possibly calculates dimension's candidate item set, which increases the times of scanning database, cuts the association rule excavation efficiency. The database is generally multi-dimensional in the reality, for example telecommunication enterprise's data, usually stored in relational database and data warehouse, we must make the corresponding improvement using the data cube knowledge when excavating in the multi-dimensional association rule.

The BUC(Bottom-Up Constructioin) algorithm, which is commonly used in the computation sparse iceberg cube ,is based on apriori pruning algorithm.It has certain efficiency to calculates the sparse iceberg cube,but it is slower than the Apriori algorithm when it is used to calculate the frequent itemsets. The main reason lies in the BUC algorithm use recursive method which makes both space complexity and time complexity is larger than Apriori algorithm. Therefore,   DOI 10.1109/GrC.2010.79     in order to improve the efficiency and keep the multi- dimensional, this paper puts forward a kind of DGP(Dimension Group Parallel) algorithm which is't used recursion,namely this algorithm is designed through group by dimension and divide dimension before the process in order to avoid the repeated division in BUC recursion algorithm.

A. Algorithm Supposes a cube has A, B, C, D four dimensions, and  dimension A has four different value a1, a2, a3, a4; B has four different value b1, b2, b3, b4; C has two different value c1, c2; D also has two different value d1, d2. Add an empty set for each dimension then get the following  results: ?,,,, 4321 aaaa ?,,,, 4321 bbbb ?,, 21 cc ?,, 21 dd Each two dimensions divides into a group, then  A, B divides into group 1L , and C, D divides into group 2L a1 for example, will  produce 11 ,ba 21,ba 31 ,ba 41,ba ?,1a  ?,1a  is an itemset, and 2L also have the similar candidate two itemsets or an itemset. When 1L 2L  formed, counting each itemset except ??,  in 1L 2L After pruning, then carries on the connection to form L, which including four candidate itemsets, three candidate itemsets, two itemsets or an itemset.

For example, 1121 ,,, dcba  is four candidate itemsets, ?,,, 121 cba  is three candidate itemsets, ?? ,,, 21 ca  is two candidate itemsets, then compress the combination which has empty itemset and delete empty itemset. scanning and counting itemset in  We carries the numerical marking to the dimension in the computational process, A, B, C, D were recorded as 0,1,2,3.,then from the beginning time we only needs to scan every two rows which marked 0,1 or marked 2,3 in the relational array when every two dimension connect and count.In this way we reduce the quantity of scanning and there is no need to scan all database when formed an itemset.

C. Algorithm  analysis Compared with the Apriori algorithm, the improved  algorithm reduced the number of itemsets in demension when two frequent itemsets formed, so it can reduce the quantity of scanning in relational database. Moreover ,we only need to scan the specific attribute not the whole database when scanning database.namely, before scanning the database, carries on attribute marking for each item when k candidate itemsets formed and determine which column each item belongs to.When scanning the database, there is only need to scan the corresponding column, so it reduce the possibility of scanning the whole database.

Meanwhile, the improvement algorithm is more suitable for association rule excavation in multi-dimensional     database, and is advantageous for later's function improvement. For example, analysts can choose attributes that he interest. but the Apriori algorithm is one-dimensional, which has only an attribute, therefore it is less flexible than the improved algorithm in attribute choice.



III. ALGORITHM APPLICATION The improvement Apriori algorithm can be used for telecom operators in broadband line classification and in substandard lines?s analysis.

A.  Data pre-processing Test data is the data that didn?t meet the line standards in  local network. In here standard of comparison is the average of the actual line-down rate is less than the average of the configuration line-down rate. Cut the basic data cube in statistical analysis report form according to the test condition,then formed a table that didn?t meet the rate standards. The following are the main work of data mining preprocessing:  1) data extraction: This process can be regarded as the process of cutting the basic cube , extract and association analysis the data that didn?t meet the standards in a month.

And calculate the average value of the same user.

2) data integration: Integrate the extracted data ,the user table and the measuring unit table, and form the excavational table datamine. The user table mainly consists user accounts, IP address and port address; etc. The measuring unit table mainly consists the name of the studio and  area?s flag.

3) data cleaning: Process the datamine table by method of ignore the tuple.It will be ignored if the attribute in the record is null.

4) data conversion: Process the attribute Town_flag(area?s flag) in measuring unit table by using data generalization method, it will be generalized as downtown if the attribute?s value is A, and it will be generalized as the suburbs if the attribute?s value is B or C. The attribute of Pname (equipment name) will be generalized as huawei MA5600, huawei MA5100 ,ZTE and other equipment. Process other attributes by using discretization method. The discretizated attributes's value will be designated to marked interval.Each attribute will be divided into three barrels by frequency ways, as table 1.

Table 1 Quantitative Attributes Discretization Table   Attribut es  Barrel 1 Barrel 2 Barrel 3 Interval  Attributue  flag Interval Attributue  flag Interval Attributue  flag Dnattsp  eed <=1600 Dnattspee  d0 (1600, 2976]  nattspeed1 >2976 Dnattspeed2  Dncfgra te  <=2048 Dncfgrate  (2048, 3072]  Dncfgrate1 >3072 Dncfgrate2  Dnsnrm gn  <=7.6 Dnsnrmgn  (7.6,17] Dnsnrmgn1 >17 Dnsnrmgn2  Dncurra te  <=1215 Dncurrate  (1215 ,2011]  Dncurrate1 >2011 Dncurrate2  Dncurat n  <=10.8 Dncuratn0 (10.8,27] Dncuratn1 >27 Dncuratn2   Deviatio  n_dn  <=685 Deviation_ dn0  (685, 1387]  eviation_dn  >1387 Deviation _dn2   The database formed by data extraction, integration,  cleaning, and conversion.The follow shown is part of the result:  Fig. 1 data excavation databse  B.  Data  maintaining After this, we can excavate the data excavation database  by using the improved Apriori algorithm. For example, when set support=20% and confidence=50%, excavate the database with association rules.We can get the following significant rules.

DNCFGRATE ? 0=> DOWNTOWN, support =27.8% and confidence = 68%  DNCFGRATE ? 0=> DNATTSPEED - 0, support =22.0% and confidence = 54%  Huawei MA5100 && DOWNTOWN DNCURATN=>0, support=21.6% and confidence= 51%  Huawei MA5600=> DNSNRMGN - 0, support =20.5% and confidence= 50%  Huawei MA5600=> DNCURATN - 2, support=30.1% and confidence=73%  DNATTSPEED ? 0=> DNCURRATE - 0, support =26.0% and confidence= 77%  DNCFGRATE ? 0=> DNCURRATE - 0, support = 54% and confidence= 54%   Rule 1  It is usually downtown users in those who?s line  did?nt meet the standards if he has a low configuration line- down rate. So we can do a concentration remediate in downtown..

Rule 2  It will make the up line-down rate low if the configuration line-down rate is low,which will the line don't meet the standards.For those users, we should check configuration problem.

Rule 3  Huawei MA5100 in downtown attenuate very fast,so we can check such equipment.

Rule 4  We should inspect Huawei MA5600 because such equipment has low noise tolerance and it will lead to error and packet loss.

Rule 5 It is one of the reasons for users drop and substandard that Huawei MA5600 attenuate very fast.

Rule 6 If the up line-down rate is low, the actual line- down rate will be low too, and it will make the line wouldn't meet the standards.So we shoud remediate the line of such users.

Rule 7 It will make the actual line-down rate low if configuration line-down rate is low. So we can check the configuration rate.

Thus, the telecommunications staff can use these regular expressions produced by association rules in the broadband line management.It not only can qualitative analyze various problems,but also can pre-process and make a concentration remediate.



IV.  CONCLUSION With specific application requirements for telecom  broadband line quality analysis and in order to improve effciency of excavation in relational database with multi- dimensional association rules. this paper presented an improved Apriori algorithm-DGP algorithm which based on the multi-dimensional association rules. And it was applied for analyzing the reasons why users? line  didn't meet the standards. Practical application shows that the improved algorithm can effectively improve the speed of data mining and enhance the ability of ADSL line quality? s analyzing and solving.
