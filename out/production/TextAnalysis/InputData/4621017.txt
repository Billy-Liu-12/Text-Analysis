Introduction  With the high development of science and technology, the progresses of society, the increasing pressure of modern work, the trend of people?s health states is dropping gradually. The number of people in subhealthy state is enlarging day by day. According to the global investigation of world health organization, it shows that nearly 60% of people are suffering of a kind of the third state, which is called subhealthy state [1] [2]. According to the statistic data of international subhealthy academic conference, the results manifest that subhealthy people are increasing to 70% and 70% of them are the intellectual. The intellectual people are the core force of social progress. College?s teachers have undertaken an important mission and brought up person with high-level ability. So college?s teachers should require the good state of health.

Many researchers have done a lot of researches on the constitution health data of college teachers by traditional math analyzing method.  Some superficial information is obtained easily though traditional query operation from constitution data, but deep level information that hides in the constitution data is difficult to be discovered. Deep level  information usually contains overall characteristics of data and forecast information of data development tendency.

Data mining currently is hot topic research area and is applied in database, artificial intelligence, statistics, and so on [3]. It may discover valuable knowledge and the patterns in the large-scale database for users. Data mining method mainly contains association rule mining, classification and so on [4]. Association rule mining may discover the combination patterns among items. These patterns may instruct the policy-maker to make the corresponding decision.

At present, many scholars have carried on a great deal of researches on association algorithms, such as such as Apriori algorithm or improved Apriori algorithm FP-tree [5]. The execution time of their algorithms was long while searching for the frequent item-set and the rule?s interest degree was low. Even a large number of redundant rules are also included. Besides, the complexity of space and time are high. According to this, an improved association rule mining algorithm is proposed in the paper. It has improved the traditional algorithm, and introduced data cube, relative method in statistics and adaptive adjusting mechanism in intelligence control. The algorithm had two advantages, the first was that the execution time was short while searching for the frequent item-set; the second was that the precision of the rules was high. The algorithm was also used in subhealthy analyzing .The result manifested that the algorithm was effective.

2. An improved Association Rules  The steps of an association rules mining based on data cube as follows:  Step1: establishing data cube from database Step2: mining frequent item-set which satisfies the  minimum support on data cube Step3: generating association rules of frequent  item-set.

Step4: redundant association rules are wiped off  through the relative method       2.1 Establishing Data Cube  Supposed in constitution health database, we observe the data by three dimensional angles. These three dimensions separately are college teacher basic information dimension, college teacher behavior information dimension, and time dimension. Then data cube is obtained through OLAP operation from data base. Figure 1 is data cube by 3-D.

Figure 1. Data cube by 3-D  Each dimension relates to one table that is called dimension table. It carries on further description to the dimension. For example, college teacher basic information dimension contains name, sex, age, income, occupation, hobby, character and so on.

Above the specific angle (dimension) also has many different descriptions in detail degree. This kind of description is called dimension level. One dimension generally has the many levels. For example, the description of time dimension may describe different level from year, quarter, month, date and so on. Year, quarter, month, and date are the dimension level of time.

2.2. Mining Frequent Item-Set On Data Cube  The paper has improved Apriori algorithm. The algorithm searching for the frequent item-set on data cube is called Personal_ Cube_Apriori algorithm.

Represents set of frequent k_ item-set, C  kL k Represents set of  candidate k_ item-set The idea of adaptive adjusting of the Personal_  Cube_Apriori algorithm as follow: Firstly, the algorithm searches for frequent k_ item-set  for each dimension. If some dimensions don?t have frequent k_ item-set, it shows that the dimension level is excessively  low and we should drill through above and improve the dimension level. If in some dimensions, all frequent k_ item-set is frequent k_ item-set, it shows that the dimension level is excessively high and we should drill through under and lower dimension level.

Figure 2 is shown as the flow of Personal_ Cube_Apriori  Input: n dimension data cube ,  minimum support min_sup, k=1 1 2( , , )nd d d count  Output: set of frequent item-set   kL L L= ? _ ( )kL gen frequent C= k  Represents set of candidate  k_ item -set generating frequent k_ item-set 1_ (KC gen candidate L ?= )k  Represents set of  frequent (k-1)_ item-set joining, pruning and generating k_ item-set     Figure 2. The flow of Personal_ Cube_Apriori  2.3. Generating Irredundant Association Rules  After mining out frequent item-set, the process of generating association rules is composed of  two steps?  Step1: regarding to each frequent item-set l, all non- spatial subsets are generated.

sup _ ( ) min_ sup _ ( )  port count l conf port count s  ?    (1)3541      Step2: regarding to each non- spatial subset of frequent item-set l, if  Then the rule s=> (l-s) is generated. min_conf represent the minimum confidence thresholds, support  count(l) represents the number of transaction containing item-set l, support count(s) represents the number of transaction containing item-set s.

Lower interest degree rules are obtained in this way, so the redundant rules must be wiped off. Thus, the paper introduces the relative analysis method in statistics to wipe off the redundant rules. After mining out one association rule, we calculate the correlation among frequent item-set.

Concept of correlation is formula 2  ( ) ( )r  O rCORR E r  =  (2)  rCORR More approaches to 1, the independence among set of r item-set is better. For example, the association rule ?=>? , X, Y are the item-set. If its correlation is worse, it must be the false strong rule.

Relative analysis method is applied in k dimension data cube. If item or dimension Y is ?values, X is  1 2, , , rY Y Y  1 2, , sX X X  s values, ijn  represents the number of X is iY , and X is jX .

Is correlation degree among items, if all items are independent, 2? is 0. Supposed the critical value is assigned. If 2? is bigger than the critical value, X and Y are statistical correlation. Otherwise, they are not statistical correlation. Namely, they are independent.

3. Data Analyzing  After using the above the method in constitution health data analyzing, we can obtain the following results From the table 1, we can see that the number of 40 year old - 50 year old people is the largest,about 43.13%, their subhealthy incidence is the highest, up to 79.1%, the second largest is the group of under 40 years old, every age group subhealthy incidence have significant difference (P=0.000)  Table 1. College teachers? health status comparison of different ages (%)  Age    Health Slight     Subhealth  n % n %  <40 247 23.9 491 47.53  40-50 192 6.17 1536 49.30  50-60 71 3.72 760 39.81  >60 26 2.27 290 25.00  x2 498.64 215.91  P 0.000 0.167   Severe Subhealth  Disease Total  n % n % n %  223 21.59 72 6.97 1033 100%  927 29.80 456 14.66 3111 100%  521 27.29 557 29.18 1909 100%  264 22.3 580 50 1160 100%  215.91 790.80  0.000 0.010   From table 2, the subhealth incidence of 40-50 years old  male teachers is 75.01%, the subhealthy incidence of 40-50 years old female teachers is 82.49%, obviously the female teacher is higher than male teacher (X2=87.503, P=0.000), especially in severe subhealth, female have       significant difference than men (P=0.000).

College teachers? health status comparison under 40 years old (%)   health Slight subhealth  n % n %  man 176 8.99 992 50.58  woman 90 4.11 1049 48.10  x2 123.28 1.90  P 0.000 0.165   Severe subhealth Disease Total  n % n % n %  479 24.43 315 16.00 1962 100  750 34.39 293 13.40 2182 100  113.00 6.41  0.000 0.010   Single factor X2 analysis. The result shows that  influence degree of each dangerous factors to subhealth is as follows (from big to small): working unhappily, living fastidium, feeling unhappy too long, working unfortunately, unsatisfying with current situation, work ability disapproved, lack of physical training, bad house condition, less than 6 hours sleeping, more than 10 hours working time every day .(P <0.05).

Two categorized Logistic analyzing is in the table 3. In order to select the main dangerous subhealth influence factors, above all the factors are introduced to two categorized Logistic regression model. The deleting backward method is adopted to select the prior equation gradually. The results indicate that the main dangerous factors that influence the group of above 40 years old teachers are as follows, lack of physical training, working unhappily, more than 10 hours working time.

Conclusion  According to above constitution health data analyzing, it is shown that the subhealth incidence between 40 and 50 year old people is high. It is thought that the middle age teachers are the dangerous sub-healthy crowds. subhealth condition has related with their jobs. In order to finish strenuous teaching work, research tasks, social work, family burden, the middle aged teachers are faced with competition and high pressure, but they lacks essential healthcare knowledge.

The number of subhealth women is higher than men.

This demonstrates that it?s more difficult for women teachers to pay for too much to equal the same with men.

Besides these, women teachers will undertake more social and family works, such as cultivate their children, take care of their parents, do many housework, relatively they may ignore the state of psychology and health care. When these women teachers are slightly ill, they refuse to go hospital. It will lead that these women teachers may get this illness widely. The trend that the sever sub-healthy will transfer to the diseases has been up, if they don?t cure on time, and it will be the diseases.

In summary, an improved association algorithm is proposed in the paper. The results manifest that the algorithm is effective in constitution health data analyzing.
