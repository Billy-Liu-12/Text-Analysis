I.  INTRODUCTION Facing the intricate training laws of competitive sports, it is  unavoidable that personal experience accumulation would deviate from each other, and the verification of his/her coaching effect often relies on the results of contests.

Generally, this period is calculated in year. Due to the lack of an objective, convenient, and effective manner to evaluate the training effect at ordinary times, a great irredeemable loss has been caused to the country on project input, time cost, and social influence while a problem is found.

The appearance of data mining, representative of modern information technologies based on large-scale information data and knowledge discovery, can effectively assist the coaches and training supervisors to discover the development and change laws of competitive sport items implicated in various competitive sport training information, and remedy the deviation on training instruction due to the shortage of personal ability and technical manner [1]. Because large-scale training and testing information are the comprehensive reflection of form of athletes, we can study the problems of athletes on injury, recovery, and form comprehensive and systematically, and at the same time overcome the previous defect of observing and studying the competitive sport phenomena from a single subject during the data mining of training and testing information.

Data mining technology has been used extensively on commerce, still less on sports, but also there are some successful examples such as that Dick and Sack have  developed a study on carrying out effective advertisement on NBA [2], Seattle Supersonics and Portland Trail Blazers applied successfully this data mining technology to raise the sales income of tickets. Data mining is also used for athlete attendance analysis [3-4] by coaches. During the knockout round in 1997, Orlando Magic found that, the winning rate of the team will be increased if Armstrong attended via data mining analysis, and then put him in the first five and finally made two consecutive victories. In China, there are also some applications such as that, Dai Min applied data mining on the physical ability testing analysis of athletes [5] to solve the problem of physical ability testing indicator optimization; Li Guangjun applied association rule mining on the biochemical data analysis of kayak athletes [6], and classified the athletes according to the biochemical data values.

Starting from time series analysis [7-8], the paper analyses the data recorded during training by coaches, proposes a time series algorithm for data association rule mining, and analyses the change relationship between training items during training from time series.



II. REPRESENTATION AND FEATURES OF ROWING TRAINING DATA  The racing boat training data are the data records of daily training and testing of racing boat athletes, and are the sampling values obtained from each athlete on a series of discrete time points. The d-dimensional time series of m athletes in length of n is recorded as:  {Ai,Xj(tk)}:[i=1,2,?.,m: j=1,2,?.,d :k=1,2,?..,n]  {Ai,Xj(tk)} is the value of athlete A at tk on j-dimension in the series. If only carrying out sampling to a single variable, i.e.

d=1, the obtained time series is called as one-dimensional time series. By contraries, if the sampling objects are several variables, i.e. d>1, the obtained time series is called as multi- dimensional time series. The d-dimensional time series of m athletes at tk can be expressed by a d?n matrix {Ai,Xj(tk)} d?n, shown as Fig.1:     {A1,X1(tk)} {A1,X2(tk)} ... {A1,Xd(tk)}  {A2,X1(tk)} {A2,X2(tk)} ... {A2,Xd(tk)} .

The racing boat time series data not only include single- dimensional time series data, but also include the composite structure of multi-dimensional time series data. During the training of female racing boat athletes, there are 28 commonly- included data types, shown as Table 1:  Serial number Data type  Table 1 Data types of rowing  1 Overload strength training  Serial number Data type  2 12 minutes?4 ergometer training 3 500 meters?8 ergometer training 4 60 minutes ergometer training 5 30 minutes?3 ergometer training 6 8 minutes?5 ergometer training 7 2km ergometertraining 8 6km ergometertraining 9 40 minutes?6 ergometertraining 10 8km ergometer training 11 300 meters?12 ergometer training 12 9km rowing training 13 3km rowing training 14 6km rowing training  15 3.6km?4 rowing training 16 1.2km?6 rowing training 17 1.5km?3 rowing training 18 1.8km rowing training 19 7.2km rowing training 20 500m rowing training 21 11.4km rowing training 22 15.2km rowing training 23 4km rowing training 24 3km running 25 Biochemical data 26 20 minutes ergometer training 27 6km running 28 50 minutes ergometer training

III. GENERAL FEATURES OF DATA VARIATION During the training of racing boat athletes, there are land  training and water training, which are also divided into endurance training and speed training, upper limbs strength training and lower limbs strength training, special training and total physical coordination training. In these training types, some training laws have been grasped such as that, periodical large-load training can raise training achievement remarkably; physical and biochemical indicators can monitor the magnitude of load amount, etc. But there is no any study on the internal relationship between the types of training and testing data shown in Table 1, between which some relationship may exist such as that, the influence of long-distance water training achievement on short-distance water training achievement, and the relationship between 3km long-distance run training achievement and ergometer training achievement, etc. This paper plans to carry out analysis to find out the features of these training data variations and provide reference for the  coaches on training according these time series training and testing data.



IV. ASSOCIATION RULE MINING BASED ON TIME VARIATION TREND  For finding out the relationship between the time series training and testing data items shown in Table 1, this paper carries out analysis in the method of time series association rule mining, which is mainly divided into three steps. Firstly to make data pretreatment, then conducts formalized representation to these data, and finally carry out time series association rule mining.

A. Data pretreatment Racing boat training data are recorded on training log by  coaches according to the daily training situations. For convenient to conduct time series mining to these data, the data pretreatment is divided into two steps. Firstly, to create the training and testing indicator database, store the training and testing items in different datasheets, and store the normalized data in a uniform format.

Secondly, to carry out dimensional selection to the data items in a single table. Because the time series dimensionality of racing boat athletes? training data is high, for avoiding unnecessary knowledge rule base due to higher dimensionality on subsequent analyses at time variation points, carry out dimensional selection before mining to find out the dimensions strongly related to training achievement and eliminate those unrelated or with small influence to reduce the number of series dimensions.

B. formalized representation of data variation trend There are 28 types of data in the data record of time  variation series chosen at this time. To choose 26 types of data (two types of data have a few tests), which can be just expressed in 26 English letters. Some data increased and some decreased. Express the increased data items in 26 lowercase letters and those decreased in 26 uppercase letters, then the time series variation values can be expressed as a letter series, such as (Duan Jingli) dcYcEcPCEcyxeh ? In this expression, such as the first record in Table 2, the data item is 4, which indicates the achievement of 60 minutes ergometer training known from Table 1, the variation value of 1 is 121, which indicates her achievement raised 121m, and increased variation type, therefore it is expressed in lowercase letter d; in the third record, the data item is 25, which indicates the value of hemoglobin, the variation value of -1, and decreased variation type, therefore it is expressed in Y, and the others are similar.

Each letter indicates a variation value at a time point. If taking the time window of 6, the data shown in the above table can be expressed as the record item in the following Table 3:  To converse the above data items as data record, shown as Table 4:       C. Association rule mining After the time series data variation record is generated, can  carry out association rule mining. One of the most famous cases for association rules is the story of ?Beer and Diapers?. It is a real case generated in Wal-Mart (America). Wal-Mart owns the largest data warehouse system in the world. For accurately understanding the buying habits of customers at its stores, Wal-Mart analyzed and mined these data in the method of data mining, and found unexpectedly that: the most  purchased commodity together with diapers is beer! The paper plans to analyze the variation relationship of training data from the time series data in the analysis method of association rules.

In the association rule mining, by Apriori Algorithm firstly calculate the frequent item-set 1 and generate the results shown in following Table 5, then generate frequent item-set 2, frequent item-set 3 ?, and finally generate the association rules. The association rule mining in the paper uses the famous globally-free data mining software, Weka.



V. MINING RESULT AND ANALYSIS The experimental data is taken from one year?s data of a  female racing boat training team, and are carried out by the above time series association rule mining software and algorithm. Take those with minimum support level of 2% and minimum confidence level of 60% to obtain the results shown in Fig.2. It can be seen from the figure that, the larger the time window, the more the obtained association rules; when the time window is 25, the number of obtained association rules is 147, while the time window is 3, the number of obtained association rules is only 2.

Tim e w indow   size           1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25  Fig . 2  R ules obtained at different w indow  size  N u m b e r o f a ss o ci a ti o n r u le s    In the obtained association rules, some are repetitive such as P5(t)?p2(y), P6(t)?p3(y), and P7(t)?p4(y), which are eliminated and only one of them is retained, and partial obtained association rules are shown in the following table 6:  In the first rule, p12 indicates the No.12 time point in the time window, T indicates that the used time of 500m water training is reduced, p14 indicates the No.14 time point in the time window, and G indicates that the used time of 2km ergometer training is reduced. The meanings of the first rule is that from the rise of 500m water training achievement can result in the rise of 2km ergometer training achievement, and this rule informs the coach that the achievements of 500m and 2km short-distance water training rise synchronously. In like manner, the fourth rule indicates that, the rise of 2km ergometer training achievement and overload capacity can  result in the rise of 4km water training achievement. The fifth rule indicates that, the decrease of the used time of 500m water training results in the decrease of the used time of 1.5km water training. The combination of the rules No.1, 4, 18, and 24 indicates that, the achievements of short-distance training items of 500m, 1.5km, 2km, and 4km promote each other.

The seventh rule indicates that, the increase of the used time of 1.5km water training results in the decrease of the used time of 7.2km water training. The eleventh rule indicates that, the increase of the used time of 1.5km water training can result in the decrease of the used time of 6km ergometer training.

The thirteenth rule indicates that, the fall of finished distance of 30 minutes ergometer training (30 minutes ergometer training is equivalent to 7km ergometer training) results in the decrease of the used time of 15.2km water training. The     twenty-fifth rule indicates that, the decrease of the used time of 2km ergometer training can result in the increase of the used time of 11.4km water training. Combined these rules, it can be obtained that, the rise of short-distance water training achievement can result in the fall of middle-distance achievement, and the rise of middle-distance achievement can result in the fall of long-distance achievement. Likewise, the rise of long-distance achievement can result in the fall of middle-distance achievement, and the rise of middle-distance achievement can result in the fall of short-distance achievement.

The fifth rule indicates that, the decrease of the used time of 1.5km and 4km water training can result in the decrease of the used time of 11.4km water training. The twenty-second rule indicates that, the decrease of the used time of 11.4km and 4km water training can result in the decrease of the used time of 1.5km water training. These two rules indicate that, the rise of short-distance achievement can result in the rise of long- distance achievement, similarly, the rise of long-distance achievement can result in the rise of short-distance achievement, i.e. the achievements of long-distance and short- distance promote each other.

The fourteenth rule indicates that, the decrease of the used time of 6km ergometer training can result in the decrease of the used time of 3km long-distance run. The twenty-eighth rule indicates that, the decrease of the used time of 3km long- distance run can result in the decrease of the used time of 6km ergometer training. These two rules indicate that, the achievements of 3km long-distance run and 6km ergometer training promote each other. The sixteenth rule indicates that, the increase of the used time of 3km long-distance run results in the decrease of the used time of 11.4km water training. This rule combined with the eighth and thirteenth rules further indicate that, the effect of 3km long-distance run training is consistent with that of 6km ergometer training.

The second rule indicates that, the decrease of the used time of 500m water training can result in the fall of hemoglobin content. The twenty-seventh rule indicates that, the decrease of the used time of 1.5km water training can result in the fall of hemoglobin content. These two rules indicate that, the rise of short-distance training achievement can result in the fall of hemoglobin content. The sixth rule indicates that, the decrease of the used time of 6km ergometer training and the increase of overload capacity can result in the increase of hemoglobin content. The tenth rule indicates that, the increase of hemoglobin content and overload capacity can result in the decrease of the used time of 2km ergometer training. These two rules indicate that, the rise of hemoglobin content can result in the rise of 6km ergometer training achievement. This also certifies indirectly that the rise of 6km middle-distance achievement can result in the fall of short-distance training achievement. The reason is that, if the short-distance achievement also rises while the 6km middle-distance achievement rises, it would cause the fall of hemoglobin content, which is contradictory to the sixth rule.

The third rule indicates that, the decrease of the used time of 6km ergometer training and the fall of hemoglobin content result in the increase of the used time of 11.4km water training.

The twenty-sixth rule indicates that, the increase of the used time of 15.2km water training results in the fall of hemoglobin content. These two rules indicate that, the fall of long-distance training achievement is directly related to the fall of hemoglobin content.

The twenty-first rule indicates that, the decrease of the used time of 500m water training results in the enhancement of overload capacity. This rule indicates that, the rise of the overload capacity is closely related to the rise of 500m water training achievement.



VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS This paper discovers some hidden training laws hard to be  perceived via time series association rule analysis such as that, the rise of short-distance water training achievement can result in the rise of long-distance water training achievement, the rise of long-distance water training achievement can promote the rise of short-distance water training achievement, etc. This training law can explain why the achievements of China National Team rose greatly and it obtained many medals on international contests after it adopted 12km training in approx 2000. Some laws can be used for the coaches as reference to improve their training methods such as that, via the discovered training laws these can be known that the training effect of 3km long-distance run is consistent with that of 6km ergometer training, and the rise of 6km ergometer training achievement would reduce the achievements of short-distance and long- distance training. The coaches can adjust the training items properly according to these training laws. The next works are to apply and verify these association rules and stipulate scientific training methods to raise the achievements of contests in the future training.
