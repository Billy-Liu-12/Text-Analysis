Extraction of 2D-Pattern Signatures for Protein Folds

Abstract? Protein contact map is a 2-dimensional represen- tation of the protein tertiary structure. It is conjectured that proteins of the same SCOP structural fold give rise to ?similar? contact maps. The goal of this work is to investigate this hypoth- esis. We adopt data-driven approach by extracting conserved 2D-patterns within contact maps of proteins and validate the fact that many conserved patterns do correspond to structural elements within the corresponding protein tertiary structure, thus providing a potentially fast method for protein structure comparison. An efficient linear algorithm that extracts patterns from a contact map is implemented to create a 2D-pattern data base. Checking for redundancy is a time-consuming step and we apply an approximate 2D-pattern matching algorithm in order to obtain significantly distinct 2D-patterns. Using the framework of Class based association (CBA) rule mining, these patterns are then composed to form a ?signature? for a protein fold. Further, these 2D-features from contact maps are used successfully in addressing the challenging problem of protein fold classification.

I. INTRODUCTION.

PROTEIN STRUCTURE comparison and alignment isa difficult problem involving issues of invariance and a/symmetry in 3-dimensional geometry. The two dimensional (2D) representation of the tertiary structures provides a useful tool in this context. Mining and analysis of protein contact maps produce useful insights for the problems of structure alignment and structure prediction [23], [17]. For the problem of Ab initio structure prediction, protein contact map prediction [22] is considered as an intermediate step enroute to predicting structure from the primary sequence of the protein.

A contact map is a two dimensional representation of a protein structure. The contact map of a protein having n amino acid residues, (A(i, j)) is an n ? n matrix where A(i, j) = 1 when the i-th amino acid is within a distance of 7Ao from the j-th amino acid and 0 otherwise. Contact maps display clearly the secondary structures: alpha-helices appear as thick bands along the diagonal, beta sheets being parallel or orthogonal to the diagonal as shown in Figure 1.

It is exciting to note that the dots in the off-diagonal region correspond to interactions between secondary structures.

Zaki et al. [10] mine contact maps and show that the off- diagonal interactions can be annotated as being ? ? ?, ? ? ?, ??? interactions among the secondary structure elements (SSE). Proteins are divided by SCOP [14] classification into folds based on the ?folding? of the SSE?s. Barah et al. [2] analyze protein contact maps and hypothesize that proteins  Suvarna Vani.

belonging to the same fold have ?similar? contact maps.

Bhavani et al. [3] carry out an empirical study of contact maps, predict SSE?s from the contact maps and extract useful ?fold? information from the off-diagonal.

Turcotte et al. [21] propose rules for fold prediction based on Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) using features pertaining to the protein 3D-structure. The aim of this study is to present an algorithmic framework which eventually extracts ?signature? of a fold using only 2D-features extracted from contact maps. These patterns are analyzed for their significance in terms of their correspondence to the 3D motifs which in turn may have a role in function and structure of the protein. We validate the whole chain of ideas by considering these as features and apply class-based association (CBA) rule mining algorithm in order to perform multi-class classification of protein folds.

II. MINING 2D-PATTERNS FROM CONTACT MATRICES.

Zaki et al. [10] extract 2D sub-matrices of a fixed-size, say, w, from the contact matrix of size n. This is a time- consuming step of order 12 ((n?w)? (n?w)), and further, may not retrieve a structural pattern as a whole. They propose a fast hashing scheme for redundancy removal while storing a pattern in the data base [23]. While Zaki?s scheme gives patterns of fixed size and only checks for identity, we propose a novel yet simple algorithm here that extracts continuous patterns in a given contact matrix in linear time. The patterns extracted are of variable length and further not only identical but approximately similar patterns are removed from the data base. We formulate an approximate 2D pattern matching algorithm based on the algorithm of Bird et al. [4] in order to remove redundancies. There are other sublinear 2D pattern matching algorithms available in the literature which we do not consider in our implementation [8].

A. Approach  The diagonal band of (width 4) the contact map is masked inorder to extract the 2D patterns from off-diagonal region of the contact map. Continuous 2D-patterns are extracted from the contact map using an algorithm whose idea is the following: Start from the left top corner of the triangular contact matrix, find ?1? and extract a continuous pattern of 1?s by considering intersecting Moore-neighbourhoods of ?1? and return the pattern when the neighbourhood is empty. An example of a pattern retrieved is shown in Figure 2. Repeat this step at the next ?1? that has not been considered yet. The density of the retrieved pattern is computed and non-trivial ones are stored for future use. The algorithm is presented in Algorithms 1,2.

Fig. 1. 1C07: A protein from EF-Hand fold and its contact map in which the helices are clearly seen as thick bands  Fig. 2. Continuous 2D Pattern Extraction Sample  The more time-consuming step is to find if an ?approxi- mately similar? pattern exists in the data base. The standard 2D-pattern matching algorithm of Bird et al. [4] is applied to match the extracted pattern with those that are already stored in the data base. Bird and Baker algorithm is extension of Aho and Corasic one dimension dictionary matching algo- rithm to 2D setting. By applying an approximation threshold, if the patterns match by more than 66%, then that pattern is discarded and not stored in the data base. Thus redundancy checking is implemented and in the process, a data base containing significantly different patterns is created.



III. DATA SET  The data set of Ding et. al [6] is considered as a bench mark data set in the literature for protein folds. This data set contains proteins with less than 35-40% sequence iden- tity representing all classes and further contains proteins belonging to 27 most populated folds, representing all major structural classes of All-Alpha, All-Beta, Alpha + Beta and Alpha / Beta. The number of proteins being considered for each class and the corresponding fold information are presented in the Tables I, II. These proteins are downloaded from the protein data bank [12] for which the contact maps have been computed.

The minimum density threshold in the Pattern Extraction algorithm 1 is varied between 2 - 5 and we experiment with all the contact maps of the data set for four different thresh- olds.

IV. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE EXTRACTED PATTERNS: A FEW CASE STUDIES  A few significant patterns from the data base (DB) that have been automatically extracted by the Pattern Extrac- tion algorithm are presented here along with respective 3D structural motifs. PyMol [13] software has been used to find out the corresponding 3D substructures. Further, we demonstrate how through only 2D analysis we are able to retrieve specific 3D-substructures which are of biological and structural significance.

A. EF-Hand fold  The EF-hand motif contains a helix-loop-helix topology, in which the Ca2+ ions are coordinated by ligands within the loop [9]. It consists of two alpha helices positioned roughly perpendicular to one another and linked by a short loop region (usually about 12 amino acids) that usually binds calcium ions. The interactions between the short anti-parallel beta sheets are circled in the Figure 3, and the corresponding 2D pattern is shown in the Figure 4. We quote [9], ?... the EF-hand consists of a nine-residue entering helix, a nine- residue loop and an 11-residue exiting helix. An additional secondary-structural element is observed in the pair as a small -sheet formed between residues in the latter part of the loops, through which passes the pseudo-2-fold axis of symmetry that relates the EF-hand pair, in most cases the functional unit of Ca2+ binding (PDB code 1EXR)?. Clearly it is quite exciting to retrieve a significant pattern through the pattern mining algorithm.

B. Cytochrome C fold  Two significant patterns of Cytochrome C fold are shown in the Figures 5,6. We find that the ?C?-like pattern in Pattern 27 corresponds to the well-known Cytochrome C heme group which is an organic molecule, arranged in a circle, with an iron atom in the middle [1], [5], [19]. The iron atom in  collabration with the rest of the heme molecule is said to induce oxygen attracting properties in the entire molecule.

Pattern number 6 corresponds to interactions within a long loop region which is again specific to this fold.

C. Four helical up and down bundle  The four helix bundle is a common structural motif among natural proteins. In this motif four helices pack is arranged roughly lengthwise. Structurally, the four helix bundle can occur as an isolated fold or as part of a larger protein. Four helix bundles have been observed in numerous medically important proteins such as human growth hormone [20]. The pattern shown in the Figure 7 corresponds to the beta hairpin structure in this fold.

Fig. 7. Beta hair pin found in 1CGO protein of Four helical up and down bundle  In Table III, we summarize generic and specific nature of a few of these patterns. For example, pattern 42 is seen only in 4-Helical up and down bundle whereas pattern 4 (P4) is present in many of the folds in All-alpha class.



V. PROTEIN STRUCTURAL CLASS AND FOLD PREDICTION  It is clear that these 2D patterns may turn out to be useful features in order to distinguish the folds. Protein fold prediction is a challenging problem with the best average accuracy reported in the literature being 71% [15] who use 18 sequence and 3D-structural features in their methods.

Since the data set is highly unbalanced, boosting algorithms have also been applied to address this complex problem [18]. Since our aim is to obtain ?signature? of each fold, we adopt the framework of class based association rule-mining developed by Liu et al. [11]. CBA-rule generator(CBA-RG) generates frequent ruleitems. By setting the thresholds for support and confidence, class association rules are generated which are used for fold classification. We carry out the classification experiment on the bench-mark data set given by Ding et al [6]. The 2D patterns as well as the SSE?s extracted from the diagonal region [3] constitute the features.

Ding et. al consider protein sequence features of amino acid composition, predicted secondary structure, hydropho- bicity, normalized vander waals volume, polarity and polar- izability. Shamim et. al consider 9 types of features which combines sequence and structural features to acheive 71%.

The sequence features include amino acid composistion, first order amino acid pair (dipeptide) composition and second order amino acid pair (1-gap dipeptide) composition. The structural features include secondary structural state frequen- cies of amino acids, dipeptides and 1-gap dipeptides, solvent    Fig. 3. The typical orthogonal pair of helices is seen which are attached by a short parallel beta sheet. The region connecting the helices gives rise to a significant pattern to EF-Hand fold.

A. Feature Sets  The data set as given in Table I containing 640 proteins is divided into training set and test set in the ratio 80:20 proportional to each class. For the fold classifcation experi- ment, the data set (Table II) of All-Alpha proteins which are 116 in number are divided into training set and test set in the ratio 80:20 and five fold cross validation is carried out.

Each protein is represented as a feature vector using three different sets of features.

1) Feature set 1: Secondary structural features from the diagonal region of the contact map are extracted using the algorithm given in an earlier work [3]: number of helices, minimum and maximum helix length, number of beta strands, minimum and maximum beta length.

In this work, the algorithm finds the optimal width and length thresholds using which then extracts helices and beta strands in the diagonal region of the contact map.

A sample of results obtained by this algorithm for the All-Alpha class is given in the Table IV.

2) Feature set 2: The off-diagonal interactions which are extracted as 2D patterns using the Pattern-Extraction algorithm of section 1 are taken as features. As men- tioned earlier, we work with the 126 significantly different 2D-pattern features.

3) Feature set 3: We combine Feature set 1 and Feature Set 2 to constitute Feature set 3. A snapshot of the feature vector table is given in Table V.

B. Classification Algorithm  We use the well-studied Class Based Association (CBA) Rule Mining algorithm in order to extract rules for classifica- tion [7]. Frequent pattern mining is a core procedure within the CBA algorithm.

Step 1: Prepare the pattern vector table for the entire data set.

Step 2: Divide the table into training set and test set in the ratio of 80:20.

Step 3: Find train-set patterns from the pattern vector table using the Apriori algorithm which satisfy specified minimum support and confidence values.(minimum support=2, confi- dence=30%) Step 4: Generation of frequent item sets satisfying the support and confidence values.

Step 5: Generation of top 10 itemset-rules.

Example: Pno6=1,Pno27=1 ? F=f1 < ((P1, 1), 3)((F, f1), 3) > < ((P2, 1), 2), ((F, f2), 2) >  We list the top 3 itemsets that are derived by the algorithm in the Table VI  C. Evaluation measures  Results are tabulated using standard measures of  Precision(P ) = TPTP+FP Recall(R) = TPTP+FN  F-measure (F) = 2?P?RP+R where TP, FP and FN are the number of true positives,  false positives and false negatives.

D. Results  The top 10 association mining rules are then used on the test set and the results obtained are tabulated in the Tables VII, VIII, IX for structural class and fold prediction. Clearly, better classification accuracy is achieved by using Feature Set 3 which uses both the diagonal SSE?s and the off-diagonal pattern features as shown in Table IX. Also, note that the accuracy (Recall) results obtained are better in most cases when compared to the best in the literature those of Ding et al. and Shamim et al. who use high dimensional feature vectors composed of both structural features and the amino acid composition features.

VI. CONCLUSION  Novel features have been obtained by mining protein con- tact maps using a simple and effective pattern extraction algo- rithm. It proves to be very effective in extracting continuous patterns of variable sizes from contact maps, in linear time, unlike the sliding window algorithms in the literature which give fixed size patterns and take quadratic time. Further, we demonstrate correspondence of these patterns to specific substructures within the tertiary structure whose importance    TABLE IV PREDICTION SECONDARY STRUCTURE FEATURES FROM THE CONTACT MAP  Class Fold ProteinID #of helices  min helix length  max helix length  #of beta strands  min beta length  max beta length  1 Globin 1ASH 8 5 19 4 3 5 3 Cytochrome C 1CCR 5 3 12 4 3 6 4 DNA/RNA binding 3-helical bundle 1APL 3 10 13 3 4 6 7 Four helical up and down bundle 1LPE 5 8 38 3 3 6 9 Four helical cytokines 1BGE 6 3 28 5 3 8  11 EF-Hand 1REC 8 3 12 6 3 6  TABLE V FEATURE VECTOR TABLE  ProteinID P1 P2 ? ? ?

The effectiveness of these features is tested by using these to carry out fold prediction which is a challenging multi-class classification problem. This method is of importance because protein contact maps can be predicted from the primary sequence [22]. We show that using class based associative mining algorithm, a ?signature? can be composed for each fold in the All-Alpha fold structural class with an accuracy of nearly 90%. The classification experiment is being extended to all the structural classes and the 27-way fold classification is being carried out in which the alpha+beta structural class poses a challenge.
