EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS OF FACULTY PERFORMANCE OF  MANAGEMENT DISCIPLINE FROM STUDENT FEEDBACK USING

Abstract- This paper deals with the extraction and analysis of faculty performance of management discipline from student feedback using clustering and association rule mining techniques. The performance of a faculty of any school or an Institute has been found to be dependent on a number of parameters broadly ranging from the individual?s qualifications, experience, level of commitment, research activities undertaken to institutional support, financial feasibility, top management?s support etc.The  parameters which are crucial for assessment of faculty performance range across various verticals, but the paper discusses and  covers the performance of  faculties based strictly on students feedback only. The other assessors of faculty performance being the Management Body which could be a private body or a Government unit, self and peer faculties of the organization or the University. The parameters act as performance indicators for an individual and group and subsequently can impact on the decision making of the individual and also the stakeholders. The idea proposed in this paper is to perform extraction and analysis of faculty performance using techniques of Data Mining. The rationale behind using Data Mining is to cluster faculty performances on various criteria subject to the certain constraints and also extracting the dependencies amongst the parameters which will help finding meaningful associations between them. These associations in turn help to identify new patterns for decision making. The paper restricts to students feedback from Computer Applications Department across accredited institutes. The analysis depends on many attributes and the paper justifies the usage of mining methodologies rather than following the conventional approach.

I.  INTRODUCTION The need of Data Analysis and Mining in higher  education is to mine faculty and students data from various stakeholders? perspective [7]. In the previous paper we have shown the rationale behind using statistical and mining tools to analyze and extract patterns in faculty performance. The methodology adapted to design the Faculty Performance Assessment and Monitoring framework has been dealt extensively in the previous papers and relevant parameters identified based on which the assessment will be carried out.

[16].In the next paper around 3000 student records were taken into consideration[17].The data was smoothened and profiled, inconsistent data was removed. The data was then subjected to analysis using conventional approach and further by implementing statistical and mining techniques (classification and level 1 clustering) and certain conclusions were arrived at. In this paper we have shown data preprocessing and clustering based on attribute class and its type and the dependencies between the parameters under the category of student feedback. The faculty performances have also been extracted using clustering techniques with regard to specific timelines. Below is the graph (Figure 1) depicting the same and the results display normal trends i.e. with time the performance of an individual soars high. The graph depicts the performance based on student feedback for a faculty and encompasses feedback for elective as well as compulsory subjects.

Fig.1 Faculty Performance Semester wise  The above graph is a snapshot of few faculties and the other snapshots also show a normal trend. The justification of implementing statistical analysis and mining algorithms was required to extract intelligent information and to perform complex calculations, trend analysis and sophisticated data modeling, and reporting. The need was to identify critical information on the not so obvious data that would enable better decision by the academia.

II. DATA CLUSTERING AND ANALYSIS The student feedback data after preprocessing using the  WEKA preprocessor was subjected to filter where all the numeric attributes were transformed to the nominal form and the clustering algorithm was applied on the individual as well as the set of attributes/parameters and different cluster statistics were found. The analyses of the different clusters have given some interesting results as shown in the table below. The figure 2 shows the count of students against the lowest and the highest value set for each parameter taken into consideration. The deduction arrived at was that students had given due weight age to subject knowledge and knowledge beyond syllabus (both being parameters) and not considered the other parameters to be of much importance and relevance. The parameters which we have taken into consideration are: ? Su-Subject Knowledge ? Te-Teaching with new aids ? Mo-Motivating self and students ? Co-Communication Skills ? Cla-Class Control ? Pu-Punctuality and Regularity ? Kn-Knowledge beyond syllabus ? Ag-Aggregrate  Another interesting observation made was the variation in focus of a student while filling up the feedback form. It was seen that initially the parameters are marked with more consciousness and concentration and then it dips down and again goes to a high towards the end. The student concentration, consciousness and effort factors are given much consideration to avoid biased or inconsistent data in the feedback. Currently we are measuring these factors against a recorded scale after testing the feedback form on a group of students whom special instructions were given while filling the feedback form.

Fig. 2 ? Students behavior while giving feedback  Table 1- Cluster Instances of Faculty Performance         As per the clustered instances depicted in Table 1 taking into consideration the numeric and nominal attributes the student comments ranged from poor to very good with satisfactory receiving the highest vote. This data is the cumulative performance of all faculties taken into consideration. For faculties in different grades such as Lecturer, Associate Professor the ratio of various comments is shown as below in Figure 3 and each comment category as observed shows a similar trend against each faculty category with the category good and poor having almost the same baseline for both categories of  the faculty.

PerformanceIndicators    Lecturer Associate Professor  Designation A  ve ra  ge  Very Good(Avg)  Good(Avg)  Satisfactory(A vg)  Poor(Avg)   Fig.3 Comment Ratios versus Faculty Category   The extraction of all the above data has been possible by  using the data mining classification and clustering technique.

The correctly classified instances were identified by running the classification algorithm on the training data subsequently generating the confusion matrix which showed the distribution of the comment category across the matrix and also gave the detailed accuracy in terms of True Positive and False Positive rate by class. Next the preprocessed training data was subjected to clustering and for each attribute class based on the lowest and highest value; the feedback count for each value was recorded and depicted through the above graph as shown in Fig 2. Similarly Figure 3 represents cluster results across comment category and across designations. The extraction of different types of result would have been very time consuming or not possible if conventional methods had been followed.



III. ASSOCIATION RULE ANALYSIS After the clustering has been performed the student  feedback data was subjected to association rule mining. The Association Detection is basically to detect relationship between specific values and extensively helps in finding hidden trends which range from areas of business practice to research. The association rule mining has been implemented to undermine the hidden trends in Faculty performance and their behavior. The Apriori Algorithm was used effectively to find out the best rules or associations. The lower bound and upper bound minimum support range was given between .1 and 1.0 and the algorithm was executed on 2890 correctly classified instances. Following results were derived from mining the database. The minimum support was found to be 0.3(867 instances) and the minimum metric confidence was found to be 0.9.The best rules with metric value ranging  Student's Marking Pattern   2000 Lowest(0)  Highest(5/10)  Expon.

The number of cycles performed by Apriori was found to be fourteen for generating the best rules. With increasing size of the database and with increase in the number of parameters Apriori takes time to generate the associations or rules discussion of which is not within the scope of the paper.

IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK  The future work will contain analyzing further trends in faculty performance based on student feedback, changes in faculty behavioral changes and also evaluation of faculty performance across the other verticals as management, peer, self and other regulatory bodies. The future work can also extend to comparative evaluation between various streams and various institutes running Management courses.
