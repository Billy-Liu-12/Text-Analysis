The initial application of association rule mining was on market basket data [1]. An association rule is a relationship of the form X=>Y, where X and Y are sets of items. X is called the antecedent and Y the consequence. An example of the rule can be, "customers who purchase an item X are very likely to purchase another item Y at the same time".

There are two primary quality measures for each rule, support and confidence. The rule X=>Y has support s% in the transaction set D if s% of transactions in D contains X and Y.

The rule has confidence c% if c% of transactions in D that contain X also contain Y. The goal of association rule mining is to find all the rules that exceed user specified support and confidence thresholds.[2]  The following are characteristics of association rule mining on remotely sensed imagery:  * In remotely sensed imagery, each pixel can be considered as a transaction.

* Each transaction (pixel) has the same number of items, which is the number of bands.

* Special types of association rules: we are particularly interested in the kinds of rules where the left side of the rule is a combination of band intervals while the right side of the rule  978-1-4244-3531-9/08/$25.002008 IEEE  Yongbin Liu2 2.Department ofComputer Science University ofFinance & Economics  Tianjin, China qingbin1iu(l63.com  is a particular interval of yield band. For example: B1-low A B2-high A B3-mid => Y-high, Where BI-low={Bandl,0-93}, B2-high={Band2,192-255}, B3-mid={Band3, 93-191 },Y-high={Yield, 192-255}.

Besides accessing to the huge volume of remote sensing data with a variety of remote sensing platform and development of sensor technology but it is difficult to carry out effective treatment.

Based on these characteristics, we propose a new approach, which partition massive remote sensing data into several independent blocks in which uses bitset to organize remote sensing data. Efficiency is an important issue for a mining algorithm. By using partition and bitset, the association rule mining algorithm only scans transaction database twice with fast computation.

This paper is organized as follows., 1. a TP-PB algorithm is described in Section. 2. Experiment results and performance analysis are given in Section 3. Finally the TP-PB algorithm is applied to crop remote sensing image for association rules mining.

2. TP-PB ALGORITHM Given a user specified minimum support (minsup) and  confidence (minconf), the task is to find association rules where support and confidence are at least minsup and minconf.

This can be broken into two steps:  I Find all itemsets with support above minsup (find all frequent item sets).



II. For each frequent item set, derive all rules that are supported by that set which have at least minconf. That is: given a frequent item set, X, find all antecedent subsets, A of X, such that rule, R: A => (X-A) has at least minconf.

Various improved algorithms have been proposed to discover correlations in large itemsets. Most of them are variations of the Apriori Algorithm[3][4][5][6]. Overall performance of association rules mining is largely determined by the first step. Generally speaking, these algorithms first construct a candidate set of large itemsets based on some heuristics, and then discover the subset that indeed contains large itemsets. This process can be done iteratively in the sense that the large itemsets discovered in one iteration will be used as the basis to generate the candidate set for the next iteration.

We propose a new approach, which partition massive remote sensing data into several independent blocks in which     uses bitset to organize remote sensing data. Firstly, this algorithm divides massive database into several independent blocks logically. Boolean values are stored in the compressed BitSet in each of block. It generates frequent itemsets by Bitset logical AND operation replaces database scans for each of block. Then it unifies the frequent itemsets and generates global candidate itemsets for the whole data. At last it calculates the min-support of these global candidate itemsets and generates global frequent itemsets for the whole data.

In the first phase of the algorithm for remote sensing data ,according to the predefined range of remote sensing images (Remote Sensing Image, RSI) data to process discrete quantitative attributes of the image , then divided into several non-overlapping blocks. The second phase, according to the mapping Bitset of association rules mining algorithm, mining frequent itemsets of each of the block, then it unifies the frequent itemsets and generates global candidate itemsets for the whole RSI data.The final generates global frequent itemsets for the whole RSI data. A modified Apriori TP-PB algorithm is given below.

EXPERIMENT RESULTS AND PERFORMACE ANALYSIS  We compare our work with the Apriroi algorithm in the same database, hardware and software environment. The experiments are performed on a Pentium-4 3.0 GHz desktop computer with 1024 megabytes main memory, running Windows XP. We got identical rules by running the Apriori and TP-PB algorithms.

However, using TP-PB algorithm can continue running and improve efficiency. So TP-PB algorithm adapt to large-scale data on a better basis.

The following are the advantages of the TP-PB algorithm  * It avoids scanning over the entire transaction database each time in generating frequent k-itemsets.

* It only needs little memory. Because it uses the BitSet class to store frequent itemsets .

* It is competent for large-scale RSI data, expanding Apriori algorithm.

4. TP-PB ALOGITHM IN MINING OF RMOTE SENSING IMAGE  I Remote Sensing Image Data Source  The remote sensing image according as sensor is divided into many different types, such as the United States land resources satellite TM, the French SPOT, meteorological satellites AVHRR. This paper make remote sensing images of TM as an example to data mining study of remote sensing image. TM includes seven-band which are B (Blue), G (Green) , R (Red) , RIR (Reflect-Infrared) , MIR (Mid-Infrared), TIR ( Thermal-Infrared) and two MIR (Mid-Infrared) Radiation resolution of Each band are 8-bit  Scope(Value of Pixels: 0 - 255). This paper choose TM Image of crops before harvest and corresponding to the yield map of the same area go to process association rules mining.

Yield map is 8-bit (Range 0 - 255). This paper use three visible light band of TM image:B (Blue), G (Green) and R (Red), but a yield map only contain attributes yield :Y (Yield).

Now we have four attributes in our database. They are: pixel-number, blue(bandl), green(band2), red(band3) and yield (Y). The problem of mining association rules from this imagery data is to discover the associations between bandl, band2, band3 and Y. This will help farmers to understand what combination of spectral bands will have a high crop yield.



II. Attribute Partitioning  The TP-PB algorithm can only handle categorical market basket data. When we have quantitative attributes in database, we cannot directly apply techniques of association rules mining. We can use a Boolean value TURE or FALSE to express the relationship between item and transaction. To deal with quantitative data, the most common method simply partitioned the attribute values into intervals. We separate the attribute value into uneven, discrete depth according to the histogram for each band of image. The "item" would be "1" if the attribute has value fall within the interval, and "0" otherwise. Table 1 shows the result of the partition of four attribute.

TABLE 1 PARTITION OF FOUR ATTRIBUTE VALUES  Attribute Band discretization Partition band Band  1 [0,35] BI -low  2 [36,55] B I -mid B 1  3 [56,255] BI -high 4 [0,75] B2-low 5 [76,160] B2-mid B2 6 [161,255] B2-high 7 [0,40] B3-low B3     Association Rule mining using TP-PB  the rules of fulfilling the minimum support and minimum confidence is strong association rules. The association rules the user likes to mine are in the form of: {B1,B2,B3} =>Y. Now we know that B 1, B2 and B3 are Antecedent and yield is Consequent. Assume the minsup = 15% and minconf= 50%, We derive following association rules:  TABLE 2 ASSOCIATION RULES  ID Rules  1 B 1-mid =>Y-high Sup:33.5%, conf:75.3%  200 B I -mid, B2-high =>Y-high Sup:25.3%, conf:73.3%  1105 B1-mid, B2-high, B3-low =>Y-high Sup:22.1%, conf:70.6%  From the table 2 we can see the rule, B 1-mid, B2-high,B3-low =>Y-high, Sup=22. 1 %,Conf=70.6%, which means "Bi reflectance falling within 36-55, B2 reflectance at least 161 and B3 reflectance at most 40 implies Yield will be at least 171 ,namely, the high yield". This correlation shows that we can adjust the soil moisture, fertilizer and crop growing to change to increase crop yield, or through remote sensing to crop yield assessment.

5. CONCLUSION AND PROSPECT In this paper, we presents TP-PB algorithm. It applies two  phases Association Rule Mining one based Partition and Bitset for massive Remote Sensing Images data. Firstly,this algorithm divides massive database into several independent blocks logically. Boolean values are stored in the compressed BitSet in each of block. It generates frequent itemsets by Bitset logical AND operation replaces database scans for each of block. Then it unifies the frequent itemsets and generates global candidate itemsets for the whole data. At last it calculates the min-support of these global candidate itemsets and generates global frequent itemsets for the whole data. By dividing the massive data into a number of blocks, it enhance generic application of algorithm ;Besides it increases algorithm efficiency that database scans is replaced by Bitset logical AND operation in each of block, especially for massive remote sensing image data. And the algorithm has been applied to remote sensing images Mining Association Rules in precision agriculture.

The sequential algorithm is not very suitable for large databases because large-scale databases are generally great (in GB and TB). Parallel algorithm is used to improve efficiency on Massive Data Mining. Partition technology is very suitable  for parallel computing. So the next step, the focus of our work is the combination of parallel computer expands TP-PB algorithm. This will further improve the efficiency of the algorithm.
