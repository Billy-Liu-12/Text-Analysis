Practical Industrial Robot Zero Offset Calibration

Abstract? Current manufacturing trends require industrial  robot to be more and more accurate in order to accomplish  more and more complicated manufacturing processes. Robot  calibration enables standard robots to achieve higher  accuracies. Many complex and/or expensive calibration  methodologies have been developed and implemented  successfully. However, they are difficult to be used in the  manufacturing floor because of the cost and flexibility.

Therefore, a calibration method that can be used to calibrate  robots easily and economically will have a big market impact.

Among all robot kinematics parameters, robot zero offset has a  much larger influence on robot positioning accuracy. To  accurately calibrate the robot zero offset, we developed a  practical industrial robot zero offset calibration method that  can be used in the manufacturing floor without high skill  requirements of the operators. The method is based on tracking  a laser line in the robot workspace. The robot joint angles are  recorded during the tracking. Using the joint angle data, the  robot zero offset can be estimated. The estimated value is then  used to offset the encoder to evaluate the estimated values.



I. INTRODUCTION  Industrial robots have been used to accomplish more  and more complicated tasks and/or achieve higher  process quality. This requires industrial robots to be  more and more accurate between the tool frame and the  work object frame. Robot calibration is typically used  to enable standard robots to achieve accuracies  comparable to much more expensive equipment such  as CNC machines and CMMs, etc.

Although there are many parameters to be calibrated in  order to put the robots into production, kinematics  parameters are among the most important because their  differences between the controller and the actual robot  account for most of the errors between the base frame,  the tool frame and the work object frame. Many robot  kinematics parameters calibration systems and  methodologies have been developed in both academia  and industry [1, 2, 3, 4]. Some of these systems have  high accuracy when calibrating these parameters, for  example, robot absolute accuracy calibration at the  robot manufacturer?s facilities using expensive  calibration systems, such as laser tracker. However, the  price range of these systems is still very high. This  makes these expensive calibration systems difficult to  be widely used in the manufacturing floors. As more  and more industrial robots are installed, one of the  issues is how to calibrate these robots easily and  economically.

As we know, there are several kinematics parameters,  such as arm length, joint center offset, the twist angle,  joint angle and etc. Typically, the arm length, joint  center offset and twist angle are related the mechanical  structure of the robot itself. These parameters are  calibrated at the robot manufacture?s facilities and do  not change too much after the robot is shipped and  installed in the manufacturing areas. According to [5],  97% of the robot accuracy issues are caused by the  robot zero offset.  Since the shipping and installation of  a robot could affect the zero offset, it is important to  calibrate it before the robot is put into production.

Hence it is essential to develop a practical industrial  robot zero offset calibration method that can be used  daily in the production floor. Moreover, a zero offset  calibration system that is easy to set-up, operate and,  most important, more economical will have high  demand in manufacturing automation using industrial  robots.

Although there are many existing methods that can be  used to calibrate the robot zero offset, they are either  very expensive or difficult to use [6, 7]. Newman et. al.

[8] developed a straight line method for robot  kinematics parameter calibration. The method is easy  to set up and use. The simulation results showed that  some of the robot kinematics parameters can be  calibrated. However, implementation and validation  using industrial robot are not discussed in the paper.

In this paper, we will focus on developing a practical  industrial robot zero offset calibration method based on  tracking a straight laser line. The positioning errors of  the robot end-effector are analyzed using the robot  kinematics model. The relationship between the  Heping Chen, Thomas Fuhlbrigge, Sang Choi, Jianjun Wang and Xiongzi Li  Robotics and Automation Lab  ABB Corporate Research Center  2000 Day Hill Road  Windsor, Connecticut 06095  4th IEEE Conference on Automation Science and Engineering Key Bridge Marriott, Washington DC, USA August 23-26, 2008       kinematics parameter errors and the end-effector  positioning errors are developed. To implement the  developed method, a laser pointer is mounted and fixed  on any fixture and pointed to the robot tool. The robot  tool is controlled to move along a laser line and the  robot joint angles are recorded. Based on the recorded  joint angle, a joint angle error estimation method is  developed. An optimization problem is formulated to  estimate the robot zero offset. a pattern search method  [10] is applied to solve the optimization problem to  obtain the joint angle offset. Experiments were  implemented to validate the developed methodology.



II. CALIBRATION METHODOLOGY  A. Analysis of Kinematics Model Error  For the robotics system with n+1 links as shown in  Figure 1, the kinematics can be represented using the  following equation:  ? =  += n  i  i  i TT   1                                                     (1)  Where T is the transformation matrix of the robot tool  relative to the robot base; 1+i i T is the transformation  matrix of link i.

Figure 1. A robot with a tool. The tool should have an offset  from the tool0 center in order to identify the joint 6  parameters. Tool0 is the center point of joint 6.

Suppose there are K parameters in each link, i.e.,  ),...,( 11 K  iiii  i xxfT =+                                              (2)  Where ),...,( 1 Kiii xxf is a transformation matrix  function of the ith link; k  ix  is the kth link parameter  and K is the number of the total link parameters.

? =  + ?  ? =  K  k  k  ik  i  i i  i dx  x  f Td   1                                               (3)  For the robot kinematics matrix T in equation (1), we  have    ?? = = ?  ? =  n  i  K  k  k  ik  i  dx x  T dT  0 1  (4)  Where  ? =  ?  ?  ? =  ?  ? n  j  n  nk  ik  i  j  k  i  Tdx x  f T  x  T     0 ......

However,  0= ?  ? k  i  j  x  f if  ji ?                                                  (5)  Hence,  n  n K  k  k  ik  i  i n  i  Tdx x  f TdT     0 ...... ?  ==  ?? ?  ? =                            (6)    Considering there are small deviations in the link  parameters, we have    n  n K  k  k  ik  i  i n  i  Tx x  f TT     0 ...... ?  ==  ?? ? ?  ? =?                            (7)  Where T?  is the error of the kinematics matrix; k  ix? is the deviation of each link parameter. Therefore,  if T?  can be measured, the deviations of the link parameters can be calculated based on equation (7).

However, traditional methods are either very expensive  or difficult to implement. Therefore, a line based  method is developed to estimate the deviations of the  link parameters.

B. D-H model Based Parameter Estimation  Because D-H model [9] is widely used on robot  forward kinematics problem, it is adopted here as an  example to estimate the deviations of the link  parameters. However, the method described above is  not limited by the D-H model. Using the D-H model,  1+i  i T  can be written as:  ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  ??  ?  = ????  ????  +   coscossincossinsin  sinsincoscoscossin  0sincos  111i1i  111i1i  1-iii   iiiii  iiiii  i  i  d  d  a  T ??????  ??????  ??  (8)  The parameters are determined using the following  definition:    n  i R??  The angle between 1?iX  and iX  measured about iZ ,  n  i Rd ?  The distance from 1?iX  to iX  measured along iZ ,  n  i Ra ?  The distance from iZ  to 1+iZ  measured along iX ,  n  i R??  The angle between iZ  and 1+iZ  measured about iX .

By taking derivative of equation (8) with respect to the  joint angles, we have:    ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  ? ? ? ?  ?  ? ?  = ?  ?  ??  ??+   00sinsin-sincos  00cossin-coscos  00cossin-  1i1i  1i1i  ii  i   ii  iii  i T  ????  ????  ??  ?  (9)    Defining,  n  n  i  i i T  f TT    0 ...... ?  ?  ? =  ?   then,   ? =  ?=? n  i  iiTT  ?  By defining,  ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  =   iz  iyi  ix  i t  tR  t  T ,  we have,  ? ? ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  ? ? ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  =  ? ? ?  ?  ?  ? ? ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  =  =  =  n  i  iiz  n  i  iiy  n  i  iix  t  t  t  z  y  x     ?  ?  ?  (10)    Therefore, the relationship between the joint angle  deviation and tool positioning errors are established.

From equation (10), we can see that the joint angle  deviation of the joint angle and the position is a linear  relationship.

C. Line Based Calibration Method  If the robot tool in Figure 1 is moving along a line as  shown in Figure 2, the joint angles of the robot can be  recorded.

Figure 2. The robot tool is controlled to move along a  straight line. The joint angles are recorded.

Due to the joint zero offset, the recorded tool positions  mjzyxp ajajajj ,...,1),,,( =   are not exactly on the line.

From the recorded data and the model developed in  equation (10), we have      ? ? ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  ? ? ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  ?+  ?+  ?+  =  ? ? ?  ?  ?  ? ? ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  =  =  =  m  i  i  j  izaj  m  i  i  j  iyaj  m  i  i  j  ixaj  tj  tj  tj  tz  ty  tx  z  y  x     ?  ?  ?  (11)  Where ],,[ tjtjtj zyx are the ideal tool position. The  ideal line equation can be expressed as,  ? ? ?  ?  ?  ? ? ?  ?  ?  +  +  +  =  ? ? ?  ?  ?  ? ? ?  ?  ?  tz  bty  atx  z  y  x     (12)    Where ( ),, 000 zyx can be estimated using equation  (10):  ? ? ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  ? ? ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  ?+  ?+  ?+  =  ? ? ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  ? ? ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  =  ? ? ?  ?  ?  ? ? ?  ?  ?  ? ??  ? ??  ? ??  ?  ?  ?  = = =  = = =  = = =  =  =  =  m  j  m  j  n  i  i  j  izaj  m  j  m  j  n  i  i  j  iyaj  m  j  m  j  n  i  i  j  ixaj  m  j  tj  m  j  tj  m  j  tj  t m  z m  t m  y m  t m  x m  z m  y m  x m  z  y  x  1 1 1  1 1 1  1 1 1              ?  ?  ?      Since the tool positions calculated from the recorded  joint angles are not exactly on a straight line as it  supposes to be, the distance from the points to a  straight line is minimized to find the robot zero offset.

Figure 3 shows the distance from ),,( ajajajj zyxp  to  the line (12).

Figure 3. Distance from a point a line.

The distance from jp to the line can be calculated as:  222 )()()( jajjajjajj zzyyxxd ?+?+?=  Where ( ),, jjj zyx is a point by projecting the point  ),,( ajajajj zyxp  to the line (12). To find the joint angle  deviation and the line parameters (a, b), we minimize  the total distance:  ? +  =  =   min m  j  jdd                                                   (13)  The parameters are (m+2) because there are two fitted  line parameters (a, b). Since this is a quite complicated  optimization problem with 8 parameters, a pattern  search method [10] is used to minimize the distance  errors.



III. EXPERIMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION AND RESULTS    To implement the developed method, experiments  were performed to calibrate the robot zero offset for  each joint. An ABB IRB4400 robot with IRC5  controller was used as shown in Figure 4. A laser  pointer is used to generate a straight line that is  mounted on a vise. The pin hole on the robot tool  flange is used as the real tool.

The D-H parameters of the ABB IRB4400 are listed in  Table 1. The pin hole (Joint 7 in Table 1) on the robot  tool0 (the center of joint 6 and defined using D-H  parameters) flange is used as the calibration tool in  order to identify the joint angle offset for joint 6. The  reason that the pin hole was chosen is that its position  is accurate relative to the center of the tool with an  known offset. Other accurate tool with known  parameters could be used too.

However, due to  the limitations of hardware and software setup, the  robot is jogged manually to the center of the pin hole.

This could cause some errors in collected joint angle  data. Since we only plan to verify the concept for the  robot zero offset calibration based on moving the robot  along a line, manual control should be good enough. In  Pin hole       the future, we will develop an automatic robot  localization method to center the laser to the center of  the pin hole.

When the robot is controlled to move along the laser  line, the joint angles are recorded. Using the D-H  model, the tool positions are calculated. Figure 5  shows the calculated tool positions.

Figure 5. The calculated tool positions based on the recorded  joint angles.

After processing the recorded data, the robot zero  offset can be calculated. Several sets of experiments  were performed. The zero offset of ABB robot is then  calculated. Table 2 shows the calculated robot zero  offset using the straight line method in different  experiments.

Joint 1 Joint 2 Joint 3 Joint 4 Joint 5 Joint 6  0 1.9595 0.7219 1.2834 1.1918 1.1345    From Table 1, we can see that the joint 1 angle offset is  0. This is because the calibration method based on the  straight line cannot be used to identify the joint 1 angle  zero offset. We can only get the slope of the line, not  the absolute position of the line due to the line fitting  method. This is the limitation of the method. However,  the joint 1 angle offset is not so important because it  defines the robot base frame. If the robot base frame  rotates, other frames can be calibrated based on the  rotated base frame. Therefore, the line based method is  good enough to improve the robot accuracy.

After the robot zero offset is calculated, we also put it  back into the D-H model to calculate the tool position.

Figure 6 shows the tool positioning errors without  considering the zero offset compensation and Figure 7  with the zero offset compensation. From the two  figures, we can see the positioning errors are greatly  reduced with zero offset compensation. The errors in  Figure 7 could be caused by the manual method to  move the laser line to the center of the pinhole. The  errors are less than 0,2 mm that is reasonably caused  by the manual method.

Figure 6. The positioning errors of the tool without the zero  offset compensation. In actual applications, ABB robots are  calibrated with zero offset. Therefore, the errors are much  smaller.

The RMS of the tool position errors relative to the  straight lines was also calculated. The value is 37.1537  before the zero offset estimation and 0.5719 after the  zero offset was added.

Figure 7. The positioning errors of the tool with the zero  offset compensation.

To validate the zero offset calibration results,  experiments using an expensive positioning  measurement device, Romer (ww.wromer.com), were  also performed. Figure 8 shows a Romer used to  measure the tool position. The accuracy of the Romer  is about 0.01 mm that is much more accurate than the  robot.

Figure 8. A Romer is used to measure the robot tool position.

After the positions were measured by the Romer, the  data are processed to obtain the zero offsets. The  results are shown in Table 3.

IV. FUTURE WORKS  The robot is controlled to move manually along the  laser line. This could cause the positioning errors  during the alignment. To reduce the alignment errors,  an automatic alignment method will be developed.

Currently, we only identify the most important robot  kinematics parameters joint angle offsets. We will  investigate to use the method to identify other robot  parameters mentioned in the paper.

The pattern search method used in the paper could  generate local minimal values. Therefore, optimization  methods will be investigated to process the data and  get the real robot offset values.



V. CONCLUSIONS  Robot calibration enables standard robots to achieve  higher accuracy to satisfy the requirements of the  current complicated manufacturing processes. Among  all robot kinematics parameters, robot zero offset has a  much larger influence on robot positioning accuracy.

We developed a practical industrial robot zero offset  calibration method that can be used in the  manufacturing floors without high skill requirements  of the operators. The method is based on tracking a  laser line in the robot workspace. The robot joint  angles are recorded during the tracking. Using the joint  angle data, the robot zero offsets are estimated. The  estimated values are then applied to offset the robot  joint angles to evaluate their accuracy. From  experiments, much smaller errors were observed when  the identified zero offset values were applied to control  the robot to follow a line. Experimental results  demonstrated that the developed practical method can  be used to calibrate the robot zero offset values easily  and economically.
