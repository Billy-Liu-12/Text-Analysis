Applying Proven Technologies for a near Term, High  Confidence Heavy Lift Launch Vehicle

Abstract?The use of well understood, legacy elements of the Space Shuttle system could yield a near-term, high- confidence Heavy Lift Launch Vehicle that offers significant performance, reliability, schedule, risk, cost, and work force transition benefits.  This side-mount Shuttle- Derived Vehicle (SDV) concept has major improvements over previous ?Shuttle-C? concepts delivering 78 mt to LEO at an estimated recurring cost of $5,000 per kg. This paper provides the latest data and estimates on the configurations, performance, concept of operations, reliability and safety, development schedule, risks, costs, and work force transition opportunities for this optimized side-mount SDV concept. As shown in this paper the SDV is capable of launching large demonstration and initial operational capability Solar Power Satellite missions.
