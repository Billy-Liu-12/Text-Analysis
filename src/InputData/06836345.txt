The IRIS Mission - Development of the

Abstract-The Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) is a NASA Small Explorer Mission that was launched on 27 June 2013. Its goal is to discover how the outer atmosphere of the Sun is energized. The investigation is conducted with a  free-flying observatory in a sun-synchronous, low earth orbit, a  mission operations center and ground data system at NASA  Ames Research Center, and a ground network supported by  NASA NEN ground stations and the Norwegian ground  stations at Svalbard. The observatory consists of a spacecraft  bus that includes the attitude control system, the power control  system, the command and data handling system, and the RF  communications system and the scientific instrument including a 20 cm telescope, an imaging spectrograph, and supporting electronics. This paper describes the development and testing of the observatory and the ground data system, highlighting the unique aspects of this mission.
