A Process Model Oriented to System Service

Abstract?We present a new conception of process service which is the extension of workflow. The separation of process logic from business logic is the key for building such service in system layer. However, the separation idea is often hard to be implemented because of inherent coupling characteristics in business process applications. None of workflow systems, including flexible workflow systems, is very successful in that aspect. We have analyzed WFMC model and find that there exist several defects in it. The model lacks necessary criterion and some of the elements are so inexplicit that they?re implemented excessively randomly in workflow systems. We think that it?s the root of the separation problem. We design a new model for process service. Compared with WFMC model, both the composition and the structure are changed. Especially, we constitute a framework on the model to realize the separation idea really and truly.

I. INTRODUCTION There?re two kinds of fundamental service furnishments  in the computer: operating system and net service system (called WEB service ordinarily). Operating system provides local service for applications running on single machine and net service system supports applications running on the network. In the view of software architecture, net service system is the extension of operating system [1] [2]. A single computer can be regarded as that there?s only one machine in the network.

The appearance of net service system, such as .NET and WEB logic, makes it easy to develop distributed applications, the developing mode of which is almost the same as that of local applications [3] [4]. C/S is the typical structure of distributed applications. Usually, the disposal of the business is mainly on the server and the request is on the client.

Although the composition of a C/S system may be quite complex, it can be divided into one client node and one server node logically, namely, all of the servers is looked upon as one node from the angle of the client.

However, multi-clients will be required when the task becomes huge. The task is segmented to several parts. Each client is responsible for the operation of one part. This mode is called CSCW (Computer Supported Collaborative Work).

A style of CSCW system has been paid most attention to, which is process system. The segments of the task abide by a basic rule, sequence, in process system. It means that the  segments are disposed of step by step as a whole. So, compared with other CSCW system, the collaborative logic in process system is more legible and easier to manage.

Workflow is the abstraction of business process [5].

There?re two sorts of contents in a business process application. One is the content of the business and the other is the relationship among the task segments. Those two aspects have their respective terms in workflow: business logic and process logic. The idea of workflow is to separate process logic from business logic. Thus, a common software to manage process logic can be established to support all kinds of business process applications. That software is called WFMS (Workflow Management System) and there have been over 100 WFMSs in the market or in the institute.

The separation idea of workflow is consistent to former two services: operating system and net service. Their essences are all of separating fundamental service from the application [6]. But it seems that none of WFMSs has achieved the goal of the separation very well, even it can be said that they?re still far from the goal. The reason will be analyzed in this paper and a new conception called process service will be presented.



II. DYNAMIC ASSOCIATION BETWEEN PROCESS LOGIC AND BUSINESS LOGIC  The separation idea of workflow can be illustrated with ?Fig. 1?.

Figure 1. A business process application  There?re some activities in ?Fig. 1? and the relationship of the activities are expressed by the structure of the flow graph. Business logic is inside the activity and process logic is in the relationship among the activities. An activity will submit the message to WFMS when it finish the business.

Then, WFMS will schedule successive activities according to process logic which has been defined. However, it will be found that ?Fig. 1? is just an ideal circumstance with deeper analysis of the question. In fact, the association between process logic and business logic is the most simple one, which is called static association in this paper.

??  Business logic  Process logic  ___________________________________     Another sort of association also exsits universally in business process applications. ?Fig. 2? is an example to show it.

Figure 2. Loan business process  This is a loan examination process. The business is interpreted as follows,  1) Loan application: The applicant submits loan form.

The loaned value and loanee?s credit value are extracted.

2) Loan examination: Case 1 denotes that loaned value is less than $100,000 and the loanee has good credit. Case 2 denotes that loaned value is greater than $100,000 or the loanee has bad credit.

3) Responsibility: The clerk is responsible for Case 1 and the manager is responsible for Case 2.

The association between process logic and business logic in this examnple is more complex than that in ?Fig. 1?.

The applicant and the loaned value can?t be known until the loan application is submitted. So, the route of the business can?t be confirmed when a loan business hasn?t happened.

Namely, the route of the business is associated with business data, as is called dynamic association between process logic and business logic in this paper.

The existence of dynamic association indicates that it?s a native characteristic that the business and the process are coupling together. Coupling forms are various and may be quite complicated. ?Fig. 3? shows another example which is far more complex than that in ?Fig. 2?.

Figure 3. Order business process  A commercial company has received an order of some goods. The amount of the goods is am. There?re some providers which the company can contact with. But the providers supply not only this one company but also others.

So, the amount of the goods that a provider can provide for a specific commercial company sometime is uncertain. The disposal of the business is described as follows,  1) Contacting with providers: The commercial company contancts with the providers to get the amount of the goods that they can supply with. Suppose the amount of provider i is ami.

2) Judgment of the order: The company judges whether there?re enough goods for the order. Namely judges whether  amami >? . If no, it?ll reject the order. Otherwise, continue.

3) The selection of providers: The company selects the providers which can satisfy the order with computing the amount of the supply.

The above commercial business also has dynamic association between process logic and business logic. It belongs to uncertain selection essentially. In workflow, it haven?t been found that there exists any flow pattern to express such logic. So, maybe none of workflow systems has implemented the logic directly.



III. THE DEFECTS OF WORKFLOW SYSTEM AND FLEXIBLE WORKFLOW SYSTEM ON DYNAMIC ASSOCIATION  Since there?s no unified framework for dynamic association, the methods of the expression and the disposal of the problem are various in different workflow systems [7] [8]. The following solutions are only used to illustrate conventional pattern of the development, not referring to any concrete system.

Relative code is for the loan business example in ?Fig.

2?. ?Fig. 4? shows how to deal with dynamic association problem in workflow system.

Figure 4. The disposal of dynamic association in workflow system  It can be seen that the code of process logic and that business logic are mixed together. Even because some workflow systems don?t have the function to support the operation of start(Activity) directly in business code. The developer of business process applications has to develop that function outside workflow system himself, as increases extra burden for the development.

?Fig. 5? shows the solution to same example in flexible workflow system. It can be seen some progress has been made. The rule, which is like the form of ?if ? then ??, is specifically used to deal with the problem of dynamic association in flexible workflow system [9] [10]. Process logic is separated from business logic in some degree with such mode. However, the key of the coupling problem hasn?t been solved yet. The rule usually uses business information directly and it?s written in the program also, as  ??  Reject  Provider 1  ? ?  Provider n  Company  Order  ??  Case 1  Case 2  Manager  Clerk  Loan  credit=get(loanee.credit); if (credit==?bad?) then start(managerActivity); ?? (Other business disposal) loanvalue=get(loanform.value); if (loanvalue<100000 and credit==?good?) then start(clerkActivity) else start(managerActivity);    will yield a lot of troubles, especially when the process needs to be reconstructed.

Figure 5. The disposal of dynamic association in flexible workflow  Suppose that the logic of the loan business are varied as follows,  ? Case 1: Loaned value is less than $100,000 or the loanee has good credit.

? Case 2: Loaned value is greater than $100,000 and the loanee has bad credit.

The names of some variables are changed either.

Variable credit is changed to loaneecredit and loanvalue to loanedvalue. ?Fig. 6? shows the reconstruction of the example in flexible workflow system.

Figure 6. Process reconstruction with dynamic association in flexible workflow system  The rule is rewritten with the business program and they both have to be rebuilt.

It?s obvious that the solutions to dynamic association in workflow system and flexible workflow system don?t accord with the idea of separating process logic from business logic very well. So, it?s impossible for present WFMS to become a system service of process management.



IV. PROCESS SERVICE AND THE PROCESS MODEL FOR IT Firstly, we give the definition of process service.

Definition: Process service is a system service which  manages business process. It supports dynamic association and simple process reconstruction.

In this definition, two factors are emphasized, 1) Dynamic association between process logics and  business logics.

2) Simple process reconstruction.

It?s known that WFMS isn?t fully suitable for the requirement of process service. The root is that dynamic association hasn?t been adequately considered in WFMC model. ?Fig. 7? is the sketch of that model [11].

Figure 7. WFMC model  Workflow relevant data denotes the data which is related with both process logics and business logics. This is a ambiguous item. There isn?t any criterion for workflow relevant data. As a matter of fact, it?s also impossible to give the criterion because of the variety of business information.

Another improper item is that transition conditions are put into activity. What transition conditions express is the relationship among activities. They shouldn?t belong to any one activity.

A new process model is presented in this paper for process service. ?Fig. 8? shows the model.

Figure 8. Process model for process service  Some new elements, which are event, state and rule, are added to replace workflow relevant data and transition conditions. The structure of process model is also reformed accordingly. The new elements are expatiate as follows,  1) Event: The occurrence of the behaviors in process system is abstracted as event. There?re two kinds of events in process service system: system event and business event.

System events are predifined in the system and business  Process  Refer  Activity  Rule  Has  Role Refer  Event  Has  Invoked application  Call  Refer  State Consists of  Refer  Has  Has  Refer  Workflow type definition  Consists of  Activity WorkflowRelevant data  Has  UseRole Refer  Transition conditions  Has  Invoked application  Call Use  Refer  loaneecredit=get(loanee.credit); loanedvalue=get(loanform.value); ?? (Other business disposal) -------------------------------------------- Rule: if (loanedvalue<100000 or loaneecredit==?good?) then start(clerkActivity); if (loanedvalue>100000 and loaneecredit==?bad?) start(managerActivity);  credit=get(loanee.credit); loanvalue=get(loanform.value); ?? (Other business disposal) -------------------------------------------- Rule: if (loanvalue<100000 and credit==?good?) then start(clerkActivity); if (loanvalue>100000 or credit==?bad?) start(managerActivity);    events are difined by the developer of business process applications freedomly.

2) State: Process, activity and role all have states. Being similar to event, there?re also two kinds of states in process service system: system state and business state.

3) Rule: It?s the expression of process logic. There?re two kinds of rules: even-state rule and state-action rule. The general form of the rule is sultCondition Re? . Unlike felexible workfolw, it isn?t written in the program but in the process templet. ?Fig. 9? shows that in XML form. The rule is interpreted by process service system.

Figure 9. Rule in XML form  All of the elements in process service model have strict difinitions, as is different from WFMC model. For reasons of space, the details of the difinitions are omitted.



V. UNIFIED FRAMEWORK FOR PROCESS MANAGEMENT A unified framework for both static association and  dynamic association is established with process service model, which is unlike flexible workflow where flexible portion is usually independent of WFMC model [12]. ?Fig.

10? shows the sketch of the framework.

Figure 10. The framework for process management in process service  The dashed is the boundary between business disposal and process disposal, which incarnates the idea of the separation of process logic from business logic. The loan business process in chapter 2 is used to expatiate it. ?Fig. 11? shows the implementation of it in process service system. It can be seen that business information doesn?t mixed with process logic any longer and the separation is successful.

Simple process reconstruction is also realized with the new model. ?Fig. 12? shows the reconstruction of loan process in process service system. Only Event-State rule needs to be changed. Since there?s no modification to the program, recompiling and rebuilding of the program aren?t required here.

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK We analyze dynamic association process logic and  business logic and find it?s it?s a native characteristic of business process application. But the association hasn?t been paid sufficient attention to in workflow, which leads to WFMC model can hard cope with a number of businesses.

Flexible workflow has made some progress. However, there still exist some serious problems. First, a flexible workflow system often only aims at some specific flexible problems.

Second, flexible workflow usually solves problems of dynamic association outside WFMC model, as makes that two schemes exisit in one system at the same time.

Since workflow system and flexible workflow system both haven?t realized the idea of separating process logic from business logic, we present a new conception of process service. The conception places process management in the layer of system service firstly. The problem of dynamic association is taken into account roundly in process service model. New model elements are added and model structure is reformed. Particularly, a unified framework for both static association and dynamic association is established.

The scheme of Event-State rule and State-Action rule is the core of process service model. The rule is constructed by the means of symbolic logic. Yet the contents of process logic exceeds the capacity of basic symbolic logic a lot. So, it has to be expanded to satisfy the requirement in business process. The expansion to symbolic logic will be researched detailed in our future work.
