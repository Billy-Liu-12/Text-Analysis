Abstract?According to acquiring data from the meta-search engine and getting information in specific websites, the author proposes an extraction model based on Web information which is used to construct network relationships of the subject based on its semantic link. Then based on the proposed model above, the author does content mining and semantic analysis on the Web data of five big cities (Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou, and Chengdu) with the help of self-made ROST Content Mining System, to get first 30 high-frequency e- government words respectively, and takes Shanghai for specific analysis; Meanwhile, the author, using ROST WebSpider to collect the web page from level 1 to 3 of governments? websites in Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou and Chengdu, constructs the evaluation model SCISS to do comparative analysis on the development of the five metropolis? e-government. Finally, the author comes up with some countermeasures, aiming to provide advice for the development of e-government in china, according to the empirical analysis.

I.  INTRODUCTION  Researches of progressive analysis and content mining on the data generated in e-government network services have become the hot spot in information science. Jarl K Kampen and his partners did analysis on the citizens? preference data of Flanders?s government website, coming to the conclusion that every government will provide more on-line services, but citizens need better ones[1]. Li, Honglai and Le, Zhongjian proposed the second relative evaluation method, in accordance with the importance and fairness of e- government evaluation [2]. Liu Honglu and Tian Zhihong put forward the personalized information services framework based on the Web content mining model after analyzing on these e-government systems that fulfill users? individualized needs and then designed and developed the experimental system for Web log mining, which established technical foundation for individualized e-government services[3]. Ou Jing-ying and his partners took advantage of the decision tree, association rules, clustering algorithm, to analyze on the hotline services provided by e-government, in order to provide reference for decision-making, managing, and serving[4] .

One informative government has become one of the key  factors to enhance global competitiveness of a country or a region[5-6]. But in terms of Chinese e-government, there are many problems in urgent need of improvement and there are  no researches focusing on overall data acquisition and deep analysis based on e-government in China[7]. This paper analyzes China?s e-government situation based upon Chinese situation, aiming to provide reference for its development in both theory and practice.



II. INFORMATION EXTRACTION  A. Informaction Extraction Model At present, the methods to acquire information related to  some keyword belong to two ways: one is to search the information related to the keyword in search engines; the other is to acquire information in websites related to the keyword. The former method can help to get information in wide coverage, but has bad pertinency and depth, the latter helps to get accurate and deep information, but covers narrowly of the Internet. So, we decide to propose a model which combines information acquisition in search engines and information mining in specific websites with the help of our self-made software, ROST Content Mining System[8].

Firstly, we monitor web pages returned from the four  huge search engines(Google, Baidu, Sougou, and Youdao), and then extract data from the returned pages; secondly, we get data of some specific websites; finally, we conduct the process of content analysis and social network mining using the acquired data. The information extraction model described above shows in Fig. 1:      Figure 1.  Information Extraction Model based on Web.

DOI 10.1109/ICMeCG.2009.48    DOI 10.1109/ICMeCG.2009.48    DOI 10.1109/ICMeCG.2009.48    DOI 10.1109/ICMeCG.2009.48    DOI 10.1109/ICMeCG.2009.48    DOI 10.1109/ICMeCG.2009.48    DOI 10.1109/ICMeCG.2009.48       B. Basic Algorithm Considering the fact that the data acquired from the meta-  search engine is complex and pluralistic, we propose ?adaptive text segmentation and co-occurrence algorithm? to achieve effective analysis on the data.

First, we extract the key content in corresponding  sections according to the format of the acquired data, then we use the ROST Content Mining System to get the original Chinese words segmentation set, taking advantage of the software to keep the proper nouns in related fields with the help of its self-defined word list. After that we screen the data in the original Chinese words segmentation set, calling the filtering word list to get the rightsizing text data set.

Second, we conduct ?extraction non-repeated words in each line? which means exactly comparing the Chinese words in each line of the rightsizing text data set to get the non- repeated data set of each line. Third, we add one to the frequency of their relationship between two words if they appear in the same line, which causes to get the co- occurrence data set. Finally, we use ROST CM to get the first 200 (adjustable parameters) available words according to their frequencies in a descend order in the co-occurrence data set to form the visible semantic network graph.

The specific algorithm shows below:  1) Pre_ExtractContent (Data Set) 2) Div_Word (DataSet); 3) Get_CustomList (DataSet); 4) Get_FilterList (DataSet); 5) For i = 1 to DataSet.LineNum Step 1 6)  For j = 1 to DataSet.LineSet[i].WordNum Step 1 7)      If (Co_Occur()) 8)             Cooccurrence_Count++; 9) Co_Occur_Sort (DataSet); 10) DrawFig (DataSet);

III. CASE STUDY  A. Analysis on Five Metropolis' E-governments based on Meta-Search Engine Based on adaptive text segmentation and co-occurrence  algorithm, we acquire e-government data of the five key metropolis in China respectively, and then we do content mining on the acquired data. During the process, we add one to the frequency of their relationship if one word appears together with e-government in each corresponding web page.

So after filtering the meaningless words, we get the first 30 high-frequency words in semantic relationship respectively for these five metropolis to construct the table of e- government in Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou, and Chengdu. The table is shown in Table I: According to the statistics of e-government in Beijing,  Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou, and Chengdu based on word frequencies, we come to the following conclusions:  ? Words like "technology", "research", "university" and specialization field are hot in the five metropolis, indicating that technology researches  and training are the core issues in the process of e- government construction.

? "enterprise" and "bid" are among the high-frequency words of Guangzhou and Chengdu, implying that other than government departments' direct constructing, enterprise outsourcing is a excellent way to solve the problems.

? "safety" appears in high frequency in four of the five metropolis, indicating the great importance of security in the process of e-government development. But "safety" does not exist in Wuhan's semantic high-frequency words, which shows that security should be taken into consideration more seriously by Wuhan government when developing e- government.

? How to make procurement more reasonable and efficient has been focused by the governments of Beijing, Guangzhou, and Chengdu, as procurement is governments' unavoidable behavior.

? "share" is only related to Guangzhou, reflecting that the idea of information resources sharing occurred to Guangzhou earlier than the other metropolis. Sixth, although one of the core goals to construct e- government is to enhance the communication between government departments and citizens, none of the five cities has words related to communication. So improving communication services should be one of the key issues to be done as soon as possible.

B. Analysis on Shanghai E-government based on Meta- Search Engine Using the model proposed in section 2.1, we take  Shanghai to do our case study. First, we input ?Shanghai E- government? into the searching box of ROST Content Mining System, which causes the returning of 2665 pages of website abstracts from the meta-search engine (749 pages from Baidu, 662 pages from Google, 290 pages from Youdao, and 964 pages from Sougou). Then we do semantic  TABLE I.

So the visible semantic network graph based on Shanghai e- government is formed as below in Fig 2.

After analyzing on Fig 2, we come to the following     Figure 2.  Semantic Network Graph based on Shanghai E-government  conclusions: first, since words like ?construction?, ?development?, ?impel? appear in high frequency, it is obviously that e-government is in the developing stage. It needs not only to improve the system technique to make it more automatic, but also to increase the scope and depth of its offering services. Second, the appearing of words like ?informationization? and ?security? indicates that the most important and hardest point of developing e-government is how to informatize the mass data and how to solve the security authentication problem. Third, e-government has become an effective way for governments to communicate with their citizens. The discussion and consultation in network communicating platforms improve governments? work efficiency, and they reflect one government?s image to some extent. Fourth, in order to improve efficiency, the standardization of e-government in different government departments is in great need for e-government development, which is beneficial to the sharing of information resources.

C. Analysis on Five Metropolis' E-governments based on Websites The empirical process is as follows: firstly, we use ROST  WebSpider to get the website data (altogether 2330 html web pages from level 1 to 3 ) of Beijing (http://www.beijing.gov.cn),Shanghai(http://www.shanghai.

gov.cn), Wuhan (http://www.wuhan.gov.cn), Guangzhou (http://www.guangzhou.gov.cn), and Chengdu (http://www.chengdu.gov.cn); secondly, with the help of ROST CM ? we do semantic analysis on the acquired webpage abstracts to extract the first 200 high-frequency words in semantic relationship, and then conclude the statistical table of word frequencies after removing the repeated words and efficient analyzing. At last, according to the semantic analysis on e-government, we construct the e- government evaluation model named SCISS which regards standardization (including specification, administration?), communication (including communicate, net fried?), informationization (including information, news, network?), service (including service, policy?) and security (including safe, guard, ensure?) degree as the main criterions[9- 10],The table shows in Table II.

STATISTICS OF KEY WORDS TABLE OF FIVE METROPOLIS' E-GOVERNMENT  Beijing Shang hai Wuhan Guang zhou  Cheng du  Standardiz ation 2680 3570 3485 2410 2125  Communi cation 2905 2790 2655 2820 1830  Informatiz ation 3030 3090 2910 2915 2480  Service 2755 3465 3320 2860 2740  Security 2170 2885 2480 1590 1215         From the table above, we conclude that compared with other metropolis, Shanghai e-government develops in a fast pace, especially in standardization and service. In the aspect of informationization, Shanghai e-government and Beijing e- government are outstanding, deserving to be used for reference by other metropolis. Enhancing e-government security is still an important task for five metropolis.

Communication is one of the key issues that should be developed in priority, where Beijing sets a good example for the other metropolis.



IV. CONCLUSION  The main work of this paper includes: We propose the new effective information extraction model which combines using meta-search engine and acquiring data in specific websites together and develop the content mining tool ROST Content Mining System after analyzing the research based on e-government home and abroad and mining on the information that both returned from search engines in width, and acquired in specific e-government websites in depth.

Then through the process of semantic mining on Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou, and Chengdu, we propose a simplified evaluation model SCISS to evaluate e-government websites, which will surely help to give suggestions and opinions to achieve the goal of making a more efficient and effective government. In the next step, we will analyze the existing data more deeply, and mine data in more e- government websites that have typical representativeness.

Also, we will monitor the acquired data set regularly in a dynamic way and conduct mining further on the real-time semantic network, and the ROST Content Mining System will be improved in a further way.
