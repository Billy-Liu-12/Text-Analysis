Research of Usability Test Mode Based on the Implicit User Behavior Lib

Abstract  Usability has been used to measure the core Competitive ability of domestic products. Since usability testing cannot be limited to the tradition manual testing method, a new usability research model of implicit collection ofuser behavior lib has invoked the interest of the big name corporations. Based on the slideshow dual screen notebook's auxiliary screen focus functionality development, usability principles and UCD method, extracting 31 usability collecting data points of implicit user behaviors, then transform the data into measurement of data collection, this article gives out data display algorithm ofuser behavior lib. It sets up the procedure of implicit mining user behavior lib. This method applies to the creation of implicit collection ofuser behavior lib used by usability testing.

Keywords: Usability Test, Data Mining, Implicit User Behavior Lib.

1. Introduction  Usability test is used to improve the usability of product in design process. The value of usability test is that the problems of tested product or service can be found early and improving advice can be given before the final decision of the product. It can help the developers improve their products entirely with small investment, so it can save the developing cost[1].

Now the mainly usability test method is providing certain operation scenes and setting a series of tasks aimed at target users that the users need to accomplish.

The operation scenes and tasks are highly related to the tested products or services. Through observation the testers can find the problems occurred during the mutual process of human and machine. They can also find function and operation fashion that users like or dislike and why. The testers can provide improving advice based on their observation and analysis.

Establishing implicit data user behavior lib is a development direction of usability test and is very different from current usability test procedure. The main idea is establishing an all-sided user behavior lib at the very beginning of design process and complementing   data of this lib during the developing process. Whenever there is some problem occurred during the developing process, the developers can check the original data of the lib to get some direct or indirect support for their design. Different from explicit feedback, acquiring implicit feedback will not interrupt user's mutual operation and user need not to pay additional cost.

Implicit feedback can be acquired easily and can be used large-scale and long-term acquiring. It provides important guarantee of the accuracy and reality of usability test.

This paper will acquire implicit feedback characters of user operation behavior aimed at focus function of certain product. The method implicit mining of user behavior was prompted through investigation of the relations between these characters and usability principles. It included the following research problems:  I) which implicit feedback characters were related to usability test according to focus function;  2) how to get the main characters ofusability implicit mining pattern from implicit feedback characters and summarize the optimal procedure system of implicit mining of user behavior in usability research domain using.

2. Establishment of users' behavior lib by implicit mining  Implicit data mining of user behavior (IMUB) is collection of a large amount of mutual data without users' awareness. It can provide the designers users' experience of using the product. Narrow IMUB is the data mining procedure aimed at target users. It forms a user behavior lib of target users through data acquiring, data mining and data display. Through the conformity of target users by IMUB, a user behavior lib that is very close to real users' experience can be established, see Figure.I. Though the research of typical model in the behavior lib and compare with the initial ideal users, the problems of user experience of the product can be validated and the first-hand improving advise can be acquired. More closer the target user model in final users' behavior lib is to the initial ideal user model, the better the usability of whole design is. So IMUB can be an evaluation method of user experience.

Figure 1. A simple procedure of establishing IMUB lib  3. Complement and modification of User- Center Design (UCD) of IMUB  From Fig.1 we can see IMUB can be divided into three steps: data acquiring, data mining and data display.

The emphasis of each step, detail of the procedure and method can be different according to different project.

From the point of data mining, the three steps are necessary.

During the determining of acquiring points of user behavior, testing points of some behaviors can be settled by experts' experience. The determination of these testing points is based the general knowledge of the behavior, showed in table I and table 2.

4.2. Acquiring points signing of implicit users' behavior lib  Usability means the product is effectiveness, learnability, efficiency, memorability, error tolerance and satisfaction to users. It means whether the user can accomplish his task with the product, what is his efficiency and whether he feels satisfied or not. Here we investigated two focus functions and established implicit behavior mining point of usability test according to evaluation usability principles.

A.The switch of application windows between main screen and secondary screen  The secondary screen is used to display some information that the users do not want to display on main screen and protect their privacy.

Implement scheme: hide window on main screen7display the window come from the main screen on secondary screen7user make a pushing upward gesture on secondary screen and the window come back to main screen.

B.Timing update of information on secondary screen cut from main screen  The secondary screen is a temporary display device.

It displays and updates the information users need to concern in real time.

Implement scheme: select part area users want to display in main screen frame7display the selected area on secondary screen7 update the information of secondary screen automatically 7 user make a pushing upward gesture on secondary screen and the window come back to main screen.

4.1. Filtering of focus functions and interactive design  After establishing a procedure construction of implicit mining user behavior lib, a real project is needed to validate its correction and application. The IMUB procedure adopted by Project Sideshow (a method switching the mutual focus between main screen and secondary screen of notebook computer) included the following stages: prototype design stage, prepare of data acquiring stage, data mining and display stage and UCD complement stage.

4. Example of implicit user behavior lib Target UserIdeal User  The technique of data mining is necessary base during the procedure of IMUB. Usability principle of user experience is key to framing implicit mining project of user behavior theoretically. This can be validated from three facets.

First, to transfer ideal user into target user, usability principle and focus function of user experience will be used to filter users and even the setting of every target point, the meaning of indicators used to guide data acquiring and the design and development of the third party software.

Second, at the stage of data prepare, some core data direction principles concerned by the designers mostly can be formulated according to the design procedure of usability and the current situation of the whole project.

They can be used to regulate data integration, data selection and data pretreatment and even form the core treatment guidelines in data prepare stage. For example, during data acquiring of system construction alternation data prepare guidelines as common attention are a~ follow: I) focus of functions, 2) curve of typical behaviors, 3) time point of iteration, 4) amount of resource consuming. These factors are related to each other and indivisible. They form the principles of critical data acquiring[2].

Third, the implicit data mining process of IMUB can be seen as implicit user behavior mining process based on usability design. The guideline of each step should obey the idea of User-Center Design during DM (data mining) procedure. The summary report can recover the mutual process between user and system maximally with accomplishment of mining process,. But in actual instance, the potential influence factors of user behavioral decision are very complex (such as environment factor, sensibility factor and psychology factor) and there must be some factors that IMUB cannot acquire. So the common mainstream user test method would be used in the final stage of the procedure to accomplish the final usability report, such as questionnaire, focus group discussions and one to one     But most of such usability problems lists cannot be used as acquiring indicators for developing data acquiring software. They should be translated into scalar names of data acquiring and the scalar names should be compatible with the conceptual names of technique personnel. The translation result is shown as table 3.

Table 3 List of usability problems and translated scalar names  Table 1 List of usability problem of focus function A  Focus function A Mutual step No. Usability problem Generate demand 1 Whether switch window is necessary of target window when notebook computer is used hiding normally  2 While there exists hiding demand, can it be solve by minimizing the window  ObservabiIity of 3 Whether the switch button at left-up window switch comer can be observed easily button 4 The visual metaphor of icon is definite  or not Click the switch 5 Response speed is fast enough or not button  6 The response of button is definite or not  7 The chance of error operation Switch the window 8 The switch speed of main screen to to secondary screen secondary screen is faster and the  speed of secondary screen to main screen is slower  9 There is deflection while touching secondary screen.

The result would be provided to the developers of third party software as function development guidelines of implicit mining software.

Display users' behavior database  Usability problems are translated into corresponding data acquiring scalar in the table so that technique personnel can edit third party software without obstacles.

And plugs of implicit acquiring data can acquire focus data concerned by designers. And accurate guidelines for usability evaluation of mutual systems would be generated.

Implicit database could have all the data element of usability observing points after data acquiring. How to locate the usability problems need to be checked and investigated in the database is related to the display of data. Procedure statistic display method was adopted in this project. Procedure simulator was established at the same time the user behavior lib was formed[3]. Related data element would be display synchronous while researcher operated mutually in simulated environment.

The display of data element in Sideshow implicit behavior lib mainly depended on the alternative running  5. Conclusion  (1)R=~ Iffy/xiv T n.
