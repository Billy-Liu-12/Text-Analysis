Information Governance, Big Data   and Data Quality

Abstract- the value of information as a competitive differential has been taken into consideration in companies all over the world for some time already. In recent years, there has been heated debate about some terms originated from new concepts related to information, such as big data, due to the promise that such topic might revolutionise world trade. Hence, data and information governance and quality have been increasingly discussed in the business world.

Keywords-Information Governance, Big Data, Data Quality.



I.  INTRODUCTION  While Information Technology (IT) offers technological and computing resources aiming at information generation, information systems suggest changes in the businesses' processes, structure and strategy. Companies that seek ways to remain competitive use these tools, as they create opportunities for managers to improve their vision of the future within organisations. An example of this is the increasing number of analytical projects that have been institutionalised.

Big data is a new term, used to describe the great volume of information that is originated from various channels, such as companies' traditional systems, the Internet,  and the social networks, among others, and use this information to analyze and understand people's behaviour.

The journal Harvard Business Review [1] has recently published an article about how big data is revolutionising the management of companies. In that issue, it was presented a study conducted with the MIT Center for Digital Business team, where 330 North American companies had been researched regarding their practices of organizational management and technology. The objective of that study was to test the hypothesis that data-driven businesses have a better performance. The result showed that in all the analyses made, the more the company was characterized as data-driven, the better was its result in objective financial and operating performance indicators.

However, despite all efforts and investment in technology, many problems related to data quality and trustworthiness were identified by the companies' departments, exactly at the moment of analytical projects implantation, which compromises the deadlines established and the investments made. It is possible to illustrate the following problems:   DOI 10.1109/CSE.2013.168    DOI 10.1109/CSE.2013.168     ? Great efforts to prepare data originated from legacy systems to be made available in the analytical environment;  ? Lack of unicity in the corporative visions and lack of clients' unique vision;  ? Necessity of revision and definition of policies for treatment of great volumes of data and for information lifecycle management (ILM);  ? Absence of efficient tools to guarantee data quality.



II. RELEVANT CONCEPTUALIZATIONS   In the vision of [2], ?data are defined as isolated facts devoid of meaning. Information is defined as processed data that has meaning because of relationships established with other data.?  In his book, ?Business @ the Speed of Thought?, Bill Gates stated that "how you gather, manage, and use information will determine whether you win or lose". He also stated that the success of companies depends on other equally important factors and he talks about the emerging of a new role, approaching aspects that can be related to information governance: ?now you can be a business thinker. You have numbers to help you run your business? [3]. ?In the new economy, information is in digital format: bits.? [4]. In the age of big data, it is natural that this subject becomes discussed in depth.

According to [5], ?Information governance is a program that aims to orchestrate people, processes and technology so as to identify roles and responsibilities regarding a company's critical data inventory and, at the same time, to confer the required quality.? The amplitude of this concept allows us to go beyond data operationalisation, as it focuses on data quality.

For this to be possible, other components are inserted in this scene, such as people and processes.

In the book "Information Quality Applied", [6] presents an extensive list of companies and ?the high costs of poor quality information systems software and databases?, due to different reasons. For example: software errors, fails on customer relationship management system, administrative processing system cancelled, maintenance repair systems, among others.

Perhaps these are strong arguments to justify that the focus of information governance is on data quality.



III. INTERDEPENDENCE OF CONCEPTS For the establishment of information governance, it is  suggested the involvement of people (IT staff and the business staff), processes (IT?s and business?), and technology to improve the organisation's data quality. And when one talks about business intelligence and business analytics, the focus is on data quality to generate trustworthy information.

In December 2012, [7]  published an article that showed the sophistication used in Barack Obama's re-election campaign, which congregated new technologies, data scientists and  specialists in the field to frame and categorize a great volume (180 Terabyte) of data from voters, so as to guide decisions and to raise funds during the presidential campaign. According to the article, this fact represents an innovation, and big data technology is also an innovation.

Part of the success of the example aforementioned also lies in the use of other sources of enriched data, that is, qualified data. Hence, the necessity of having thorough information surpasses the analytical world and goes towards the transactional, where processes, methodologies and tools have to be concerned with questions like ?how, when and by whom? the data will be consumed, and ?for how long?. This set of facets related to data treatment is what is called information governance.



IV. CONCLUSION   The discussion about the topic of ?information governance" is relatively new, and it is still little explored and shared in companies. Perhaps because necessity emerges when associated to business intelligence, in most of the cases.

Therefore, when we analyze the connection of this concept with the processes adopted to confer an adequate treatment to an organisation's critical data, we notice the importance of this discipline.

It is natural that new terms emerge, following technological  trends, businesses' needs, and changes in the behaviour of the system's users and clients. One example of this is big data.

Consequently, the companies' new expectations in relation to the use of data can be translated in the following way: with information governance and applicability of big data, it is possible to make better projections and to make more intelligent decisions.
