Determinants of Personal Well-Being in Urban China

Abstract?The study investigates the relationship between environmental satisfaction and personal well-being with a sample of 336 urban residences from 4 Chinese cities: Changchun, Dalian, Harbin and Shenyang. In contrast to previous studies, this study controlled job satisfaction and Big Five personality traits. In addition, the research variables of PWI, job satisfaction, Big Five, and environmental satisfaction are measured with multi-item scales. The research finds that environmental satisfaction is positively related to personal well-being, suggesting that improvement of environment can enhance urban residents? well-being.

I.  INTRODUCTION There is an increasing interest in the study of determinants  of people?s well-being [e.g. 1]. Recently, researchers have been concerned about the impact of natural environment on well- being [2,3]. However, there is a lack of study on environmental satisfaction and people?s well-being. With China?s rapid economic development, environment problems have become an important issue in China. For instance, according to world Bank, China has 16 of the 20 most polluted cities in the world [4]. It is imperative to investigate the impact of natural environment on people?s lives.

This study will examine the relationship between satisfaction with environment and personal well-being in four Chinese cities: Changchun, Dalian, Harbin and Shenyang. The current study makes three contributions to the literature on the determinants of personal well-being. First, it adds to the scant literature on the determinants of personal well-being, especially on the environmental determinants. Second, the study use multi-item scales to measure the studied variables. Multi-item scale is of better quality than single item scales. Third, in this study, personality was controlled, so it can give a more complete picture of the determinants of well-being.



II. THE MODEL AND HYPOTHESES The model and hypothesized relationship between the  variables is shown in Fig. 1.

Figure 1.  Hypothesized relationship among the variables  Personal well-being is often used interchangeably with life satisfaction [5]. Life satisfaction refers the evaluations of one?s life according to subjectively determined standards [6].

Environmental satisfaction is defined as people?s attitude towards the natural environment, such as air quality, solid waste treatment, parkland, control on water pollution and noisy control. Theories suggest that environmental quality can influence people?s personal well-being through both environmental good and environmental bads. According to MacKerron and Mourato [7], environmental goods such as parkland can affect people?s personal well-being via people?s interaction with nature and other people. On the other hand, environmental bads such as air pollution can affect people?s personal well-being via its negative effect of people?s health [7]. Empirical studies in China have found that atmospheric pollution and parkland are related to people?s personal well- being [2]. Therefore, the following hypothesis is proposed on the relationship between environmental satisfaction and personal well-being.

According to the spillover theory, job experiences spill over into other spheres of life, and vice versa, suggesting a positive relationship between job and life satisfaction. Empirical studies have found support for the positive relationship between job and life satisfaction [9].

Therefore, the following hypothesis is proposed on the relationship between job satisfaction and personal well-being.

Hypothesis 2: Job satisfaction will be positively related to personal well-being  Extraversion consists of sociability, dominance, ambition, positive emotionality, and excitement-seeking [10].

Extraversion is expected to be positively related to personal well-being for several reasons. First, as individuals high in extraversion tends to experience positive emotions, which may lead to high personal well-being. Second, individuals high in extraversion engage in more social activities, which may lead to high personal well-being. Meta-analysis [11] has reported a positive relationship between extraversion and life satisfaction.

Therefore, the following hypothesis is proposed on the relationship between extraversion and personal well-being.

Hypothesis3: Extraversion will be positively related to personal well-being  Neuroticism is also called emotional stability or emotional resilience, which is the opposite of neuroticism [10]. As individuals high in neuroticism tends to experience negative affectivity, they are likely to report low personal well-being.

Meta-analysis [11] has found a negative relationship between neuroticism and life satisfaction. Therefore, the following hypothesis is proposed on the relationship between neuroticism and personal well-being.

Hypothesis4: Neuroticism will be negatively related to personal well-being  Conscientiousness consists of dependability, achievement striving and planfulness [10]. As individuals high in conscientiousness are more likely to be successful in their work and life, they are expected to have higher personal well-being.

Meta-analysis [11] has found a positive relationship between conscientiousness and life satisfaction. Therefore, the following hypothesis is proposed on the relationship between conscientiousness and personal well-being.

Hypothesis5: Conscientiousness will be positively related to personal well-being  As the other two factors in the Big Five personality traits (agreeableness and openness to experience) are correlated with the above-mentioned three personality factors, they will be controlled in the data analysis. In addition, as the possible influence of gender, age, marital status, educational level, managerial position, ownership of respondents? organization, and pay level on well-being, these variables are also controlled in the data analysis.



III. THE METHOD  The sample and procedure A convenience sampling method was used to collect data.

Data was collected from four cities in the Northeast: Changchun, Dalian, Harbin and Shenyang in 2009. The sample covered a wide range of industry groups, including manufacturing, health services, education, and government branches. The number of completed survey was 356. Among them, 20 were deemed as unable because of too many missing data, leaving 336 valid cases. The effective response rate is 94.4 per cent. The characteristics of the participants are reported in Table 1.

TABLE I.   PROFILE OF THE RESPONDENTS  Variables  N % Gender  Male  197 58.6 Female  139 41.4  Age (years) <25 98 29.2 26-30 146 43.5 31-35 35 10.4 36-40 14 4.2 41-45 11 3.3 46-50 16 4.8 51-55 12 3.6 56-60 4 1.0  Marital status Single 187 55.8 Married 149 44.2  Education Junior secondary 11 3.3 Senior secondary 23 6.8 Polytechnic 53 15.8 Bachelor 215 64.0 Master 30 8.9 PHD 4 1.2  Income RMB <500 9 2.7 501-1000 20 6.0 1001-1500 60 17.9 1501-2000 67 19.9 2001-2500 43 12.8 2501-3000 38 11.3 3001-3500 25 7.4 3501-4000 25 7.4 4001-4500 15 4.5 4501-5000 4 1.2 Over 5000 30 8.9  Position Ordinary employee 243 72.2 Cadre  93 27.8  Ownership Non-state sector 176 52.3 State sector 160 47.7    Table 1 indicates that the proportion of men is a little higher than women. About 83% of the respondents are under age 35. Over half of the respondents are single. The sample was relatively well-educated, with 74.1 % with four years higher education or more. The majority of the respondents earned 1000 to 3000 RMB per month. A quarter of them are managers and about half of them from state sector.

Survey instrument Personal Well-being is measured with personal well-being  index (PWI) [12]. Job satisfaction was measured with the scale developed by Tsui, Egan and O?Reilly [13]. The Big Five factor personality traits was measured with Big Five Index (BFI) [14]. All these scales have been used in various previous studies and proved to have good psychometric property.

Environmental satisfaction was measured with a new scale, which include six items. The first five items are about satisfaction with air quality, solid waste treatment, parks, waste water treatment and noise control, and the sixth is about satisfaction with environment in general. The summation of the first five items is used as the score for environmental satisfaction. All the items are in 5-Likert scale. There is a Chinese version of PWI [12]. The scale of job satisfaction and the BFI are in English. Translation and back translation was used for these two scales. One of the researchers translated the original English version into Chinese and subsequently back translated by a second bilingual speaker. The back-translation and the original were compared, and discrepancies between those two versions were resolved through discussion between translators to ensure equivalence of both Chinese and English versions.

Data Analysis Method Internal consistency alpha was calculated to determine the  reliability of the scales. Multivariate regression was used to assess the effect of these variables on personal well-being.



IV. RESULTS Before multivariate analysis of the data, Cronbach alpha is  calculated to assess the internal consistency alphas of the multivariate scales. The results are presented in Tab. 2. The alphas range from 0.68 to 0.85, which are close to or above the hurdle of 0.70 for social science research [15]. Therefore, they can be subjected to further research.

TABLE II.   RELIABILITY OF THE SCALES  Variables Number of items  Alpha  Job satisfaction 5 0.64 Environmental satisfaction 5 0.84 PWI 8 0.85 Extraversion 8 0.75 Agreeableness 9 0.71 Conscientiousness 9 0.79 Neuroticism 8 0.68 Openness to experience 10 0.77    In addition, assumptions for linear regression were tested before regression analysis. The assumptions include missing values, outliers, normality of dependent variable, multilinearity and linearity for the relationship between dependent and independent variables [16]. There were less than 5% missing data. No univariate outliers were present in the continuous data.

Normality of the dependent variables was confirmed through skewness and Kurtosis indices. All the data demonstrated acceptable linearity. The regression results are displayed in table 3.

TABLE III.   REGRESSION RESULTS PREDICTING PWI  variables Beta Job satisfaction 0.201 ** Environmental satisfaction 0.100 * Conscientiousness 0.234 ** Extraversion 0.155 * Neuroticism -0.033 Agreeableness -0.045 Openness to experience 0.009 State sector 0.249 ** Manager 0.165 ** Married 0.121 * Female -0.059 Age -0.066 Educational level -0.057 Pay level -0.012 R2 0.342  * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.001 (2-tailed)    The regression results demonstrate that the model can explain 34.2% of the variance in PWI. The research found that individuals high in job satisfaction, environmental satisfaction, extraversion, conscientiousness, married, managers, and working in state-sector are happier with their life. So hypotheses on the relationship between these PWI and the four variables are supported: job satisfaction, environmental satisfaction, conscientiousness and extraversion. However, the research found a non-significant relationship between PWI and neuroticism, agreeableness, openness to experience, gender, age, educational level, and pay level, so hypothesis on the relationship between PWI and neuroticism is not supported.



V. DISCUSSION The research found that conscientiousness has the largest  effect on well-being. This finding is consistent with previous studies [11]. The explanation for this finding may be that individuals high in conscientiousness are more successful in their careers, and live a higher living standard and be happier with their life.

Job satisfaction has the second largest effect on well-being.

The finding of a positive relationship between job satisfaction and well-being is consistent with previous study and support the spillover theory on the relationship between job and well- being [6]. The finding indicates that people?s positive attitude in work may spillover to life or vice versa.

Environmental satisfaction has the third largest impact on well-being. The finding of a positive relationship between satisfaction with environment and well-being is congruent with previous studies in China [2, 3]. The finding suggests that improvement of the natural surroundings in the cities can improve people?s well-being. As this study controlled variables such as personality and pay level, the finding on the positive relationship between satisfaction and well-being is more convincing. The research suggests that the authorities should put more emphases on the natural environment in order to increase people?s well-being.
