A General Framework for Fuzzy Data Mining

Abstract? Mining association rules is one of the most important tasks in data mining. Several approaches generalizing association rules to fuzzy association rules have been proposed. In this paper we present a general framwork for mining fuzzy association rule.

Based on apriori algorithm, a new algorithm for mining fuzzy association rules is proposed. Experimental results illustrate the algorithm is more effective.

I.  INTRODUCTION For its successful applications in business areas recent years,  association rule mining [1] has become a key research project of data mining. Some of them focus on developing faster algorithms; another direction is to define rules that modify some conditions of the classical rules, such as weak ratio rule [2], fuzzy association rule [3] [4] etc. The basic idea of association rules is to identify frequent itemsets. Usually, an association rule works with a database D containing records described by binary attributes values.

An association rule is an expression having the following form, where A and B are attributes or sets of attribute. The meaning of an association rule is that when A is bought in transaction x., B is likely to be bought as well. Association rule can be divided into boolean association rules and quantitative association rules according to the data or attributes of the rules.

Many studies have focused on boolean association rules mining, such as Apriori, AprioriTID and DHP etc. However, many databases often contain quantitative attributes in real life, it is important to handle quantitative data mining. The first step of quantitative association rule mining is to discrete attributes.

Traditional methods such as interval partition method may not be in conformity with the distribution of data. To deal with the problem of sharp boundary in quantitative association rule mining, researchers have introduced fuzzy set theory to data mining. Such kind of association rule is called fuzzy association rule. Using fuzzy set concept the discovered rules are more understandable to humans. However, there are some problems in mining algorithm, including unreasonable support measure and subjectively determining membership function.

The paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we will present basic notions related to the fuzzy association rules, Section III presents algorithm for mining Fuzzy association rules, experiment is provided in section IV, and in the last  section a brief conclusion is given.



II. PRELIMINARY CONCEPTS To facilitate the discussion, the paper gives the related  concepts of fuzzy association rules firstly.

Let },,,{ 21 ntttD ?=  characterized by a set  1 2{ , , , }mI I I I= of attributes. For each attribute (1 )jI j m? ? ,  there is a corresponding fuzzy set 1 2{ , , , }jqj j ji i i , each element in interval ]1,0[ . A fuzzy association rule is of the form A?B, where A fI? , fB I? , and A B? = ? .Within the rule A?B, A is called the antecedent while B is called the consequent of the rule.

Definition 1 A t-norm is a commutative, associative and non-decreasing function, 2: [0,1] [0,1]T ? with the following property ( ,1)T x x=  for all x in[0,1] .

Definition 2 Let fuzzy itemset 1{ ,X x= 2 , , }mx x  fI? , the support of X on ith record is  ( ) ( ) ( )  1 1   , , ,  , , ( )  0                  ,   , ,      i i pi i pi  T  i pi  T x x T x x a ms Sup X  T x x a ms  ? ? ??= ? < ???

Formula 1 is the form of support degree when Ds  equal to a? ms in paper [3] .

Definition 4 the support degree of fuzzy association rules is defined as  ( )( )Sup X Y Sup X Y? = ? .                         (3) This work was supported by Foundation of He Nan Educational Committee  (2010B520027), Youth Foundation of Xuchang University (2010143).

III. FUZZY ASSOCIATION RULE MINING ALGORITHM Many papers have been devoted to develop algorithms to  mine fuzzy association rules. Most of them are an extension of apriori algorithm. The process of fuzzy association rule mining is divided into two phases. In the first step, frequent fuzzy 1- item sets L1 are generated by scanning the database. By joining L1 to itself, we can get candidate fuzzy itemsets C2. According to apriori principle C2 was pruned to form L2, accordingly, generate L3, ..., Lk. The algorithm for generating fuzzy association rules from frequent fuzzy itemsets is similar to that for mining Boolean association rules.

Algorithm: GFFP(Generate Frequent Fuzzy Pattern)  Input: D, membership function, ms  Output: frequent fuzzy itemsets  Method:  ?1? 1L  = { frequent 1 fuzzy term sets }  ?2?    for (k = 2? 1kL ? ? ? ?k++) do {  ?3?          kC  = apriori_gen ( 1kL ? ?ms)  ?4?          for each id D?  do {  ?5?              for each candidate kc C?  do  ?6?              sup = ( ) id  Sup c  ?7?             c.sup = c.sup + sup  ?8?         }  ?9?      kL  = { }| .supkc C c ms? ? ?10?     }  ?11? L = kk L? In the course of generating L1, there are two methods to  select the fuzzy itemsets:  (1). According to the principle of maximum membership value, only take the maximum degree of membership of fuzzy item [4] into L1. This method reduces the computational work, but it will lose some useful information.

(2). The fuzzy item are incorporated into L1 when the support of fuzzy item larger than or equal given ms. In this case, the follow-up calculation is more than the first methods, but can effectively reduce the amount of lost information .



IV. EXPERIMENT This section provides the empirical study of proposed  model on the heart disease dataset from UCI machine learning repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/).Experiment hardware environment:Intel Pentium4 2.4 GHz CPU, 512MB of memory; operating system: Windows XP Professional; programming environment: Visual C++ 6.0. We define 3 fuzzy set on each attribute, high, medium and low. We adopt the method proposed in paper [4] to determine the membership function.

And analyze the impact of various factors on mining result.

A. Adjusting  factor a Fig.1 and 2, respectively, show the relationship between ms  and the number of frequent fuzzy itemset when a = 0, a = 1, a = 2, and ms in [0.09, 0.2]. Fig.1 shows that the number of frequent fuzzy itemset gradually decreases with the ms increasining. The number of frequent itemsets generated when a = 0 is less than the number of frequent itemset generated when a = 1, however, the difference is minor. When ms = 0.19, a = 0, the number of frequent fuzzy itemsets is 339, while a = 1, the number of fuzzy itemsets is 323, and the difference is 16.

When a=2, it is illustrated that the number of frequent itemsets degrease by a wide margin. Accordingly, the running time degreases sharply.

Fig.1 shows that running time of generating frequent fuzzy itemsets degreases while ms and a increasing. a = 0, the single record of support threshold equal to 0. While a = 1, the support restrictions is strengthened in the model. not only requires the sum support of fuzzy itemset on whole database larger than or   Figure1 ms VS frequent itemset    Figure2 ms VS running time          8 10 12 14 16 18 20ms(%)  No .o  f fr  eq ue  nt it  em  a=2 a=1 a=0          8 10 12 14 16 18 20  ms(%)  ru n  ti me  (s ec  )  a=2 a=1 a=0     Figure3 t-norm VS frequent itemset     Figure4 t-norm VS time  equal to ms, but also requires the support of fuzzy itemset on each record must be greater than or equal to ms. a = 2, the restriction is strengthened further,  The support threshold on each record becomes 2*ms. Fig.1 and Fig.2 show the situation.

B. T-norm?s impact on the mining results We examined the realationships between the numeber of  fuzyy association rules and ms when using different t-norm operators in Fig.3. Min, product and bounded product are used.

When we use min operator, the number of frequent itemsets generated is larger than the number of frequent itemsets when using product operator and bounded producted operator. In Fig.4, the ms varies from 0.07 to 0.17, the run time of generating frequent itemset is from 14.9 seconds to 0.2 seconds.

We can see that with the run time decreases with an increase of ms.



V. CONCLUSIONS The traditional association rule mining algorithm is limited  to dealing with non-symmetric binary attribute and discrete attributes. Mining fuzzy association rules is a useful technique to find patterns in data in the presence of imprecision. The proposed model can be employed in mining distinct types of patterns.

In the future, we plan to conduct our experiments on other form s of data such as the web data to analyze the behavior of users to optimize the structure of web site.
