Analysis of Privacy-Preserving Mechanisms for Outsourcing Data Mining Tasks

Abstract?Many organizations have to outsource some of their data mining tasks due to inadequate in-house IT expertise. During this process, the organizations lose full security control of their source data which may lead to the exposure of their business privacy. In this paper, we first present different application scenarios of outsourcing computing tasks of data mining, then identify the elements that may expose privacy with a focus on why, how and when these element may expose privacy.

We also discuss the properties of promising solutions that can protect these elements thereby preserving privacy in outsourcing scenarios.

I. Introduction  The proliferation of information systems and technology has made business computing an indispensable part of certain business operations and a key to success for orga- nizations. As a part of the daily business computing, data collection is becoming ubiquitous, and every transaction is recorded somewhere [20]. Consequently, companies have accumulated huge amount of data from transactional and operational systems, which can be in the order of terabytes or even petabytes. With these data on hand, it is impor- tant to process them using certain data analysis techniques and make the results available for decision making.

Data mining, as one of the IT services most needed by organizations, has been recognized as an important approach for discovering knowledge from the collected or accumulated huge amount of raw data hence converting ?data rich? to ?knowledge rich?. The techniques of data mining have been widely used by organizations for as- sisting strategic decision making; and the benefits have been demonstrated in various industries and governmental sectors, e.g., banking, insurance, direct-mail marketing, telecommunications, retails, taxation, and health care [4, 8, 14].

Amongst all the available data mining methods, the discovery of associations between business events or trans- actions is one of the most commonly used data mining techniques. Association rule mining, also known as market basket analysis [2, 7], is the process of exploration and analysis upon raw data to discover new and meaningful  patterns in daily business operations [10, 19]. It has been widely applied to decision support and market strategy [11] for an organization.

A. Outsourcing Data Mining Tasks  To extract useful business information from these huge amounts of data with techniques such as association rule mining, the following IT expertise and facilities are es- sential: (1) software tools, such as efficient data mining algorithms; (2) hardware infrastructures, such as powerful computing facilities; and (3) human resources, such as data analysts and IT specialists.

However, not all organizations possess the above en- abling resources to carry out data mining by themselves.

This is because in today?s fast-paced business environ- ment, it is neither necessary nor possible for every or- ganization to understand, develop, and implement every information technology needed. Specialised IT services providers equipped with all the expertise and facilities have emerged to fill the business need. They provide different IT services at lower costs as per requirements for their customers. Naturally many organizations that are seeking IT services would consider outsourcing their data analysis tasks to the IT services providers.

In current globalized environment, there are some coun- tries where labor costs are much lower and IT expertise and skills are abundant. There is a trend of growing off- shore outsourcing (offshoring) by shifting IT jobs to such countries. This trend also indicates that IT outsourcing has become a market-proven cost-efficient model, and is changing the landscape of the IT service industry.

B. Privacy Concern in Outsourcing Practice  Notwithstanding the benefits of outsourcing IT services, some organizations still hesitate to outsource their data mining tasks due to the concern of privacy exposure. This is because when an organization hands over its source database to an external party, its data privacy is under the custody of the external party which may not be fully trustworthy. Although it is possible to sign up a non- disclosure agreement between them as a legal protection,     it is technically difficult to prevent intentional or uninten- tional disclosure of source databases by certain staff, or prevent hackers from stealing the source database [13].

A possible solution to deal with this situation is pre- processing the source databases with some kind of masking technique before handing them over to external IT services providers, so that the source databases retain the original association information whilst the privacy contained in the data can be well preserved. With the pre-processed source databases, all external parties, such as IT services providers or hackers, are supposedly unable to easily reveal the private information from the databases.

C. Objectives of this Study  Whilst privacy preserving in data mining has been an active research area since 1990s and various algorithms have been proposed (see e.g., [1, 3, 9]), privacy preserving in outsourcing scenarios is a new direction recently intro- duced by Qiu et al. [16, 18]. In this paper, we aim to further investigate why, how and when of privacy preserving in outsourcing data mining tasks.

The main objectives of this study include the following: (1) discussing different application scenarios of outsourc- ing data mining tasks; (2) investigating the elements that can expose data privacy in outsourcing practice; (3) study- ing the mechanism of privacy preserving, i.e., why, how, and when privacy can be exposed via those elements; (4) analyzing the properties of successful solutions and suggesting promising solutions to preserve privacy while outsourcing data mining tasks; and (5) enhancing the awareness of potential privacy exposure in outsourcing practice.

Corresponding to the above objectives, the remaining sections of this paper are organized as follows. We first present the application scenarios of outsourcing practice, and then identify the elements that can expose data pri- vacy. Next we analyze the preferred properties of solutions and lastly conclude the paper with suggestion of promising solutions.



II. Related Work  The traditional techniques for privacy preserving in data mining can be classified into two major types, namely data perturbation and secure multi-party computation (see [5, 20] for reviews of existing algorithms). With data perturbation methods [3, 9], the raw data are modified by randomization or by adding noise so that they no longer represent the real values, whilst preserving the statistical property of the raw data. With secure multi- party computation methods [1, 12, 15], multiple parties, which normally work in a distributed computing environ- ment, participate in a protocol to share their own pieces of private data and cooperate to get the final results.

However, these methods do not work well in outsourcing scenarios.

Recently a Bloom filter [6] based solution has been proposed for privacy preserving in outsourcing scenarios [16?18]. With this method, the source data are firstly converted to Bloom filter representations before handing over to an external party (which could be an IT services provider). The external party carries out the data mining tasks upon receiving the requests from the client that outsources it tasks, and returns the mining results to the first party upon completing data mining computations. In this mining process, all three elements, i.e., the source data, the mining requests, and the mining results, are represented in Bloom filters. The data privacy is thus preserved by Bloom filters, which can be recognized as an irreversible coding scheme given that the keys are kept secret to the external party.



III. Application Scenarios of Outsourcing  Let us consider a typical application scenario as follows.

In an organization, such as an enterprise or a governmental department, there are usually some functional divisions, e.g., a human resources division and a finance division.

Amongst these divisions, there is an IT division which provides in-house IT services to other divisions in the organization. It is very natural that a functional division has to outsource its computing tasks to the IT division due to the following two reasons: (1) lack of IT expertise and (2) lack of powerful computing facilities. This is because in an organization IT specialists and powerful computing resources are normally centrally managed by the IT division so as to optimize the usage of computing resources. It is neither necessary nor possible to equip every division with powerful computing facilities and IT specialists.

The above scenario can be extended to a more general circumstance where all divisions in an organization can be viewed as individually independent organizations or enterprises, with those organizations that seek external IT services analogous to the functional divisions, and those organizations that provide IT services and undertake outsourced computing tasks analogous to the IT division.

The scenario is also applicable to an online model with a client-server-based computing architecture (see [17] for a detailed description of this architecture). In this online model, the centre data server is analogous to a functional division. It collects computing requests from client servers, and outsources partial computing tasks to edge servers that play the roles as IT divisions.

In remaining of this paper, without further specification, we always refer to the first party as an organization or division that outsources its computing tasks, and the second party as an IT services provider that undertake outsourced computing tasks from the first party.



IV. Elements Exposing Privacy in Outsourcing  Given the aforementioned application scenarios, a com- plete process of outsourcing data mining tasks consists of the following repeating steps.

Step 1, a first party hands over the source database to a second party.

Step 2, the first party sends mining requests to the second party.

Step 3, the second party carries out the computing tasks of data mining with the source database and mining requests, and returns the mining results to the first party upon completion of all computing tasks. Goto Step 2.

In the above mining process, there are three elements that may expose data privacy of the first party. In an inter-organizational scenario, it may lead to a disadvanta- geous situation in business competition once the privacy of an organization is exposed to unauthorized parties such as its business rivals. On the other hand, in an intra-organizational scenario, a functional division of an organization (such as a governmental department) may possess some information and data that are confidential to other divisions. Therefore it is critical to take privacy- preserving measures during the outsourcing process.

The first element that may expose privacy is the source database. The source database for data mining normally includes the transactions and business events of the first party in a given period of time. An unauthorized party can easily access the business information contained in the raw data, and furthermore, with the source database, perform data mining tasks to reveal hidden and sensitive information.

The second element is the mining requests. Mining requests are normally the candidates of some patterns that are of interests to the first party. For example, for association rule mining, the mining requests from the first party can be the candidates of frequent itemsets.

These candidates, which are part of all potential patterns, reveal the first party?s interests and foci based on which corresponding business strategies and decisions could be made. Therefore, these mining requests actually imply some potential actions the first party will be taking.

The third element is the mining results. Mining results are the revealed private information previously hidden amongst the huge amount of raw data in the source database. They are the basis on which the strategic policies and decisions are made by an organization.

Therefore, to preserve data privacy of the first party in this outsourcing process, all three elements should be well protected simultaneously.



V. Solutions  A. Traditional Techniques  Some traditional techniques for privacy preserving, such as perturbation based methods [3, 9], can prevent unau- thorized parties from deciphering the contents of the source database; however, the mining requests and results are still represented in a plain-text format under these methods, making them vulnerable to privacy breaches from unauthorized parties.

Methods based on secure multi-party computation [1, 12, 15] work under a distributed computing environment with each party sharing part of the data. This technique cannot prevent multi-party attack because, by collecting pieces of source data from multiple parties, an adversary can easily access and identify sensitive information from the collected pieces of data.

Given the limitation of traditional methods, to preserve privacy which may be exposed by any of three elements mentioned above, an intuitive solution is to encrypt all three elements. For example, we can first convert the data format with certain encoding or encryption scheme such as DES, RSA, or other algorithms, and hand over the format- converted source database together with mining requests to a second party. This will not only prevent an unautho- rized party from deciphering the original meanings of these elements but also from accessing private information even if this unauthorized party obtained all or part of these data through some channel such as hackering. However, this may not work well in outsourcing for the following reasons:  First, the computational time for conversion. If the computational time for the format conversion of source data is greater than that for data mining, it would not be worthwhile for a first party to outsource computing tasks to a second party. The first party might as well run the data mining tasks by itself directly with the original data format. Given this understanding, while some crypto- graphical systems such as DES and RSA are strong enough against attack, they are not applicable to real outsourcing applications because the encryption mechanisms require large amount of computation for data format conversion.

Second, the size of converted database. As we mentioned in Section 1, the data sets collected and accumulated can consist of terabytes or even petabytes of data. If after format conversion, the data size is in the order of tens or hundreds times of the original size, then the encoding scheme may not be acceptable to real applications. This is because with the increased size of data, the computational time for data mining will increase proportionally. Again, for example, DES and RSA require huge amount of storage space in addition to computation time.

Third, the precision of mining results. If the data mining tasks are carried out based on encoded data formats, there is a concern of mining result precision. That is, whether some useful information is lost in the results or some false information is brought in together with the correct information. Perturbation-based methods can incur intro- duction of false information and lost of useful formation; the mining precision depends on how the original data are perturbed and how many percents of noises are added into the source data.

Fourth, the privacy preserving property. This is the ma- jor concern in outsourcing scenarios. With the converted formats of source data and mining requests, an intuitive question is in what data format the mining results will be     represented in the second party side before returning to the first party. If mining results are represented in plain- text format, then some privacy is definitely exposed to the second party. If in converted format, whether it is still possible for the second or an unauthorized party to reveal some private information based on statistical attack.

TABLE I A database of transactions  ID Items in a transaction plain text format encoded format  T1 {peach, apple} {1, 2} T2 {banana} {3} T3 {apple, banana, plum} {2, 3, 4} T4 {lemon} {5} T5 {peach, apple,plum, lemon, orange} {1, 2, 4, 5, 6}  Table I shows the contents of a database of transactions for a mini fruit supermarket as an example. The content of each transaction in the table is shown in plain text (the middle column) and encoded format (the right column) which may be obtained through DES, RSA, or other schemes. However, the encoded format is vulnerable to statistical attack. This is because the length of a transac- tion divulges how many items are contained. The shortest transactions (e.g., transactions T2 and T4) actually tell the information of some individual items. Coupled with known-text attack (a commonly used espionage approach by obtaining and comparing a piece of plain-text and the corresponding encrypted-text), the second party is able to decipher the corresponding relationships, such as that peach is represented by 1 and apple by 2, and eventually reach the private information.

B. Preferred Solutions  Given the above analysis, to preserve privacy that may be exposed by any of the three elements, a preferred solution should possess all of the following properties: (1) Time efficient. The time for encrypting or converting the format of source data should be neglectable comparing with the time required for data mining computations.

(2) Storage efficient. The storage space after data format conversion should be within 10 times of the original storage space. (3) High mining precisions. The mining precision should be high enough without losing useful information if extra useless information cannot be avoided. (4) Privacy preserving. The encoding scheme should be strong enough against statistical attack.

Recently, a Bloom filter-based approach has been pro- posed for privacy preserving whilst outsourcing computing tasks of association rule mining [16?18]. As a computa- tional and space efficient encoding scheme, a Bloom filter is a bit stream (or a bit vector) used to represent a set of objects [6]. The proposed approach can be a representative of a paradigm of preferred solutions by which all the above properties are satisfied.

First, it is time efficient. The relationship between the format conversion time and mining time is given as follows  Tc Tm  < 5%  where Tc is the time for converting source data from plain-text to Bloom filter presentations, and Tm the time required for one time of mining all association rules based on given thresholds of minimum support and confidence.

In real application, the mining may be carried out for many times with different thresholds of minimum support and confidence thereby achieving higher time efficiency.

Second, it is storage space efficient. The relationship between the storage requirements for both data formats is shown as follows  1.1 < Sc So  < 2.8  where Sc represents the storage requirement in Bloom filter representation, and So the storage requirement in original data formats which can be either ASCII or binary format.

Third, it achieves high mining precisions. The false negative rates are zero, and the overall false positive rates are lower than 2% as shown below:  Fp < 2%  where Fp is the false positive rate. In other words, this method does not lose any useful information while it may incur a few number of false association rules which can be easily identified and removed by post-processing.

TABLE II A database of transactions in Bloom filter format  ID Items in a transaction plain text format Bloom filter  T1 {peach, apple} 011001100100 T2 {banana} 010100010100 T3 {apple, banana, plum} 011100110100 T4 {lemon} 010101000000 T5 {peach, apple, plum, lemon, orange} 011101110100  Fourth, it is strong enough against statistical attack.

After data format conversion, all transactions are repre- sented in Bloom filters with the same length, such as 12 bits as shown in Table II. Given that the Bloom filter is such constructed that the probability of each bit being 1 or 0 is 0.5, it is impossible to tell the length of a transaction by computing the number of 1?s or 0?s from the Bloom filter [6, 18]. For a transaction containing a single item, the number of 1?s in its Bloom filter may be the same as that of a transaction containing a few items.

To enhance the security level, Qiu et al. presented how to insert secret keys into Bloom filters of transactions and mining requests and how to create and manage secret keys in real applications [17, 18].



VI. Conclusion  The major contributions of this paper include the fol- lowing: (1) we have discussed application scenarios of outsourcing data mining tasks; (2) we have identified the elements that may expose privacy, and analyzed why, how, and when these elements may expose data privacy; and (3) we have studied the properties of the preferred solu- tions for privacy preserving in the scenario of outsourcing computing tasks of association rule mining, and proposed a paradigm for such solutions.

For the next stage of study, an interesting direction is to investigate other privacy preserving solutions for out- sourcing scenarios based on the above paradigm, and study the robustness of the solutions against privacy attacks especially from a viewpoint of cryptography.
