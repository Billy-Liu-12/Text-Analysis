Abstract?Recently, incredible growth in communication tech- nology has given rise to the hot topic, Big Data. Distributed wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are the key provider of Big Data and can generate a significant amount of data. Various technical challenges exist in gathering the real time data. Energy efficient routing algorithms can overcome these challenges. The signal transmission features have been obtained by analyzing the experiments. According to these experiments, an energy efficient Big Data algorithm (BDEG) for WSN is proposed for real time data collection. Clustering communication is established on the basis of RSSI and residual energy of sensor nodes. Experimental simulations show that BDEG is stable in terms of network lifetime and data transmission time because of load balancing scheme. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified through numerical results obtained in MATLAB.

I. INTRODUCTION  Advanced technologies and research in the various fields of information technology (IT) has aided the growth in data volume, storage, filtration, handling etc. A large volume of data (Approx. 90 percent as reported by IBM in 2012) has been generated recently in the last two years, which is drawing consideration from both public and private sectors [1]. It has given rise to the new research field, i.e. Big Data. It is very challenging to store, analyze, gather and process the data by using the present methods because it is comprised of high velocity, highly dynamic, immense volume and numerous types of information (figure 1). Big Data represents new research in data exploitation and investigation; and various applications of industries are revolving around it [2]. These applications analyze supply chain from profit and hazard perspective [3], improve the performance of supply chains by cutting down the negative impacts of uncertainties [4], solve the scheduling problems of transportation systems [5] and also provide security and surveillance services to the infrastructure of the buildings, home and secure their private  Copyright (c) 2009 IEEE.

Many industrial enterprises pose strict constraints on the quality parameters of the manufacturing process of the products. Data about working conditions and manufacturing machines needs to be collected in real time manner. To ensure the proper working of the manufacturing process, to analyze the risk associated with plant or software, accurate gathering and processing of the data, is required [7]. But the gathering of real time data again poses a challenge. A solution to this problem is provided by wireless sensor networks (WSNs) [8].

WSN is the backbone of Big Data and it has become an integral part of Internet of Things (IoT) [9]. Gathering of data from indoor and outdoor environments; data transmission to the center; data processing tasks are some of the important functions of the WSNs.

Real time data is sensed and gathered by the various types of sensors such as proximity sensors, humidity sensors, thermal sensors, magnetic sensors, position sensors, flow sensors, etc.

From the industrial perspective, Big Data depict the immense volume of data gathered, stored, processed and managed for the various operations of industries. Second challenge, in front of industries operating via WSNs, is how to transmit the real time data to the data center after its congregation from the environment. Industrial sensor nodes require a lot of energy to relay the data accumulated from the environment sensors.

WSNs have limited lifetime due to the battery operated sensors and therefore it requires the energy conservation schemes [10].

To enhance the network lifetime of WSNs and to solve the challenges of Big Data (to gather the real time data), an energy efficient routing algorithm is required. Many energy efficient routing algorithms have been proposed in literature for this challenge. For example, Energy efficient clustering algorithms LEACH, TEEN, APTEEN and HEED [11] were proposed a long ago, but direct transmission of data via cluster heads (CHs) to the sink is not a feasible approach for large scale networks. However, in these distributed algorithms, clusters were based on the information of neighbor nodes. Therefore, an unequal load of energy on the nodes, recommended further improvements in the routing algorithms [12-13]. In [14], a routing algorithm analyzes the data with the help of sensor nodes and Big Data center manipulates and communicates with other members (for fire security system). Gathering of data by sensor nodes also reduces the overhead of Big Data by data centric approaches [15] and these types of approaches organize the sensed data in-network before storing it as Big Data [16]. Likewise, a weight coefficient adaptive-based indoor energy load-balanced routing algorithm (WAIER) is proposed in [17]. WAIER postpones its decision of routing on the basis of multiple attributes and elects only the optimal routing based    1551-3203 (c) 2016 IEEE.

Sequentially clustered energy efficient algorithm (S-EERP)  and randomly energy efficient algorithm (R-EERP) are pre- sented in [18]. In S-EERP, nodes are arranged sequentially in indoor environment, whereas in R-EERP, nodes are deployed randomly. Both of these are based on LEACH. Authors of [19] have shown the experiments over cooperative routing schemes and analyze the results for industrial production plant. A route selection algorithm has been proposed in [20]. Neighbor nodes share information with each other for industrial operations.

Local information is disseminated among the local nodes with less overhead. Its performance is optimized in different environments, but real time data gathering risk and constraints of industrial applications are not analyzed, therefore it cannot be used for Big Data applications and industrial applications without modification. A routing algorithm for large scale network has been proposed in [21] which is based on link quality and hop count. However, routing on the basis of hop count does not present an optimal solution for energy efficiency in terrestrial applications. A large number of sensors generate huge amount of data for the service providers which is steadily monitored for quality improvement and maintenance.

To monitor the conditions of the atmosphere, huge data is gathered by the electronic sensors. Electronic and mechanical sensors used for the health care services are a big source of data. But how to manage this data in an energy efficient manner is still an important issue.

Our main objective is to minimize wireless communication distance as energy depletion is directly proportional to the traveled distance [22]. To avoid the flooding of data (when all the sensor nodes requests for the data or transmit the data to the base station), we follow the static approach to determine the number of clusters. Flooding causes the problem in gathering accurate data from all the nodes. Earlier research supports the idea of increasing the number of clusters to conserve energy.

But in this paper, we advocate the idea, that large number of cluster heads degrades the performance in terms of time and energy. We use the received signal strength (RSSI), to transmit and receive the data.

In the proposed scheme for Big Data, we have devised an energy efficient algorithm in which energy is conserved in the process of forwarding and receiving data to and from the data center. This algorithm uses the information of received signal strength (RSSI) computed through the practical experiments on MICAz motes. To analyze the signal strength of the nodes, different experiments have been conducted [9]. Radio fre- quency (RF) propagation feature of MICAz motes antenna has been evaluated with ground level effect, from various elevation angles and distances. Link quality indicator (LQI) and received signal strength (RSSI) are significant parameters of RF link which are delivered by CC2420 (A true single-chip 2.4 GHz IEEE 802.15.4 compliant RF transceiver designed for low- power and low-voltage wireless). As mentioned in [9] value of RSSI can be computed by using following equation and it is stored in signed 2?s complement form in RSSI V ALthe register. RF power (RFpow) can be computed as:  RFpow = RSSI V AL + RSSIoffset (1)  Where RSSIoffset is approx. -45 db. We have presented the RSSI measures  in the proposed algorithm by using the equation 1. The data rate of CC2420 is 250kbps and RF receiving sensitiv- ity is -94dbm. It specifies that for efficient communication, received signal power should be more than the sensitivity level. Different observations have been concluded by varying number of experiments, i.e. by placing the transmitting and receiving motes in laboratory, field with grass, open field etc.

The signal characteristics are recorded in outdoor and indoor environment. According to these features it is concluded that quality parameters and deployment of WSN network should be optimized to gain the benefit of RF antenna propagation (RSSI) in the transmission and reception of data. According to this observation, a clustering algorithm based on RSSI, termed as big-data efficient gathering (BDEG) scheme is proposed to collect real time data for efficient industrial operations. In this algorithm, cluster head nodes (CHs), cluster coordinator nodes (CCOs), and relay nodes (RNs) are elected by considering the power level of RSSI and energy of the nodes which is essential for continuous operations of the industries. The proposed algorithm, builds route with energy efficiency by balancing the load on the CHs, CCOs and RNs for the gathering of the Big Data in an effective manner. The simulations show that it works well in terms of energy and time in comparison to other algorithms. The rest of the paper is organized as: Section II defines the testing system and Section III presents the testing process in a laboratory environment and analyzes the test results. Section IV describes the proposed algorithm.

Results discussion has been presented in section V followed by the concluding observation in section VI.



II. TESTING SYSTEM  To analyze the eminence of RSSI in RF propagation with ground effect and from different angles, MICAz motes OEM Edition (MPR2600J) have been used in the experiments [9] and these experiments have been conducted in the laboratory.

The WSN nodes are in a static state, and no interference exists    1551-3203 (c) 2016 IEEE. Personal use is permitted, but republication/redistribution requires IEEE permission. See http://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/rights/index.html for more information.

Measuring antenna (MA) and antenna under testing (AUT) on a stool, are placed at 3 meter, 5 meter and 7 meter distance in different scenarios.



III. LABORATORY ENVIRONMENT TESTING FOR RF PROPAGATION  The antenna under testing MICAz continuously transmitted the packets and these are received by the MA mote, which was connected to the computer. MA computed and stored the values of RSSI on the basis of packets received from AUT. In the first scenario, motes were placed on the ground and in the other, AUT was placed on the stool approximately, 0.65 meters above the ground. The distance between both the motes was same in both scenarios (3, 5, and 7 meters). The RSSI value of AUT was measured from different angles by set up of Z- axis at =0, 45 and 90. For scenarios results, readers can refer to the figures from 3 to 8 from [9]. It is concluded from the results that RSSI increases with a decrease in the distance.

The value of RSSI was strong in case of =0 as compared to 45 and 90. RSSI for =0, was circular and it did not affect by the ground effect (AUT was placed on the wooden stool). It was noticed that when AUT mote was placed on the table, then the RSSI signal was much stronger than another case. Standard deviation in case of AUT at table and with =0 was very less as compared to other cases. This work was partially supported by Keio University 21st Century Center of Excellence Program on Optical and Electronic Device Technology for Access Network and Fujitsu Laboratories. From these experiments the signal transmission features can be drawn as follows:  1) As the RSSI value decreases with an increase in dis- tance and it affects the path loss, i.e. path loss increases with an increase in distance.

2) The path loss is high with effect to the ground as compared to communication above the ground.

3) Path loss also increases via obstacles in the communi- cation path.

4) Two nodes placed at the different angles and position, but with same distance, exhibit different results due to ground effect.

5) Data can be lost due to the obstacles between the communicating nodes due to high path loss (strength of RSSI will be decreased in great extent).

The above features of WSN signal are summarized on the basis of the experiments mentioned above. These features provide the base for the research in important technologies and algorithms (Big Data gathering) of WSN. The Big Data algorithm can face the following technical challenges on the basis of above concluded features.

1) Distance information cannot help WSN to facilitate communication between the two nodes due to ground level effect.

2) Even If two nodes guarantee the communication, data can be lost due to the effect of path loss.

Consequently, we require an algorithm, which could fa- cilitate the communication among the nodes and hence the data gathering, by reducing distance between them and by balancing load on them. A Big Data algorithm requires data  to be gathered from the densely deployed network, therefore it should be more fault tolerant and reliable when communication takes place in an outdoor environment. Since, more energy is consumed in the outdoor environment as compared to indoor due to increase in the value of path loss.



IV. BDEG: CLUSTERING BASED BIG DATA GATHERING ALGORITHM FOR DENSELY DEPLOYED WSN  In this section, we have first outlined the problem of clustering and challenges in WSN. We have introduced the network model in the next subsection and overview of working of BDEG, a proposed algorithm is given subsequently.

A. Clustering Problem  To find out the optimal strategy in WSN to gather the data, the challenges of reduction in energy consumption and search of the location to collect the data at one point required to be resolved in an efficient manner. These challenges raise two questions: 1) how to divide the nodes into clusters and 2) what is the optimal number of clusters. The energy required for data transmission is directly proportional to the distance. The problem of transmitting data to the far away base station (BS) increases when the transmitting node is at the other end of the area and receiving base station is on the other end. Signal of the transmitting node will get fade in the long distance and it will also require lots of energy to transmit the data.

To solve this problem, either data have to be transmitted via relay nodes elected in the route from source node to the BS or via some shortest path routing algorithm. In real time Big Data gathering scheme, the second method is less optimal, since searching of shortest path in densely deployed network will consume more time and wastage of time is not feasible in industrial or real time operations. The best method is to develop a transmission algorithm to form the clusters by simple formula and to facilitate the multi-hop routing via balancing load on the nodes when they will be performing the role of relay nodes.

It will help in reducing the transmitting distance of the farthest nodes, although the distance of the path will be computed via summation of the distance of all the relay nodes in the route to the BS which may be larger. But our main problem of transmitting data of the far away sensor node to the BS should be solved without making the network obsolete (when some of the nodes in some region deplete their energy completely due to huge transmitting distance). In that case, we would like to reduce the sum of the square of the distance of each node to the BS. The proposed method,uses the multi- hop communication to transmit and collect the data in the data center. It minimizes the square of the distance of the nodes to the BS.

B. Analytical Model  A network consisted of base station situated at the border area and thousands of the industrial sensors deployed randomly in the fixed area, is considered in proposed algorithm. Location of the industrial sensor nodes is crucial information to be    1551-3203 (c) 2016 IEEE. Personal use is permitted, but republication/redistribution requires IEEE permission.

This article has been accepted for publication in a future issue of this journal, but has not been fully edited. Content may change prior to final publication. Citation information: DOI 10.1109/TII.2017.2656899, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics   transmitted to the BS and other sensor nodes to initiate the process of data collection. With the help of experiments discussed in IIIrd section, we concluded that RSSI is the important parameter to transmit and receive the data from the nodes. Therefore, we assume that the distance of the nodes is computed by localization methods based on RSSI. A sensor node has limited range of communication and communication is possible only if the other node is in that range. CHs are deployed in the clusters to gather the data of the local cluster.

CHs (equipped with buffers) store the data, until they get any signal from BS to transmit the data. The data is transmitted in multi-hop technique. In proposed methodology, we assume the network deployed over dense and large area such as for border surveillance, environment monitoring, etc. Figure 2, shows the assumed network model where N number of nodes are de- ployed randomly, shown in circular shape. The area is divided into K clusters, shown in dotted lines. L and B are the length and breadth of the area. In each cluster solid blue colored circle represents the CH while green colored circle shows the RN.

In all the clusters except first one from the bottom, cluster coordinators are elected (CCOs shown in double circle) for inter-cluster communication. In this paper cluster means sub- area (network area is divided into the subareas, according to the fixed length and breadth). As opposed to [26], nodes in the different clusters can communicate with the help of CCOs.

Every cluster has a CCO in its adjacent cluster to gather the data of cluster lying below to it. The number of nodes in each cluster is random and when we simulated proposed algorithm in MATLAB, we found that after random distribution each cluster has 99% same number of nodes. RNs in each cluster are coordinated with the local nodes to transmit their data to the CH when distance of the local nodes is greater than the distance of the RNs to the CH. RNs are computed with the help of RSSI and location of the nodes.

C. Overview of Proposed Algorithm for Big Data Gathering  The proposed scheme in this paper, can be used for re- liable data gathering in the industry and border surveillance operations, which requires that network should continue its task even if some of the nodes have depleted their energy (fault tolerant) and network should not become obsolete (load balance on the nodes can avoid this problem). Therefore, this requirement motivated us to develop an algorithm where SNs could gather the data according to this vital property of WSN.

Various symbols and their meanings used in the proposed method are shown in table 2. The transmission process takes place as:  1) Data is collected at the CHs at regular intervals.

2) Data is transmitted to the BS, when some change in  the previous data is noticed (to conserve energy via reducing redundancy) otherwise it is discarded.

3) In case the buffer space reaches to its threshold level, then a comparison is made at that stage to find out the change in data and decision to transmit or discard the data is taken.

4) If at any time the level of energy of CHs or CCOs is found less than the threshold, then their election  Fig. 2: Structure of Data Communication in BDEG  is again facilitated by the calling the CH or CCO election algorithm (in which the nodes with a higher energy level get the role of CH or CCO; for reliable communication). The process of transmission of BDEG executes in rounds like [20] but they are not fixed. They are based on the residual energy level of SNs.

1) Clusters are built on the basis of fixed dimensions, in the simulations, we have divided the 200 square meters area into 10 clusters with a dimension 200 meter by 20 meter.

2) Information about clusters is broadcasted by the BS in the initial phase of the transmission round and SNs compute their information by localized algorithm. In the initial phase, BS broadcasts the message which contains its signal information (converted into RSSI) BSRSSI , CHid,CCOid and RNid are allocated to each node.

Signals transmitted by the BS cover all the SNs. Each node can transmit data to the BS and stored the value of NRSSI BSi where N is the total number of nodes (i is the id of the nodes, i=1, 2. . . .N ). Each node uses the RSSI value of BS to predict the path loss value between that SN and BS. SNs can compute whether they can transmit data directly to BS or not by using the following equation:  BSRSSI ?NRSSI BSi < NRSSI f ?NRSSI min (2)  Where NRSSI f represents fixed transmission power of SNs and NRSSI min is the minimum value of RSSI computed by SN. If this equation returns the value positively, then SN can transmit data directly to BS (Fbit = 1) otherwise via transmission algorithm i.e.

(Fbit = 0) via CCOs, CHs and RNs.Fbit is used to know the direct or indirect transmission to the BS. A CH node should have more energy than the threshold level to collect and transmit the data to the CCO or BS.

BDEG uses the residual energy of nodes (Nresi E) to compute capability of nodes to elect as CCO or CH or RN and NRSSI BSi to estimate the speed of transmission (it exhibits the performance of BDEG,,PN i ). Each node computes it by the following equation where WN i is a weight coefficient of SN:  PN i = WN i ?Nresi E + (1?WN i)?NRSSI BSi (3)  In selection of CH, CCO and RN, BDEG uses at- tributes, residual energy and distance of the nodes.

Consequently, each CH node computes its own Pchby using the following equation:  Pch = Wch ?Nresi E + (1?Wch)?NRSSI BSi (4)  In the same way RN and CCO computes their Prnand Pccousing the equation 4.

3) Broadcasting of SNs Information to form the neigh- bor node set is accomplished by sharing their infor- mation within the same cluster. Each SN broadcasts its information in a set that is comprised of its ID Ni,PN i,Pch,Pcco,Prnand Fbit. This information forms the neighbor set as all the information of nodes is shared among all the local nodes and it can define as:  Nj = {Ni,PN i, Pchi , Pccoi,Prni , Fbiti} (5)  Where Nj is the neighbor node which stores the infor- mation of inode.

4) Election of CHs, CCOs and RNs is based on trans- mission algorithm. Each node compares its value of Nresi E with other nodes and node with high energy, becomes the cluster head. Cluster coordinators are formed on the basis of highest energy level and number of CCOs is based on the number of clusters beneath to them. For example, if they have two clusters beneath the cluster where CCOs are elected, then there will be two CCOs, one for each cluster. RNs are elected on the basis of the minimum distant algorithm of LEACH [14] which forwards the data of local nodes to CH if their distance is greater than elected RN to CH.

Information about elected RNs and ID of the CH is sent in a local message to all the nodes in the local cluster. Information of elected CCOs is shared among all the clusters because data of all CHs are forwarded to the BS via CCOs if their Fbit = 0. .

5) In proposed scheme, energy and time are conserved while taking decision on, which cluster Non-CH nodes belong to because clusters are predetermined on the basis of dimensions, as mentioned in the first point.

This information is stored at BS and transmitted to all the nodes during the broadcasting of signals in initial phase. Non-CHs compute their flag bit, to determine the direct or indirect transmission of data.

6) CHs have no need to elect the forwarding nodes (in con- trast to [20], SEP and LEACH), this is accomplished by CCOs which facilitate the inter-cluster communication when the distance of BS from CHs is large.

7) Data is transmitted to the BS after cluster set up phase.

Each node in their local cluster forward data to the RN if their distance is large from CH than RN else they transmit data directly to CH. After receiving data from RN or SN, CH stores it till it receives the data from all the nodes and then forwards the data to upper cluster CCO. That CCO also computes its distance from BS, by using equation 1, and forwards it to the next level CCO if equation 1 returns the false value of the comparison.

This process continues till data is finally submitted to the BS.

The cluster configuration and transmission process is based on RSSI and residual energy of the SNs for all the applications.

The network connectivity is achieved by the proper formation of cluster structure. Fault tolerant parameter is also ensured, that is when two communicating nodes run out of energy then re-election algorithm for election of new CHs and CCOs is performed to make the operations continue. If BDEG is applied to applications where real time constraint is not much stringent, then there is less need of some fault tolerance action. But if real time requirements are strict, BDEG can set the time slot long for data transmission, so that data from all the nodes could be gathered. 1) Data of all the nodes is monitored by the BS 2) if waiting time increases than pre-fixed time interval, re-structuring of clusters is performed in the next round.



V. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS AND RESULTS DISCUSSION  A Big Data algorithm, BDEG is proposed in this paper on the basis of industrial, environmental and border surveillance applications. Simulations have been carried out in MATLAB and RSSI experiments were performed in the laboratory as explained in [9].

Parameters used in simulations have been shown in Table 1.

The following observations have been made:  1) Network Lifetime: It is defined as the time skyline until the death of first node, but on the other side, it is defined as the total time till the death of the last node. The network lifetime reveals the fact of energy efficiency of sensor nodes. The more energy efficient network will have long network lifetime.

2) Standard deviation: Balanced energy depletion in the network will cause less standard deviation. After the death of a few nodes, if industrial SNs are not working for longer, it shows the high standard deviation. It is achieved by the maintenance of fault tolerance and reliability parameters.

1) Analysis of Standard Deviation: Standard deviation affects the reliability i.e. when it is high, then the reliability of the particular parameter is less and vice versa. The main constraint in Big Data applications is to transmit data in time and data transmission rate should be consistent. In figure 3, comparison of all the protocols has been shown to measure the stabil-  ity (stability means to transmit the data continuously without obsoletion of the network) in data transmission time. ERP (yellow color) and genetic HCR (green color) protocols, consumes lot of time in data transmission.

These protocols are not suitable for real time operations.

Proposed scheme and SEP both protocols, are stable in data transmission. Therefore, the standard deviation in both the protocols is less than one. But other protocols are not stable as compared to BDEG, hence proposed algorithm can be used for Big Data applications where real time data transmission is required. It can be clearly observed that SEP is also reliable but it does not stand for long to transmit the data and all the SNs in SEP de- plete their energy faster than BDEG. Therefore, BDEG is more optimal in terms of real time data transmission and more suitable for Big Data applications.

2) Analysis of Network Lifetime: Network lifetime of the nodes is affected by many parameters as imbalance load, network obsoleting, long distance, data transmis- sion, etc. In BDEG, a scheme is opted to minimize the distance of data transmission of the nodes. Multi- hop, multi-layer communication via RNs, CCOs and CHs helped BDEG to optimize the parameter of energy consumption. Distance has been reduced for the SNs that is they need to transmit the data at small distance and it requires less energy. For example, if a SN wants to transmit the data to the BS and its distance as computed by equation 1 is large then it tries to know its distance from the CH.

If sensor nodes distance to CH is greater than the distance to RN then it transmits its data to the RN which helps in transmitting the data to the CH. CH further 3 transmit the data to the CCO of the next level cluster as shown in figure 2. This process continues till the data is gathered at the data center.

For SNs, If disCh > disrn ? transmitrn else transmit ? CH .

Data Communication in BDEG takes place as follows:  SN ? RN ? CH ? CCO ? BS (6)  Major constraint in designing of routing algorithms for    1551-3203 (c) 2016 IEEE.

Figure 4, illustrates the network lifetime for seven algorithms with respect to data transmission time. Network lifetime for BDEG (Yellow Color) can be observed is longer than other algorithms and its time consumption in data transmission is less than other algorithms. It takes 632 milliseconds in transmitting data in 5000 rounds and number of alive nodes after these transmissions, is 1 which is less than EESAA (Red Color), where 3 nodes are alive after 5000 rounds. But EESAA takes 7891 milliseconds to transmit data which is very high as compared to the proposed scheme (approx. 12 times higher than BDEG).

Other algorithms are inefficient in both network lifetime and transmission time; therefore they are not suitable for Big Data applications. Network stability has been shown in figure 5, with respect to the number of dead nodes during data transmission. EESAA and BDEG, both algorithms are stable in terms of dead nodes after 5000 rounds of data transmission as all nodes in other algorithms are dead very early and at most in 3389 rounds.

The network is not stable in other algorithms and without network stability Big Data gathering for real time operations is not feasible. The reason for this optimization in network stability and network lifetime is due to the load balancing on the data forwarding nodes (because all CCOs and CHs have load of one cluster only). When energy of data forwarding nodes is less than the threshold level their role is exchanged with high residual energy nodes. In other algorithms, data is transmitted directly to the CHs and the number of clusters is based on the algorithm used in LEACH.

It is proved in these algorithms that a high number of clusters conserve more energy. But in BDEG, number of clusters is 10 and data is transmitted in multi-hop fashion not only at the intra cluster, but also in the inter cluster communication which is the design strategy of getting better results than earlier protocols. The main objective of BDEG is to reduce the energy of SNs by                 x 10  Number of Dead Nodes  Network Stability With Respect to Data Transmission Time  Number of Rounds  T im e in S e c o n d s  BDEG  EESAA  Mod-LEACH  LEACH  SEP  ERP  Genetic HCR  Fig. 5: Comparison of Network Stability  transmitting data at the shorter distance. This objective, has led to the major savings in both the parameters i.e.

energy and time. If the data is sent either directly to the CHs or to the BS as like comparative protocols, then proposed algorithm will break down. Genetic protocols, i.e. HCR and ERP, both are not suitable in terms of energy and time. LEACH, MOD-LEACH and SEP are energy efficient protocols, but SNs deplete their energy earlier than BDEG and EESAA algorithms.

EESAA is energy efficient and stable, but its standard deviation and time of data transmission is higher than proposed method. This indicates that BDEG is more stable and reliable than other algorithms. The proposed algorithm has reduced the standard deviation by 47% approximately. The reason for this optimization is load balancing of the forwarding nodes. They are elected on the basis of high residual energy and comprehensive consideration of the path loss. Therefore, energy is de- pleted uniformly. But in comparative algorithms, energy depletion is highly uneven.



VI. CONCLUSION  In the proposed scheme, deployment of a large number of nodes is considered to identify the stringent requirements of WSN. Experimental evaluation, to recognize the various features of WSN has been taken into consideration like ground level effects on WSN signals which affect the data transmission among nodes. The signal transmission features of WSN are primed from experimental analysis and an energy efficient Big Data gathering algorithm called BDEG has been proposed for real time Big Data application like border surveillance, environmental monitoring and industrial operations. In the proposed scheme, RSSI values are used to determine the direct or indirect communication of SNs with BS. Constraint of energy and time are solved via BDEG and discussed in the section IV. Cluster formation and re-structuring makes the BDEG more reliable and optimized. The performance of novel scheme is compared with traditional and well known algo- rithms. Experimental simulations show that BDEG can attain    1551-3203 (c) 2016 IEEE. Personal use is permitted, but republication/redistribution requires IEEE permission.

Future work will concentrate on reducing the total distance for data transmission and will consider the other parameters like signal to noise ratio and bit error rate to more optimize the BDEG algorithm.
