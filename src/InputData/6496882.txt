Tracking Performance of Upgraded "Polished Panel"  Optical Receiver on NASA's 34 meter Research Antenna

Abstract-There has been considerable interest in developing and demonstrating a hybrid "polished panel" optical receiver  concept that would replace the microwave panels on the Deep Space Network's (DSN) 34 meter antennas with highly  polished aluminum panels, thus enabling simultaneous optical  and microwave reception I. A test setup has been installed on  the 34 meter research antenna at DSS-13 (Deep Space Station  13) at NASA's Goldstone Deep Space Communications  Complex in California in order to assess the feasibility of this  concept. Here we describe the results of a recent effort to  dramatically reduce the dimensions of the point-spread  function (PSF) generated by a custom polished panel, thus  enabling improved optical communications performance.

The latest results are compared to the previous configuration  in terms of quantifiable PSF improvement. In addition, the  performance of acquisition and tracking algorithms designed  specifically for the polished panel PSF are evaluated and  compared, based on data obtained from real-time tracking of  planets and bright stars with the 34 meter research antenna at  DSS-13.
