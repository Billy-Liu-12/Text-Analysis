Association Rules Application to Identify Customer  Purchase Intention in a Real-time Marketing

Abstract?To make real-time marketing tools for online storefronts, it is necessary to understand intentions of customers who are connecting on the storefronts. One of important customer intention may be whether a customer intends to purchase or not in the current session. In this paper, we propose customer purchase probability prediction method based on clickstream data using association rule generation techniques.

Clickstream data is converted to session data, and the session data is used to generated association and disassociation rules using data mining tools. We propose a method to predict customer purchase probabilities based on the confidence values of the generated association rules. The usefulness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using a real internet bookstore clickstream data set.

I.  INTRODUCTION Comparing to offline stores, internet storefronts have  advantages in gathering customer behavior data. Based on collected customer data, it is possible to provide intelligence customer services including personalized recommendation and real-time promotion. To support small and medium size internet storefronts, a real-time marketing tool which is called as SeeToc is developing [5]. The system includes features such as real-time customer monitoring, intelligent customer management, and mobile access. The tool makes it possible human marketers to monitor connected customers through monitoring system and to provide instant personalized message based on marketers? decision making. To support intelligent customer management functionality in the tool, we want to identify customers who have high purchase intention among currently connected customers based on up-to-date customer behavior. To predict purchase probability within a session, this paper proposes a method based on association rule generation techniques. Association rules among visiting web page types are generated based on clickstream data and web page classification. Based on real-time customer behavior, the estimated purchase probability is updated based on generated association rules. The performance of the proposed method is  compared with state-transition models which had been studies in the related previous studies using real clickstream data of online bookstore [2]. The structure of this paper is as follows.

In section 2, we review on clickstream data, real-time marketing tools, and association rule generation techniques. In section 3, our proposed approach is described with an example.

In section 4, brief conclusion remarks are presented.



II. RELATED WORKS  A. Clickstream Data and Real-time Marketing Tools Clickstream data is log data which captures the traces of  visitors on web sites [4]. Usually, clickstream data includes IP addresses of visitors, time to visit, visiting URLs, visitors? browser types, visitors? OSs, and so on. Basically, clickstream data on internet storefronts can be used to monitor visiting trends of customers of the internet storefronts. Also, clickstream data can be used for more advanced services such as personalized recommendation and intelligent promotion.

Recently, there are trials to use clickstream data for real-time monitoring. For example, NETHRU Inc.?s SeeToc system is representative real-time customer monitoring system [5].

B. Association Rule Generation Techniques Association rule generation techniques are representative  undirected data mining techniques, which automatically generate association rules of product items [3]. Association rules between product items are useful for marketers, which can be applied for products or service packaging, product display layout design, and cross-sales. The following rule is a typical example of association rules.

IF A & B THEN C    (1)    The association rule in (1) implies that customers who buy item A and B also buy item C. Disassociation rules are rules which include ?NOT? prefix. The following is an example of  This work was supported by Seoul Industry-Academy-Research Collaboration Project (JP100080) funded by Seoul City.

disassociation rules which means that that customers who buy item A and B also do not buy item C.

IF A & B THEN ?C    (2)    There are three important measures to evaluate association rules; Support, Confidence, and Lift. Support measures the proportion of transactions that contain all the items in the rule.

Confidence measures the strength of association rules, and Lift which is also called Improvement measures the power of the rule by comparing the full rule to randomly guessing.

Confidence of the rule in (1) is defined as follows.

Confidence(IF A & B THEN C) = P(A?B?C)/P(A?B)     (3)

III. PROPOSED APPROACH The pages of online stores can be classified with several  types. For example, web pages of an internet bookstore can be classified into 11 types; HO (Home page), AC (Personal account page), SE (Search page), CA (Category page), PT (Product information page), IN (Usage information page), PR (Promotion page), SO (Social page), SC (Shopping cart page), OD (Order page), and OT (Other page). For example, a session, CA PT SC OT PT SE PR PR SE SE CA PT SC SE OD means that a customer visits category page (CA) first, moves to product information (PT), moves to shopping cart page (SC), and so on. The overall experimental procedure to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach is shown in Fig. 1.

A. Session Data Generation First, the session data set is generated from 4 month  clickstream data of an online bookstore in Korea [2]. From the clickstream data set which has 39,066 URLs, we can generate 2,090 sessions of customers. Since there are no obvious separators between sessions of a customer in clickstream data, we consider time information to separate sessions from the same IP address. Session data set is divided into two disjoint subsets, training data set and test data set. That is, sessions are divided randomly into two subsets with the same probabilities to belong the two subsets.

B. Data Preprocessing The format of session data cannot be directly used in data  mining tools (In this study, we use SPSS Modeler1 of IBM Inc.

for association rule generation). So, the session data is transformed as it can be used in the data mining tool. The sessions in the training data set are pivoted in order to generate association rules. Also, for the test data set, since we want to predict purchase probability for each step, the data set is also transformed as suitable format to predict purchase probabilities for individual steps of sessions.

Except order page (OD), 10 page types are defined as input variables, and order page (OD) is defined as an output variables. Using Apriori algorithm in SPSS Modeler, we generated association rules which include order page (OD) as conclusion part [1]. For example, the following rules are generated from the training data set.

IF SC THEN OD (Confidence = 61.5%)  (4)  IF SC & OT THEN OD (Confidence = 51.4%) (5)    The first rule means that 61.5 % of customers who visit shopping cart page (SC) visit order page (OD). The second rule implies that 51.4% of customers who visit shopping cart page (SC) and other page (OT) visit order page (OD).

Figure 1.  Experimental Procedure  D. Disassocation Rule Generation Similarly, disassociation rules are generated with ?NOT?  order page (?OD) as output page type.  For example, the following are examples of generated disassociation rules.

IF CA THEN ?OD (Confidence = 90.8%) (6)  IF CA & PT THEN ?OD (Confidence = 88.5%) (7)    The first rule means that 90.8 % of customers who visit category page (CA) do not visit order page (OD). The second rule implies that 88.5% of customers who visit category page (CA) and product information page (OT) do not visit order page (OD). From the above two disassociation rules, we can calculate Confidence values of the following two rules which have order page (OD) as conclusion part.

IF CA THEN OD (Confidence = 9.2%)  (8)  IF CA & PT THEN OD (Confidence = 11.5%) (9)    The two type of rule sets which are generated from association rule generation and disassociation rule generation from training data set are merged as a rule set. The rules in the rule set include order page (OD) as conclusion part. We use disassociation rule generation in order that there is at least one rule which can be fired for individual steps of sessions.

E. Purchase Probailibity Prediction Purchase probabilities of a customer in test data set are  predicted at individual steps of a session using rules in the merged rule set. That is, the purchase probabilities are calculated based on Confidence values of fired association rules. However, there are problematic when more than two rules are fired for the current step in a session. In the paper, we use an intuitive heuristic to resolve the situation. If we compare two rules in (4) and (5), we can easily find that the rule in (5) concludes with more information of the session than the rule in (4). So, we try to follow Confidence values of rules which reflect more information of the current session. Indeed, the purchase probability (PP) of a customer c at the current step cs is defined as follows.

?? (c|cs) = MAX{Confidence(rule) | SIZE(rule) = MAX{SIZE(rule) | rule?{FIRED_RULE(cs)}}}  (10)    In (10), the size of a rule is defined as the number of page types in condition part. For example, the sizes of rules in (4) and (5) are 1 and 2, respectively.

As a example, let assume that a customer c has a session CA PT SC OT PT SE PR PR SE SE CA PT SC SE OD, which has 14 steps except order page (OD). In the first step, ?CA,? only one rule in (8) is a firing rule. So, the PP(c|CA) is defined as 9.2%. In the case of the fourth step of the session, ?CA PT SC OT,? four rules, (4), (5), (8), and (9) can be fired. Among them, the sizes of rules in (4) and (8) are 1, and the sizes of rules in (5) and (9) are 2. So, based on two Confidence values of rules in (5) and (9), PP(c|CA PT SC OT) is defined as  51.4%. Fig. 2 shows changes of predicted purchase probabilities for individual steps of the session.

Currently we are trying to compare the performance of the proposed approach with other approaches include methods using state-transition matrix [2].

IV. CONCLUSION In this paper, we propose a purchase probability prediction  method based on association rule generation techniques. From clickstream data, session data set is generated, and association and disassociation rules are generated to predict whether customers will purchase or not based on current session information. The Confidence values of fired association rules are used to predict purchase probabilities of customers. The experiments to compare with other approaches are in progress.

If the proposed techniques are applied in real-time marketing tools, human marketers can more effectively focus on promising customers based on predicted purchase probabilities of customers. As a further research issue, sequential rule generation techniques can be applied to the customer purchase probability prediction problem.
