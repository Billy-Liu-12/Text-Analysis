Abstract?This paper will discuss the progression of army seeker systems from a single mode to a multi-mode configuration.  This progression is in part due to the effects of weather on seeker system performance.  This discussion will be based on computer simulations and climatological data and test data.  The relationships between frequency and range will be explored as they interact with the weather.

This effort is being conducted in the RF Technology Function of the Applied Sensors, Guidance, and Electronics Division, U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) on the Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama.

While there is extensive work in this area, which is represented here in a condensed form, this paper will go into greater detail of the attenuation due to rainfall rates and cloud water content.  The ground work for this effort was described in a paper ?Weather and Radar Interactions.  This research is a continuation of that work.  The goal is to update the current trend in seeker development.

The data obtained from this effort will be used to support the selection of new seeker system parameters.  The effects of the weather would impact the selection of operating frequency and modes.

This paper will also present some of the early test bed results of multimode seeker trials. 12   TABLE OF CONTENTS
