DICOM Metadata Aggregation from Multiple  Healhtcare Facilities

Abstract? Medical imaging procedures generate an  enormous amount of information that is stored in multiple storage units by Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS). Using Dicoogle and Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine (DICOM) metadata the authors developed a merging and reconciliation procedure to create a seamlessly unique PACS view. This procedure was applied to the metadata held by 19 storage units of a PACS of a Portuguese hospital centre composed by three branches. In total, more than 36 million images, from more than ten modalities were collected. The merging and reconciliation procedure have proven to be robust and efficient. This shows that it is possible to merge the metadata collected from multiple PACS into a single unified view, preserving the relation between patients, studies, and images, which is essential for large-scale analyses of medical imaging repositories from multiple institutions.

I. INTRODUCTION The use of imaging studies to clarify a broad range of  clinical situations promoted the production of enormous amounts of data. Traditionally, the imaging studies are stored and managed using Picture Archiving and Communications Systems (PACS). In this context, the use of the Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine (DICOM) [1] standard for the management of imaging studies has a key role.

The DICOM image metadata can be used in efficiency metrics for imaging device productivity [2] or to provide data for different initiatives such as, for example, development of medical imaging performance indicators [2,3,4] or biomedical research [5].

In the hospital environment, the access to information produced by medical imaging departments involves the interaction with the Radiology Information System (RIS) and PACS. The physical storage of the studies in the PACS is often  done using multiple physical media (disks) whose number increases according to the storage needs [6]. Moreover, the integration, access and image data analysis is based on a set of complex procedures performed by imaging devices and information systems responsible for the transmission, reception and storage of medical images. This scenario makes it very difficult, or even impossible, to analyse information not only produced in by several types of equipment from different manufacturers, but also stored in a broad range of physical and logical information systems.

In the Portuguese health care context, there has been a change in the management policies of health care facilities in recent years, which has promoted the creation of hospital centres made up of several different hospitals with different health care profiles and sometimes with its information management systems and infrastructures such as RIS and PACS.

In the case of imaging studies stored in the PACS archive, these either are managed autonomously in each health unit or can be centrally managed, whether or not they use migration processes from imaging studies to centralized archives. In any case, it is appropriate to have a global view of healthcare delivery in the medical imaging field, including population studies, but also in the context of patient-focused research, and it may be very pertinent to aggregate stored imaging studies in different media and physical locations.

This article presents a method to aggregate medical imaging information from multiple healthcare facilities integrating a regional hospital centre. The PACS information of these healthcare facilities was indexed using the Dicoogle Opensource PACS [7,8], resulting in several distinct databases of DICOM metadata. These databases were then aggregated into a single instance. Besides describing this method, this document also presents its validation process, as well as examples of the extracted information.



II. BACKGROUND The analyses of the stored data related to medical imaging  are complex and require demanding resources.  One of the causes for this complexity is the fact that manufacturers often use their own interpretation of international standards for the exchange and storage of information such as, the DICOM standard [1] implementation of private information strategies for the record and storage of information.

The DICOM standard defines objects, services, protocols, and conformance requirements, and establishes the prerequisites for effective communication between different medical imaging equipment. Consequently, the DICOM Information Model (DIM) aims to represent the characteristics or attributes of real world objects logically grouped into different modules (e.g. Image or Patient). According to DIM, the information elements are organized as Information Modules (IM), Information Entities (IE), and Information Object Definition (IOD). These are hierarchically linked structures: one or more IM creates an IE and a set of IE?s forms an IOD. Each IE contains instances for a specific process to which they belong (e.g. image acquisition) or a real world entity (e.g. the Patient, Image, or Equipment) [9]. The DICOM standard specifies the instances that are part of a specific IOD.

The data associated with each of the modules is characterized by a unique identifier called tag and a value field or attribute. The use of a DICOM data mining tool can be a valuable asset to analyze the information stored in the DICOM file. Although much of the information currently associated with the image acquisition is stored in the RIS, there is also information, namely information related to medical reports, which is stored in the DICOM file object [10].

For the analyses of DICOM metadata produced in the medical imaging departments, including data resulting from imaging studies produced by equipment of different manufacturers, there is the need to develop strategies to access and analyse the retrieved information. The integration of different health care facilities in hospital centres, with centralized management of patients and resources, promoted the development of various computer solutions to support medical imaging. Some of these solutions are based on the maintenance of legacy PACS archives. Other solutions were born for the centralized information storage and management of data existing in PACS archives from different geographical locations, which promoted changes in storage, communication and data management infrastructures, namely at the level of physical media for imaging studies and associated DICOM metadata storage and analysis.

A possible strategy to aggregate DICOM data produced by different sources would be the development of tools that are independent of equipment manufacturers. In this scope, the Dicoogle [7,8] is a solution that can contribute to the analysis of data produced by a broad range of medical imaging department?s equipment and stored in different physical media (disks) and PACS. Dicoogle is a free and open source alternative solution that allows the extraction of all textual information from the PACS archives through flexible queries over DICOM metadata. According to this approach, it is  possible to index all existent DICOM data elements (text- based) without the need to create new fields, new tables, and new relations that would be necessary in approaches such as the creation of new databases to import and store all the existing PACS information accordingly to a normalized database structure. Dicoogle index engine is based on Apache Lucene [11], a Java index and search library that is used in a large variety of applications.



III. MATERIAL AND METHODS The present study took place in a Portuguese hospital centre  composed by three branches. Proper authorizations to the Hospital Board of Directors and to the Ethics Commission were requested making sure that confidentiality of the collected data was guaranteed.

The DICOM metadata access, indexing and exporting process was achieved using Dicoogle installed on healthcare facility machines to systematically access the PACS information. The institutional PACS archive consisted of 19 disks.  The disks were indexed separately to ensure that all the images metadata in the PACS was correctly captured.

The merging procedure was accomplished by a spinoff application of the Dicoogle, which was developed specially for the purpose of this study. This application gathers all indexes created by Dicoogle in the indexing process and combines them into a unique index/database. In order to avoid some information quality issues an information normalization procedure was developed.

Although seeming a straightforward operation, the union of the existing databases produced incoherent data.  Firstly, there was a problem with the Patient Identification Attribute.

The same PatientID value was found for patients with different names. This issue was likely caused by registering patients concurrently on the different branches. Furthermore, the Study Instance Identifiers also presents duplicates when aggregating the information. This clearly violates the DICOM guidelines, and it seems to be consequence of software malfunctions. In order to mitigate the effect of these issues, it was implemented an algorithm to merge all the information from the different databases (see Algorithm 1). According this algorithm, the first step was a union operation performed on all datasets, without any data integrity constraint, on the image level data.

As described in the background section, the DICOM standard defines several information levels, namely Patient, Study, Series and Image and, by using all the image level attributes, there is the possibility to capture all the data attributes that were stored along the image in the DICOM file.

After the first step, the result is a database of image level data, from which is not possible to retrieve any coherent information about the upper levels. Therefore, the second step aims to mitigate this issue by generating alternative identifiers for the Study and Patient information levels. For the Patient level, the attributes that more clearly identify the stakeholders are PatientID and PatientName. In order to unequivocally identify the Patient, both this attributes were used. Therefore, for each image entry in the database, a Message Digest    algorithm 5 (MD5) digest processes the concatenation of these attributes (Fig.1: Algorithm 1 / Step 1).

The MD5 output digest is the same as long as the inputs are equal. As a result, a different identity is generated for each different pair of PatientID and PatientName (Fig.1: Algorithm 1 / Step 2). In an attempt to correct minor entry errors, some normalization operations, such as trimming and changing to lower case, are applied to the attributes values. In the next step, a similar procedure was performed for the Study level.

This time the StudyInstanceUID and the StudyDate attributes are the targets (Fig.1: Algorithm 1 / Step 3). The generated digests are stored in the database as separate fields and used as keys to reference the specific information level.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION In order to validate the DICOM metadata aggregation  process, it was performed over de global index a query to identify the individual history of imaging studies related to the patient with more registered studies. Furthermore, the results were compared with the similar results obtained by queries performed separately in each one of the 19 partial indexes.

The DICOM metadata indexing, aggregation and normalization processes resulted in the acquisition of data from more than 36562284 images, belonging to 1321755 studies, performed on 435866 patients (Table I), and related with more than 10 modalities (Table II)  TABLE I.

On the other hand, 6469 studies of other modalities were also identified but are not present in Table II.

For the validation of the aggregated information, several queries were performed over the studies carried out in the year 2015 and there were no discrepancies in the results, namely when it was performed the query to identify the individual history of imaging studies related to the patient with more registered studies (Table III).

xxxx.x.xxxxx941 25-Feb-16 US  NL ? Near-line storage media  When the query was made on the global index for the analysis of the individual history of imaging studies related to the patient with more registered imaging studies conducted in 2015, 22 studies were identified regarding CR, US, and CT modalities between day December 17, 2014, and February 25, 2016. These studies were stored on different near-line (NL)    disks over time, more specifically on disks NL_16, NL_17, NL_18 and NL_19 (Table III).

The confirmation of information integrity, both in the global index and in the partial index (resulting from the indexing of the disks separately) provides an indication of the robustness of the indexing and aggregation process of DICOM metadata from different medical imaging equipment and potentially multiple PACS archives.



V. CONCLUSION These results show that it is possible to merge the metadata collected from multiple PACS into a single unified view, preserving the relation between patients, studies, and images.

Moreover, this opens the door for the large-scale analyses of medical imaging repositories from multiple institutions, which can have a huge impact in epidemiological studies targeting large populations.

The study shows that the information normalization procedure is very valuable for research purposes because it enables to preserve the integrity of the collected databases without discarding any information about the images. This procedure can also be useful for PACS database migrations.
