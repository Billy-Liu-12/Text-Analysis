I. INTRODUCTION At present, Geographic Information System (GIS) is a  main tool for storing, processing and displaying spatial data.

GIS is a good spatial analysis tool, however, with the accumulation of spatial data, the spatial analysis function that GIS offers is not enough. Spatial data mining, which can automatically discover implicit knowledge from spatial data, has recently received wide attentions. Lots of spatial data mining methods and systems have been developed since the 1990s. However, spatial data mining systems are not competent for preprocessing and presenting spatial data. The availability of functions such as spatial and non-spatial query and selection, classification, map overlay, network analysis, and map creation, make GIS a useful tool for spatial data mining [1]. The idea to integrate spatial data mining and GIS, which will produce mature and practical spatial data mining systems, is straightforward.

Several methods that integrate GIS and data mining techniques have been proposed, such as SPIN! [2][3], S-PLUS for ArcView GIS [4] and the method in [5]. The overall objective of the European IST SPIN! project, which integrates spatial data mining and GIS seamlessly, is to develop a web-based spatial data mining system by integrating state of the art GIS and data mining functionality in a closely coupled open and extensible system architecture [3]. It consists of five components: Lava map viewer, Descartes, Geoprocessor, GAM and Kepler, where Kepler is a spatial data mining component and the other four components provide the GIS functions. S-PLUS for ArcView GIS is developed by MathSoft  and ESRI. Functionality includes seamless data export and import between ArcView GIS and S-PLUS, advanced spatial bar charts and pie charts of analysis results and powerful linear regression analysis directly from a menu embedded in ArcView GIS. In [5], spatio-temporal data are preprocessed by GIS before being mined by an association rule mining tool.

The data preprocessing step and the mining step are separately accomplished by two different systems. This is not an ideal method. SPIN! is an excellent spatial data mining system.

However, the integration method is too specific. Besides, S-PLUS is a good spatial statistic tool rather than a spatial data mining system.

In this paper, a novel method is proposed to integrate spatial data mining and GIS. This method is based on Spatial Predictive Model Markup Language (SPMML), a language we extend from Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) [6].

By using this method, spatial data mining and GIS systems can be integrated easily as long as they are conformed to SPMML specification.

This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives a short overview of spatial data mining and introduces PMML.

Section 3 specifies the definition of SPMML. We present the general integration method in section 4 and a prototype system that integrates spatial data mining and GIS with this method is introduced in section 5. Section 6 summarizes our conclusion and gives some directions for our future work.



II. BASIC CONCEPTS  A. Spatial Data Mining Widespread use of spatial databases and the accumulation  of spatial data have lead to the studies of spatial data mining and the development of spatial data mining techniques (or geographic knowledge discovery). Spatial data mining is the process of discovering interesting and previously unknown but potentially useful patterns from large spatial datasets [7]. The spatial data mining patterns include spatial classification, spatial clustering, spatial association rules and spatial outliers and so on.

Extracting interesting and useful patterns from spatial datasets is more difficult than extracting corresponding patterns from traditional numeric and categorical data due to the complexity of spatial data types and spatial relationships [7]. Till now, a lot of spatial data mining techniques have been  This paper is supported by the Major Project of National Natural Science Foundation (40235056).

*Corresponding author: Xie Kunqing Tel.: 86-10-62756920     proposed, such as Co-location Rule [8], Spatial Outlier Detection [9], Predicting Locations Using Map Similarity (PLUMS) [10], Spatial Autoregressive Models [11] and STING+ [12].

The process of knowledge discovery in database (KDD) includes seven steps: data cleaning, data integration, data selection, data transformation, data mining, pattern evaluation and knowledge presentation [13]. Similarly, the process of spatial data mining also consists of these seven steps.

According to [7], the most difficult task of spatial data mining is to transform spatial features into non-spatial features then plug them into traditional knowledge discovery processes. The integration of spatial data mining and GIS focuses on this task and additionally, the result presentation problem.

B. Predictive Model Markup Language The Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML),  developed by Data Mining Group (DMG) is an XML-based language which provides a way for applications to define statistical and data mining models and to share models between PMML compliant applications [6]. DMG is an independent, vendor led group which develops data mining standards. It has 12 full members including the world?s most famous software vendors, such as IBM Corp., Microsoft, Oracle Corporation, SAS Inc., SPSS Inc., and so on. The newest version of PMML is version 3.0 that was released in October 2004. Version 3.1 is currently under development.

The goal of PMML is to encapsulate a model in an application and system independent fashion so that two different applications (the PMML Producer and Consumer) can use it. There are two primary advantages? of? using? the? PMML? standard? in? (extensible)? knowledge? discovery? support?engines?(KDDSE)?and?implementations?of?specific? mining? methods? [15].?

PMML version 3.0 consists of the following components: Header, Mining Build Task, Data Dictionary, Transformation Dictionary and Mining Models. There are 11 Models in PMML version 3.0, including Association Model, Clustering Model, General Regression Model, Naive Bayes Model, Neural Network, Regression Model, Rule Set Model, Sequence Model, Support Vector Machine Model, Text Model and Tree Model.



III. SPMML We propose SPMML to integrate Spatial Data Mining and  GIS. SPMML is designed based on the newest version PMML 3.0 and inherits the advantages of PMML. We extend PMML to SPMML by adding three components which are specific to spatial data mining, including spatial data types, spatial data transformations and spatial data mining models. The definitions of these three components are presented in the following sections.

A. Spatial Data Types Spatial data types are used in the Data Dictionary and  Mining Models components of SPMML. Currently, there are two kinds of spatial data types in SPMML, for vector data model and raster data model respectively. The vector data types that we defined are POINT, CURVE and SURFACE.

PIXEL is for raster data model. Figure 1 is the definitions of POINT, CURVE, SURFACE and PIXEL.

Figure 1.  definitions of spatial data types    Figure 2.  the definition of BI-ATTR transformation  B. Spatial Transformation Dictionary PMML version 3.0 defines various kinds of simple data transformations: Normalization, Discretization, Value mapping, Functions and Aggregation. In SPMML, we add two kinds of spatial data transformation. The first one is SINGLE-ATTR transformation, i.e. transform single spatial  <xs:element name="BI-ATTR">  <xs:complexType>  <xs:sequence>  <xs:value name="method" type="xs:string" use="required"/>  <xs:element name="type" type="xs:string" use="required"/>  <xs:element name="value" type="xs:string" use="required"/>  </xs:sequence>  </xs:complexType>  </xs:element>  <xs:simpleType name='POINT'> <xs:restriction base='xs:long'> </xs:restriction> </xs:simpleType>  <xs:simpleType name='CURVE'> <xs:restriction base='xs:long'> </xs:restriction> </xs:simpleType>  <xs:simpleType name='SURFACE'> <xs:restriction base='xs:long'> </xs:restriction> </xs:simpleType>  <xs:complexType name='PIXEL'> <xs:sequence> <xs:element name='fatherid' type='xs:long'> <xs:element name='rowid' type='xs:long'> <xs:element name='colid' type='xs:long'> </ xs:sequence > </xs:complexType>     attribute to non-spatial attribute (e.g. derive area attribute from polygon attribute.). The other one is BI-ATTR transformation, i.e. transform two spatial attributes to a non-spatial attribute (e.g. derive the ?distance between two points? attribute from point attribute.). To finish the definition of Spatial Transformation Dictionary, these two kinds of transformations are added to the ?EXPRESSION? part of SPMML. Figure 2 is the definition of BI-ATTR transformation.

C. Spatial Data Models Two spatial data models are added into SPMML. They are  Co-location Rule Model and Outlier Detection Model. In this section, we mainly introduce the definition of Co-location Rule Model.

Figure 3.  the definition of COL-LOCATION Model  A co-location is a subset of boolean spatial features. A co-location rule is of the form: C1?C2(p, cp), where C1 and C2 are  co-locations, C1?C2=?, p is a number representing the prevalence measure, and cp is a number measuring conditional probability [9]. Co-location Rule is extended based on Association Rules. The differences between these two patterns are the interesting measure parameters. For Co-location Rule, the interesting measure parameters are prevalence and conditional probability. Hence, the definition of Co-location Rule Model is similar to Association Model except two components. First, the ?AssociationRule? (see [6]) part of Association Model is modified to ?ColocationRule?. Figure 3 presents the definition of ColocationRule. Second, we add three attributes into Co-location Model, including reference  feature centric model, window centric model and event centric model.

D. Transformation between SPMML and PMML The PMML schema contains a mechanism for extending the content of a model. The definitions of spatial data types, spatial data transformations and spatial data models can be placed in the Extension part of corresponding components.

Consequently, SPMML is transformed to PMML. SPMML is a superset of PMML, so PMML model is also an SPMML model.



IV. THE GENERAL INTEGRATION METHOD The original purpose of PMML is to describe statistical and  data mining models. We extend the usage of SPMML to the stages of spatial data transformation, spatial data mining and result presentation. By using SPMML, the integration of spatial data mining and GIS becomes simple. Figure 4 presents the integration of spatial data mining and GIS.

Figure 4.  integration of spatial data mining and GIS  A. Spatial Data Transformation Before the stage of spatial data transformation, an SPMML  format instruction (or file) that describes the spatial data transformation requirements should be generated by the spatial data mining system. Then, the GIS spatial data transformation component transforms the spatial data attributes to user desired attributes according to the SPMML instruction (or file). The transformation results are described in SPMML format too.

B. Spatial Data Mining After the spatial data transformation and ordinary data  preprocessing, this stage extracts spatial patterns from the preprocessed data. The data also can be loaded from the SPMML file. In the mean time, former spatial models can be loaded from the SPMML files too. Finally, the mining results are described in SPMML format.

C. Result Presentation Most spatial data mining models such as Co-location  Model and Outlier Detection Model can not be effectively viewed in other tools except GIS. By adding an XML parser and a spatial data mining model interpreter in GIS, the mining  <xs:element name="ColocationRule"> <xs:complexType> <xs:sequence> <xs:element minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded" ref="Extension"/> <xs:element minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="unbounded" ref="Item"/> </xs:sequence> <xs:attribute name="support" type="PROB-NUMBER" use="required"/> <xs:attribute name="confidence" type="PROB-NUMBER" use="required"/> </xs:complexType> </xs:element>  <xs:element name="Item"> <xs:complexType> <xs:attribute name="id" type="xs:string" use="required"/> <xs:attribute name="value" type="xs:string" use="required"/> <xs:attribute name="mappedValue" type="xs:string"/> <xs:attribute name="weight" type="REAL-NUMBER"/> </xs:complexType> </xs:element>     results that described in SPMML format can be easily presented.



V. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS We integrate our spatial data mining system and SISP (a  spatial database system we implemented based on PostgreSQL [16]) with this method. Figure 5 presents the system architecture of the integrated system. The spatial data mining system consists of four components:   Figure 5.  software architecture of our prototype system  ? Task Manager. It consists of several parts, such as XML parser, SPMML interpreter and so on. It defines the spatial data mining flows and generates SPMML models. It is the most important component of the system which connects the spatial data mining system and SISP.

? Data Adapter. This component loads spatial and non-spatial data and preprocesses the non-spatial data.

? Data Mining Algorithms Library. It accomplishes the spatial data mining tasks.

? Graphic User Interface (GUI). It presents the mining results which need not to be viewed in GIS. It also provides a user friendly interface to setting the parameters of mining models.



VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK SPMML is an XML-based language that describes Spatial  Data Mining Models. It is extended from PMML which is designed for sharing data mining models between different mining tools. Therefore, SPMML has the advantages of PMML. We propose a novel method to integrate spatial data mining system and GIS with SPMML. A prototype system  integrated by using this method is implemented and works well.

In the future, SPMML will be extended to describe the spatio-temporal data models. The spatial data types and spatial data transformations in SPMML will be redesigned too. We also want to add more spatial data mining models into SPMML.
