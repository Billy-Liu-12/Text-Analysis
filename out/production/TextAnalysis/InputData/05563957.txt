Among the  background in image obey Rayleigh distributions, and the tremendous amount of image thresholding tech- niques,  maximum between-cluster variance is modified based on the entropy-based approaches have drawn many atten- tions. Yin      [4] proposed a new method that adopts the parti- cle swann  optimization to select the thresholds based on the minimum  cross-entropy. Madhubanti et al. Usesthe hybrid cooperative?  comprehensive learning PSO algorithm based on maximum  entropy criterion [5].

As a classical image segmentation method, Otsu adap?  tive threshold algorithm has been applied widely in image  processing.Otsu's method [2] had been proposed in 1979,  and it is deduced by least square(LS) method based on gray  histogram. As we all known, this method not only has the  best threshold value in the statistical sense, but also is the  most stable method in the image threshold segmentation at  present. In fact,Otsu's method still deals directly with the  gray-level histogram by parametric techniques, and the his?  togram is approximated in the least square sense by a sum of  Gaussian distributions. Moreover, in many cases, the Gaus?  sian distributions tum out to be a meager approximation of  the real modes.The low-bandwidth Gaussian randomized  procedure will be a more excellent model because of the fre?  quency response of the image transmission and acquisition  system. So the Rayleigh distributions of histogram can be  adopted. ln this paper, we proposed a modified Otsu image  segment method based on the Rayleigh model.



II. THE OTSU'S METHOD  Let the pixels of a given picture be represented in L gray  levels [1; 2; ... ; L] .The number of pixels at level i is denoted by ni and the total number of pixels by N = nl + n2 + ??. ;  +nL.ln order to simplify the discussion, probability  distribution:  n. L Pi =.....!...., Pi ?O' L Pi =1 N i=1  ,Now suppose that we dichotomize the pixels into two  classes Co and C1 (background and objects, or vice versa)by a  threshold at level k ,Co denotes pix- els with levels[l; 2; ... ; k] ,and C1 denotes pixels with levels[k + 1; .?. ; L].Then the   probabilities of class occur- rence and the class mean levels,  respectively, are given by:  , and  where  and  L  OJO = P r ( Co ) L Pi = O1( k ) i=1 L  011= pr(C1 )  L pi=I-01(k) i=k+1  k k ? 'p ('IC) ?. Pi  J1(k) J10 = L.... 1 ri o = L.... 1- = (k) i=1 i=1 Wo W  L L _ ? 'p ('IC ) - ? '. Pi _ J1T - J1  (k) J11 - L.J I r I I - L.J /- - '--_:""""- i=k+1 i=k+1 WI 1 - w(k)  k  O1(k) = L Pi i=1  k  Jl(k) = L iPi i=!

are the zeroth- and the first-order cumulative moments of the  histogram up to the kth level,respectively, and  L  JlT = Jl( L) L iPi i=1 is the total mean level of the original picture. We can easily  verify the following relation for any choice of k:  JlOOJO + Jl101l = JlT, OJO + 011 = 1 The class variances are given by:  1 1  ai = L: (i -110)2 Pr(iiCo) = L: (i - 110)2 Pi i=1 i= I W()  L L  err = L: (i -JlI)2Pr(iiCI) = L: 0-111)2 Pi i=k+1 i=k+1 WI  These require second-order cumulative moments (statis?  tics). In order to evaluate the "goodness" of the threshold (at  level k), we shall introduce the following discriminant  criterion measures (or measures of class separability) used in  the discriminant analysis:    where  a7, = Wo(Po - PT l + WI (PI - PT)2 = WOWI (PI - Po)2 and  L  ai = L (i -,uT )  Pi i=1 are the within-class variance,the between-class variance, and  the total variance of levels, respectively. Then our prob- lem  is reduced to an optimization problem to search for a  threshold k that maximizes one of the object functions (the  criterion measures). This standpoint is motivated by a con?  jecture that well-thresholded classes would be separated in  gray levels, and conversely, a threshold giving the best sep?  aration of classes in gray levels would be the best threshold.

Because the following basic relation always holds:  It is noticed tha a? and a; are functions of threshold  level k,but ai is independent of k. lt is also noted that a? is  based on the second-order statistics (class variances), while  a? is based on the first-order statistics (class means).

Therefore, 17is the simplest measure with respect to k.Thus  we adopt 17 as the criterion measure to evaluate  the "goodness" (or sep- arability) of the threshold at level k.

The optimal threshold k*that maximizes 17 ,or equiva-  lently maximizes a; ,is selected in the following sequential  search by using:   0-2 (k) = lJ1Tw(k) -p(k)]2 B w(k)(l _ w(k)] and the optimal threshold k*is  o-?(k') = maxo-?(k), 1 ? k < L

III. A MODIFIED OTSU IMAGE SEGMENT METHOD BASED  ON THE RAYLEIGH MODEL  A. Image Distribution  The Gaussian probability distribution is perhaps the most  used distribution in all of science. Sometimes it is called nor?  mal distribution and described as:  l ?  j(x) = -- e- 2.0-2 ..;z:rro-  17 =mean of distribution (also at the same place as mode and  median), a2 =variance of distribution,x is a continuous  variable (-00::; X ::; 00 ) .

In many cases, the Gaussian distributions turn out to be a  meager approximation of the real modes. The images could  been described as low-bandwidth Gaussian procedure  through the transmission system. So images could been con?  sidered as the Rayleigh distributions.

We obtain the well known Rayleigh model for the  amp li- tude distribution:  _ x -5-f(x) - 2"e u .l 1?T'  ( T P =mean of distribution (also at x is a continuous vari-able (0 < x).

An image, as a Gaussian procedure, supplies into a low?  bandwidth linearly system, then the output will obey  Rayleigh distributions, and the parameters of these two  model satisfy the following equations:    where 17 and a are mean and variance of Gaussian proce-dure, A is parameter of Rayleigh model.

B. Improvement of Otsu Algorithm  In order to evaluate the "goodness" of the threshold, I  propose the following discriminant criterion measures (or  measures of class separability) used  , where  , and  and the optimal threshold k*is

V. CONCLU SION S  AB 0.1930 0.2132 46.0170  K*   K*   A method to select a threshold automatically from a gray  level histogram has been derived from the view- point of  discriminant analysis. A image will be a low- bandwidth  Gaussian randomized procedure, because of the low?  bandwidth frequency response of the image transmis- sion  and acquisition system, and the object and the back- ground  in image obey Rayleigh distributions. ln this paper, we  proposed a modified Otsu image segment method based on  the Rayleigh model. This directly deals with the prob- lem of    evaluating the goodness of thresholds. An optimal threshold  is selected by the discriminant criterion; namely, by  maximizing the discriminant measure AB . The proposed method is characterized by its nonparametric and unsuper?  vised nature of threshold selection. The range of its applica?  tions is not restricted only to the thresholding of the gray?  level picture, such as specifically described in the foregoing,  but it may also cover other cases of unsupervised classifica?  tion in which a histogram of some characteristic (or feature)  discriminative for classifying the objects is available.So this  method may be used as a simple and standard one for au?  tomatic threshold selection that can be applied to various  practical problems.
