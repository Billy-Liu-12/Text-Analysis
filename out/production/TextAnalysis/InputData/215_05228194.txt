Data Mining and Application of Teaching  Evaluation Based on Association Rules

Abstract? The target of dada mining is to extract the potential, valuable pattern or regulation in the data from a  great quantity. With the fast development of computer net, the  large of data of teaching evaluation is accumulated. The  analysis and processing technology to evaluation data is worse  than data acquisition technology, which does not satisfy the  demand of fairness, justice, objective, scientificalness of  evaluation. In accordance with the multi-dimension relevance  and time sequence relevance of evaluation data, the paper  introduces the application of data mining technology. Taking  the student evaluation as example, the author uses the  modified Apriori algorithm, builds the evaluation index system  based on association rules, and applies theses to the practical  work, and the good effect is got.

I.INTRODUCTION  Teaching evaluation is a process of value judgment and improvement to teaching effect and the realization degree of teaching target according to the teaching target and teaching standards. Ever since a long time, the evaluation of teacher works only focused on quantity, not on quality, which leaded to unscientific evaluation and quantification. There are important theory meaning and practical application value to enhance teaching quality, promote the development of  education that how to scientifically, accurately, objectively evaluate the teaching effect of teachers.

Data mining(abbreviated as DM) is a kind of process of decision support. It gets the potential and useful information and acknowledges from practical application data which is large, incomplete, noisy, ambiguous and random. Data mining relates to extracting a large of data from database, transforming, analyzing and modeling handling these data, and withdrawing the critical data to aid decision making.

Through data mining, some laws, trend and often neglected elements can be found to help decider.

The teaching evaluation to teacher teaching works is an important part of teaching evaluation. Now, teaching evaluation to teacher of most schools mainly contain student evaluation, expert evaluation and faculty evaluation. Among these, student evaluation takes up the maximal part. In the paper, the association rules of data mining is used to mine and analyze the previous student evaluation data, and the scientific evaluation index system can be made, and an evaluation methods based on data mining is developed.



II.DATA MINING ANALYSIS METHOD BASED ON ASSOCIATION RULE  A. Association rules  The mining of association rules is the important research direction of data mining area. Association rules reflect the      inherent correlation among data. To find the inherent correlation of data is helpful to maker to make correct and reasonable decision. Association rules model belongs to description model, and the algorithm to find association rules belongs to Unsupervised learning methods. The data mining of association can be formal described, as shown in the follows:  Given I={i1, i2,?, im} is a collection and made up of m different items. Given a transaction database D, and among it, every transaction is a collection of a group items of I, namely T I has the unique identifier TID. A association rule is an implication formula such as X=>Y, and X I, Y I, X Y= . The conditions of association rules to set up are:  ? It has the support degree S, namely at least there are S% transactions in transaction database to contain X Y;  ? It has confidence level C, namely in the all transactions containing X of transaction database D, at least there are C% transactions to contains Y too.

The basic task of association rules is to mine the strong rule(rules with high support degree and confidence level are called strong rules.). That mining association rules can be divided into two phases: (1) mining big items collection, namely their transaction support degree S is higher than the pre-determined minimum threshold item. (2) using big items collection to produce the association rules whose confidence level C is higher than the pre-determined minimum threshold item in the database. The whole performance of mining association rules is decided by the first phase. After big items collection is decided, the corresponding association rules can be derived. So the key to improve association rules mining algorithm is to effectively calculate big items collection.

A. Apriori algorithm Apriori algorithm is an iterative algorithm to calculate  the specific length of items collection of given database.

First, the algorithm scans the all data of database, calculates the one-dimension frequent data items collection. Second, it uses the frequent data items collection to construct the  possible two-dimensions frequent data items collection (namely candidate data items collection). Third, it scans data again, and calculates two-dimensions candidate data items collection. If the support degree of some candidate data items collection is bigger than the support degree user defined, then the candidate data items collection is considered as two-dimensions frequent data items collection.

The above process is repeated, until the all data items collections are enumerated. The algorithm every scans all data, but in fact the original data often are very large amount, and users only are interest in some data, so we can pre-process the original data. Through analysis, a method using data meeting requirements and useful property to create view can be used to decrease the scanned data quantity, namely only data meeting requirements and useful property  appear in the defined view. The method can be easily realized using SQL language, which lays the basis of enhancing the performance of mining algorithm based on association rules.

B. Improved Apriori algorithm  Because of the large amount of data used in most commercial and scientific fields, so data often are pre-processed. In the improved Apriori algorithm, first view mechanism is used to pre-process the original data, data meeting requirements and useful property are putted into the view. After producing one-dimension frequent data items collection, according to the frequent data items collections of one-dimension and two-dimensions(abbreviated as L1 and L2 respectively ), the properties of database are filtrated to decrease the data propertied and compress the data of database, which lays the basis of enhancing the performance of mining algorithm based on association rules.

The concrete algorithm of the algorithm as follows:  a)   Put the data user cares for into view;  b) Scan view to produce one-dimension frequent data items collection;  c) Use one-dimension frequent data items collection to filtrate the view;  d) Produce the two-dimensions frequent data items collection, and use two-dimensions frequent data items collection to filtrate the view again;      e) Repeat the phase 4 until the all frequent data items collections are gotten.

According to the above viewpoint, we improve the Apriori algorithm, the description as following;  CREATE VIEW view1 AS  SELECT properties user cares for FROM original tables  WHERE  the data user cares for // put the data user cares for into view.

L1 = {large 1-itemsets}; SELECT  the values of properties IN the properties  of  L1 FROM  view1 WHERE  the values of properties IN  L1 // use one-dimension frequent data items  collection to filtrate the data.

? ?  // the new candidate frequent data items collections.

?   //every sub-collection of candidate frequent data items collection.

?  ? ? frequent data items collections.

use two-dimensions frequent data items collection  to filtrate the view;

III.THE APPLICATION OF ASSOCIATION RULES DATA MINING IN TEACHING EVALUATION SYSTEM  A.
