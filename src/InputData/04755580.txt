Evaluation of the Impacts of a Provider-Focused Telehomecare

Abstract   This study presents a pre-post evaluation study of the individual and organizational effects resulting from a provider-focused telehomecare intervention. The project consists of the implementation of a software application aimed at optimizing the organization of clinical activities delivered at patients? homes. Data collection was performed over three periods (one pre- and two post-implementation periods). Nurses were satisfied with the quality of the information stored in the system. The software permitted the allocation of one additional hour to direct patient care, as opposed to one hour less for documentation and paperwork. Eight months after the implementation of the telehomecare application, the number of treated patients increased by 6% (p=.04), the average number of home visits by nurses increased by 0.7 visits per day (p=.02), and the time allocated for direct patient care increased by 14% (p=.003).

1. Introduction   Population ageing is a global phenomenon affecting most of the regions around the world including Canada. As we age, the incidence and prevalence of chronic diseases increase. The burden of chronic diseases on healthcare resources and the resulting costs incurred provide a powerful incentive to find effective ways to care for these patients. The challenge has become even more complex in many developed countries, including Canada in light of the increasing shortage of health care providers, especially outside large urban areas [1].

In this perspective, the provision of care at the  patient?s home has become an alternative patient management approach which can ensure appropriate monitoring and treatment of patients while reducing costs if the appropriate care model and resources are made available. All the Canadian commissions that have examined the problems and challenges faced in the provincial health systems have concluded that providing home care must          become a priority [2-4]. Information technologies (IT) are perceived as key mechanisms by which these changes can be implemented [5-7]. New delivery mechanisms, such as telehomecare ? defined as the application of information and communication technologies to bring health care to the home environment ? are emphasizing care in the home as an alternative to acute care and as a complement to primary care. Given the potential benefits associated with the use of this approach, funding sources, such as the federal Canadian Health Infoway agency, as well as the Canadian provinces and territories, have declared telehomecare a priority in which large amounts of money are being invested to make it a reality [5].

Despite the potential of telehomecare for  improving quality, access and cost effectiveness, there seems to exist a disparity between what we know about telehealth and what we can really achieve in terms of healthcare system improvement [7,8] ? which comes down to what works and what does not work. To address this gap, this paper presents an in-depth evaluation, based on a longitudinal case approach, of the individual and organizational outcomes resulting from a telehomecare intervention implemented in an oncology and palliative care unit in Quebec, Canada.

2. Forms of telehomecare interventions   The continuous increase in health care costs and the shift towards outpatient care have triggered the search for alternative techniques that can keep the patient away from the hospital, while closely monitored. Telehomecare, a particular form of telehealth intervention, can be defined as the use of information and communication technologies to enable effective delivery and management of health services like medical diagnosis, treatment, consultation and/or health maintenance that occur between a patient?s residence and a health care facility or professional. Previous work in this area showed that two generic forms of telehomecare interventions or models are emerging in developed countries.

The first generic type of telehealth home intervention, commonly known as home telemonitoring, is conceived for patients who utilize electronic devices to monitor their clinical conditions. For instance, in a large randomized control trial, cardiovascular patients in the intervention group used telephone-linked home monitoring devices on a daily basis to measure their weight, blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen  saturation level [9]. These patient-focused devices transmit information to a central home telehealth management system which collects, stores, and displays clinical data and assessment documentation. Clinicians then utilize provider- focused information systems to access the data to monitor multiple clients, and provide timely interventions.

A recent systematic review shows that home  telemonitoring of chronic diseases appears to be a promising patient management approach that produces accurate and reliable data, empowers patients, influences their attitudes and behaviors, and potentially improves their medical conditions [10]. There is also clear evidence related to the benefits of home telemonitoring at the clinical level, and specifically, for patients suffering from hypertension and diabetes [11,12]. Subsequently, telemonitoring systems have become an important progressive approach in health care, which involves creative user-friendly technologies that empower patients and support monitoring of their health status from home.

A more recent telehomecare intervention  model, which is the focus of this evaluative study, targets home care health providers as its main users. This second generic type of telehealth home intervention is mainly a tool for ensuring effective management and care delivery. While the former generic type of device allows data monitoring and intervention at a distance, the second type allows clinicians to integrate the care process on site at the patient?s home. In this perspective, the second generic type allows patient clinical data management on site, visit scheduling, care planning and data sharing with the care team [13].

These devices (personal digital assistants, notebooks, tablet PCs, etc.) can access clinical information from a distance or update the patient record or care plan in real time. The objectives of this mode of intervention are mainly to achieve greater productivity among the clinical staff and improve the quality and continuity of the care provided through better clinical management.

Contrary to home telemonitoring, we are not  aware of any empirical study which has attempted to formally assess the impacts of provider-focused telehomecare interventions on healthcare organizations, care providers and patients, and this is where the present study makes a contribution.

From home and monitored from  a distance  Anywhere (mostly from the patient?s home, the clinic, and on the road)   In summary, the two telehomecare models  seem complementary and similar in that they both originate at the patient?s home and are aimed at supporting the care process. However, they have different underlying modalities in terms of how they function. Table 1 synthesizes these similarities and differences. Any information gathered is related to the patients and any resulting intervention also targets them. Regardless of who enters the data, the patient or the healthcare provider, the technologies in question revolve around patients and providing quality care.

3. Methodology  3.1 Overview of the site and context   The telehomecare project assessed in this study was carried out in an oncology and palliative care  unit in Quebec, Canada. The unit provides health care services to the region's cancer patients. Most of the unit's services are provided in the home and have been delivered by seven registered nurses and four physicians. The nurses' role is to visit patients in their homes in order to make assessments of their health status, provide the care they require, document each intervention (including the nursing plan) on a paper-based cardex system and, finally, update the therapeutic care plan. The physicians' role consists essentially of caring for and providing support to end-of-life patients, providing pain relief and pronouncing death.

Since its creation, the care unit has witnessed a  marked increase in the demand for services in an environment characterized by an aging population, labor shortages and ever tighter controls over health spending. At the start of the project, the unit served 200 patients and received between 12 and 15 requests for home care services per week. The unit's assistant head nurse evaluates and approves requests for services and assigns nurses to the established schedule of home visits. In order to be able to respond to the rising demand for services, the unit's management uses the services of additional nurses from private agencies, a solution that is very costly to the health facility.

Prior to the deployment of the new software  solution, a nurse visited three to four patients in a typical day, with each visit lasting approximately 40 minutes. As few as two visits could be made per shift when a nurse visited new patients (opens new files) or visited patients in their terminal phase. In both cases, their interventions naturally take more time. After visiting patients, the nurses usually return to the unit in the beginning of the afternoon to document their morning's work and plan the following day's visits (e.g., determining their needs in terms of medical supplies and equipment). The care unit has a computerized system for entering and storing patient identification data and information on service requests, but it is not used as a clinical information system. Clinical documentation is handled by a manual system that relies on a dozen different paper forms. This has created an administrative burden and problems related to duplication of effort and poor information availability.

3.2 Description of the intervention   In 2006, the unit?s management team decided to invest in a project that would reduce the time being spent in clerical tasks, particularly          documentation, so that more home visits could be completed per shift and patients could receive better care from the oncology and palliative care unit. The hospital's administrators were not alone in feeling that reform was needed; the unit's nurses, who would be the main people affected, also felt that they needed more modern work tools.

A $300,000 budget was allocated to the  project, which was officially presented to the nursing and medical staff on April 16, 2007. The core of the project was an implementation of the SyMOTM software application from PG Govern.

This computer application optimizes the process by which the clinical activities taking place in patients' homes are organized. More specifically, it captures clinical data on patients at their source and immediately sends the information to the other care providers involved. Management decided that use of the new system would initially be limited to the main group of care providers involved, i.e., the nurses. The application was deployed at the start of June, and each nurse was provided a tablet PC with a stylus.

SyMO has several distinct modules. It has a  dictionary of interventions as well as a dictionary of typical intervention plans. Using the Intervention Plan module, the nurse enters the list of actions to be taken with the patient. The Case Load module is used to assign patients to care providers. Once a patient has been assigned to a care provider, the Schedule module automatically plans the visits required according to a pre- determined visit rate. The nurse may at any time make changes to a schedule proposed by the system. System access is either asynchronous (using the data stored in the tablet PC) or synchronous through the network mode (from the unit) or a VPN (virtual private network) connection.

3.3 Data collection   A pre-post research design was developed to measure the scope of the effects associated with the deployment of the SyMO application.

Outcomes of interest were nurses? satisfaction with the software application as well as individual and group productivity. With regard to productivity, the main objectives were to increase 1) the number of patients treated by all the nurses involved in the program, 2) the average number of home visits made by a nurse per shift, and 3) the percentage of time nurses spent providing direct care to patients. It must be noted that there was no  intention to reduce the number of home visits made to individual patients.

Three successive periods of data collection  were planned in order to assess all of these effects.

The first observation period was focused on the pre-deployment period (August 2006 to May 2007). The analysis also covered two post- deployment periods in the 8 months following project deployment. The first post-deployment period (Post 1), from July to October 2007, dealt with the short-term effects of the new system.

Finally, a second post-deployment period (Post 2), from December 2007 to February 2008, covered the medium-term effects associated with using the SyMO application.

We collected data using three different types of tools: 1) semi-structured interviews, 2) structured questionnaires, and 3) managerial reports. First, a total of 18 interviews were conducted to evaluate changing perceptions in terms of system quality, satisfaction and perceived effects on individual and group productivity. Excerpts of the interview guides are presented in Appendix A and B.

Interviews were conducted with five nurses and three key project stakeholders, namely, the project manager, the champion, and the analyst and information resource manager. As shown in Table 2, interviews were conducted at three different times: at the end of May 2007 (Pre Deployment), in mid-October 2007 (Post 1) and at the beginning of February 2008 (Post 2).

Table 2. Number and distribution of interviews Pre Post 1  Post  Interviews with nurses - 4 (5) 3 (5)  Interviews with team members 4 (3) 3 (3) 1 (2)  Interviews with hospital managers 2 (1) - 1 (1)  Total number of interviews 6 7 5  The numbers within parentheses represent the total number of participants. Both individual and group interviews were conducted.

The interviews were conducted face-to-face in  the participant?s office and all interviewees were informed of the confidentiality of the information they shared with the researchers and signed a consent form. Both individual and group interviews were performed.

In order to triangulate the observable effects, we also asked the nurses to complete a structured questionnaire dealing mainly with their use of SyMO and its perceived effects. This questionnaire was distributed twice: once in the middle of October 2007 (Post 1) and again at the end of January 2008 (Post 2). All seven of the nurses completed the questionnaire at Post 1, and six of them were able to return a completed questionnaire at Post 2.

Finally, we captured and analyzed the data  provided by the hospital's information management system on client care at four different times: August-September 2006 (the Pre-1 period), January-February 2007 (the Pre-2 period), August- September 2007 (the Post 1 period) and January- February 2008 (the Post 2 period). The data allowed us to examine the effects of the intervention on the productivity criteria presented above.

3.4 Data analysis  First, all of the interviews were recorded and transcribed, resulting in 158 pages of verbatim transcript. The contents of each interview were coded according to the nurses? perceptions of the new software solution (system adoption, satisfaction, and effects on individual and group productivity). Qualitative data were reduced using matrices and tables as suggested by Glaser and Strauss [14] and Miles and Huberman [15].

Second, questionnaire data were analyzed using descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation) as well as t-tests to check for differences between the pre- and post-deployment periods. Since survey instruments were mainly developed to collect data that would either confirm or refute our interpretation of the interview material, i.e. for triangulation purposes, no reliability and validity tests were performed. In any case, results of such tests would have been difficult to perform and interpret given the very small number of respondents. The survey instruments used before and after system deployment are available from the first author upon request. Third, quantitative data provided by the hospital?s information system was analyzed using descriptive statistics and OLAP cubes in SPSS version 15.0.

4. Results   This section presents detailed information on the findings of the evaluative study. The  information is in two distinct sections: 1) nurses' attitudes toward and satisfaction with the SyMO application and, subsequently, the use they were making of it; 2) the perceived (subjective) effects associated with system use in terms of individual and group productivity.

4.1 Nurses? satisfaction with and use of the  new software solution   As mentioned above, the software was deployed in June 2007, a few weeks before summer vacations, such that when their vacations began, the users had not fully climbed the learning curve. Their return to work in August was therefore not easy in terms of system use. Several of the nurses and the care unit's management reported that SyMO was not being rapidly picked up when the nurses' returned to work. Some of them even mentioned that they wanted to return to their former habits, meaning documenting their work on paper. This problem was exacerbated by the fact that the personnel assigned to provide system support were not present when the nurses returned from their vacations.

Table 3. Nurses' satisfaction with the SyMO software application    Mean (SD) on a Scale of 1 to 10*  Post 1 Post 2 Do you feel that the SyMO system in your unit: Is easy to use? 7.9 (1.1) 8.7 (1.2) Requires computing knowledge that you already have? 7.1 (1.2) 8.3 (0.8) Is clear and understable? 7.4 (1.4) 8.3 (1.2) Rarely goes temporarily offline? 8.1 (0.7) 7.9 (1.3) Has a rapid response time? 6.6 (1.5) 7.3 (1.5) Overall mean 7.4 (1.2) 8.1 (1.2)   Do you feel that the clinical information contained in SyMO is: Reliable and valid? 8.7 (0.8) 8.0 (0.4) Complete? 8.1 (1.1) 8.2 (1.0) Relevant? 8.3 (1.0) 8.5 (0.8) Readable and understandable? 8.9 (1.2) 9.2 (1.0) Presented in a clear and useful format? 8.4 (1.5) 8.7 (1.2) Safe and confidential? 8.4 (1.3) 8.2 (1.6) Available when you need it? 7.3 (2.3) 8.5 (0.8) Overall mean 8.3 (1.4)  8.5 (1.0) * 1 = strongly disagree and 10 = strongly agree    However, by the beginning of September 2007  continued improvements to the system were having a very positive effect on motivation levels among the nurses. Only three months after SyMO deployment (the Post 1 period), the same nurses were reporting high levels of satisfaction with the computer tool. Interviews held in the beginning of February 2008 (the Post 2 period) revealed that the overall level of satisfaction with the software application had again risen above levels reported for the previous period. Overall, the users found that the tool was user-friendly and powerful and that it provided high quality information (see Table 3).

Eight months after system deployment, all the nurses were using the therapeutic module as a          valuable checklist when performing patient assessments and therapeutic interventions. Almost all of them were entering their observation notes directly in the home, although one of the nurses still preferred waiting until she was in her car as she did not like documenting her visit in the presence of the patient and/or spouse. However, not one of the nurses was systematically updating her patients' care plans in the home. Rather they performed this task at the end of the day, since the care plan could only be reactivated from the hospital when making the assessment.

Even though the data in Table 3 show that  levels of satisfaction with the system and the quality of the information it contained rose slightly from the Post 1 period to the Post 2 period, the change did not prove to be statistically significant.

A possible explanation might be that only minor improvements were made to the system between the Post 1 and Post 2 periods.

4.2 Effects of SyMO on individual and  group productivity   As shown in Table 4, the nurses indicated that since SyMO had been introduced they were spending one hour more per shift providing direct care. The averages calculated from respondents' estimates (self-administered questionnaires) indicate that the time spent on direct care grew from 3 hours and 24 minutes (before system deployment) to 4 hours and 20 minutes (after deployment, Post 1) to 4 hours and 24 minutes (after deployment, Post 2). The difference recorded between the Pre and Post 2 periods was not, however, found to be significant (t=-2.2; p=.079).

Table 4. Perceived Effects of SyMO on Individual Performance  Pre Mean (SD)  Post 1 Mean (SD)  Post 2 Mean (SD)  Time spent per shift on direct care (in hours and minutes)  3hr 24min (54 min.)  4hr 20min (30 min.)  4hr 24min (48 min.)  Number of home visits per shift 4.2 (0.4)  5.0 (0.6)  5.1 (0.2)  Time spent on documentation per shift (in hours and minutes)  2hr 15 min (36 min.)  1hr 9min (18 min.)  1hr 18min (14 min.)    Directly associated with this finding, the  number of patients visited during a shift had also increased since system introduction. The nurses who had completed the questionnaire reported visiting an average of 4.2 patients before using SyMO, compared to 5.0 patients in the Post 1 period and 5.1 patients in the Post 2 period. This difference between the Pre and Post 2 periods was statistically significant (t=-9.0; p=.003). In summary, the nurses reported that they were  visiting one more patient per shift since SyMO had been introduced.

According to the questionnaires, the nurses'  travelling time remained relatively unchanged.

Mean travelling time in a typical work day fell from 54 minutes (the Pre period) to 48 minutes (the Post 1 period) and then rose to 65 minutes (the Post 2 period). The differences were not statistically significant. However, it must be remembered that the average nurse was visiting one more patient per day after the system was deployed, which implies travel to one more patient's home per shift for each nurse surveyed. The gain in travel time per visit between the Pre period and the Post 1 period was therefore significant, falling from 13 minutes to less than 10 minutes per visit. The change observed between periods Post 1 and Post 2 is mainly attributable to the difficult winter conditions in Quebec in early 2008.

SyMO implementation also resulted in a  dramatic reduction in the amount of time spent documenting care. While the time spent on this task averaged 2 hours and 15 minutes per shift before SyMO was introduced, it was now 1 hour and 18 minutes (t=-3.8; p=.02). Here again we need to remember that more patients were being visited per shift. Approximately 32 minutes were spent per file documented in the Pre period, as compared to 16 minutes per file in the Post 2 period. In summary, the trends observed in the Post 1 period were confirmed in the Post 2 period. It would appear that the SyMO deployment allowed the nurses to spend an extra hour per shift providing direct care, and one hour less on documenting their work.

Next, we asked the nurses about SyMO's effect  on the overall performance of their care unit. In particular, we asked about the level of communication achieved between nurses and between the nurses and the unit's physicians, as well as the quality and continuity of care provided to patients. The results on perceived organizational benefits are shown in Table 5.

Table 5. Perceived benefits at the departmental level To what extent has deployment of the SyMO system had a positive effect on the following?

Mean (SD) on a scale of 1 to 10*  Post 1 Post 2  Communication between unit nurses 7.1 (1.8) 7.0 (1.3) Communication between nurses and physicians 5.9 (1.2) 6.2 (2.1) Time spent providing direct patient care 7.4 (1.7) 7.8 (2.1) Time spent proving patient care or treatment 6.4 (0.9) 6.0 (2.5) Quality of care provided to patients 7.3 (1.4) 8.0 (1.5) Continuity of care 8.6 (1.0) 8.7 (1.2) Quality of the nurse-patient relationship 6.3 (1.7) 7.2 (1.8) Appropriateness of nursing interventions 8.1 (1.1) 8.5 (0.8) Overall mean 7.1 (1.5) 7.4 (1.7) * 1 = very negative effect and 10 = very positive effect          We observed that eight months after system introduction, the perceived benefits in terms of the individual performance appeared to be greater than the perceived benefits for the group as a whole.

One possible explanation for this finding is that up until this point the implementation strategy had focused on appropriation of the technological tool by individuals rather than on group benefits.

Furthermore, the fact that the physicians were not yet using SyMO may also explain the modest results in terms of improved communication between the care unit's nurses and physicians.

As a final step, we compared the nurses? perceptions using objective data obtained from managerial reports. We obtained managerial reports for four 28-day periods: two periods preceding the SyMO deployment (12 months and 6 months before deployment) and two periods following system deployment (3 months and 8 months after deployment). We used the same weeks of the year in order to control for seasonal variations.

Based on the results in Table 6, we were able to  draw a certain number of conclusions concerning the actual benefits eight months after the SyMO deployment. First, system use increased the number of patients treated, which rose from 211 (in the Pre periods) to 223 (in the Post periods). Since the total number of days worked was virtually unchanged after the SyMO deployment, this change represents a 6% net increase in the number of patients treated (t=-2.3; p=.04).

Second, we observed that the average number of home visits made by a nurse during her shift also rose; if we compare the data from periods P1 and P3 (August-September), we see that the average number of home visits made by a nurse per shift rose by 0.5 visit (t=-2.2; p=.04). The results are even more significant when we compare periods P2 and P4 (January-February), since the increase was approximately 0.7, on average (t=- 3.1; p=.02). In addition, we note that the average number of home visits continued to rise from the third to the eighth month of use, at a rate of 0.4 visit. This finding is even more encouraging, given the fact that new case referrals (which require creating patient files, a task that is considerably more time consuming than a regular case management visit) peaked in the Post 2 period, when they represented 60% of all active patients.

Table 6. Effects of SyMO on Individual and Group Productivity  Pre-deployment Post 1 Post 2 Period P1 Period P2 Period P3 Period P4 Number of active patients 101 110 115 108 Number of new cases 48 62 37 65 New cases / number of active patients 48% 56% 32% 60%  Number of regular nurses (# of days) 9 (68) 7 (95) 7 (60) 6 (95) Nursing assistants (# of days) - 1 (2) 1 (1) 1 (2) Number of agency nurses (# of days) 3 (24) 4 (4) 3 (31) 1 (5) Total number of days worked 92 101 92 102  Availability for direct care (# of days) * 87 96 87 97  Number of home visits 311 368 361 438 Number of visits / active patient 3.1 3.3 3.1 4.1 Average # of visits / nurse / shift 3.6 3.8 4.1 4.5 Average visit length (in minutes) 44 42 47 47  % time spent in direct care 44% 43% 52% 57% P1=Aug 19 to Sept 15 2006; P2=Jan 7 to Feb 3 2007; P3=Aug 19 to Sept 15 2007; P4=Jan 8 to Feb 2 2008.

* This corresponds to the number of days available for direct patient care. It has been estimated that 5% of a nurse's total working time is spent in other activities, including discussing cases and other meetings, training, recovering and returning patient files from archives, and entering data on their interventions in their unit's computer system. The average number of visits and the percentage of time spent in direct care have been calculated on the basis of the time available for direct care.

Third, we examined the system's effect on the  percentage of time the nurses spent providing direct care to patients. If we compare the data from periods P1 and P3 (August-September) and those of periods P2 and P4 (January-February), we see a significant increase in the percentage of time spent providing direct care: 8% (t=-3.7; p=.015) and 14% (t=-4.9; p=.003), respectively. In summary, eight months after system deployment the nurses were spending 57% of their time providing direct care to patients. It should be noted that among the data collected from questionnaires at the end of January, the nurses indicated providing an average of 4 hours and 24 minutes of direct care per shift. This represents slightly more than 60% of their total work time. In terms of data triangulation, we found very high convergence between the objective data (from the managerial reports) and the perceptual data (from interviews and questionnaires).

Finally, it is worth noting that the use of private  nursing agencies did not fall after the SyMO system was introduced. Again comparing the data from periods P1 and P3 (August-September) with those from periods P2 and P4 (January-February), we see that the percentages associated with the number of days worked by nurses from private agencies remained relatively unchanged. In addition, we see that the effect of SyMO had not yet been felt in terms of the expected reduction in the number of overtime hours. One possible explanation may be the fact that many regular nurses worked in the two post-deployment periods (a total of 13 nurses) as compared to the two pre- deployment periods (a total of 16 nurses). It should also be noted that this type of structural effects may take months to appear.

5. Discussion   In light of the ageing of the population and the increasing pressure on health care systems, a new form of telehomecare, which allows clinicians to integrate the care process on site at the patient?s home, appears to be a promising approach for increasing nurses? performance as well as patient accessibility to care services.

This study presents an evaluation of the  individual and organizational effects resulting from a provider-focused telehomecare intervention implemented in an oncology and palliative care unit in Quebec, Canada. The longitudinal nature of the study, which allowed a pre and post evaluation, and the triangulation of the data collection methods used allowed rigorous analysis of the results and represent a significant strength of this research.

The analysis of the qualitative and quantitative  data allows us to make certain observations. First, in terms of adoption, the nurse users were quickly able to adapt to and adopt the new system. They showed a positive attitude toward the system and were satisfied with the quality of the information stored in the system, which appeared to be of great value for recalling patient information during a visit. According to the nurses, the clinical information system increased the completeness and quality of their interventions in the patient home, mostly in terms of patient assessment, treatment, and education.

Second, after eight months of system use  significant gains were observed in terms of the number of home visits and, indirectly, the time spent providing direct patient care. However, we should mention that most of the nurses we interviewed appeared to believe that the number of home visits would only be maximized once the system would be able to update the information in real time and through remote access. For this purpose, approximately seven months after SyMO was deployed, remote system access was provided to two nurses who lived a considerable distance from the hospital. These nurses were then able to download patient data in their homes at the start of the day and begin their visits with all the relevant and current information in hand. Before this change, these nurses made their home visits without the benefit of all the most current information on their patients, such as state of health, recent changes to their medication, etc.

Finally, in terms of productivity we observed a significant increase in the number of patients treated by all the nurses (p=.04), the average number of home visits made by a nurse per shift (p=.02) and the percentage of time spent by nurses providing direct care (p-.003). In sum, the main advantages of the SyMO system from the point of view of nursing staff appear to be increasing the number of patients treated (access), increased home visits (access), spending more time with patients (efficiency) and less time spent on documentation (efficiency).

For the administrative authorities at the  hospital, the success of the SyMO project also lays in the quality and continuity of care provided to patients. We intend to evaluate these important outcomes in the coming months based on a series of semi-structured interviews with patients, nurses, and hospital managers.

In short, despite the positive results obtained, it  is important to note that continuous assessment of the effects of the provider-based telehomecare intervention over a longer period of time is important to monitor the progress of the project.

Future replication of this type of analysis, with larger samples of providers and in other settings, would further strengthen the conclusions and allow better generalizability of these findings.

6. Conclusion   Introducing the SyMO software application in an oncology and palliative care unit represents a significant organizational change. This change had positive effects on staff productivity as well as on accessibility to care services. The success of this project required a sustained commitment from the decision makers involved (the hospital administrators and managers on the care unit), a considerable change management effort from the members of the project team, and close collaboration with the informatics supplier.

Although nurses represented the main category  of health professionals targeted when SyMO was introduced, the system may eventually be used by other professionals ? in particular, physicians ?, and this should accentuate the gains in terms of quality and continuity of care. It should also be pointed out that collateral gains in terms of fewer visits to hospital emergency rooms and hospitalizations are expected in the long term as a consequence of better case management and better ongoing care for this client group. According to the        hospital's administration, such gains clearly represent savings to the hospital.

Finally, we cannot overlook the potential for  improved quality of life for the key stakeholders ? the patients ? in terms of a reduction in the emotional and financial traumas associated with hospitalization and being separated from their families and homes. Future research needs to be conducted to assess the extent to which this novel form of telehomecare intervention has a significant impact on patients? quality of life.
