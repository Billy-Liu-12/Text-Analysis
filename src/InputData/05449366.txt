Estimation of Wind Power Variation and Availability  for Multiple Wind Farms

Abstract?Due to its intermittent nature, integrating large quantities of wind power in power systems has serious impacts on power system operation. Wind power increases the load variation and the reserve requirements for contingencies. Utilities are especially concerned about the wind power availability during the peak load demand time. In this paper, the wind power variation and availability for multiple wind farms distributed in Wyoming, Colorado, and New Mexico are analyzed based on actual wind data. Considering multiple wind farms as part of one big wind farm distributed over a large area can decrease the wind power variation and increase the total wind power availability.

I.  INTRODUCTION Smart Grid is defined differently by many countries and  areas. However, reliability is concerned by all of them, especially when a large amount of renewable energy is connected to the grid. Wind power is an intermittent resource which varies continuously. The main concern about wind power is that there is not enough spinning reserve in the system when wind stop blowing, which may result in blackout in high wind power penetration cases.

Wind energy can provide a part of the electrical demand, but consumer cannot rely completely on wind powered electric energy because it is not available all the time.

Conventional generators, such as coal-fired and hydro plants, have nominal ratings and their operational output can move between minimum and maximum rating freely. However, wind turbines are different from them because input wind speed is not controllable as steam or water flow. The output of wind turbines follows the wind speed when the wind speed is between the cut-in and nominal speed of the wind turbines.

Therefore more reserve capacity is needed when more wind turbines are integrated into the power system. Reference [1] reviewed some analytic and utility case studies cases on the impacts of wind power on existing power systems. There was not a definite conclusion given in [1], however, it showed that the integration costs increases with size as integrating wind power requires more reserve. The cost becomes more with higher penetration.

Fig. 1 is the 50-meter wind resource map of the United States [2]. The darker color represents higher wind speed.

National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has a database on wind speed of western areas in the U. S. [3]. 10- minute average wind speeds were saved in this database.

Three measurement station IDs in [3] are used in this paper: 15518, 10868, and 5471, which are A, B, and C in Fig. 1, respectively. Wind power correlation and availability of multiple wind farms and their combination will be analyzed based on wind speed data of these three locations in this paper.

II. WIND POWER CORRELATION AND VARIATION Cross-correlation is used to measure the correlation  between two time series, and it is defined as [4]:  ,  1 ( )( ) n  i i i  x y x y  x x y y nr  ? ? =  ? ? =  ?  , where, x, y are the point of the time series, x , y  are the averages, ? is the standard deviation and n is the number of points of the time series. If the time series x and y depart, then rx, y is near -1. If the two time series follow the same trend, then rx, y is near 1. If the time series are not correlated, then rx, y is near 0.

A  B C       The cross-correlations shown in Table I are calculated based on 10 minute wind speeds. A, B, and C are in Wyoming, Colorado, and New Mexico, respectively. The distances of AB, BC, and AC are about 300 km, 400 km, and 600 km, respectively. In this paper, summer and winter are defined as from May 1 to October 31 and from November 1 to April 30, respectively. The wind data from May 1, 2005 to October 31, 2006 is analysis in this paper. In Table I, all the numbers are positive except cross-correlation between A and C in summer, which means any of two time series are correlated except A and C. Locations A and B are more correlated than other pairs, possibly because they are geographically closest amongst all the locations. Location A and C are least correlated perhaps due to the fact that they are farther apart.

One is that unpredictable wind power can increase the load variations and forecasting errors dramatically [1].

This is true for large individual wind farms with high capacity, but if the capacity is distributed throughout many locations, the variation might not be as big as an individual farm [5].

Assume the capacity of each location is 30 MW, so the combination is 90 MW. The output power of wind turbines can be estimated via the power curves given by their manufacturers. In this paper, GE 1.5SLE is used. Its power curve is shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 3 shows hourly average wind power at the three locations and their combined effect. The capacity of each location is scaled from 30 MW to 90 MW which is the total capacity of the three locations, then the standard deviation of each location with scaled capacity can be compared with that of the combination.

The output power of the combination is the average of the three locations, but its standard deviation is reduced from that of the individual three. All three locations are not completely correlated, so they can cancel parts of the variations of each other, therefore, its variation is overestimated as far as the impacts on the system is concerned. Currently the impacts of wind farms on the power system are studied as individual farms.

III. WIND POWER AVAILABILITY For this study, let us assume no scheduled outage or  maintenance in the wind farms. The generation only depends on the local wind speed, i.e., the wind turbines will produce electricity if wind speed is between the wind turbines? cut-in and cut-out speeds. The output of wind turbines will follow      their power curves. The wind turbines used in this paper are GE 1.5SLE and its power curve is shown in [6]. Its cut-in, rated and cut-out speeds are 3.5 m/s, 14 m/s and 25 m/s, respectively [6].

10 minute average wind speeds for four days of summer (July 30 to August 2, 2005) and winter (January 30 to February 2, 2006) are plotted and shown in Fig. 4. From the 10 minute average wind speeds of all locations, it can be found that the wind speeds of the three locations are seldom below the cut-in speed (3.5 m/s) and above the cut-out speed (25 m/s) at the same time. In other words, these locations are able to partly compensate each other?s no wind condition due to geographcal dispersion.

Fig. 5 shows the wind power availability (the time of wind turbine producing power over the total time during this period) of each location and their combination. The percentage of time wind power is unavailable (wind speed lower than 3.5 m/s or higher than 25 m/s) is from 12.73% to 16.90% in summer and from 9.05% to 17.08% in winter for an individual location.

Transmission system operators have to increase the reserve requirements to backup the wind power when a new wind farm is connected to the grid. Bigger wind farms need higher reserves. But if multiple wind farms are considered, the wind unavailable time decreases. The percentage of wind unavailable time is 0.71% in summer and 0.13% in winter when the three locations are considered together as one big wind farm distributed over a large geographical area.

The 5% wind power available time of the better location (A) is about 7% less than that of the combination in winter (Fig. 5). The 5% wind power available time of the lower location (B) is 79.87% in summer.

Therefore, much more generation resources have to be  reserved for each wind farm. However, if all the three locations are considered, the 5% wind power available time (5% of total capacity of all the three location) is increased to 96.72% in summer and 98.96% in winter.

IV. CONCLUSION Wind availability of a single wind farm is low, but if a  number of wind farms distributed over a large distributed area are combined and looked at as a whole generation resource, then the availability of wind power increases. Real wind data from three locations in western areas in the United States is used in this paper. Compared with each location, the combination of the three locations can increase the wind availability and decrease the wind power variation. The spinning reserve for wind power could be reduced if multiple wind farms distributed over a large geographical area are considered as one large wind farm.
