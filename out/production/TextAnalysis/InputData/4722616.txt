I.   INTRODUCTION  Energy saving and consumption reducing is the inevitable choice for enterprises to adapt the market competitive. So, under this situation, enterprises always meet the difficulty in optimum parameters choice-making, namely how to realize the optimal result of production-run efficiency at the minimal cost. In essences, this is a parameters optimization problem.

In order to solve this problem, this paper firstly lists some main production-run parameters which decide the height of energy consumption. Because among those parameters, some are in good or better situation, they are not provided with the optimization value; but, some are in bad or worse situation, so, they present the optimization space. Therefore, this paper applies the factor analysis to evaluate the energy consumption level of each parameter.

The low efficiency parameters need to be optimized, therefore, this paper introduces the fuzzy association rule mining to optimize these parameters and determine the  optimal parameters values, so as to improve the production-run efficiency, save energy and reduce consumption.

Last, a power plant case is presented to illustrate the actual effect of the proposed model and show the rationality and feasibility of this method.



II.    THE APPLICATION OF FACTOR ANALYSIS  The general models of Factor Analysis can be  expressed as follows: suppose 1X ? 2X ? ? pX  are the  measurement indexes of a certain problem,  ix ( 1, 2, , )i p=  is the standardized value of  iX ( 1, 2, , )i p= . All the indexes are dominated by  ( )m m p<  factors, each index is restricted by a  particular factor, so, ix  can be linear expressed by  Factor F and particular factor u, namely:  1 1 2 2 ( 1, 2, , )i i i im m ix a F a F a F u i p= + + + + =  ?1?  In order to obtain the relative easy explained result, make combined factors F revolute to G, so, model (1) is turned into:  1 1 2 2 ( 1, 2, , )i i i im m ix b G b G b G u i p= + + + + =    ?2?  No matter Model (1) or Model (2) makes the indexes   DOI 10.1109/CSSE.2008.966     a linear combination of combined factors. Factor Analysis also can express the combined factors as a linear combination of indexes, thus, the combined factors values can be estimated by the indexes? observed values, the values are intituled factors scores, namely:  1 1 2 2 ( 1, 2, , )j j j pj pG x x x j m? ? ?= + + + =    ?3?

III. THE APPLICATION OF FUZZY ASSOCIATION RULE MINING Input: the transactions data base composed with n transactions, each transaction is composed with m items; where the membership grade function sets, the  item j(j=1?2? ?m) in transaction i(i=1?2? ?n) can be  described by k membership functions: ( )i jsR?  (s=1?2?  ?k). Presetting the minimum support s and minimum confident c.Output: a set of fuzzy association rule.

1) Using the given membership function to describe  each item jit ?j=1,2, ,m?of every transaction data iT  ?i=1,2, ,n?in transaction data base D as a fuzzy set.

Given the fuzzy set jit corresponds is j  if , thus, j  it can be  described as jif = 1 2  1 2  ( ) ( ) ( )i j i j i jk j j jk  R R R R R R  ? ? ? + + +  Where jlR  is the lth fuzzy subfield of item j  it , i? ( jlR )  is the membership grade value of subfield jlR .

2) Calculating the jsweight of each item j  it  ? j=1,2, ,m ? in n transactions data  iT ( 1, 2, , )i n= corresponds the fuzzy set  jsR ( 1,2, , )s k= : jsweight =  1 ( ) n  i js i  R n  ? = ?  3) For each subfield jsR ?1 ,1j m s k? ? ? ? ?,  checking whether the jsweight of each fuzzy set greater  than or equal to the preset minsup. If subfield  jsR satisfies the said qualification, it can be put into the  frequent large set 1L , namely:  1L ={ jsR / jsweight minS? ?1 ,1j m s k? ? ? ? }  4) Given r=1, where r is the items ?number of the frequent large set.

5) Producing the candidate items set 1rC + from the  frequent large set rL by using the similarly Apriori?  method, there are r-1 items are the same in two item-sets, while others are different, and two subfields which belong  to one item can?t appear in a same item of 1rC + .

6) For each new generated r+1 item  set 1 2 1( , , , )rt t t t += of 1rC + , we can dispose as follows:  a) For each transaction data iT , calculating the  membership grade of candidate large item set t thereon it.

it? = 1 2 1( ) ( ) ( )ri t i t i tR R R? ? ? +? ? ?  Where ( ) ji t  R? is the membership grade of  transaction iT in subfield jtR .

b) Calculating the weight of every item in candidate  large item set.

1 n t it  i weight  n ?  = = ?  c) If tweight greater than or equal to minS , put  item 1 2 1( , , , )rt t t t += into 1rL + .

7) If 1rL + is empty, executing the next step;  otherwise, set r=r+1 and repeating step (5) to (7).

8) Constituting the association rule for all the large  item sets t which have items? 1 2, , , qt t t ? ( 2)q q ? .

The procedures are as follows: a) Formatting all the possible fuzzy association rules  1 1 1k k q kt t t t t? +? ? ? ? ? ? ?k=1,2, ,q  b) Calculating all the confidences of fuzzy association rules  1 1 1    ( ) k k q  n  it i  n  it it it it i  ?  ? ? ? ? ? +  =  =  ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ?   9) Outputting the rule which the confidence greater than or equal to the minimum confident.



IV.   CASE STUDIES  A.  Evaluating the Efficiency of the Power Plant? Main Production-run Parameters by Using Factor Analysis  This paper takes a power plant?s 300MW generator set as the example. These generator set has been running from  1970?s, and it is relative newer, running efficiency is relative higher, while if some advanced methods are used, the efficiency may have farther enhancing, the power plant still has the space of energy saving and consumption reducing. In order to reduce the running cost, the relative higher energy consumption parameters should be optimized. Table 1 lists all the original data of the power plant?s energy consumption parameters, Using Excel software to standardize the original data, and then using SPSS software to evaluate the high/low of the factors? energy consumption.

From the results, we can see that F2 and F4 are excellent, and they needn?t to enhance, while, the indexes of F1 and F3 are not so good, if we want reduce the running cost of the power plant, we should enhance the indexes as follows: Main steam pressure, Main steam temperature, High-enrichment input rate, Air leakage rate of preheater air, Coal-fired lower calorific value, Vacuum degree, and Exhaust smoke temperature.

Optimizing the High Energy Consumption Parameters by Using Fuzzy Association Rule Mining  Analyzing the late 3 months historical running data of the selected set, 4136 set steady-state running data used for mine association rule can be obtained by data selecting and data checking.

Standardizing all the attributes of the data set to [0 ? 1]. Fuzziness every parameter?s attributes, the Membership function is shown as figure 1, the gradient and distributing of triangle are determined by each vector?s discussion rage combining the actual system?s characteristics. Among them, fuzzy subset of the language variables were expressed as VN (very low), N (low), NM (normal), P (high), VP (very high). Fuzziness the data set?s basic data, and then making the fuzzy data as the  input vector. Given the minimum support mins =0.3,  minimum confident minc =0.75, using fuzzy association  rule mining to determine the aim value of the main controllable parameters, so as to optimize the set?s production-run.

?  0.5  1.0  0.1 0.3 0.5 0.7 0.9 1.0  VN N NM P VP    Figure 1?Membership function     Make mining the optimized aim value of exhaust  smoke temperature in the load of 100% as an example to do  specific analysis (Exhaust smoke temperature is the main  parameter which influences current supply coal consumption).

Make the fuzzy set data which satisfy the  steady-state  operation records in load of ?298-300MW?as the object of  fuzzy association rule mining, the intensive association rule  can be obtained by fuzzy association rule mining:  ,1 , ,0.20,0.30g gM b< > < >?  ,0.64,0.68gT< >  ?s=46%,c=81%?  Where gM expresses the load, gb expresses  current supply coal consumption rate, gT expresses exhaust  smoke temperature. The support degree is 46%, the  confident degree is 81%. If the association rule satisfies the  qualification that it is greater than or equal to the minimum  support and the minimum confident?s> mins ?c> minc ?, it  can be said as intensive association rule. Inversing  fuzzification, then we can obtain:  , 298,300 , ,326,330g gM b< > < >?  ,145.6,147.2gT< >  ?s=46%,c=81%?  The association rule above indicates that when current  supply coal consumption relative lower (less than 328g/kw.h),  the best space of exhaust smokes temperature is  145.6-147.2 C?  in load of 100%. The aim value is  selected in the best space, this paper selects the median as  the aim value, and then obtains the best value of the  exhaust smokes temperature 146.4 C?  in load of 100%.

C.  Achievements of Optimizing Parameters? Values  Fuzzy association rule mining makes the late production measured data as the basic data, the optimized aim values can be achieved, so it can reflect the actual running conditions.

Making the optimized aim values as the setting values, and then making the closed loop experiment, the result indicates that the economical efficiency of the set enhances obviously, boiler efficiency enhances 0.28% on an average, and current supply coal consumption rate reduces 1.6 g/kw.h on an average, the emission of air contaminant also be reduced.

So it has grate economic effects and social effects.
