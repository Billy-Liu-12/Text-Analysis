Non-linear Correlation Discovery-based Technique in Data Mining  LIU Bo

Abstract In this paper, a novel technique was present for mining complete correlation itemset, named as NLCD(non-linear correlation discovery) from hereon.

In the first, it employ the vertical representation of a database, and then to find the direction between the correlative itemsets with fast processing and lots of them through the whole, including many kinds of correlation. Transaction ids of each itemset are mapped and compressed to discrete bool sequence.

Lastly it was evaluated the algorithm against algorithms LCD using a variety of data sets with short and long frequent patterns. Experimental report showed that the NLCD algorithm outperforms.

1. Induction  Association rules mining[1,2] has been studied more and more widely in the field of data mining recently.

R.H.L.Chiang e.t. presented a data-processing model[3] based on linear correlation discovery(LCD), which combined statistics and data mining techniques.

This model improved on the association rules mining and it has four advantages as follows:  The semi-atomization of grouping the data attributes according to the analysis of schema information; Creating the attributes sets of potential linear correlation; Applying a set of heuristic rules to determine the most appropriate correlation measurement function to measure each potential induced linear correlation; Confirm the discovered correlations through repeating the same measurement on subsequent data samples to reject the artifact discovers.

Here the term ?linear? refers to the assumption that all attributes with an attribute group are independent of one another and their effects are therefore additive, and the term ?correlation? refers to the proportion of explained variance between two attribute groups and attempts to determine whether  the dispersion(variance) of values in one attribute group can predict the dispersion in another. So LCD has implement the automatization of discovering the correlative rules between the attribute groups and mend the notation and the technique of association rules mining based on the min-support-certainty. This model has important application in the real-world data mining and it is a representative kind of technology.

While the correlation between pair-wise attribute groups can be mined by LCD, there were most directions of these correlations that are very difficult to discover by the normal statistic technique through can not be ignored. At the same time, we should be aware how these correlations are working, i.e. knowing how and the degree of these correlations. But these problems cannot be solved through model of LCD.

We have put forward the notation and quantifying-method of the holistic correlation analysis[4].

In this paper we will upswing it and present non-linear correlation discovery algorithm(NLCD), which having four contributes as following: (1). Using non-linear technique to analysis and quantify  the correlation between the attribute groups; (2). Adopting the data presentation of bool serial, this  method can map the original data into bool serials and get the easily processing object data;  (3). Applying the holistic correlation analysis into the non-linear analysis and quantifying of the correlation;  (4). Using non-linear technique to settle those problems above, and the experiment evaluation showing our model NLCD is efficient than LCD.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a detailed describing of the non-linear correlation and others associated. Section 3 introduces the NLCD algorithm and analysis its astringency. Section 4 shows a detailed experimental evaluation of NLCD on datasets from different domains and compares it against existing algorithms. Finally, Section 5 provides concluding  International Symposium on Intelligent Information Technology Application Workshops  DOI 10.1109/IITA.Workshops.2008.30     remarks and the works in the future.

2. The background notation In this section, we will give out the notation  needing later, including the conception of correlation and especial correlation, such as holistic correlation and non-linear correlation.

2.1 The conception of correlation Here we give the criterion notation on the  association rules mining: let I={i1,i2,..,im} be the itemset, and the D be a database of transactions, a transaction T containing itemset I if and only if I?T.

The support of an itemset I, denoted (I), is the number of transactions in which it occurs an as subset.

Then association rule is a condition of the form A  B(p, q), where A I B I and A B=? ? ? ? , if this rule  is true in D when it satisfies two conditions: 1. The support of this rule q= (A B) is no less than  || ||  D BA?  ; 2. The confidence p= )(  )( A  BA ?  ? ? is no  less than ||  || A  BA? .

In our paper we mainly think over the quantitative and qualitative correlation between the attribute sets, i.e. discovering the correlative rules having a certainty amount correlation between the attributes or attribute sets. Supposing M is a matrix with n objects and m attributes, here let bool sequence express all the attributes of the object i: I(o)=(i1,i2,..,im)I, where i  {0,1}(k=1,2,?,m) showing whether the object o possesses attribute k(when i =0, indicating do not; when i  =1 do); in the same way, let bool sequence express all the objects possessesing the attribute i: O(a)= (o1,o2,..,on)a, where o {0,1} (k=1,2,?,n) showing whether the object k possesses attribute a(when o =0 indicating do not; when o  =1 do). Let One(x) be the number of ?1? in the bool sequence x, and Zero(x) be the number of ?0? in x.

We define the correlation function of bool sequence (x,y):f(x,y), where x and y being t-dimensional bool sequences, i.e.

x= ),( 21 txxx ? o1  y= ),( 21 tyyy ? o2  and  f(x,y)= yx?~ Here the signal ?~  is the logic ?and?  operation on the bit, such as the table2-1: Table 2-1bit operation  ?~ 0 1 0 1 0  1 0 1  According to this function we can define some kinds of correlation between the bool sequence x and y(supposing 0 t) x and y is complete positive correlative if and only if One(f(x,y))=t; denoted { o1, o2| xt+ } ( or { o1, o2| yt+ });x and y is k- positive correlative if and only if One(f(x,y))=k; denoted { o1, o2| (x, y)k+ };x and y is complete negative correlative if and only if Zero(f(x,y))=t; denoted { o1, o2| (x, y)t- };x and y is k- negative correlative if and only if Zero(f(x,y))=k; denoted { o1, o2| (x, y)k-}.

Similarly, we can extend f(x,y) into multi-parameters: such as x1=(x11,x12, ,x1t), x2=(x21,x22, ,x2t),, , x2=(x21,x22, ,x2t),  ),,,( 21 nxxxf ? = nxxx ???~ ~ ~21 ?     (1)  Also we can define complete positive correlative k-positive correlative complete negative correlative k- negative correlative, here leaving out.

Some explanations to be made out: the type of the correlation between the attribute sets is determined by checking the number ?1? of correlation function value, when any two bool sequence are the same, we can get that  all the bits of yx?~  is ?1?, meaning their direction of  the changing is consistent, so we define it as complete positive correlative, likely to the k-positive correlative complete negative correlative k- negative correlative.

Given the bool sequences of transaction data, they can be partitioned as X1,X2 such as Xi ? Xj=  ?  xiX? 1,x2, ,xn nji ?? ,1 , j  To measure the degree of the correlation, we define the frequency of the correlative sequences in the transaction data set as  || ||  D X  the bigger , the stronger this degree of the correlation, or else, contrarily.

2.2 The conception of especial correlation including holistic and non-linear correlation  Here the conception of especial correlation comes from the paper of Bo. L. e.t.[4]. Most methods to the correlative analysis recently are mainly based on statistical technique, considering the unite probability distributing. However the holistic correlation analysis(HCA) technique uses non-linear measurement to quantify the whole correlative factors of the object, and then confirm the degree of the correlation.

Now giving out the formalization of the holistic correlation: supposing the correlative factors set is C={C1,C2, ,Cn}, according to the correlation function f(x,y), we can find the correlative coefficient  of each pair correlative factors ij? =f(Ci,Cj), and then  give their non-linear holistic correlation algorithm  operator :  kF ?  ),,,( 21 kk xxxF ? ? =  (3) )),,,,((? 1211 kkk xxxxFF ? ?  where =),(? yxF )()( 22 yxyx  ,  ( ) denoting all the ix kx ??1 ij? , such as  . This operation is non-linear and  more prominence than others  kxxx ??? ?21 [4]. The outstanding  merit of this technic is that it can fix on the holistic correlation and avoid relapsing into the local correlation.

3. NLCD algorithm(non-linear correlation discovery algorithm)  To illuminate the algorithm of NLCD, we use an assumptive data, for example seeing the table 3-1.

Where TID meaning the mark of each transaction, ATTRIBUTES meaning the attributes of the transaction(including A1 A9). After scanning the data for the first time, we can get the corresponding bool sequences(seeing table 3-2), the process done later mostly based on this bool table.

We have two pieces of elicitation from those discussing above: 1. we can get a partition of the given sequences set  according to one kind of complete positive correlation;  2. one kind of k-positive correlation set can determine corresponding (9-k)-negative correlation set.

Non-linear correlation discovery(NLCD) algorithm combines the virtue of HCA and LCD technique, and adopts non-linear correlation analysis technic. While NLCD overcomes the shortage that LCD can only describe the correlation between the attributes qualitatively.

In the algorithm of NLCD, data are present by the bool sequence and resident in the main memory, so saving the I/O run time. When the data are too much we partition them properly and run the program group by group.

NLCD can deal with the non-linear correlation between transaction attribute sets easily. Now we present the algorithm of NLCD:  /*NLCD algorathom.*/ In addition, when the data are present the search space is fixed, so much the workload to discovery the correlation between the attribute sets. Hence the NLCD algorithm is convergent and valid to process those problems debated above.

4. Experiments In this paper our experiment environment is in the  personal computer of Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4, 1843 MHz-CPU DDR512MB-memory Win-XP system and all program are compiled by C++. We make use of two synthesize data sets[5](T15I5D100k and T25I10D10k), which taking on feeblish correlation. Also we use a public data set(Connect-4) with strong correlation. these data specification is showing in The table 4-1. Here we run our algorithm NLCD compared with LCD and get the experiment result, putting out the reports as following:  Table 4-1 experiment data  Candidate transaction set Sc={all}; For all data Translating into bool sequence;  //generate total positive correlation sets.

While(Sc?? );  k=0; Select x Sc, for all y  Sc if((x,y)= =sizeof(x)),then delete x,y from Sc,and put them into Sk;  k++; //generate non-total positive ones.

From table 4-2 we can include that the algorithm  NLCD has four excellences compared with LCD as following: ? In the aspect of runtime, for all three data sets  algorithm NLCD is faster than LCD evidently, the improving rate being about 33.1% through computed;  ? Considering the correlative sets discovered in the experiment, there are much more correlative sets discovered in NLCD than LCD, more approximately 38%;  ? In the facet of type of the correlation discovered, algorithm LCD can not subdivide the correlation set into complete positive sets and non-ones more slender, but NLCD can do that: getting more types of correlation such as complete positive correlative k-positive correlative complete negative correlative k- negative correlative;  ? Through those kind of correlation in the algorithm .NLCD we can find the direction of influence between any correlative attribute sets, for instance, the changing direction of the complete positive correlation sets is consistent but that of complete negative ones is oppositive.

Above all, in despite of feeblish correlation of the data and of strong one, algorithm NLCD is excelled compared with LCD, such as fast speed much more types of correlation sets and being capable of raveling out the  direction of influence.

5. Conclusions In our article we discussed the new algorithm of  non-linear analysis and quantization of holistic- correlation (NLCD) in the whole correlated items. And we also applied it into the real transactional data. This  method can be applied in many fields, especially in the valuating credit risk and correlation mining. But there are much more technique needs to study in the future and we now are addressing this work. These are several tasks to be treated with: ? The work of data pretreatment; ? Discussing of the presentation of the relationship  among the relative items; ? The deep studying the complexity of the whole  algorithm; ? Designing the model of the optimizing.
