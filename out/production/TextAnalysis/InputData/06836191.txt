Using Physics of Failure to Predict System Level  Reliability for Avionic Electronics

Abstract Today's analyses of electronics reliability at the system level  typically use a "black box approach ", with relatively poor  understanding of the behaviors and performances of such  "black boxes" and how they physically and electrically interact.

Box level analyses tend to use simplistic empirical predictive  models, and the effort is typically driven by cost and time  constraints. The incorporation of more rigorous and more  informative approaches and techniques needs to better  understand and to take advantage of the advances in user  interfaces and intelligent data capture, which will allow for a  broader range of users and for similar resource allocation.

Understanding the Physics of Failure (PoF) is imperative. It is a  formalized and structured approach to Failure  Analysis/Forensics Engineering that focuses on total learning  and not only fixing a particular current problem. It can involve  material science, physics and chemistry; also variation theory  and probabilistic mechanics. The approach necessitates an up?  front understanding of failure mechanisms and variation effects.

In this paper we will present an explanation of various physical  models that could be deployed through this method, namely,  wire bond failures; thermo-mechanical fatigue; and vibration.

We will provide insight into how this approach is being accepted  by system assemblers, as it allows for failure oriented  accelerated testing, for substitution or "what if" analyses in lieu  of the traditional accelerated life testing. This paper will also  provide insight into a process to develop viable test plans and a  tool that facilitates the entire process so that minimal testing is  performed, thus reducing costs and schedule impacts. Examples  of this approach will be presented.
