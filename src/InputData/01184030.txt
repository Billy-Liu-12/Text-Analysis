Mining Associated Implication Networks: Computational Intermarket Analysis

Abstract  Current attempts to ana/yze international financial markets include the use offinancial technical analysis and data mining techniques. In this paper, we propose a new approach that incorporates implication networks and association rules to form an associaled nefwork struclure.

The proposed approach explicitly addresses the issue of local vs. global influences betweenfinancial markets.

1. Introduction  Conventional wisdom has it that financial markets around the globe are interrelated. To cite an example, commodity prices and the U.S. dollar move in an opposite direction. This kind of intermarket actions can be further divided into two perspectives. In a local perspective, various markets in a certain country, such as stock, currency and bond markets, interact with each other.

While in a global perspective, the same kind of markets (e.g. U S .  stock markets and other stock markets in the world) tends to be highly correlated. Current attempts to analyze international financial markets include the use of financial technical analysis and data mining. These efforts, however, do not make a clear distinction between the local and global perspectives of intermarket actions. In this light, we propose a new paradigm to analyze these intermarket actions by mining probabilistic networks and association rules. The discovered networks and rules form an associated network structure in which the distinction of local and global perspectives becomes possible.

1.1. Related Work  In our approach, we employ probabilistic networks to formulate interactions in a global perspective. Some traditional examples of inferring schemes over probabilistic networks are presented in Charniak's [3] work.

A number of algorithms were proposed to derive probabilistic networks. More modern works in this field include Liu and Desmarais [ 5 ] ,  which proposed a method of learning implication networks from empirical data.

Myers et al. [7] proposed a method of learning Bayesian networks from incomplete data using evolutionary  0-7695-1754-4102 $17.00 0 2002 IEEE 689  jiming@comp. hkbu.edu. hk  algorithms.

2. Associated Network Structure and its Discovery  Liu and Desmarais [SI proposed a method for learning implication networks from a small number of empirical data samples. This approach emphasizes on inference accuracy rather than the actual topology corresponding to a knowledge structure.

Association rules are used for the proposed approach to connect the networks. As pointed out by Bowes et al. [2], causal inference algorithms extract relationships that are always stronger than association rules, because their elicitations are based on rigid statistical testing. The tests, however, are sometimes too rigid that some subtle hut novel rules would he rejected during the testing process.

Association rules, on the other hand, often represent more novel (e.g. support can be as low as 0.1, depending on the nature of the domain) but useful relationships. We, therefore, use a combination of these two techniques to form an associated network structure.

In summary, the components of an associated network structure are illustrated in Figure 1.

2.1. Discovery of an Associated Network Structure  As pointed out by Liu and Desmarais [5], six types of implication relationship exist between any pair of nodes,  http://hkbu.edu http://hkbu.edu   i.e. A 3 B, A = -B, -A B, -A 2 -B, A 0 B and A t) -B. The elicitations of these implication relationships are based on statistical examinations, which are referred to as hypothesis tests on empirical data [4].

The hypothesis testing works as follows: For any implication relation A 3 B, the following two conditions must be satisfied:  P( B I A )  = I P(-A I -B) = I  (1) (4  The hypothesis testing examines Conditions ( I )  and (2) by computing the lower hound of a (I-aJ confidence interval around the measured conditional probabilities.

This would allow the elicitation of implication relationship become possible under sampling errors.

The implication induction algorithm of Liu and Desmarais [5] is stated as follows:  Liu's aodpesmanL' h ~ l i & t i d n ~ t n d o ,. . B e i n  ,. .. . .  - set a significance level (4  pmbabilityp* for anclwork . .

Associated with each established relationship are weights representing the certainty of the relation. In order to facilitate the later inferences, the weights are estimated during the network structure discovery phase.

Theoretically, two weights are associated with each type of implication relationship, as an inference can be made  either in forward or backward direction. The weights are estimated from the empirical data samples. Specifically, the estimated conditional probability of the relation is used as the weight.

In our proposed approach, the Apriori algorithm [l][S] is used to mine the association rules. The nodes in each implication network are regarded as the items for the algorithm to generate itemsets which are required by the rules. After the itemsets are generated, rules with minimum confidence pc and support s are discovered.

Note that in our proposed approach, it is only desirable to have association rules which connect different implication networks but do not connect the nodes in the same network. After the induction of implication networks and the mining of association rules, an associated network structure is ready for uncertainty reasoning purposes, such as analyzing intermarket actions.

3. Empirical Validation on Financial Market Analysis  In order to validate our proposed approach, we analyze several markets with an associated network structure discovered from empirical market data.

Murphy [6] points out the existing key relationships between the financial markets around the globe. Among others, there are four principal interrelated market sectors, namely currencies, commodities, bonds and stocks.

Besides, interest rates also play a significant role in affecting the markets.

We are interested in finding out the relationships between the aforementioned markets. If the markets are correlated, some empirical data samples of these markets can be used to discover a proposed network structure which reflects their relationships. The empirically derived network structure can further he used to analyze the trends of the involved markets.

3.1. Settings for the Validation Experiments  The actual settings in our validation experiments are as  Financial Market Selection. With reference to the key intermarket relationships defined by Murphy [ 6 ] , markets from the four principal market sectors from the United States and Japan are selected. Selected indexes for the markets are as follows:  follows: 1.

U.S. Market a) USDIndex: b) CRB Index; c) Federal Reserve Fund Rate; d) IO-Year Treasuly Bond Yield; e)  0 Japanese Discoum Rate;  Dow Jones Industrial Moving Average; Japanese Market     g) Nikkei 225 Stock Average; h) il IO-Year Benchmark Bond Yield; jl  Japanese Yen Red Effective Exchange Rale;  Composite Index of Business Indicators  2. Preparation of Empirical Data Samples. Since the case study aims at investigating the long-term relationships of the selected financial markets, monthly data is chosen for the experiments. The data collected is within the period of December 1982 to December 2001 inclusively. The data gathered, however, is only in a form of numerical values. In the current study, we are interested in the relationships between the markets, e.g., if the greenback goes down, the commodities go up.

Therefore, it is necessary to define what is ?up? and what is ?down? before any actual experiments can be carried out. Therefore, data has to be preprocessed to show the up and down trends of the markets.

The empirical data samples are further divided into a training set for the discovery of an associated network structure and a testing set for analysis and validation. In the case study, the training set includes empirical data samples fiom November 1983 to November 1992 inclusively. The testing set includes those from December 1992 to December 2001 inclusively.

Discovery of an Associated Network Structure.

As pointed out by Murphy [6], the local financial markets influence each other more than the international markets do. In this connection, two implication networks will be generated: one for the US. market and one for the Japanese market. The implication relationships within implication networks show the stronger influences between the markets in a local perspective, while the association rules linking up the two implication networks show the weaker relations between the international markets. The significance level n, and a minimum conditional probability pn,,, for the implication networks are 0.2 and 0.5 respectively. The minimum confidence pc  and minimum support s for the association rule mining are 0.6 and 0.1, respectively.

3.2. Experimental Results  This section presents the discovered network structure, and the analysis and validation results using the mined associated network structure.

3.2.1. The Discovered Network Structure  With the empirical data samples from the training set, the following implication networks representing the US.

and Japanese financial markets can be discovered (Figure 2 and 3).

3.2.2. Association Rules Connecting the Networks  AAer the induction of the two implication networks, the selected financial markets are used to generate itemsets for mining association rules. The following association rules can be mined with the empirical data samples from the training set with the mining algorithm as stated in Section  Rule 1 :  (Japanese Benchmark Bond Yield Increases/Decreases) 4 (U.S. IO-Year Trearury Bond Yield IncrearedDecreaser) Rule 11 {Japanese Benchmark Bond Yield Increases/Decreases) + (U.S. CRE Index Increaser/r)ecreasc) Rule 3: {Japanese Cornposit Index of Business Indicators Decreasedlncreaser) + (USD Index Decceasedlncreaser) Rule 4: {Nikkei 225 Stock Average Decrearesllncreases) + ( U S 0  Index Decreascdlncreases) Rule 5: (Nikkei 225 Stock Average Decreaseshereaser.

3.2.3. Experiment to Evaluate the Overall Analysis Performance  In this experiment, two nodes from the U.S. markets are randomly picked from each monthly empirical data sample as observed evidence. When the observed value is TRUE, a belief value of 1 is given to the node; if the observed value is FALSE, a belief value of 0 is given. The beliefs of the other nodes in the two implication networks are revised accordingly with the implication relationships and association rules. When the updated belief value of a node is larger than 0.5, a TRUE value is assigned to the node, or vice versa. The estimated values of the updated nodes are further compared to the actual values in the same empirical data samples in the same month. Meanwhile, we record the total number of correct and incorrect guesses within the implication network corresponding to the US .

financial markets, as well as the total number of correct and incorrect guesses using the association rules and the implication network corresponding to the Japanese financial markets. The above process is repeated five times, that is, five cycles. For each cycle, all the 109 monthly empirical data samples in the testing set are used.

The mean of the analysis accuracies using the U S .

market implication network is 58.4671%, with a standard deviation of 1.8453%. For the other nodes in the Japanese market implication network, the mean of the analysis accuracies is 66.6799%, with a standard deviation of 5.4041%. In general, the accuracies of analysis using the entire discovered network structure remain stable, with the mean accuracy 61.2508%, and a small standard deviation of 1.604%.

3.2.4. Experiment to Investigate the Effect of the Number of Observed Nodes on Analysis Performance  In this experiment, the number of nodes observed as evidences is controlled. The experimental procedure is similar to that in the preceding experiments, except the number of observed nodes which will be different. The means of the analysis accuracy with the U.S. markets implication network are 59.91%, 58.47% and 55.74% when I ,  2 and 3 node(s) idare observed respectively.

Surprisingly, the mean accuracy decreases slightly as the number of nodes observed increases.

4. Conclusion  This paper has presented a novel approach to analyzing financial intermarket actions with a combination of  implication networks and association rules. The experiments show that the proposed analysis approach is able to model international financial markets with an automatic means of discovering an associated network structure.

The experiments further demonstrate the analysis ability of our proposed associated network structure. It is believed that the innate weakly correlated nature of the financial markets is accountable for the low accuracy. The stability of the proposed approach, however, is remarkably high (standard deviation of 1.604%).

One surprising result is that the analysis accuracy decreased as the number of observed nodes increased. The reason, subject to further examination, is that multiple-path traversal is allowed in the multiply connected implication networks in our study. An interesting extension of the present work, therefore, would be to investigate the optimal traversing method for implication networks.
