Application of Apriori Algorithm to the Data Mining of the Wildfire

Abstract Traditional methods for forest fire forecast applying the weather data is only used to prediction for a administrative division of province level, and it is not favorite to the forest farm level, for there is not accurate forest fire with lacking of forest fire monitoring. In this theme, Apriori, an association rule algorithm, is applied to analysis the probability and intensity of the forest fire effectively with coarse forest fire data. It makes the forest farms possible to predict the forest fire applying the coarse weather data.

1. Introduction   With the rise of the temperature in the world wide, the hazards of the wildfire increase too. The funds for preventing the forest from the fire are increased in most countries in order to make the fires under control.

However, the future is still not inspired the fireman. The reason is that, the principle of the fire broken in forest still has not been grasped now for there are so many factors that can induced the fire and they may be too complexes.

The methods utilizing the weather factors only can be used to forecast the trends in province level at a long period, and it cannot be used to direct the fireman to make plan in details.

In this theme, a complex system research method is introduced to predicate forest fire, and the predicate result is expected can work well and benefits the making of the fire prevention plan in details [1-4].

The research area is located in a forest area belonging to Fangshan Forest Bureau in the south of Beijing, and has a north temperate and monsoonal climate. There is more rain and torrid in summer and it is cold and dry in winter. In spring, it is droughty and windy, while it is bright and clear in autumn. The average temperature is between 10? and 12? , however it is 10.8? in the northwestern mountainous district, and the forest-free days is about 150 days, while in the southeastern it is 11.6?, and the forest-free days is about 200 days. The average annual precipitation is 655 mm, and the rainfall is mainly from June to August, accounting for about 85% of the whole of the year, the rainfall is greater in intensity, while it is always hail and very windy.

The main vegetation in this region is the deciduous broad-leaved tree living in the warm temperature, and little of them are coniferous forest. The dominant species are Quercus Liaotungenesis, cork oak (Quercus variabilis BL.), white birch(Betula platyphylla), maple(Acer mono), Dahurian Birch(Betula dahurica), aspen (Pobulus davidiana), Acer serrulatum, white wex (Fraxinus chinensis ), Chinese pine (Pinus tabulaeformis Carr ) and arbor vitae (Biota orientalis) et al.

2. Research methods   2.1. Data Resource  The meteorological and forest fire data of this district  from 1986 to 2007 are provided by Fangshan weather bureau and Fangshan Forestry Bureau. The weather data were preprocessed adopting value-insert algorithm to   DOI 10.1109/FSKD.2009.228    DOI 10.1109/FSKD.2009.228     improve precision with the extra data collected from 2003 to 2006 [5-9], and these data are used to draw the courter map of the weather as figure 1; the fire data are calibrated through other methods, such as investigating the retired fireman, surveying the burns, et al., after the calibrating, a fire location map can be draw as figure 2.

All the data could be catalogued into two kinds, one of them is the field data, and the other kind is vector data. The database should be divided into three kinds, one of them is weather factors database, and the others are the forest fire field database and the terrain database. The weather database includes many attributes such as time, temperature, moisture, wind speed and rainfall. These databases are named after the  weather station from which the data is collected. The attributes of the forest fire database include the fire location, the burn area, the time finding the fire, the time putting out the fire, the number of the people and vehicles, the fire ground database attributes include time, coordinate and temperature. Every kind of files is named with the time and the data kind, for example, a file named ?2004forestry? means that file contains the forest data in 2004. The terrain picture database is a kind of database not needing to modify its attribute values due to the fields used to plant tree could not be changed in a very long time, the maps included are terrain map, drainage map, stock map and forest division map, et al.. These map are made from the vectorized map added some attribute values.

The data set used in the research is a subset extracted from the whole data set with SQL [10-11].

2.3. Apriori Algorithm   Quantitative data must be converted into qualitative  data, for the association algorithm only can process the later one. The transform procedure is as follow, first, the wanted data are got from database with SQL, then the data are divided into two kinds, one is that the fire number is zero, and the other is not, at last, the dataset, which number is zero, will be divided further, from which the maximum and the minimum will be got, and the difference value is divided by 3, so all the data are divided into 3 groups according to the quotient, and each group will be set a value as high, medium or low. All the records in the subset have been divided into four kinds according to its fire number, that is often, sometime, rare and none.

These data is processed with the Apriori Algorithm, and some rules between the weather factors and the wildfire are got.

Apriori is a kind of association rule algorithm which often be used to mine the Boolean dataset [12]. The principle is implying the prior knowledge about the dataset to search the dataset successively in iterates, to explorer the k+1 items with k items.

The algorithm could be decrypting as fellow: .Connecting step: to create k items dataset by self connecting with L(k-1).

.Pruning step: C(k) is a hyper set of the L(k), if a k-1 items of the dataset does not exist in the k items dataset, then this item must be delete. It will create a nonblack  subset for each frequency dataset created by the connecting step.

Applying the Apriori algorithm in R [13], the  association rules between the forest fire and the weather factors are analyzed, and some rules are got as the table 1.

Table 1. Rules between the wildfire number and the weather factors  Rule number Antecedent Consequent  (Fire broken? ) confidence  1 Rainfall=low  Y 1 2 Moisture=low Y 1 3 Moisture=low and rainfall=low Y 1 4 Air temperature=mid Y 1 5 Air temperature=mid and rainfall=low Y 1 6 Wind speed=mid Y 1 7 Wind speed=mid rainfall=low Y 1 8 Moisture=low wind speed=mid Y 1 9 Moisture=low wind speed=mid rainfall=low Y 1  10 Wind speed=low Y 1 11 Wind speed=low rainfall=low Y 1 12 Temperature=high Y 1 13 Temperature=mid moisture=low Y 1 14 Temperature=mid moisture=low rainfall=low Y 1 15 Temperature=high rainfall=low Y 1   The table 1 show that, in the 402 records, all values of  the rainfall are low, there are 272 records, the values of the moisture are low, among which there are 271 records those attribute value of the rainfall are low; there are 235 records which value of the temperature is mid and the moisture are low, 205 records which value of the wind speed is mid and the rainfall is high, 156 records which wind speed is mid and the rainfall is low, there are 155 forest fire when the wind speed and the rainfall is low, there are 143 records which temperature is high while 142 records which rainfall is low, there are 143 records which temperature is middle, rainfall and moisture low.

3. Conclusions   The conclusions can be got after analyzes those association rules above.

Temperature is the first essential element which affected the wildfire, there is not fire breaking while the temperature is low, when the temperature is middle, the fire can break when the moisture is low, however, if the temperature is high, the fire will break out only if the rainfall is low. The temperature value of the most records is middle.

Moisture is a constrained factors but not a crucial one.

There is no fire when the moisture is not low.

In all the records there are fires breaking, the common character is less rainfall, it is a constrained factor. When the rainfall is more than 2.5 mm, there are no fire records.

When the wind speed is more than 4.5 m/s, there is no fire record too.

The association rules are test and verified with the regression analysis on the dataset. The result is as the formula 1.

0.0248y x=             (1)  In the express 1, y presents the rainfall, its unit is centimeter, and x stand for temperature, its unit is centigrade.

The relationship between the temperature and the moisture is as the formula 2.

0.493 40.90y x= ? +     (2)  In the express 2, y presents moisture, its unit is centimeter, and x represent temperature, its unit is centigrade.

The relationship between the moisture and the wind speed is as formula 3.

0.044 4.047y x= ? +     (3)  In the express 3, y presents the wind speed, its unit is m/s, x presents the moisture, and its unit is percent.

From the discussion above, a conclusion can be formed that if the fire data is not precision, even there are a lot of is missing, and some valuable rules still can be got from the qualitative description. Such methods would be help for the small establishment to prevent the fire.
