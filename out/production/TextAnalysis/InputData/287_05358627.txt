Mining Strongly Associated Rules

Abstract   One of the main tasks of KDTCM (knowledge discovery in Traditional Chinese Medicine) is discovering novel paired or grouped drugs from Chinese Medical Formula Database. Paired or grouped drugs, which are special combinations of two or more drugs? have strong efficacy. Association rule mining is used by reason of the large number of association relationships among various kinds of drugs. However, association rules reflect only one kind of association relationships and thus have less significance in TCM researches. In this paper, we propose to mine strongly associated rules, which have much more probability than association rules to be novel paired or grouped drugs because of strongly associated relationships between both sides of a rule. Experimental results on Chinese Ancient Medical Formula Database and Traditional Chinese Medicine Herbal Database show that all techniques developed in the paper are efficient and effective.

1. Introduction   Confronted with the increasing popularity of TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) and the huge volume of TCM database, such as CMF (Chinese Medical Formula) database and TCM Clinical database, there is an urgent need to explore these resources effectively by the techniques of knowledge discovery in database (KDD).

Since paired or grouped drugs, which are special combinations of two or more drugs, have strong efficacy, discovering novel paired or grouped drugs becomes one of the hot topics in TCM researches. In CMF database, there are many association relationships among various kinds of drugs. Therefore, in order to extract novel paired or grouped drugs, we usually use association rule mining to learn these association relationships among various kinds of drugs [1, 2]. However, from the definition of an association rule, we can get two conclusions. The first is that the pattern on the right side of an association rule  might be not frequent in the conditional database of the pattern on the left side. The second is that in order to derive all association rules, we should give a global minimum confidence for all frequent patterns. It is sometimes difficult for us to determine a properly minimum confidence. Furthermore, we can conclude that association rules reflect only one kind of association relationships, that is, the conditional probability between two frequent patterns of both sides of an association rule is larger than or equal to a given minimum confidence. As a result, association rules have less significance in TCM researches. In this paper, we propose to mine strongly associated rules, which have much more probability than association rules to be novel paired or grouped drugs on account of strongly associated relationships between both sides of a rule. First we give the concept of a strongly associated rule, and then we develop the techniques for finding all strongly associated rules from large database.

We put forward four kinds of strongly associated rules.

The first is based on frequent pattern [3]. The second is based on maximal frequent mutually associated pattern [4]. The third is based on mutually and positively correlated pattern [5]. The fourth is based on both associated and correlated pattern [6]. Experimental results on Chinese Ancient Medical Formula Database and Traditional Chinese Medicine Herbal Database illustrate that all techniques developed in the paper are feasible.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we give some related definitions, and then develop an approach for mining all kinds strongly associated rules. In Section 3, we show our experimental results. We conclude our study in section 4.

2. Mining strongly associated rules   This section first introduces some related definitions, and then develops an efficient approach for discovering all kinds of strongly associated rules.

Definition 1 (a strongly associated rule based on frequent pattern) let pattern X  be a frequent pattern and pattern Y also be a frequent pattern in the conditional database of X . If the conditional probability ( / )P Y X is greater than or equal to the given minimum confidence, then the rule  X Y?  is called a strongly associated rule based on frequent pattern X or derived from X .

DOI 10.1109/FSKD.2009.203    DOI 10.1109/FSKD.2009.203     Definition 2 (a strongly associated rule based on maximal frequent mutually associated pattern) let pattern X be a maximal frequent mutually associated pattern and  pattern Y also be a maximal frequent mutually associated pattern in the conditional database of X . If the conditional probability ( / )P Y X is greater than or equal to the given minimum confidence, then the rule  X Y?  is called a strongly associated rule based on maximal frequent mutually associated pattern X or derived from X .

Definition 3 (a strongly associated rule based on mutually and positively correlated pattern) let pattern X be a mutually and positively correlated pattern and pattern Y also be a mutually and positively correlated pattern in the conditional database of X . If the conditional probability ( / )P X Y is greater than or equal to the given minimum confidence, then the rule  X Y?  is called a strongly associated rule based on mutually and positively correlated pattern X or derived from X  .

Definition 4 (a strongly associated rule based on both associated and correlated pattern) let pattern X  be a both associated and correlated pattern, and pattern Y also be a both associated and correlated pattern in the conditional database of X . If the conditional probability ( / )P X Y is greater than or equal to the given minimum confidence, then the rule  X Y?  is called a strongly associated rule based on both associated and correlated pattern X or derived from X .

Definition 5 (strongly associated rules) All kinds of rules of definition 1,2,3,4 are called strongly associated rules.

From above five definitions, we can conclude that if X is a frequent pattern and the support of Y is greater than  or equal to the given minimum confidence in the conditional database of X  , i.e. Y is frequent in conditional database of X , then the rule  X Y?  is called a strongly associated rule based on frequent pattern X .

Similarly, if X is a maximal frequent mutually associated pattern and Y is a maximal frequent mutually associated pattern in conditional database of X with the support greater than or equal to the given minimum confidence, then the rule  X Y?  is called a strongly associated rule based on maximal frequent mutually associated pattern X .

Thus, for an arbitrary maximal frequent mutually associated pattern X and a given minimum confidence, if we find all maximal frequent mutually associated patterns with support greater than or equal to the minimum confidence in the conditional database of  X , we can get all  strongly associated rules derived from X . For this reason, the minimum confidence given can be varied with pattern X . Meanwhile, the algorithm for generating strongly associated rules based on maximal frequent mutually associated patterns has two steps. Firstly, we find all maximal frequent mutually associated patterns in  the global database. Secondly, for an arbitrary maximal frequent mutually associated pattern X and for a given minimum confidence, we deep mine all maximal frequent mutually associated patterns with support greater than or equal to the minimum confidence in the conditional database of X . By the same method, we can find all other kinds of strongly associated rules. Consequently, we integrate all algorithms in [4, 5, 6] and develop a system DBM for discovering all kinds of strongly associated rules from TCM Formula Database. By our system DBM, we provide large number of strongly associated rules for TCM experts to judge whether they are novel paired or grouped drugs. Experimental results of mining strongly associated rules by the system DBM from TCM Formula Database will be report in session 3.

The following is the algorithm we developed for discovering strongly associated rules based on maximal frequent mutually associated patterns efficiently.

Algorithm: Mining strongly associated rules based on maximal frequent mutually associated patterns.

Input: a transaction database TDB , a support threshold ?  , a minimum confidence ?  and a minimum all- confidence ? .

Output: the complete set of strongly associated rules based on maximal frequent mutually associated patterns.

Method: 1. Initialization. Let FMP  be the set of maximal frequent patterns after pruning in its conditional database, let MFMAP  be the set of maximal frequent mutually associated patterns. Let SAR  be the set of strongly associated rules. Initialize:  ;FMP MFMAP? ?? ? ; SAR ?? ; 2. Find frequent items. Scan transaction database TDB , compute frequent item list _f list ; 3. First prune the items which do not satisfy the lemma 1 [4] and then mine maximal frequent patterns in its conditional database recursively.

Call FMP - ( , , _ , )TDB f list FMP? ; 4. Derive maximal frequent mutually associated patterns from maximal frequent patterns using lemma 2 [4] and lemma 3 [4] recursively. Call MFMAP- ( , , , )TDB FMP MFMAP? ; 5. For a maximal frequent mutually associated pattern X , derived all strongly associated rules based on X call SAR- ( , , , )TDB MFMAP SAR? ; 6. Output all strongly associated rules SAR .

Subroutine?     FMP - ( , , _ , )TDB f list FMP? ,  MFMAP- ( , , , )TDB FMP MFMAP? , SAR- ( , , , )TDB MFMAP SAR? ,  Parameters: 1. X :  the frequent pattern if DB is an X - conditional database, or ? if DB  is TDB ; 2. DB : transaction database of condition database; 3. _f list :  frequent item list of DB ; 4. FMP :  maximal frequent patterns after pruning in its conditional database; 5. MFMAP : the set of maximal frequent mutually associated patterns; 6. SAR : the set of all strongly associated rules.

Method? 1. Let Y  be the set of all items which satisfy lemma 1 in _f list , if Y appear in every transaction of DB , insert X Y?  to FMP  if it is not a proper subset of some pattern in MFMAP , else continue to form conditional database until all frequent items which satisfy lemma 1 in certain database appear in every transaction of the conditional database;/lemma 1 and lemma 2 [4].

2. Derive the maximal frequent mutually associated patterns from X Y?  in the X - conditional database by cutting the most frequent item from pattern Y . If the derived pattern is not a proper subset of some pattern in MFMAP  , then insert it into MFMAP ;/lemma 3.

3. Derive all strongly associated rules and insert into to SAR .

4. Form conditional database for every remaining item in _f list , at the same time , compute local frequent item lists for these condition database.

5. If all the remaining items in (global) _f list  are not all included in a certain pattern in MFMAP , for each remaining item i  in _f list , starting from the first one, call  FMP- ( , / , )i iiX DB f list FMP?  , call MFMAP-  ( , / , , )iiX DB FMP MFMAP  and call SAR-  ( , , , )TDB MFMAP SAR?  where / iDB  is the i - conditional database with respect to  DB  and if list? is the corresponding  frequent item list.

3. Experimental Results   Our lab has collaborated with China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine (CATCM) since 1999 and developed a unified web accessible multi-databases query system of TCM bibliographic databases and specific medical databases in recent years. Hence, data sets used for our experiments come from CATCM. One of databases widely used in TCM is Chinese Ancient Medical Formula Database (CAMFD). As a popular medication, traditional Chinese ancient medical formulas play an important part in the health undertakings for Chinese people for several thousand years. This database contains 85988 records derived from more than 700 ancient medical books with about 20000 kinds of drugs involved. Each record has an average length of 8 kinds of medicine. Two crucial attributes of CAMFD are ingredients and efficacy. Ingredients contain the effective components constituting a formula. And efficacy is a textual attribute describing TCM remedy principle. The second database is the Herbal Medicine Formula Database (HMFD), which contains 4646 records derived from modern publications also with about 20000 kinds of medicine involved.

Table 1 shows the number of maximal frequent mutually associated patterns generated on CAMFD when minimum support is fixed and the minimum all- confidence varies. If both the minimum support and the minimum all_confidence are high, there are few maximal frequent mutually associated patterns generated because the database is sparse. When the minimum all-confidence is low, the number of maximal frequent mutually associated patterns is large. Therefore, in our experiment, we select partly formulas which have some characters as our input.

Firstly, we introduce the experimental results of mining strongly associated rules based on maximal frequent mutually associated pattern on HMFD by our system DBM. We select all formulas which contain drug angelica from HMFD. There are 976 formulas which contain angelica in HMFD. Let the minimum support be 5% and the minimum all_confidence be 50%. We get only nine maximal frequent mutually associated patterns because of the high minimum all_confidence. Paired drug myrrh and frankincense has the highest all_confidence 87%. Let the minimum support also be 5% and the minimum all_confidence also be 50%. We deep mine maximal frequent mutually associated patterns in the conditional database of paired drug myrrh and frankincense. We get 41 maximal frequent mutually associated patterns in the conditional database of paired drug myrrh and frankincense. Thus, we get 41 strongly associated rules based on paired drug myrrh and frankincense. Paired drug rhizoma sparganii and rhizoma curcumae has the highest all_confidence 71% in the conditional database of paired drug myrrh and     frankincense. Thus, we get a strongly associated rule: myrrh, Frankincense-> rhizoma Sparganii and rhizoma curcumae. Strongly associated rule: myrrh, Frankincense- > rhizoma Sparganii and rhizoma curcumae has much interest in TCM researches. Myrrh, frankincense, Rhizoma Sparganii and rhizoma curcumae is a useful grouped drug which several formulas contain.

Secondly, we introduce the experimental results of mining strongly associated rules based on maximal frequent mutually associated patterns on CAMFD. We select all formulas which have efficacy clean away heat and material from CAMFD. There are 162 formulas which have efficacy clean away heat and material in CAMFD. Let the minimum support be 5% and the minimum all_confidence be 10%. We get 38 maximal frequent mutually associated patterns.  Paired drug rhubarb and root of common peony has both a high support and a high all_confidence. Let the minimum support also be 5% and the minimum all_confidence also be 10%. We deep mine all maximal frequent mutually associated patterns in the conditional database of rhubarb and root of common peony. We get 8 maximal frequent mutually associated patterns in the conditional database of rhubarb and root of common peony. Thus, we get 8 strongly associated rules based on paired drug rhubarb, root of common peony. Paired drug radix aconite and kusnezoff monkshood root has the highest all_confidence 77% in the conditional database of rhubarb and root of common peony, so we get a strongly associated rule: rhubarb and root of common peony->radix aconite, kusnezoff monkshood root. Paired drug rhubarb, root of common peony, and paired drug radix aconite, kusnezoff monkshood root consists of an interesting grouped drug which several formulas contain.

We can conclude from our experimental results that our system DBM not only provides large number of strongly associated rules for TCM experts to judge whether they are novel paired or grouped drugs, but also validates that many strongly associated rules are useful paired or grouped drugs discovered.

Table 1.  maximal frequent mutually associated patterns on CAMFD              4. Conclusions   Association rules reflect only one kind of association relationships and thus have less interest in discovering  novel paired or grouped drugs. In this paper, we propose to mine strongly associated rules, which are extraordinary useful in finding novel paired or grouped drugs because of strongly associated relationships between both sides of a rule. We develop a system DBM on TCM Formula Database for discovering all kinds of strongly associated rules. By our system DBM, we provide large number of strongly associated rules for TCM experts to judge whether they are novel paired or grouped drugs.

Experimental results show that strongly associated rule mining is more effective and efficient than association rule mining.
