Traffic Accident Treatment Expert System Based on Integrated Reasoning

Abstract? In order to handle the traffic accidents timely and accurately and draw conclusions from them to formulate measures of preventing similar accidents, an expert system with integrated reasoning method is put forward and applied to traffic accident treatment according to the characteristics of traffic accidents. This method adopts an integrated reasoning approach in which the CBR (case-based reasoning) is the priority with the RBR (rule-based reasoning) as an auxiliary way. The system applies data mining and knowledge obtaining technology to establish knowledge base and traffic accident case base, and uses association rule and decision trees algorithm to calculate case similarity. The experiment shows that the reasoning method can increase the system?s flexibility and accuracy, and provide a scientific basis for analysis and treatment of traffic accidents.

I. INTRODUCTION With the rapid development of auto industry and  transportation, traffic accidents have presently become one of the public hazards throughout the world. By comparison, China is now one of the countries that have the highest traffic accident rate. Since 1990s, the number of traffic accidents in China has been increasing with more death each year [1]. Facing with an enormous number of traffic accidents, how to accelerate the treatment of the accidents and make the analysis and processing of them more scientific and accurate has become a significant research direction of traffic management. However, it?s difficult to make a judgment because of the complicated causes and inadequate personal experiences. Therefore, it?s necessary to combine the experiences from traffic accident experts to build a traffic accident treatment expert system, which assists the traffic police in handling the accidents and analyzing the causes through the uncertainty reasoning approach of artificial intelligence. It researched the integrated reasoning model which is based on CBR and RBR and put forward a new way for traffic accident treatment [2].



II.  SYSTEM ANALYSIS  A. Traffic Accident Treatment Method The complicated process of traffic accident  treatment involves laws and regulations concerned, national standards concerned, industry standards concerned, treatment measures, accident analysis and calculation models and typical cases, etc. [3]. It mainly includes:  ? Reconnaissance of the scene: inquiry upon both parties of the accident, inspection of the material evidence, examination of the corpse?s surface and technical identification of the vehicles, etc..

? Investigation into the accident causes: corresponding calculation based on the scene reconnaissance, analysis of the accident causes and reports for the causes.

? Opinion on responsibility: opinion on responsibility proposed according to the accident causes and legal documents concerned.

? Opinion on punishment: opinion on punishment raised according to laws, rules and regulations concerned about traffic accident treatment, and its explanation, national standards concerned and industry standards concerned.

B. Conceptual Framework  of Accident Treatment Traffic accident treatment refers to the following:  the treatment agent (traffic police and traffic safety experts) examines the accident object (vehicles of two parties in the accident) by certain judgment means according to all the reconnaissance information from the scene of accident left by the accident object, finds corresponding causes, judges whether the object should take on the responsibility, thus makes an objective summary of the accident responsibility. Generally, factors that affect the traffic accident treatment include the treatment agent, the accident object, the scene of accident, accident responsibility, accident causes, etc..

Figure 1. Conceptual framework of accident treatment  C. Knowledge Preprocessing A large number of vague, incomplete and redundant  information are involved in the progressing of traffic accident. The data must be cleared up and filtered before they are processed in order to ensure the consistency and determinacy of the data, so that they can be made into suitable patterns for data mining.

Then classification algorithm is used to classify traffic accident information and summarize accident treatment rules [4]. Algorithms for data mining in the system are association rule algorithm and decision trees algorithm.

The former gets the relativity among accidents by analyzing the frequently-used parameters such as dependability, reliability and popularity; etc.; while the latter analyzes and handles traffic accidents by matching the unknown-type accident with the well- known ones.

D. Knowledge Establishment Knowledge is shown as vast cases in the case base  and accident treatment rules in the rule base. The knowledge of the system mainly includes the knowledge base and the case base.

The establishment of the case base: the case base is made up of a large quantity of typical cases summarized by traffic polices and traffic safety experts over the years. It is a process ranging from inputting cases into the base to establishing the charactered index of relevant cases, thus forming a case base that the reasoning system demands. The case base is the foundation of CBR.

The establishment of the rule base: the case of traffic accident is a collection of a large volume of different data. The process of data mining is using various kinds of tools and algorithms to find out the relations between the models and data in order to obtain the potential knowledge. On the knowledge layer, the system builds up the data base and summarizes the relevant rules of traffic accident treatment by using the decision trees algorithm and association rules  algorithm. Then after being assessed and classified, the rules are finally preserved in the rule base for RBR use.



III. IMPLEMENTATION OF REASONING  A. Integrated Reasoning Model The integrated reasoning model in the expert system  is shown in Fig. 2.

Figure 2. Integrated reasoning model There are three layers: knowledge establishment  layer and knowledge reasoning layer and user layer. On the knowledge establishment layer the case base is founded by a large quantity of typical historical cases summarized by traffic accident treatment police and traffic safety experts; the rule base is established by mining potential rules for accident treatment from abundant irregular traffic accident case data. On the knowledge reasoning layer the accident treatment result is acquired by integrated case reasoning when a new case is input. On the user interface layer, the users accomplish describing the problems of the traffic accident.

B. Reasoning Principle  The CBR and RBR can be combined in many ways.

In order to meet the needs of the traffic accident treatment, the system uses the integration approach which adopts the CBR as the priority and RBR as the supplement.

In the integrated reasoning system, Case X of CBR is described as a triad ?X =<x1, x2, x3>?. x1 is a finite set representing the expository information of traffic accidents such as the condition of the vehicles and drivers, the environment accident scene and the description of the accident. x2 is a nonempty finite set representing all kinds of characteristic information of the traffic accidents. It mainly selects the deviant values from the tests and assays as the characteristic information of each case. x3 is a finite set representing the illuminating information of the cases such as professional knowledge, accident causes and precautionary measures.

The CBR process is mainly composed of case retrieve, case reuse, case revision and case maintenance, among which case retrieve is the key step to CBR. The case similarity retrieve is the core process     of case retrieve; it is different from the key word retrieve of common data base systems. The equation for calculating the case similarity is:  ? =  ][ ])[][(  iweight iweightisimilarity  similarity   ? =  ][1  ][ iweight  isimilarity (1)  The i represents the ith matching feature; the similarity[i] represents the similarity of the ith matching feature between cases, when the attribute value are equal, the value of similarity[i] is 1?weight[i], otherwise its value is 0; the weight[i] represents the weight coefficient of the ith matching feature. The attribute weight is established by the traffic safety experts. The weights of the cases are equal in the default situation of the system. The higher calculation similarity is, the higher the matching level is [5].

C. Implementation of Reasoning  Knowledge reasoning in traffic accident treatment is such a process: case reasoning is a predominant way, supplemented by rule reasoning, by which a satisfactory treatment proposal is obtained. Finally, basic information of the new case is preserved in the typical case base. The implementation of reasoning includes the following steps:  ? Receiving a new case, the system firstly traverses the whole rule base, then obtains several initial results of the processing with the help of the RBR and calculates the rate of each possible result.

? A new CBR target case is built up by reasoning result of RBR and the expected treatment case.

? The RBR result is utilized by the CBR to instruct the searching and matching to seek similar cases.

? Cases are corrected and adjusted to get closer to the expected case.

? The solved cases are preserved in the case base.

D. Algorithm Description The reasoning process of the system refers to the  CBR making the responsibility judgment to the target case with the auxiliary result of the RBR. The result of the RBR instructs the CBR to retrieve the most similar case to the target one. Both of them cooperate with each other and achieve the mutual completion of the reasoning and analyzing of the traffic accident. The reasoning algorithm is described as the following:  ? Supposing there are cases c1, c2,?,cn existing in the case base C.

? Initialize x  // initializing the target case x.

? x' RBR x  // the RBR creating initial results  and regenerating a target case x'.

? C   x'   // inputting the target case x' into the case base.

? Retrieving a target set.

? For each ci ?target set do     // ci stands for  every case in C.

? Similarity (x?, ci )  // calculating the similarity  between x' and ci according to the similarity function.

? Figuring out the subsequent case of ci :ci+1.

? While (all cases in target set being found).

? t = max (similarity (x', cj ) ) ? Revising and amending the case.

? Obtaining the reasoning result and preserving  the new case.



IV. EXPERIMENT In order to validate the reliability of the reasoning  algorithm, the main function of the system has been implemented based on the Visual Studio2005 platform.

Among all the traffic accidents, the material damage caused by car-to-car collision is the worst and leads to the most disputes. To thoroughly and systematically analyze the accidents between vehicles has become an urgent issue. Therefore, this experiment adopts the collision between two cars as the experimental case. To simplify the experiment, the consideration is only taken from the angular point of a car which collides with the side of the other car. Since each angular point of a car possibly hits the 4 sides of the other car producing four conceivable results, four angular points of a car can produce the 16 conceivable results when hitting the four sides of the other car respectively marked as A1-A16 (16 types of the vehicle collision accident). This system adopts the recent three-year records of the vehicle collision accident cases of a traffic administration office of a city in China as the experiment data to validate the reasoning model designed by the system. The experiment process randomly picks up 6 items from over 6,000 accident cases as the target cases and eventually finds out the similarities of the results shown in Table 1. The ?expert? represents the treatment results from the experts and the ?system? represents the treatment results from the system. The ?A1? to the ?A16? refer to the corresponding type of car collision accidents.
