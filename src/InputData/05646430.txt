Research on the Application of Multidimensional Association Rule in

Abstract -Recently, there have been more and more  building construction accidents. Meanwhile, the reasons  leading to these accidents are becoming increasingly  complicated. In this paper, the multi-dimensional association  rule is applied to help analyze the reasons of these  construction accidents. This paper also shows how to  identify the strong association rules among person,  instrument, environment and accident types. Furthermore,  through the application of the strong association rules in 387  cases, the frequent reasons leading to the accidents are  identified and combined for the purpose of finding the  regulations of the accidents. Finally, these rules are taken as  the basis for the managers to make precaution decisions.

I. INTRODUCTION  With the rapid development of economic, the  construction industry, as one of the most significant  productive sectors of national economy, plays an  important role in infrastructures. However, attended with  characters, such as only-one-time, complexity, and work  in the open or lofty place, labor intensity and so on, the  construction accidents have taken place frequently.

Meanwhile, the number of casualties is still on the rise.

According to incompletely statistics in reference [ 1], 387  safety accidents of level III during the construction period  accrued from 1997 to 2006 among the whole nation.

There must be so many reasons that made the accidents  caused. Then how to find the valuable potential ones  becomes a urgent event. Based on the valid extracted  information quoted from reference [2], the managers at  the construction sites can organize the workers to do their  jobs high efficiently.

The leading causes of death among construction  workers around the whole nation could be divided into  five mainly types, such as high falls, caving-in or collapse,    mechanical injury, poisoning and electrocution. The main  reasons could be summed up into four groups, namely  person factors, material or instrument factors,  environmental factors and management factors, etc.

Considering the difficulty to distinguish person factor  from the management, this paper finally uses a famous  method called Multidimensional Association Rules to  analyze the potential relationship among the construction  accidents, and then figure out some strong association  978-1-4244-6484-5/10/$26.00 2010 IEEE   rules between "person-instrument-environment" and the  types of accidents. The result of this research not only  provides decision support for the administrative officials  at the construction sits, but also could efficiently help  reduce casualties and losses resulting from several  uncertainties for the whole country.



II. THE ASSOCIATION RULES ON CONSTRUCTION  ACCIDENST  The causes of construction accidents cover human,  instruments environment and others, but generally a  particular factor could hardly cause a certain accident.

Construction accidents happened frequently that resulting  in interactions among several risk factors. Data mining is  a process of identifying novel and potentially useful  patterns in data. Further, as one of the most important  analysis tools of Data mining, Association Rules could  breakdown the causes of construction accidents and test  all the combinations of all causes to get useful frequent  predicate sets in order to generate strong association rules.

A. Association Rules  Reference [3] shows that Agrawal put forward how to  find the association rules from the frequent itemsets of  customers' transactions in 1993. Association Rule is such  a model that could deduce certain patter like "A ? BOO.

For an example, if define Affair A as instability of  formwork support system and Affair B as caving-in, the  patter of A ? B could be considered as this situation that  when the formwork support system is out of instability  during the construction, the building around the sites  could cave in or collapse.

Supposed D= {T"Tz, .. . ,Tn}, Tj{j=I,2, ... ,n) which is    short of Transaction T as customers' transactions database,  the elements of Transaction T, ik(k=I,2, ... ,p), just are  called as Itemsets. Set the all collections of D's itemsets  as I= {i"h, . . . ,im}, apparently TC I.

A as well as B are both itemsets in D, and AnB= <I> ,  the association rule, A ? B, would be constrained by two  parameters. One parameter is Support, and the other is  Confidence. Support can be defined as one kind of ratio of  that the Transaction D contains simultaneously Itemsets A  and Itemsets B, and then support shows frequency of the  association rules. Confidence can be defined as other kind  of ratio that Itemsets A contains simultaneously Itemsets  A and Itemsets B, and then confidence shows strength of  the association rules.

3) Establish a Multidimensional Data Model.

According to the characteristics and causes of the  construction accidents, set up data attributes as "Person  Instrument-Environment". These attributes are showed in  Table l .

I f  Support of Itemset A meets min-Support shorts for  minimum Support threshold value, namely we could call  A as Frequent Itemsets A of Transaction D. At the same  time, supposed that the Association Rule A ? B exists,  Strong Association Rule is such a rule that not only the Table I Data attribute on construction  accident accidents of Level  support of A ? B meets default min-support, but also the  confidence of A ? B also meets.

C Sample Data  1) Collect relevant construction historical accidents.

2) To ensure the data for analysis effective, clean up  the inconsistent or error construction accident data record  in order to make the data accurately. Through Data  Cleaning, mainly solve the special accident data that  would impact the coincidence of data files.

According to the historical construction accident data  of level III quoted in reference [5], use the Sample  Selection Method to figure out these 20 samples shown in  Table 2.

The  Single-dimensional Rules can handle with relations  among the single attributes data. Multi-dimensional Rules  is dealing with some of the relationship between the  various attributes data. Therefore multidimensional  association rules mining that this paper discussed analyzes  the accidents from the different aspects, such as person,  instruments or environment and so on, in order to figure  out why the accidents happened.

According to the types of the accidents, Association  Rules contains Boolean types and numerical types.

Boolean type of Association Rules could tell some  relationships from the discrete and variable accidents. For  the numerical data, this mining method can proceed with  dynamic segmentation, or directly have the original data  processed.

The process of Multidimensional Association Rules  mining can be summarized as two phases:  I) To find all frequent predicate sets from transaction  database.

2) According to the frequent predicate sets, the strong  association rules, which meet the minimum support and    minimum confidence, would be set up in order to provide  basis for the decision-making.



III. APPLICATON AND EV ALVA TION  A. Dala Cleaning  According to the purpose of finding the rules that  reasons of construction accidents account for the type of  them, supposed that the sample data in Table 2 are  completive records. And to put forward relevant rules  easily, the specific accident attributes like Accident, Time  and City will be removed. Finally, the attributes of these  columns like Type, Person, Instrument and Environment  left.

B Multidimensional Attribute  I) Data Cleaning. Through the analysis, concept  hierarchy will be defined as that the original value of the  property would be replaced by interval values or concepts  of higher layer, the similar concept is shown in reference  [6]. The classification of different dimensions on  construction accident would be shown in Table 3.

2) Data Expression. Then construction accident  sample data can be expressed as:  AOOI {ThPhI3};A002{TI ,Phll};A003 {T3,P3,h};A004  {T 2,P 6,4} ;A005 {T s,P I ,14} ;A006 {T 2,P 4,1 I} ;A007 {T 2,P 1,1 I}  ;A008{Ts,PhI3};A009 {T2,Ps.h};AOIO {T 2,P6.h};AOll {T2  .p 4.14} ;AO 12 {T 3.P 4.14} ;AO 13 {T 2.Plh} ;AO 14 {T 2,P 4.h} ;AO  15 {ThPI.II };AOI6 {T 2.Phll} ;AOI7 {T 4.P4.11 };AOI8 {Ts,P3  h} ;AOI9{Ts,Phll} ;A020 {T 2.P6.h}.

3) Data Cube. According to the concept hierarchy,  three dimensions, Type. Person and Environment, have  been selected for the dimensions of Data Cube showed in  reference [7].

4) Frequent predicate sets. Based on algorithm quoted  in Reference [4], this paper sets 2 as minimum support  counts. Then this paper would look for frequent predicate  sets.

According to the sample data on construction  accidents, the association rules are produced by frequent  predicate sets. The sets are SI= {Th Ph Id, S2= {T2, Ph II}.

S3= {T2, P4 Id and S4= {T2, P6 12}.

Table 3 the Classification of Different Dimensions on Construction  Accidents    The reasons  of  construction  accidents  Dimensional  Types of the  construction  accidents  <n  Personal  reasons  (P)  Instrument  reasons  (I)  Environmental  reasons  (E)  Description  High fall (T I)  Caving-in or collapse  (T2)  Poisoning (T3)  Mechanical injury (T 4)  Electrocution (T 5)  Others (T6)  Operation contrary to  instruction (P I)  Overlapping jobs (P2)  No professional skill (P3)  Bad commanding (P 4)  No security checks (P 5)  Others (P6)  Instrument failure (II)  No security equipment  (12)  Installation without the  regulations (13)  Others (14)  Bad weathers (EI)  Operation at high  position (E2)    Geological hazard (E3)  Poisonous gas (E4)  Complex construction  sites (E5)  Others (E6)  SI has some nonempty subsets like {Th Pd. {Th  Id. {Ph Id. {Td. {PI}. {Id  S2 has some nonempty subsets like {T2 Pd. {T2 Id.

{Ph Id. {T2}. {PI}. {Id.

S3 has some nonempty subsets like {T2 P4}. {T2 Id.

{P4, Id. {T2}. {P4}. {II}.

S4 has some nonempty subsets like {T2 P6}. {T2 h}.

{P6 h}. {T2}. {P6}. {h}.

As previous research. this paper tries to figure out the  association rules from the factors of person and  instrument so that the type of accidents would be found.

Therefore, the produced rules could be expressed as  following.

CDPI!\II ?T), Support(PI !\ II ?TI)=IO%,  Confidence(P I !\ I I ? T I )=40%.

PI !\II ? T 2, Support(PI!\ II ? T 2)=15%,  Confidence(P I !\ I I ? T 2)=60%.

P4!\11 ?T2' Support(P4!\11 ?T2)=10%,  Confidence(P 4!\ I I ? T 2)= 1 00%.

@P6!\I2 ? T 2, SuPPort(P6!\ 12 ? T 2)=10%,  Confidence(P 6!\ 12 ? T 2)= 1 00%.

Supposed the value of min-support as 70%, the strong  association rule figured from frequent predicate sets  would be {P4!\II ? T2} and {P6!\12 ? T2}'  6) The evaluation of association rules. According to  the construction accidents of level III, the effective and  value strong association rules could be expressed as:  {Bad command, instrument failure ? collapse accident,  (Support= 10%, Confidence= 1 OO%)}.

{Other person-factors, no protection ? collapse  accident, (Support= 10%, Confidence= 1 OO%)}.

In construction process, a bad command plus  instrument failure often make collapse accident happened.

Under other person-factors and no protection devices  situation, collapse accident would take place. According  to the result, in construction sites, the management  officials should pay more attention on commanding,    equipment failures and safety measures.

N. TEST RESULTS  Based on 387 safety accidents of level III during the  construction accidents accrued from 1997 to 2006 among  the whole nation, this paper selects the four dimensions,  Type, Person, Instrument and Environment, to find the  association rules. Let min-sup be 2.5% and min-conf be  70%, valuable results are listed below.

Frequent predicate sets are those followings:  CD high fall, instruction, no protection instrument,  operation at high position (support account is 12).

collapse, operation contrary to instruction, no  protection instrument, complicate sites (support account is  15).

collapse, no security check, no protection  instrument, complicate sites (support account is 14).

@ poisoning, bad commanding, no protection  instrument, poisonous gas (support account is 18).

Strong association rules are those followings:  CD operation contrary to instruction, no protection  instrument, operation at high position ? high fall (the  value of confidence is 80%).

operation contrary to instruction, no protection  instrument, complicate sites ? collapse (the value of  confidence is 88%).

no security check, no protection instrument,  complicate sites ? collapse (the value of confidence is  93%).

@ bad commanding, no protection instrument,  poisonous gas ? poisoning (the value of confidence is  100%).

From the valuable strong association rules, the  workers who operate in high during the course of  construction without protection equipment would have an  accident of high-falls with 80% possibility. Sometimes  the constructors conduct some construction without safety  equipments at complex sites would be in the accident  situation of collapse contrary to instruction with 88%  possibility. After construction, perhaps 93 percent of the  workers who then do some operation in the complex  construction sites without certain security checks and    protection equipments would be injured under the  situation of caving-in. Otherwise, along with the  poisonous gas leaking out, the construction operators get  poisoned, however, the management officials commit  some bad commanding at the construction sites, then the  operators still do their work without security equipments  so that the accident of poisoning happen almost.

If other reasons exist, using frequent predicate sets  summarized by construction accidents can find other  potential rules with more than 80% of confidence in the  data, which also have proved the summarized rules are  reliable.



V. CONCLUSION  Due to the construction of accidents, finally accidents  records on construction increase sharply. With the aspect  of Data Mining, this paper tries to provide a kind of  decision support tool for construction units. Having  established a model of multidimensional association rules,  this research could figure out why so many accidents took  place by using the relevant records on construction  through the relationship between the types of construction  accidents and the dimensions of "person-instrument  environment". In practical applications, the two  significant parameters, minimum support and minimum  confidence, influence the accuracy of association rules  during the process of data mining. Therefore with the help  of related experts or experienced personnel jointly, the  parameters can be defined properly. That mining some  relationships among construction accidents, can in a  certain extent have some assistants for helping change the  present situation of construction accidents occurred  frequently, and plays a role of the warning, which help  make correct and effective decision.
