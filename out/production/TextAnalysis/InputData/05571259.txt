This paper proposes a  method of constructing a high-quality feature extension mode  library. In our method, firstly, we obtained the feature  extension modes from the training set, and then introduced  three measures, i.e., confidence, category homoplasy and  relevancy strength of the obtained feature extension mode, to  improve their quality. Finally, we used the high-quality feature  extension modes to construct a high-quality feature extension  mode library. Experimental results show that (1) Introducing  the three measures can improve the quality of feature  extension mode in some degree respectively; (2)A high-quality  feature extension mode library is helpful to improving the  effect of Chinese short-text classification.

I. INTRODUCTION  With the rapid development of information technology,  the form of information transmission has been being  endlessly enriched. As the major representative form of  information such as SMS, online charting and Netizen  comments, short-text, which generally has no more than  160b, becomes the important channel for the dissemination  of public information. But taking the short-text as the carrier,    propagation of all kinds of pornography, violence, rumor,  reactionary remarks, fraud and illegal advertising in network  will inevitably become the hidden trouble of social stability  with the fast explosive growth of short-text. So we must  effectively monitor, intercept and filter the harmful  information related to that. Short-text classification  technology [1-4], which delivers the short-texts to some pre-  defined classes based on the content analysis, is a kind of  effective way accounting for above mentioned problems.

Owing to the fact that the short-text has inherent defects  such as short length, weak signal and high ambiguity, the  short-text categorization is a very challenging task. So far,  one feasible way to handle the difficulties in the short-text  classification is making use of some extra information [3-4]  to assist classification. The method of introducing extra  information is doing feature extension for short-text by  excavating the hidden information itself. The goal of  introducing extra information is to enhance the quantity of  short-texts content or make up its inherent defects.

As important extra information, the co-occurrence  relationships among terms are helpful for short-text  classification [4]. The process such as in [4], which  introduced simple co-occurrence relationships and didnt  consider their quality, may bring noise into texts, and lead  that it is difficult to get a satisfied classification result. While  we call the collection of co-occurrence relationships among  terms for short-text classification as feature extension mode  library, it is obvious that, the core issue of improving  classification performance is to build a high quality feature  extension mode library. This needs to solve the following  problems. (1) What measures can determine whether a  feature extension mode, i.e., a co-occurrence relationship, is  high quality or not? (2) How to utilize the measures to  extract high quality feature extension modes.

According to the two problems above, the main work of  this paper are as follows: (1) a new measure  called category  homoplasy, which could effectively describe category  distribution or category tendency of a feature extension mode  is proposed to consider the quality of a feature extension  mode; (2) another new measure called relevancy strength,  which could effectively describe the relevance between  terms which represent a feature extension mode, is proposed    to measure the validity of the information of a feature  extension mode; (3) a new method of constructing a high-  quality feature extension mode library is presented by  introducing confidence, category homoplasy and relevancy  strength which can improve the quality of feature extension  modes effectively into the constructing process of it. The  method, which starts with mining the co-occurrence  relationships hidden in the training set which are the source  of the feature extension mode library, ensures the validity of  extra information for short-text classification.



II. ANALYSIS FOR MAIN PROBLEM AND THE SOLUTIN OF  MAIN PROBLEMS  A. Analysis for Main Problems  As paper [4], we consider the words which are co-   978-0-7695-4080-1/10 $26.00  2010 IEEE  DOI 10.1109/ICIE.2010.117   occurrence more than a certain percentage of the training set  are interrelated. And obtain the co-occurrence relationships  hidden in training set by association rules mining [5-6].

In order to ensure that the feature extension modes can be  covered all categories in training set, there are two ways that  we can adopt. One way is that we obtain the feature  extension modes from each category respectively and then  combine them for the final feature extension mode library.

The other way is that we obtain the feature extension modes  overall and the feature extension mode library. For the first  way, there exits a problem: some feature extension modes  may appear in multiple categories, which leads that feature  extension modes do not have strong category distinguish  ability and have low quality. For example, the mode ??=>  ?? (Netizen=>comment) appears not only in Reading  category but also in News category. When we read ?? in  the texts of Reading category , the word ??will be  extended into the texts according to our extension strategy. If  so, it will add category fuzzy to the classified texts after  doing feature extension. As to the second way, there exits  such a problem that terms, which represented a feature  extension mode, do not appear in an identity category, and  this also leads its low quality. Take the mode???=>??

(Afghanistan=>people) for example, The word ???

have strong distinguish ability for News category, while the  term ?? tends to Finance. After we extend the texts  including the word??? in News, the word ?? will  brings noise for the classified texts and affect its  classification result. In this paper, we get the feature  extension modes by the second way. And in order to avoid  the problems above, we will give our solution in next part.

In addition, the feature extension modes obtained only  signify that the terms represented a mode are in an identity  text and dont consider the distance between them, however,  in the texts with both syntax and semantics, the terms which  appear closely together always have stronger semantic  relevancy than the terms at distance, and the terms with  strong relevancy can carry much useful information for text  classification. So if we choose the feature extension modes  with strong semantics relevance or short path for the short-  texts, we will get a perfect feature extension result for its  classification. But how do we obtain the effective  information?  The next part includes our solution.

B. The Solution of Main Problems  z The Establishment of Category Homoplasy  Studying the theory of association rule mining, we know  that the more frequently a term appears in the affairs, the  more possible the item-sets including it are frequent. But for  text classification, the terms with high frequency will always  appear in multiple categories and be evenly distributed. That  is to say their category tendency ability is small, or their  contributions to classification are small. So we usually do  some pre-processing to remove the high-frequency but  meaningless terms. Now, if we extend the terms with small  category distinguish ability into the texts, they will bring  noise into the text, and affect the classification result.

In addition, if the category tendency of terms represented  a feature extension mode are inconsistent, it will also bring  noise into the texts. So we need the feature extension modes,  which not only appear in an identity category but also have a  strong distinguish ability for the identity category. According  to the request above, we definite the concrete forms next.

( ) ( )/ ( )Dis A count A count Ai i=                               (1)  Here counti(A) in (1) represents the number of occurrence  of term A in category i, while count(A) represents the total  number of occurrence of A in the training set. Category    Distribution Disi(A) corresponds to the proportion of  occurrence frequency in some category, such as category i.

( ) sec( ( ))/max( ( ))Trend A Dis A Dis Ai j i=                          (2)  Here max() represents the largest category distribution of  term A while sec() is its second largest category distribution,  and i?j. And Trendi(A) denotes category tendency of term A  to category i. From the formula (2), if a term is uniform  distributed, it will have a weak category tendency; else it  has a strong category tendency.

Definition3. (Category Homoplasy) For a feature  extension mode A=>B, calculate the Trendi(A) and Trendj(B).

If there exits i=j and that Trendi(A) and Trendj(B) are both  larger than zero, then we say that the feature extension mode  A=>B have Category Homoplasy.

The intuition of this definition is as follows: Category  Homoplasy is determined by the category tendency of the  terms represented a feature extension mode. If there exits i?j,  the feature extension mode has no Category Homoplasy. If  there exits i=j, but that one or all of the terms has zero  category tendency, the feature extension mode also has no  Category Homoplasy.

The measure of Category Homoplasy ensures that the  terms represented a feature extension mode are inclined to an  identity category, besides, all of them have strong category  tendency. So we can say that the feature extension modes  which satisfy a given threshold of Category Homoplasy have  effective information. However, the terms represented a  feature extension mode have different category distribution,  though they are inclined to an identity category. That may  lead to the thresholds of Category Homoplasy different.

z The Establishment of Relevancy Strength  Based on association rule mining method, they follow the  assumption that the higher co-occurrence frequency the  terms have, the stronger relevancy strength they have. But  there has a problem like that the co-occurring relationship  that appear closely together is considered in the same way as  that co-occurring relationship at distance. For example, the  mode  ? ? => ??  (data=>mining) having the same  frequency of occurrence as ??=>?? (grieve=>country)  would be considered to have the same relevancy strength.

In fact, the former have stronger relevancy strength than the  latter, though their frequencies of co-occurrence are same.

In fact, the co-occurrence frequency and relevancy  strength are two different types of information. Some high  frequent co-occurrences may have weak relevancy strength.

Now how can we determine and measure the relevancy  strength for a co-occurrence relationship? Here, we can call  co-occurrences relationship link [7], and give our answer by  means of link distribution.

( , ) { | ( ), ( ), }dL ab R i pos a j pos b x i j xij d dx = = = ? < ? <                   (3)  Here posd(a) in (3) represents the position of them a  in  documentd . And ( , )dL a bx  is a set of unordered term pairs  consist of two terms a andb which occur in a given window  x  in documentd .

( ) | ( , ) |,  dFre x L a ba b d x= ?                             (4)  Here | . |  in (4) represents the number of elements in the  set, and Frea,b(x) denotes the distribution function of link ab.

It is the total number of the unordered term pair consists of  two terms a and b which co-occurs in a given window x. It is  also called the frequency of link ab when the window size is  x, or it is called link distribution intuitively.

( ) ( ) / ( ), , ,CDF x Fre x Frea b a b a b= ?                       (5)  The Cumulative link distribution function CDFa,b(x)  represents the proportion of term pairs of a and b that have  distance less than or equal tox .

Link distribution Fre(x) is such a function that is  changing with the size of given window. We will find that  cumulative link distribution function of Fre(x) has a good  corresponding relation with relevancy strength. It should be  considered that the higher the proportion of term pairs  having small distance, the stronger relevancy strength  between terms is. The way of introducing CDF(x) avoids  bringing the mode with weak relevancy strength into the  feature extension mode library. According to the training  data, the distributions of CDF(x) and Fre(x) of the two feature  extension modes, which are randomly selected, ??=>??

(Bayerische-Motoren-Werke(BMW)=>price)and??=>?

?(BMW=>Red-Flag) are illustrated as Table.?.

It can be seen that CDF(x) indicates the real relevancy  strength of links, i.e., the CDF(x) values of ??=>??are  more than that of ??=>?? (0.8>0.7727 while x=10,  0.9333 >0.8636 while x =20, 1>0.9545 while x =30); and in    fact the strength of the former is higher than that of the latter.

What Fre(x)of ??=>?? and ??=>?? indicates that  TABLE I.  THE DISTRIBUTION OF CDF(X) AND  FRE(X)OF ??=>??AND??=>??WHEN THRESHOLD  IS  10,20,30,?

win size  distribution  ??=>?? ??=>??

As for the  parameter, window size x is not sensitive; and it can be from  10 to 30 according to our training set. In this paper, x  is 20.



III. OUR CONSTRUCTION APPROACH OF HIGH-QUALITY  FEATURE EXTENSION MODE LIBRARY  The process of constructing a high-quality feature  extension mode library is described as follows:  Step 1 Doing Pre-processing for Data.

First, filter the texts of the training set according to the  list of Chinese stop words. Then consider every filtered text  as an affair and every concept word as a term.

Step 2 Doing Association Rules Mining.

Give a minimum support and a minimum confidence  threshold, and then excavate the association rules of terms  hidden in training set through Fp-Growth algorithm.

Step 3 Checking up the feature words.

Check up the association rules according our feature set  having selected only leaving the association rules whose  former part is not in the feature-set and the latter is.

Step 4 Using Category Homoplasy Constraint.

Scan the training set again to get category tendency of  the terms represented every feature association rule from step  3, and then give the minimum homoplasy thresholds to get  the feature association rules whose terms are not only have  an identity category but also have strong category tendency.

Step 5 Using Relevancy Strength Constraint.

Scan the training set again to get the cumulative link  distribution of every feature association rule from step 4 and  give a minimum relevancy strength threshold to construct a    high-quality feature extension mode library.



IV. EXPERIMENTS  A. Experiments dataset  The dataset is composed of six categories including  finance, reading, news, military, technology, and automobile.

Each category is composed of 18000 Chinese short-texts. We  averagely divided texts of each category into four parts  randomly, one part as testing data, the rest as training data.

B. Experimental Design  In our experiments, the feature extension strategy is  raising the weight of feature terms that represent the latter  part of association rule according to its former terms. We  choose SVM as our text classifier.

For the sake of checking the influences of feature  extension mode library with different quality degree on the  short-text classification, we construct five feature extension  mode libraries with different measures as TABALE ?.

Experimental results  We use the following measures in the evaluation of  classification: Precision (P), Recall (R) and F1-measure (F1).

The experimental results are shown in TABLE ?.

D. Experimental Analysis  Comparing the results of non extended and extended  with I1, we know that the co-occurrence relationships  can be taken as useful extra information to help  short-text classification.

The results of extended with I1, extended with I2,  extended with I3 and extended with I4 show that  confidence, category homoplasy and relevancy  strength can improve the quality of feature extension  mode respectively. Especially category homoplasy,  it can make short-text classification result to the best.

Table. ? indicates that the feature extension mode  libraries with different quality play different roles for  short-text classification. With the improvement of  the quality of feature extension mode library, the  role of extension for short-text concept is enhancing,  or the classification result is improving on the whole.

We can also see that the degree of improvement is  small; even there is decline, such as finance and  automobile. By analyst, there are some reasons as  follows(1)The number of effective feature extension  modes in the feature extension mode library is too  few, leading that the information coverage in it is  limited and the extension chance for term is small;  (2)The feature extension modes obtained are not  accurate enough and could bring some noise into  texts by extension; (3)The inherent defects of short-  text also have an influence on its classification result;  (4)The feature extension strategy may not be very  suitable for Chinese short-text classification.



V. CONCLUSION  In this paper, we study how to construct a high-quality  feature extension mode library for short-text classification.

And put forward that we could use confidence, category  homoplasy and relevancy strength to improve the quality of  feature extension modes. We also verified that confidence,  category homoplasy and relevancy strength are effective through our  experiments. In the same time we have drawn the following  conclusions: (1) Introducing extra information such as co-occurrence  relationships for short-text can improve their classification  performance; (2) In order to ensure the plentiful-ness and  effectiveness of information in the feature extension mode library,  we should choose the suitable thresholds; (3) The available  information is too small to meet the demand of short-text feature  extension. So we should find out a perfect method which can  increase information coverage in the feature extension mode library  for short-text classification; (4) how to use the high-quality feature  extension library for short-text extension effectively, i.e., choosing a  perfect feature extension strategy is also our further work.
