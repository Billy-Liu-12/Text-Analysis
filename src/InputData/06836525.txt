Airborne Imaging for Cultural Heritage Tom Wypych, James Strawson, Vid Petrovic, Radley Angelo, Aliya Hoff, Matt Howland,

Abstract? We present our work in designing and deploying airborne sensor vehicles specifically for cultural heritage ap- plications. Numerous practical cultural heritage missions in survey, assessment, and conservation work can benefit from the utility of specializing commodity and customizable airborne platforms to collect visual and non-visual data. These systems and customizations therein have undergone several generations of development both in our own designs and in the research community at large. We discuss the historical application of airborne imaging to cultural heritage conservation and sur- veying as well as discuss the design evolution towards multi- rotor systems from conventional rotary-wing and fixed-wing systems. This discussion addresses the fundamental principles of operation, as well as the capabilities, contemporary methods and commodity components available for the implementation of such a system. We present our current system and its features in concert with example payloads of utility in conduct- ing these practical reconnaissance missions, as well as useful post-processing techniques, as well as future work in applied visualization.
