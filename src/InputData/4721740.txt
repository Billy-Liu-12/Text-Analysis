Analysis of Relationships between Color and Emotion by Classification based on Associations

Abstract?This paper studied the relationships between color attributes and emotional dimensions by classification based on associations. First psychological experiments were designed to gather users? emotional response to color images. 52 color samples chosen from CIE Lab Lch color spaces were displayed on the screen. 20 subjects were asked to report their emotional response in the form of valence and arousal on the Self- Assessment Manikin. Secondly, after preprocessing 42 cases were used to train by classification based on associations to find rules between color attributes and emotional dimensions. Then these rules were used to predict subjects? emotional response to a new color. A good result was obtained with correct prediction rate of 90.00% for arousal and 80.00% for valence.



I. INTRODUCTION  Color affects our emotions. Some colors make people happy, while others make people depressive. It would be interesting and worthwhile to study these relationships between color attributes and emotional dimensions and find some potential rules, which may be applied in many fields, such as fashion and Website design. So color-emotion has been increasingly researched in recent years.

J. H. Xin conducted visual experiments in 3 different regions, namely Hong Kong, Japan and Thailand. A set of 218 color samples were used to compare, 12 pairs of adjectives such as warm-cool, were adopted to represent user?s emotional responses. He found that the influences of lightness and chroma is much more important than that of the hue on the color emotions and there are good correlations of color emotions among these 3 regions[1].

Li-Chen Qu studied the color emotions for two-color combi- nations. 11 pairs of adjectives were investigated on 190 color pairs with British and Chinese observers. His experimental results showed that there existed gender difference but no significant cultural difference between British and Chinese cul- tural, and confirmed an additivity relationship between single- color and color-combination emotions[2]. He also developed 3 color preference models for single colors[3].

50 subjects from various age groups were asked to match a list of adjectives with the proper color samples in Banu Manav?s study. The result indicated that there was a strong dependence between the choice and use of color at residence;  they also found that emotional responses to colors changed with lightness and saturation levels[4].

In Nag KAYA studies, 10 fully saturated chromatic colors chosen from the Munsell color system were used to examine color-emotion association. Apart from these ten hue groups, three achromatic colors (white, black and gray) were also used.

98 volunteered college students participated in experiment.

The results revealed that a color-related emotion is highly dependent on personal preference and past experience.[5].

253 color pairs generated from a set of 23 single colors were used in Suchitra Sueeprasan?s study. 34 observers identified color sensation induced by each color pair using 14 opponent- word pairs. Their results showed that there were some rela- tionships between two color sensation scales[6].

Xiao-Ping Gao?s study investigated the relationship between color attributes and color emotions from 7 different region groups. 214 color samples were used to evaluate on 12 emotional variables. The analysis showed that chroma and lightness are the most important factors on color emotion, whereas the influences of hue and cultural background were very limited[7].

Dekan carried out 4 experiments to describe emotional responses to color and analyze the relationship between color attributes and emotional dimensions. One-way repeated mea- surements ANOVA and correlation analysis were used to ana- lyze the results, he found that chroma is positively correlated with all emotional dimensions in four experiments[8].

From above, it can be seen that current studies except Dekan use opponent adjectives to describe subjects emotional response. However, the semantic meaning of an adjective is user-depend, while valence and arousal may reflect users? emotional response more directly. Further more, all of these researches only obtain some qualitative results, which can not be used to predict subjects? emotional response to a new color.

In this paper, valence and arousal were adopted to describe users? emotional responses to color samples in our psycholog- ical experiments. 52 color stimuli chosen from CIE Lab Lch color spaces were displayed on the screen, 20 subjects were asked to report their emotional response. After psychological experiments, the method of classification based on associations   DOI 10.1109/CSSE.2008.1207     were used to analyze the relationships between color attributes and emotional dimensions. Several quantitative rules were obtained. Then these rules were used to predict subjects? emotional response to a new color stimulus.

A. Psychological Experiments  52 color stimuli chosen from the CIE Lab Lch color space which is a device-independent were used to induce subject?s emotional response.

25 color stimuli of dekan?s study listed in Table I were referenced[8], but these color samples did not include some common colors such as gray, white and black. Therefore, we added other twenty-seven color samples as showed in Table II.

A 9-pointed rating scale for each dimension were selected. 9 represents highest, and 1 represents lowest.

B. Training stimuli  To make subjects understand the meaning of the valence and arousal, 7 pictures chosen from IAPS (International Affective Picture System) listed in table III, were also used as stimuli.

In addition, 4 another color stimuli listed in table II were selected. In order to make subjects get familiar with these ex- periments, the subjects were asked to rate emotional responses.

Subject  20 college students including 18 males and 2 females participated in experiment, whose ages ranged from 20 to 29, and the averaged age was 23.95. None of them had achromatopsia.

D. Procedure  Firstly, the subjects were told the meaning of the valence and arousal, and the relation between their distribution and 4 basic emotions (happy, fear, sad and calm).

Secondly, 7 IAPS pictures were displayed on CRT monitor.

Thirdly, 4 training color stimuli were displayed on the same  monitor, the subject was asked to write down the value of valence and arousal to each color sample on SAM.

Lastly, 52 color stimuli were randomly displayed on moni- tor, each color stimulus was displayed only once till the subject pressed any key to display the next. There was no time limit between two stimuli. The subject was asked to write down the value of valence and arousal to each color stimulus on SAM.

After the experiment, 20 subjects?s emotional responses to each color stimulus were averaged according to the follow equations. Thus, a sample sets including 52 cases were ob- tained.

Vj =  Num?  i=1  SAM ij1  Num , j = 1, 2, ..., 52, Num = 20  SAM ij1 is the ith subject ?s valence to the jth color  Aj =  Num?  i=1  SAM ij2  Num , j = 1, 2, ..., 52, Num = 20  SAM ij2 is the ith subject ?s arousal to the jth color

II. ANALYSIS BY CBA  The CBA is a data mining tool focusing on mining class association rules based on frequent items. It had been used for mining rules from varies kinds of data sets efficiently.

In CBA, there are two types of mining strategies which are Classification Mining and Association Mining. In this paper, the CBA was used to mine the rules between color attributes and emotional dimensions, not the interrelationship among color attributes. Therefore, we adopted the Classification Min- ing to exert our experiments, and took the two emotional dimensions as the class attribute respectively. The generated rules were used to predict the emotional response to new color stimuli.

In total 52 cases, 42 cases were selected to train by CBA to generate the rules, and the left 10 cases were used to     predict using the generated these rules. The framework of our experiment is showed in Fig 1.

Fig. 1. The framework of our experiment  A. Preprocessing  In the analysis by CBA, classification techniques can be applied to the relation database table which has a set of attributes. In the experiment, lightness, chroma and hue were attributes; valence and arousal were the class.

First, all these attributes and classes should be discretized.

Lightness was divided into 5 groups, 20 degree per group, so it had 5 attribute values which were 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Chroma was divided into 7 groups, 20 degree per group, so it had 7 attribute values which were 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Hue was divided into 10 groups by their semantic according to the order of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet, gray, black and white.

Because the 9-pointed rating scale was too meticulous to distinguish the emotion, the 9-pointed rating scale was changed into the 3-pointed rating scale. In 3-pointed rating scale, level 1 was less than 4, which denoted negative and sleeping; level 2 ranged from 4 to 6, which denoted neutral; level 3 was more than 6, which denoted exciting and happy.

Fig 2 was the histogram of the number of valence and arousal which were divided into the 9-pointed rating scale.

From Fig 2, it could be seen that valence ranges from 3 to 6, while arousal from 3 to 7. Fig 3 was the histogram of the number of valence and arousal which were divided into 3 scales. As depicted in Fig 3, it can seen that most of the distributed in level 1 and 2. Compared to Fig 2 and Fig 3, it can be seen that distributions in these the 9-pointed rating scale and the 3-pointed rating scale were coincident, which means that the impacts of the change to our experiment were acceptable.

In the analysis by CBA, the minimum confidence was set to 50.00%, and minimum support was set to 1.00%. For minimum support, it was more complex because it had a strong effect on the quality of the classifier produced. If it was set to high, those possible rules that cannot satisfy minimum sport but with confidence would not be included[10-11]. In some study, it was set to 1%?2%, we set it to 1%. ?If the confidence is greater than minimum confidence, we say the rule is accurate?[10].

B. The relationships between valence and 3 color attributes  42 cases which included lightness, chroma, hue and valence were input to the CBA. After learning, 6 rules listed in table  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9         valence  nu m  be r  The number of 9 point of valence  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9            arousal  nu m  be r  The number of 9 point of arousal  Fig. 2.

The valence and arousal distribution in 3-pointed rating scale  IV had been discovered .

TABLE IV THE RULES BETWEEN LIGHTNESS, CHROMA, HUE AND VALENCE  No Rule conf% Sup%  Rule 1 Lightness=5,Hue = 3 ?>class = 2 100.00% 9.52% Rule 2 Lightness=3 ?>class = 2 91.67% 26.19% Rule 3 Chroma=4 ?>class = 2 90.00% 21.43% Rule 4 Lightness=2 ?>class = 1 87.50% 16.67% Rule 5 Hue=4?>class=2 85.71% 14.29% Rule 6 Hue=7 ?>class = 2 85.71% 14.29%  In this table, a rule listed as the follow format: conditions ?> result, which means that if the condition was satisfied, then the result is acquired, and conf% was used to indicate the confidence and the sup% was the support.

As show in Table IV, if chroma had value 3 and lightness had value 5 or lightness had value 3 or chroma had value 4 or hue had value 4 or hue had value, it would lead to the class 2.

If lightness had value 2, it would lead to the class 1.

Next, these rules were used to predict, the left 10 cases     were used to test its performance, then 8 cases were correctly predicted, the over correct rate was 80.00%.

C. The relationships between arousal and 3 color attributes  42 cases which included lightness, chroma, hue and arousal were input to the CBA. After learning, 17 rules listed in the Table V had been discovered .

TABLE V THE RULES BETWEEN LIGHTNESS, CHROMA, HUE AND AROUSAL  No Rule conf% Sup%  Rule 1 Hue=8 ?>class=1 100.00% 7.14% Rule 2 Lightness = 4,Chroma = 1 ?>class = 1 100.00% 7.143% Rule 3 Chroma=6 ?>class=3 100.00% 4.76% Rule 4 Lightness=4 ?>class=2 100.00% 4.76% Rule 5 Chroma=3,Hue=4 ?>class=1 100.00% 4.76% Rule 6 Lightness=3,Hue=7 ?>class=1 100.00% 4.76% Rule 7 Lightness=4,Hue=3 ?>class=1 100.00% 4.76% Rule 8 Chroma=3,Lightness=5 ?>class=2 100.00% 4.762% Rule 9 Hue=4,Chroma=7 ?>class=3 100.00% 2.38% Rule 10 Hue=3,Chroma=5 ?>class=3 100.00% 2.381% Rule 11 Chroma=2 ?>class=1 90.00% 21.43% Rule 12 Chroma=4 ?>class=2 85.71% 14.29% Rule 13 Lightness=2 ?>class=1 83.33% 11.91% Rule 14 Lightness=3, chroma=3 ?>class=3 71.43% 11.91% Rule 15 Lightness=5 ?>class=2 62.50% 11.91% Rule 16 Chroma=3 ?>class=1 61.54% 19.05% Rule 17 Hue=6 ?>class=2 57.14% 9.52%  As showed in Table V, if the hue had value 8 or lightness had value 4 and chroma had value 1 or hue had value 4 and chroma had value 3 or hue had value 7 and lightness had value 3 or hue had value 3 and lightness had value 4 or chroma had value 2 or 3 or lightness had value 2, it would lead to class 1.

If the lightness had value 4 or chroma had lightness 3 and lightness had value 5 or chroma had value 4 or hue had value 6, it would lead to class 2.

If the chroma had value 6 or chroma had value 3 and lightness had value 3, it would lead to class 3.

Next these rules were used to predict, the left 10 cases were used to test its performance, then 9 cases were correctly predicted, the over correct rate was 90.00%.

It can been seen that the two correct prediction rates is higher than 50.00%. That is to say, the relationships between color attributes and emotional dimension are not random. In general, some relationships do exist between color attributes and emotional dimension.



III. CONCLUSION  Color affects our emotions and feelings. It is worthwhile to study the relationships between color attributes and emotional dimensions. In this paper, psychological experiments were designed to gather user?s emotional response to color samples.

CBA were used to discover rules between color attributes and emotional dimensions; then these rules were used to predict valence and arousal of emotion response to a new color  stimulus. A good result was obtained with correct prediction rate of 90.00% for arousal and 80.00% for valence.

This paper analyzed the relationships between color at- tributes and user?s emotional response. Next, we will further analyze the impacts of the color attributes to the user?s physiological responses. These result could be directly applied in many fields.
