I.  INTRODUCTION With the changing means of network intrusion, the  traditional intrusion detection models are very difficult to detect the complex and unknown intrusion methods. Data mining can extract the interesting knowledge which is the implicit, unknown and potentially useful information from the database. The intrusion detection system based on data mining can automatically build the laconically and precisely normal characteristic contour of the system from a large number of network data. It has solved the difficulties of rule extraction and coding in a traditional misuse-based intrusion detection system. Because of its generality (it can handle a variety of structured data) and its automatic processing function in our scheme, the corresponding intrusion detection systems can be built in many different network environments. The research and development of distributed network intrusion detection system based on data mining has important theoretical consequences and applied value.

Many achievements have been made in the research of intrusion detection technologies based on data mining both at home and overseas, and some intrusion detection models are proposed. On the basis of analysis and research on the existing models, the architecture model of the distributed network intrusion detection system based on association rule mining is put forward, the key algorithm is discussed, and the experimental results are analyzed in the paper.



II. SYSTEM-STRUCTURE MODEL The distributed intrusion detection system based on  association rule mining shows as figure 2.1. The system has three layers: local layer, network layer and system layer. Data acquisition analyzer and data mining detector constitute a  single detection engine, which distributes in the LAN key nodes, monitors the whole net-segment data, responds to the intrusion activities and sends alarm messages to the alarm optimizer. The alarm optimizer collects all the alarm messages sent by detection engines in the LAN, and stores them into the logger. The central control platform is located in the system layer, and provides a friendly and visual control interface to the administrator.

III. ALGORITHM FOR ASSOCIATION RULE MINING Association rule mining is to find the rules which meet the  constraints of minimum support and minimum confidence from the database. For a set of items and a record set, the correlations among the items are derived from analyzing the record set. The main target for association rule mining is transactional database. Confidence and support are usually used to describe the properties of association rules.

Assume I={i1?i2???im} is a set of data, called itemset, of which the element is referred to as item. D is a set of transaction T, of which each transaction T is a set of items, then T ? I. there is a identification number TID for each transaction. It is a subset of itemset I. Thus a transaction can be expressed as T=?TID?It?. Assume A is a set of data item, if and only if A ? T, then transaction T includes A.

An association rule is a implication such as A?B. Here A ? I, B ? I, and A ? B= ? . If A ? B is true in the transactional database D, and the number of transactions which contain A? B in D accounts for s% of the total number of transactions in D, shown as Support?A?B?= s%, then rule A?B has support s. If c% of the transactions containing A in D contain B, shown as Confidence?A?B?= c%, then rule A?B has confidence c. Generally people are only interested in the association rules which meet certain support and confidence, so association rule mining is to generate all the rules, support and confidence of which are respectively larger than the given minimum support(min-sup) and minimum confidence(min-conf).

An improved FP-Growth(frequent-pattern growth) algorithm for association rule mining is applied in the paper.

FP-Growth algorithm is an algorithm using a pattern growth for frequent mode mining instead of producing a candidate set.

It compresses the database providing frequent itemsets into a frequent pattern tree which keeps all the items to meet the minimum support, and divides the compressed database into a group of conditional databases, each of which associates a frequent item, then mines each conditional database respectively.

FP-Growth algorithm recursively generates conditional FP- tree during frequent pattern mining. When each frequent pattern is produced, a conditional FP-tree is generated. Under a low minimum support, even to a very small database, it will generate hundreds of thousands frequent patterns, consequently a great number of conditional FP-trees will be produced. It will cost a great many of system time and space. In addition, FP- tree and conditional FP-tree need bidirectional traversal. It will occupy larger memory space. FP-Growth algorithm is not efficient in time and space, and it needs improving.

In the paper improvements are made against the disadvantage of FP-Growth algorithm, and the structure of single linked list is introduced during frequent pattern mining.

Improved FP-tree is unidirectional, and each node only keeps the point pointing to its parent node, which saves the tree space. The trace information of different nodes of the identical item is compressed into the single linked list of this item, which avoids generating node chains and conditional pattern  pool, and remarkably improves mining efficiency. The algorithm shows as follows:  Input: Transaction database DB, minimum support min_support  Output: complete set of frequent patterns ?Scan the database DB once, and get the set F of frequent  items as well as their support. Sort F by support descending order, and write in the frequent item header table-head_table.

?Scan the database DB once again, for each transaction of DB, perform the following steps:  a) Sort the frequent items of transaction by descending order of head_table, and write the sorted frequent items in the double linked list-Item_Linklist.

b) Call insert_table (Item_Linklist, head_table), the procedure performs as follows: insert_table (Item_Linklist, head_table) {  // n is the node number of Item_Linklist, Ni is the node i of Item_Linklist  i=2; // begin with the second node of Item_Linklist  for (i?n) { j = i; // Reversely traverse the nodes before node Ni  in Item_Linklist. ? is the single linked list whose head pointer is node Ni of head_table.

for (j>1) { If ? contains the node Nj-1 Nj-1 . count= Nj-1 . count + 1 else { If ? contains node ? which is before node  Nj-1 by the order of head_table Insert node Nj-1 before node ?,  Nj-1 . count = 1; else  Add node Nj-1 at the end of ?, Nj-1 . count = 1;  } j = j - 1; } i = i + 1; }}  ? Traverse each singe linked list whose head pointer is the node of head_table, then the complete set of frequent patterns meeting the minimum support-min_support can be mined.



IV. SYSTEM EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS  The data set of network intrusion detection in KDDCup99 [1]  is chosen for the experiment. By the assistance of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, The MIT Lincoln Laboratory built the experimental network according to the LAN structure of the US air force. Imitating the normal use of the network, they designedly carried out attacks. The recorded data such as flow log and host file system image are given to the IDS taking part in the evaluation for off-line analysis.

Three groups of data are formed respectively to imitate three situations of less, medium and more attacking activities in an actual network environment. The detailed circumstances of each group of data are shown in Table 4.1.

According to the improved FP-Growth algorithm, the three groups of training data in Table 4.1 are respectively learned and trained, then abnormal patterns are extracted and the rule base is formed. The experiments are carried out with the testing data sets, and experimental results are shown in Table 4.2.

The experimental results of the FP-Growth algorithm without improvement are shown in Table 4.3.

From the experimental results, we conclude that three sets of training time are reduced by 51.11%, 52.94% and 55.09% respectively according to the improved FP-Growth algorithm, which can greatly improve detection efficiency of a system.

For each group of data, the improved algorithm increases the detection ratio, reduces the false positive ratio and the false negative ratio. The detection performance has been improved greatly.
