Abstract?  Spacecraft are complex systems that involve  different subsystems and multiple relationships among them.

The design of a spacecraft is an evolutionary process that starts  from requirements and evolves across different design phases.

During this process, a lot of changes can happen and affect  mass and power at component level, at subsystem level, and  even at system level. Each spacecraft has to respect overall  constraints in terms of mass and power: for this reason, it's  important to be sure that the design does not exceed these  limitations. Current practice in system modeling primarily  deals with this problem allocating margins. However, a  statistical characterization of the fluctuations in mass and  power in the early design phases is missing. This lack of  statistical characterization would result either in a risky  spacecraft design that might not fit the mission constraints and  requirements, or in a conservative design that might not fully  utilize the available resources.  The authors have previously  developed a mathematical approach ( [1] [2] [3] [4]) to quantify  the likelihood that the major design drivers of mass and power  of a space communication system would meet the spacecraft  and mission requirements and constraints through the mission  design lifecycle. The methodology uses a combination of  statistics based on data and probabilities assessed by experts in  the field. Additionally, the methodology is innovative in the  approach developed to elicit experts? opinions [5] which allows  the analyst to identify biases or mis-calibrations which can  affect the final estimation. The work presented in this paper  extends the approach developed to the entire spacecraft design,  focusing on small spacecraft (less than 50 Kg mass) due to the  recent interest in the space community in such platforms. The  spacecraft is analyzed in its subsystems and related  components. A database is constructed to compute data  statistics. An interview process to elicit expert opinions in all  the areas of spacecraft design is developed and the results are  presented. A test case made of a small satellite mission  (CASTOR) is presented and the results are described.
