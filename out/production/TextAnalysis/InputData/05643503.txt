Using Association Rules for Discovering Tag Bundles in Social Tagging Data

Abstract?Social tagging has become very popular with the rise of Web 2.0, making it an important piece of the puzzle that makes up the web phenomenon. In contrast to more elaborate ways of organizing resources, such as taxonomies or ontologies, tagging is very easy to use and understand.

Because of its simplicity tagging does not create explicit, formalized, structures. By applying a well-established data mining algorithm we show how common structures in form of tag bundles (a set of related tags) can automatically be derived from a bag of tags. Based on these computed tag bundles tagging applications can assist users with improved user interfaces by introducing user based semantic labelling.

For navigating and searching his or her tagged information space there are certainly better user interface elements possible than a tag cloud or a plain list of tags ordered by frequency.

We propose that combining frequently associated tags into a tag bundle is such a way. We have tested our approach on a data set gained from Delicious and evaluated it by utilizing the Normalized Google Distance.

I. INTRODUCTION  Fueled by the wild growth of social media, an increasing  amount of information can be found online. This results in  an increasingly fragmented and inhomogeneous body of data  being offered by social media sites.

In this context social tagging has become a very popular  tool for categorizing knowledge items over the last few years  [1], [2]. By allowing individuals to categorize and mark  their own data as well as data of others, an overview of  content with some personal relevance can be won. One of  the first social tagging applications was Delicious1, a social  bookmarking platform. Many other Internet services such  as Flickr, Last.fm, 43things, Citeulike or Bibsonomy2, make  1http://www.delicious.com/ 2http://www.flickr.com/, http://www.last.fm/,  http://www.43things.com/, http://www.bibsonomy.org/  use of tagging for structuring their content.

But since the information is being categorized by many  individuals who do not necessarily share a common under-  standing of all or even a part of the subject matter, the  challenge of interpreting tags in large group or corporate  contexts has been of developing interest. First of all social  tagging follows very heterogeneous and individual usage  patterns. Each user and each application has different char-  acteristics. In general one can observe a long tail distribution  of tag frequencies [3]. This means that users tend to employ  some tags very frequently and a huge number of tags very  infrequently. Having many different tags leads to informa-  tion scattering and therefore navigational interfaces based on  unfiltered tags quickly become very inefficient. This applies  both to simple lists of tags that are either in an alphabetical  order or sorted based on the frequency of a tag. Tag clouds,  as alternative representation, display only an excerpt of the  more commonly used tags.

A related challenge is presented by the variety of reasons  motivating tagging in an information system. Golder and Hu-  berman [4] identify seven possible functions: (i) Identifying  what (or who) a document is about, (ii) Identifying what  the document itself is, (iii) Identifying who owns the docu-  ment, (iv) Refining documents or other tags, (v) Identifying  qualities or characteristics, (vi) Self reference and (vii) Task  organising.

Similar, Marlow et al. [1] describe incentives and moti-  vations for users to annotate resources with tags: (i) Future  retrieval, (ii) Contribution and sharing, (iii) Attract Atten-  tion, (iv) Play and Competition, (v) Self Presentation and  (vi) Opinion Expression. From these enumerations one can  see that the usage of tagging is manifold. The personal  information aspects are easily recognized by taking the  individual nature of social tagging into account, especially  the motivation ?Future retrieval?. For a lot of cases a user  wants to organize his or her personal information items     (bookmarks, pictures, books, bibliography, notes, etc.).

Additionally with the advent of social software as knowl-  edge management tools in companies ? sometimes referred  to as enterprise 2.0 [5] ? organizing tagged information on a  larger scale and also in a professional working environment  has become an important issue. Organizing in this context  means creating some structures which provide a certain  degree of stability to tagging activities. Technically this  translates into the need to derive structures from tag sets.

We believe that it is nearly impossible to automatically  generate complex formalizations such as ontologies or even  elaborated taxonomies from social tagging data. Therefore  we direct our efforts towards simpler structures and use tag  bundles as a starting point. In Delicious tag bundles are a  way to group tags. This helps to aggregate resources tagged  with the individual tags contained in the corresponding tag  bundle. But since a user has to define these bundles manually  the average user typically does not make use of this feature.

The approach presented in this paper is focused on the  extraction of semantic commonalities in tagging behavior,  and draws on parallels used to discover item sets of interest  in a ?grab bag environment? ?precisely the mentioned tag  bundles.



II. RELATED WORK  Finding structures in social tagging data has received  quite some attention in recent work. Begelman et al. [6]  describe a method for clustering social tagging data based on  the co-occurrence values of tags. The co-occurrence values,  meaning that two tags have been used together in a tag  assignment, is used as a similarity measure in the applied  clustering algorithm. Brooks et al. [7] follow an analo-  gous approach. Additionally they apply an agglomerative  clustering for computing a hierarchy of tag clusters. Other  examples for clustering tag sets can be found in [3], [8],  [9], [10]. Xu et al. [11] describe a goodness measure for tag  suggestions.

Heymann et al. [12] use association rule mining based  in combinations with other measures for link prediction  on social tags. In contrast to our approach they perform  association rule mining based on tag assignments for a  certain URL without distinguishing between different users.

We consider tag assignments on a individual basis targeting  the organization of personal tag spaces.

Schmitz et al. [13] describe the idea of using associa-  tion rules to determine hypernymy and hyponymy relations  between tags in social tagging data. They have a strong  emphasis on formal concept analysis and its usage in context  of social tagging data.

Although we are following a similar initial thought of  utilizing classical data mining techniques for discovering  structures in folksonomies our focus is on structuring tags in  a less formal and sharp-edged manner. Our aim is to suggest  to the user tag bundles for organizing tagged information  objects. The idea is that tag assignments assigned by any  given user are a reflection of his understanding and ?taxon-  omy? of the subject at hand. By using the tags occurring in  common sets an accurate picture of relationships between  tags and their user perceived ?taxonomy? can be gained. By  constructing tag bundles with a common root tag a subject  grouping can be seen.



III. DISCOVERING TAG BUNDLES  Tagging behavior, as opposed to keyword extraction from  text, is geared towards the complete and succinct description  of content and the organization of documents for a keyword  based search. A user will distribute tags on several granular-  ities, for instance ?java? to describe more general concepts  and ?bean? for specific uses.

By discovering the usage of such broadly descriptive  terms in combination with other more specific terms a tag  bundle can be created which gathers all specifics to a general  term into a set. This set reflects the conceptual taxonomy and  associated documents from a user perspective.

Tag bundles stem from personal information  management[14], e.g. used when organizing a blog  (can consist of many posts when used as a notepad) or  bookmarks. This creates an individual tag space associated  with every user which is dependant on his or her own  viewpoint. While general concepts are easy to reconcile  across worldviews, specifics tend to be perceived in a  slightly different light. Tag bundles can help to reconcile  concepts with each other by offering the general terms as a  bridge between user perceptions.

Conversely the same tag can appear in different tag  bundles of a single user, reflecting the different meanings  of a term. Such overlapping bundles shows tags used in  different contexts, e.g. java can be placed in a bundle books  together with other book related tags such as ?tutorial? or  ?toread? as well as in a bundle programming together with  tags such as ?tools? or ?tips?. Additionally the problem of  ambiguous meanings of tags, such as challenge presented by  acronyms and homonyms3, must be considered. Depending  on the context, a tag with several meanings can occur  in several tag bundles, each representing different topical  collections of resources.

A. Social Tagging  In most current work social tagging data is also referred  to as a folksonomy [15]. A folksonomy is a portmanteau  consisting of the words taxonomy and the word folk. The  term refers to the implicit structures (therefore taxonomy4)  between entities emerging from the individual tagging be-  haviour (therefore folk).

3Acronyms: ?GIS? can stand e.g. for ?Geographic information system?, ?Greenland ice sheet? or ?Gruppo di Intervento Speciale?; homonyms: ?java? can e.g. stand for the programming language or the island  4Taxonomy actually can be considered as the wrong expression since there are no real hierarchical structures present.

We define a folksonomy similar to the definition given by  Hotho et al. [16]:  Definition 1: A folksonomy is a tuple F := (U, T,R, Y ) where  ? U , T and R are finite sets, whose elements are called  users, tags and resources, resp.

? Y is a ternary relation between them, i. e. Y ? U ? T ?R, called tag assignments.

In general a folksonomy contains n-ary relations between  user, tags and resources. Additionally sometimes the system,  meaning the tagging application in which the individual  tag assignment occurred, is also considered [17]. For the  sake of simplicity we intentionally exclude the system as a  participant in this paper.

B. Tag Bundles  The goal of this paper is to distill tag bundles B consisting  of tags for a user. A tag bundle consists of a head with  the most important tag being the common denominator  for the linked resources. Additionally there is a set with  sub-tags which are more specific and can reflect different  aspects of the resources in question. An example can be  seen in figure 2. By using the relationship between tags  associated with a resource we seek to discover tag bundles  in user tagging. Not only do tags elucidate the content  of a document, but the same tags are also in a semantic  relationship with each other simply by being used to describe  the same source of information.

C. Association Rule Mining for Bundle Discovery  Association Rule Mining (ARM) is a popular data mining  method. Association rules have been extensively studied  in the literature. However most widely used algorithms  are based on the original a-priori algorithm proposed by  Agrawal et al [18].

A typical application of ARM is the analysis of trans-  action data recorded by point-of-sale (POS) systems in  supermarkets. The results are, e.g. integrated in the decision  process of how to arrange items in a supermarket. This  sometimes leads to surprising results. Observations in a  grocery store show that people who buy diapers also buy  beer [19]. Based on that insight diapers can then be placed  together with beer. In analogy to grouping items that are  bought together frequently we are trying to group frequently  used tags together so that the represented resources (book-  marks, documents, etc.) can be more easily accessed.

Association rules are in general of the form:  X ?? Y [Support,Confidence]  Support is the number of transactions containing both X and Y. A transaction for the super market example consists of the items a customer has bought together at exactly one  visit. Confidence stands for P (Y|X), meaning how likely Y  is given X. Given a minimum support association rules can be computed with the algorithm described by Agrawal.

A tagging, meaning a user has tagged an entity with  several tags, is our special type of transaction.

Based on these tagging transaction rules of the form  {xi1, . . . , xik} ?? yi [Support,Confidence] where xij ? T and yi ? T are computed.

By restricting the set of generated association rules with  thresholds for support (minSup) and minimum confidence  (minConfidence) only a selection of rules is considered as  input for the target bundles. In a final step the rules are  joined into bundles if they share the same head yi.

Computed association rules have the following form, for  example:  {management, crisis, failure} ?? finance [ 0.5, 60 ]  or  {history, trust} ?? finance [ 0.7, 20 ]  In this example both rules have the same head and are  therefore merged into a bundle:  {management, crisis, failure, history, trust} ?? finance  Depending on the individual tagging behaviour and the  parameter thresholds there are a number of tag bundles  discovered. The resulting tag bundles can function as a  suggestion for a user on how to organize his or her personal  tags.



IV. EVALUATION  We have applied our approach on social tagging data  extracted from internal knowledge management tools at  Siemens (a blogging platform [20] and a wiki [21]). These  applications are widely used within Siemens. The results  are very promising, but since the amount of available data  does not nearly reach the numbers obtained in Internet usage  we decided to evaluate our approach on data collected from  Delicious.

A. Dataset  During a period of about eight weeks (end January -  March 2009) we periodically fetched the RSS feeds for the  bookmarks of 2300 randomly chosen users of the popular  bookmarking service Delicious. During this time period  three accounts where removed and 27 users did not assign  any tags, which leads to a total number of 2270 investigated  users. The total number of resources for all users aggregate  to 462,415 (with duplicates), of which 345,674 unique  resources form R.

The number of resources tagged by a user range from a  single resource (three users) to over 1,000 different resources  (eight users). Surprisingly these eight users were not spam  and we could also not detect any spam resources in our  sample set. In average there were 201 resources per user.

For some more details about the data set see [22].

Figure 1: Histogram: Number of distinct tags vs number of  user.

There where 2,942,633 tags in total and 97,522 uniquely  different tags forming our tag set T . While 27 users did not  display any tagging activity, the average number of different  tags per user was 201. The median of different tags per user  was 165. One hyperactive user registered 3328 distinct tags.

For a graphical representation of the number of distinct tags  against the number of users having used the corresponding  number of distinct tags see figure 1. We observed a typical  long tail distribution of tags [3].

B. Preprocessing  For cleaning the social tagging data we applied only a  conversion to lower case. We did not apply stemming since  it depends on the language used, and first tests have shown  that language detection on tags remains inconclusive. This  may be because tags are typically very specific and often just  a simple phrase. We did not utilize a thesaurus because the  overlap of tags and a thesaurus such as WordNet is expected  to be low. When it comes to mapping tags to concepts in  WordNet, Laniado et al. state that only 8% of the different  tags in their data sample (480,000 different tags collected  from 30,000 Delicious users) find a corresponding concept  in WordNet [23].

C. Association Rule mining  We have used three different parameter threshold: (0.5,  8), (0.7, 4) and (0.9, 3) (confidence and minimum support).

We selected these parameter thresholds based on preliminary  experiments where we tried to get a feeling for which  thresholds are practical.

D. Bundles  Depending on the characteristics of the individual tagging  data we compute users with bundles: For (0.5, 8): 825, (0.7,  4): 1207 and (0.9, 3): 1330. It was not possible to derive tag  bundles for users if they did not repeatedly use more than  one or two tags per resource or if they used many different  tags. Association rule mining can not be utilized to derive  tag bundles in these cases.

Table I shows the statistics for the generated tag bundles.

For (0.5, 8) there tend to be less tags per bundle, since the  threshold for the minimum support is rather high. There are  less rules created, but rules are more easily accepted as a  finance  systems  uk  belief  trust  confidence  learning  business  risk  history  politics  cognitive  failure  psychology  money  wealth  economics  crisis  management  growth  Figure 2: Example Tag Bundle for finance (From the test  run with Confidence > 0.7 and MinSupport > 4)  base for a bundle. Also there are less users whose bundles  could be computed. (0.7, 4) and (0.9, 3) have more tags per  bundle and the number of users with derived tag bundles is  higher.

In Figure 2 an example of a tag bundle is shown. In  this bundle all computed rules with the head ?finance? are  merged together. Contained in the tag bundle are tags such  as ?failure?, ?risk?, ?economics? or ?crisis? indicating that  the user for whom this bundle was created, seemed to be  interested in resources related to the current financial crisis  (the data was collected in early 2009).

E. Normalized Google Distance  In order to determine if the derived tag bundles provide  useful grouping of tags, we use the Normalized Google  Distance (NGD) [24] as measurement for the semantic  relatedness of two terms. NGD takes advantage of the  number of hits returned by Google to compute the semantic     Table I: Statistics for generated Bundles.

The basic idea behind NGD is  that if you have two terms, you first query Google for each  term separately and set the number of returned results in  relation to the number of results returned by a query using  both terms together.

Given two search terms x and y, the normalised Google  distance between x and y, NGD(x, y), can be obtained as follows  NGD(x, y) = max{log f(x), log f(y)} ? log f(x, y)  logM ?min{log f(x), log f(y)}  where f(x) is the number of Google hits for the search term x, f(y) is the number of Google hits for the search term y, f(x, y) is the number of Google hits for the tuple of search terms x y and M is the number of web pages indexed by  Google5.

Table II shows the statistical characteristics of the NGD  values between the tag bundle head and the bundled tags.

The first three rows show the results for ARM with different  parameter combinations. For each bundle head the normal-  ized google distance to each tag contained in the tag bundle  is computed. The arithmetic average over each tag bundle for  each user is for each parameter threshold setting about 0.4.

For putting the determined NGDs into context we computed  the pairwise NGD for two samples of five hundred randomly  selected tags. The last two rows contain the pairwise NGD  of these two runs. The expected value (?) of the random  tags is noticeable bigger than the expected values of the  experiments. Although this is no proof ?with an excessive  empirical bases? it still gives a strong indication that the  (semantic) similarity between the head of the tag bundles is  higher than the (semantic) similarity between random tags.

number of request per second to perform a test with a larger  set of random tags.



V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK  We have shown that it is possible to compute tag bundles  out of social tagging data by applying a popular association  rule mining algorithm. One problem with the described  approach is that association rule mining does not scale very  well for big data sources. For very large data sets it might  be promising to use map reduce [25] methods in order to  increase scalability. For some users with a certain tagging  gusto it was also not possible to determine tag bundles. Other  association rule mining algorithms [26] might deliver better  results or results with other characteristics. We are planning  to incorporate bundles into user interface design. Bundles  can also be a starting point for piled user interfaces [27].

Our next step is to incorporate our approach for organizing  tagged information in the existing social software landscape  at Siemens. This helps us to gain an insight into the  usefulness of generated bundles for the average user in an  enterprise environment.
