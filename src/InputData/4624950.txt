Risk Analysis of the Association Rules in the Incremental Mining Based on the  Weighted Model

Abstract   This paper presents the weighted model in the incremental mining algorithm and proposes risk analysis of the strong association rules for trend forecasting. We also analyze the risk degree of the lost rules based on the incremental mining. In practical application, the new method improves the precision of the incremental mining and efficiently uses the mining results for the factual decision-making and trend forecasting.

1. Introduction   Data Ming means extracting potential and valuable  information from a mass of data and forecasting development trends. Data mining is the new field with fast development, and it is the crossover application field of many study fields. Data mining is very important for the decision-making system in every walk of life.

Association rules mining in transaction data is the important portion of data mining research.

Aprior algorithm is the way that is commonly used for mining association rules? frequent item set. But it mostly finds association rules from the static information database. In factual application, this algorithm has some shortcoming. The paper analyzes the change of the strong association rules with data updating in database by incremental mining algorithm according to factual need of decision-making. We analyze the strong association rules by the weighted model and consider the risk degree of the lost association rules. Accordingly, we improve the significance of incremental updating association rules mining and efficiently forecast the trend of rules.

2. Incremental mining algorithm   Apriori algorithm is the way that mines and analyzes  the static information data. When the data in database keeps invariability, it is useful. But when the data is changed, it needs to scan the new database over again for adapting the increase of data in database. With the updating of the database, the original rules are not likely to keep identical. In the modern data management circumstance that information increases rapidly, it results in much repeated work and over-load of database?s  operation. And it wastes the original result obtained by old database mining.

We use the incremental mining algorithm to mend the original algorithm. The incremental mining algorithm takes full advantage of the old mining results and mines updating association rules with the incremental portion of the database. And it can efficiently decrease the database scanning times and sufficiently improved the efficiency of data mining. Suppose D  for the original database, and d for changing data set. The incremental updating of the association rules mostly means how to get association rules of D d?  when the new data set d  is added to the original database D   or d is deleted from D  with the changeless min-sup and the changeless min- cof(sometimes they can changed). For the incremental updating database, incremental mining concerns the following four instances of item set:(1)frequent in D , frequent in d , then frequent in D d? ;(2)frequent in D , not frequent in d , then uncertain in D d? ;(3)not frequent in D , frequent in d , then uncertain in D d? ;(4)not frequent in D , not frequent in d , then not frequent in D d? .

For satisfying high efficiency updating of association rules, it creates many kinds of data mining algorithm as FUP, IUA, AIUA, NEW FUP and FUFIA.

FUP algorithm solves (1), (2) and (4), but it can not solve the third. IUA and NEW FUP algorithm solve (3), but the efficiency isn't high.

3. Incremental updating association rules mining based on the weighted model   To solve the problem of updating association rules when min-sup is not change in incremental updating database, we use AIUA(advanced incremental updating algorithm) for incremental mining and find the strong association rules after database updating. We present a rule protection model with the weight on the basis of the original algorithm. This rule protection model with the weight will exert forecast function in the latter work of the incremental mining. Suppose 1W  and 2W  are the   DOI 10.1109/ICCSIT.2008.73    DOI 10.1109/ICCSIT.2008.73     weight of D  and d respectively. For association rule X Y? , we define the sup and cof. as the following[5]:  1 1  2 2  ( ) ( ) ( ), ( )  ( ) / ( )  Supp w X Y W Supp X Y W Supp X Y confw X Y  Supp w X Y Supp w X  = + ? =    ? i ? i ?  ?   Here, 1( )Supp X Y?  and 2 ( )Supp X Y?  are the rule?s X Y?  sup. in D  and d  respectively.

( )Suppw X Y?  and ( )confw X Y? are the rule`s X Y? sup. and con. in D d?  respectively.

For association rule X Y? , its sup. and cof. are defined as the following[5]:  1 1  1 1  ( ) ( ) ( ),  ( ) ( ) ( ),  n n  n n  Supp w X Y W Supp X Y W Supp X Y Confw X Y W Conf X Y W Conf X Y  = + +  ? = ? + + ?  ? ? ?   Here, ( )iSupp X Y? and ( )nConf X Y? are  rule?s( X Y? ) sup. and  cof. in incremental set iD .

First, we use AIUA( advanced incremental updating  algorithm ) to mend  incremental association rules when min-sup isn?t changed. The algorithm need respectively scan only once the original database and the new incremental database.

The algorithm is as the following [6]: Input: DB , the original transaction database  L , the set of DB ?s frequent item set db ;  0S , the min-sup Output: ''L , the set of DB db? ?s frequent item set (1) ''L ?=  for each X L?  do begin if X . count 0 (| | | |)L S DB db? ? + , then  { }'' ''L L X= + ; { }FL L X= ? ;  Else max max{ supp | }D i iS x D x L? =  ? end  (2) min 0 max 0( )d DS S t S S? ?= ? ? ? ; for each x db? do begin if x . count 0 (| | | |)db S DB db? ? + then  { }'' ''L L X= + ; { }db db x= ? ;  else  ' min{ | .

(| | | |)} i dL x db x count db S  DB db ?= ?  ? ?  +   end (3) for each FX L?  do begin for each 'x L? do begin if X . count FL X+ . count  ' 0 (| | | |)L S DB db? ? +  then '' '' { }L L X= + ' ' { }L L X= ?  else  { }F FL L X= ? end end (4) ' ' min 0{ | , }d dL L x S x Supd S?= ? ?  ? (5) if 'dL ?=  then output  ''L else for each 'dx L? ,do begin  max max{ supp | }d i iS x d x L? =  ?  min 0 max 01/ ( )D dS S t S S? ?= ? ? ? end end  (6) min( , )D k DL aproiri gen L S ?= ? (7) for each 'dx L?  do begin for each DX L?  do begin if X . count DL X+ . count  ' 0 (| | | |)dL S DB db? ? +  then " " { }L L X= +  else delete X end end (8) output "L   Here: X .count L , X .count db , X .count LF ,  X .count 'L , X .count LD  and X .count 'dL  are item set X  sup in L , db , LF , 'L , LD  and 'dL respectively.

Then, we calculate significative association rules? sup and cof in new database using the rule protection model with the weight. Calculate sup( x ) in D d? /sup( x ) in  1D ?  and cof( x ) in D d? / cof( x ) in 1D ? , then we get 1T  and 2T . Here we call themT . T  reflects change trend of the strong association rules on the basis of incremental mining. We analyze and forecast the useful association rules by the change trends with database     updating every time. Thereby, it supports the decision- making better.

On the other side, we study the lost rules that were the strong association rules in the original database after database updating. Calculate sup( x ) in D d?  and cof( x ) in D d? , and get T . The absolute value of T shows the eliminated risk when the strong association rules in the original database are changed with updating data. The absolute value of T  for the lost association rules, it is defined as risk degree of the lost. In practical application, people often concern the risk of the strong association rules in the original database, which is the risk of being weak with periodic increase of database. We can also regard the risk degree as the risk that the strong rules turn into the weak rules or the weak rules turn into the strong rules. Higher the risk degree is, lower the universality of the rule is. The introduction of risk degree is for the need of solving the practical problem. It forecasts the trends of association rules based on incremental mining from the different aspect and increases the reliability of forecasting.

We use the risk analysis to mend the original AIUA in data mining of TMIS (Traffic Management Information System) database. The result shows that the improved algorithm is better than the original algorithm. The application of the improved algorithm in Bank Data Analysis System and Enterprise Decision Support System has better effection. So, with the improved algorithm, we mend incremental data mining in database and can efficiently use association rules? trend analysis to improve the precision of the decision-making.

4. Conclusion   Aprior is a mining algorithm for static information data mining. AIUA is an incremental algorithm for mining incremental updating database. But AIUA can not find trends of association rules with the incremental updating data. The paper presents risk degree analysis of the strong association rules based on a model with the weight. In the process of incremental mining, we can forecast the trend of the rules better using the risk analysis.

This method improves the original algorithm because the tradition incremental mining uses only statistic method to maintain the database and ignores the trend of rules. The paper emphasizes the risk degree of the lost association rules; thereby it improves the significance of incremental mining and supports the decision-making.

In practical application, how to efficiently solve incremental updating problem of association rules in data mining when min-sup and min-cof are changed is the important study field. Furthermore, to mine and analyze the significative lost association rules more efficiently is also need more attention.
