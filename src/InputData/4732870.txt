Research of Study Early-warning Application based on Association Mining

Abstract   Because of its important application value in almost every region, early-warning has received extensive concern. This paper puts forward a study early-warning mechanism based on association rules. It uses an Apriori mining algorithm with some corresponding restrictions to dig out the latent school record association rules from former students' scores which are viewed as a history resource. Then these rules will be used to match up the data sets that need to monitor. Once a record is matched to one of these rules, the student of this record will receive an early-warning. This kind of early-warning mechanism changes the situation that problems with study can only be detected after knowing the scores. It has a predictable and forward-looking capability and has been proved to obtain a good early-warning effect during actual verification.

1. Introduction   Early-warning refers to giving forecast and alarm when things deviate from the normal track of development. The significance of early-warning is giving the necessary warning, steering and correcting of potential or existing windage, so that the notifier has enough time to pay attention to prevent problems and take corresponding countermeasures and response measures. The working principle of early-warning mechanism is as follows: the first step is to excavate corresponding rules used to judge whether it need to warn or not which is called early- warning rule; then use these rules to determine whether the current situation accord with these rules or not; if yes, the notifier will receive corresponding tips and warnings through appropriate channels.

Early-warning mechanism is first originated from military field[1], and then gradually entering into all walks of life including the field of education. In education, one of the most common applications is the study early- warning, which is used to supervise the study of students and give appropriate guidance and warning. For example, in Taiwan's colleges and universities, at the beginning of each semester, a list of students whose failed courses number meet or exceed 1/3 of the total number of courses  will be printed out. Then they will receive a warning in order to remind them to take corresponding countermeasures[2]. This early-warning mechanism is simple, but there are still deficiencies: first of all, this mechanism is an afterwit: only when the learner has failed can it give a warning. Second, such a warning mechanism lacks certain forward-looking ability, so it is hard to make accurate and effective forecasts about the situation on hand. The deep-seated reason of these deficiencies is that the early-warning rules which are gained from the existing data are too small and relatively simple, and do not have enough practical and predictable value. It is of great importance to excavate more useful early-warning rules from the existent data. It can greatly improve the forward-looking ability and accuracy of the early-warning mechanism.

In the actual system of higher education, a great deal of previous student learning records has been accumulated as time goes on. These data often contain a lot of meaningful rules which can guide early-warning. If these rules can be excavated, then the work of early-warning will become more targeted and effective. This paper presents a method to mine potential meaningful early-warning rules based on association mining. This method has been proved to be effective during practice.

2. Association rules and Apriori algorithm  2.1. Basic model of association rules   The model of association rules was first proposed by R.Agrawal of IBM's Almaden Research Center in 1993[3].

This model is used to find the frequent itemsets and pertinence between itemsets and objectsets in relational database, so as to reflect the interdependence and relativity between transactions. If there are associations between two things, then one of them can be predicted by the other. This model is described as follows in formal language[3]:  Definition 1. I={i1,i2,??,im} as the collection of all items, D for Transaction Database. Transaction T is a subset of items( IT ? ). Each transaction has a unique identifier as Tid.

2008 International Symposium on Knowledge Acquisition and Modeling  DOI 10.1109/KAM.2008.98     Definition 2. Define A as an itemset which consists of items. It is called k-itemset when A has a number of k items. The percentage of number of A occurring in database D called the support of the itemset, recorded as support(A). If the support of an itemset exceeds the minimum threshold value of support which is given by user, this itemset is called frequent itemset, otherwise as non-frequent itemset.

Definition 3. Description form of association rule is a logic-contained formula such as YX ? . If transaction database D has s% transactions including YX ? , then define the support of association rule YX ?  as s%.

Definition 4. Confidence is used to describe the trustworthiness of the rules. It is defined as support( YX ? )/support(X). That is the probability of X and Y appearing at the same time in D, recorded as confidence( YX ? ).

Association rules are the rules whose support and confidence meet the minimum threshold value given by user.

2.2. Apriori algorithm   Apriori algorithm is the most commonly used method  in the mining of association rules. Apriori algorithm includes two steps to mine association rules: the first step is to retrieval all the frequent itemsets whose support values are not lower than the minimum threshold in the transaction database. The second step is to construct the rules which can meet the minimum confidence value using the frequent itemsets[4].

The pseudocode to find frequent itemsets is as follows: Input: transaction database D, minimum support  minsup.

Output: all the frequent itemsets.

L1={frequent 1-itemsets}; for(k=2;Lk-1?? ;k++) do begin Ck=apriori_gen(Lk-1);// Do a natural join operation on  Ck-1 and Ck-1 to generate a superset of Ck as a potential frequent itemset  for all transactions t?D do begin Ct=subset(Ck,t);//t cantains the potential frequent  itemsets for all candidates c?Ct do  c.count++; end; Lk= {c?Ck|c.count?minsup};  end; return kk L? ; The pseudocode to generate association rules are as  follows: Input: all the frequent itemsets, minimum confidence  minconf.

Output: the association rules.

for all frequent k-itemset lk,k?2 do begin  H1={aftermentioned part of the rules in lk}; call ap_genrules(lk,H1);  end; procedure ap_genrules(lk:frequent k-itemset, Hm: set of  aftermentioned part of m items); if(k>m+1) then begin  Hm+1=apriori_gen(Hm); for all hm+1?Hm+1 do begin conf=support(lk)/support(lk-hm+1); if(conf?minconf) then output rule: 11)( ++ ?? mmk hhl //output the rule with confidence=conf and support=support(lk);//output  the support and confidence of the rule else delete hm+1 from Hm+1; end;  call ap_genrules(lk,Hm+1); // iteration end;   3. The basic process and mechanism of school record warning  3.1. The basic process of school record warning   Figure 1 shows the basic process of school record  early-warning. The input information of this process is: the school record of previous students, the school record needed to be monitored, mining references and the restrict terms of the rules. Output information is warning information and tips to the one whose monitored school record is meeting the rules.

The basic warning process is as follows: the first step is to filter the school record of the pervious students, such as classify the records by major and select the majors which are concerned. The second step is to do pretreatment on the selected records, including check the integrity and consistency of the records, eliminate noisy information, filter redundant data which are foreign to the mining and fill the incomplete data according to the statistic rules. The third step is to transform the data into a formal format.

Projection is the most commonly used operation in order to reduce the amount of data needed to be deal with. At this time preparation work of data is basically completed.

Apriori algorithm is used to mine the potential association rules according to the mining references given by administrator. But through this method we will get a large number of association rules including many redundant, irrelevant, or even wrong rules. Further more, the specific area of school record sets some special constraints on association rules, so these rules need to be evaluated and explained in order to select the effective early-warning rules and store them to the rule database. The school record which needs to be monitored will be checked to see whether they are matching the rule one by one in the rule database after pretreatment and transform. Once they are     matched, warning information will be sent to the corresponding student.

Figure 1 Basic process of school record early-warning    3.2. Mining of warning rules   Apriori algorithm is used in the mining of warning rules. Through iteration and pruning the potential link between itemsets will be excavated.

The following example shows how to excavate warning rules on the school records of 33 students in four courses in certain major.

In the original data, the school records of learners are spreading in different fractional ranges. But the early- warning mechanism is more concerned about the students whose academic performances are not satisfactory, that is those who have a gap with the basic requirements.

Therefore, we take a binaryzation operation on the school record data. That means the scores which below 60 points are recorded as 'T'. Otherwise higher than 60 points are recorded as 'F'. So the school records of learners can be transformed into a boolean transaction database shown in Firgure 2. 'Sname' represents the name of the students as 'C1'-'C4' represent four courses.

Figure 2 School record transaction database(a partial  chart)   Apriori algorithm is used to scan the transaction database to find the frequent itemsets. The frequent  itemsets mining in the database are shown in table 1 when support value is 15%.

Table 1 Frequent itemsets itemset support/num  1-itemset  C1 21.21%/7 C2 21.21%/7 C3 27.27%/9 C4 27.27%/9  2-itemset C1 C2 12.12%/4 C1 C4 12.12%/4 C2 C4 15.15%/5  3-itemset C1 C2 C4 12.12%/4   Enumeration algorithm is used to find strong association rules from the frequent itemsets. The strong association rules are shown in table 2 when the confidence value is 50%.
