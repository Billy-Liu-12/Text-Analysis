Extracting Association Rules Based on Intuitionistic Fuzzy Special Sets

Abstract? Intuitionistic fuzzy special sets is a special case of intuitionistic fuzzy sets. In this paper, under the framework of information systems, based on the intuitionistic fuzzy special sets representation of rough sets, Hamming distance of asso- ciation rule between condition and conclusion is discussed. By Hamming distance and the confidence of association rule, opti- mization model for extracting association rule are provided. The advantage of the optimization model is that it could be used to dynamically extract association rule from information systems and distinguish association rules with the same confidence by Hamming distance. Example shows that this paper?s method is an alternative method for extracting association rule.



I. INTRODUCTION  THE aim of knowledge discovery in databases (KDD)is to support human analysts in the overall process of discovering valid, implicit, potentially useful and ultimately understandable information in databases. One of the core tasks of KDD is the mining of association rules (conditional implications). Association rules was stated by [1], so called association rules are statements and provide associations among attributes of information systems, generally, a real number from the interval [0, 1] is assigned to each association rule and provides measure of the confidence of the rule, e.g., ?the customers buying cereals and sugar also buy milk, the confidence the rule are 0.7.? The task of mining association rules is to determine all rules whose confidences and supports are above user defined thresholds. Nowadays, various approaches have been proposed for an increased efficiency of rule discovery in very large databases [2]-[4].

In all of these mining methods, rough set is an important tool to extract association rules from information systems [5]-[10]. Formally, an information system is expressed as a quaternion denoted as ? = (U,A, V, f), where U is a non- empty set of objects, A is a non-empty finite set of attributes, V =  ? a?A Va and Va is the domain of a, f : U ?A ? V is  information function. In ?, ?a ? A and xi, xj ? U , define xi ?a xj if and only if f(x1, a) = f(x2, a), then ?a is an equivalence relation on U , and ?A is intersection of all ?a (a ? A), denotes U/ ?A= {Ur|r = 1, ? ? ? , n}, where Ur is an equivalence class. For rough set, association rules are considered as follows: Let ? be an information system and T = D1 ? D2 ? ? ? ? ? Dk be a template, in which, ?k? ? {1, ? ? ? , k}, Dk? ? (ak? = vik?ak? ), ak? ? A be an attribute, vik?ak? ? Vak? value of the attribute.

rules generated by T could be expressed by the form  ? ? ?  Dl?P  Dl ?? ?  Dj?Q  Dj , (1)  in which, {P,Q} is a partition of {D1, D2, ? ? ? , Dk}. The confidence of association rule ? is defined by  Con?(?) = Sup?(T )  Sup?( ?  Dl?P Dl)  , (2)  in which, Sup?(?) means the number of objects satisfying ?.

One problem in mining association rules is the large number of rules which are usually returned. Two basic steps used in generating process are a fixed threshold c for the confidence of association rule and c?irreducible [10].

The organization of this paper is as follows: In the next Section, Intuitionistic fuzzy special sets Representation of Rough Set are showed. In the Section III, Hamming distance of association rule between condition and conclusion is pro- posed. In the Section IV, optimization model for extracting association rule are provided. Example is in the Section V.



II. IFSS REPRESENTATION OF ROUGH SET  Intuitionistic fuzzy special subset (IFSS) is A = {X,A1, A2}, in which, X 	= ?, A1 ? X , A2 ? X and A1 ? A2 = ? [11]. In [12] and [13], IFSS Representation of Rough Set are discussed based on information systems.

Based on U/ ?A, ?X ? U , define  X = ?  {Uk ? U/ ?A |Uk ? X}, (3) X =  ? {Uk ? U/ ?A |Uk ? X 	= ?}, (4)  when X 	= X , (X, X) is ?A rough set. In (3), due to X ? X , X ? (U ? X) = ? is obviously. Hence, ?U,X,U ? X? is IFSS based on ?A, this means that in the framework of U/ ?A, ?X ? U , there is the follows one to one mapping  (X, X) ?? ?U,X,U ? X?. (5) Definition 1: [13] Let ? be an information system, ?X ?  U , ?U,X,U ? X? is called IFSS representation of (X, X).

As a special case, (U i, U i) ?? ?U,U i?, (U i?)c? = ?U,U i?,  ? j ?=i U  j ? ?.

Definition 2: [13] Let ? be an information system, U/ ?A= {Uk|k = 1, ? ? ? , n}. If ?U,Uk1 , Uk2? such that Uk1 , Uk2 ? U/ ?A and k1 	= k2, then ?U,Uk1 , Uk2? is called basic IFSS based on ?A. Denote B?A = {?U,Uk1 , Uk2?|Uk1 , Uk2 ? U/ ?A, k1 	= k2}.

In the Definition, for a fixed ?, if |U/ ?A | = n, then |B?A | = n(n?1). Let a class of recursive set ?(B?A) such that  1) ??U,Uk1 , Uk2? ? B?A , ?U,Uk1 , Uk2? ? ?(B?A); 2) If ?U,A1, B1?, ?U,A2, B2? ? ?(B?A), then  ?U,A1, B1? ? ?U,A2, B2? = ?U,A1 ?A2, B1 ?B2? ? ?(B?A).

3) If ?U,A1, B1? ? ?(B?A), then ?U,A1, B1? = ?U,B1, A1? ? ?(B?A).

Property 1: [13] ??U,A1, B1? ? ?(B?A), A1 ? B1 = ?, i.e., ?U,A1, B1? is IFSS.

Theorem 1: [13] ?(B?A) is an intuitionistic fuzzy special ?-algebra generated by B?A .

Property 2: [13] In ?(B?A), 1) ?U, ?, ?? ? ?(B?A); 2) ?U i ? U/ ?A, ?U,U i, (U i)c? ? ?(B?A); 3) ?X ? U , ?U, ?, X?, ?U, ?, X? ? ?(B?A); 4) ?X ? U , ?U,X,U ? X? ? ?(B?A).

In Property 2, the final item (4.) means that rough set could be represented by IFSS in ?(B?A). From IFSS point of view, its? advantages in ?(B?A) are that (1) the background knowledge of U/ ?A is used, this could be seen from basic IFSS based on ?A; (2) IFSS is a special case of intuitionistic fuzzy subset (IFS), there are many papers discuss about uncertainty measures of IFS [12]-[19], all of these could be used by IFSS; (3) In [20], implication in IFS is discussed, this means that uncertainty reasoning of IFSS based on logic systems could be finished. In the follows, uncertainty measures of IFS are used to extract association rules in information systems.



III. UNCERTAINTY MEASURES OF IFSS  According to information systems ? and a template T = D1 ? D2 ? ? ? ? ? Dk, equivalence relations ?T , ?P and ?Q on U , which are decided by attribute sets {ak? |(ak? = vik?ak? ) ? T}, {ak? |(ak? = vik?ak? ) ? P} and {ak? |(ak? = vik?ak? ) ? Q} ({P,Q} is a partition of T ), respectively, could be obtained, let  U/ ?T = {U1T , ? ? ? , UmT }, (6) U/ ?P = {U1P , ? ? ? , UnP }, (7) U/ ?Q = {U1Q, ? ? ? , UpQ}. (8)  Due to P ? T and Q ? T , from equivalence classes point of view, U/ ?T is thinner than U/ ?P and U/ ?Q.

For every Um  ?  P ? U/ ?P and Un ?  Q ? U/ ?Q, based on U/ ?T , their rough set, i.e., (Um?P , Um?P ) and (Un  ?  Q , U n?  Q ), could be obtained, respectively. By (5), IFSS representations of (Um  ?  P , U m?  P ) and (U n?  Q , U n?  Q ), i.e., ?U,Um ?  P , U ?Um?P ? and ?U,Un?Q , U ?Un?Q ?, could be obtained, respectively. Based on U/ ?T , (6) and (7) could be rewritten as follows  U/ ?P = {?U,U1P , U ? U1P ?, ? ? ? , ?U,UmP , U ? UmP ?}, (9)  U/ ?Q = {?U,U1Q, U ? U1Q?, ? ? ? , ?U,UnQ, U ? UnQ?}. (10)  When we consider association rule (1) together with (9) and (10), we find the follows potential relationship among (1), (9) and (10):  (I) From logic system point of view, (1) is a logic propo- sition, under the same background U/ ?T , the logic propo- sition expresses a relationship between condition knowledge?  Dl?P Dl and conclusion knowledge  ? Dj?Q  Dj , the rela- tionship could be understood by measures of  ? Dl?P  Dl and? Dj?Q  Dj in some cases.

(II) From information system ? point of view, (1) means  that there exist objects such that they have attributes of P and D, the more objects, the higher the confidence of (1). If all objects, which have attributes of P , are asserted to own attributes Q, then the confidence of the association rule (1) is 1 according to (2).

(III) Due to ? Dl?P  Dl = ?  Dl?P  (al = vilal),  ? Dj?Q  Dj = ?  Dj?Q  (aj = vijaj ),  ? Dl?P  Dl and ?  Dj?Q Dj could decided an equivalent class  in U/ ?P and U/ ?Q, assume as U lP and U jQ, respectively.

Based on U/ ?T , U lP and U jQ correspond to ?U,U lP , U?U lP ? and ?U,U jQ, U ?U jQ?, respectively. Accordingly, association rule (1) could be rewrote by IFSS as follows  ?U,U lP , U ? U lP ? ?? ?U,U jQ, U ? U jQ?. (11) According to (I), implication ? ?? ? in (11) could be understood by measures of IFSS.

For ?U,U lP , U ? U lP ? and ?U,U jQ, U ? U jQ? of (11), their Hamming distance dH  U l P  U j Q  could be calculated as follows  [15]  dH U l  P U  j Q  =  2|U | |U |? s=1  (|U lP (xs) ? U jQ(xs)| +  |(U ? U lP )(xs) ? (U ? U jQ)(xs)| + |?U l  P (xs) ? ?Uj  Q (xs)|), (12)  in which, ?U l P (xs) = 1?U lP (xs)?(U?U lP )(xs), ?Uj  Q (xs) =  1?U jQ(xs)? (U ?U jQ)(xs), U?? and (U ?U?? ) are charac- teristic functions, i.e.,  U?? (x) =  { 1, if x ? U?? , 0, if x /? U?? . (13)  (U ? U?? )(x) = {  1, if x ? U ? U?? , 0, if x /? U ? U?? .

(14)  Firstly, (12) represents two parts knowledge: One is |U lP (xs) ? U jQ(xs)| and |(U ? U lP )(xs) ? (U ? U jQ)(xs)|, they are called certainty knowledge; the other is |?U l  P (xs)?  ? U  j Q (xs)|, it is called uncertainty knowledge. According to     characteristic functions (13) and (14), when xs ? U lP and xs ? U jQ, then |U lP (xs)?U jQ(xs)| = 0. From the knowledge representation point of view, under the background knowl- edge U/ ?T , the smaller dHU l  P U  j Q  , the closer ?U,U lP , U?U lP ? and ?U,U jQ, U ? U jQ?.



IV. EXTRACTING ASSOCIATION RULES BASED ON dH U l  P U  j Q  AND Con?(?)  It could be noticed that dH U l  P U  j Q  depicts consistency of  knowledge representation between U lP and U j Q, i.e., objects  such that ?U,U lP , U ? U lP ? and ?U,U jQ, U ? U jQ?. However, the confidence of (11) is not depicted by dH  U l P  U j Q  . According  to (2) and (13), the confidence of (11) could be rewrote as follows  Con?(?) =  ?|U | s=1 min{U lP (xs), U jQ(xs)}?|U |  s=1 U l P (xs)  . (15)  Based on dH U l  P U  j Q  and Con?(?), optimization models for  extracting association rule ? could be obtained as follows: Let ? be an information system and and T = D1 ? D2 ? ? ? ??Dk be a template, in which, ?k? ? {1, ? ? ? , k}, ak? ? A, vik?ak? ? Vak? and Dk? ? (ak? = vik?ak? ). A partition {P,Q} of {D1, D2, ? ? ? , Dk} is used to obtain association rule  ? ? ?  Dl?P  Dl ?? ?  Dj?Q  Dj  if it is such that  Max w1(1 ? dHU l P ?  U j  Q?  ) + w2Con?(?) ? ?  s.t.

?? ?  a partition{P ?, Q?}of{D1, ? ? ? , Dk}, w1 + w2 = 1, w1, w2 ? [0, 1], ? ? (0, 1].

(16)  In which, w1 and w2 are weights, ? is a fixed threshold decided by users. dH  U l P ?  U j  Q?  and Con?(?) are decided by (12)  and (15) for information system ?, respectively.



V. EXAMPLE  Consider the follows information system with 18 objects and 9 attributes (see Table I)) which is discussed in [10].

Let the template  T = (a1 = 0) ? (a3 = 2) ? (a4 = 1) ? (a6 = 0) ? (a8 = 1).

Firstly, according to Table I and (6),  U/ ?T = {{x1}, {x2, x3, x4, x8, x9, x10, x13, x15, x16, x17}, {x5}, {x6}, {x7}, {x11}, {x12}, {x14}, {x18}}.

Secondly, consider |P | = 1, e.g., (a1 = 0) ?? (a3 = 2) ? (a4 = 1)?(a6 = 0)?(a8 = 1). Let Ua1=0 be equivalent class decided by a1 = 0, and Ua1=0 decided by (a3 = 2)? (a4 =  TABLE I  INFORMATION SYSTEM ?  ? a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 a6 a7 a8 a9  x1 0 1 1 1 80 2 2 2 3  x2 0 1 2 1 81 0 aa 1 aa  x3 0 2 2 1 82 0 aa 1 aa  x4 0 1 2 1 80 0 aa 1 aa  x5 1 1 2 2 81 1 aa 1 aa  x6 0 2 1 2 81 1 aa 1 aa  x7 1 2 1 2 83 1 aa 1 aa  x8 0 2 2 1 81 0 aa 1 aa  x9 0 1 2 1 82 0 aa 1 aa  x10 0 3 2 1 84 0 aa 1 aa  x11 0 1 3 1 80 0 aa 2 aa  x12 0 2 2 2 82 0 aa 2 aa  x13 0 2 2 1 81 0 aa 1 aa  x14 0 3 2 2 81 2 aa 2 aa  x15 0 4 2 1 82 0 aa 1 aa  x16 0 3 2 1 83 0 aa 1 aa  x17 0 1 2 1 84 0 aa 1 aa  x18 1 2 2 1 82 0 aa 2 aa  1) ? (a6 = 0) ? (a8 = 1). The follows equivalent classes could be obtain in Table I,  Ua1=0 = {x1, x2, x3, x4, x6, x8, x9, x10, x11, x12, x13, x14, x15, x16, x17},  Ua1=0 = {x2, x3, x4, x8, x9, x10, x13, x15, x16, x17}, Ua3=2 = {x2, x3, x4, x8, x9, x10, x12, x13, x14, x15, x16,  x17, x18}, Ua3=2 = {x2, x3, x4, x8, x9, x10, x13, x15, x16, x17}, Ua4=1 = {x1, x2, x3, x4, x8, x9, x10, x11, x13, x14, x15,  x16, x17, x18}, Ua4=1 = {x2, x3, x4, x8, x9, x10, x15, x16, x17, x18}, Ua6=0 = {x2, x3, x4, x8, x9, x10, x11, x12, x13, x15, x16,  x17, x18}, Ua6=0 = {x2, x3, x4, x8, x9, x10, x13, x15, x16, x17}, Ua8=1 = {x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7, x8, x9, x10, x13, x15,  x16, x17}, Ua8=1 = {x2, x3, x4, x8, x9, x10, x13, x15, x16, x17}.

Correspond to IFSS representation of them as follows  ?U,Ua1=0, U ? Ua1=0? = ?U,Ua1=0, {x5, x7, x18}?, ?U,Ua1=0, U ? Ua1=0? = ?U,Ua1=0, {x1, x5, x6, x7,  x11, x12, x14, x18}?, ?U,Ua3=2, U ? Ua3=2? = ?U,Ua3=2, {x1, x6, x7, x11}?, ?U,Ua3=2, U ? Ua3=2? = ?U,Ua3=2, {x1, x5, x6, x7,  x11, x12, x14, x18}?, ?U,Ua4=1, U ? Ua4=1? = ?U,Ua4=1, {x5, x6, x7, x12,  x14}?, ?U,Ua4=1, U ? Ua4=1? = ?U,Ua4=1, {x1, x5, x6, x7,  x11, x12, x14, x18}?,     ?U,Ua6=0, U ? Ua6=0? = ?U,Ua6=0, {x1, x5, x6, x7, x14}?,  ?U,Ua6=0, U ? Ua6=0? = ?U,Ua6=0, {x1, x5, x6, x7, x11, x12, x14, x18}?,  ?U,Ua8=1, U ? Ua8=1? = ?U,Ua8=1, {x1, x11, x12, x14, x18}?,  ?U,Ua8=1, U ? Ua8=1? = ?U,Ua8=1, {x1, x5, x6, x7, x11, x12, x14, x18}?.

According to (12) and (15), the follows could be obtained  dH Ua1=0Ua1=0  =  , Con?(?) =   ;  dH Ua3=2Ua3=2  =  , Con?(?) =   ;  dH Ua4=1Ua4=1  =  , Con?(?) =   ;  dH Ua6=0Ua6=0  =  , Con?(?) =   ;  dH Ua8=1Ua8=1  =  , Con?(?) =   .

In (16), select w1 = w2 = 12 , and Max association rules with weight 0.80 are  (a6 = 0) ?? (a1 = 0) ? (a3 = 2) ? (a4 = 1) ? (a8 = 1).

(a8 = 1) ?? (a1 = 0) ? (a3 = 2) ? (a4 = 1) ? (a6 = 0).

Similarly, consider |P | = 2, e.g., (a1 = 0) ? (a3 = 2) ?? (a4 = 1) ? (a6 = 0) ? (a8 = 1). The follows equivalent classes could be obtain in Table I,  U (a1=0?a3=2) = {x2, x3, x4, x8, x9, x10, x13, x14, x15, x16, x17},  U (a1=0?a4=1) = {x1, x2, x3, x4, x8, x9, x10, x11, x13, x15, x16, x17},  U (a1=0?a6=0) = {x2, x3, x4, x8, x9, x10, x11, x12, x13, x15, x16, x17},  U (a1=0?a8=1) = {x2, x3, x4, x6, x8, x9, x10, x13, x15, x16, x17},  U (a3=2?a4=1) = {x2, x3, x4, x8, x9, x10, x13, x15, x16, x17, x18},  U (a3=2?a6=0) = {x2, x3, x4, x8, x9, x10, x13, x15, x16, x17, x18},  U (a3=2?a8=1) = {x2, x3, x4, x5, x8, x9, x10, x13, x15, x16, x17},  U (a4=1?a6=0) = {x2, x3, x4, x8, x9, x10, x11, x13, x15, x16, x17, x18},  U (a4=1?a8=1) = {x2, x3, x4, x8, x9, x10, x13, x15, x16, x17},  U (a6=0?a8=1) = {x2, x3, x4, x8, x9, x10, x13, x15, x16, x17},  U (a1=0?a3=2) = {x2, x3, x4, x8, x9, x10, x13, x15, x16, x17},  U (a1=0?a4=1) = {x2, x3, x4, x8, x9, x10, x13, x15, x16, x17},  U (a1=0?a6=0) = {x2, x3, x4, x8, x9, x10, x13, x15, x16, x17},  U (a1=0?a8=1) = {x2, x3, x4, x8, x9, x10, x13, x15, x16, x17, x18},  U (a3=2?a4=1) = {x2, x3, x4, x8, x9, x10, x13, x15, x16, x17},  U (a3=2?a6=0) = {x2, x3, x4, x8, x9, x10, x13, x15, x16, x17},  U (a3=2?a8=1) = {x2, x3, x4, x8, x9, x10, , x11, x13, x15, x16, x17},  U (a4=1?a6=0) = {x2, x3, x4, x8, x9, x10, , x13, x15, x16, x17},  U (a4=1?a8=1) = {x2, x3, x4, x8, x9, x10, , x13, x15, x16, x17},  U (a6=0?a8=1) = {x2, x3, x4, x8, x9, x10, , x13, x15, x16, x17}.

Correspond to IFSS representation of them as follows  ?U,U (a1=0?a3=2), U ? U (a1=0?a3=2)? = ?U,U (a1=0?a3=2), {x1, x5, x6, x7, x11, x12, x18}?  ?U,U (a1=0?a4=1), U ?

According to (12) and (15), the follows could be obtained  dH U(a1=0?a3=2)U(a1=0?a3=2)  =  , Con?(?) =   ;  dH U(a1=0?a4=1)U(a1=0?a4=1)  =  , Con?(?) =   ;  dH U(a1=0?a6=0)U(a1=0?a6=0)  =  , Con?(?) =   ;  dH U(a1=0?a8=1)U(a1=0?a8=1)  =  , Con?(?) =   ;  dH U(a3=2?a4=1)U(a3=2?a4=1)  =  , Con?(?) =   .

dH U(a3=2?a6=0)U(a3=2?a6=0)  =  , Con?(?) =   ;  dH U(a3=2?a8=1)U(a3=2?a8=1)  =  , Con?(?) =   ;  dH U(a4=1?a6=0)U(a4=1?a6=0)  =  , Con?(?) =   ;  dH U(a4=1?a8=1)U(a4=1?a8=1)  = 0, Con?(?) = 1;  dH U(a6=0?a8=1)U(a6=0?a8=1)  = 0, Con?(?) = 1.

Select w1 = w2 = 12 , and Max association rules with weight  1 are  (a4 = 1 ? a8 = 1) ?? (a1 = 0) ? (a3 = 2) ? (a6 = 0).

(a6 = 0 ? a8 = 1) ?? (a1 = 0) ? (a3 = 2) ? (a4 = 1).

For |P | = 3 and |P | = 4, they are symmetric with |P | = 2 and |P | = 1, respectively, it is easy to obtain the follows association rules with weight 1  (a1 = 0) ? (a3 = 2) ? (a6 = 0) ?? (a4 = 1 ? a8 = 1).

(a1 = 0) ? (a3 = 2) ? (a4 = 1) ?? (a6 = 0 ? a8 = 1).

Compared with the conclusion of [10] (there are six as- sociation rules in [10]), by fixing threshold ?, all needed association rules could be obtained. On the other hand, this paper provides distance to distinguish association rules with the same confidence.



VI. CONCLUSIONS  In information systems, extracting association rules is an important subject. In this paper, based on the intuitionistic fuzzy special sets representation of rough sets, Hamming distance of association rule between condition and conclusion is discussed, optimization model for extracting association rule are provided, the optimization model combines Ham- ming distance and the confidence of association rule. By fixing threshold ?, the optimization model could be used to dynamically extract association rule from information systems and distinguish association rules with the same confidence by Hamming distance.
