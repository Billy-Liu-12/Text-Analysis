Urban Residential Power Load Risk Identification Based on Data Mining

Abstract?Following the fast urban economic development and the improvement of people living standard, urban residential electricity consumption is increasing quickly. Although the influencing factors of urban residential power demand are complex, objective analysis of risk factors of urban residential load will offer a scientific decision base for the urban power planning and Power Demand-side management. In this paper, related factors with resident living power utility of nine typical cites is chosen based on data mining technology, and association rule mining is finished based on R program language. Then, frequent itemsets of dataset associated with resident living power utility is excavated based on backward algorithm programming. Finally, risk factors of urban residential load can be concluded according to frequent itemsets. This method can avoid subjectivity of determining the risk factors of urban residential load, and also can provide a decision foundation for scientific forecasting of urban residential electricity consumption.

I. INTRODUCTION With the development of national economy, the  proportion of residential power consumption to the total power consumption of cities in China keeps on rising, so how to forecast the level of residential load accurately is concerned greatly by researchers.

The developing trend of residential power consumption demand was impacted by lots of risk factors, such as household appliance, residents? income, substitute energy (gas, coal), new energy (solar power, bio-energy), etc.

According to the home and abroad literature, the effect factors considered are mainly alternative energy of electricity [1], the innovation of appliances production [2], the change of average temperature of residents living per month [3], holidays effects [4]-[5] and the weather conditions[6]-[8] and so on.  But all above literatures was considered one or several risk factors which influencing load in the residential load forecasting, which chosen risk factors is subjective based on the current condition of resident living power utility, but without systematic and scientific analysis.

Moreover the association statistics data of residential load is  insufficient. Difference of the residential load characteristics exist in different time and different regions. So these risk factors affecting the residential loads need to be analyzed systematically and scientifically.

Data Mining(DM), also called knowledge discovery, which collect the achievements of machine learning, pattern recognition, database, significant, artificial intelligence and management information system and so on. Date mining technology can be used to analyze and excavate the influencing factors of urban residential load, which will provide basic to determine scientifically the risk factors of urban residential loads.

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 analyzes the possible influencing factors about urban residential loads. Section 3 introduces the basic theory on Data Mining.

Section 4 excavates risk factors of urban residential loads based on Data Mining. Section 5 concludes with some rational suggestions on risk analysis about urban residential loads, electric power demand forecasting in cities and risk management on urban power system planning.



II. INFLUENCING FACTORS OF URBAN RESIDENTIAL POWER LOAD  Urban residential electricity load is produced by using all kinds of household appliances, so the electricity consumption depends on the electrical equipment, type, and quantity and usage frequency. The type and number of household appliances is relative to income level, housing conditions, urbanization rate, population, climate, life style, etc. In addition, electricity  for urban residential use  is affected by the  measures of demand side management, regulation on electricity price, distribution network reconstruction, power promotion, energy market competition, national energy saving policy, etc.

The data of urban residential loads are enormous and complicated, but they include many useful information.

With the application of Data Mining, we can discovery potential, useful and valuable information from large database to risk identification of urban residential loads.



III. BASIC THEORY OF DATA MINING  A. Data Mining   DOI 10.1109/FSKD.2009.23    DOI 10.1109/FSKD.2009.23           Data Mining is named as knowledge discovery in the database. It is a process of finding out the previously unknown rules and relations from lots of data though selection, exploring and modeling, which aims at obtaining the clear and useful results for the data owner. R.Agrawal, etc has put forward Association Rules Mining in the 1990s.

Association Rules Mining is to find out the interested relating information between item sets in the amount of data.

Going though the development of decades, association rules mining has became a ripe and very important method of DM techniques [9].

Data mining process include: knowledge preparation and requirement analysis, data selection and extraction, data cleaning and pretreatment, data conversion, Data Mining, result evaluation and explanation, knowledge presenting.

B. Association Rules Mining 1) Basic concept: Itemset, which is set of items, is a  basic concept of association rules mining. Supposing itemset I={I1,I2,?,In}, where Ii(i=1,2,?n) is related influencing factors of urban resident load; K-itemset (k=1,2,3,?,n) means an itemset including k items, denoted as Tk, where k is item number. Transaction is a set of items.

Supposing transaction T, thenT I? . If there are itemsets X and Y, X I? , Y I? , X Y? = ? , then expression like X Y?  is called association rule, where X is antecedent, Y  is consequent. Association rule reflects  the rules that items of Y appear following those of X.

Support degree of the rule X Y?  in the dataset D will measure the importance of association rules, reflect the rule?s representative by judging whether association is commonly existed. That?s to say, the probability that X and Y happened in the whole transactions at the same time is shown as: support ( X Y? ). If the probability of an itemset presenting is not smaller than the minimum support degree threshold, then it is called as frequent itemsets. Set of frequent K-itemset is often denoted as LK .

Confidence of the rule X Y?  in the transaction dataset D will measure the accuracy of association rules, measuring the intensity of association rules. It indicates that the probability of Y presenting in transactions where X has appeared, expressed as confidence ( X Y? ).

The association rule that satisfies minimum support degree threshold and minimum confidence threshold simultaneously is called strong association rule. Given a transaction dataset D, the problem of mining association rules is to produce the strong association rules, which support degree and confidence is respectively larger than the minimum support degree and the minimum confidence user appointed  Rule of high confidence sometimes has certain fraudulence. It only gives estimation of conditional probability when X and Y are given, not the actual intensity implicated between X and Y. One of ways to solving the problem is to use lift degree as measure standards, as shown  in formula (1).

( ) ( )P Y X P YLift =                (1)  It indicates the influence of X appearing on Y presenting, is the ratio of confidence and expected confidence of Y, denoted as P(Y). The research on mining algorithm is based on three measure standards in Table 1 as below.

TABLE1. STATISTICAL DESCRIPTION OF ASSOCIATION RULES  Name Description Calculation formula  Support  Support degree of the rule X Y? in the dataset D will measure the importance of association rules, reflect the rule?s representative by judging whether association is commonly existed. That is to say, the probability that X and Y happened in the whole transactions at the same time is shown as: support  ( X Y? ).

P(XY)  Confidence  Confidence of the rule X Y?  in the transaction dataset D will measure the accuracy of association rules, measuring the intensity of association rules. It indicates the probability of Y presenting in transactions where X has appeared, and necessity of  rule X Y? , expressed as confidence ( X Y? ).

P(Y|X)  Lift  Lift of the rule X Y?  in the transaction dataset D will measure the accuracy degree of prediction. It is a comparison of two probabilities: one probability is buying Y on condition that X is bought; the other is buying Y in any circumstances. It is shown as  lift ( X Y? ).

P(Y|X)/ P(Y)   2?Association rules mining algorithm:Apriori algorithm is a classic algorithm of association rules mining, whose core ideology is dividing the work of finding out the association rules into two steps. First, all frequent item sets are found out in the transaction database though iteration. Second, the rules satisfying the user?s minimum trust from frequent item sets are set up. The core of Apriori algorithm is mining or discovering all frequent item sets, which accounts for most parts of the calculation. Recurrence method was used to create all the frequent sets. Apriori algorithm was described simply as follows [10]:  (1) L1={the first frequent item set}; (2) For(k=2; 1kL ? ? ? ; k++) do begin (3) Ck=apriori-gen(Lk-1); // the new candidate item set (4) For transaction set t D?  do begin (5) Ct=subset(Ck, t); //the candidate sets in the transaction  set (6) For every candidate set tc C?  do (7) c.count++;           (8) End (9) Lk={ kc C? |c.count?supportmin } (10) End  (11)  m Answer LKk  = = ?  Where D is transaction database; t is transaction set; LK  is the kth frequent item sets; CK  is the kth candidate item sets (potential frequent item set); supportmin is the minimum support degree.

The procedure of the algorithm is generating the first frequent item sets 1L , and then generating the second  frequent item sets 2L  and so on. As far as there is a certain r causing the Lr is empty set, the algorithm would end. In the kth iteration, the process generates the candidate k-item sets CK  at first. The each item set in CK is generated by  two frequent sets belonging to 1KL ?  and only contains one different item though a (k-2) connection. The item sets in Ck are candidate sets used to generate frequent item sets.

The last item frequent set LK must be one subset of CK .

Every element in CK must be testified in the trading database to make the decision that whether the element should join in LK .

The key risk factors influencing the increasing residential electricity consumption will be determined through the mining process of the association rules above.



IV. URBAN RESIDENTIAL LOAD RISK IDENTIFICATION BASED ON DATA MINING  The key influencing risk factors of residential load is identified based on the Data Mining association rules mining.

The risk factors of residential using electricity in China were identified by us through the calculating analysis in the typical cities in China in this part. The nine typical cities? residential living power utility in China and the associated data with fifteen factors in the period of 1992 to 2006 are studied by the association rules mining in the research. All the data are from the various areas? statistical yearbook [11-19].

There are many factors affecting urban residential load.

Accounting for the feasibility of the research and the attainability of the data, the factors employed are as follows.

Nomenclature  Symbols DL   urban residential load AWD    the average temperature BG     the number of freezer ownership per one hundred urban  households DBX   the number of refrigerator ownership per one hundred  urban households  DCJ    the number of electrical cooker ownership per one hundred urban households  DN    the number of computer ownership per one hundred urban households  JY     the number of the employees in tertiary industry  KT    the number of air conditioner ownership per one hundred urban households  M     the number of males PERS   housing area per capita PYYJ   the number of exhaust fan ownership per one hundred  urban households  SR      disposable income per capita TRQ the amount of gas consumption for living per capita TV    the number of TV ownership per one hundred urban  households WBL   the number of microwave oven ownership per one  hundred urban households  XCQ   the number of vacuum cleaner ownership per one hundred urban households  XNY   the renewable energy consumption used by the residents (giving priority to solar energy )  XYJ   the number of washing machine ownership per one hundred urban households  ZC    fare for water, electricity and fuel per capita  Acronyms  BJ Beijing FZ Fuzhou SH Shanghai XA Xi?an TJ Tianjin HEB Harbin CQ Chongqing JN Jinan NB Ningbo  A. Data preprocessing Accounting into the feasibility of the research and the  attainability of the data mining, twenty-one series factors of sixteen-year dates was selected from the conventional influencing factors to uncertainty influencing factors in the selection of residential power load influencing factors in the preprocess of the data mining. The typical nine cities selected in this paper embodied the universality. The representative more development municipality cities were selected, such as Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Chongqing, and the typical economic less-development areas as Harbin, Xi?an, Jinan and Fuzhou were selected as the time. In order to make the association data mining to the different taking value intervals, the source data were treated as the data among zero to one according to the formula 2 at first.

min  max min  x-xx = x -x  ?   (2)  Moreover, according to the substitution effect of the new energy mainly solar energy, and that there was a certain difficulty in the collection of the solar energy data of the residential living. But according to the comprehensive calculation of the number of the solar water heater and the area dates of the household installed solar device in the related research recently, the proportion of  the electricity consumption total of the situation of the using solar instead of the power by residential was assumed in each city. In which the proportion is between 0.9-1.5% in Beijing,           Shanghai, Ningbo, the proportion is between 0.5-1.3% in Tianjin, Chongqing, Harbin, and the proportion is between 0.2-1.1% in Xi?an, Fuzhou, Jinan.

B. Association rules mining In the R language, it was implemented by the function of  apriori() in the Apriori algorithm, the C source code of the Apriori algorithm was called, which mined the frequent item sets and association rules.

Use method as follows: ( , ,  , )  apriori data parameter NULL  appearance NULL control NULL  =  = =  TABLE2. THE USAGE OF THE APRIORI() FUNCTION  Parameters Usage  Data  Transaction database or other data structures (as 0-1 matrix data frame and so on) In this paper what we fingers are the data of resident living power utility.

Parameter The setting of a series of parameters. The acquiescent parameter support is 0.1 the confidence is 0.8 the largest item is 5.

appearance The constraint parameter of the rule, the acquiescent value is no adding restraint.

control The parameters of the control mining algorithm (as the scheduling of the item and so on).

At first, a panel data was built up according to the  treated data, which named PDATA.

Input the orders followed into the R program window: >library (?arules?) >residential<-read.csv ("PDATA.csv", header=TRUE) >residential Some basic information of the dataset could be called, it  can be seen that the data was a dataset of 144 ranks and 12 columns from the output. Then transaction dataset was implemented by association rule mining with Apriori algorithm, input the orders as follows:  >rules<-apriori (residential, Parameter =list (support=0.905, confidence =1)) >rules Set of 63 rules The sixty-three rules which the support was up to 0.905  and the confidence was to 1 were mined after the operating of the Apriori algorithm. In fact, it was no valuable if the confidence was low in particular progress. Generally speaking,  the association rules which satisfied both minimum support threshold value and the minimum confidence threshold would be called strong rule?The most interesting and significance among the results of the association rules is strong rules. However, the rules with high confidence and low support value have not great practical significance to the businessmen sometimes. As a result, the confidence above 0.85 should be carried out the trial calculation in the progress of the mining. If the data quality is larger, it is a waste of time to use the Apriori algorithm directly. Then the Apriori algorithm based on sampling technique was carried out, or the analysis could be carried out that the mining speed and precision between the  Apriori algorithm directly and the Apriori algorithm based on sampling technique. The procedure is that extracts a simple dataset at first, and then excavates the dataset. It was found after the comparison that it was advisable whatever in the speed and the precision in the progress of the mining of mass data using the Apriori algorithm based on sampling technique. The concrete algorithm is followed:  The algorithm of the association rule mining R language:  > library (?arules?) >residential<-read.csv ("PDATA.csv", header=TRUE) > residential > summary (residential) > attach(residential) >as.factor(DL);as.factor(SR);as.factor(PERS); as.factor  (RK); as.factor(XYJ); >as.factor(TV);as.factor(DBX);as.factor(BG);as.factor(  DN);as.factor(WBL);as.factor(KT); > as.factor(DCJ);as.factor(PYYJ);as.factor(XCQ);  as.factor(F);as.factor(M);as.factor(TRQ); >as.factor(JY);as.factor(ZC);as.factor(XNY);as.factor(A  WD); as.factor(HWD) >residential<-cbind(DL,SR,PERS,RK,XYJ,TV,DBX,BG  ,DN,WBL,KT,DCJ,PYYJ,XCQ,M,F, TRQ,JY,ZC,XNY, AWD,HWD)  > residential > summary(residential) >rules<-apriori(residential, parameter=list(support= 0.89,  confidence=1, maxlen=16)) > rules > summary(rules) > x=subset(rules, subset=rhs%in%"DL"&lift>=0.7) > y=inspect (SORT (x, by=?confidence?)) In order to obverse conveniently, because of the existing  of the similarly between the association rules, so the rules similarly were finished into 63 rules.

It was seen from the results of the association rule mining that it was not only effected by the type and amounts of daily using household appliances, but also were associated strongly with residential disposable income per capita, residential using fuel mass per capita, fare for water, electricity and fuel per capita, the number of males and the renewable energy consumption used by the residents (giving priority to solar energy). The frequent items of the association rule mining are followed as table 3:  TABLE3.

It was significant that the changes of 7 factors have greater influence in the progress of the residential living power utility demand. Therefore, the 7 factors are the key risk factors that effect the residential power load, namely: the amount of gas consumption for living per capita, fare for water, electricity and fuel per capita, the number of the employees in tertiary industry, the average temperature and residential disposable income per capita and so on.



V. CONCLUSION With the rapid development of urban economy, urban  residential load increases promptly. The recognition of key risk factors about urban electricity load will providing a basis for decision-making on electricity demand forecasting in city and risk management on urban power system planning.

This paper has determined key risk factors which effect urban residential load based on DM association rules technology. Association Rules Mining found out seven key factors affecting urban residential load in China based on R program language. They are the amount of gas consumption for living per capita, fare for water, electricity and fuel per capita,  the number of the employees in tertiary industry, the average temperature, disposable income per capita, etc.

which provide scientific basis for scientific forecasting urban residential load risk factors. In the future, we should continue to improve database of urban residential load, to excavate risk factors of urban residential load of international cities whose residential load is saturate, and to discovery more association rules and knowledge, finally, to conclude a more perfect risk index system of urban residential load and provide scientific basis for risk management on urban power system planning.
