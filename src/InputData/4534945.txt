Identifying Critical Positions and Rules of   Antigenic Drift for Influenza A/H3N2 Viruses

Abstract?Pathogenic avian and human influenza virus often cause disastrous damage to human society and economics.

Understanding antigenic drift of influenza viruses is an emergent issue for prophylaxis and vaccine development. In this study, we identified antigenic critical amino acid positions on hemagglutinin (HA) gene and rules for predicting antigenic variants. The information gain (IG) is applied to calculate the degree of association between the position mutation and antigenic drift. An amino acid with high IG at a specific position implied that this position is highly correlated to antigenic type change.

The decision tree is applied to build model and discover rules for predicting antigenic variants. The decision tree can identify amino acid mutation rules that lead to the antigenic drift. The predicting accuracy of this model is 91.2% which is better than related models. Most of these selected positions with high IG are located on epitope or surface on the HA structure. The position 145 with highest information gain could lead to antigenic cluster transition were verified. These results demonstrate that our approach is robust and is potential useful for vaccine development.

I. INTRODUCTION Pathogenic avian and human influenza viruses often cause  significant damage to human society and economics [1]. The influenza virus is divided into subtypes based on major differences in the surface proteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase, which are the most important targets for the human immune system. The HA protein consists of two domains, HA1 (329 residues) and HA2 (175 residues) [2].

Most works [3, 4] focused on the HA1 domain, which is the immunogenic part of HA. The epitopes of HA can be divided into five areas labeled as A, B, C, D, and E [2].

In circulating influenza viruses, antigenic drift arises from gradually accumulated mutations on HA. The antigenic drift often implies that vaccines should be updated to correspond with the dominant epidemic strains of HA [1]. Thus mapping the genetic to antigenic evolution of influenza virus is one of great critical issues to public health. Many methods have been proposed to study the antigenic drift and vaccine development.

Retrospective quantitative analyses of the genetic data have revealed important insights into the evolution of influenza viruses [3, 4]. Recently, Smith et al. [5] demonstrated that the  antigenic evolution was more punctuated than the genetic evolution, and the genetic change sometimes causes a  Pairwise sequence alignment to generate  string with 329 binary bits  HI assay (antigenic data)  Classify antigenic type according to antigenic  distance  Calculate the information gain between each amino acid position (Xi)  and antigenic type (Y)  Applying decision tree to discover the pattern of antigenic drift  HA sequences (genetic data)  Figure 1.

In this study, we have proposed a new method to identify antigenic critical positions of HA1 and to discover the rules of antigenic drift. These critical positions and rules were evaluated on a data set. The results are able to reflect the biological meanings and our method achieve high prediction accuracy.



II. MATERIALS AND METHODS  A. Hemagglutination-inhibition assay data The flowchart of this study is shown in Fig. 1. In the  current global influenza surveillance system, the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay is the primary method to characterize the antigenicity of influenza virus. We collected HI-assay data from related work [6]. The dataset contains 181 pairwise comparisons among 45 viruses from 1971 to 2002.

Most of them are the vaccine strains determined by World Health Organization (WHO). The vaccine strains were usually dominant strain of that season. The influenza vaccine is considered to be updated if antigenic distance is more than 4.0 between current vaccine strain and the strains expected to circulate in next season [5]. According to the antigenic distance [7], pairwise comparisons with antigenic distance  4 are classified as antigenic variant cases and other cases were     classified as antigenic equivalent cases. In this data set, 125 cases are antigenic variant and 56 cases are antigenic equivalent cases.

B. HA sequence data The HA1 sequence, 329 amino acids long, of the H3N2  virus was downloaded from Los Alamos Influenza Sequence Database [8] or extracted from the original publications if they were not available in public sequence databases. These sequences are easily aligned without gap. The pairwise comparison between two sequences is represented as a string with 329 bits, a position (bit) i is denoted as 1 if the residues at the position i of two sequences are not identical (mutation), otherwise the position i is denoted as 0. Each of these 181 cases consisted of an antigenic type (i.e. antigenic variant or antigenic equivalent) calculated from the antigenic distance and a 329-bit string derived from the comparison between two HA1 sequences.

We first discuss the genetic diversity, which commonly believed related to immune selection, of each amino acid position on HA1. Here, Shannon entropy was used to calculate the genetic diversity of an amino acid position Xi (i=1~329) with 20 types and is defined as  =  ==?=   ))(log(()()( j  iii jXPjXPXH  C. Identify antigenic critical positions on HA1 In this study, the antigenic effect of one amino acid position  is defined as the degree of association between mutation on this position and the change of antigenic type. The information gain (IG) [9] is used to calculate this degree of association. An amino acid with high IG at a specific position implied that if a mutation on this position is highly correlated to antigenic variants. The IG of the position Xi associates to antigenic type Y is defined as  )|()(),( ii XYHYHYXI ?=  H(Y) evaluates the entropy of the antigenic type Y and is give as  =  ==?= EVj  jj yYPyYPYH ,  ))(log()()(  Two states of yj are the antigenic variant (V) and the antigenic equivalent (E). H(Y| Xi) evaluates the conditional entropy of Y when given a state of position Xi. Two states of position Xi are the mutated state represented as 1 and the non-mutated state represented as 0. H(Y| Xi) is defined as  =  ==?= 0,1  )|()()|( j  jijii xXYHxXPXYH  D. Discover the rule of antigenic drift After identifying antigenic critical positions, we further to  discover the patterns of antigenic drifts. Here, we applied the decision tree [9] for discovering rules and predicting antigenic  variants. An amino acid position with high IG was selected as an internal node in the tree to discriminate two antigenic types. According to the selected positions and constructed tree, we can easily identify the rules from the root to the leaves of the tree. The hierarchy of the tree could help us to identify co- mutations that lead to the antigenic drift. Here, the method is described as follows:  In each tree level, the position with highest IG from current unexplained cases is selected. In this data set, the position 145 with the highest IG is selected as the first node in the tree. The cases which mutate on the position 145 are collected as the set R. In this case, R consists of 62 cases. The amino acid positions are considered as co-mutated positions with the positions 145 if their IG values significantly drop after the set R is removed from the original data set (i.e. 181 cases). For the position 145, the position 126 and 278 are considered co-mutated sites of the position 145. After removing those cases (i.e. the set R) explained by the current node (i.e. the position 145), the method repeats the same process to select next node with highest IG from remaining cases. The process will stop when all cases are explained.

E. Predicting antigenic variants Our model based on decision tree was evaluated on a data  set to predict antigenic variant accuracy and was compared with other methods. Wilson & Cox [10] suggested that a drift viral variant of epidemiologic importance usually contains more than 4 residues changes located on at least 2 of the five epitopes. Lee & Chen  [6] proposed a model based on the 131 positions on five epitopes of HA1 to predict antigenic variants.

The model will predict a pairwise comparison as antigenic variant when there are more then 6 amino acid mutations between two HA1 sequences.

III. RESULTS  A. Identify the antigenic critical positions on HA The positions with top four information gains are listed in  Table I. The IG value and the entropy of each position are normalized from 0 to 1. As shown in Fig. 2, these four positions (145-A, 189-B, 278-C, and 158-B) located in Area I     have both high IG and entropy. For the position 145 located at the epitope A, its IG value is the highest (1.0) and the entropy is the top two (0.87) among all positions. Among 181 cases, the position 145 mutates on 62 cases and 61 of these cases are the antigenic variants. This result implies that a mutation on the position highly induces an antigenic drift and is consistent to observation by Smith et al. [5], that is, the single amino acid substitution N145K can be responsible for antigenic cluster transition. We observed that the other three positions with high IG values and entropies obtained the similar behavior as the position 145.  As shown in Fig. 2, the positions in Area I with both high IG and entropy are considered as critical positions in this work.

Figure 2 shows the relationship between the entropies and the information gains of 329 amino acids of HA1. All 329 positions can be classified into four groups according to these two indexes. Area II shows that the positions with high genetic diversity (high entropy) may infer low antigenic effect. For example, the positions (i.e. 226-D, 135-A and 121-D) have high entropies and low IG values. Among 181 cases, the position 226 mutates on 61 cases and 34 of these cases are the antigenic variant (Table I). A low IG implies that a mutation on this position less preference to be an antigenic variant.  Our method can avoid this advantage of considering only the entropy, which was widely used in previous works.

Figure 3A shows the distribution of IG values of 329 positions on the HA1 structure. The positions with top four IG values (145-A 189-B, 278-C, and 158-B) are red and other positions are near to gray based on the decreasing IG values.

The positions with high IG values are located on the protein surface. Three (145-A 189-B and 158-B) of top four IG positions are located around the receptor binding site which is key for neutralizing influenza virus. Furthermore, the structure of HA trimer (Fig. 3B) shows that high IG positions also prefer to locate on the top head of HA1 and on the interface between HA monomers.

The positions (i.e. 145-A, 278-C, 289-B, and 158-B) with high entropy and high IG value are highly correlated to the antigenic drift. Conversely, the positions (i.e. 226-D, 121-D, and 135-B) with high entropy and low IG value  are lowly correlated to the antigenic drift.

Six amino acid positions are selected as internal nodes in the tree. Based on this tree, we can derive seven rules and the predicted accuracy is 91.2%.  Table II shows the comparison of our method with other two methods on predicting antigenic type on 181 cases. The accuracy of our method is the best among these three methods and the accuracy is 91.2%. The first rule of this tree is: the antigenic type is predicted as the antigenic variant if the position 145 is mutated. Among 181 cases, 62 cases can apply this rule and 61 of them predicted correct. The last rule of this tree is: the antigenic type is predicted as the antigenic equivalent if the positions 145, 189, 62, 155, 213, and 214 are not mutated.

The selected critical positions and co-mutated positions are summarized in Table III. In the first tree level, the position 145 is selected and the co-mutated positions are 126 and 278. These three sites are located on two epitopes A and C. The result is consistent to the observation of Wilson & Cox [10]. They concluded that a drift viral variant of epidemiologic importance usually contains more than 4 residues changes located on at least 2 epitopes. The hierarchical method is able to identify critical amino acids and its co-mutated positions that lead to antigenic drift in different influenza seasons.

IV. CONCLUSION  This study demonstrates the robustness and feasibility of the decision tree for identifying critical amino acid positions of HA1 and discovering combined rules of antigenic drift for influenza H3N2 viruses. Our method achieves 91.2% accuracy and is significantly better than other two methods on the test set. The identified critical amino acid positions are similar to related works and its co-mutated positions are able to reflect the biological meanings. We believe that our method can be adopted in the vaccine development and the HA1 protein sequence evolution.
