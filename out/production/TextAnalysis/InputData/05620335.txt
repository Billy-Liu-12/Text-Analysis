Research on the Application of Information Technology in Enterprise Equipment

Abstract-Many information management projects of state own and large enterprises in China target in equipment management in recent years. There are some information technology points at this course, but those methods and software usually use the basic data and the traditional job processing control management, which can not meet the big professional equipment's demands. For this reason, this paper designs a new equipment management model and system that use the network structure to integrate each main job task and form a system that emphasis on the collection and statistics of device's data information, equipment operating design and control, equipment malfunction detective and relative technology analysis. This system can achieve dynamic management and will be great helpful to professional equipment manager's daily work.

Keywords- information technology; equipment management; database  1. INTRODUCTION  Nowadays, in the equipment management area, the industrial enterprise is increasingly in the transformation process from traditional management that greatly relies on the experience to a new method based on information technology. This paper describes a project that designs and implements a network based information management system and develops an equipment management software in enterprise's production field. The main research questions are seen bellow:  (1) To establish a network of distributed industrial equipments and make them in an integrated system;  (2) To establish a database of the equipments that can collect and store each kind of device's data, and make them easily be observed by equipment profession workers;  (3) To design a practical equipment management job system and related ERP software that contain equipment  manager and workers' daily work schedule such as machine maintain, statistical spare parts, etc.



II. INFORMATION MODEL DESIGN  The process of the information design of the equipment system includes network model design and security level setting.

A. Network Model  Now the traditional Server/Client model [IJ is the common network and information integration model, which adapts to the traditional enterprise information network structure, as the fig.l shows. The information communication in this structure is from top to bottom.

Therefore, the disadvantage of this method is that the database is only supplied by the advanced server, which makes it difficult to guarantee the equipment data's accuracy and immediacy.

According to the demand of production field equipment workers, we design a new integrated information model, as fig.2 shows.

This new method changes the direction of information collection from bottom to up, and all the information is gathered in the middle level (usually the workshop server). It makes the data can be mutually accessed during the parallel level service computer rather than the advanced server. This model makes workers can easily input equipment data into the system, and it also makes the information more immediacy.

B. Security Level Setting  The equipment data is an enterprise's secret, so we have to consider the security of the data when designing the information system. We use the method that sets the security level to control the visit to the database [2J, that means the different security level client has different visit authority, for example, the production field level client's visit authority is      limited to the equipment technology resources, the workshop client can visit more data resources about equipment running.

The higher security level is, the more data it can visit, as the fig.3 shows.

III. DATA COLLECTION AND DATABASE IMPLEMENTATION  A. Data Collection  The defined data in device management comes from the equipment files, the spareparts statistics, and device malfunction time, etc. We have to transform these information to computer readable data. The main method we use is coding. Take the electrical sparepart as an example: we divided the switch as a class and headed with "Q", classified fuse as a class begun with "F", and classified rely as a class begun with "K" ...... and use the model number as  the data characterization. But the information during machine running is hard to transform. Now the common method enterprise used is to establish the special machine malfunction memorize (3], but it does not work well, considering the machine malfunction information includes each major department such as electrical, mechanical, hydraulic, computer science, we adapt a new scheme to classifY the equipment malfunction information, as figA shows. It classified the information into different parts according to each device major, and each category includes the detailed machine part information column.

B. Database Implementation  We use the method that establishes the basic data in workshop level, use the workshop serve computer to gather the equipment data information, classifY these data, and set the security authority.

The major tool we used to establish the database is the data management software SQL2000. The result shows that it can achieve the good results to meet the demand of research needs. And these data can be applied in future's corporation with production, selling, and enterprise marketing supply chain data system as well.



IV. EQUIPMENT MANAGEMENT JOB SYSTEM  According to the device performance specification, we classified the equipment management into device daily check [4J and machine malfunction detection and analysis.

A. Device Daily Check  As enterprise client requires, we design the special equipment daily check system. It makes workers do their daily check and memory work by computer. And this system has established the equipment files including machine's hardware information, sparepart statistics, malfunction  recording, maintain work plan, etc. To land the software photocap, the operators have to input their work ID as the security verification, then the equipment staff can use the system to achieve the equipment dynamic check, maintain plan, record and every operation that belong to their security authority, as fig.5 shows.

B. Machine Malfunction Detection and Analysis  According to the machine malfunction detection issue, we use the status of affairs detective management method, by detecting each machine's key control signal to monitor the machine's running status, and make sure the equipment is working properly.

We also encode the malfunction information [5J, to make it easy to transform the related data.
