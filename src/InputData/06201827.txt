A Mining Algorithm Based on  Time Series Association

Abstract- Based on the concept lattice theory this paper  studies the cycle of association rule mining about the periodic  fluctuations of time-series. First of all, do anti-season  pretreatment to time-series, then give the algorithm of the  generation of the cycle of association rules, and the pruning to  the generated concept within algorithm improve the efficiency  of the mining speed. And then we can use the given higher  precision model to do anti-season changes calculation to those  time series which dissatisfy anti-season pretreatment using the  moving average method.

Keyword- data mining; time-series; association rules;  formal concept analysis  I INTRODUCTION  At present, cycle analysis of time series is given increasing attention in the area of data mining , such as the discovery of time series-cycle model and cycle rules.  The cycle pattern mining is namely that in sequential database mine the recurring pattern. Cycle pattern mining can regard as a kind of sequential pattern  II TIME-SERIES  mining and use a group of divided sequence as the time of duration. For example, Cycle pattern can apply in many important areas, for example, the sales of these days before and after every Spring Festival. For example, season, morning and evening tides, planetary orbit, daily energy expenditure, daily traffic mode and all of the TV program in the specific time each week.

Time-series is the collection of data with time changes according to the time sequence.These data are usually  measured in equal time intervals, which have been widely existed in many fields of economic and technology[1]  The volatility of time series is that variable Dt goes up or down based on stable level  , such as stock daily fluctuations, scientific experiments, medical and so on. With the wide use of information technology, human beings possess more and more information about time series. Aimed at these mass history time series data, how to use new technology to convert these data to reliable knowledge information and then improve the human ability to forecast the future and to control the future events in advance has been closely watched by people.

[2-3]  Regard as time series analysis, we can use many straight forward method to test the changes of time series.

Sometimes the actual time series transfer according to some forms. Through this method not only stabilize the change of time series, but also can solve the problem of data dimension disaster.Smoothing is a method to remove unsystematic behavior in time series  . Faced with mass time series data, the question of discovering four hidden component part and its internal development and fluctuating regulations, then providing help for people to judge and decide something is one of the urgency, meanwhile it?s also an important aspect of data mining research.

[4-6]  III TEMPORAL ASSOCIATION RULES MINING PREPROCESSING  .

When time series in a certain time interval appear one kind of fluctuation, then we can get the coming fluctuation in the next time interval , namely ,we can do cycle association rules mining to the fluctuation of time series.

Chinese National Natural Science Foundation(61101116).

During this process, first of all, this theory use the method of moving average and do anti-season pretreatment to time series, then we can get the fluctuating sequence based on the average trend level. And then it can do cycle association rules mining to this fluctuating sequence. Finally, through the analysis of fluctuation in a new time interval and the comparison of mining rules, then can get the coming fluctuation in the future time intervals[7]  LLnm /  . Here combines the thesis of concept lattice with the algorithm of time series fluctuation, then come up with a new parallel algorithm of cycle association rules aiming at multiple-valued segments.

When calculating fluctuations in new time interval, it gives an anti-season forecasting model aiming at new sequence, and forecast the sequential value after dealing with new sequence using anti-season method, and achieve very high accuracy. Finally the theory realizes to find the fluctuations of the coming sequences. Because in the previous moving average method, when we calculate the trend, usually give up the sequential entries which are less than a step in the end of time series, which results that the recent factors most related to predicted value are neglected by people, which not only make the conclusion appear the masked error, but make this method lack of real-time usability. In order to make up for the previous moving average method, and combine traditional forecasting method with association rule mining method, it gives a model that if , then calculate  mD .

The above-mentioned model is tested in the simulation test using data that are record in different times of different economical activities. Experimental result shows that, the MAPE of this model?s experiment result is all obviously lower than established critical value 10, which shows this model is reasonable.

IV.TIME SERIES ASSOCIATION MINING  Definition one: if l  i  il AandAAAA  21 ,,, ,  then  formal context(O,A1,R) (O,A2,R),...,(O,Al,R) is the fragment of formal context(O,A,R),every background corresponding to concept lattice L(O,A1,R) L(O,A2,R),..., L(O,Al,R) L(O,A,R)is L(O,A,R)?s fragment of concept lattice , |A1|,|A2|,...,|Al| correspond to the length of fragment w1, w2,  wl  This two fragment concept lattice L(O,A  .

i,R) L(O,Aj,R)that correspond to the collection of concept areLi Lj If any one concept of Li is (Xi,Yi  |||| OXX ji  );any one of concept, then the support of concept association rules definesas || ji XX is the support counting, confidence coefficient defines as |||| iji XXX .

First of all deal with the sequence whose length is n according to the pretreatment method, then do segment handing forward. Time interval defines as  ],[ )1(1 LKKL GG , }/,,2,1{ LnK is the collection of section. Take section K as the collection of object; Take the sequence positions that correspond to every sequential entries{1,2,?,L} in every segment as the collection of     Multi-valued attributes. Take the sequence value as the attribute collection, and then establish multi-value form background. After standard division of properties according to the fluctuation ranges , and then give the threshold value interval corresponding to every properties, then take the property values allude to its threshold value interval, then lead to background. According to the actual characteristics (such as the hours, quarterly, etc.) of actual different time series and the actual needs of people, it defines the length of segment w1, w2,?wl  TABLE I. SEGMENT DERIVED BACKGROUND  . finally get the derived background, table I is an example of the segment?s derived background of certain time series. In the example, the property collection{1,2,3} is a subset of the whole property collection{1,2,?.L}.It?s length of segment is three, In this example ,the whole object collection is{1991,1992,?.,2006}.

When every segment do association rule mining in the proceed of t deriving background, then establish concept lattice to every segment and do pruning in the segment, this  decrease the time of data mining. Pruning within the segment is that according to the minimum support, then delete these concepts which are less than the minimum supporting counting ,and these concepts are in the collection that correspond to the concept lattice of segment, namely ,delete the concept whose extension include the number is less than the concept of minimum support counting. Through this decrease the number of follow-up mining data.

The algorithm describe as that:  Input: derive background (O,A,R) minimum support counting Z, the length of respective segment {w1, w2,? wl  Output : association rules collection based on lattice.

1) take (O,A,R) divide into orderly segment background according to the length of these segments  2) count the number of segments  3) for each segment background executive four to five times;  4) establish concept lattice ,then produce respective concept collection H  5) for(g=1;g<=count(H); g ++)  {  aim at the extension H(X) g and intension H(Y) g of g concept H(X,Y) g  if (count(H(X)  in the concept collection on the processor  g)<Z or count(H(Y) g  delete this concept H(X,Y)  <1))  }  g  6) conduct on the concept collection Hi and Hj  c=count(H  which come from two processors at random  i); d=count(Hj  for(k=1;k<=c;k++)  );  for(r=1;r<=d;r++)     {aim at the extension Hi(Xi)k and intension Hi(Yi)k of the k concept Hi(Xi,Yi)k)in the concept collection Hi and the extension and intention of the r concept in the concept collection Hj. if(count(Hi(Xi)k Hj(Xj)r)>=Z) output Hi(Yi)k=>Hj(Yj)r  Because in the rules on both sides of the?  ;}  ? are short period, so here call the left of ? ?as the precursor of the rule, and call the right of ? ?as the subsequent of the rule .



V.  CONCLUSION  Paper gives a high accuracy the model for  the calculation of the new time series fluctuations. This model can improve forecast quality. Subsequent, in the process of mining sequence fluctuations rules , raised a algorithm for more value of the background generated sequence association rules . Finally, with the rules match, completed the exact predict  for the future  fluctuations of sequence.
