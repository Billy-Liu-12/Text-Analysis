On Fuzzy Association Rules Based on Fuzzy Cardinalities

Abstract  The paper discusses the beneut of usiog fumy sets in data som- mries based on generalized association rules. Fuzzy sets provide a convenient interface between labels and data and allow for partial belonging to connes but distinct classes. They thus offer a robust reading of the data. Starting with fuzzy partitions of attribute domains which are meaningful for a user, a procedure is described which enables data sommaries involving fumy qonntifiers to be built, by compoting fuzzy cardinalities. The difference between this new type of fuzzy summary and previous proposals is also pointed out.



I. INTRODUCT~ON  During the last years, the number and volume of databases have tremendously increased and the need for extracting some "condensed" information has received attention. The related research area, called knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) or data mining, aims at the discovery of useful information from large collections of data. The discovered knowledge can be N I ~ S  describing properties of data, frequently occurring pat- terns, clusterings of the objects in the database, etc. Among the recent works, a great deal of attention has been paid to the dis- covery of a specific 'ype of rules called association rules [I].

Association rules are of the type "when the properties A and B are satisfied iu the data, then properly C is also satisfied". Let us give a simple formalization of the problem.

Given a schema R = {A,, ..., 4) of attributes with respective domains D,, ..., D., a relation r can be represented by a Boolean matrix in which a row corresponds to a tuple and a column to an attribute value. An association rule ahout r is an expression of the form: X 3 B, where X C R and B E R \ X. The intuitive meaning of the rule is that if a row of the matrix r has a 1 in each column ofX, then the row tends to have a 1 also in column B. This semantics is captured by the measures of frequency (or support) and confidence. Given W C R, we denote by sup(W, r) the frequency of W in r: the fraction of rows that have a 1 in each column of W. The frequency of the rule X 3 B in r is dcfined to be sup(X U {B), r) and the confidence ofthe rule is sup(X U {B), r)/sup(X, r).

In the discovery of association rules, the task is to find all rules X = B such that the frequency of the rule is at least equal to a given threshold a and the confidence of the rule reaches at  Cedex 4 - France  least another threshold 8. In other words, one wants to obtain rules that are sufficiently frequent and valid.

As stated by R. Yager [2], the use of fuzzy logic seems parti- cularly interesting in the context of howledge discovery inas- much as it allows to express properties about the current content of a database as statements of the natural language, thus provi- ding knowledge that can be easily understood by nonexperts. In this paper, we propose an extension of the notion of an associa- tion rule, based on the aggregation of sufficiently close data into fuzzy sets and un the use of fuzzy cardinalities.

The paper is organized into two main sections. Section 2 pre- sents the notion of a fuzzy association rule based on fuzzy car- dinalities. Section 3 describes an aggregation procedure which is performed on a non fuzzy relational database. It aims at re- placing the initial database by a fuzzy relational database which summarizes it. This summarization is made in terms of labels of fuzzy partitions of the attribute domains which are supposed to he given and to he meaningful for the user. This aggregation procedure is augmented with the computation ofthe fuzzy car- dinalities of the sets of items to which a given fwzy label in a cell of the new relation is applicable. Section 4 describes how it should he possible to generate linguistic summaries of interest (in the form of hrzzy association rules) !?om the summarized fuzzy relational database built in the previous section and the associated fizzy cardinalities.

11. FUZZY ASSOCIATION RULES BASBD ON FUZZY CARDINAUTLES  The starting point is to aggregate sufficiently close data into fuzzy sets, on the basis of fuzzy partitions which are meaningful for a user. Another key idea is to view fuzzy sets as a way for describing the different possible labellings that can be made by a user for borderline data.

A. Notaliom Let R he a (non fuzzy) relation involving attributes A, 8, C, _..

In fact, we assume that the user is interested in possible summa- ries (association rules) involving a given subset of attributes.

We only consider the projection of R on this subset, and for notational simplicity, we use a 3 element subset ofattribute, say A, B and C, in the following, which is sufficiently general for discussing the main issues.

Let (ai, b,, ct) denote a tuple of R(4 6, C) projected on attri- butes A, B and C. Let DA, Ds, Dc he the amihute domains. We  0-7803-7293-W01/$17.00 0 2001 IEEE 461 2001 I= International Fuzzy Systems Conference    assume that each domain is equipped with a fuzzy partition (Al, Az, ._.,A& (BI, Bz, ..., B 3 ,  (C,, Cz, ..., C,) respectively. Each fuzzy set in a partition is assumed to be normalized. Each parti- tion is ordered, and a fuzy sef say Ai, can only overlap with its predecessor Ai., or its successor Ai+l (when they exist).

We M e r  assume that a finite scale (with m + 1 levels) is used for assessing the membership degrees, namely 1 = a, > _..

> urn > 0. Each level corresponds to a different possible un- derstanding of & as the crisp level cut (A,),,? The use of a finite scale then greatly facilitates the computation of fuzy cardinalities, as it is shown in the following, without being a serious limitation in practice.

B. Principle The approach corresponds to a straightforward extension of  the usual d e f ~ t i o n  of an association rule. Its principle is the following: the validity of the rule (A, Ar) (B, Bs) depends on the number of tuples which are &on the one hand and on the number of tuples which are Ar and B, on the other hand.

For instance, using scalar cardinalities, the validity of the d e (A, AJ = (B, B,) can he defined as:  which is nothing but a straightforward extension of the usual definition of the confidence.

Remark 1. It is worth noticing that the principle consisting in: i) rewriting the data by means of a more general vocabulary, and ii) trying to discover properties in the rewritten database, has also been advocated in a "nonfuzy context". For instance, in [3], the authors use a hierarchy of (Boolean) concepts in order to "rewrite" a relation so as to discover different types of rules. See also [4] where the notion of a generalized association rule is introduced. Nevertheless, the fact of using linguistic labels (i.e., fuzzy sets) to rewite the data allows to discover more robust rules. The key point, with a fuzzy partition, is that the borderline data are taken into account in each of the two classes, which decreases the sensitivity to the boundaries.

Remark 2. In accordance with the linguistic nature of such an extended association rule, it is also possible to interpret the notion of validity in a flexible way, which corresponds to inho- ducing some tolerance and considering that a rule can be seen as perfectly valid, even though the ratio (confidence) above is strictly less than 1. The association rule obtained is then a fuzzy quantified proposition of the form "Q tuples of R that are A, are also B." where Q denotes a fuzzy quantifier such as "most of'.

The general principle described above has been advocated by Yager [2], and more recently by Kacpnyk [5 ] .  These authors use scalar relative cardinalities to compute the degree of vali- dity of a summary (i.e., of a fuzzy association rule). Scalar fuzzy cardinality, which amounts to the addition of membership degrees, considers a collection of several elements with small membership grades whose sum is 1, as equivalent to one ele- ment with full membership for instance; this might be debatable or even misleading h m  a user point of view. In this paper, we present an alternative fuzzy approach based on the use of fuzzy cardinalities. This approach constitutes an extension of those described in [6,7].

111. SUMMARIZING A RELATION  From the relation R (restricted to A, B and C), we build a new relation &,(for "R summarized") by a procedure involving two main steps which are now described. The idea is to perform a kind of information compression.

For instance, if A,(%) = I ,  B&) = 0.8, Bs+l@j) = 0.2, &.!(CL) = 0.6, CLCL) = 0.4, we give birth to the tuples:  (Ar 0.8/B, O.6/C,.1),(AC O N B ,  0.4/&), (& 0.2/BS+1 O.6/&.1), (Ar 0.2/8,+1 0.4/C3  where we keep track of the membership degrees (A, stands for I/AJ. This corresponds to all the possible "readings" of the tuple (ai, bj, c d  in terms of the vocabulary provided by the i iuzy partitions. In a data mining contexf it is not necessary to store the summarized relation &,. The only additional data that have to be stored are the fuzzy cardinalities, whose computation is described in the following subsection.

B. Fusion step and computatioo of- cardinalities We want to h o w  bow many tuples t o m  R are 4, are B,, are  G, are Ar and B,, ._., are Ar and B, and &, and this, for all the fuzzy labels. In order to have a more accurate representation of the relation, fuzzy cardinalities are used instead of scalar ones.

It is then necessaxy to compute the different cardinalities related to each linguistic label and to the diverse conjunctive comhina- tions of these labels.

All the tuples of the form (x/A, y/B, dCt) which are identical with respect to the three labels are fused into one tuple (A, B, q) of &,. At the same time, we compute the cardinalities Fq.

FQ,,  FA,^^, F B , ~ ~ ,  FQ,~,) is a fuzzy set defined on the integers {O, I ,  ... ) which represents the fuzzy number of tuples which are somewhat Ar (resp. B,, Cl, Ar and B,, A, and Ct, B, and Cl, Ar and B, and q) and which are fused into the considered tuple (for all the combinations of labels appearing in at least one  Each cardinality is computed incrementally in the following  FB,, Fc,, FA,B,.

he the current value of the fuuy cardinality  FA^ with 1 > hl? ...

t hk > = 0 and n t 0, k ? 0. Let us recall that this expres-     sion represents a cardinality that possibly equals at least n to degree 1 and possibly equals at least (n+k) to degree h~ [E].

Let us consider a new tuple whose A -value r e ~ t e s  Ar Let x' be the degree attached to Ar in this tuple. FA, must then be modified. If x' = 1, FA, becomes:  1/0+ ...+ l /n+ I/(n+l)+hl/(n+2)+ ...+ hk/(n+k+l) + O/(n+k+2) + .._ .

If x' < 1 , there are two cases. Either 3 i, x' = hi or not. If 3 i, x' = h, > hi+, then  FA^ is modified into:  U0 + _.. + Iin-l + l/n + hl/(n+l) + _.. + A,/(n+i) t &/(n+i+l) + ... + hk/(n+k+l) + O/(n+k+2) + .._ .

Otherwise, 3 j, 4 > x' > $+I (we assume that becomes:  = I )  and FA,  110 + ._. + l/n-I + I/n + hl/(n+l)+ ._. + $/(n+j) +x'/(n+j+l)+ $+l/(n+j+Z) + __. + hk/(n+k+l) + O/(n+k+2) + .._ ,  Note that the fuzzy cardinalities computed this way are such that Vi, j, Ai + 0, $ d 0, i > j 3 hi z 5. If, for the computation of FAr (resp. FE, et Fc,), one takes into account the value x' (resp. y' the degree related to B,, and z' the degree related to q), the computation of F+B, (resp. FAA, FB~c,  and F ~ B ~ c , ) , takes into account the value min(x', y') (resp. min(x', 2). mino.', z'), min(x', y', z')), thus reflecting the fact that the tuple to fuse is both A, and B, (resp. Ar and G, B, and G, A, and B, and C,).

Let us notice that the maximum number of tuples that can be obtained in %, is na 8 nb * nc, i.e. the product of the numbers of labels appearing in the considered partitions. Thus, the "summarized" relation can be significantly smaller than the original relation R for large relations.



IV. COMPUTINGTHB VALIDITY OF A SUMMARY  Fuzy cardinalities computed as explained in Section 3 can be used to evaluate the validity of fuzzy association rules. In this approach, we assume that the user indicates the attributes A, B or C that he/sbe is interested in. Two general forms of rules can be thought of. The fust type of rule follows the pattern "Q tuples of R are Ar and B,", where Q denotes a linguistic quanti- fier such as '"most of' or "few". This can be seen as a kind of degenerated rule with no attribute involved in the antecedent.

The validity of such a rule corresponds to the extent to which the set of labels (A, B,) is fiequent (if Q = "most of') or scarce (if Q = "few") in the sense of 9. The second type of rule corresponds to the pattern '"a proportion Q of tuples which are A, in R are also B,". The computation of the validity of the rule in each case is discussed in the following.

A. Computing/izzy relative cardinalities The two types of rules presented above relate to proportions.

It will thus be necessary to compute fuzzy relative cardinalities.

Let us denote by FR+ (resp. F R q  F R y  c,) the fuzzy pro- porUon of the tuples of R which are "A, &esp. "Ar and B,", s'  "Ac and B, and C,"). This fuzzy number is obtained by dividing each (more or less) possible cardinality appearing in Fq. (resp.

F p  Fqs,~,) by the number of tuples in R  or mstance, the fuzzy relative cardinality FRQs represen- ting the fuzzy proportion of elements in R which are both Ar and B, is obtained by replacing FQ, = 110 + ... + I/n + ... + &/(n+i) +... with F R q ,  = 110 + ... + l/(n/K)+ ... + Aj/((n+i)iK) +... where K denotes the number of tuples in R This means that the proportion of elements which are A, and B, at level h, is at least equal to (n+i)/K. Thus, the support of the fuzzy set F R q ,  is included in the unit interval.

B. Frequent and scarce sefs of linguistic labels Let us fmt consider the case where the user does not specify  any fuzzy quantifier. From the tuples in it is possible to produce summaries of the form ( A ~ ,  B., c,, ~ ~ q ~ q )  or relative to projections of R such as (A, B,, F R q S ) .  As in the nonfuzzy case, one produces the frequency, which IS now a fuzzy number.

Of course, these summaries will be given to the user in a li- guistic form expressing the variability of the cardinality (the fuzzy cardinality is then described by some proportions obtai- ned for different levels of possibility). Let us recall that these levels of possibility corresponds to the more or less '"elastic" interpretations that can be associated with the linguistic labels involved in the summary  Let us now consider the more general case where the user is interested in a summary such as "Q tuples .of R are Ar (or AT and B,, or Ar and B, and C,)" where Q denotes a predefined (and possibly fuzzy) quantifier Q.

The validity of a s m r y  as "Q tuples of R are C" can be defined as a degree expressing the extent to which we are cer- tain that Q tuples of R satisfy the fuzzy property C. For ins- tance, the validity of '"most of the tuples in R are A, et B," can be defined as the necessity of the fuzzy event "most of' with respect to the possibility dislribution F R q , .  It is equal to :  &rn t [o, 11 m(Q(4, 1 - F"~p$u)) which is nothing but a degree of inclusion of FR in Q. This validity degree expresses the extent to which the% propor- tion F R q  is, close to 1 (in the sense of Q). This degree can equal 1 o d y  if all the possible values in the proportion FR are totally compatible with the representation of Q. When% validity is less than 1 but is stricly positive, one can inform the user that the summary is rather true, and specify the value of the nonfuzzy threshold k such that the assertion "at least k % of the tuples are A, et B," is certain (whatever the interpretation of the linguistic labels - inside the limits of their supports).

C. Fuzzy association rules Let us now consider a fuuy association rule of the form: "the  tuples in R which are A, are also B,". We have available the fuzzy number of tuples in R which are Ar and B8 on the one band, and the fuzzy number of tuples which are Ar on the other band. Several approaches can be thought of, for instance:  - by analogy with the nonfUzzy case and with the approach based on scalar cardinality of fuzzy sets, it is possible to     compute the fuzzy quotient p = F e ,  I F+ enforcing the constraint that the fuzzy number F e ,  reshicts a value which is less than or equal to the value restricted by F b  (see 191). However, this quotient of such two fuzzy numbers may lead to a tw imprecise result.

- a more interesting approach consists in determining how the proportion of tuples which are (A,)a and (BJa with respect to those which are (A& changes when a varies, i.e., de- pends or not a lot on the interpretation of the linguistic la- bels (according to whether they are reduced to their cores or extended to their supports). Then, the computation involves three steps:  1) for each a appearing in F4 or FM 1.1) determine l(AJm1 and I(&B,)J (which can be di-  rectly read on the ruZy cardinalities wmputed as explained in section IILB);  1.2) compute c, = I(ltB,).I I [(&),l corresponding to the confidence value of the rule when the a-level cut is used to interpret the labels;  2) compute p? as the wnvex hull of the fuzzy number: ... + alc. + ... + lk,.

Given a confidence threshold 0 specified by the user, it is then possible to determine the highest degree a such that p?.

2 6. The association rule can then be expressed in a linguis- tic way, inasmuch as the a-cuts of A, and B, can be expres- sed in a linguistic way too. This approach in terms of a- level cuts of the cardinalities is m the spirit of [IO] althougb these authors compute scalar cardinalities as weighted ave- rages of cardinalities of a-cuts.

It is also possible to use a fuzzy quantifier Q (e.g., most of) in order to qualify the rule. The validity of the rule can then be defmed as the necessity of the fuzzy event Q relatively to the possibility distribution p?. It is equal to:  *E [O. 11 -(l4$u), 1 - P?W) which is nothing but the inclusion degree of p? in the quantifier Q. This validity degree evaluates the extent to which the fuzzy proportion p? is close to 1 (in the sense of the fuzzy quantifier).



V. CONCLUSION  This paper has outlined a new approach to the linguistic summarization of data bases. The basic ideas are i) to use fuzzy partitions of attribute domains which are meaningful for the user (since fuzzy partitions are more compatible with a linguis- tic labelling), ii) to perform a ?soft compression? of the data base and then to exploit it for evaluating potential summaries, iii) this evaluation is made by computing fuzzy cardinalities d c h  account for the possible variations of the interpetatioo of the labels. What is obtained are the (fuzzily known) proportions of elements satisfying fuzzy specifications.

Strictly speaking, the association rules obtained should not be confused with fuzzy rules, which are also of interest for buil- ding other kinds of summaries. For instance, checking if in a non-fuzzy database a gradual rule holds between two attributes, say A and 8, of the form ?the more the A-value is A, the more the 8-value is B? is not a matter of counting. Indeed, if we as- sume that some fuzzy set A of DA is given, it amounts to rank- ordering the pairs (ai, bi)?s according to the increasing values of the A(aJs and to looking for a ?B, belonging to some fuzzy label vocabulary, such that A(q) 5 B@i) for all i (if it is feasi- ble). An approach aiming at discovering such extended associa- tion rules based on d u a l  rules is described in [I I].

It is quite clear that the present work is in a preliminary stage and that the approach still needs to be studied in more detail. In pdcular ,  it will be necessary to test it against a sutliciently large database in order to assess the clarity and the relevance of the results obtained The design of optimization techniques aiming at reducing the complexity of the discovery process is also a matter of great impomce that should be dealt with in future works.
