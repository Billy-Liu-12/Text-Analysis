Encouraging Knowledge Sharing in Global Virtual Teams: The Interaction  Effect of Individual Difference and Perceived Sharing Benefits

Abstract  This study aims to examine how individual difference variable (i.e. exchange ideology) influences the relationship between perceived economic and social benefits and knowledge sharing behavior in the context of global virtual teams (GVTs). This study draws on social exchange theory and proposes that exchange ideology would positively moderate the relationship between three perceived benefits (i.e., extrinsic rewards, reciprocity, and image) and virtual team members? knowledge sharing behavior. Data were collected from 113 members of 13 virtual student teams consisting of participants from Asia and Europe.

Contrary to the team-member exchange theory, the findings suggest that, in GVTs, exchange ideology negatively moderates the relationships between extrinsic rewards, reciprocity and knowledge sharing, and had no moderating effect on the relationship between image and knowledge sharing. These results provoke theoretical implications that some contextual factors of GVTs may influence the moderating effects of individual difference. This study also provides some suggestions for the management of GVTs in knowledge sharing encouragement.

1. Introduction  Global virtual team (GVT) is ?a temporary, culturally diverse, geographically dispersed, electronically communicating work group? [27]. A potential benefit of ICT supported GVTs is that they can bring together individuals in different countries with the needed knowledge, skills and abilities (KSAs) regardless of their location [7]. In GVTs, knowledge sharing is one of the most important steps [25].

Without effective knowledge sharing, work team might not integrate experts? critical KSAs to accomplish the complex and innovative work [10]. Thus, how to encourage members? knowledge sharing behavior is  the important research issue in GVTs? knowledge management field.

However, one of the most salient problems which GVTs face is that people are unwilling to share knowledge with other members [10, 52]. Numerous prior studies have attempted explanations for people?s unwillingness in sharing knowledge [2, 22, 39]. A considerable body of literature adopts the framework of social exchange theory to understand people?s unwillingness to share knowledge, and suggests that KS in virtual teams is the process of social exchange [51]. According to social exchange theory, people will balance their costs and benefits before they share their knowledge [16, 51]. Lower benefits (e.g., reward) or higher costs on sharing (e.g., sharing effort) will lead to lower levels of KS [30]. Prior studies in virtual teams focus more on the barriers and costs of KS, and investigate how to reduce these costs, such as developing information and communication technology (e.g., groupware) to reduce time and effort costs of sharing knowledge in virtual teams [24, 37].

There is thus a major gap in the literature in that little research has focused on the benefits of KS in virtual teams which deal with motivating participants to share knowledge [4, 36]. Several empirical studies have found that the availability of ICT is no guarantee that KS will actually take place in virtual teams [1, 48].

The more critical reason for lack of KS in virtual teams is that participants cannot see the benefits from sharing their knowledge [25]. The present study adopts social exchange theory to investigate KS in GVTs from the perspective of benefits. According to social exchange theory, individuals share knowledge not only for economic benefits (e.g., pay) but for social benefits (e.g., image and appraisal) [30]. Therefore, the first research question of this study is whether economic or social benefits are effective for encouraging KS behavior in GVTs.

Our second question focuses on the moderating effect of individual differences on the benefits- knowledge sharing relationship: To different individuals, which benefits are effective or ineffective?

According to social exchange theory, the social exchange relationship is also influenced by individual exchange orientation [16]. In various variables measuring individual exchange orientation, exchange ideology (EI) is considered as a critical moderator, referring to the strength of a participants? belief that work effort (e.g., effort on sharing knowledge) should depend on treatment by the team [18, 44, 50]. In this study, we investigate EI as the moderator on the perceived benefits-knowledge sharing relationship in the context of GVTs.

This study contributes to KS literature in several ways. First, we examine the relationship between perceptions of benefits and KS behavior in the context of GVTs. Findings of this study suggest that perceptions of economic and social benefits are important antecedents of KS behavior in the virtual context. Second, our main contribution is to test the effects of EI on the benefits-KS relationship in GVTs.

The findings may have some implications for the management of virtual team leaders when they make decision on applying incentive mechanisms in KM.

2. Literature Review 2.1 Knowledge Sharing in GVT  A GVT has at least four characteristics: 1) virtual team works on the shorten project mostly; 2) team members come from different countries and are geographically dispersed; 3) all the members work interdependently for achieving team objectives; 4) members rely on technology-mediated communications rather than face-to-face interaction to accomplish collaborative work [25, 39, 40]. The potential benefit of GVT is that it can bring together experts in different countries with the needed knowledge regardless of their location [7]. Individual knowledge is the critical resource which is the foundation of a team?s competitive advantage. The movement of knowledge across the individual and geographical boundaries is dependent on knowledge sharing behaviors. Lack of adequate knowledge sharing may cause problems in the effectiveness and efficiency of work in GVTs. The research question is how to support knowledge sharing effectively in GVTs.

One stream of literature tried to develop technical solutions to support knowledge sharing across the boundaries of time and space. A variety of groupware systems and tools have been developed for information exchange, communication, or collaborative learning e.g., [21]. However, prior studies proved that  information and communication technology are no guarantee that knowledge sharing will actually take place e.g., [1]. The individuals? unwillingness to share is more salient in the lack of knowledge sharing [51].

This unwillingness may due to several reasons. First, individuals may fear losing the critical knowledge with the lack of trust about how information will be used by others [27]. Second, team members may fear that their shared knowledge get negative feedback from others [20]. Moreover, the individuals perceived not being supported by the team to share knowledge [25].

Focused on the ?willingness?, knowledge sharing behavior should be encouraged rather than forced.

Followed by the perspectives of cost-benefit, pervious studies argued enhancing material and symbolic benefits may encourage individual to share knowledge to others regardless the effort and opportunity cost [30]. Furthermore, social exchange theory can be applied as the guideline [51]. However, a major gap in the literature is that little research has examined the relationship between benefits and KS in GVTs.

2.2 Social Exchange Theory  Social exchange theory posits that individuals engage in social interaction not only for economic rewards (e.g., pay, bonus) but for social rewards, such as approval and respect [8]. In social exchange, resources given away by individuals can be seen as costs, while resources received as positive outcomes of exchange can be seen as benefits. Perception of high economic and social benefits received from exchange will enhance the individuals? social interaction behavior [16].

KS has been characterized as a social exchange involving the provision of experience and codification effort in return for economic and social benefits [30, 36]. Numerous studies have found that high perception of benefits will enhance the individual KS [9]. In virtual teams, social exchange theory has also been proven to be useful in investigating KS which can be seen as the process of person-team exchange [51]. In the virtual context, economic benefits have been represented as extrinsic rewards, reflecting explicit benefits of KS [32]. Social benefits have been represented as self-worth and reciprocal relationships, reflecting the extent to which individuals perceive how other members show concern for them [52].

In social exchange, the relationship between perception of benefits and social behavior also depends on the individuals? EI [16, 18]. Individual EI is seen to affect the salience of perceived benefits in shaping individual behavior [50]. Previous studies have confirmed positive moderating effects of EI on social exchange relationships in organizations [18, 49, 50].

Further, Lin [35] has examined the EI on the KS      relationship in the organization, showing that EI has a positive moderating effect on the relationship between participative decision-making and KS. However, some studies have also challenged these findings in other organizations. In a study that examined EI in member- union exchange, Sinclair and Tetrick [44] found no significant moderation effects of EI on the relationship between perceptions of union support and union commitment. They argue that results can be due to the nature of union: individuals can easily switch unions and become nonmembers. There is only the affective connection between union support and union commitment. A more self-interested, calculating individual might have free-riding tendency and be less likely to display a strong commitment to a union.

Especially in the synchronous and distributed organizations, high EI employees may have high free- riding tendency since their behavior cannot be monitored. Thus, the moderating effect of EI on benefits-knowledge sharing relationship should be explored in virtual teams.

Summing up, although numerous studies have focused on the relationship between economic and social benefits, and KS in co-located teams, limited studies examine this relationship in the context of virtual teams. Thus, the moderating effect of individual EI on benefit-KS relationship should be examined in virtual teams. This study fills the gaps by examining the relationship between perception of benefits and KS, and the moderating effect of EI on this relationship in GVTs.

Figure 1.  Research Model   3. Research Model and Hypotheses  The research model for exploring moderating effects of EI on the relationship between perception of benefits and knowledge sharing in GVTs incorporates constructs from social exchange theory. Economic benefits (i.e., extrinsic reward) and social benefits (i.e., reciprocity and image) are hypothesized to impact on  knowledge sharing contingent on individual exchange ideology (See Figure 1).

3.1 Economic Benefits  Knowledge sharing can be explained by economic exchange theory and social exchange theory. Based on economic exchange theory, individuals are rational self-interest. If the benefits exceed the costs, people may will to share knowledge [14]. In economic exchange, the benefits of knowledge sharing are extrinsic rewards, such as bonuses, improved payment and job security [5, 30]. In this study, perception of extrinsic reward can be defined as the belief that one can receive extrinsic incentives for one?s knowledge sharing. Numerous empirical studies examined the positive relationship between perception of reward and knowledge sharing, e.g. [36]. In virtual teams, some studies argued the lack of incentive scheme lead them unwillingness to share knowledge, and suggested to introduce a reward system, e.g. [25]. It is suggested that if the individuals? perceived reward is sufficient high, they will share their knowledge to maximize their benefits. Thus, we propose hypothesis 1a: H1a: Extrinsic reward perception is positively related to KS behavior in GVTs.

3.2 Social Benefits  In contrast to economic benefits, the benefits in social exchange are generally future return but not having exact price. In knowledge sharing, social benefits can be seen as the relational and reciprocal outcomes by the organization [30]. Prior studies argued several social benefits; especially intra-team respect and reciprocity may contribute the knowledge sharing culture in the virtual work groups [52].

Reciprocity behavior has been seen as a benefit of individuals engaging in social exchange [8]. The individuals? perception of reciprocity in knowledge sharing can be defined as the belief that current contribution would lead to future request for knowledge being met [30]. Previous research indicated that the individuals who share knowledge in GVTs have a strong sense of reciprocity [31, 52]. Researchers have found that reciprocal benefits can provide an expectation of establishing relationship of mutual cooperation, thus facilitate knowledge sharing behavior [36]. Thus, in GVT, if a member believe they can obtain reciprocal benefits from other members by sharing knowledge, they are more likely to share their knowledge. We propose hypothesis 1b: H1b: Reciprocity perception is positively related to KS behavior in GVTs.

In this study, image refers to the recognition of knowledge contribution to the virtual team by other  Exchange Ideology  Extrinsic Reward      Reciprocity  Image  Knowledge Sharing  H1a  H1b  H1c  H2a H2b H2c      members. In the working environments of organizations, employees can show others that they possess valuable expertise through helping other and then receive the respect from others. Furthermore, some studies found that appropriate feedback is critical in knowledge sharing [14]. If knowledge contributors think they can obtain good feedbacks from others, they earn the respect from others [14]. In the GVTs, fear of receiving negative feedback and reducing image in the teams may lead to team members? unwillingness of sharing knowledge [52]. It is supposed that if team members perceived to obtain good feedback and enhanced image in the team, they will share their knowledge to others. The hypothesis 1c is proposed:  H1c: Image perception is positively related to KS behavior in GVTs.

3.3 EI as a Moderator  EI refers to a pre-existing general belief system that characterizes an individual?s relationship with all entities with which they are involved, including professional association, work groups, etc. [41]. In this study, EI can be defined as the strength of a participants? belief that work effort (e.g., effort in sharing knowledge) depends on treatment by the team [18, 44, 50]. For example, in virtual teams, whereas some employees with low EI share with other team  Table 1. Constructs and Items Knowledge Sharing (KS): The degree to which one engages in an explicit and implicit knowledge sharing act. (Based on the work of Lee [34])  ? 1.

(IKS3) Exchange Ideology (EI): The individual?s expectation for and likely response to the person-team exchange (Based on the work of Eisenberger [18])  ? 1. A team member?s work effort should depend partly on how well the team deals with his or her desires and concerns. (EI1) ? 2.

A team member?s work effort should be related to the fairness of his or her reward (e.g., grades). (EI4) ? 5. The failure of the team to appreciate a member?s contribution should affect how hard he or she works. (EI5) Extrinsic Reward (ER): The belief that one can receive extrinsic incentives for one?s knowledge sharing (Based on the work of Kankanhalli et al. [30])  ? 1. I can get higher grades when I share my knowledge. (ER1) ? 2. I can get a better work assignment in the team when I share my knowledge. (ER2) ? 3. I can be praised by instructors when I share my knowledge. (ER3) ? 4. Sharing my knowledge can help me to meet the deadline for submitting deliverable. (ER4) Reciprocity (REC): The belief that current contribution would lead to future request for knowledge being met (Based on the work of Kankanhalli et al. [30])  ? 1. When I share my knowledge, I believe that I will get an answer for giving an answer. (REC1) ? 2. When I share my knowledge, I expect somebody to respond when I?m in need. (REC2) ? 3.

(REC4) Image (IMA): Perception of increase in recognition due to sharing knowledge (Based on the work of Kankanhalli et al. [30])  ? 1. Sharing my knowledge improves my recognition within my team. (IMA1) ? 2. People in the team who share their knowledge have more prestige than those who do not. (IMA2) ? 3. Sharing my knowledge improves other team members? recognition of me. (IMA3) ? 4. When I share my knowledge, other team members I work with respect me. (IMA4) ? 5. When I share my knowledge, other team members praise me. (IMA5)      members without regard to what they receive, others with high EI may be more sensitive to the outcomes.

Despite the different findings in the context of union [44], it is supposed that EI has a positive moderating effect on the perceived benefit ? KS relationship in the GVT. EI is a dispositional orientation, referring to the favor of the trade of work effort for material and symbolic benefits [18]. Ladd and Henry [33] report the EI as having a moderating effect on the relationship between perceived organizational support and organizational citizenship behavior (POS-OCB). This finding helps us to examine the EI influences on the sharing behavior among team members. For example, given that a team expects economic or social benefits to affect KS among team members, individuals with high EI will be very concerned about these benefits, and therefore share knowledge beyond the group?s normal expectations, while individuals with low EI are less concerned about the benefits of sharing knowledge, and may further dampen the effects of benefits. Considering that the perception of extrinsic reward, reciprocity and image has similar influences on the KS, we propose hypotheses 2a, 2b and 2c as: H2a (EI moderate Reward-KS): The relationship between reward and KS behavior will be more strongly positive with strong EI.

H2b (EI moderate Reciprocity-KS): The relationship between reciprocity and KS behavior will be more strongly positive with strong EI.

H2c (EI moderate Image-KS): The relationship between image and KS behavior will be more strongly positive with strong EI.

4. Research Methodology 4.1. Operationalization of Constructs  A cross-sectional survey instrument was designed to get information about all of the variables. We adapted existing scales to enhance validity. Some questions were modified to match the background of this study.

All the constructs were measured through seven-point scales anchored from ?strongly disagree? to ?strongly agree? or ?never? to ?very frequently?. A summary of constructs and items is listed in Table 1.

4.2. Survey Administration  The field study was conducted in a global virtual project program among universities which conducted by City University of Hong Kong, called BOHKNet (www.BOHKNet.com). The period of data collection is over 3 months, from September to December in 2006. The goal of BOHKNet project is letting students actually work together in a virtual team for problem- based collaborative learning. BOHKNet include several university from different countries, such as Beijing University of Technology (China), City University of Hong Kong (Hong Kong), Eindhoven Univesity of Technology (Netherland) and Tilburg University (Netherland).

Several part-time postgraduate students in four universities with different background (e.g. business and engineering) applied to join in the teams of BOHKNet and work together for solving different research questions. The BOHKNet team consists of 10 to 12 students in 3 locations. Each team was assigned a software-related topic (e.g. ?policy programs for e- service?) from different geographical perspectives. All the teams should discuss their topics from a European and Asian perspective, write the report in an integrated framework rather than simply connect different parts within the timeframe of 8 weeks. Members can upload and download documents, posted progress reports through electronic blackboard developed by City University of Hong Kong. BOHKNet also encourages members to communicate with each other in direct ways, such as using instant messengers (e.g. MSN) and VoIP technology (e.g. Skype). An incentive scheme for encouraging knowledge sharing was also introduced.

Team members can receive points and gifts based on the evaluation of their team performance on knowledge sharing process. For example, each team was encouraged to upload logs of their on-line meetings to the electronic blackboard. Teams? contribution was monitored and instructor conferences were held weekly to provide consistent team feedback. In the end of project, instructors would reward 3 teams based on their performance on knowledge sharing.

13 virtual project teams were willing to participate in the survey. Totally 147 participants in these teams  Table 2.

Most of the 113 respondents were males (71.7%), in the age group of 22 to 25 years (70.8%) and had work experience of 1 to 4 years (46.0%). Among 113 team members, 82 adopted MSN as communication tools (72.6%), 5 adopted Skype (4.4%), and 26 adopted other tools, such as email and electronic blackboard (23%).

5. Data Analysis and Result 5.1. Measurement Analysis  The descriptive statistics of the variables in this study is presented in Table 1. The adapted existing scales ensure the content validity of constructs. We assessed reliabilities of all constructs by calculating Cronbach?s alpha (See Table 2). All the Cronbach?s alpha values were found to be greater than 0.7.

The items were tested for validity using factor analysis with principle components analysis and varimax rotation (See Table 3). Convergent validity was assessed by checking loadings to see if items within the same construct correlated highly amongst themselves. Discriminant validity was assessed by examining the factor loadings to see if questions loaded more highly on their intended constructs than on other constructs [15]. Tabachnick and Fidell [47] suggested that loadings should be at least 0.32, and loadings from 0.45 to 0.54 are considered fair, 0.55 to 0.62 are considered good, 0.63 to 0.70 are considered very good and above 0.71 are considered excellent.

Factor analysis yielded 5 components with eigenvalues above 1. These 5 components corresponded to the 5 constructs. One question for ?exchange ideology? (EI4) tapped onto other constructs and was omitted. After omitting EI4, the reliability of the exchange ideology construct improved to 0.75.

Control Variables  Previous studies suggest that gender [28, 35] and age [28] may have an impact on knowledge sharing.

The basis of sex and age differences in thinking and behavior may influence the formation of knowledge sharing. In this study, gender and age of participants are included as control variables.

5.3. Hypotheses Tests  In this study, moderated multiple regression (SPSS 14) was used for testing interaction effects. Interaction terms are computed by multiplying two independent constructs. A significant change in explanatory power between the two steps indicates the presence of moderating effects. The procedure of hypotheses tests is: 1) the control variables (gender and age) were entered in the first step of regression; 2) the independent constructs were added in the second step; 3) the interaction terms were entered in the third step of regression. The R2 value of 0.32 and adjusted R2 value of 0.26 indicated the explanatory power of model was satisfactory (F = 8.42, P < 0.001). The change in R2 value between step 2 and step 3 was 0.09 (F change = 4.38, P < 0.01). Table 4 summarizes the results of hypotheses tests.

Discussion Based on our findings, image did not significantly  affect individual KS behavior. This may be due to the fact that the research project of surveying the virtual teams in this study was short-term. In a virtual team when members work on a short-term project, they might not have enough time to gather sufficient information about their co-workers to establish mutual trust [29]. There is an interaction effect of image and mutual trust in the social exchange relationship [6]. In the teams without mutual trust, high perception of image might not enhance individual KS behavior. In BOHKNet, each project lasted about 8 to 10 weeks.

Before the project, members of the virtual teams did not know each other; after the project, they might not meet each other again. Under such circumstances, if members share critical knowledge, they may be appraised. However, it requires a long time to establish mutual trust. In virtual teams with a timeframe of 8 weeks, the interaction time may be too short for establishing considerable mutual trust among members.

Moreover, the technology-based communication in virtual teams replaces the face-to-face communication in organizations which leads to a lack of mutual trust among team members and reduces the positive influence of image on peoples? willingness to share knowledge [39, 40].

One of the most interesting findings is about the negative moderating effects of EI. Many researchers have emphasized the positive moderating effects of EI in the relationships of perceived benefits and social exchange behavior, such as KS and organizational citizen behavior. From the perspective of social exchange theory, an individual with strong EI is more responsive to the perceived benefits, thus enhances the reciprocal effort (e.g., sharing knowledge) for receiving benefits. However, contrary to the hypotheses, this study shows that EI negatively moderates the relationship between perceived benefits and KS in the GVTs. That is, members with strong EI show little or no KS behavior as the response to the economic or social benefits. A reasonable explanation for this negative moderating effect can be found in research on exchange natures of social exchange [41, 44]. Redman et al. (2005) suggest that the effects of EI vary according to the specific nature of the exchange in different types of organizations. In this study, the novel findings may be due to the characteristics of virtual teams in the BOHKNet.

The negative effects of EI can further be explained in two ways. First, the short-term exchange nature of virtual teams leads to members showing little response to longer-term benefits of reciprocity. EI is concerned with the extent to which individuals believe that their own reciprocating behavior (e.g., knowledge sharing)  should be a function of the benefit they receive from the social exchange [18]. An individual with strong EI will calculate whole benefits from social exchange, and choose to share or withdraw other knowledge [35].

However, the factor of the timeframe should be considered in calculating the benefits of exchange. In social exchange, the benefits include not only the benefits of the current exchanges, but also some additional benefits of future exchange [11]. ?Rational? individuals will compare the net benefits of all future exchanges with the cost. They may be willing to accept a less-than-hoped-for outcome in the short term because they believe that they will receive their desired outcomes over time. Thus, an individual with strong EI may show more work effort than the organization expected. In this condition, EI may have a positive influence on the relationship between social benefits and KS. However, in short-term teams, members will focus on the benefits from current exchange [17, 42, 43]. In this study, all virtual teams did short-term projects in only 8 weeks. In contrast to a long term reciprocal relationship in the organization, members in BOHKNet could help others and receive help from others during the limited time of two months. Although members may perceive high levels of short-term reciprocity in the project, ?rational? individuals may also be concerned with the lack of future and additional benefits from longer-term exchanges. Based on the cost-benefit calculation, they will show a lower level of KS than the response to the benefits. In contrast, individuals with weak EI have general expectations on the benefits. They will share the knowledge as a normal benefit of reciprocity. Thus, in this circumstance, EI has negative moderating effects.

Second, due to some other characteristics of BOHKNet teams (e.g., group size, task nature and leadership), individuals with strong EI may show a higher free-riding tendency to minimize effort on knowledge for a high benefit of reward, while individuals with weak EI may show a normal response to the incentives. Different from the long-term relationship in social exchange, economic exchange has been seen as the one-off exchange without a timeframe. However, our findings suggest that EI buffers the positive relationships between reward and KS in the virtual context. That is, individuals with strong EI may show little or no effort on sharing knowledge even when they perceive incentives, while individuals with weak EI may show a positive response to incentives. This requires further explanation. A possible explanation for this negative effect is found in the free-riding theory. In this theory, the basic free- rider problem is that ?the individual will fail to participate in collectively profitable activities in the absence of coercion or individually appropriable      inducements?[45]. Based on this theory, a rational actor will have a free-riding tendency to gain outcomes of collective incentives with little or no effort on KS.

The free-riding tendency is related to several characteristics of work group, such as 1) group size, and 2) leadership [3]. Some characteristics of virtual teams in BOHKNet may have led to the free-riding tendency of individuals with strong EI. A group member?s decision to free ride results from a comparison of the net expected benefits of contributing to the group?s common interest and the net expected benefits of free riding [46]. Some factors account for the influence of group size on free riding: e.g., noticeability. Previous studies have found that individuals in larger groups contribute less knowledge than those in small groups [12]. In BOHKNet, the reward to encourage KS was team-based with each virtual team having 10 to 12 members; this is larger than most studies with work groups of no more than 8 people [19, 26, 38]. Moreover, most virtual teams in BOHKNet adopted video conferencing and instant messenger (e.g., MSN) for synchronous interaction and KS. These collaborative technologies support low additive capabilities (e.g., tracking) where GVTs can track and notice if a member contributes knowledge to the whole team [13]. Therefore, in these large and distributed teams, team members may not notice if a member contributes knowledge to the whole work.

Thus, individuals with strong EI may be prone to gaining benefits with sharing little or no knowledge.

One way to assure the provision of public goods is management control [3]. A group manager can review the process of KS, give feedback to each member and distribute outcomes to individuals based on the evaluation of effort on sharing knowledge. Many studies indicate the importance of the role of a leader in virtual teams [23]. In BOHKNet, virtual teams were not required to assign a leader in each team. Thus, members with strong EI may free ride with lower effort for the same benefits with others.

7. Implications and Limitations 7.1 Implications for Theory  This study contributes to the KS literature in two ways. First, it provides a more complete understanding of KS relationship in GVTs from the perspective of benefits. It also demonstrates that several economic and social benefits (extrinsic reward, reciprocity) can influence the KS behavior in the context of virtual teams. Apart from identifying benefits influencing KS in virtual teams, this study fails to confirm that personal image appears to impact KS in short-term GVTs. Personal image is thought to be the motivator in encouraging KS. However, in our study, this is not a significant concern for members to share knowledge.

Future research should investigate further how perceived image influences KS dynamics in GVTs.

Second, this study shows that the impact of benefits on KS in GVTs appears to be moderated by individual differences (i.e., exchange ideology). Further, this explorative study suggests that the effects of EI on KS may be different in different contexts. For example, the results of the study suggest that EI may have negative moderating effects on the relationship between reciprocity and KS in virtual teams with short-term projects. These results are contrary to hypotheses developed from social exchange theory in organizations with longer-term relationship. More research is needed to verify this.

7.2 Implications for Practice  The findings of this study offer virtual teams some guidelines on how to promote KS in the virtual context. As significant findings for influences of some benefits on KS, several strategies could be considered.

First, an incentive scheme should be introduced to encourage individuals to share knowledge with the rules about ?different strokes for different folks.? A portfolio of incentives could be provided to different individuals for everyone favouring the outcomes of their sharing effort. Second, managers of virtual teams can raise the perceptions of the reciprocity benefit among team members by highlighting regular and frequent meetings for exchanging ideas and discussing new team-created solutions.

Further, the finding that strong EI as a moderator tends to block or suppress economic and social benefits is especially interesting as virtual teams consider strategies to encourage KS. Some functions, such as supporting user identity and sending notices of contributions should be applied in the formal KS process for helping to track whether a member contributes knowledge to the whole work or not. It is also surmised that the moderating effect of reciprocity is negative due to the short-term project. Management of virtual teams should encourage members to establish longer social relationships through informal ways, such as communicating and adding friends through software, such as instant messenger (e.g., MSN and ICQ) and VoIP technology (e.g., Skype). Several strategies could be considered to avoid the free-riding behavior in virtual teams: 1) limiting the group size so that each member?s work effort is noticeable; 2) emphasizing the role of the leader for evaluating each member?s work effort and distributing team-created outcomes to members.

7.3 Limitations and Future Studies  Our findings must be interpreted in light of the limitations of the studies. First, common method      variance may bias our findings to some degree.

However, findings concerning the direction of interaction effects may be less susceptible to common method bias than are those concerning the significance of main effects. Second, this study was based on a sample of 113 respondents, and although several significant results were obtained, a larger sample bringing more statistical power would have allowed more sophisticated statistical analysis. Third, this study collected data in a short-term virtual project in the universities. These samples may reduce the generalization of this study. Future studies should investigate virtual teams in the wider field (e.g. long- term projects, and different tasks), and compare results between short-term and long-term projects with more different tasks.

Future research could extend our study to account for the remaining inadequately explained effects of EI in several ways. First, future research might usefully examine the effect of EI in different contexts, including collocated projects and virtual communities. Second, followed with some additional research perspective, such as free-riding theory, future studies could examine other unexplained variance in the relationship between perceptions of benefits and KS.

8. Conclusion  In GVTs, KS has been seen as the social exchange process whereby individual members share knowledge for material and symbolic benefits. Further, the individual differences whether members favour benefits obtained from KS or not, should be an important indicator in knowledge management practices in GVTs. In this study, we examined the individual EI as a moderator of the KS relationships.

Surprisingly, we found that people who favour the benefits strongly may withdraw knowledge. This finding is consistent with some studies showing a negative reaction to incentives from the perspective of free-riding behaviour. A possible explanation may be in the short term project and large group sizes in the teams that we surveyed. In these contexts, ?rational? people may free ride with low opportunity cost. We believe that this finding contributes to theory by showing that individual differences may have a different influence on KS in different working contexts. In practice, we suggest that the management of virtual teams should be careful with incentives. This study poses interesting research questions for future investigation.
