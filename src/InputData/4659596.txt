Mining Positive and Negative Association Rules in Multi-database Based on  Minimum Interestingness

Abstract   With the increasing development and application of information and communication technologies, multi- database mining is becoming more and more important. Association rules mining is the major topic in multi-database. According to Piatetsky-Shapiro?s argument, an association rule is interesting only if the rule meets the minimum interestingness condition. In this paper, we extended this condition to mine association rules in multi-database and improved it to check the correlation of association rules. An algorithm PNAR_MDB _on P-S measure is proposed and the experimental results demonstrated the algorithm is effective.

1. Introduction   Database mining has emerged as a major application area for an efficient discovery of the previously unknown and potentially useful patterns in large databases. Traditional association rule mining has been mainly focused on identifying the relationships strongly associated among itemsets that have frequent and high-correlation. It is the form X?Y call positive association rules (PARs). As an important supplement, the other three forms X??Y, ?X?Y, ?X??Y call negative association rules (NARs) which can catch mutually exclusive correlations among items, they can provide much useful information and play an important role in decision-making.

Nowadays most of the techniques of NARs mining focus on mono-database. Rapid strides made in the communication network technology and distributed database systems have led to the development of several multi-database systems for industrial  applications. For effective decision-making, global organizations are required to mine the multiple databases that are distributed through out their branches.Multi-database mining can be defined as the process of mining data from multiple databases, which may be heterogeneous, and finding novel and useful patterns of significance.

In this paper, we mined the same category databases based on the databases classified into several group. In [1] proposed a method of synthesizing rules by weighting. But it only considers positive association rules; this will leave out much useful information probably, so we will synthesizing the frequent itemsets in different databases, this way can avoid knowledge conflicts   within   databases may occur when mining both the positive and negative association rules simultaneously, Moreover, according to Piatetsky- Shapiro?s argument, an association rule is interesting only if the rule meets the minimum interestingness condition. This condition is extended to mine association rules in multi-database which can prune the rules, whose interestingness is low.

The main contributions of this paper are as follows: 1. We revision P-S interestingness and extended it to  mine association rules in multi-database.

2. An algorithm PNAR_MDB _on P-S measure is  proposed to discover PNARs in multi-database.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows.

The related work of P-S interestingness   Mining association rules can be described as follows: Let I = {i1, i2?in} be a set of N distinct literals called items. Let D be a set of database transactions where each transaction T is a set of items such that T?I. Each transaction is associated with a unique identifier, called TID.

Let A, B be a set of items, an association rule is an implication of the form A?B, where A?I, B?I, and A? B=?. A is called antecedent of the rule, and B is called the consequent of the rule. The rule A?B holds in the transaction set D with support supp, where supp is the percentage of transactions in D that contain both A and B. In other words, the support of the rule is the probability P (A? B). The rule A?B also has another measure called confidence conf, where conf is the percentage of transactions in D containing A that also contain B. In other words, the confidence of the rule is the conditional probability P (B|A).

Mining association rules is the process of discovering those association rules whose supp and conf meet some user specified minimum (minsupp) and minimum confidence (minconf), but some association rules satisfies this condition is not interesting.

According to Piatetsky-Shapiro?s argument, if supp (A?B)? supp (A) *supp (B), then the rule A?B is not interesting. The rule is interesting only if meet the condition : supp(A?B)?supp(A)* supp(B)?mininterest, The people are familiar with  calling this condition the P-S interestingness, and mininterest>0 is given by the user or the expert, but P-S interestingness is not Consider negative association rules  In[2]the author extended this condition to negative association rules ,if  the rule A?B is interesting only if meet the condition that | supp(A?B)? supp(A) * supp(B)|?mininterest,this revision not only mining negative association rules but also check the correlation of association rules. corrA, B = supp (A?B)? supp (A) * supp (B) (1) If corrA,B >0, then A and B is positively correlated (2)If corrA,B =0, then A and B is independent, (3)If corrA,B <0, then A and B is negatively correlated  Negative association was first noted by Brin et al.

[3]. Savasere et al. [4] proposed a method to mine strong NARs. In [5] the authors proposed a PR (Probability Ratio) model and proposed a new method to discover both positive and negative association rules. In [6] the authors proposed a PNARC (Positive and Negative Association Rules on Correlation) and proposed a simple but efficient method to calculate the support and confidence of NARs through positive association rule?s, furthermore this model can detect and delete those self-contradictory rules by correlation.

A method of mining positive and negative association  rules based on multi-confidence and Chi-squared test is proposed in [7], this method solved a dilemmatic situation of using a single confidence threshold. [8] proposed a new measure VARCC and proposed an algorithm PNAR-MLMS which can mining positive and negative association rules from frequent and infrequent itemsets.

3. Association rules in multi-database  based on minimum interestingness  3.1 Database weighting and synthesizing  frequent itemsets   In order to synthesize frequent itemsets from different databases in the branches of a company, the weight of each database must be determined. In [1] the author assumed that, within a company, each branch, large or small, has equal power to vote for global decision-making. In a pure business sense, all branches are not equal; the branches which have high volume of business will have and should have a greater say in determining global policies based on global patterns.

So in [9] the author made a fair assumption that a large number of transactions imply high volume of business, for example, if there are two databases D1 and D2and if D2 has twice the number of transactions of D1, then effective vote for D2will be two as compared to one of D1. This approach is in tune with the practice followed in the real world applications.

Let D1, D2?Dm be m different databases from one class of the branches of a large company, Num (Di) is the number of transaction of Di, the weight of Di as follows:   ( )  ( ) I  i D m  i i  N u m D  N u m D ?  =  = ?    After we got the weight of database, we can synthesize the frequent itemsets. Let FSi is the frequent itemsets of Di, ?1, ?2??m are the weights of D1, D2?Dm respectively, globe minsupport is minsupp?, for the frequent itemset X, synthesizing model as follows: supp?(X) =?1?supp1(X)+?2?supp2 (X) +?+?m ?suppm (X)  conf? (A?B) = ( ) ( )  supp A B supp A  ?  ?  ?  Where supp?(X) is the support of X after synthesizing, conf? (A?B)is the confidence of the rule A?B after synthesizing, because of adding weighting ,the support of synthesized itemsets is changed ,so we remove those frequent itemsets whose support can not meet minsupp?.

3.2 Mining association rules in multi-database   We revision P-S interestingness and extended it to mining association rules in multi-database. If the rule A?B is interesting only if it meet the condition that |supp?(A?B) ?supp?(A)*supp?(B) |?mininterest. The correlation of association rules can solve the self- contradictory rules, so we improved the P-S interestingness. Let the correlation of the synthesized frequent itemset A and B is corr ?(A, B)  Corr ?(A,B)= supp? (A?B)?supp? (A)supp? (B) Where supp?(A?B), supp? (A), supp? (B) is the  support of frequent itemset AB, A, B in each database after synthesizing. If corr?(A,B)>0 then (1)corr?(A,?B)<0 (2)corr?(?A,B)<0 (3)corr?(?A,?B)>0,and vice versa. The theorem is the same with reference [2] (1) If corr?(A,B)>0 we mine rules of the forms A?B and ?A??B (2) If corr?(A,B)<0, we mine rules of the forms A??B and ?A?B (3) If corr?(A,B)=0, there is no rules generated  4.  Algorithm design  Algorithm: PNAR_MDB _on P-S measure Input: FS1, FS2?FSm: the frequent itemsets database  D1, D2?Dm minsupp?: the threshold of the globe support, minconf: the threshold of the confidence ?1, ?2 ??m: the weight of database D1, D2?Dm mininterest: the minimum of interestingness Output:  PARs and NARs: ? FS ? {FS1, FS2?FSm}; PARs =?; NARs =? ? for each frenquent itemset X in FS do  supp? (X) =?1?supp1 (X) +?2?supp2 (X) +?+?m ?suppm (X)  If supp? (X) <minsupp FS ?FS -{X}  ?for each synthesized frequent itemset X in FS do For any itemset A?B =X and A?B=? do {  If|supp?(A?B)?supp?(A)supp?(B)|?mininterest then {  If supp? (A?B) ?supp? (A) supp? (B)>0 then { If conf ?(A?B) ? minconf then  PARs = PARs? {A?B}; If conf ?(?A??B) ? minconf then  NARs = NARs? {?A??B}; }  If supp? (A?B)?supp? (A)supp? (B)<0 then  { If conf? (A??B) ? minconf then  NARs = NARs? {A??B};  If conf? (?A?B) ? minconf then NARs = NARs? {?A?B};  } };  ? output PARs and NARs   5.  Experimental results   In order to demonstrate that our method is effective, we do the experiment on AMD3000+,1.8GHz, 512RAM,WinXP,PowerBuilder6.5,suppose three databases is D1,D2,D3, the number of transaction is 4,6,10,as follows: D1={(A,B,D); (A,B,C,E); (A,B,C,D); (B,C,D); } D2={(A,B,C); (A,C,D,E); (B,C,D); (B,D,E); (A,C,E);  (A,B,D,E); } D3={(A,B,C); (A,B,C,D); (A,B,C,E); (B,D,E);  (B,C,D,E); (A,B,C,D,E); (B,C,E); (C,D,E); (A,C,D,E); (A,B,D,E); }  So the weight of database is ?1=0.2, ?2=0.3, ?3=0.5, we set the minsupp is 0.3, 0.3, 0.4, minsupp?=0.2, minconf=0.3. We synthesized frequent itemset by the weight of database after got frequent itemsets by Aprior. Table.1 is the number of association rule generated by PNAR_MDB _on P-S measure .Flag=11, flag=12, flag=13, flag=14 denote association rules of the form A?B, A??B, ?A?B, ?A??B respectively.

Table 1. The number of association rules  interestingness 11 12 13 14 prune Total 0 24 4 4 24 ? 56  0.03 20 4 4 18 8 48 0.06 18 4 4 18 12 44  Put databases in single data by  Apriori 75 ? ? ? ? 75   From table.1, we can see that the number of  association rules by Apriori is 75, but by the method of our proposed, the number is decreased obviously. At the same time, with interestingness increasing, the number of pruned rules also increases. This means that the interestingness can be used to prune less valued rules effectively.

6. Conclusions and future work   When mining multi-database, because the factor of volume of business , profit and so on is different ,so the weighting of  database is different, synthesizing the frequent itemset which in different databases, which can avoid Knowledge conflicts   within   databases may occur when mining both the positive and negative association rules simultaneously, Moreover, according     to Piatetsky-Shapiro?s argument, an association rule is interesting only if the rule meets the minimum interestingness condition. This condition is extended association rules in multi-database. This way can prune the rules, whose interestingness is low.
