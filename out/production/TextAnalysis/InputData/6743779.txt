Archaeology has long utilized visualization as a technique to analyze and disseminate information; however, comprehensive and collaborative analysis and storytelling with this visual data has always been limited by the capacity of the systems, which create and display it. To present the most complete narrative of the past, one must seek the ?big picture? by assembling the disparate pieces of data, which reflect the lives of the humans we study. This paper presents a framework for the visualization of and interaction with rich data collections in high resolution, networked, tiled-display environments, called the MediaCommons Framework.

The MediaCommons Framework allows massive media collections to be viewed and interactively analyzed and was developed in lockstep with innovative, portable and scalable visualization environments such as the OptiPortable [1] and the CGLX software stack [2]. While the OptiPortable was designed to be an easily deployable, scalable hardware system for networked, tiled-display walls, CGLX was designed as the software stack needed to run low-level graphical applications in these environments. The MediaCommons Framework aims to further enable software development for such tiled-display environments by abstracting away the complexities introduced when using a networked cluster. The framework allows researchers to investigate the smallest details of their data while never losing sight of the entirety of the data set, a task that cannot be accomplished by switching windows on a desktop or by shuffling papers. Room-sized display environments, literally allow the user to step into the data, mediated through physical and virtual interaction, enabling users to navigate around the display environment in person and digitally, cognitively analyzing and clustering media for ease of analysis.

Through the MediaCommons Framework, big cultural heritage data sets of differing formats can effectively be displayed and structured using a broad range of media types and presentation formats, including images, documents, videos and 3D models, for high-resolution comparative analysis. This enables detailed inspection of a subset of media items within a  larger context. This data can be viewed and arranged locally within a single environment or shared with collaborators in similar environments across the world, connecting researchers across space and time, providing a means for international collaboration. CISA3 has effectively used these systems to collaborate locally, nationally and internationally.

Multiple case studies explore the visualization and dissemination of complex collections of data for precise analysis, with particular reference to displays of multimedia archaeological data. Case studies include real-time analysis of field-acquired data, post-expedition data synthesis and correlation, as well as multi-modal data communication to diverse target audiences via a Museum of the Future prototype.

Among them was the exhibition ?Exodus: Out of Egypt (Transdisciplinary Perspectives on Archaeology, Text and Memory)? [3], and its presentation of human remains collected from sites in the Wadi Fidan region of Jordan, including a tomb containing over 23 individuals. The MediaCommons Framework serves as an intuitive platform for both analyzing complex spatial data as well as effectively disseminating it by enabling a detailed yet holistic perspective for storytelling.
