1 INTRODUCTION

Abstract:  Key Words: , ,      value measures, support and confidence, denoted by sup(R) and conf(R) respectively. The support of an item set, X, has support, s, in transaction set, D, if s% of transaction in D contain X. Then,  YXYXR sup:sup ,  XYXYXRconf sup/sup: Different transactions may contain same itemset,  especially for remote sensed imagery. This suggests a way to eliminate duplicate calculation. Some concepts are given below.

Let U = {t?| t? is any possible transaction}, while D = {t| t is a transaction already happened}.

Definition 2.1: A pattern, p, is a non-empty itemset. A transaction pattern, is a pattern that belongs to transaction.

PD is all transaction pattern set,  DttIternsettPD ,|.

Each transaction has a transaction pattern. Different  transactions may have same pattern.

Definition 2.2: A possible pattern, is a pattern of  possible transaction. PU is the set of all possible patterns.

UttIternsettPU  '' ,|'  Let be the superset of I, so ||2|| I  Lemma 2.3: |||||||;||| UDD PPDP  Definition 2.4: The occurrence of a transaction pattern p, is the number of transactions whose itemset is p, i.e.,  occur (p) = | { t | t D, t.Itemset = p } | = |D|*sup(p) For market basket data mining, any itemset can be a  customer?s transaction. So |PU| = | |. In this case, two different transactions rarely have the same transaction pattern, i.e. |PD| |D|. However, in multiband satellitic image data, each transaction (pixel) has the same number of items which is the number of bands, different pixels may have different reflectance values, but after partition, they may belong to the same interval for all the bands respectively and share the same transaction pattern. So, for multiband satellitic image data we usually have |PU| | |, |PD|<<|D|  Example 2.5: Multiband satellitic images are large.

For example, TM images cover about 170 kilometers square and there are about 6500 rows of pixels and 6500 columns of pixels, totaling about 40,000,000 pixels.

Suppose we are interested in four bands: 1(Red), 2(Green), 3(Blue), 4(Yield). Each pixel has a reflectance value within {0, 256} for each band. As an example (Fig. 1), we can divide each band into 4 intervals [0,64), [64,128), [128,192), [192,256) denoted by the interval numbers, 0, 1, 2, 3. Figure 2 shows transaction patterns and their occurring frequencies.

Count occur for each transaction pattern p  In this example, we have I = {R=0, R=1, R=2, R=3, G=0, G=1, G=2, G=3, B=0,  B=1, B=2, B=3, Y=0, Y=1, Y=2, Y=3}; |I| = 16 D = {pixels}; |D| = 40M PU = {{R=k1, G=k2, B=k3, Y=k4}| k1,k2,k3,k4 =  0..3}; |PU| = 44=256  = superset of I, so K6422 16|I|  Thus we have, MDPP UD 40256  KPP UD 64256  We propose a modified apriori algorithm in which we do not need to scan the transaction database in each pass, only one pass is needed to construct the pattern occurrence counting table.

It prunes some impossible patterns such as the combination of intervals from same band. So C?[k] <C[k], and C?[K] can be much smaller than C[k] in some situations.

From Figure 3, the time to find frequent k-itemsets are: TOld[k] = O(|C[k]| *|D|) a*|C[k]|*|D| TNew[k]=O(|C?[k]|*|PD |) a*|C?[k]|*| PU | =a*|C?[k]|*| PU |,  The time to find all 1 to N item frequent sets:  DkCaDkCaT N  k old ****   U  N  k U  N  k UNew PCakCPaPkCaT ******  '   '   '  (C is the sum of |C[k]|, C? is the sum of |C?[k]| and a is a constant)  UUUNewOld PDPDCCPCaDCaTT //*/**/**/ '' I  n Example 2.5, |D| = 40M, 256UD PP , so  TOld / TNew > |D| / | PU| = 40M / 256 =156250 This means for 4-interval partition, the modified  apriori algorithm is about 156250 times faster than the original apriori algorithm.

When each band is divided into 16 intervals, |PU| = 164= 65536, we have TOld / TNew > |D| / | PU| = 40M / 65536 610  5 CONCLUSIONS  In this paper, we propose a new and efficient approach for Association rule mining on multiband  image. The approach is based on transaction patterns and occurrence counting. The following are the advantages of this approach:  It simplifies the counting of support.

It avoids scanning over the entire transaction database each time in generating frequent k-itemsets.

It makes rule generation much faster.

It?s especially useful for multiband satellitic image.

With this approach, mining association rules on remotely sensed data will be much easier, faster and more practical.
