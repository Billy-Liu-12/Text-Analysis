Abstract? The quantification of energy budget of big cities  has gained a high interest in the recent decade considering it?s  link to global change and to the energy nexus. The  management of the energy consumption in large cities is  following a new revolution as we enter the era of smart cities.

But our knowledge of the different components of the energy  budget at local scale is still limited.  Recently with the  development of high spatial and temporal resolution satellite  imagery and the widespread of 3D databases of the urban  canopy, new physically based deterministic approaches to  quantify the energy budget components are being developed.

In this study, which is part of the H2020 URBANFLUXES  project, we show results on the combined use of remote  sensing data and 3D radiative and energy budget modeling in  urban canopies. The approach relies on the combination of  physical modeling and remote sensing data in visible and TIR  from LandSat-8 over the city of Heraklion and Basel in  Switzerland. The modeling is based on the use of DART  (Direct Anisotropic Radiative Transfer) model with a new  Energy Budget module DART-EB that takes into  consideration the complexity of urban canopies.



I. INTRODUCTION  The evaluation of energy budget in urban canopies is evolving towards high resolution 3D modelling to enable the quantification of the distributed energy components including the anthropogenic one. This is breaching the gap between energy budget for architectural applications and urban energy budget in climate research. This is a major stack for the twenty first century as the number of mega-cities is evermore expanding so there is need to have robust tools to assess the energy consumptions of the cities in order to elaborate adapted managing strategies and to put in place climate change mitigation solutions from local to city scale. Recent advancement in geomatics and remote sensing is delivering high temporal and spatial resolution data that can be a major asset in this evolution. This is one of the questions investigated by the H2020 URBANFLUXES project (www.urbanfluxes.eu) [1] to which this study pertains. In this  study we show the use of such data in the deterministic 3D modelling tool DART [2] (Direct Anisotropic Radiative Transfer) (www.cesbio.ups-tlse.fr/dart). The computation of the energy budget components over urban canopies requires the use of a radiative budget model, a convective heat model, a sensible heat model and an anthropogenic fluxes module. At large scales contextual energy budget models like TEB [3] are widely used. But at local scales these models lack the description of the complexity of the urban canopy?s geometry and surface properties. We investigate here whether a 3D radiative budget model can provide accurate and spatialized results. This approach requires extensive sources of data for geometry and surface characteristics which are currently facilitated by the availability of 3D urban databases and remote sensing data. These data can be used in the urban environment for two main objectives: parametrizing the physical model or analysing the dynamic changes in the surface states. In this study the two objectives are investigated.

In the first objective the visible and thermal remote sensing data from LandSat8 are used to retrieve iteratively the spectral response at high resolution. This method [4] is based on the iterative inversion of the outputs from the 3D RT model DART to determine the spectral properties of each element of the scene in 3D and at high resolution.  The method is also used to disaggregate the LandSAT8 thermal data at high resolution. In the second objective, the outputs of the first approach are used to force the spectral properties in the coupled RT and EB simulations using DARTEB. The two way coupling is done via the surface temperature. An overview of the approach in terms of inputs, outputs and coupled information is presented in Figure 1. A brief presentation of the two coupled models is also given. The results of the coupled model are then compared to the disaggregated surface temperature data from LandSAT8.



II. MATERIALS  This study concerns the cities of Heraklion, Greece and Basel, Switzerland.

A. Remote sensing data  Remote sensing data from LandSAT-8 satellite are used.

Additional data from Sentinel-2 are considered. Sentinel-3 data will be considered upon availability. The images were atmospherically corrected using ATCOR tool by the DLR team and using complementary information on the atmosphere status to ensure a proper modeling of the scenes.

B. Urban database and in-situ data  3D models of the areas of interest (LCZ ? Local Climate zones) of each city were implemented. The models contain 3D buildings, water surfaces, digital elevation models and trees.

In-situ data on surface temperature, material optical and thermal properties are used in the different models and the validation of the approaches. Data over Basel city are provided by the University of Basel team and over Heraklion from the FORTH team [1].



III. METHODS  A. 3D radiative modeling using DART  At the centre of the modeling and inversion approaches used in this study is the DART (Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer) model. DART is a comprehensive physically based 3D radiative transfer model that simulates the Earth-atmosphere radiation interaction from visible to thermal infrared wavelengths. It simulates optical signals at the entrance of imaging radiometers and LiDAR scanners on board of satellites and airplanes. It also provides the 3D radiative budget of urban and natural landscapes including atmosphere an impact of topography. A vast array of instruments properties can be configured: sensor altitude, spatial resolution, UV to thermal infrared. A special attention is given for numerical solutions in DART by using multi- spectral discrete ordinate techniques with exact kernel, RayCarlo method, etc. DART is available from Paul Sabatier University as freeware for scientific non-commercial use. [1].

B. DART for Urban Canopy Properties  The urban environment is generally constituted of a large number of materials. Each material, due to climate alteration or original constitution, has a different spectral response. In many cases inner heterogeneities are observed in the same roof. This can be due to development of organic materials, humidity or exposure. Remote sensing data provides information on the spectral response at a given projection plan. On the other hand DART can compute the same information using a-priori spectral properties of the surfaces.

We introduce here an iterative calibration method that computes the actual optical properties for each type of elements in the scene per pixel or group of pixels of the satellite image. It provides the desired spatial variability in optical properties of urban elements contributing to the scene.

We consider N different types of urban elements and subdivide the satellite image used for calibration in groups of M x M pixels, where each group contains more pixel than there are types of elements. Then, we compare the desired satellite radiance value and the combined contributions simulated by DART of all the elements over the groups of pixels. This leads to the solving of an equation system for the updated optical properties of the elements:   (1)  where  is the radiance of element n computed  by DART for satellite pixel m,  is the satellite  radiance for pixel m,  is the optical property of element n  used in DART at iteration k, for group of pixels u, and  is the optical property of element n to be used in DART at iteration k+1, for group of pixels u.

We solve (1) for all the pixels groups over the satellite  image and obtain the new values  for each urban element.

We apply this method for each considered spectral interval and then interpolate the results to get the full spectral radiative properties of the elements. This process is repeated iteratively in order to converge towards optimal optical properties that can be used for more accurate 3D radiative budget computation. The products generated by DART serve then as inputs for the DARTEB model, to produce the energy budget.

This also contributes to one of the major objective of the H2020 URBANFLUXES project: inquire parameters of urban canopies from satellite data.

C. USE of DART for 3D CouplED RT & EB  When modelling radiative transfer in the thermal domain the emitted radiance depends on the surface temperature of the objects. This information is not readily available and a dynamic (time dependent) energy budget model is needed to derive it. On the other hand the energy budget depends on  the 3D incoming radiation that can be modeled using the 3D radiative model. Thus there is a strong two-way coupling between energy budget and 3D radiative transfer. Here we  Fig. 1 Summary of the operational loop in the coupling between DART and DARTEB    present the DARTEB model which is a coupling between DART 3D radiative transfer model and 1D energy balance model. The two way coupling is done by exchanging the 3D surface temperature, as can be seen in Figure 1. It simulates the major energy mechanisms (heat conduction, turbulent momentum and heat fluxes, soil moisture, etc.) that contribute to the energy budget.

The main energy balance equations are similar to the TEB urban surface scheme [3]. The main difference is that a vertical wind profile is considered and a vertically dependent wall resistance is considered. The concept of a mean aerodynamic temperature is maintained as shown in Figure 2.

Each surface type (wall, soil, and roof) is discretized into layers for simulating conduction fluxes to/from the ground and building interiors.

Fig. 2  Representation of a urban canyon DARTEB  The 3D radiative budget and 3D temperature are assessed with a prognostic approach. A two way coupling is done at given time steps through surface temperature. Temperature values at time t lead to the 3D TIR (Thermal Infra Red) and energy budgets at time t+1, which allows one to compute the 3D temperature distribution at time t+1, using the 3D visible and NIR radiation budget at time t+1.  Although, it uses an actual 3D radiative budget and it applies TEB equations at each point of the 3D scene, DARTEB is not a full 3D model (e.g., 1D wind profile is used instead of 3D wind distribution).



IV. RESULTS  The iterative retrieval approach presented in section 3.1 was successfully conducted on the city of Basel, one of the study sites for the URBANFLUXES project. The data used is from a LandSAT-8 image of the city taken on April 4th, 2015.

Figure 3 shows high resolution reflectance maps derived from LandSAT-8 30m data in for ground elements and roof elements. The results show inner roof heterogeneities which were not depicted in the original LandSAT-8 image due to resolution. This proves the ability of the approach to retrieve pixel based spectral properties. But some high values (>0.4) are observed over limited areas. They are due to compensation  effects between the contributing elements in the scene. An additional moving grid algorithm is under implementation to remove these artefacts.

DARTEB was successfully validated [4] in the frame of the CAPITOUL project [3] of Meteo France for simulating the time evolution of the temperature of walls in a street of Toulouse (France). Here the model is applied to the Heraklion, Greece, site (Figure 5) and to the Basel, Switzerland site (Figure 6). In the two cases the results show a coherent dynamics of the surface temperature. The profiles in Figure 6- (c) show the temperature difference between the upper and lower wall obtained using the 3D approach.

V. CONCLUSIONS  We assess here the usefulness of the combined use of 3D radiative transfer modeling and remote sensing data for the evaluation of urban energy budget. Results are shown over Heraklion and Basel cities. The result show that spectral properties of the urban canopy surfaces can be retrieved using an iterative approach with DART simulations and LandSAT8 images. These are then used to compute the incoming radiation over the 3D urban canopy. They are also used to force the spectral properties of the 3D urban canopy in a coupled 3D radiative transfer and energy budget model (DARTEB). The DARTEB simulations show physically consistent results over the city of Basel and Heraklion. Surface temperature profiles extracted in several control points exhibit high contrasting values proving that a 3D modeling approach can increase accuracy. Future work will focus on reducing the observed bias and then on the use of thermal components to improve the estimate of anthropogenic fluxes anomaly between remotely sensed thermal signature and modeled thermal signature.
