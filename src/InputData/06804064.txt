Implementation of the Temperature and Narrow  Channel Dependence on Threshold Voltage Model of

Abstract?In this paper, a new simplify mismatch of temperature and narrow channel dependence of threshold voltage of NMOS developed from spice level 3 and BSIM3 are proposed.

The IDS -VGS  in  linear region was used with a different channel width. The parameters extraction procedure is based on the measurement of the transconductance characteristics of MOSFET in linear region. In this model, the temperature coefficient for threshold voltage and the body-bias coefficient of threshold voltage of a big MOSFET and a   narrow channel width of MOSFET are determined. The results show that, the deviation of threshold voltage from the predicted model compared with the experimental data is less than 5% .

I.  INTRODUCTION The threshold voltage (VTH) is the one important  parameters of MOSFETs. There are many difference effects on the threshold voltage when the devices are scaled to submicron[1-4]. The temperature dependence on the threshold of MOSFETs have been determined in the reference literature [1,4,8].In previous published work, the threshold voltage dependence of temperature parameter (TCV) is introduced and the usage of TCV is quite simple[2,3]. As known that, the parameter TCV is not the same value for the difference dimension of MOSFETs.

The narrow channel effect, the increase of VTH as the channel width is scaled down is model by taking into account the extra bulk charge at the edge of the channel such as the existence of field implant and non-planarity due to the Local Oxidation of Silicon (LOCOS) process. The threshold voltage in Level 3 model [2] which sums up the above feature is given below:  TH TO S S S BSV V F V= ? ? + ? +  ( )N S BS D DSF V F V+ + ?

One of the main parameter is the low field mobility decreased with temperature also the ?S and VFB which decreased with temperature. But the intrinsic concentration (ni) is increased with temperature [5]. With the data from process simulation, the surface concentration is approximately a value of 1?1017cm-3. The ?S and ni versus the temperature are shown in Figure 1. ? is  body bias coefficient. FN is the correction factor of a narrow channel. FS is a correction factor for short channel effect. FD is a coefficient of static feedback. The parameter DELTA and ETA can be fined as in [1,2].The electrical characteristics of MOSFETs normally are strong dependence on the operating temperature [3].For big MOSFET (large W, large L), FS?1, FN ?0. The threshold voltage equation of big MOSFET at a specific temperature and substrate bias is defined as   ,TH B TO S S BSV V V= ? ? + ? +                          (8)        2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9 3.0 3.1 3.2 3.3 3.4   T     (oC) 200 175 127 100 85 50  Ni Phis  1000/T       (1/K)  n i   (c m  -3 )   0.50  0.55  0.60  0.65  0.70  0.75  0.80  0.85  ?

In this paper, The temperature dependence of the MOSFET parameters as well as the narrow channel width effects on the threshold voltage over the operating temperature range  of 27- 127 degree Celsius  and the new simplicity mismatch model are presented. The predicted model of the temperature dependence on threshold voltage in Eq. (13) and measured data are compared.



II. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE   A.  Devices Fabrication The NMOS test devices in this paper were fabricated by Twin-Well 0.8 CMOS technology (TMCN08) from Thai Micro Electronics Center (TMEC). They start with p-type substrate of 25 ?-cm of resistance. The p-well was form by boron ion implantation with a doping concentration of 1?1016 cm-3. A self align n+ poly silicon  gate process 350 nm of thickness  was used with gate oxide 15 nm of thickness. A BF2+ ion implantation  with dose of 1?1012 cm-2 and 70 keV of energy for threshold voltage adjust process in a channel was implemented in order to match the threshold voltage of the NMOS and PMOS device, as require in the modern CMOS technology process. The scalable device test structure has been design for different device geometries: Big dimension (W=20 ?m, L= 20 ?m) and narrow dimension (W= 20 ?m ,10 ?m, 3.0 ?m 1.6 ?m and 1.4 ?m , L= 20 ?m). The testing NMOS devices using a precision semiconductor parameter analyzer B-1500A with a thermal chuck in the range of 250C to 200 0C in manual operating.

B. Devices Measurements The threshold voltage measurements for testing device were performed by measuring a set of log DSI versus GSV  by the linear extrapolation methodology. The most common threshold voltage measurement method is the linear extrapolation method using the maximum slope technique of IDS and VGS which the drain current is measured as a function of gate voltage at low drain voltage of typically 100 mV to ensure that the operation is in linear region. Hence, the IDS versus VGS is extrapolated at IDS = 0 and the threshold voltage is determined from the extrapolated or intercepted gate voltage VGS by VTH=VGS-0.5VDS as shown in Figure 2. Figure.3 shows the threshold voltage versus drawn channel width with an operating temperature as a parameter. The channel width reduction value was approximately 0.5 ?m/side of NMOS.

III.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Fig.3 shows the threshold voltage versus temperature with drawn channel width as a parameter. The threshold voltage increased rapidly for the drawn channel length lower than 3.0 ?m for all operating temperature. The KT1,B is approximately a value -0.39 V for a big MOSFET and is a value of -0.42 V for a narrow channel MOSFET respectively. Fig.4, as you seen that, the slope is almost the same value for all operating temperature In this prediction model, the single slope for all channel width is used for all operating temperature. The slope of this graph is approximately 5.2?10-6 with unit of V-um.

From the slope value, The DELTA can be finding in [11], the DELTA is a value of 0.86, 0.90, 0.95, 0.98 and 1.02 at 27, 50, 75, 100 and 127 degree calculus respectively. Then the threshold voltage temperature coefficient of DELTA (TCVDELTA) is approximately 1.6?10-3 per degree calculus.

The correction factor for narrow channel FN can be finding in [10],the correction factor for narrow channel that  is increased as the design drawn channel width is decreased and increased rapidly as the drawn channel width lower than 3.0 ?m for all operating temperature are shown in Fig.5. In Figure 5, the parameter KT1,FN   can be neglected for large channel width and this parameter is a key parameter as the channel width is decreased. The significant parameters of narrow channel affect and the temperature dependent on threshold voltage are listed in Table I.

This parameter is a significant value on the narrow channel MOSFETs and can be neglect on the big MOSFETs. Due to the DELTA, channel width effect parameter, thus the VTH is increased as the channel width decrease. The measured VTH versus predicted mismatch model of NMOS  at various temperature with W=1.4, 1.6, 3.0 and 20 ?m at zero VBS and -5V of VBS  are shown in Fig.6, and Fig.7 .

IV. CONCLUSION In this work, a novel simplification mismatch model of  temperature and the device dimension dependence on the threshold voltage based on spice level3 and BSIM3 model  are developed and proposed. The extracted threshold voltages are determined from the linear extrapolation methodology. The deviation of threshold voltage from the predicted model compared with the experimental data from the 0.8 um CMOS technology with LOCOS isolation technology is approximately    3%.In near further, this predicted model will be used for the 0.5 um CMOS with different isolation technology in TMEC.
