Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka  Ayer Keroh, Melaka, Malaysia sanusi@utem.edu.my     Abstract - Current plan checking process has been a tedious and time consuming process for developers and local authorities with many errors and problems. This may result to a late of building development progress and can cost a big number amount of money. The aim of this research is to build a software information system that integrates development plan using computer-aided design (CAD) and to evaluate the development plan according to the standards. The compliance plan will be stored into knowledge-based repository for use by other local authorities for checking purposes. This building plan checking system (BPCS) will also acts as a repository for the development plan configuration standards in the data processing system. BPCS also serves as an assessor for the building components in the development plan to determine compliance of the development plan configuration with the development plan configuration standards using in the system.

Keywords: Knowledge-Based, CAD, Building Plan

I. INTRODUCTION Before any building development starts, an architect needs to submit the building plan to get an approval. The building plans need to be sent to several local authorities for checking purposes. The checking process should be made to make sure that the building plan is comply with the building configuration standards. Once the development plan gets the approval, then the building development can be started.

However, the current working flow consumes more time and it may leads to wrong evaluation because the checking processes were done manually. All local authorities need to do manual checking for each part of the building whether it comply with the standards or not. It may lead to missed checking some important parts of the  building and all the local authorities need to check for their own specific parts. Refer Figure 1.

Figure1: Manual Checking Work Flow   Therefore, the motivation to develop BPCS is to overcome the manual process problems and to computerize the plan checking process. The objective is also to speed up the checking process.

Knowledge- based repository will be used to store all the compliance building structure plan for the use of other local authorities to do checking.

As overall, the paper contents are organized as follows. Firstly, the related works will be discussed. Then, the frameworks design is delivered followed by the future works including the hardware and software that will be use in this research. Finally, the conclusion are presented.



II. RELATED WORKS According to [1], knowledge-based system (KBS) answers the specific questions that analyst   DOI 10.1109/ICFCC.2009.65    DOI 10.1109/ICFCC.2009.65     pose and gives advice to enhance their problem solving abilities. This is important because if an organization wants to keep the cost of solving the problem as low as possible. KBS is graded according to its coverage, accuracy and speed in resolving the problem.

While according to [2], it is a well-known fact that for individuals ?learning from failures? is a painful but successful process to create knowledge.

Experiences are stored in knowledge bases which are accessible by means of diagnostic tools.

Repetitive errors in production were reducing significantly.

But, in [3], knowledge-based repository is being used for storing and retrieving business components. In their component-based development (CDB), finding the right components quickly is vital to developing business applications.

As the number and variety of components increases, the component knowledge-based repository provides a viable approach to classifying components.

However, [4] developed a software management system to maintain a balance between tracking needs of management, the creative needs of software developers and reliability needs of software users. The knowledge base is used as the configuration database, code repository and the file system itself.

Refer to [5], the knowledge-based is applied in order to integrate multi-type data in a hospital environment. Through the introduction of knowledge-based modules, the architecture will be able to provide an active support in the execution of the various task (e.g selection and retrieval of data), also by improving the basic functionalities provided by the underlying (traditional) tools.

As refer to all the current and past researches, knowledge-based repository can act as an informative database to store information. It is useful for any systems that apply reusable technique. The selective data will be stored in knowledge repository and will reduce time for the same situation for future usage. Therefore, knowledge-based repository is being chosen in BPCS to save all the valid parts of the building plan during checking. Later, all the local authorities could share the information in knowledge-base repository while doing the checking process.



III. FRAMEWORK DESIGN  To build BPCS, we proposed a framework as shown in Figure 2. The framework consists of components such as data from project building plan configuration (CAD building plan), data processing  from the CAD building plan, development plan configuration standards and development plan configuration standards compliance results.

BPCS receives an input for providing a development plan to be checked to the system in a form intelligible to the system. The data processing system contains standards against which the development plan is to be checked, also in a form intelligible to the system. An evaluation program is to be used for evaluating the development plan according to the standards. An output ? knowledge based repository receives results of the evaluation.

Figure 2:  BPCS Framework   The BPCS application starts with the CAD building plan being submitted and the building plan configuration will be extracted out from the CAD design. This process will be done by a CAD converter software program. The data will then be stored in a repository for building plan data as an input for data processing system.

In the data processing system, a checking process which contains a plan check program will do the checking for building plan standards against the building plan data. An intelligence analysis is to be used where it compares to the specification used that analyzes factors such as rules used, object used, material used and etc. Results return by the system is a list of compliance items and not limited to lists of non-complying.

The results of evaluation will be stored in a repository ? knowledge base contains a comprehensive of compliance design information.

This information is vital for local authorities to refer to when they carried out the checking process.



IV. FUTURE WORKS  In future, BPCS simulates the project building plan compliance checking as follows:    CAD  Building  Checking Process   Building  Plan St d d   Building Plan Data   KBS ?  Complianc     It identifies physical characteristics of the building plan components such as exterior doors, interior windows, rooms and etc.

It determines the components of building  material used and also the composition.

It determine compliance of the development plan  configuration with the development plan configuration standards using the control program in the data processing system by evaluating the development plan configuration in the form of multiple dimensional equations.

It determine site or structure boundaries in the  development plan configuration with the data processing system by finding maximum and minimum values of the site or structure in three dimensions.

It may also return material lists with the  inspection requirements including a check-off list.

The codes and symbols may be looked up in a regularly updated and published in electronic boards for reference.



VI. IMPLEMENTATION HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE  BPCS will be implemented under PC Windows using the .NET platform and object oriented programming language. The BPCS architecture design is generic and the scope is of BPCS knowledge base is limited to structural buildings.



VII. CONCLUSION  BPCS approach increases the flexibility of computer ?supported work for the local authorities when they do the checking process by applying knowledge based techniques. The actual work process for plan checking may consume more time.

Hence, BPCS has advantages by providing alternative solutions and executions steps to the actual process.
