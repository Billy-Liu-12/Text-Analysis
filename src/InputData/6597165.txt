Big Data Infrastructure for Active Situation Awareness on Social Network Services

Abstract? Awareness computing aims at our final goal in computer science to simulate human?s awareness and cognition.

Awareness of social network knowledge in everyday life is actively enabled by big data society. In this paper, we investigate infrastructure for big data analytics for social network services, and propose TF-IDF calculation on big data infrastructure to be aware of social relations on social networks.

I. INTRODUCTION Computing technology is going toward ultimate goal,  simulating human being. Important issue of simulating human is being aware of situation (context).  One typical architecture to achieve the situation awareness consists of 3 layers (Fig. 1) which is from perception at the bottom to project of the top requires various technologies [1]. To deal with the awareness seamlessly, perception of object or data pattern should be well-geared to comprehension of a new situation based on reasoning of rules and ontology. Active situation awareness (ASA) is to aware a new situation more actively. We suggested a framework for ASA.  Our research has been motivated by construction of enhanced ASA framework for big data analytics on social network data set.

The social network information gives us useful knowledge and prediction for our better everyday life. The social big data can be perceived  in the perception layer. In this research, we provide a new framework to consider the social big data analytics and an experiment for it.

We organize the remainder of the paper as follows: Section 2 first introduce the background and related work of active situation awareness. Section 3 describes the framework of active situation framework with big data infrastructure. Section 4 shows a simple Hadoop algorithm for TF-IDF and its experiment on the big data infrastructure.

Section 5 shows conclusion and future work.



II. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK OF SITUATION AWARENESS FRAEMWORK  Ontological fundamentals for the comprehension and the perception such as STO and SAW core ontology have been constructed [2]. The ontologies provide fundamental vocabularies for SA and being aware of situation by  reasoning on the ontology. Other rules are integrated into the system . STO and SAW ontology provide basic entities for describing general situations considering time, space, and theme. However, it is still difficult to aware detailed situations on even a specific domain through inference on the ontology. An application of semantic technology such OWL, SWRL to SA, SAWA framework was introduced. SAWA integrate ontology and rule together using SWLR rule in OWL.

III. SCENARIO ON SOCIAL NETWORK SERVICE AND ARCHITECTURE  A. Scenario When I was in my office, a student came in. When I  shake my smart phone, the phone tells me the followings about the student based on information on the Facebook:  - The Opponent's Name: Leo Saito - He has interest to me - Saito has Events (Part Time Job, Date) - Saito has changed his topic from food to research  For the perception of his interest, it needs to create his feature vector for his interesting topic. TF-IDF is usually used for the value for elements in the feature vector.

B. Archtiecture Integration the three layers (Fig. 1) by ontology for  seamless computation of SA has been designed in the first stage. The framework considers the perception layer with  2013 IEEE International Congress on Big Data  DOI 10.1109/BigData.Congress.2013.61     high accuracy on a specific domain by ontology learning and mining data by information retrieval method on the generated ontology for the domain. The information would mesh with the upper layer for the comprehension seamlessly in the architecture. In our new scheme, to support big data of SNS or smart grid as data infrastructure, we put a distributed file system such as Hadoop and data manipulation engine under generic Web service layer. The service layer provides logical service to carry out the function of the perception layer. The big data infrastructure to support the services for perception is shown in the Fig. 2.

IV. EXPRIMENT FOR BIG DATA INFRASTRUCTURE We choose TF-IDF operation that is used for data mining on SNS frequently as analysis of performance on big data infrastructure.  It can be an illustration for performance of our architecture.

A. TF-IDF Operation on Big Data Platform The TF-IDF operation uses MapReduce [3] function 3  times. The first MapReduce operation read words in document file and output number of a word in a document.

The output data format is Word@Document title,Number of Word in a Document. The second time MapReduce operation read the 1st Reduce function output and produce output of  Word@Document title, (number of words in a document / number of word in all documents). The third operation read the second operation output and output TF- IDF value of each a word in a document. The algorithm 1 is Algorithm of TF-IDF on Hadoop.

B. Experiment for TF-IDF Operation We created texts of 5GB size  like SNS data. Words in  documents are created random on the basis of dictionary.

The Fig. 3 shows time cost for computing TF-IDF using each operation. The result shows that when we increase the computing resource linearly, the computing cost for TF-IDF decreases linearly.

V. CONCLUSION We constructed a general active situation awareness framework with three layered awareness architecture, and service layer to provide basic data mining functions for percaption layer with big data infrastructure. An elaborated infrastructure to cover various data mining algorithms to provide big data anlytics with lower time cost is being investigated.
