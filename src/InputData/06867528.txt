ABSTRACT This panel explores the many roles of data analytics in today?s cross-domain collaborations.  In some instances, cross-domain analytics are required to understand big data.  In others, big data holds the key to understanding and evaluating how people collaborate across domains.  Panelists will present their experiences with big data and collaboration, and discussion will be guided by the following questions:  How does ?understanding data through collaboration? relate to ?understanding collaboration through data??  What modeling tools, visualizations, abstractions, and metrics can help facilitate collaborative discovery from big data?  To what extent should these tools be tailored to specific domains or groups?  How much do we need to know about another domain or group before we can intersect domain specific activities that constitute the context to various analytical processes, and cross-pollinate ideas for deeper analytics? What optimally would that other domain or group need to know about us?  How much of this knowledge can we extract from data?

May 19 - 23, 2014, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA     PANEL SESSION II    Goals and Challenges of Collaboration in Healthcare    PANEL MEMBERS: Obinna Anya Accelerated Discovery Lab, Almaden Research Center, California, USA Neale R. Chumbler Department of Health Policy and Management, College of Public Health,  University of Georgia - Athens, Georgia, USA Saif Khairat Institute for Health Informatics, University of Minnesota ? Twin Cities, Minnesota,  USA Joseph A. Konstan  Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Minnesota ?  Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA  MODERATOR:  Danilo Pani  EOLAB ? Microelectronics and Bioengineering Lab, Dept. of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Cagliari, Italy    ABSTRACT Collaborative technologies are pervading every aspect of the modern society, influencing the way we act, work and interact. In healthcare, the benefits of collaboration are well validated. Collaborative technologies and systems in healthcare and the biomedical fields potentially create new ways to develop, deliver and improve the quality and outcomes of health services. Identifying the goals and challenges of collaboration in healthcare is a key factor to drive cutting-edge research in the field.

Telemedicine and telehealth have not only created opportunities to connect to broader populations, for example in rural areas, in order to reduce costs and improve quality, but also have led to novel techniques for collaborative discovery in the biomedical field, fostering interaction among experts, and enabling cost-effective solutions.

However, collaboration in healthcare continues to falter, and is rarely employed in practice. Several constraints exist. There is often a lack of common ground to support shared perception of information and activity awareness during collaboration. Security, privacy, and quality challenges remain largely unresolved. The nature and complexity of healthcare practice require processes that not only leverage tacit strategies, situational knowledge and experiences, but also vary across communities and remain often unaccounted for in the design of collaborative technologies.

This panel discusses, from several points of views, the factors that enhance or hinder collaboration in healthcare.

Discussion will focus on adoption of collaborative technologies in healthcare, the limits and challenges of the current solutions, and possible evolutions of the current organizational models, highlighting how emerging techniques in areas such as big data analytics, cloud computing, security, mobile applications, multimedia data streaming, and user interaction design, could be harnessed to enhance the practice of collaboration in healthcare.

Panelists will share their thoughts and experiences on aspects of collaboration in healthcare in the light of their personal academic or industrial perspectives.

(LNSSI), Washington D.C., USA  Mary.Galvin@LNSSI.com    DEMO ABSTRACT Smart View? enables the data scientist to gain new, deeper insights into entities of interest across ?big? datasets; all without needing to attempt to integrate separate, disparate technologies for data processing, entity resolution, and data enrichment. The product?s fully integrated set of entity resolution capabilities allow organizations to exploit the full breadth of available data. These capabilities include:  ? Creation of comprehensive ?Entity Intelligence? profiles from disparate, heterogeneous and complex datasets. Resultant profiles can be delivered to end users across any number of data presentation, alerting, and/or visualization channels via standards-based APIs.

? Processes for ingesting, profiling and normalizing massive data volumes at the click of a button, while simultaneously taking advantage of a massively parallel Extract, Transform, and Load data management subsystem to perform such operations behind-the-scenes.

? The ability to analyze complex networks of relationships and explore results through innovative, data science-oriented visualizations.

LexisNexis has decades of experience in the entity resolution arena. Scalable Automated Linking Technology (SALT), the highly accurate, fast and flexible technology running behind-the-scenes in prominent corporate applications, is what distinguishes LexisNexis data from that of its competitors. An example of this is LexisNexis? Accurint system, which contains billions of records from 10,000+ sources and has resolved the individuals contained therein to 250 million unique identities. Its users in the law enforcement, employee screening, insurance and banking industries all rely on identity profiles generated through SALT?s entity resolution capability to guide their decision-making process.

The same technology that serves as the secret sauce behind LexisNexis? multi-billion dollar business in the risk sector is now embedded in Smart View? and exposed to the user in such a way that any organization can capitalize on its powerful entity resolution capabilities.

During this demonstration, attendees will see how Smart View?s entity resolution and relationship extraction algorithms have been applied to a variety of datasets in various languages and formats: Twitter profiles, cargo shipping data, international phonebook data, international movie data, etc. Time will be reserved at the end for Q&A from the audience.
