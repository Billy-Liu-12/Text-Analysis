To gain the competitive advantage in today?s age of technology, growing data and to bear the competitive pressure, making strong decisions according to customer?s need and market trend has become very important. With huge amount of data on internet, web data mining has become very significant.

Web Usage helps companies to produce productive information pertaining to the future of their business function ability by analyzing the usage information from their websites. Sequential Patterns allow the collection of web access data for web pages.

This usage data provides the paths leading to accessed web pages and their sequences which can give us valuable information about user?s behavior and effectiveness of websites. The focus of this survey paper is to review the challenges, issues and techniques for finding sequential patterns in the context of web usage mining.

For this, different techniques from the literature have been reviewed.  Analysis of the existing techniques related to the sequential pattern finding has been done on the basis of the existing literature and some parameters are proposed. The comparison criteria for the analysis include Graph Structure, Input Data Structure, Input Parameters, Pattern Type, Application, Technique, Method, Algorithm, Scalability and Tool Support. The reviewed techniques are divided into three groups Clustering; Association; Markov Model based techniques. By analyzing all the techniques with the help of above defined parameters, compare and contrast we finally conclude that the two clustering techniques based on Markov Models (Line Prediction and Path Analysis Using Markov Chains & Using Markov Chains for Structural Link Prediction for Adaptive Web Sites) proposed by Sarukkai  & Zhu et al. respectively, are the best sequential pattern finding techniques. Analyzing different techniques also show that the hybrids of different techniques can be used to find sequential patterns in web usage mining data.

Strength and weaknesses of one technique can complement of the other technique so it is best to use techniques in combination if we want accurate patterns efficiently.

I.  INTRODUCTION Internet has become perhaps the biggest searching tool in  today?s age now. People want to enhance their businesses electronically. However, E-businesses may not just build a web site and then sit back and pick the benefits, which, in most cases, is unrewarding. People have to implement web mining systems to understand their customers' profiles and identify strengths and weaknesses of their E-marketing efforts on the web through continuous improvements [25]. Internet is a gold  mine, but only for those companies who realize the importance of Web mining and adopt a Web mining strategy now [25].

Web Mining is the integration of information collected from the traditional data mining methodologies with information collected over the World Wide Web (WWW). It is used to understand the user?s behavior and evaluate the effectiveness of the web sites. Useful hidden information can be used to discover the visitor?s profile and can also measure online marketing efforts.

Web mining can be divided into three categories; Web Content Mining (WCM), Web Structure Mining (WSM) and Web Usage Mining (WUM). WCM is used to discover useful information from text, graph, audio or video data in the web.

WSM describes the organization of data from web structures, XML or HTML tags. There are two types of WSM, one is intra-structure (hyperlinks with in page) and other is inter- structure (hyperlinks from one page to other page). WUM is the process of finding user?s intention and data from the web logs, for example; IP Address, time and date. It helps to find the search patterns for a particular user?s group [18]. Web Usage Mining (WUM) techniques provide knowledge about the behavior of the users in order to extract relationships in the recorded date. So focus of this paper is on WUM. It is used to find the access patterns from the web. It exposes the usage pattern with cluster mining, association rules mining and sequential pattern mining. According to Jain & Dubes [22], clustering is an unsupervised technique; by using it we can group a given collection of objects into meaningful clusters.

According to Mobasher et al. [23], association rule mining identifies the associations among the dataset, so a subset of transactions implies that presence of other also. These techniques are more frequently used for web usage mining [19]. Martha Koutri et al. define the web usage mining process as given in Figure: 1 [19].

Figure 1: Web Usage Mining Process [19]  Raw Usage Data Preprocessing  Preprocess ed Usage  Data  Pattern Discovery  Usage Patterns  Pattern Analysis  Interesting Patterns,  Rules, Statistics    In this paper, our focus is only on the sequential pattern mining techniques. Agrawal et al. [21], define a problem of finding inter-transaction patterns. Under this context, a pattern is an ordered list of sets of items. In sequential pattern, we identify frequently occurring event sequences (temporal patterns) in the data. This technique is very useful for the identification of navigational patterns. We can discover sequential patterns by using two methods, by using deterministic techniques (recording the navigational behavior of the user) and stochastic methods (use the sequence of web pages that have been visited in order to predict subsequent visits) [20]. We have considered two data sources, web logs and databases. Data is automatically generated and stored in server access logs, referrer logs, agent logs and client side cookies. We are not considering the preprocessing step; we assume that it has done already.

This paper extracts absolute information as stated by the authors of proposed approach and then we analyze it on our extracted parameters. In Section II we explain the main points of all the surveyed techniques individually. In Section III assessment criteria for the analysis of techniques has been defined, in section IV the surveyed techniques are discussed and their analysis has been done based on the identified parameters, and in section V, the survey is concluded. An analysis matrix based on our analysis has been given in Table: I.



II. SURVEYED TECHNIQUES Sequential Pattern techniques can be deterministic  techniques which record the navigational behavior of the user, and stochastic techniques that use the sequence of Web pages that have been visited in order to predict subsequent visits.
