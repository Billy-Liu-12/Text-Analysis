I.  INTRODUCTION  As a hot issue in the field of information systems research, IT outsourcing services draw more and more attention. It has many characteristics such as high cost, long cycle and involving a lot of problems. Its implementation is a more complex process full of risks and many factors affect these risks, which bring much incomplete and uncertain information [1]. In the IT outsourcing service, risk management is an important content and plays a key role in IT outsourcing services project. As a new mathematical method dealing with uncertain, imprecise and incomplete data, a study on Rough set theory has developed from immature to mature since it is widely used in some aspects of machine learning, data mining, knowledge discovery, decision support and analysis, inductive reasoning, expert system and pattern recognition [2]. This paper tries to analyze the main risk factors of the IT outsourcing services by the  theory of Rough set, and establishes an effective risk analysis and statistical table of IT outsourcing and attributes reduction table and risk decision rule table.

Then it will provide a new method for the main risk factors of IT outsourcing service.



II.  ROUGH SET THEORY AND KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION  Polish mathematician Pawlak [3] proposed the Rough set theory in 1982. It can be concluded from the theory, this paper gets the knowledge expression system  ),,,( fVDCUS ?= , which ?U? represents  discourse domain, ?C? represents condition attribute, ?D? represents decision attribute, ?V? represents value range,  :f U A V? ?  represents information function [4].

A? The express of Upper and lower approximation of Rough set  In ),,,( fVDCUS ?= , for each subset X ? U,  and unclear relations ?R? . According to Rough set theory, the scope definition by using Upper and lower approximation representation. Combine with  ?reference  [5-7]? which defined: [ ]{ }( ) x | x RR X U X? = ? ?  as the  lower approximation, [ ]{ }( ) x | x RR X U X ?  = ? ? ? ? as the  upper approximation. To decision rules ? ?? , exist  ( / )s? ? ? = ( ) scard  card U ? ?? , which card? /? represents the  base of? /? . The ( / )s? ? ?  regards as the approximate  accuracy of? /? , then it can can be used to define  Rough set, while 0 ( / ) 1s? ? ?< < , the relationship between  ? / ?  and ?R? is rough, while ( / )s? ? ? =1, the     relationship between ? /?  and ?R? is accuracy.

B? Attribute reduction  Rough set theory given the reduction method of knowledge [8]. It can be concluded from the expression system of knowledge ),,,( fVDCUS ?= , the set of attributes B ? A is equivalent with RB.

1?Set up a?A, if  RA=RA\{a}, then ?a? is called the excess attribute.

2?If there is no excess attributes in the system, then ?a? is called independent.

3? Subset B ? A as ?A? reduction, if RA=RB, and ?B? doesn't have excess attribute, then ?A? as allattribute.

Attribute reduction can be express:  ( ) ( ) ( )bBN x R x R x ?  ? = ?  [9].

C.  decision support and certainly factor and  coverage factor  It can be concluded from ?reference [1, 5]?  about decision support, certainly factor, cover factor:  1) The formula about decision support:  ( , )( , ) ( ) ( )  ss s  card Spt  Card U Card U ? ?? ? ?? ?  ? = =     ?1?  2) The formula about certainly factor: )(  ( , ) ( / ) ( )  s s  s  card Cer  Card ? ?  ? ? ? ? ? ? ?  = =     ?2?  3)The formula about coverage factor: ( )  ( , ) ( / ) ( )  sss s  Card Cov  Card ? ?  ? ? ? ? ? ? ?  = =    ?3?  ?.  ALGORITHM FOR ACQUISITION OF RULES AND APPLICATION BASED ON ROUGH SET  A.  Algorithm for acquisition of rules  According to the theory for acquisition of rules based on Rough set, this paper provide the steps of analysis calculation as follows:  1) The scope definition and attribute reduction of Rough set  2) The calculation of rules decision support 3) The calculation of rules certainly factor 4) The calculation of rules coverage factor  B.  Case analysis  According to questionnaire of investigation, this paper is a statistical analysis of the risk factors of IT outsourcing service. Altogether 300 questionnaires are put out, and 269 questionnaires are taken back. The effective returns-ratio is 89.7%. Through analyzing the overcome of these questionnaires, the successful projects of IT outsourcing service account for 46%, the failed projects of IT outsourcing service account for 54%. After analysis and comparison these questionnaires, this paper chooses knowledge transfer ability, trust degree and risk control ability as major risk factors, applying the method of Rough set, and combining literature to discussion and analysis.
