Abstract? Using heterogeneous clouds has been considered to improve performance of big-data analytics for healthcare platforms. However, the problem of the delay when transferring big-data over the network needs to be addressed. The purpose of this paper is to analyze and compare existing cloud computing environments (PaaS, IaaS) in order to implement middleware services. Understanding the differences and similarities between cloud technologies will help in the interconnection of healthcare platforms. The paper provides a general overview of the techniques and interfaces for cloud computing middleware services, and proposes a cloud architecture for healthcare. Cloud middleware enables heterogeneous devices to act as data sources and to integrate data from other healthcare platforms, but specific APIs need to be developed. Furthermore, security and management problems need to be addressed, given the heterogeneous nature of the communication and computing environment. The present paper fills a gap in the electronic healthcare register literature by providing an overview of cloud computing middleware services and standardized interfaces for the integration with medical devices.

I.  INTRODUCTION Cloud computing technology emerged from the increasing  requirements for a large data storage management system and also for a better performance of existing resources.

Consequently, traditional data-centers were used for storing and managing big volumes of data and are now very important in providing an efficient work load distribution for cloud systems.

A cloud environment offers a platform available for developing complex applications that process data gathered over time from different sources, providing scalability as the requirements and workloads are increasing.

The retrieval and processing of big-data resources across the Web represents a well-known challenge. Cloud computing technologies provide interfaces and processes to access and manage data in the form of web services that can be interconnected between various devices, furthermore providing a way to unify access to heterogeneous data sources also for human users.

The main challenge of current healthcare platforms is the requirement of applications to process big data with a low delay and high throughput for providing near real-time information intelligence to health workers. Cloud computing is offering such fast and elastic resources at the infrastructure level, which  can be extended by adding different platforms or applications as cloud middleware services.

The cloud middleware layer can be developed based on three sub-layers and the specific cloud components implemented as follows: local cloud components on slave sensor nodes, edge cloud components on master gateway nodes and central cloud components on application / datastore server nodes.

Current healthcare platforms require the convergence of computer science and medicine, being an inter-disciplinary domain. Furthermore, these platforms can be used for other areas than providing health care services, such as a training platform for medical students or research platform. The main concern is the processing of big data resulted from medical activities, which is most often un-structured, such as medical imagery or video, but of vital importance for the treatment of patients. One solution to minimize the processing delay and consequently to improve the cure process for patients is to use resilient error-free cloud storage and search based applications for indexing the un-structured data and meta-data.

The main contribution of this paper is the analysis of the existing cloud computing environments and the implementation of a middleware service in order to interconnect a healthcare platform.

The paper has a further organization as follows:  Section II presents the rationale for cloud and Big Data solutions convergence, and then Section III proposes an architecture for the interconnection of a healthcare platform with a cloud environment. Moreover, several other solutions for medical data services in cloud environments are analyzed, taking into account as well the security problem. Section IV concludes the paper with discussions and main findings.



II. RATIONALE FOR CLOUD COMPUTING AND BIG DATA CONVERGENCE FOR INTERCONNECTION OF HEALTHCARE  PLATFORMS  A. Cloud Computing Cloud Computing represents a new paradigm in IT.

Recently, standardisation efforts have resulted in reference frameworks and definitions such as the ones from NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) [1], as cloud computing being a model for a generation of ubiquitous access, for a pool of convenient and on demand computing resources (e.g. storage, network, server processing and memory, platform, application and services), which are made available in real time      via web interfaces with low administration overhead or interaction from a cloud service supplier.

According to NIST, five main characteristics of the concept of Cloud are recorded: technical support on request, broadband network connections, resource pooling, real-time elasticity and services measured as utilities. Furthermore, the organization standardized models for three main services (SaaS, PaaS and IaaS) and four possible developments (private, shared, public and hybrid) that together define the categories of delivering and deploying cloud services.

The definition is a baseline for allowing a reference model that could allow comparison of cloud developments and services, as well as allow discussions and extensions of the basic cloud computing technologies and provide use cases of how it is more convenient to be used [2].

B. Big Data Solutions Currently there are many solutions on the market for search  and analysis of large volumes of information [3], [4]. These solutions are focused on semantic technologies for aggregating and collating data, both structured and unstructured [5]. Besides the well-known Google, there are developed and under development solutions for enterprises and small and medium businesses based on CRM (Customer Relationship Management), ERP/M (Enterprise Resource Planning / Management), and BI (Business Intelligence). Other Big Data solutions that could be mentioned are web applications, such as applications B2B (Business to Business), B2C (Business to Customer), using data from various sources (databases, web content, user generated content, etc.) [6].

Ontopica, a software company that uses the advantages of semantic technologies and the development of ontologies to organize volumes of unstructured data, has released Dito, a software application that provides a platform for online participation and browser-based search [7]. Knime [8] is a platform for performing statistical data analysis and data mining the data for trend analysis and prediction of potential outcomes. RapidMiner [9] combines machine learning, big data mining and analytics using predictive algorithms being used more in research, education, development of applications.



III. PROPOSED CLOUD ARCHITECTURE FOR HEALTHCARE  A. Cloud Storage Architecture The resulting cloud architecture for the interconnection with  a healthcare platform [10] is illustrated in Fig. 1.

Data storage is considered as one of the main building  blocks of the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) layers in the proposed architecture. Located at the intersection between central and local cloud, the cloud middleware is designed to implement home gateway functionality and to ensure the security of user information. The local cloud enables the interconnection with different devices through standardized network protocols and interfaces.

The storage models and cloud services architectures for typical healthcare applications in hospitals requires the archiving of big data resulting from clinical data records that should be accessed by medical decision support systems in real- time and provide alerts and notifications [11].

Edge cloud  Central cloud  Local / Device Cloud  Healthcare Platforms (epSOS, etc.)  Standards and specifications (Continua Health Alliance)  Cloud Middleware  Security  Data Storage    Figure 1.  Healthcare cloud architecture based on 3 sub-layers of cloud middleware  Therefore, the cloud computing technology must provide access to big data storage capacity that has also low latency for accessing the information. Another challenge is the processing of unstructured and heterogeneous medical data such as images or videos, which require specialized hardware. Furthermore, integration of different information systems are required to provide a unified collaboration environment for healthcare workers.

In [13] the authors analyze the problem of metadata that are not interoperable and the vocabularies can be shared only with certain limits between applications that have each their own data warehouses. The challenge for an educational application is presented and solutions and such as linked data standards for sharing and publishing the metadata are proposed.

As a result of the exponential growth of mobile devices that are connected to the Internet, new applications are required from the traditional GSM providers. These applications are ranging from location based services such as notifications to visualization of sensors and controlling of actuators in the context of the emerging IoT (Internet of Things) frameworks.

Sensors transmit large amounts of data that need to be stored and processed in order to extract the required intelligence for providing relevant information to the users.

The provisioning of contextual information is discussed in [14] and a framework is proposed that allows consumers to publish and subscribe to context services that are mediated by context brokers in the cloud. Moreover, it?s described how a novel decision algorithm uses multiple attributes for choosing what services can be aggregated to match the request of the users according to their context. The algorithm calculates the score of each context service, per context information type, based on the quality-of-service (QoS) and quality-of-context information (QoC) requirements expressed by the context consumer.

The cloud advantage of resource scalability is used by the context service providers for adding or reducing cloud nodes according to the variable workload requested by the users.

Besides, the proposed algorithm selects and ranks the context services by matching their QoS and QoC offers against the QoS and QoC requirements of the context consumer.

B. Cloud Services and Architectures Using Cloud Services In [15] it is described a system that integrates image  processing and web services for providing cloud services according to a SOA (service-oriented architecture) model for implementing X-Ray data management. The web service modules have standardized interfaces and can be composed and aggregated for providing cloud services according to the healthcare worker requirements. Therefore, a SaaS model can provide an easy to use web collaborative environment for sharing and communicating between internal and external stakeholders of a healthcare system.

Recently, imaging data can be flexible managed with drag and drop workflow systems that have an increasing impact on current picture archiving and communication system (PACS) [16]. Furthermore, the need for services that offer big data storage as well as fast search and retrieval can be provided much more efficiently by cloud computing solutions than traditional small data center infrastructure. Theoretically, unlimited computing resources are offered by cloud providers such as Amazon, Google or Microsoft in the form of utility pay as you go model. Cloud services can be independent from the cloud provider and the required resilience can be achieved by running instances on two different cloud service providers.

The main challenge of cloud services in the healthcare domain is the management and sharing of onsite medical archives. For example, a current statistic estimates that alone in the US over 1 billion diagnostic procedures will require imaging data of around 100 Petabytes to be stored and processed. Therefore, this big data problem leads to questions regarding the scalability and resilience of current PACS systems.

Cloud computing is envisioned as a solution that will provide the required elasticity, energy efficiency and emergency availability, even in the case of force majeure.

Recent efforts of Microsoft Windows Azure cloud developers have demonstrated a proof of concept for providing an architecture using cloud services for the healthcare applications [17].

C. Medical Data Services in the Cloud Acigna-G [18] represents a project which established a  unified approach between a Cloud and a Grid Computing system based on a GNU/Linux web platform, while trying to avoid the usage of legacy APIs. The cloud service for medical imagery is offered at PaaS level and integrates existing Grid applications.

In [19], Natural Language Processing (NLP) is presented as a solution in the medical field that offers ease of use for medical data services. As a downside, the NLP technology is still under development for many languages and the costs are considered high. The main advantage is represented by the service composition that can be mastered in a flexible way by each healthcare worker according to his needs and profile. Therefore, the NLP processing done as a cloud service can allow medical text data processing in a self-service model.

An example for cloud medical data service is Aspergillus Genomes [20], that offers via a public website the aggregated information about annotated genes sequenced by different projects.

Further innovative multi-domain healthcare services are deployed via Future Internet [21] in a research movement that proposes SDN (Software Defined Network) as a basis of the infrastructure for medical data services in the cloud. To solve the problem of heterogeneous un-standardized data models of the medical records, the data is indexed in their repositories in different hospitals. Furthermore, the approach provides a platform for other research topics related to the healthcare science in the form of tele-medicine interfaces.

Health Information exchange (HIX) [22] features a cloud service approach that can be implemented as a central business platform for managing various activities in a hospital. The services are provided at PaaS and SaaS level and can process all patient-doctor interactions for providing a decision support system.

In [23], a cloud computing implementation is developed for the storage and retrieval of medical image files. Storage area networks or network attached storage systems can provide a resilient data warehouse for the cloud computing system.

Moreover, in [24] a cloud broker solution improves current medical image search system based on the concept of goal which enables users to define required resources and to search for them, thus optimizing the use of resources in the cloud.

D. Security The security of the medical records in electronic form is one  the main concerns as sharing mechanism in the cloud computing platform become more popular and encryption can ensure data confidentiality.

Furthermore, privacy is an increasingly important issue when processing electronic medical records. One of the most important US initiatives in health security is the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA), specifying that the confidential section of the electronic medical record needs to be protected.

Thus, security mechanisms to protect the processing and sharing of medical records of patients is a critical aspect of cloud services for healthcare. Four main categories of privacy protection are available: anonymity, pseudonymity, un- linkability, and un-observability. The research in this field has demonstrated the usability of cross reference tables and mathematical conversions in order to obfuscate the confidential data in electronic health records for fulfilling the required privacy standards [25].

Continua Health Alliance [10] represents an organization that gathers together different companies in healthcare or technical field, aiming to build a cooperation that will improve the healthcare grade. The main purpose of this organization is to allow vendors to develop sensors, home networks or tele- health applications, but also health services. Tele-health applications use the electronic data, but also telecommunications technologies, in order to offer health care, health education, public health and health administration for patients but also for other organizations. In order to offer these services, the organization uses several technologies like videoconference, cloud storage, streaming media, wireless communications, etc.

epSOS [10] represents a platform which is designed to interconnect the EHR (Electronic Health Records) systems in Europe, being based on a service infrastructure which offers      ease of access. The epSOS project is based on a general policy that implies the adoption of international standards, rather that the development of new specific ones. This platform uses mobile inexpensive technologies which are available on a large scale and it also relies on 3G internet connectivity in order to support services such as streaming video or live video chatting.

These methods are difficult to adapt, if there are taken into consideration several mechanisms which are based on the un- linkability and un-observability properties. Thus, improving the un-linkability mechanism between the patient and the electronic medical record is needed. In order to respond to these requirements, technologies such as cloud computing are necessary. Cloud computing is known for its capabilities such as fast computation or large storage space, allowing the integration of electronic medical record system in a hospital, in order to facilitate their exchange, and to provide smaller hospitals or clinics that have fewer resources with adequate electronic medical record storage space.



IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS The authors provided a general overview of cloud  computing for interconnection of healthcare platforms as innovative solution that proposes a new business model, based on an large data storage management system, increasing scalability for infrastructures, software, and also applications.

The architecture presented in this paper aimed to provide a solution that offers cloud computing middleware services in healthcare area. Cloud computing middleware allows the exploitation of several data sources and their integration with various devices providing a way to unify access to heterogeneous data sources also for human users. In this paper there were also addressed security and management problems, given the heterogeneous nature of the communication and computing environment.

The growing data volume produced per examination with medical imagery increases with the demand for 3D visualization of such data sets in radiology.

In order to realize the exchange of medical information, and the efficient health information system, it was proposed a system infrastructure based on the cloud computing and the implementation of a middleware service in order to interconnect a healthcare platform. In this architecture were applied three kinds of application mode, SaaS, PaaS and IaaS.

The different healthcare units could select the corresponding application according to their specific usages, what's more, the existing information systems can access cloud computing environment through federal service platform cloud interface, finally to create the environment for the whole medical and health units to use the cloud computing conveniently by reducing operating costs and improving medical standards.
