Heterogeneous Spacecraft Networks: General Concept and

Abstract- In recent years the Mission Design Center (MDC) at NASA Ames Research Center has been studying mission  concepts involving clusters of small spacecraft capable of  providing cost-effective solutions in orbit compared to space  missions involving only a single larger spacecraft. Low-cost  networks of small spacecraft can be a viable alternative to  large budget Earth observation or space exploration missions  producing significant scientific return for often moderate  development efforts and short lead times. This paper is the  first in a series of 3 companion papers in which we make the point that the scientific value (and hence the cost effectiveness)  of small multi-spacecraft missions can be further increased if  the network of spacecraft is allowed to be heterogeneous. We  define Heterogeneous Spacecraft Networks (HSNs) to be  networks of spacecraft having different operators or  originating from different missions that are able to  communicate with each other in a low-cost manner and with  low impact on overall system resources. HSN incorporates  both the space segment and ground segment for an end-to-end  solution. In this contribution we illustrate the strength of the  HSN approach by presenting a general concept for a HSN in  LEO as well as a case study showcasing the value of such a  network. In particular, we present a case study where we  examine the feasibility of a low-cost, multi-institutional  network of small spacecraft acting as a next-generation Earth  Observation (EO) platform and focusing on ad-hoc data relay  to maximize throughput. In the simulation we show that the  downlink throughput of an HSN can be larger by an order of  magnitude compared to the conventional scenario where no  networking capability exists. Other benefits of using a HSN as  a next-generation increment of existing capabilities include  increased revisit frequencies as well as the ability to collect  correlated data simultaneously from distributed locations  around the globe using either conventional or fractionated  spacecraft. We list key performance requirements for a HSN in  order to produce a desirable scientific return and present a  concept of operations (ConOps) for the practical  implementation. In the ConOps we discuss the required  performance of the inter-satellite and space-to-ground links  and give an overview of the associated ground station network.

We give an overview of the network management techniques  required to operate and control the network on a day-to-day   Gokul Bhat, Janise McNair Wireless and Mobile (W AM) Systems  Lab, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of  Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611, gbhat@utl.edu,  mcnair@ece.utl.edu  basis and address the issues of network configuration, network  discovery and security, as well as fault and performance  management. The paper ends with an outlook on the paradigm  shift HSNs may introduce in the domain of space operations.

We also list a number of promising applications making use of  the strength of the concept.

A popular approach to achieve this is to fly small spacecraft with low or medium performance instrwnents whenever large and sophisticated instruments are not strictly necessary for mission success. This trend has been made possible through the results recently achieved in the miniaturization of technology along with the serial production of small spacecraft platforms and the availability of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and consumer electronics for space missions. Evidence supporting the evolution can be found in the large number of low-cost small spacecraft missions that have been launched in recent years. However, it should be noted that the savings in development costs achieved by using smaller spacecraft do not come for free. The savings are typically associated with a perceptible decline in the scientific return of the mission.

A means to address the moderate scientific return of small spacecraft missions is to take advantage of the scalability of the design process of small spacecraft. Although small spacecraft will not replace their larger counterparts in the foreseeable future, it is usually acknowledged that small spacecraft missions involving multiple units are a promising way to achieve considerable scientific value at low cost. An example of this is the Edison Demonstration of Smallsat Networks (EDSN) mission currently developed by NASA Ames Research Center and slated for launch in 20 14. The goal of EDSN is to demonstrate a swarm of small inexpensive satellites with novel on-orbit communication? capabilities and their suitability to act as a future platform for distributed space weather measurements [ 1 ] . The cost of the overall EDSN project is between $ 1 0 and $ 20 million for a mission lifetime of 24 months.

Although the cost of missions such as EDSN is comparatively low, it remains to be seen if such missions are the fmal answer to the question of cost-effectiveness.

Can cost-effectiveness be increased further? This paper is the first in a series of three companion papers that attempts to answer this question to the affirmative. Cost-effectiveness can  .

be increased further provided that disruptive changes  are mtroduced to the way how space missions are conducted today. We argue that the concept of Heterogeneous Spacecraft Networks (HSNs), loosely defined as being multi-institutional networks of spacecraft able to communicate with each other in a low-cost manner, is one means to achieve this objective.

2. P APER ORGANIZATION  The focus of this paper lies on the general presentation of the H?N concept. In Section 3 we present a general concept overvIew for heterogeneous spacecraft networks. In Section 4 we then proceed with a Concept of Operations (ConOps) for a HSN of small spacecraft in LEO and a summary of the main issues related to the Network Management (NM) of such HSNs is given in Section 5. A case study showcasing the benefits of a heterogeneous mission architecture for Earth Observation in LEO is shown in Section 6. We conclude in Section 7 and discuss our work in Section 8.

Clearly, the key technology area to address is space communications. Details regarding the trades involved in the selection of the appropriate HSN communications hardware are presented in the two companion papers [2] [3 ] , hereafter named Paper 2 and Paper 3 ,  respectively. The concept presented in the present work builds on the findings obtained in these papers.

3. GENERAL HSN CONCEPT  Heterogeneous Spacecraft Networks  The Mission Design Center (MDC) at NASA Ames Research Center is currently investigating if spacecraft that are procured, built, launched and operated by different multi-institutional players can be integrated into a single network for various common mission objectives. The idea is to have each institution procure one or several spacecraft in the conventional way but with the hardware necessary to become a member of a large in-orbit cloud of multi? institutional spacecraft. Each spacecraft may be different in design and may be part of a different mission. However, all of the spacecraft have the possibility to join the cloud w?enever desired and work towards a common objective WIth the other units defining the network. As such one may speak of a network of spacecraft that is truly heterogeneous in nature since both the origin of the nodes making up the netw?rk and the mission on which the nodes are flying may be dIfferent. The purpose for which the network is estab?ished varies on a case by case basis. The single system defmmg the network is the communications architecture which ensures both efficient space-to-ground (S-G) and space-to-space (S-S) communication between all the space and ground nodes involved. The key features of what we call a Heterogeneous Spacecraft Network (HSN) are defined in Table 1 .  The Table compares this features to the ones of conventional (or homogeneous) spacecraft networks such as EDSN.

Conventional  (homogeneous) spacecraft  networks  Single institution: spacecraft all procured by the same institution and built by the same manufacturer  Single operator: all operated by operator using ground segment  spacecraft the same a single  Single mISSIon: spacecraft all part of the same mission  Heterogeneous Spacecraft  Networks (HSNs)  Multi-institutional : spacecraft procured by different institutions and possibly built by different manufacturers  Multiple operators : not all spacecraft are operated by the same operator. The ground segments used are different.

Possibly multiple mISSIOns implying various degrees of mission criticality of the HSN. The spacecraft making up the HSN may be part of different missions and the mission criticality of the HSN may therefore differ from one spacecraft to the next (see also Table 2)    National endeavor  Spacecraft built using the same technology and components  Dedicated communications hardware with often proprietary network protocol suite.

Can be a multi-national project  Technology and components may differ significantly between spacecraft  COTS technology to enable HSN communication. All is based on open standards  Table 1: Key features of a Heterogeneous Spacecraft  Network (HSN) as opposed to a conventional spacecraft  network (such as e.g., EDSN).

Taxonomy  As mentioned in the previous paragraph, one of the defming elements of a HSN is that the spacecraft making up the network may or may not originate from different missions.

From this observation it follows naturally that the criticality of the HSN to meet the mission objectives of all or part of the nodes can be different across the network. It is therefore useful to differentiate between the different situations in which an HSN may be set up in practice. In what follows we provide a brief overview of applications in which it may be interesting to establish a HSN. We classify these applications according to the level of criticality of the network to meet the various mission objectives of the individual nodes.

For instance, the HSN may be the defming element of a single space mission only, in which all the different institutions providing the nodes have taken part in the definition of the network objectives prior to launch.

Institutions have agreed on the establishment of the HSN a priori in order to meet their common objectives. The HSN is in this case a key element of the mission and a requirement for mission success. The purpose for setting up the HSN is identical to the mission objective of each node.

A practical example of this is a mission aiming to set up a dedicated next-generation Earth Observation (EO) platform.

A large number of spacecraft is launched in a broad range of predetermined orbits to perform distributed measurements with the objective to obtain globally correlated data. Each node of the HSN collects data for the same mission and the HSN is used to maximize the benefits for each institution involved in the project. This type of HSN is denominated in what follows a "primary HSN". Other applications of primary HSNs range from low-cost EO missions for small spacecraft up to elaborated concepts for exploration such as large swarms of fractionated spacecraft on an expedition through the solar system.

On the other hand, one may also have the situation in which the HSN is not required at all to guarantee mission success   of any of the nodes involved in the network. The mission objectives of all of the nodes cannot be brought directly into relation with the purpose for which the HSN has been set up. No planning to set up a network has been carried out prior to launch and the HSN is set up in orbit impromptu.

The HSN is in that case an auxiliary asset and its purpose is merely to complement or augment an independent and already existing capability. We call this type of HSN a "secondary HSN". A possible application for such HSNs may be added value data exchange between operators of different space missions. For example, HSNs may provide a simple and low-cost opportunity to augment existing space situational awareness (SSA). Spacecraft originating from various operators and missions have the possibility to exchange their orbital data on a voluntary basis through a common communications architecture. Publicly available data is produced that may be valuable for space traffic management as well as collision assessment and avoidance.

Another application of secondary HSNs, closely related to the above-mentioned idea of voluntary data exchange, is the powerful idea of voluntary data relay or file sharing. It is not impossible to build a platform in space centered around protocols such as BitTorrent supporting the practice of peer? to-peer file sharing and the distribution large amounts of data. We get back to the notion of voluntary data relay in Section 6 where we present the results of a fust simulation carried out to quantify the performance of ad-hoc data relay made possible by an HSN of small spacecraft.

Finally, there are various situations in between where the HSN is neither of primary nor of secondary type. Such architectures, in which the HSN is critical to the mission objective of part of the nodes but not all , are labeled to be "hybrid HSNs". Some nodes have an independent primary mission in addition to their role in the network, others do not and their purpose in orbit is exclusively to increase the performance of the network. Again, a straightforward example of an application for a hybrid HSN is data relay.

However, now some spacecraft act as pure data relay nodes that have been launched specifically for that purpose. Other nodes have not been designed primarily to be part of a HSN and have been furbished with the HSN communications hardware just to be equipped should a data relay opportunity arise at later times during mission lifetime. The probe nodes perform their mission specific measurements and forward the data to the relay nodes. A case study focusing on a hybrid HSN used for Earthquake precursor event monitoring is shown in Paper 2. In the long term, possible applications may include interplanetary data relay as well as the vision of the interplanetary Internet [4] .  Our categorization of HSNs is summarized in Table 2.

Type of HSN  Primary HSN  Characteristics Possible  Applications  The network is of Dedicated EO critical importance platform for mission success.

All s ace craft fly on    the same mission and the establishment of the HSN is required for mission success.

All the nodes making up the HSN have been launched to meet the same mission objectives.

The network is not of critical importance to any of the nodes. All spacecraft fly on different missions and the HSN is not a critical element of any of these missions. Each node making up the network is part of a mission that cannot be directly brought into relation with the purpose for which the HSN has been set up.

The network IS critical to the mission success of part of the nodes. The other nodes have an independent primary mission that does not necessarily require the HSN to meet its objectives.

HSN Mission Architectures  The purpose of a heterogeneous spacecraft network is to enable low-cost space-to-space (S-S) and space-to-ground (S-G) communication across spacecraft from different institutions, manufacturers, operators or missions. Figure I shows a conceptual sketch of this situation. Note that the picture does not represent a particular architecture for a given mission scenario. The idea behind the sketch is rather to visualize the concept of HSN in its most general form. N independent missions are shown each of which is marked by a different color. Each mission is made up of a space segment comprising one or more spacecraft and a ground segment comprising a set of ground stations, a Mission Operations Center (MOC) and a Data User Community (DUC). Within each mission the different spacecraft may be procured by different institutions and built by different manufacturers. This additional potential variety in spacecraft origin within each mission is highlighted by the use of different colors to outline the icons depicting a spacecraft.

The particular case where N=l in Figure 1 refers to what has been called earlier a primary HSN. There is only one space mission and the heterogeneity of the network stems solely from the fact that the spacecraft haven been procured, built and launched by different institutions. Secondary and hybrid HSNs provide the additional complexity of being composed of spacecraft originating from different missions.

They are operated by different MOCs and have different data user communities as customers. The case where N> 1 in Figure 1 represents the architecture of this type of HSNs.

Clearly, the operations related to secondary and hybrid HSNs are not trivial. Recall that in classical space operations without HSNs the operations of each of the N missions are independent and do not interfere with each other. The spacecraft are operated by the respective MOC in charge of Telemetry, Tracking and Command (TT&C) and transfer of mission data to the respective DUC. For secondary and hybrid HSN this simple picture is not valid any more due to the heterogeneity of the nodes. No single MOC is in a position to oversee and manage the complex operations associated with the entire network'. The most prominent reason for this is the lack of knowledge each MOC has about the internals of the other N- l missions. For example, typically no MOC disposes of the ground station schedule of spacecraft other than its own.

The solution we propose to manage the operations of secondary and hybrid HSNs is to install a comprehensive Network Management Architecture (NMA). The NMA is depicted in Figure 1 as an additional layer between the MOCs and the DUCs and takes care of any activity related to the management of the network. We get back to the topic  I Nor does any MOe have the incentive to do so.

of network management in Section 5 where we present an example of an NMA for a secondary HSN of small spacecraft in LEO.

HSN communications solution  The appeal of the HSN concept depends on the performance and the robustness of the communications solution. The ability of the nodes to connect to each other on a plug and play basis and to perfonn seamless S-S and S-G communication is at the heart of the concept and constitues the backbone of the HSN architecture illustrated by Figure l.

Since the goal of HSNs is to leverage the interest of the global space community and to set the framework for the broadest participation possible, the design of the communications solution must be suitable to a large set of different spacecraft platforms. Also special attention must be paid to the limitations of small spacecraft platforms since small spacecraft are probably the most appropriate means to field the first HSN demonstration missions.

This requirement for the communications system to be low? cost, compatible with a broad range of different platforms, not demanding in tenns of spacecraft SWaP resources(Size, Weight and Power), and accessible to a broad range of multi-institutional players drives the design solution away from conventional space communications technology which comes at significant cost and often favors proprietary technology not open to the broad public. Instead, a more versatile solution must be preferred based on publicly available technology and existing international standards in order to facilitate interoperability.

A number of authors have advocated the advantages of using existing Commerciall-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) communications technology in space based on the successful track record such technology has on ground (see [5] and references therein). In this work we argue in a similar direction. In Paper 3 we have performed a trade study on the various networking technologies that are popular on ground today such as WiFi, WCDMA, IEEE 802. 1 5.4 and ZigBee. Perfonnance indicators and figures of merit have been derived in order to identify which technology is suitable for HSN operations in space. The [mdings of Paper 1 are corroborated in our Paper 2 through numerical simulations. We have put emphasis on the particular case of small spacecraft in LEO and quantify the performance of one of the most popular candidate technologies to enable HSNs, namely WiFi.

In what follows we build on these findings and concentrate on HSNs of small spacecraft in LEO using WiFi (see also Table 3). We focus on Low-Earth Orbit since this is the most likely environment in which the advantages of HSNs may be demonstrated in the near future. In the next Section we therefore present a Concept of Operations for a HSN in LEO for the application of EO.

4. CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS FOR A HSN OF  SMALL SPACECRAFT IN LEO  In Paper 2 it has been shown that the communication range of WiFi technology can be extended to 3 1 00 km for S-G links2 and 550 km for S-S links provided some basic assumptions on the characteristics of the ground and space nodes are valid. We here use this finding to design a Concept of Operations (ConOps) for an EO HSN in LEO.

The purpose of the HSN is to have a voluntary ad-hoc data relay capability between each spacecraft participating in the network3. We take N independent EO missions each of which has its own internal mission objectives and its proper mission data to be transferred to Earth. Each mission is made up of one small spacecraft, one ground station, one MOC and one data user community (see Figure 1 ). In what follows we address the challenges to overcome to connect these missions into a data relay network. The purpose of the network is to have every mission benefit from an increased volume of mission data that can be down I inked to Earth.

Mission elements  The proposed architecture is based on the technical [mdings reported in Papers 2 and 3. We refer to these papers for more detail on the trades related to the design presented below.

. ? <I>  Figure 2: HSN consisting of N independent mIssIons  each of which is made up of 1 6U cubesat, 1 ground  station, 1 MOC and 1 data user community. The  standard used for communication is 802.11 (WiFi).

Spacecraft-The HSN communications hardware is designed to suit typical small spacecraft missions, in particular microsatellite and cubesat missions. In the present  2 A slant range of 31 00 km at spacecraft rising above the horizon translated to a spacecraft altitude of 720 km at zenith.

As such the HSN can be classified as a secondary HSN according to  Table 2.

ConOps all the required hardware can be flown on a cubesat with a 6U form factor. We assume the spacecraft has two transceivers. The first is a conventional cubesat transceiver  Frequency Modulation EIRP Standard data rate HSN data rate  2.4 GHz FHSS or DSSS 1 W FCC limitation Up to 54 mbps 256 kb s 3 1 00 km range  Table 3: The IEEE 802.11 standard (WiFi).

in S-band acting as the primary communications device for each mission. Its use is straightforward and operations are not examined in more detail in this work. The second transceiver is based on WiFi technology. This transceiver has been mounted on the spacecraft as an additional low? cost communications capability enabling ad-hoc communication between individual missions whenever an opportunity arises. Key characteristics of the spacecraft platform are given in Table 4. Note that the WiFi transmitter must have a power equal or larger than lOW peak to perform S-G and S-S links at ranges of 3 1 00 km and 550 km respectively. An ADCS capability is needed for each spacecraft to ensure reliable S-S links can be performed with a IOdBi onboard antenna.

Ground stations-Ground stations suitable for the concept range from university ground stations to large ground systems used for high-end missions. In this work, focus is put on small spacecraft ground stations that can be built and operated in an academic setting. Key features are given in Table 5. The upper limit of 30  dBm for the antenna transmitting power is dictated by current WiFi transmitter hardware limitations.

It is assumed that each mission has a ground station that can dedicate a significant amount of its schedule to the mission and the additional passes due to other members of the HSN.

The augmented downlink capability enabled through the HSN can only be achieved if the ground station is available   to service each spacecraft that is part of the network. This may not always be possible. We discuss the roles of ground stations further in the Scheduling subsection below.

MOCs- The MOCs are the centers from which each individual mission is operated. The MOC is the single authority in control of the mission and is ultimately responsible for mission success. The setting up of an HSN does not alter the role and responsibilities of the MOCs. The HSN is a network that can be joined and left on a voluntary basis and the MOC remains in charge of its mission internal assets at all times. All decision-making remains under the auspices of the MOCs. The Network Management Architecture (NMA) is a hub for the coordination of network resources between the MOCs and acts as a monitor and facilitator for an efficient and fair utilization of the HSN.

Data User Communities-The Data User Communities (DUCs) are the final customers to be serviced by each mission. The purpose of establishing a HSN is to increase the customer satisfaction of the DUCs. The scientific value    of each mission, as measured amongst others by the amount of data received by each DUC, is to be increased.

Network topology  Wireless communications standards support different connection topologies. An overview of the topologies can be found in Paper 3. They typically progress from point-to? point, to star and then tree type topologies. Conventional RF space communication links conform to the point-to-point model, that is, from a single spacecraft to the ground station, or from one spacecraft to another. WiFi, however, can be used either in ad-hoc or in infrastructure topology. WiFi in ad-hoc mode is an example of point-to-point networks.

WiFi operating in infrastructure mode is an example of a star configuration, with a so-called access point acting as the central point of the star. All wireless access is mediated and coordinated by the access point. All client nodes must see the access point in order to participate in the subnet. Note that actual data transfer between clients is done directly, not through the access point.

WiFi uses the ssm to identify the network and devices with the same SSID either connect to the access point (infrastructure mode) or use ad-hoc mode to setup direct connections with each other. A beacon packet is used for coordinating the network, periodically determining network membership and assigning time slots for better utilization of the medium. All data transfers are direct from source to destination, with the access point only coordinating the transfers. To have WiFi work properly, it is essential that all the nodes of the network receive and respond to the beacons from the access point.

The WiFi topologies are thus either a star network or a collection of ad-hoc point-to-point links. WiFi can support space-to-space links using ad-hoc mode. If the ground station is an access point in infrastructure mode, the ground station is the central node of the star.

Strategy-Which network topology is best for the ConOps at hand? In the most general case, the choice of the most suitable topology depends on the desired mission configuration, the exact number of satellites and ground stations to be part of the network, the average separation between the spacecraft and the amount of data throughput aimed for. Point to point is the only solution for most simple missions where there are simply not enough nodes to create any other type of network. Star topology is best for networks where a central node, often the ground station desires to communicate with multiple spacecraft located in close proximity, like a closely coupled cluster of satellites.

To keep things simple, we have used WiFi in ad-hoc mode in the simulation shown at the end of this paper. In the future we plan to run the simulation in infrastructure mode as well. Clearly, the final goal of such studies would be to develop an operational strategy that chooses dynamically between the two modes whenever appropriate. The   development and implementation of the optimal strategy is a task that needs to be addressed by the NMA.

Scheduling and Activity Planning  Scheduling-Clearly, one of the main challenges related to efficient utilization of the network is scheduling. The challenge is to determine the dates of all the passes of each spacecraft, not only for the mission internal ground stations (as would have been the case in conventional mission operations without HSN) but for all the ground stations that are part of the network. Furthermore, in order to allow S-S communication, the scheduling algorithm also needs to predict the visibility conditions between all the available space nodes.

The problem of scheduling cannot be addressed by a single MOC because no one MOC possesses all the information required to do the computations. For instance, it cannot be assumed that each MOC has access to the most recent information about the orbital position of a spacecraft other than its own. Furthermore, the appeal of the HSN concept relies heavily on the ability to use the network in a seamless manner. No MOC should be faced with the additional burden of computing schedules for assets that are not their own.

The task of scheduling communication opportunities within the network should be performed by the NMA. A dedicated scheduling algorithm needs to be set up by the network manager for that purpose.

Activity Planning-Activity planning comprises the planning and execution of the commands needed to perform the link within a given communications window. As mentioned earlier, we advocate to retain commanding authority under the exclusive responsibility of the MOe. It pertains to the MOCs to decide whether scheduled communication opportunities are seized or not. Decisions regarding their assets must remain under the auspices of the MOe.

Data policy  Data policy and data management is another important aspect of any operational concept related to HSNs. We give an overview of the main challenges and a number of recommendations how these challenges could be addressed.

Data types-Within each mission there are two types of data: housekeeping and mission data. Should both types of data be transferred through the HSN or not? We answer this question to the negative, mainly because housekeeping data is of interest to the MOCs only and is not a quantity the throughput of which needs to be increased. Focus is on maximizing the throughput of mission data. This is why we recommend the HSN should be used for relaying this type of data only.

Data delivery to the end user-The mission data needs to be provided to the DUCs in a seamless way. However, the    routing to the end user differs from the conventional case where no HSN is present since MOCs now receive data that does not belong to their own mission. Data delivery to the appropriate DUC can be performed through the Internet using a secure file transfer protocol. This is one of the tasks managed by the NMA presented in Section 6.

Data security-Three layers of data security are provided by the WiFi standard. They are encoded in different layers of the OSI stack providing different range of services.

? Application layer: a log-in based authentication  o ensures controlled and authorized access to different applications, and users can be  prevented access depending on their clearance  to use a particular application;  o helps in maintaining a database of all active and passive users to monitor the usage pattern  of the application.

? Network layer: Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)  provide data privacy in the network layer. VPN allows  only authorized users to access a particular network.

VPN furthermore helps in accessing a remote network  from a local machine thus increasing the accessibility of  a network.

? MAC layer: Management of the SSID names can help configure dynamic networks with multiple members.

The MAC layer supports secure authentication and link  encryption by exchanging keys upon association. For  infrastructure mode, the device requests association  using a given SSID, the access point allows association  if the ssm matches its own ssm, then can proceed to  authentication, where passwords and encryption keys  are exchanged and checked. Security at the MAC layer  thus provides data encryption to guarantee data  integrity from sender to receiver and relies on:  o Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is an encryption protocol that offers network  security; or  o WiFi Protected Access (WP A and WP A 2) is the enhanced encryption protocol after WEP  based on the IEEE 802. 1 1  i security standard.

The first version uses public key encryption  concepts. The second version uses the  Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)  identified by the 128-bit private key used. The  AES is considered to be highly advanced and  difficult to break.

The needs in data security vary from mission to mission and it is clear that the security precautions encoded within the WiFi standard do not suit all potential customers of space applications. It is likely that certain users will not be in favor of joining a HSN that is based on an open standard   and ultimately the choice of the appropriate communications technology must match the security requirements of the network. In the case study presented in this paper the network is made up of small spacecraft missions that are low-cost and for which security requirements are supposed to be low. We argue that the security provisions of the 802. 1 1  standard are sufficient for a broad range of missions.

5. NETWORK MANAGEMENT  Needs, Objectives and Challenges  There is a need for centralized coordination between the nodes making up the HSN. This task is carried out by the HSN Network Management Architecture (NMA) as shown in Figure 2. The purpose of the NMA is to act as a supplementary layer between the MOCs and the DUCs in order to facilitate the networking between the various missions. Following needs are to be covered:  Discovery, authentication, registration, and network separation -An overarching end-to-end architecture is needed to enable the establishment of the network and to facilitate the networking between nodes. Nodes need to be monitored and coordinated from network discovery until end of the connection.

Scheduling-A unique schedule of passes needs to be constructed for all the nodes involved in the network. One should ensure the obtained table of passes is fair and maximizes network efficiency. Each mission has to profit to the same extent from the added value of the HSN.

Coordination of activity planning-Based on the HSN schedule, there is a need for a consultative body that informs the MOCs on upcoming opportunities for communication.

One should ensure all the necessary information on upcoming passes is delivered in a timely way to all the participants of the pass. The NMA should act as a facilitating body. The decision-making to use the pass must remain under the authority of the MOCs.

Minimizing operational costs-The NMA needs to ensure the HSN can be used in a seamless manner by all the MOCs involved. No additional resources in terms of manpower and infrastructure should be required from the MOCs.

Data management-The needs for data security and reliable delivery to the DUCs are to be met.

Monitoring and assistance for decision-making-The NMA should monitor the internal functioning of the HSN and report relevant statistics on the activity of each node.

Monitoring should be both passive and active. If required, the NMA should provide information to facilitate the decision-making of the MOCs regarding upcoming communication opportunities. Monitoring network resources may be especially important when it comes to    improving the performance of the H .

As network bandwidth is likely to be scarce, the WIFI devices should run in the mode permitting the highest throughput efficiency. Furthermore, minimal control messages must be utilized to ensure that the spacecraft taking part in the HSN do not suffer from degraded performance. Configuration management (infrastructure vs ad-hoc mode) and fault management are key topics to be addressed. Research efforts focusing on these topics building on the concept of mobile agents (see e.g. , [6]) are currently under development at the MDC.

Table 6: Challenges related to the network management  of a HSN of small spacecraft for EO in LEO.

Implementation  There are a number of ways to accommodate the needs reported above without significant investment in p?ysi  .

cal  infrastructure. For instance, a secure web applIcatIOn dedicated to the management of the HSN serves most if not all the needs. The HSN application would be accessible by each MOC through authentication using a unique HSN user name and password. The application would act as a monitor, coordinator and facilitator of the HSN. The network managers are located at a university and take charge of the maintenance of the application and the overall management of the HSN.

In this scenario, the MOCs would populate a HSN specific database with all the information required to make the network work. This is done on a voluntary basis and it is possible to retreat from the network at all time?. ?he application computes the schedule for communicatIOn opportunities in a dynamical way, informs the MOCs about the opportunities, acts as a consultative and facilitating b?dy between the MOCs and provides all the assistance reqUIred to make the HSN function, up to the delivery of the data to the end users.

Dedicated research needs to be carried out to identify the optimal model to use for HSN network m?nagemen.

t. The focus of this paper is not to present a detaIled solutIOn on this topic, but rather to provide evidence that the establishment of such a multi-institutional NMA for HSNs is a possible and a viable endeavor. The exact role  .

and  responsibility of the NMA clearly needs to be clanfied further.

6. Case Study: Ad-hoc Data Relay in LEO  Simulation  What would be possible if future cubesats were equipped with a WiFi transceiver? To obtain a rough idea of the impact, we performed a simple simulation to quantify the downlink throughput that can be achieved with the HSN presented in Sections 4 and 5. We ask about the t?oughput that can be achieved with a secondary HSN establIshed for the purpose of voluntary data relay. To do this, we use the commercially available Systems Toolkit (STK) software to compute the orbital dynamics of the different spacecraft. We then feed that data to the open source ns-3 network simulator to determine the performance of the network in    terms of data throughput. The method is described in more detail in Paper 2.

The simulation is made up of 63 Earth Observation missions. Each mission is made up of a 6U cubesat, a ground station, a MOC and a DUC as described in Section 4. The spacecraft are put on various orbits commonly used for EO missions. We have chosen 63 orbits belonging to spacecraft currently evolving in LEO. This way, a representative sample of the current population of EO spacecraft could be obtained thereby providing a certain statistical significance to the result. Note that no fme-tuning has been performed to optimize the orbits in order to maximize data throughput.

Figure 4: Simulation of a HSN Earth Observation  platform in LEO made up of small spacecraft. The  simulation is made up of 63 6U cubesats and the chosen  orbits are those of existing EO spacecraft in LEO.

Figure 4 shows a picture of the initial setup. The image shows the 63 cubesats on their respective orbit prior to running the simulation. The downlink throughput is then calculated for three different runs, labeled 'No HSN', 'Partial HSN' and 'Full HSN', and described in more detail  1 1  in Table 7. The three scenarios are run for 1 day using the initial parameters of Table 8. The results are shown in Table 9.

3.45 4.28 34.88  Table 9: Downlink volume per day obtained for the  simulation shown in Figure 4.

The total downlink throughput obtained in run #1 is 3 .45 GB/day. This result confirms our baseline assumption that a WiFi transceiver can effectively be used as a communication device between a ground station and a spacecraft in LEO. Per spacecraft the throughput is equivalent to about 55 MB/day and to about 12. 1 6  MB/pass.

Considering that the downlink rate used is 128  kbps, the expected theoretical throughput per pass is 128/8/ 1 000*12*60=1 1 .52 MB. This theoretical value is in good agreement with the result obtained in the simulation.

Run #2 shows that only moderate improvement is obtained when including the S-S link capability of the HSN. A downlink volume of 4.28 GB is obtained, i.e. 0.83 GB more than in the case where each mission operates without S-S links. This result is a direct consequence of the fact that the simulation has been performed without optimizing the orbits of the spacecraft with respect to each other in order to maximize throughput.

For run #3 we obtain a downlink volume of 34.88  GB. This is an order of magnitude more than in run # 1 where no HSN has been used. When using the S-G capability of the HSN, the amount of data transferred to Earth rises from 55MB to 0.5 GB per day for each cubesat. Note that the increase is mainly due to the ability of the network to use the ground stations of all the missions involved. The throughput would have been even higher if the orbits of the different nodes had been fine-tuned with respect to each other. It is also worth mentioning that only one ground station per mission has been used in the current simulation. The concept of the presented HSN is built around the utilization of low-cost university-class ground stations. It is therefore not impossible to envision a ConOps including more than 63 ground stations.

In summary, the result obtained is rather encouraging. HSNs may be an interesting option to enhance the throughput capability of next-generation small spacecraft EO platforms.

In a simple simulation set up without any optimization of orbits we have provided evidence that a WiFi transceiver can effectively be used as S-G communication hardware and that a significant increase in data volwne can be achieved if the advantages of a networked environment in space are harnessed.

Further simulations need to be done to be more conclusive.

Clearly, throughput volumes larger than the ones shown in Table 9 can be achieved if one equips the cubesats with advanced S-band, C-band or other high performance transceivers. However, the use of these devices has shown to have inconveniences as well, especially in relation with the SWaP limitations of current small spacecraft platforms.

In addition to this,  they are not the most cost-effective solution when it comes to maximizing downlink throughput.

Cost-effectiveness  Each institution that provided a node to the network in our simulation increased its throughput of mission data by an order of magnitude for virtually no additional cost.

Cost effectiveness is certainly the main advantage of using an HSN. Depending on the purpose of the network, the up front costs associated to the setting up of the required NMA range from low to moderate. As mentioned earlier, for low-profile HSNs a NMA developed and operated by students in a university laboratory is probably sufficient. For more advanced HSNs, the cost of the required management architecture is still expected to be relatively low compared to the potential benefits of the network. Once the NMA is set up, recurring costs during mission operations are limited if not negligible. It remains up to each MOC to decide to what extent to take advantage of the network. Each MOC has the possibility to adapt network usage according to existing internal resources and budgetary constraints.

Another aspect likely to impact the cost-effectiveness of the network in a positive way is the possibility to join the network at all times. Institutions initially not interested in joining the project may change their position at a later time and provide additional capability. Mission lifetime, today a limiting factor for space missions, would also benefit from a design that is heterogeneous in nature. The cloud of spacecraft in orbit can be refurbished at all times with new units originating from those institutions with the highest vested interest in extending the lifetime of the network.

The simulation carried out in this paper is the first in a series of simulations we plan to undertake to investigate the true cost-effectiveness of HSNs. In this first simulation, no effort has been put into optimizing the quality of the data that can be collected using the network. From a mission designers' perspective there is room for improvement, especially with regards to the distribution of the network nodes around the   globe. The frequency of  revisit times over particular spots of interest can be increased. Likewise, one may take advantage of the ability of the network to collect a vast amount of correlated measurements from different locations around the globe4. In this paper cost-effectiveness has only been investigated from the aspect of downlink volume and not with regard to the intrinsic scientific merit of the network. It is our belief that a carefully designed primary HSN, as defined earlier in this paper, would have improved the cost? effectiveness of the presented EO platform substantially.

Due to reasons of time, a simulation involving a primary HSN could not be presented in this paper. Future work will concentrate on this however.

7. CONCLUSION  In this paper we presented Heterogeneous Spacecraft Networks (HSNs) as a promising concept for multi? institutional and multi-national networking between spacecraft of different origins. We presented the different types of HSNs one may encounter in practice and have mentioned a number of possible applications. A tentative Concept of Operations has been presented for a secondary HSN of small spacecraft in LEO using WiFi with the purpose of augmented downlink capability for each node participating in the network. Evidence regarding the benefit of such a HSN has been provided by showing that the downlink throughput of each mission is augmented by an order of magnitude compared to the situation where the WiFi transceiver is used in the conventional way for downlink (or, any other transceiver with a rate of 128  kbps).

The main advantage of HSNs is cost-effectiveness achieved through broader participation. The required funding is reduced compared to the case where a single institution ventures to build, launch and operate a network of spacecraft on its own. In the case where funding is widely available across institutions, the value of the network can be increased by launching a larger number of nodes.

Due to this capability of the HSN to collect distributed measurements, the  cost-effectiveness of the network can be brought into relation with the cost?  effectiveness of established Earth Observation platforms such as NASA' s A-Train. The A-Train has a data downlink volume of about 200 GB per day but no significant capability to collect distributed measurements. The  cost of one of the spacecraft making up the A-Train is typically around 200 million USD. In contrast, the HSN presented here has a data downlink  volume of only 34.88 GB per day, but instead has the capability to act as a distributed platform. The cost of one spacecraft is also significantly less than 200 million USD, with overall costs being shared between mUltiple institutions. It is difficult, however, to compare the advantages and disadvantages of HSNs and the A-Train directly. Ultimately, the appropriate platform depends on the mission objectives at hand.

8. OUTLOOK  The paradigm of HSNs is not limited to the use of small spacecraft only, nor is the utilization of such networks limited to LEO. A grander vision should encompass spacecraft of all sizes and origin to construct a networking environment in orbit much similar to the one established on Earth through the advent of the Internet. Heading towards internet-working between spacecraft through the incremental development of new technological solutions will almost certainly increase the effectiveness of operations in space. The point we attempt to make in this paper is not centered around the use of any given standard, such as 802. 1 1 . Other publicly available solutions such as ZigBee, or modifications thereof, may very well be the preferred option in the long run (see [3]  for evidence going into this direction). The optimal communications solutions may change from application to application. Beyond LEO, Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) capabilities may be needed such as described in [ 1 ] . We believe that HSNs are a fruitful and promising area for future R&D.
