Service-Quality Criteria of Web Recruiters: A Content Analysis

Abstract   Despite the widespread use of ICT systems in e- recruiting services, there is little research on how recruiters judge the quality of different e-recruiting services. We explore, from the recruiters? perspective, staffing quality improvements and limitations since beginning to use e-recruiting services, the most frequent requests emailed by recruiters to an external e-recruiting service, and the criteria recruiters associate with high e-service quality and how e-service quality can be enhanced.

We interviewed 73 recruiters and content-analyzed a large data set of e-mail communications between recruiters and service personnel of an e-recruiting portal for university graduates. Surprisingly, recruiters judge the quality of e-recruiting services primarily by the quantity and not necessarily on the quality of applications, high number of visits to the website, clicks on published job ads, page impressions, successful placements, the size of the applicant pool, and the quality of cooperation with other media channels so as to reach more applicants.

1. Introduction   Traditionally, most service encounters involve one customer and one customer-service employee at one point in time. In recent years, advances in technology have enabled a rapidly growing number of customers to access services through digital communications such as email and using the company?s website. As online business transactions are increasing, so are the expectations of customers using online channels [16, 17, 32]. This is especially salient in the domain of personnel services such as e- recruiting services where a vast number of different providers emerge. Job applicants, as well as professional recruiters and organizations in need of personnel, are increasingly using the internet [15].

Service quality has been identified as one of the key factors in determining the success or failure of  electronic commerce [28]. Further, Tong et al. [38] note that because employers usually need to pay for the services of recruitment websites, their perceptions of website service quality are seen as more important than job seekers? views.

Despite this trend, academic literature on the service quality of different e-recruiting portals is sparse [37]. Several researchers [7, 18, 33] have noted the need to gain better understanding of payers? evaluations of e-service quality, not only in a general sense, but to identify determinants of the specific e- service environment. Although it seems obvious that service quality criteria are not exactly the same across different internet services (e.g., compare service quality criteria of an online bookshop with that of internet banking and an e-recruiting site), certain service criteria are likely to be the same across different internet services, such as fulfillment and reliability of order and billing, easy navigation on the website, responsiveness and system availability, etc.

Knowledge of which factors recruiters associate with high quality e-recruiting services may enable e- recruiting providers to better serve their customers and help them to differentiate themselves from other providers. Hence, in this study we explore the factors that e-recruiters see as important for high quality service in e-recruiting environments. Given the exploratory nature of this study, we elicited the criteria by interviewing full-time recruiters. To interpret the criteria in the context of e-recruiters? daily work, we analyzed the content of all emails directed from recruiters to an e-recruiting portal over the period of one year. This was done to get a further sense of recruiters? needs through analysis of the typical and most frequent requests posed by recruiters and their personnel. This provided another way of finding out what is important to corporate recruiters when they outsource recruitment.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: we first provide a theoretical background; then, we outline our methodology; and finally, we present our results and concluding insights.

2. Theoretical Background  2.1 Research on e-Recruitment  A general market trend is that company recruiters are increasingly using the internet to advertise job postings and search applicant pools, so as to attract a wider set of prospective candidates than traditional recruiting processes allow [15]. Already in 2001, Capelli [4] reported that 90 percent of large US companies were recruiting via the internet. Moreover, [21] showed that virtually all Fortune 100 companies use some form of e-recruiting methods and that 94% of the Global 500 companies use their own company websites for recruitment. According to Cober et al.

[5], 50 percent of new hires in the US were found through online sources. Further, Crispin, and Merler [8] found that 20 percent of external hires in the US were selected via corporate websites and 13 percent via commercial job boards. These numbers are expected to increase further and the trend is expected to spread into many other countries. Parry [29] reported on a survey of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development in which it was found that about two-thirds of UK organizations use some form of online recruitment. He notes that of those organizations that currently uses online recruitment methods, around a third expect to increase their use.

Even though research on e-recruiting is still sparse [29, 36], the growing number of recent academic papers show that there is an increase in the attention (e.g. [1, 2, 24, 36]. Until about five years ago, most studies focused on applicant reactions [12, 13, 42]. Research in this area has been carried out also to find out why companies and recruiters decide to use e-recruiting [29]. Specifically, Wolters? [41] review of the literature noted the following reasons: low costs; recruitment time reduction; larger pool of possible candidates; more information; anonymity; higher quality of responses; easy automatic screening and filtering of applications; and the availability of smart agents (search tools using a number of selection criteria). A 2006 survey conducted by the CIPD reveals that the most important reasons to use e-recruitment are cost reduction (71 percent); broadening of selection pool (60 percent); and shortening of time required to hire (47 percent).

Less research attention has been given to employers? or recruiters? views on the effectiveness of different e-recruiting services. Recent studies led to the following summarized results. First, Wolters? study on job boards found that there is a negative relationship between the amount of information given about the job and the percentage of suitable reactions [41]. He also found that e-recruitment is no longer reserved for higher-educated or IT-personnel only.

Secondly, Parry [29] studied the adoption of e- recruitment methods. He found that employers base their decisions on whether or not to use their corporate website for recruiting purposes on whether companies? competitors and target job seekers have adopted this method. The use of commercial job boards is based on both external and internal compatibility, that is the fit with existing organizational systems and culture.

2.2 E-Recruiting and its Challenges  Seen from the organization?s perspective, the primary goal of the recruiting process is to find the best and most suitable candidate for an open position as quickly as possible [37]. In this process, more and more employers find e-recruiting services indispensable for meeting their staffing needs.

However, e-recruiting itself is not a fixed service. It includes several different tools and applications that bring different services and accompanying challenges with them. Major services include general job boards (e.g., www.monster.com, www.hotjobs.com), specialized niche job sites (e.g., www.dice.com, www.beyond.com), using resume databases or applicant pools (www.absolventa.de) chat rooms, newsgroups or networks (e.g., www.hrnet.org), using personnel placement services and company websites.

Similarly, Wolters [41], based on [14, 24, 26] identified the following approaches to internet-based recruiting: using company websites, job boards, e- recruiting, media websites (electronic versions of newspapers and magazines), relationship recruiting (social networking), and discussion boards and forums. Also, many professional organizations offer niche job boards, for instance, the Academy of Management (AoM) for university jobs in management and related business fields. Another example is the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) for HR positions. In order to best meet their staffing needs, much of a recruiting budget is typically spent on internet platforms. Every year, most recruiters face decisions on which e- recruiting service and partners to invest in. Already at the beginning of the e-recruiting hype, Cullen [9] noted:  ?At one level the success of e-recruiting shows that the application of technology can create huge efficiencies and financial savings in HR. At a higher level, e-recruiting demonstrates the critical need for the redesign and integration of most HR systems and practices.?  E-recruiting service organizations also face many challenges, such as keeping the applicants profiles up-to-date. Another struggle still tends to be the challenge of delivering semantically accurate search results when offering applicant-pool search functions.

Besides this, posting resumes on job boards also calls for consideration of privacy and security issues.

Often, both an applicant?s and recruiter?s name, address and phone number are displayed for anyone to see. Regarding automated skill tests and using computers to determine whether an applicant should be interviewed, critics argue that such processes seem to not support what HR is actually about ? people- orientation [36]. Applicants may also be more likely to falsify their profile data in online applications than in traditional face-to-face interviews. As a result, rather than selecting most qualified applicants, resume scanning systems may select applicants who are most capable of intuiting and using the right words in applications [37]. Another drawback of e- recruitment is the danger of being flooded with resumes (or more in general, the unpredictability of the number of responses), tracking difficulties, and the non-availability of the internet to certain segments of the labor market [29]. Although high quality e-recruiting services require effective systems as a quasi ?hygiene factor,? the true ?motivator? for recruiters when deciding to cooperate with a specific service provider on an ongoing basis may be rather the service offered by the people behind the technology Thus, there is enough  justification for exploring the factors that recruiters associate with high quality e-recruiting service. Given the paucity of academic research on these issues, we will first present the relevant literature.

2.3 E-Service Quality  Increasingly, rather than face-to-face, customers are interacting with organizations via ICT-mediated channels. Hence, we need to better understand how these developments can best be complemented by the delivery of high quality e-services [25]. High service quality has been found to enhance customer satisfaction, customer retention, and consequently, organizational performance e.g., [3, 17, 31]. And already high e-service quality has been found to enhance a webpage?s attractiveness, hit rates and recommendations [35]. The current literature uses such terms as e-service quality, online service quality, and web service quality to denote services provided on the Internet. A variety of conceptualizations on e-service quality have already been proposed. For instance, e-service quality has been defined as the extent to which a website facilitates efficient and effective shopping, purchasing, and delivery of products and services [6, 24, 35]. Originally 11 dimensions of e-service quality (e-SQ) were proposed: (1) reliability; (2) responsiveness; (3) access, (4) flexibility, (5) ease of navigation, (6) efficiency, (7) assurance/trust, (8)  security/privacy, (9) price knowledge, (10) site aesthetics, and (11) customization/personalization.

More recently, Zeithaml, Parasuraman and Malhotra, [28] reduced those 11 dimensions to 4 dimensions of e-service quality and 3 dimensions of e-recovery service quality: (see Table 1). The e-recovery dimensions were proposed for non-routine encounters and only play a role when facing service failure.

While some of these e-service quality and e-recovery service criteria are the same in traditional service quality dimensions (e.g., fulfillment, reliability of the service received), others are unique or more typical of e-service contexts (e.g., privacy issues in e-recruiting portals).

Table 1. E-Service Quality (Parasuraman et al., 2005)   E-Service Quality  1. Efficiency Ease and speed of accessing and using services  2. Fulfillment Extent to which promises about order delivery and item availability are fulfilled  3. Privacy Degree to which the service is safe and protects customer information 4. System Availability  Correct technical functioning of the service  E-Recovery Service Quality  1. Compensation  Degree to which customers are compensated for problems  2. Contact Availability of assistance though telephone or on-line representatives  3. Responsiveness Effective handling of problems   As e-service quality is a multidimensional and  context-dependent concept, online service providers must take care to understand what specific needs their customer segments have [6, 34, 40]. While some online services complement traditional face-to-face service with e-service, (much of the banking industry,) others focus exclusively on e-service (e.g., amazon.com). In order to satisfy an organization?s recruiters? needs and consequently establish high customer value, providers of e-recruiting services need to understand their users and offer the things that are most desired. This paper?s goal is to enhance this understanding. Specifically, we aimed to explore four main research questions: (1) What improvements and limitations in the quality of the staffing process do corporate recruiters experience since using external e-recruiting services?

(2) What are the most frequent kinds of email requests that recruiters approach an external e- recruiting service for?

(3) What are the characteristics of high service quality in e-recruiting services?

(4) How can the service quality of external e- recruiting be enhanced?

3. Research Design   This explorative study follows the interpretive approach to qualitative research; we conducted semi- structured interviews and analyzed the content of recruiters? digital communications for contextual meaning. We followed Klein and Myers?s [19] set of principles for interpretive field studies in conducting IS research. In order to start answering our research questions, we interviewed 73 recruiters, consisting of 46 females and 27 males. Most of these 73 recruiters were employed at larger companies with high demand for university graduates at diverse levels. We also collected and content-analyzed all email communications directed from recruiters to a university recruiting service over the entire year 2007. The digital data was obtained in order to help us answer our second and third research question.

Research question 1 and 4 were answered by analyzing the interview data. Both methods of data collection were helpful in exploring the meaning of high service quality in e-recruiting services.

3.1 Interviews  Over a period of two years, two persons conducted 73 open-ended interviews at 12 similar university career fairs in Austria and Germany.

Ahead of time, we piloted the first version of the interview guide and feedback resulted in revisions to the guide. The interviewers first observed the recruiters at the career fairs and made sure to only approach them when they were standing alone; waiting for potential applicants; and appearing to have time. On average, our interviews with recruiters lasted between 10-20 minutes. In most cases, it was not possible to interview the recruiters longer than 20 minutes since applicants came and waited in line to talk with them. However, after the first site visits, the interviewers realized that the best time for the interviews was either early in the morning or around lunchtime. Hence, in several cases, the recruiters could be interviewed more than 20 minutes.

During all interviews, comprehensive field notes were taken. Researchers such as Van Maanen [39] regard field notes as the ?secret papers of social research? which comprise the most important observations. After each individual interview, the interviewers supplemented their notes with everything that they remembered from the  conversations. In addition, after each career fair day, the 2 interviewees met, compared their field notes, and discussed their impressions [30]. The interviews were analyzed right after finalizing all interviews when interviewers still remembered much of the data that were orally conveyed to them by the interviewees. We analyzed common themes related to our research questions. These categories were then broken into sub-categories, based on the responses of the recruiters [22, 27]. In line with the constant comparison method of data analysis, we continually modified the preliminary categories, eliminating old ones and adding new ones to account for newly acquired evidence [19].

3.2 Digital Communications  Another comparative data set was derived from digital communications, namely, e-mail exchange between recruiters and service personnel of an Austrian e-recruiting portal for university graduates.

All incoming emails directed from recruiters to the university e-recruiting service (from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2007) were collected. We made every effort in deleting disqualified emails, e.g., spamming messages, advertising, duplications, messages with empty text body, and any messages sent from other individuals or organizations that were not recruiters or marketing personnel (e.g., emails from students or graduates directed to the university portal). Naturally, we excluded all automated response mails such as registration confirmations, undelivered messages, out of office replies, subscribed newsletters or new password requests. In order to get a sense of the kind of requests recruiters make when approaching an e-recruiting portal, we analyzed all ?proper? emails: in total n=1638.

Content-analyzing this digital communication is likely to enhance our understanding of the day-to-day work of recruiters, their expectations, complaints, and feedback on their services usage. Together, it will show how recruiters evaluate e-service quality.

In developing the initial text-analysis categories, two researchers collaborated in reading the first 200 incoming messages from recruiters. Discussion between the coders was necessary to resolve different understandings and disagreements [30]. For instance, we coded all emails that dealt with recruiters? e- marketing-related orders with ?e-marketing order? instead of using separate labels for ordering online company presentations, e-newsletter, event invitations, company image banner, candidate relationship management etc. After we had agreed on the coding scheme, we independently coded another set of 100 incoming emails from recruiters.

Intercoder reliability between the 2 coders was        calculated using the percentage agreement statistic [11]. A satisfying level of 0.92 was achieved, so we decided that one coder would code the remaining emails.  Next, one of us calculated the frequencies of the different kinds of email communications [20].

The so-derived data presents the categorized ?real- life? context of recruiters? digital communications directed at a university e-recruiting service. We grouped emerging service criteria into relevant factors, most of which were defined by the reviewed previous studies. Since some of the identified service quality criteria could not be assigned to the criteria discovered in previous studies, we added a few new categories. We thought through existing theory of e- service quality [28] and information systems success [10], and how unique service criteria or patterns thereof may apply to the specific context of e- recruiting services. We presumed that researchers must also intrude into the recruiters` world to more comprehensively understand recruiters? email communications. Pure content analysis of the recruiters? emails would not have this explorative effect that we achieved by analyzing explorative interview results in addition to the email communications. Similarly, Ngwengama and Lee?s [23] study of information richness in e-mail communication also used interpretive methods to enhance the findings. Hence, both methods contributed to gain insights below the surface of recruiters? perceptions.

4. Results   We present the findings in line with our four key research questions. We illustrate these with quotes from the recruiters to show the richness of our data.

The first research question concerns improvements and limitations of the staffing quality process due to using e-recruiting services. Importantly, every interviewed recruiter makes active use of (external) e- recruiting services. All were able to identify improvements in their staffing process due to this e- recruiting (Table 2). Recruiters frequently note that they receive more applications, reach more applicants, and have better possibilities for e- marketing initiatives such as employer branding since their use of e-recruiting services: ?Certainly, the greatest quality enhancement of our staffing process is that we have more possibilities to select the best candidate, since we receive many more applications than via newspaper ads.? And: ?Since using e-recruiting services, our ads reach a much larger potential audience.? or: ?It?s not only that we get more resumes, we also can market our company to more potential employees.?  Table 2. Staffing quality improvements since using e-recruiting   # Frequency Improvements  66 More incoming applications 53 Wider reach of applicants 42 E-marketing incl. employer branding,  candidate relationship management, event announcements, newsletter etc.

26 Cost savings 19 Longer online availability of job ads 15 Time savings 8 Possibility for more precise job ad  descriptions compared to newspapers  Most recruiters were also able to identify  limitations in their staffing process since using e- recruiting services (Table 3). Specifically, they noted that actual behavior, appearance and communication skills of the candidates can?t be observed via online recruitment: ?Sure, I need to meet the applicants and get to know them in person, this is essential before making any placement decisions.? Although saving time has been frequently reported in major studies on e-recruiting e.g., [41] this finding was not confirmed by all of our interviewees; Fifteen recruiters mentioned saving time due to the use of e-recruiting, whereas 11 recruiters claimed that saving time was not obvious.  One recruiter claimed: ?You have to bear in mind that the amount of applications from people who are not fitting the job description is higher by using online services. It is easy for applicants to send one email application to everybody. Usually, I sort out those careless applications right away, however it also takes time to sort through your mailbox.?   Table 3. Staffing quality limitations  since using e-recruiting   # Frequency Limitations 54 Can?t judge actual behavior, appearance of  candidate 32 Can?t judge communication  skills  such as  observed  in assessment centers 27 Incomplete or inappropriate profiles,  responsiveness and timeliness 18 Less data ownership/flexibility in resume  forms by using external agencies compared to own company career sites  11 Time consuming to update databases; collect additional data; and control testimonials  7 In-house systems may not easily link to external providers; cost limitation for internal ICT development  6 Difficult to reach certain labor groups        Other issues that were both positively and negatively assessed in the context of staffing quality concern the possibility to search in applicant pools and the matching of job to applicant profile.

Our second research question concerns the most frequent kinds of requests that are asked of an university career service, see Table 4). In almost a quarter of the emails (23 %), recruiters request information or pose questions to the e-recruiting service personnel. Most frequent questions deal with the average amount of webpage visitors per day and month (or other time frames), the average amount of visitors clicking on individual job ads, page impressions, the size and growth of the registered applicant pool, and inquiries on possibilities for e- marketing to specific user groups (i.e., employer branding, candidate relationship management, event announcements, newsletter). When recruiters from larger companies visit the recruiting platform the first time, many try to get free trials to publish one or two job ads. They do this in order to monitor how many applications they receive by using a new e-recruiting service. Such requests for test use are very common among recruiters. Paradoxically, what seems to matter the most to recruiters is the quantity of applications received though using new services. The following examples illustrate those requests:  ?Dear Customer Representative, I am interested in publishing job ads on your platform. How large is your database of applicants and how many companies have access to this database? How many of your registered applicants have master degrees? I could not find media data such as total number of visits to your page. Please provide us with this information and make an offer so that we can test the rebound of applicants.

Best regards, Denise Hall, Human Resources?  ?Dear Mr. Hofbauer, I wanted to collect some information about your graduate portal. I am a professional scout and I always search for the best applicants for our customers. In order to evaluate a potential cooperation, I would like to know the average visits on your site per day and per month. I already have visited your price page. In order to make a quick decision, I would appreciate your response soon.

Kind regards, Petrus Kollabe, Recruiting ? Nearly twenty percent of the emails were regular orders (different job-related services). When recruiters make orders, they either send the job descriptions as attachments in different formats such as doc, pdf, or ppt, or send the job description within email text field. They may also send links to their  company site and want that the external recruiting services publishes those ads on its website so as to reach a larger audience. When looking through the orders, it becomes obvious that most recruiters write focused and very short messages, probably to save time. The next two emails illustrate typical orders.

?Dear ladies and gentlemen, Please search for appropriate candidates for us, as described in the attachment. Also, publish this info on your career service. You can get in touch with me if you have any further questions. With best regards, Sylvia Kerndl, Staffing Coordinator?  ?Dear Ms. Berger!

I?m ordering the classic package for ? 1.800,-- as advertised on your website. The takeover of job ads should be done automatically and daily from our company site. If you need any further information, you can contact me at any time. Thanks and kind regards, Angela Lohneberger, Human Resources?  Many recruiters want to combine e-recruiting with e- marketing initiatives. In 13 % of the emails, recruiters requested marketing-related services (e.g., advertisements to specified target groups; company banner and logo advertising; e-newsletter, announcements of company events on the webpage).

The following example illustrates this:  ?Dear Ms. Velders, I wanted to find out if it is possible to send information to the graduates? If yes, how many lines, how often can we advertise and how many graduates (from what fields) will get the newsletter?

Thanks in advance and best regards, Brigitte Pokkl, Human Resources Administration? Further, 11% of the emails reflect changes or cancellations of orders, e.g. if a position has already been filled and recruiters want to deactivate the ad.

Also, sometimes recruiters want to adjust some wording in the description. Another 9% are designated for order confirmations and thank you messages. Also 9% concern technical or service questions (i.e., errors, login problems, adjustment of job ad indexing, improve publishing picture quality, company logo too small etc.). The following email presents such a technical question.

?Dear Mr. Mayer, Can you please let me know in what category you published our job ad? I can?t find it by searching for technical jobs. It should be assigned to the category ?Technical Jobs? or it should be found by the keywords "Service Technician, Mechatronical        Engineer, Synthetic Technician...." Can you still change this? Regards, Miriam Polter, HR Assistant?  Only 4% of the recruiters? emails could not be fit into the defined categories (Table 4). Those emails dealt with, for instance, meeting arrangements or invitations or updates. Finally, 3 % of emails came from public bodies (like associations, educational institutes, clubs etc.) and private firms (banks, insurances, travel agencies etc.) requesting cooperation agreements, and 1% dealt with complaints.

Table 4. Email themes in e-recruiting services  Percentage Frequency Themes  23 %   373 Request information 19 %   304 Regular (re)order (publish  jobs, search and suggest candidates)  13 %   219 E-marketing order 11 %   184 Change or cancellation of  order 9 %   147 Confirmation of order,  thank you notes 9 %   141 Technical or service  questions, errors 8 %   125 Billing contact details, price  negotiation, payments 4 %   72 Other 3 %   52 Public bodies and private  firms requesting cooperation agreements  1 %    21 Complaints 100 %      1638   In order to answer our third research question on  distinguishing characteristics of high service quality, we compared the e-service quality criteria of Parasuraman et al. [28] and those of the Lone and Mc Lean [10] model with our results (see Table 5). We captured the essence of the scales rather than reporting on every scale item. Comparing the criteria, we see they overlap in many cases. Some differentiations emerged: The independent dimension ?Information Quality? by De Lone and Mc Lean [10] is not classified as separate quality criteria in the Parasuraman et al. [28] scale but included in different dimensions such as the ?Efficiency? criteria. The frequently cited ?Privacy? criteria have neither been identified in our interviews, nor in the email communications as important. We can assume that privacy is assumed to be a ?hygiene factor? for recruiters. Also, many recruiters are interested in publicly advertising for their organization; hence they put all their personal contact data out so that applicants can easily contact them.  In these cases,  privacy concerns seem of minor importance to recruiters. And when asked about the data they want to see in a CV, indeed many recruiters requested that it would be good to get more personalized data from the applicants such as age, gender and telephone number. Surprisingly, the most frequently mentioned distinguishing quality criteria that strongly influence company recruiters? decision to cooperate with an external recruiting service had not been identified by the two criteria sets in the literature. This quality criterion is represented by ?Statistics? in Table 5.

Recruiters clearly associate service quality with the recruiting services? ability to attract many visitors to the website; page impressions; high number of clicks on published job ads and company logos; the number of incoming applications; number of up-to-date profiles; successful placements within a certain time frame; the size and growth rate of the applicant pool if available; and the quality of cooperation with other media channels (i.e. newspapers) so as to reach many potential applicants. Moreover, the criterion ?Range of services selection? has not been defined by the two scales. This includes if, for example, a recruiting service provides only basic functions such as job publishing or also supplementary services such as search, full placement, e-marketing services such as employer branding, skill tests etc.

While Parasuraman et al. [28] explain that the e- recovery criteria Compensation, Contact and Responsiveness were developed for non-routine encounters and only play a role when the organization is facing service failure, our findings show that these three criterion apply throughout the process of e-recruiting service delivery. In fact, as shown by our content-analyzed results for how to enhance the service quality in e-recruiting, the improvement in responsiveness and reliability scored highest (mentioned by 52 out of 73 recruiters, see Table 6). Another quality-related point worth mentioning is that most e-recruiting services publish their prices online. The recruiters? emails reveal that many of them try to negotiate prices for using job services. Often, they make comparisons with other services explaining benefits they receive when cooperating with other providers, or try to get a cheaper price by communicating that other providers have more visitors, clicks, a larger applicant pool or more flexible service options. By looking at the actual booking behavior of services with and without granting deductions, the negotiation behavior seems more of a common work practice than a factor of importance to use a certain service. Hence, getting a cheap cooperation agreement with e-recruiting services or the price of services seems of lower priority in differentiating service quality.

( 2005)  De Lone & Mc Lean (2003)  Interviews Emails  Efficiency Relates to System, Service and Information Quality  Automatic and daily job ad updates,  easy navigation, accurate search, fast and easy resumes download, speed  Quick registration, easy purchase process, automatic and daily job ad updates, easy navigation,  Fulfillment Service Quality Order accuracy, billing accuracy, up-to-date profiles, customization  Order accuracy, billing accuracy, up-to-date profiles and ads, flexibility to adjust orders, various payment options  Privacy System Quality No  No System Availability  System Quality Hygiene factor, presumed that systems work, fast loading page, integration with eHRM systems  Technical queries, improve workflow/interfaces, HR-XML  Compensation Service Quality Candidate replacement if leaving before 6 months in a job  Price reduction if not enough applications received, longer online availability of job ads  Contact Service Quality Different contact possibilities, email, phone, in person, online request forms  Phone frequently preferred for first arrangements  Responsiveness Service Quality Not only as e-recovery (problems) criteria, rather general, fast and reliable communications, timeliness  Not only as e-recovery (problems) criteria, rather general, fast and reliable communications  Included in several of the above criterion  Information Quality Up-to-date web site with relevant information, transparent info, find information quickly, FAQs, ratings and reviews from other recruiters who have used the service  Transparent info, automatic daily updates of job ads, updates on new registered, suitable candidates; profiles that have been already viewed  - - Range of services selection, only job publishing or full placement, skill tests etc.

- - Statistics (# visitors, # page impressions, # incoming applications, # cooperation with other media channels)  Statistics (# visitors, # page impressions, # successful placements, # incoming applications, # applicant pool)   In the interviews, recruiters were also asked how  the service quality of (external) e-recruiting could be enhanced. To this question, we got a wide range of answers (Table 6). Foremost significant, and identified by 52 of all 73 recruiters, is to enhance the responsiveness and reliability of the service personnel and the applicants? answers to recruiters? requests.

Recruiters complained frequently of time loss due to applicants not answering in time or recruiting agencies needing too much time to suggest suitable candidates. Particularly dissatisfying is the response rate when searching in applicant databases. Some recruiters suggested services that differentiate between actively and passively searching candidates.

In regard to applicant search functions, 42 recruiters emphasized that the accuracy of matching between applicant profiles and job descriptions needs much improvement. Several recruiters explained that they prefer to get applications directly sent to them instead of searching databases and headhunting candidates  who might not be interested in the open job anyway.

Further, 37 recruiters suggested to extend the spectrum of services. Also frequently mentioned were the following service criteria: keep applicants? profiles up-to-date; don?t overload recruiting websites with irrelevant information; improve navigation in order to find things quickly and easily; automatic daily updates of job ads on e-recruiting sites when corporate pages are updated; offer different possibilities of how to index job ads; and improve workflow/ integration with external eHRM systems. Besides these rather frequently identified improvements, several recruiters came up with the following service quality ideas: enhance niche recruiting services to target applicant segments more specifically; possibility to co-determine what data is collected; open recruiting platform listing all open jobs and all potential applicants in a specified region; improvements in data exchanges such as HR-XML; and multilingual job postings.

Table 6. Enhancing the quality of  e-recruiting   # Frequency 52 Enhance responsiveness and reliability to  recruiters? requests 42 Improve applicant search functions 37 Provide more services 32 Keep applicants? profiles up-to-date 26 Don?t overload recruiting websites with  irrelevant information 21 Improve navigation, make registrations  easier and faster 17 Automatic daily updates of job ads on e-  recruiting sites when corporate pages are updated  13 Offer different possibilities on how to index job ads  9 Improve workflow/ integration with external eHRM systems   5. Conclusions  In this study, we interviewed 73 recruiters and content-analyzed a large data set of e-mail communications between recruiters and service personnel of an e-recruiting portal for university graduates (throughout 2007). Specifically, we analyzed recruiters? perceptions of improvements and limitations in the quality of the staffing process since beginning to use e-recruiting services. We further explored the most frequent requests emailed by recruiters to an external e-recruiting service. Finally, we revealed characteristics of high service quality in e-recruiting services and how the service quality can be enhanced.

Recruiters frequently note that they receive more applications, reach more applicants, and have better possibilities for e-marketing initiatives such as employer branding since beginning to use e- recruiting services. However, they found that actual behavior, appearance and communication skills of the candidates cannot be observed via online recruitment.

Recruiters? most frequent kinds of emails include information inquiries about the recruiting portal; regular (re)orders such as publishing jobs online or suggesting candidates; e-marketing orders; change, cancellation or confirmation mails; technical, service- related and billing questions.

An e-recruiting portals? e-service quality has been clearly associated with its ability to attract many visitors to the website; page impressions; high number of clicks on published job ads and company logos; the number of incoming applications; number of up-to-date profiles; successful placements within a certain timeframe; the size and growth rate of the applicant pool, if available; and the quality of  cooperation with other media channels so as to reach many potential applicants.  This e-service quality criterion has been labeled statistics. Also, range of services selection  (i.e. does the site provide only basic functions such as job publishing or also supplementary services such as search, full placement, employer branding, skill tests) has been related with high e-service quality. Finally, recruiters suggested ways as to how e-service quality can be enhanced. Of foremost importance is the need to enhance the responsiveness and reliability of the service personnel?s and the applicants? answers to recruiters? requests. Other e-service quality enhancements include: improve applicant search functions; provide more services; keep applicants? profiles up-to-date, don?t overload site with irrelevant information, improve website navigation, provide automatic daily updates of job ads, offer different possibilities on how to index jobs and improve workflow/integration with external eHRM systems.
