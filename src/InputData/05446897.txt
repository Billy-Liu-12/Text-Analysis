Near the Ground Laser Communication System: Fried Parameter Estimation from the WFS Measurements

Abstract? Near the ground laser communication systems must operate in the presence of strong atmospheric turbu- lence. The effects of atmospheric turbulence on the laser beam which are relevant to optical communications are a broadening of the laser footprint, random jitter of the laser beam, and high spatial frequency intensity fluctuations re- ferred to as scintillation. The overall goal of our program is to improve the performance and extend the range of opti- cal communications systems by exploring the use of adaptive optics and channel coding. Knowledge of the turbulence con- ditions and the ability to describe its properties are the key aspects to make these improvements effective. The multi- phase approach described here is directed to statistically de- scribe atmospheric turbulence based on results derived from experimentally collected data. To model the performance of a real world system, we have developed an outdoor path par- tially over water, spanning 3 km turbulence measurement and monitoring system. The system described in this paper has two transmitters and two receivers. The transmitter side is equipped with a laser and a bank of 14 horizontally, in-line mounted LEDs. The laser transmitter and LED operate at 808 nm with laser power of 2mW. The receiver side con- sists of two channels. The WFS channel captures the signal from the laser transmitter and is specifically designated for the wavefront sensing. The wavefront sensor channel con- sists of relay optics, a Hartmann WFS, and a CCD camera.

The PSF channel is designed to capture the signal from LED bar and consists of relay optics and a CCD camera. The data collected from the PSF channel is used for measurements of anisoplanetic effects. In this paper we emphasize the data col- lection and consecutive analysis from the WFS channel only.

Statistics of the Fried parameter r0 are derived from 6TB of data collected over 50 days under various day and night at- mospheric conditions. Significant fluctuations of r0 are found with the values ranging from 2mm and up to 15cm.
