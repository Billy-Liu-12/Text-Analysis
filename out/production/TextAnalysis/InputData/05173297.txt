Time and Temperature Dependence of Early Stage  Stress-Induced-Voiding in Cu/Low-k interconnects

Abstract ? The time and temperature dependence of Stress- Induced-Voiding below and in copper VIA?s with a diameter of 80nm integrated in a k=2.5 material was studied. The focus was on the early phase of the voiding process. To accelerate the degradation, test structures with big metal plates below and/or above the VIA were used. We found two degradation mechanisms in which one dominated below and the other dominated above a certain temperature. The first mechanism has an activation energy of 0.9eV and is the result of interface-diffusion driven by a stress-gradient. This mechanism was more pronounced below the VIA, but was significant in the VIA as well. The second mechanism has an activation energy of 1.2eV, which is argued to be driven by grain boundary diffusion due to a vacancy gradient in and above the VIA. To explain both mechanisms, an addition to the traditional stress-creep model is proposed and fits our data well. Additionally, it is discussed that VIA?s connected to the center of big metal plates above and below the VIA are less susceptible to SIV compared to VIA?s connected to line ends either below or on top of the VIA. We support our argumentation and analytical modeling with Finite Element Modeling.

I.  INTRODUCTION Stress-Induced-Voiding (SIV) is one of the predominant  failure mechanisms of multi-layer on-chip interconnects. SIV is the result of vacancy movement driven by stress-gradients in and around VIA?s that connect different metal layers. These gradients are the consequence of a thermal mismatch between the metal and the surrounding materials. Stress relaxation leads to vacancy movement, formation of micro-voids and void growth, potentially resulting in non-operational devices [1,2].

SIV can happen both below and in a VIA. To get voiding below a VIA, the main diffusion path of vacancies is the copper/cap interface and a reservoir of vacancies needs to be present in the metal layer under the VIA [1]. To get voiding in a VIA, the main diffusion path is the copper/barrier interface and a reservoir of vacancies needs to be present in the VIA itself [3,4]. Literature reporting on data with SiO2 as intermetal dielectric (IMD), mainly describe voiding below the VIA as the main cause for failure and voids in the VIA were mainly attributed to non-optimized VIA-processes [5]. Recent studies however show that more severe stress gradients are present in/above the VIA when integrated in porous low-k materials, making the voiding in the VIA more apparent [4,6,7].

SIV is the result of vacancy movement driven by a stress gradient. At low temperatures, this stress gradient is high, but the thermal activation is low, while the opposite holds at higher temperatures. As such, unlike other BEOL degradation mechanisms, SIV cannot be accelerated by the application of higher temperatures. Degradation data at different temperatures are needed to understand the complex balance between stress gradient and thermal activation of vacancies.

A common way to accelerate SIV is in the design of the test structures. Typical SIV structures consist of big metal plates below or above a VIA [1,5,6] or of long metal lines with VIA?s connected to the center of these lines [8]. Care must be taken when extrapolating the result of such symmetrical structures to the real (asymmetrical) case where VIA?s are connected to line ends.

This paper summarizes a detailed study of the temperature dependence of SIV both below and in copper VIA?s with a diameter of 80nm integrated in a low-k material (k=2.5). Both symmetrical and asymmetrical test structures were studied. The focus in this study was on the degradation mechanism of SIV in these materials. Hence, the early phase of the voiding process was studied, i.e where the VIA-resistance increases by a few up to about 10 percent.



II. EXPERIMENTAL  A. Test material Dual damascene copper structures were integrated on  300mm wafers in a SiOCH CVD low-k dielectric (k-value ~2.5, porosity ~25%, E-modulus ~9GPa). A 5/25nm SiCN/SiCO etch stop layer (E-modulus ~100 GPa) was used between M1 and VIA/M2-level. A 3/3nm TaN/Ta barrier was used between copper and dielectric. The wafer was passivated with a 5/25nm SiCN/SiCO, 300nm SiO2 and 500nm Si3N4- stack.

B. Test structures To study the voiding below a VIA, a 10x10?m M1-plane  structure was designed with two 80nm VIA?s positioned 4?m from each other. Each VIA was connected to a narrow M2-line that was connected to a bondpad (figure 1a). To study the voiding in a VIA, the same structure as above was designed, but now M1 and M2 were swapped (figure 1b). To study both  Physics Symposium, Montreal, 2009    mechanisms in one and the same structure, a Kelvin structure was used having a 6x6?m M1- and M2-plane positioned below and on top of the 80nm VIA (figure 1c).

C. Test set-up In order to avoid wafer-to-wafer variability, sister devices  from the exact same wafer were used for the study. This was done by cutting up the wafer in 24 different pieces that were divided into 6 groups in such a way that within-wafer effects were avoided (figure 2). Each group contained ~20-25 die?s and was stressed at 150, 175, 200, 225, 250 and 275 ?C, respectively. Measurements were taken after 4, 9 and 16 days of storage. An absolute shift in the resistance per VIA has been used as drift criterion.

D. Finite Element Modeling A 3D finite element model of the three structures shown in  figure 1 was created in ANSYS Multi-Physics. All materials were considered to be isotropic linear elastic solids. The  material properties of each material were determined using internal data.



III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Figure 3 shows the absolute drift/VIA for the three different  structures annealed at temperatures between 150 and 275?C for 9 days. Two different regions are observed for all three structures. The drift/VIA in region I (< 225?C) shows a peak, while region II (>225?C) shows a steady increase of the degradation as a function of temperature. The peak in region I is highest for the M1-plane structure, but is significant for the M2-plane and the Kelvin structure as well.  Also, the location of the peak in this region is different for the different structures.

The steady increase of the drift in region II is more significant for M2-planes and Kelvins compared to M1-planes. It is also remarkable that there is no temperature at which the drift is zero, indicating that a true stress free temperature might not be present or a mechanism which is not stress-driven plays a role in the degradation process.

A. M1-plane structure shows a higher drift in region I compared to M2-plane structure.

It is expected that voiding will happen below the VIA for  the M1-planes as the M1-plane acts as a vacancy source and a stress-gradient under the VIA accumulates these vacancies under the VIA [1]. For the M2-planes, voids are expected to happen by vacancy accumulation in the VIA. Vacancy sources here are expected to be in the copper/barrier interface and/or vacancies in the copper itself [3,4].

Earlier publications argue that the voiding in a VIA is due to non-optimized VIA processes [5]. More recent literature, on the other hand, argues that the introduction of materials with a low E-modulus introduce a bigger stress gradient in the VIA, making the structures more vulnerable to voiding in the VIA [4,6,7]. Our simulations support this argument.

the hydrostatic stress gradient in the VIA for the Kelvin structure. The gradient is shown from the VIA center to the top of the M2-layer. Simulations were done at room temperature both for SiO2 and our low-k material as IMD. Higher stress gradients are present in the VIA when using low-k materials, making them more vulnerable to voiding in the VIA compared to SiO2.

In summary, M1-planes lead to void formation below a VIA requiring vacancy diffusion along the copper/cap interface, while M2-planes results in void formation in a VIA driven by vacancies that diffuse along the Cu/barrier interface.

It is well-known that the copper/cap interface is the preferred diffusion path [1,2], making structures with M1-planes more vulnerable to SIV compared to structures with M2-planes. Still, due to higher stress gradients in the VIA when integrated in low-k materials, SIV in structures with M2-planes is found to be significant as well.

B. The steady increase of the drift as function of temperature in region II The steady increase of the drift in region II shown in figure  3 is more significant for structures with M2-planes compared to M1-plane structures.

Above 275?C, oxidation of the barrier underneath the VIA has been reported for unpassivated samples [9]. Such oxidation leads to a resistance increase. On different wafers from the same process, we performed an electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) analysis of the barrier underneath the VIA of samples stressed at 350?C for 4 weeks. This analysis did not show a sign of oxidation (figure 5), so it can be excluded that the drift in region II is due to this mechanism.

Void formation in either of the two metal layers, which is not related to the presence of VIA?s, can be another possible  explanation for the drift increase as a function of temperature in region II. Figure 6 shows the percentage drift of the resistance of narrow M1- and M2-structures without the presence of VIA?s annealed at temperatures between 150 and 275?C for 16 days. Also, the percentage drift of the sheet resistance of wide M1- and M2-layers is depicted. No resistance increase is observed, making the upward shift in region II caused by the presence of VIA?s.

We further investigated the mechanism behind the drift in region II by comparing the time dependence of the degradation processes present in regions I and II. Figure 7 shows the time dependence of the drift/VIA for the structures with M1- and M2-planes for selected temperatures in region I and II.

mechanisms are the cause of both failure mechanisms in regions I and II.

C. Two co-existing mechanisms operating on Region I and Region II  For both structures with an M1- or M2-plane, there is no temperature with a drift of 0 Ohm per VIA (figure 3). This supports the hypothesis that two diffusion mechanisms are active. The degradation mechanism dominant in region I has received more attention in literature and was linked to stress gradients [1,2]. If the degradation mechanism dominant in region II would be driven by a stress gradient as well, one would expect a temperature with zero drift, i.e. at the true stress free temperature which is the temperature point where the copper turns from tensile to compressive stress. As a temperature with zero drift was not observed, the drift in region II cannot be due to a stress gradient alone.

Our FE simulations in figure 8 depict the hydrostatic stress in the copper in the VIA-region at different temperatures.

Around the stress free temperature T0, the stress gradients are very small. This supports the argument that stress gradients cannot be the only driving force for the shifts we observe in region II.  We argue that the diffusion mechanism dominating in region II is driven by the vacancy gradients present in the VIA-region. The additional vacancies generated during the complex low-k trench patterning redistribute through the grains into the VIA, making the VIA resistance increase.

This also explains why this effect is more dominant in structures with M2-planes: M1 does have a vacancy gradient component, but we M2 patterning in our low-k materials is the main source of vacancies.  Hence, the mechanism is more apparent in the M2-plane structures, where there is a larger vacancy volume.

analysis to confirm this hypothesis, however, after such early stage void growth voiding will be very small.

D. Analytical modeling Based on this reasoning, we propose an addition to the  diffusion-creep model developed by McPherson and Dunn [10]. From figure 7, we see that:   2/1t*a=? , (1)  where ? is the drift/VIA and t is the stress time. If we now define a failure time TTF as   1/2  f TTF*a=? , (2)  where ?f is an arbitrary chosen failure criterion and we assume that this TTF is proportional to the voiding rate VR as defined in [10,11], we can rewrite the diffusion-creep model as follows:   ( ) ???  ? ???  ? ?  ?=? Tk EN B  a  eTTA 220 , (3) where N is the creep exponent, kB is Boltztman constant, Ea is the activation energy, T0 is the material stress free temperature and T is the storage temperature.

Adding an Arrhenius term to model the diffusion mechanism of region II, we get:  ( ) ? ? ?  ? ? ? ?  ? ? ? ? ?  ? ? ? ?  ? ?  +?=? Tk E  Tk E  N B  II a  B  I a  BeeTTA 2220 , (4) where EaI and EaII represent the activation energies of the diffusion mechanisms from region I and II, respectively. The fit of this model to the data presented in figure 3 is shown in figure 9 for the structure with the M1-plane (top) and for the structure with the M2-plane (bottom).

The activation energies in region I and II resulting from this fit are 0.9eV and 1.2eV, respectively. These values are in good agreement with literature values for interface and grain boundary diffusion [12]. Also, the fitted values of N (=2) and T0 (=225?C) are in good agreement with literature values [1].

The obtained activation energies support our hypotheses that the degradation mechanism dominating in region I is due to interface diffusion (section A), while the diffusion processes causing the drifts in region II are driven by grain boundary diffusion (section C).

The different peak locations for the M1- and M2-plane structures in region I are fitted well using our model. The peak is due to the interaction of the two co-existing mechanisms (stress gradient driven- & vacancy gradient driven-vacancy diffusion).  The peak occurs at different positions due to their interaction and can change position as one is more dominant in a given structure. Besides this, small differences in thermal treatments (M1 undergoes post-plating anneal of M2) and structural layouts (such as height, presence of VIA,? ) between M1- and M2-layers can result in different stress- and vacancy gradients in these two layers resulting in different peak locations.

E. Kelvin structure Compared to the structure with the M1-plane, the drift/VIA  of the Kelvin structure (figure 3) shows slower degradation in region I. The drift/VIA of this Kelvin is similar to the M2-plane structure in region II.

Based on our reasoning in section C, the behavior of the Kelvin structure in region II is to be expected: the drift in this region is due to vacancy movement in and above the VIA- region. For bigger M2-planes, more vacancies are present, leading to faster drifts.

The slower drift in region I of the Kelvin compared to the structure with the M1-plane is however a bit surprising: one would expect the drift of the Kelvin to be driven by M1- and   0.1  0.2  0.3  0.4  0.5  0.6  100 150 200 250 300 Temp (?C)  D rif  t/V IA  (O hm  )   0.1  0.2  0.3  0.4  D rif  t/V IA  (O hm  )  Diffusion-Creep model Arrhenius model Full model  M1-plane  M2-plane  Region I (0.9eV)  Region II (1.2eV)   Figure 9.

Both  the data on the structure with the M1-plane (top) and the M2-plane (bottom) are shown. Values of activation energies (0.9eV for  region I and  1.2eV for region II) are in good agreement with literature values for interface and grain bounday diffusion, respectively [12].

M2-plane effects, resulting in a faster drift than any of the other two structures. We argue that this is due to the symmetry of the structure (figure 10): the VIA in the Kelvin is both below and on top surrounded by big metal planes. This implies a stress on the VIA that is equal in all directions. This is different for the other two structures used in this study (figure 1): for these structures, the VIA?s are, at one end, connected to a metal line.

This metal line is in tensile stress and pulls the VIA to a certain extend in one preferred direction. This leads to higher stresses on the VIA compared to a symmetrical Kelvin structure which than leads to higher stress gradients, resulting in faster degradation.

This idea is further supported by our FE simulations.

Figure 11 shows the hydrostatic gradient under a VIA for  symmetrical and asymmetrical structures. The symmetrical structure shows significantly smaller stress gradients compared to the asymmetrical structure.



IV. CONCLUSIONS The early stages of the stress-induced-voiding mechanism  below and in VIA?s have been studied for interconnects integrated in a porous low-k material, using structures with M1- or M2-planes, respectively.  It was observed that below 225?C, a peak was present for both voiding mechanisms. The voiding below the VIA was more pronounced, but the voiding in the VIA was significant as well. FEM showed  much higher stress gradients present in the VIA for our materials compared to SiO2-based dielectrics. We attribute the significant voiding in the VIA to this gradient.  Above 225?C, we found a significant increase of the drift that was more pronounced for the M2-plane structures. By observing the lack of a temperature at which no drift occurred and using FEM, we argued that stress gradients alone could not be responsible for this shift. We attributed this shift to a vacancy gradient present in the VIA.

We proposed an addition to the model of McPherson and Dunn [10], where we add an Arrhenius term to the diffusion- creep model enabling the appropriate description of porous low-k integration schemes. We find a good match between the modified model and the data. A fitted activation energy of 0.9eV below 225?C supports interface diffusion in this region, while a fitted activation energy of 1.2eV supports the hypothesis of grain boundary diffusion in the temperature region above 225?C. We believe that performing SIV in this region do not allow a true study of the SIV-effect and that tests at lower temperatures are required when qualifying processes with respect to SIV.

Additionally, it is argued that VIA?s connected to the center of big metal plates above and below are less susceptible to SIV compared to VIA?s connected to line ends. Higher stress gradients are present in VIA?s asymmetrically connected to line ends making them more susceptible to SIV. We believe this need to be taken into account when qualifying processes with respect to SIV.
