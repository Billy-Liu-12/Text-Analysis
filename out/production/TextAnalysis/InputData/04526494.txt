Orbits Design for Remote Sensing Satellite M.A. Zayan, F. Eltohamy

Abstract This paper is conducted to design and determine satellite orbits for Earth observation missions, criteria for selecting orbits for remote-sensing satellites are considered.

Data provided by the analysis of satellite orbits used for earth studies are generalized. Circular quasi- geosynchronous, sun-synchronous, regular, and other orbits which permit regular coverage of the earth surface using detectors with constant parameters are considered, and requirements for such orbits are formulated. A general approach to the evaluation of the node periods of rotation and of orbital radius that meet those requirements is analyzed and discussed. The orbital configuration of a remote sensing satellite is designed to determine if baseline orbital parameters are appropriately specified to meet the mission goal. An algorithm is developed and implemented for remote sensing satellites orbits selection. A case study is chosen to verify, tune the results, and evaluate the performance.
