Fuzzy Galois connections for the extraction of temporal association  rules

Abstract- In this paper, we propose a new method able to correct errors the  dematerialization the documents, especially the  invoice document. We use on Electronic  document readers able to read and recognize the  relevant information.

The process consists on: digitizing an important  quantity of documents and passing them through  an electronic documents reader. Then treating  (correcting) the error recognition. The final  objective is to find an electronic document  reflecting all information included in the original  document (physical document).

To achieve this issue we develop a new parser  which is applicable to a large kind of documents,  especially correcting the detected errors. This  parser is based on the formal concept analysis,  Keywords: Documents dematerialization, electronic invoicing dematerialization, character automatic recognition, Formal Concept Analysis, Galois lattices, Fuzzy Set.



I. INTRODUCTION  Recently several researches and solutions have been proposed and developed to solve: recognition documents and errors detection.

Information and communication technologies represent considerable effects on how companies do business with their partners. In fact, these effects are based on electronic commerce (e-commerce) which is the purchase of products from suppliers (resp sales) to customers using the new information technologies. There are several models of e? commerce, namely , business-to-business, business? to-consumer, business-to-government.

However, Data Mining is defmed as "the non? trivial extraction of implicit, previously unknown, and potentially useful information from data". Not only does it include methods of extracting information from the given data, but also visualizing the information.

Mohammed RAMDANI  Department of computer System Faculty of sciences and technology  Mohammedia -Morocco - ramdani@fstm.ac.ma  The process of dematerialization consists on the transition from a phy sical document to an electronic document: structured document, semi-structured document and unstructured document, without human intervention [1]. This operation is carried out using an OCRl and an error processing method. In order to ensure a transparent transition without errors the error processing method is recommended.

Several injections of errors are due to various factors including printing quality [2], quality of the used paper, scanner resolution, software power (OCR)  [3], etc.

One of the major problems is to find a scalable  process for the learning phase, which should be used to correct errors of recognition. To address this problem some existing solutions have proposed in the literature. We categorize theme on two domains: the statistic approach and the probabilistic approach.

However, these solutions present many anomalies which will be detailed in the following sections. In this work we propose a new learning approach dedicate to correct errors of recognition based on the concept closed fuzzy .

This paper is organized as follows. Section II presents a description of the structural method.

Section III describes our proposition based on closed classical approach. Section IV presents our evolutionary method based on a closed fuzzy approach. Section V includes the discussions and critical. Section VI concludes this paper.



II. DESCRIPTION OF STRUCTURAL METHOD  The structure of document is a set of elements which are in relation to each other. However, the document is presented by multi-labeled graph  S = (N, LN, iN, LA, A) where : ? N is the set of nodes of the graph (structural  elements) .

? LN is the set of labels (labels) nodes ("content" elements) .

I : Optical character recognition.

? iN: N -7 LN is the function that associates to each node its label.

? LA is the set of labels of arcs ("names" relationships) and A is the set of arcs  (relationships between named elements)[4].

The following figure shows an example tree: N={paragraph, imag, Tabie,drawing ... ) LN ={Letter, number, word, ponctuation} LA = {include, compose .. .}  Fig 1: tree node paragraph.

We use previous structure (structural architecture) , to deduce the phy sical, logic and semantic structure. So, we consider an invoice - Fig 2 - as a multi-structured document, which content several structures in correlation between them.

The phy sical structure is the spatial distribution of several zones (text, images, tables, logos .... ) in the document. This structure is also an application from all areas document to the (x,y ) pair which presents the coordinates of the area. The logical structure is represented by a set of names, including for example: the client area, column area products, area company logo etc ..

The aim of The semantic structure is the meaning of areas, such us TTC area(price all taxes included) , area Quantity . . .

:i5-'.;J66S'J!I:J'!I  Fig 2 : the various structural document This architecture allows the detection of errors through various analy zers.

Fig 3 : Different parsers for detection errors The studied document (invoices) passes through  several parsers, each of them detects (and correct if possible) several kind of errors, especially lexical, sy ntactic, and semantic errors.

The results of this approach are encouraging, but many errors escape. Therefore we need to conceive a complementary method able to correct the remaining errors no detected by the structural method. The following section will propose a second method based on a semi-supervised learning.



III. CLOSED CLASSICAL CONCEPT APPROACH  A. Description of the concept windowing:  In order to solve the recognition errors, we have chosen a strategy based on data fragmentation according on chronological windows. The selected sampling follows a chronological order. The following diagram shows an example of sampling.

Window size = 100, Number of records = 1000.

Fig-4-Sampling process  B. Generation of association rules The next step is to extract association rules  specific to each sample, generally a rule can be written as: a -7 b i.e. b is recognized as a.

In comparing the samples selected to the phy sical  document -the original document-, we extract all the rules of each sample. The following figure shows the mechanism of extraction rules by window  fi 5 area - 19 -  c:::::::J11c:::::J  D ? ?  1c:::::::J  ? -< Q; "' 0 I  t "' = n Q.

III x m __ x __ - _____ x  Fig 5 : Video-encoding process To choose the appropriate rules to be applied in  each window, we based on closed concepts; the main goal is to find the chronological change of the rules. For example the rules R2 and R3 usually appear in the FI window, the same rules appear in F2 but they disappear in F3  The next section will detail the proposed approach based on the closed concept.

A. Classical closed concept : 1. Classical Galois connection  Let R be a binary relation defined on D x T. The triple (D, T, R) defines a formal context. For two sets A and B such that A ? D, B ? T, the classical  Galois connections f and h are defined as follows: f (A) = {t E T I If d E A d (t, d) E R} h (B) = {d E D I 1ft E B, (t, d) E R} The composition of the two operators f and h,- i.e.

foh- defined the closure of the Galois connection,  that mean if A is a subset of T, A and f (A) are closures if and only if hof (A) = A.

The following figure illustrates the use of the classical Galois connection:  h(6} f{A}  B; Se l of rules  Fig-6-The classical Galois connection  2. Adaptation of Galois connection :  In order to generate all closed concepts regrouping windows and rules, we use all the possible closures [6].

For a given area, we have: FI has the following rules: (R/)'?I .kl F2 has the following rules: (R/)i?1 .k2  Generally we have: Fj has the following rules: (R()i?1 .k) For a subset A of all the windows such that A ?:r where f={F,J'?/r  f(A)={R, E RI If FliEA Fll 15 R,J Fll 15 Ri means { R, E { R/'j j?/ ku} f(A) gives the image of the subset of windows A, which is a set of rules noted Reg.

Then we generate the Reg Set such that Reg= (R'}i?/k tel que Supp(R? E} where ? denotes a predetermined threshold  While h(Reg) is defined as follows: h(Reg)={ Fll E fl IfREReg Fu 15 R} h(Reg)={ Fli E f tq Fli 15 R} Fli 0 R iff Maxi?/HnCP(RJP(RJ IF ))=P(R)P(RI F,J (1) P(R) : the probability of the rule R) in all windows.

P(R/F): the probability of the rule Rj in the window Fj.

h(Reg) gives the image of a set of rules Reg, which is a set of windows, A and R form a closed classical concept iff h if (A)) = A.

To explain the problems found during the application of classical concepts closed, we illustrate the following example:     R,  11 0 ? I . " tt{-: R2 F,  J ? F,  R3  F2 F3  , ? F2 F3  ? ?  ? 6 ? ? 4= F, F2 F3  Fig 7: Distribution rules in windows The various curves above give the following table:  Tab-1- statistical of distributions the rules  Considering the subsetA={ Fj, F2}, we get f(A)={ Rj , R2}, let's find h({ Rj , R2})' We apply the proposed involvement in (1) : For RJ: Rep(Rj) 7Rep(Rj, Fj) ?:> 0,470,3 = 0,12 Rep(Rj) 7Rep(Rj, F2) ?:> 0,470,5 = 0,2 Rep(Rj) 7Rep(Rj, F3) ?:> 0,470,2 = 0,08 We take the maximal value, so F2 will be retained.

For R2: Rep(R2) 7Rep(R2' F,) ?:> 0,370,3 = 0,09 Rep(R2) 7Rep(R2' F2) ?:> 0,370,7 = 0,21 Rep(R2) 7Rep(R2' F3) ?:> 0,370 = ? So F2 will be retained.

The concept {{Fj,F2}, {Rj,R2}} isn't a closed concept, we note that F, has been marginalized even though it has an acceptable rate of representation in both rules including Fj et F2? However, the next section will present the solution to this problem, as a fuzzy approach.



IV. CLOSED FUZZY CONCEPT APPROACH  Jaoua and al. Numarti [7] propose new  definitions for the operators f and h of fuzzy Galois connection and a new form for the fuzzy formal concept. They believe that only the intention of fuzzy formal concept is represented by a fuzzy set.

To adapt these definitions to the context of knowledge extraction, we redefine operators fuzzy  Galois connection f and h, considering the fuzzy  formal context textual f 0 h defined as follows:  A. Definitions  (F,R"re/) [8];  The triple (f, :R ,rei) defines a fuzzy formal context textual, such as F describes all windows, :R the set of rules to be applied and a binary relation  reI fuzzy setf X :R.

For a set of window A of f such that A? f  and set of rules R of :R, the operators of the fuzzy  Galois connection and I et he are formulated as: [9.10] :  We define: The fuzzy quantifier J1rel [11,12] as follows:  f, F,  We also define:  f, f.

I(A) = {Rj E RI min (J1rel(Rjl Fi)) FiEA + max (J1rel(Rjl Fi)) > E}  FiEA This means that the retained rules must have an average degree of membership greater than a constant c.

I(A) gives the image of the subset of windows, which is a set of rules noted Re.

he(Re) = {fen E F I 'ltR  E Rei (J1rel(R) [[laue ) ? J1rel(R,fen) > e)}  This means that retained windows must verify the  inequality. (J1rel(R) ? J1rel(R,fen)) > e, Where:  ? J1rel (R) is the degree oj membership oj R in all windows.

So Fj will be retained.

For F2 We have I1rel(Rj )=0.4 , I1rel(R2 )=0.3 et I1rel(R3 )=0.2 I1rel(Rj, F2)=0.5 ; I1rel(R2, F2)=0. 7; I1rel(R3, F2)=0.5 ; min(1,l-O .4+0.5)=1 min(1, 1-0 .3+0.7)=1 min(1,l-O .2+0.5)=1  ? So F2 will be retained.

For F3 We have I1rel (Rj )=0.4 , I1rel (R2 )=0.3 et I1rel (R3 )=0.2 I1rel(Rj, F3)=0.2 ; I1rel(R2, F3)=0; I1rel(R3, F3)=0.1 ; min(1, 1-0 .4+0.2)=0.8 min(1,l-O .3+0)=0.7 min(1,l-O .2+0.1)=0.9  ? So F3 will not be retained Then we can deduce that the sets {Rj, R2, R3} and {Fj, F2} form a fuzzy closed concept.



V. DISCUSSION AND CRITICALS  In this work, we have proposed a comparative study of two approaches; the first one uses classical clustering concepts, while the second uses a fuzzy versIOn.

In fact, the classical approach selects the rules by the thresholding mechanism, the setting of a bad threshold we may eliminate or retained the rules.

The second approach uses an average membership degrees using a fuzzy quantifier.

On the other hand, especially in the opposite direction i.e.- find all windows from the set of rules - the classical method uses a simple probabilistic estimation. The second approach adopts a fuzzy implication between the degree of membership of the rule in all windows and the degree of membership in the window.

However, the second approach is convincing because it keeps all the chances for a rule or window to be maintained. The first is able to marginalize components (rule or window) at any time. The results show an acceptable rate of learning errors, and especially suggest an adequate correction of errors.

The following table shows the results: Starting conditions: 1000 records and 10 windows  which of them has 100 records.

VI. CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTTVS  In this paper, we propose to solve a problems related on the extraction of rules in chronological order by using the paradigm of Galois especially ; the fuzzy closing Galois connection. This concept has allowed us to find an acceptable least the rule to apply in a set of data. We also presented the results of our prototype as a set of rules by windows.

As perspective of this research, we propose to integrate the Galois lattice technique. This technique allows associating each set of windows to a set of rules as a graph with multiple paths.
