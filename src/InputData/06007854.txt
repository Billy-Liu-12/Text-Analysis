Abstract?Dr. Soetomo General Hospital already has a Hospital Information System which has been computerized for data storage of each recapitulated patient's disease. Since data recapitulated the patient's disease is increasing, Dr. Soetomo Hospital needed an application which can provide information for decision makers. One application that can help in decision making is data mining. Data mining with hybrid-dimension association rules method where the method to analyze the relationship between disease with patient identity. This method is made using apriori algorithm. Hybrid dimension association rules is a multidimensional association rule that allow the repetition of the predicate on each rules. This method is very suitable to describe the rules of the relationship with the patient's disease and patient's identity. Data that has been prepared is processed by the algorithm to generate frequent itemset so that will produce hybrid dimension association rules and the rules displayed by form of tables and graphs. The implementation of the algorithm is using Java Netbeans 6.5 software and Oracle 10g. By using the output of this application is in the form of association rules and charts, decision makers can know the relationship between the patient's disease with the patient?s identity such as gender, status, domicile, education and occupation with other diseases.

I. INTRODUCTION Dr. Soetomo is a top class general hospital in eastern  Indonesia. Dr. Soetomo has a Hospital Information System (SIRS) which is computerized by using the Oracle database and Oracle Developer for its application. One of the outputs of the system is a recapitulation of the patient's disease. Dr.

Soetomo requires software that is used as a tool that can provide useful knowledge for doctors and medical students to analyze the track record of disease to enable them to take further action.

Since the increasing number of patients with a variety of different illnesses, Dr. Soetomo need to know what steps can be taken in dealing with these problems. Therefore, the presence of historical data can provide information about patient?s historical diseases. From the existing data, data mining can create a relationship between a disease with some attributes which are owned by the patient such as sex, area of residence, and work with other diseases in patients by using Hybrid-Dimension Association Rules.



II. HYBRID DIMENSION ASSOCIATION RULES Multidimensional association rules is a rules that involve  more than one dimension or predicate (such as rules that connect between what the customer purchased (buys) by customer age (age)). Purchases data from database and related information are stored in a relational database. The stored data are essentially multidimensional. (Jiawei & Kamber, 2001, p.251).

Hybrid-dimension association rule association rules is composed of two or more dimension or predicate and its predicate can happen over and over again in a single rule that is known as repeated predicated.

Example of Hybrid-dimension association rules, are:  Age (X, "20 ... 29") ^ Buys (X, "laptop ") => Buys (X, "b / w printer") [Support = 2%, Confidence = 60%] Rule above consists of two predicates of age and buys,  with repetition of the predicate buys. These relationships describe that 2% of customers are aged 20 to 29 years. There is a 60% chance that the buyer in this age while buy a laptop also purchase a printer.

The attribute database can be an absolute / definite or quantitative. Absolute attribute is an attribute that has no value (eg: work, brands, and colors). Absolute attribute is also called the nominal attribute; the value is the name of something. Quantitative attribute is an attribute that has value (eg: age, income, prices).



III. DATA MINING PROCESS The sequences of the implementation system are:  A. Preprocessing Process Process of transform the transaction data into a ready  data-mining. The changed data are disease data with all the patient?s attributes. Input: transaction date, tables name, patients? tables, diagnosis tables, and icd_x (disease coding) tables. Output: create table confirmation, conversion confirmation, conversion table results.

B. Frequent Itemsets Generate Process The process of searching for the couple items those often  appear simultaneously in the whole transaction. User is asked to input the minimum support and patient?s attributes.

Data on the selected table is filtered then sought his support,       one by one, the items that support is less than the minimum support at delete and the item that exceeds the minimum support is stored in an array then the array is still a 1-itemsets are processed in the join process. Join the process repeated until no more itemset that can be combined. Flowchart generate frequent itemsets can be seen in Figure 3.10.

Input: patients? attribute, frequent itemset generate, minimum support, conversion table results. Output: generate frequent itemset process confirmation, frequent itemset data.

C. Process Generate Association Rules: Process of form an association rules. Input: frequent  itemset table, association rules generate, the minimum confidence. Output: rules process confirmation, data association rules information.



IV. IMPLEMENTATION The results from the application of the relationship or  association between the data of patients with the disease described by using a hybrid method dimension association rules can be seen at Figure 2. There are two or more dimensions or predicate and predicate repetition as shown in rule No. 77.

Status (B) ^ disease (volume depletion) => disease (diarrhea and gastroenteritis of presumed infectious origin).

In these rules there are two predicate that is the status and disease, where there is repetition of the predicate disease.

These relationships using a sample of patients, 6% of them have the status of unmarried and 100% of patients with this status if you suffer from volume depletion also suffered from diarrhea and gastroenteritis of presumed infectious origin. In other words, if the patient has an unmarried status and suffer from volume depletion, then 6% possibility of the patient to suffer from diarrhea and gastroenteritis of presumed infectious origin.

From Table I and Figure 1 can be seen that the more attributes of patients are used, the longer time process required. Large number of transactions does not affect the processing time because it depends on the number of itemset that contain elements of the disease.

V. CONCLUSION Mining result is to display the correlation between data  (association rules) along with information on support and confidence that can be analyzed. Information provides additional considerations for the user in decision making further. Applications can process data recapitulation of the patients at Dr. Soetomo to find frequent itemset that meets the minimum support and generate Dimension Hybrid Association Rules. If the specified minimum support smaller and patient attributes that are used more and more the more itemset generated and the longer processing time, and vice versa. If the specified minimum confidence that the smaller the more rules are generated, and vice versa.
