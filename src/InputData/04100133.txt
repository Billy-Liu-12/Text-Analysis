The Blondie25 Chess Program Competes Against Fritz 8.0 and a Human Chess Master

Abstract- Previous research on the use of coevolution to improve a baseline chess program demonstrated a Blondie25 is the result of 7462 generations of evolution in performance rating of 2650 against Pocket Fritz 2.0 self-play in which the static board evaluator was evolved, based on 16 games played (13 wins, 0 losses, 3 draws). including material values, positional values, and three The resultant program, named Blondie25, did not use object neural networks (front, back, and center of the any rules for managing the time allocated per move; it chessboard). Moves are selected based on minimax with simply used three minutes on each move. Heuristics to alpha-beta pruning. Readers interested in background on more effectively manage time were developed by trial the development of the program should review [11]. One and error, play testing against Fritz 8.0. The best of the limitations of the Blondie25 program is that it has heuristics discovered were different for black and not evolved (because it has not been allowed to evolve) white. The results of 12 games played on each side the use of time per move as a facet of play. Instead, it has were 1 win, 4 losses, and 7 draws for black, and 2 devoted an equal amount of time for each move, wins, 6 losses, and 4 draws for white. Fritz 8.0 is rated regardless of the current situation or history of moves. For currently at 2752 (?20) on SSDF (the acronym for the tournament conditions, three minutes per move have been Swedish Chess Computer Association), placing it as used.

The results are the first case using time more effectively. Performance was judged on of an evolved chess program defeating a world-class competitions with Fritz 8.0, a highly rated chess program chess program (three times). The performance rating that was in the top five of all chess programs rated on [12] for Blondie25 against Fritz 8.0 was 2635.33, which at the time of our testing. Fritz 8.0 is currently ranked as compares well with the previous performance rating the 11 th best program in the world.

In four games, Blondie25 won management in Fritz 8.0, while also taking into account three and lost one. whether or not a move made by Fritz 8.0 was anticipated.

Anticipated moves suggest that prior searching was effective in gaining insight into future play; unanticipated moves suggest that more time may be required to search a  1 Introduction and Background branch of the game tree that was not appreciated.

As noted in [I], chess has served as a testing ground for 2 Heuristics for Time Management efforts in artificial intelligence, both in terms of computers playing against other computers, and Experimentation in 153 games (some of which crashed computers playing against humans for more than 50 years mid-play) yielded two different sets of heuristics for time [2-9]. management for Blondie25 playing black or white.' It  may be helpful to recall that 120 minutes are allocated for This paper reports on progress in testing the self-learning the first 40 moves (first time period), 60 minutes are evolutionary chess program, named Blondie25. (A similar allocated for the next 20 moves (second time period), and protocol for learning to play checkers was named 30 minutes are allocated for all remaining moves.

Results reported in [11] indicated that _______________ the evolved program earned a 16-game performance lDuring this experimentation, it was verified that rating of 2650 against Pocket Fritz 2.0, rated between allowing Blondie25 to use a constant time per move 2300-2350, with 13 wins, 0 losses, and 3 draws. resulted in poor performance against Fritz 8.0.

Using following algorithm, where Ft is the amount of time used less time than Fritz 8.0 used when Fritz 8.0's move was by Fritz 8.0 on the previous move and x is Blondie25's anticipated assisted in saving time for situations that were time: unanticipated. In such situations, the longer that Fritz 8.0  used to find its move suggests a deeper required search.

Normally White will try to attack 16.Bd4 Nbd7 [16...g5 is a little more to the point after Black's king with a combination of pawns and pieces.

There is no clear way to Quon, Jim - Blondie 1E481 break through Black's wall without the help of pawns.

(Game 3) 17..Qb7? This plan to attack along the b-file is too slow E48: Nimzo-lndian: Rubinstein: 5 Bd3 d5 including 6 and goes nowhere. Better is: [1 7...............Rac81 8.Qh4 Nc4 Ne2, but excluding 6 a3.
