Talking in the Zoonivevse: A Col!oborative Tool for Citizen Scientists  Lucy Fortson School of Physics and Astronomy  University of hhnesota hhneapolis, hfN USA  fortson@physics.umn.edu  EXTENDED ABSTRACT  S W L y n n Citizen Science Department  Adler Planetarium Chicago, IL USA  stuart@zooniverse.org  Researchers in fields as diverse zls astrophysics, ecology and papyrology face a common problem: as the size and complexity of digital datasets increases dramatically, new strategies in computational thinking are needed to transform data into knowledge. Virtual Citizen Science (VCS), a form of collaborative research involving the general public as volunteers in odine reporting or analysis of data [I], has proven to be one successful approach to solving this Big Data problem. In particdar, the Zooniverse.al-g platform for citizen science has provided a unique crowdsourcing solution for these challenges across a wide range of disciplines by harnessing t!he visual processing capabilities of over a million volunteers and asking them to make observations on data sets of complex objects presented in online interfaces.

Crucial for the success of a Zoonavw,se ci t izm4aed project is maximizing human attention on the primary task1 - both in terms of quantity and quality of output data. There are several avenues of research that descxib efforts in developing algorithms to model e.g. the accuracy of a given volunteer such as reported in [2,3] or the completion of a particular task as described in [4,5]. These sorts of efforts will culminate in the capability of the Zooniverse platform to dynamically push interventions to individual volunteers to maximize quantity and quality of volunteer-processed data. At the same time, we must ackmowledge that the so-called ''human-pr~essing unit" (HPU) is indeed a human volunteer, requiring an understanding of the motivations that keep these individuals engaged in a project. Recent work on V h l  Citizen Science (VCS) activities and the inotivations of VCS participants suggests that the primary motivation is "to contribute to real research" [6-91.

While an understanding of motivation at this general  participatian level is important, it is necessary to build models for understanding the motivational response to specifiE interventions geared towards lnaxirnizing human attention. For example, it may be that in determining that Pmticipant A is most accurate at a particularly difficult task (say identiEying hint galaxies), by dynamically serving only those difficult tasks to Pltrticlpant A, we inadvertently drive them offthe site.

Therefore, somewhat counter-intuitively, the dgoritlm for maximizing primary task output must take into account non- primary task engagement factors. What engages t l~e  individual is g o d  for the overdl health and success of the project.

One of these critical HPU engagement factors is the ability ofthe volunteers to communicate amongst themselves and with project researchers in dynamically d e h e d  communities.

These communications facilitate the introduction of inexperienced volunteers to the primary task as  well as provide a mechanism for volunteers to collect and discuss interesting objects that they have classified. To this end, the Zooniverse team has developed t!he "Talk" tool, an odine object-oriented data collection and discussion tool launched as an integral part of any Zooniverse project since 201 0. Details of the Talk tool are provided in [9] including a study across ten Zooniverse projects evaluating correlations between activity on primary task and the Talk tool with both dislxibutions folbwing the classic "Perato" power-law distribution for volunteerism [lo].

This study also shows the average "lifespan" of Talk threads with the longest at 400 days for the Plmebhunters.o~g project while the shortest is 13 days for the Worm~wtch.org project.

This Talk tool d l  be the main topic of my presentation.

I will focus on our experience with the Galaxy Zoo 1 fonun as both a case study in how exhaordinary serendipitous discoveries can happen when the general public is involved in real research as well as a case study in why a linear forurn as a collaboration tool is a hindrance to knowledge discovery within a VCS.

I will then descrik the Talk tool, reporting on its use across multiple Zooniverse projects and describ several case studies involving the importance of the Talk tool in generating volunteer-initiated discovaies. Finally, I will report on investigatiom of the use of Talk during the critical launch phase of Zmniverse projects as a means of communication between the project team and vololumteers; and discuss potential implications of these communications in engaging the volunteers and as a key indicator of success for a project.

Fortson is a member of the VERITAS and CTA very-high- energy gamma-ray astronomy collaborations. studying Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) using multi-wavelen_& observations to determine the source of gamma-ray emission from AGN.

Through her work with the Galaxy Zoo science team, she is studring the evolution of the AGN host galaxies. In addition to her work in astrophysics, Dr. Fortson is also deeply committed to improving the science literacy of d l  Americans through her role on the Executive Committee of the Citizen Science Alliance and the Zooniverse project (m.zooniverse.org). Prior to the Zooniverse, Dr. Eortson worked with other collaborative technologies (e.g .

Northwestern University's The Collaboratory Project and FermiLabs QuarkNet Project) to bring collaborative research into the classroom. Before joining the faculty at UMN in 201 0.

Dr. Fortson was the Vice President for Research at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago where she held a joint research position at the University of Chicago. Dr. Eortson graduated with a BA in Physics and Astronomy from Smith College and received her Ph.D. from UCLA in High Energy Physics. She has served on numerous local and national committees including the National Academy of Sciences Astronomy 2010 Decade1 Survey, the Astrophysics Science Subcommittee and the Human Capital Committee of the NASA Advisory Council (NAC), the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate Advisoy Committee (ME'SAC) for the National Science Foundation and the Education and Public Outreach Review Committee for the National Optical Astronomy Observatory.

STUART LYNN Based in the Citizen Science Department of the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, Dr. Stuart Lynn is the Technical Lead of the Zooniverse. He is the PI on an NSF Social Computing Systems (SOCS) pant tasked with exploring how machine learning and human computation can be better integrated do increase the efficiency and accuracy of citizen science projects. In addition he is PI on an NEH grant aimed at producing an open source transcription hmework.

After obtaining a PhD in Astrophysics from Edinburgh University, Dr. Lynn joined the Zooniverse team at Oxford University as a postdoc and developer in 2010 where in 20 11 he received a James Martin Fellowship to further the work of the Zooniverse. Dr. Lynn was the lead developer on the Oldweather and Planet Hunters projects which have made substantial contributions to climate modeling and exoplanet discovery.
