Abstract: This paper discusses the current status of the research  about mining association rules in a database, which points out the shortcoming of classical Apriori's algorithm, and presents some theorems of mining association rules based on reducing records in a larger database. It also applies the theory of fuzzy sets to processing fuzzy data of Traps in a network management. According to those theorems and the theory of fuzzy sets, we have designed the AprioriFuzzy algorithm to mine fuzzy association rules in database. Through the performance of AprioriFuzzy algorithm is analyzed and evaluated in this paper, this algorithm can save mining time about 30% and can mine fuzzy association rules in fuzzy data effectively. It has been implemented on PC in Visual C++6.0 and has been applied to mine the Trap's information in the network management based on SNMP protocol.

frequent items sets. The major shortcomings of this algorithm are:  0 Scanning the transactional database repeatedly. The efficient of the algorithm is very low when database is a very larger.

0 The utilization of non-frequent item sets in data mining is inefficient.

0 Be short of ability of processing fuzzy data.

Because of these reasons, the efficiency (time and  space) and application of this algorithm is limited seriously.

In this paper, we present an improved algorithm based on the database reducing and hzzy sets. It can reduce the searching space and improve the efficiency of data mining.

It can also mine fuzzy association rules in database.

This algorithm has been implemented on PC in Visual C++6.0:   Keywords:  management; Transactional database Data mining; Association rule; Fuzzy sets: Network  The Basic of Mining Fuzzy Association Rules  1 Introduction  The Knowledge Discovery in Database, which is called KDD for short, is a new manner for discovery potential knowledge and provisional knowledge from a larger database. It is consists of 7 parts: data cleaning, data integration, data selection, data transformation, data mining, data evaluation and knowledge representation. The data mining is a primary part in KDD. Among the many successful manners, theories and tools in data mining, the association rule is a very important Data Mining Model (DMM).

The association rule was presented firstly by R.Agrawa1 in 1993[1]. It was used to mine association rules in the customer transactional database, and to discover relationship between the different items. The nucleus of R.Agrawal's method is a classical Apriori algorithm. It can find out frequent item sets in the power set on the principle of statistics. This algorithm can be divided into two parts.

First, Apriori algorithm searches frequent item sets in database; the next is to create association rules from those  Let I={i,,i2 ,..., i,} be a set of items, then DB={ < Tid, PI TGI}  is a transactional database, where Tid is an identifier which be associated with each transaction. Let Attr={a,, a ,  ,..., am}is  a set of attributes of database.

According to fuzzy conception, we can describe these attributes as {f I ,fl ,. . .,f, } using hzzy sets theory. For any tuple t=<tl,t2 ,..., t m >  in database DB, the fuzzy tuple is <U/, [t ,], uf2  [t , I  ,..., u , ~  [t ,I>, where U is a degree of subordinate of f k .  In the last part, if f , ( l b j G m )  is a hzzy conception, the t , is a element of t and a degree of subordinate to fuzzy conception f ,  ,then we called X > Y as fuzzy association rule, where X c I, Y c I, and X n Y= 4 . Given X={f , f ,..., f }, a degree which transaction t belong to X is uJ (t):  u (t)=min( t , t ,. . ., t } The average value that all transactions in database  0-7803-7865-2/03/$17.00 02003 IEEE     Tid Ageis Gender  belong to X is called the support of X. That is SuPPort(X)=  If the support of X is greater than or equals to minsup, then X is called the frequent item set, otherwise X is called non-frequent item set, where X c I and the minsup are the smallest support. The support and confidence of a fuzzy association rule are  U, ( t )  / I DB 1 teDB  Suppoer(X 3 Y)= Support(X U Y) Confidence(X Y)= Support(X U Y)/Support(X) The association rule with the smallest support and the  smallest confidence is called the strong association rule.

Theorem 1: Supposed Y c T  and XsY. If Y is a  frequent itemset, then X must be a frequent itemset.

Proof: Let R={r,, r 2 ,  . . ., r k  }. R is a frequent itemset.

According to the definition above, we can get Support(R)= c U R  (t) / I DB I 2minsup  teDB  Given S={rp, r r  ,..., r w } ( l d p ,  q ,..., w b k )  is a subset of R and R f  4 .  According to the definition of support, we can get  Support(S)= c U, (t) / I DB I t sDB  If t is an uninhibited transaction, the degree which t belongs to R and S are  U R  (t)=min{t[r,I,t[r*l, . . .Ark  I 1 us  (t)=min{t[r I, t[rq I,. . ., t[r 11 ?.* S E R .?- {t[rpl,t[rq I,. ..,t[rwl) c {t[r,I,t[r,l ,..., t[rk 1 1 For any transaction t, the minimum m can be  m E  M r ,  I,. . .,t[r, 11 or m E ( 0 ,  I m ,  I,. . ., t[r4 1 M r ,  l,t[rq I,. . . ,t[r 11 e*. us(t)?, UR(t), C U s ( t ) >  X U & )  t s D B  t s D B  .?. Support(S) 3Support(L) 3minsup Therefore, S must be a frequent set. W Before mining fuzzy association rules, we must  process all tuples of the database and induct fuzzy conception about attributes. All values of database can be divided into 4 types:  Consecutive numeric: Such as age, salary, connect time of network, etc. After scanning all databases, we can get u(x) from Max value and Min value of attribute. The u(x) is  x - min max-x .

max- min max- min ?  u(x)= or u(x)=  Degree Salary  0 Discrete numeric: For example, the temperature of CPU can be divided into Too-High, High, Middle, Low and Too-Low. For the temperature of CPU is Too-High, the fuzzy conception can be indicated by 1.0, 0.75, 0.5, 0.25, 0 respectively;  Character: Such as the degree of education, the name of the sub-network, etc. can be processed by the manner of discrete numeric;  0 Logical type: Such as the connection and disconnection of network, gender of Human, etc. Because this type has two values, we can use 1 to represent one value and 0 to represent another one. For example, the fuzzy conception that the gender is male can be indicated by 1 for male and by 0 for female.

Table 1. The normal database  5001 0.21 0.76) 0.181 Using conceptions about fuzzy theory, we can convert  uninhibited database into a fuzzy database and can use AprioriFuzzy algorithm mining fuzzy association rules. For example, we can convert the database in table 1 into the fuzzy database in table 2. i  3 Basic Conception of Reducing Database  Our purpose is to make a search for strong association rules in a transactional database. The classical algorithms can mine these rules by scanning DB repeatedly. Its efficiency is very low when the DB is a huge database.

Analyzing the process of mining rules, we find out many properties of transactions. By means of those properties, we      can delete many transactions from DB. Those properties, included property of Apriori[2][3], can be described as below:  Theorem 2: Given Y c T  and X c Y .  If X are a non-frequent itemset, then Y muse be a non-frequent itemset.

Proof: This theorem can be proved using disproof.

Suppose Y is a frequent itemset, that is  support(^)= C U,, (t> / I DB I amincount Because X c Y ,  X must be a frequent itemset by  theorem 1.This is a contradictory with the condition of theorem 2. Therefore, if X isn't a frequent itemset, Y must be non-frequent itemsets.

Theorem 3: Suppose we have got L k ,  and L k  is a frequent k-itemset. After mining L , we can delete transaction T from database if T E I and ITI=k.

Proof: The conclusion can be found obviously.

Because T (ITI=k) isn't included in C (i>k), the transaction T is not used for data mining when i is greater than k.

Therefore, we can delete T from the database.

Theorem 4: Suppose Y 5: T, X E Y, and IYI=IXI+l. If X is a non-frequent itemset, Y is also a non-frequent itemset.

And it can be deleted.

tsDB  Proof: The proof can be divided into two steps.

First, Y is a non-frequent itemset by theorem 2. Next,  we can prove that Y does not have any unknown frequent itemsets. Suppose X={trl,tlZ ,..., t r k }  and IXI=k. We can get Y=X U {t,m} , where {t,m} is any set, IYI=k+l. The k-itemsets of Y are:  {til 9 t ,2? ' '  ' 9 t,k}9 > t,2 9 ''. 2 t,k-l 9 t,,}, { t t l >  ti2Y ' . ' 9  t , k - 2 ,  tik 9 t fm}9 ". > { t , 2 ,  t r 3 9  t , k >  t , n i } Because the support of Y's subsets has been known in  mining L , Y does not have any unknown subsets.

Therefore, we can delete itemset Y and its subsets from database. H  Theorem 5 : Let X c T, Y c T and X fl Y= 4 ,  where IYI=2 and 1x122. If X and Y are non-frequent, XUY and its subsets can be deleted form database.

Proof: .*. X U Y is a non-frequent itemsets by theorem 2.

Let X={tml,tm2,...,tmk} and Y={tnl,tn2}, where IX(=k  '.* X and Y are non-frequent itemsets.

( k 2 2 )  and IYI=2. We can get '= { f m l ,  t m ,  3 " *  > tmk I t , ,  2 t , 2 }  Where IX U YI=k+2. The k+l-itemsets of X U Y are:  { tml  , t m 2  >."9tmk , tnl  }? { tml  Ytm2 , " . , t m k  > t n 2  1, {t,l J m 2  , * . . r t m k - l  ,tnl , t " 2  1, f t m l  , tm2 3'*'9tmk-2 9tmk 7 t n l  > t n 2 } ?

The k-itemsets of X U Y are known after X has been mined; Therefore X U Y and its subsets can be deleted from database. W  These theorems are the foundation of creating a new algorithm.

4 The Algorithm of Mining Fuzzy Association Rules  Because Apriori algorithm scan database repeatedly, its efficiency is very low. In order to improve mining efficiency and enlarger fields of its application, some scholars had put forward some new algorithms recently. For example, Savaseres etc [4] has designed the algorithm based on Divides, Parks etc [5 ]  has put forward the algorithm of the Hash, Toivonen etc [6]  has designed the algorithm based on Sampling. In this paper, we have put forward an algorithm by reducing redundancy records of database and fuzzy sets. This algorithm can be divided into two parts:  0 Find all frequent itemsets; 0 Generate strong association rules from the frequent  itemsets.

Because second part is simpler than first one, we only  give the AprioriFuzzy algorithm to find all frequent itemsets. The AprioriFuzzy algorithm is listed as below:  Algorithm: AprioriFuzzy Input: DB, minsup Output: Result Result:={ } k:=l; C = { 1-itemsets} While(C ) do {  Created a counter for all itemsets; for (i=l;i<=IDBl;i++) {  if I T, I=k-l, T, can be deleted from database; if(X c ske1, T, E DB,I T, I=k+l, T, -X E s, ), r, can be deleted;  if( c DB,X sk-1  9 1  T, I-lxl=O), T, can be deleted;  for all C E  ck do { if(r, GDB, r, c c,)       {fora l lcEc ,  do{ for all T,. c DB do { ~,.counter+=min{t[c,] ,  t[c,], ..., t[c,] }  T ~ .  counter =q .counter//DBI; > > I >  L,  ={tl t E c, and t.counter3minsup); s, ={tl t E c, and t.counter<minsup); If (k==2) s,=s,; The support degree of L, has no change; Result: = Result U L, k=k+ 1 ;  I Where ck is candidate k-itemsets, T, is i-th record of  database, s, is non-frequent k-itemsets, s, is non-frequent 2-itemsets.

\  5 The Algorithm Performance Analysis and Evaluation  The algorithm AprioriFuzzy can find all frequent itemsets and reduce database with non-frequent itemsets.

Suppose:  0 The number of records is n 0 The minimum support degree is s 0 The algorithm finished after circulation k times 0 Average cardinal number of candidate items is p 0 Average cardinal number of non-frequent itemsets is  0 Average cardinal number of frequent itemsets is I 0 Average number of records reduced is r.

m  When we use AprioriFuzzy to mine fuzzy association rules , the complexity of time is:  i = l  i = l  L  This formula includes 3 parts. The first part is the complexity of time of scanning itemsets, the next is the complexity of time of reducing database with non-fi-equent itemsets, and the last one is the time complexity of creating candidate k-itemsets. If we mine the same database with Apriori, the time complexity is  Comparing formula 0 with formula 0, we can get the relation formula about n, k, r, 1 and m. If n is less than kr( 1 +I/m), the efficiency of algorithm AprioriFuzzy is much higher than algorithm Apriori's. Obviously, algorithm AprioriFuzzy can effectively reduce records and UO's frequency when r is a very large number. It can also load  the fairly large database into memory. This algorithm has been used in fault diagnosis expert system of network.

Reducing database by AprioriFuzzy Figure 1 shows that the AprioriFuzzy algorithm is  more efficient than Apriori in mining 10 databases. The horizontal axle shows 10 different databases and the vertical axle shows the time of mining (the unit is second).

Figure 2 shows mining of a database with 10000 records by the AprioriFuzzy with different minimum support, The vertical axle shows the number of reducing numbers of records in the same database. The horizontal axle shows 10 different minimum supports (in percentage).

Generally, the efficiency of AprioriFuzzy is superior to the Apriori,(showed in figure 1). The bigger the parameter r is, the better result we get. The efiiciency of algorithm is also related to record structure and record number. The relationship between s and record number n is demonstrated on the figbre 2. In fact, AprioriFuzzy's efficiency is connected not only with parameters above, but also with the      structure of transaction database and the opportunity of Conference on Very Large Database: 1-12, Bombay, reducing the database. If the algorithm can reduce records India, 1996 in the beginning loops, it can gain a very good result in the [7] Timothy J. Ross.

Xi?an: Publishing House of Xi?an jiaotong  University, July 199 1 In this paper, we analyze the algorithm of mining  association rules according to the property of frequent itemsets and transactional database. We also set forth 3 theorems of reducing the database and put forward the AprioriFuuzy algorithm that can mine fuzzy association rule in transactional database. In our test, the algorithm AprioriFuzzy is superior to the classical algorithm when transactional database can be reduced. According to the running results of the algorithm, the efficiency of mining is directly connected with the structure of record. In case of database reducing records nature getting into worse, that is, it does not satisfythe condition in theorems, the efficiency of AprioriFuzzy descend quickly. Therefore, we still need to improve algorithm AprioriFuzzy in the fbture.
