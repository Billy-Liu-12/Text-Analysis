Abstract - Image retrieval models based on visual technique focuses on altering relevance importance in terms perception have traditionally placed more emphasis on object of user's current queries with respect to previous retrieved shape than other image features. Indexing and retrieval information. Numerous approaches based on statistics or techniques are two major concerns for efficient management of machine learning can approximate the users' queries [7-10].

In this paper, a new shape-based image The relevance feedback scheme plays an important role in retrieval model coupled with grey theory, a fuzzy hashing table and relevance feedback based on association rules is proposed improving the retrseval accuracy as It allows users to express to search for images with similar object shape. A GM(1,N) their image search requests. Two common approaches are model is used for the shape-based image retrieval. Next, a fuzzy used for relevance feedback.

The proposed strategy is applied to the FISH dataset estimates the distribution of relevant images, and then moves to demonstrate its effectiveness. the query toward the most similar image [13-14].

The relevance feedback technique allows users to adjust I. INTRODUCTION the queries before proceeding with the next retrieval round.

The unwilling, to provide feedback by setting the relevance efficient access to the individual images in such collections weights of individual images. Consequently, unsatisfactory is yet an unsolved challenge. Traditional image retrieval was images are returned to the users. Another limitation is that text-based.

Such noise reduces the image retrieval performance, and is therefore filtered. Next, the skeleton of the object in an image can be sketched by applying edge detection and edge tracing. Edges are detected by measuring gray-level discontinuities in the image. Hence, (a) an edge is defined as a set of connected pixels with derivative values larger than a preset threshold. The presence of an edge at a point in an image can be detected by the first- order derivative. The least-mean-squared method is used to perform the gradient analysis. The gradient vector for an (c) (d) image f(x, y) at location (x, y) can be derived as follows Figure 1.
