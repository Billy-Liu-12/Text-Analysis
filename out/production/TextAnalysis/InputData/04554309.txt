Meeting Real-time Requirements for a low bitrate  Multimedia encoding framework

ABSTRACT A serious bottleneck in real-time multimedia applica- tions is the non-availability of required network band- width. While much research has been done on multime- dia compression and network resource optimization, multimedia delivery is still a big concern especially for scarce resource networks. The virtues of network aware video coding and application of domain specific com- pression techniques have not yet been fully explored. In this paper we propose a dynamic Network Bandwidth Allocation Scheme which deals with intelligent trans- mission of the video sequence over the network. We incorporate the knowledge of the network conditions to determine how various parts of the video frames are encoded. The module is called is called SDM (Smart Decision Maker) and it builds over an intelligent classi- fication of Video into Visual Objects (VOs). An estimate of the available network bandwidth is obtained which is then distributed optimally between the different frame constituents based on their relative importance and mo- tion.

1. INTRODUCTION Meeting bandwidth requirements and maintaining accept- able image quality simultaneously is a challenge for image and multimedia processing community. This paper ad- dresses the following issues to develop a network-based resource allocation framework for low motion videos:  (a) The solution must enable a streaming server to perform real-time processing (b) It should generate an optimal bit- stream that is best perceptually based on the estimates from the network (c) It must enable low-complexity decoding with low-memory requirements (d) The scalable bitstream must be resilient to packet loss events.

In this paper we discuss a new approach for network aware optimal    resource    allocation referred   as    SDM. The multimedia is first generically classified into various Visual    Figure 1.

Further,  DWT based CEZW encod- ing    [1]   and adaptive arithmetic encoding is used to ob- tain a rate scalable bit-stream.

2. CLASSIFICATION  The first step in a content based resource allocation scheme is the classification of sample video frames into various VOs. However, this depends on the type and requirements of the videos. For example Figure 1 shows the snapshots of a    classroom   video    which      are     different   from   the requirements of a remote laboratory video sequence shown in figure 2 or a video surveillance sequence shown in figure 3.

In figure 1 we are interested in the important objects of the video. For example ? a classroom video can be modeled as composition of the teacher, black board and the back- ground. The background here is static and we have prior information regarding the characteristics of the frame and VOs associated. We can specific parameters to segment out the teacher and black board regions as shown in [2]. The remote laboratory videos pose a different challenge where there is large activity within a localized region. A local time adaptive mean of Gaussian scheme is used to segment the important regions from remote laboratory sequence [3].

The time adaptive mean of Gaussian scheme is used for such videos also however, in these cases we are more vigilant about activity. In remote laboratory videos only significant regions were considered VOs while in Surveillance videos we have to consider insignificant motion regions also as possible surveillance objects.

2.1 Classroom object Segmentation A typical classroom lecture has Teacher Writing On board (TWOB) sessions (Fig. 1). These sessions have a teacher (complete view) writing on Black Board and explaining the class points to the students. Some special characteristics that help in identifying TWOB frames are as follows: The complete board is visible, motion is slow, some students may be visible in the view and a significant part of the tu- tor's body may be visible in the frame (see Fig.1). The height of teacher in these frames generally doesn?t vary much. Frame are classified into three visual objects: back- ground, Black Board and the tutor. In this paper, we have modeled the background for static camera. Modeling the background  is  an  important  task.  For  static  camera, we   Figure 3.

need to reconstruct the region corresponding to the tutor.

For the initial prediction of the background, we assume a set of frames that have significant tutor motion. Next we extract the background region by removing the teacher re- gion. We find the pixel difference matrix of the two frames and enhance it to get two largest Visual Objects. Then they are removed to obtain the background image. Then we de- tect the horizontal and vertical regions and find the black board regions. Finally, we find the teacher region by com- paring the present frame with the modeled background.

Figure 4 shows the working of our approach on an instruc- tional video.

2.2 Statistical Model based Video Segmentation By adopting the video in terms of the relevance of the ob- jects detected in each frame we avoid the improper band- width usage in preserving the quality of useless parts of the video. Therefore our first module uses a real time segmen- tation approach to detect moving objects in the scene. In surveillance video scenes, most of the picture typically be- longs to the background, where the pixel value is easily estimated with the use of a statistical background model.

Since real time processing is required for object segmenta- tion, the time adaptive mixture of Gaussians method, pro- posed by Satuffer [4] and Harville [5] is used which is a robust and also computationally inexpensive. In the general method, the temporal signal is modeled with a time- adaptive mixture of Gaussians with R components. The probability of observing the value z(t) at time t is given by:  ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )   ( ) ( | , ) R  t t t t t r r r  r P z w N z ? ?  =  =?   where ( )trw  , ( )t r?  and ( )tr? are the mixing coefficients, the  mean, and the standard deviation, respectively, of the r-th Gaussian of the mixture associated with the signal at time t.

The details of the implementation are given in [4,5]. Figure 5 shows a sample input and output of our segmentation algorithm over a video frame.

3. COMPRESSION SCHEME  DWT based compression algorithms have been developed in the recent years to address multi-resolution delivery of video streams. The Embedded Zerotree Wavelet (EZW) [11,16] algorithm generates encoded bits in a specific order of importance. Both EZW and SPIHT [17] are spatial tree based and  exploit magnitude correlation across  barids  of decomposition. We use a modified CEZW algorithm [13] to develop a real-time video compression system.

The design considerations for a scalable coder are the proper choice of a transform filter that serves as bottom support for efficient Wavelet domain coding techniques. Le Gall?s 5/3 filter was used in the implementation to achieve a simple design of this module with less floating point op- erations. This helps to achieve a real-time implementation.

The input image ( RGB color) was transformed to YUV space and 4:2:0 down-sampled by the encoder.

4. SMART DECISION MAKER  The desired objective of video coding for any multimedia application is to achieve the continuous curve that parallels the distortion-rate curve with a single bit stream. A network aware content based scheme can achieve this goal. We util- ize the virtues of Dynamic Resource Allocation that adap- tively manages the bandwidth allocation to the different VOs according to their relative importance and their per- ceptible quality. Thus the network traffic is decided based on: a) Available Network Bandwidth.

b) Relative Motion in the VB.

c) User Preference DRA closely tracks the unpredictable bandwidth variations due to heterogeneous access-technologies of the receivers (e.g., analog modem, cable mode, xDSL, etc.) or due to dynamic changes in network conditions (e.g., congestion events). The estimate of Network Bandwidth is based on round trip time (RTT) calculations from Network Band- width Estimation tools. We illustrate our generic SDM al- gorithm next.

The input frames, after classification into VOs are sepa- rately coded by a CEZW coder into different bit streams.

The compressor gives the Energy of each VO as an output along with the compressed stream. The VOs are arranged in a Group (called as GOP or Group of Pictures).

We identify each VO in the stream in current GOP. The index i  has been used for GOP number, m for frame num- ber, k for thk visual block found in the stream. Let K VBs be present in the present GOP and k=0 corresponds to background. Let G denotes the group of picture size. We have considered a static size of VB for one GOP and the information is sent at the beginning of each GOP. ki?  de- notes the relative area of  thk  VB in thi  frame.

It should be noted that   1 [1, ] K  k i  k i GOP  =  ? = ? ?? This ensures that the areas are normalized. The motion in each block is measured as ki? :  1 1  ( ) / ( )  max ( )  k k i i i  k k k i GOP i i  ar VO ar F abs? ? < +  ? =  = ? ? ?   where kiVO  denotes the area of selected VO.

k? thus de-  notes the maximum change in size of VO during one GOP.

The degree of motion of kth VO is used to allocating a high- er bandwidth to it.   We define the proportionality factor i? as follows:   ( ){ } *( )  ( * i bl  i k k k k i i  allk  B B k E P  ? ?  ?= ? ? + +?     Figure 6. Overall Working of Resource Allocation Architecture  Here, *estB  denotes the estimate of network bandwidth at time of encoding  thi  frame and blB  denotes the base layer bandwidth. kP is the user specified preference for thk VB default taken as 0. This variable is helpful to encode the prior knowledge of the system. For example- in case of instructional classroom lectures we can pre-set high priority to blackboard.

i kE  denotes the energy of the error frame (or the mean  square value of error frame) for VO and hence the degree ofmotion in the VO. Finally, the bandwidth is allocated using the following rule:  ( ){ }* ( *k k k k ki i i i iBW k E P? ?= ? ? + + where k varies over all available VOs for a GOP.

and   K  i i k  k B B  =  = ?? .

5. SYSTEM SUMMARY  The overall scheme presented in this work is presented in figure 6. The input videos were first classified in terms of their content. As explained both static and moving back- ground scenes were modeled using background modeling and L-TAMOG technique. The Network Bandwidth Allo- cation scheme explained in the previous section is used to transmit different VOs according to their significance. The degree of motion in the VO, and their relative significance determine the allotted available bandwidth.

6. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS  The experiments are presented in this section. The verifica- tion of the proposed algorithm was done primarily using MATLAB. The segmentation scheme, the compression block (CEZW coder) and simulation of SDM module was done in MATLAB and later the code was implemented on a Visual C++ platform. The network bandwidth estimates were taken using simulations on Network Simulator (NS- 2).

Figure 7,8 show the reconstructed frames for different vid- eos. In figure 7 and 8 we can observe that a slightly higher bandwidth is required. For figure 8, we can observe that the poor quality of input video leads to poor perception of the reconstructed frames. This figure illustrates how we can distribute bandwidth based on available network resources.

Figure 12 explains the distribution of various VOs in case of classroom videos.

The black board bandwidth is maintained to a certain de- sired level in case of normal variations in band width.

However, the extra bandwidth is primarily shared by background region of the frame which covers most area of the frame. In case of instructional classroom lectures we have given high higher weights to black board region to ensure better perceptual reconstruction. Is can be ob- served that the drop of bandwidth (frames 100-200) to a small value causes the transmission to almost limit itself to blackboard region  7. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK  The advantages of content based video classification are used to develop a network aware coding scheme in this paper. We present the use of dynamic Network resource allocation scheme built over a wavelet based scalable encoder for a wide variety of videos and explains the working of bandwidth distribution scheme.

Figure 12 : Bandwidth distribution amongst various VOs for instruc- tional videos  A future work in this direction can be the practical devel- opment and of such a system and incorporation of a ro- bust bandwidth estimation module to the system. The proposed system can be developed and integrated in a reconfigurable platform to utilize the virtues of recon- figurable computing to achieve a cheap yet robust and fast implementation. Dynamic hardware reconfiguration to provide a robust bandwidth efficient framework for mul- timedia compression and transmission can thus be devel- oped.
