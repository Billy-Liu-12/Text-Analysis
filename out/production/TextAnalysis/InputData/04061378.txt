An Effective Approach for Periodic Web Personalization

Abstract  Periodic web personalization aims to recommend the most relevant resources to a user during a specific time pe- riod by analyzing the periodic access patterns of the user from web usage logs. In this paper, we propose a novel web usage mining approach for supporting effective peri- odic web personalization. The proposed approach first con- structs a user behavior model, called Personal Web Usage Lattice, from web usage logs using the fuzzy Formal Con- cept Analysis technique. Based on the Personal Web Usage Lattice, resources that the user is most probably interested in during a given period can be deduced efficiently. This ap- proach enables the costly personalized resources prepara- tion process to be done in advance rather than in real-time.

The performance evaluation of the proposed periodic web personalization approach is also given in the paper.

1. Introduction  As the Web is huge and complicated, users often miss their target pages when surfing the Web. Web personaliza- tion [2] is one of the promising approaches to tackle this problem by adapting the content and structure of websites to the needs of the users by taking advantage of the knowl- edge acquired from the analysis of the users? access behav- iors. Many techniques have been investigated for discov- ering various web access patterns from web usage logs for web personalization. These include rule-based filtering ap- proaches, content-base filtering approaches [7], collabora- tive filtering approaches [4] and hybrid approaches [11].

Most web usage mining techniques focus mainly on min- ing common access patterns. However, the periodic charac- teristics of access patterns are often neglected. In practice, many useful access patterns occur frequently only in a par- ticular period, such as every morning, but not in other peri- ods due to user surfing habits. Such access patterns are re-  1The author is currently a research scientist in HP Labs China.

ferred to as periodic access patterns. With periodic access patterns of a user, we can easily deduce the resources that the user is most probably interested in during a specific time period. The personalized resources can then be prepared in advance and delivered to the user during that specific time period. We call such task as Periodic Web Personalization.

Different from most web personalization approaches, the periodic web personalization approach does not rely on the user?s current access information which could be mislead- ing as the current access might be just some intermediate web pages before reaching the target pages.

In this paper, we propose a novel web usage mining approach based on fuzzy theory [13] and Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) [3] for constructing a user behavior model, and then uses it for supporting effective periodic web per- sonalization for the user. The performance evaluation of the proposed approach is also given in the paper.

2. Periodic Web Personalization  Web usage mining [10], which mines web usage logs for user models and personalization, is also a promising technique for periodic web personalization. Research work [5, 6, 9] has been carried out for discovering periodic pat- terns from time series databases. However, most of these works mainly focus on mining periodic patterns, rather than applying such patterns for practical applications. They only discuss some potential applications of periodic patterns. For example, Ozden et al. [9] mentioned that periodic associ- ation rules can be used for trend analysis, prediction, fore- casting and decision making. Li et al. [6] stated that the calendar-based temporal association rules can be used to represent normal network activities in different time periods of a day. Moreover, Li and Deogun [5] also discussed that the periodic patterns can be used not only for data character- ization, but also for future periodicity prediction. However, to the best of our knowledge, no approaches have been pro- posed for periodic web personalization.

Figure 1 shows the architecture of the proposed periodic web personalization system. All web access requests of a  on Web Intelligence (WI 2006 Main Conference Proceedings)(WI'06) 0-7695-2747-7/06 $20.00  ? 2006    user are first recorded by the Web server and stored into its web usage logs. The User Behavior Model Construction component then constructs the Personal Web Usage Lattice model of the user. When the period conditions are specified by the user or the Web server, the Periodic Web Personal- ization component will generate the personalized resources from the Personal Web Usage Lattice. The Web server will then prepare and organize the corresponding resources and provide them to the user during the given time periods.

3. User Behavior Model Construction  The URLs recorded in web usage logs contain little se- mantic information about the web contents accessed by users. In this research, we assume that each requested URL in web usage logs has been annotated with the correspond- ing semantic information, i.e., one or more predefined top- ics or categories, such as News, Sports and Entertainment.

Such task can be done easily by the designer or adminis- trator of the website manually or semi-automatically. An example of semantically enriched web usage log is given in Table 1. As shown in Table 1, the web usage log con- tains several fields on user identification (UserID), request time (Timestamp), requested URLs (URL) and topics (Se- mantic Annotation). The semantic annotation indicates the predefined topics that are presented in the web page of the corresponding requested URL.

Table 1. An example of a semantically en- riched web usage log.

UserID Timestamp URL Semantic Annotation User1 21/05/2005 08:20:01 URL1 T1, T2, T3, ...

User1 21/05/2005 08:22:32 URL2 T7, T3, T5, ...

User2 21/05/2005 08:22:50 URL7 T1, T3, T8, ...

User1 21/05/2005 08:27:30 URL3 T3, T1, ...

If a user accessed specific resources periodically, we can consider that the user has a web access activity (or periodic access pattern), which can be interpreted as ?A certain user is interested in specific resources during a specific period?.

Therefore, we can use a set of periodic attributes Mp and resource attributes Mr to represent web access activities. In this research, we have defined eight real-life temporal con- cepts, namely Early Morning, Morning, Noon, Early After- noon, Late Afternoon, Evening, Night and Late Night, as periodic attributes. Alternatively, we can also use days of week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.) and other real-life tem- poral concepts (e.g., weekdays, weekend, or months) as pe- riodic attributes for more general purposes. All predefined topics for a certain website can be regarded as resource at- tributes for describing web access activities. The selection of the appropriate domain-specific topics depends on the ap- plications. For example, the product names in product cat- alogs can be used for e-commerce?s websites, whereas the categories of news can be used for news websites.

3.1. Preprocessing  In Preprocessing, we need to process the original web usage logs in order to identify all personal access sessions for each individual user. Similar preprocessing tasks, i.e., data cleaning, user identification and session identification, for traditional web server logs discussed in [1] can be used:  ? Data cleaning. We can clean out unnecessary entries according to the topics in the ?Semantic Annotation? field based on the selected resource attributes Mr. En- tries in web usage logs are regarded as useful when the topics of their requested URLs refer to at least one resource attribute in Mr.

? User identification. For analyzing personal access behavior, unique users must be identified using the ?UserID? field.

? Session identification. If the difference between the timestamps of two consecutive requests from the same user is greater than a given timeout threshold, it could be considered that a new access session has started. We use 30 minutes as the default timeout threshold.

An access session S = ?(URL1, t1), (URL2, t2), ? ? ? , (URLn, tn)? is a sequence of requested URLi with times- tamp ti (1 ? i ? n). The duration di of URLi can be estimated simply as di = (ti+1 ? ti). For URLn that does not have ?tn+1?, its duration can be estimated by the average duration of the current session, i.e., dn = (d1 + d2 + ? ? ? + dn?1)/(n ? 1) = (tn ? t1)/(n ? 1).

To compute dn, we need n > 1, i.e., we only retain access sessions containing more than one requested URL. Further- more, we can evaluate the start and end time of S as t1 and (tn + dn) respectively. For subsequent processing, we ig- nore the date information in the session start and end time, and convert them into a value within the interval [0, 24].

For example, the session start time ?21/05/2005 08:20:01? is converted into 8.33.

on Web Intelligence (WI 2006 Main Conference Proceedings)(WI'06) 0-7695-2747-7/06 $20.00  ? 2006    Definition 1. A period of an access session S is defined as a continuous time interval with a start time ts(S) ? [0, 24] and an end time te(S) ? [0, 24]. It is denoted as  p(S) = {  [ts(S), te(S)], if ts(S) ? te(S) [0, te(S)] ? [ts(S), 24], otherwise  Suppose that each URLi in the access session S is as- sociated with a set of resource attributes Mri ? Mr for representing the semantics of the content of URLi. As such, each access session can be treated as a sequence of sets of resource attributes Mri, and denoted as S = ?(Mr1, t1, d1), (Mr2, t2, d2), ? ? ? , (Mrn, tn, dn)?. The total duration for each mk ? Mr can be used for estimating the user?s interest level of that resource during the access ses- sion S, which can be computed as  d(S, mk) = n?  i=1  ?kidi, where ?ki = {  1, if mk ? Mri 0, otherwise  3.2. Constructing Personal Web Usage Lat- tice  In Constructing Personal Web Usage Lattice, we iden- tify a user?s web access activities and construct a Personal Web Usage Lattice from the personal access sessions of the user. In practice, different people may have different in- terpretations for real-life temporal concepts. For requested resources, the similar problem exists because it is difficult to interpret accurately the intention of a user during an ac- cess session. Fuzzy theory [13] is one of the appropriate techniques to describe such vagueness in information and incorporated into Formal Concept Analysis [3] for repre- senting both periodic attributes and resource attributes.

To do this, we first construct the Web Usage Context for a user from his/her preprocessed access sessions.

Definition 2. A fuzzy periodic Web Usage Context is K = (G, Mp, Mr, I), where G is a set of access sessions for a user, Mp is a set of periodic attributes, Mr is a set of re- source attributes and I = R(G ? (Mp ? Mr)) is a fuzzy set on the domain of G ? (MP ? Mr) to represent fuzzy relations between access sessions g ? G and attributes m ? Mp ? Mr. Each fuzzy relation R(g, m) ? I is repre- sented by a membership value ?(g, m) ? [0, 1], where  ?(g, m) = {  ?p(g, m), if m ? Mp ?r(g, m), if m ? Mr  Based on the above definition, each access session g ? G can also be denoted as a fuzzy set on the domain of Mp ? Mr, i.e., g = {m, ?(g, m) | m ? Mp ? Mr}.

The membership value ?p(g, mp) for a periodic attribute mp ? Mp in an access session g ? G can be computed  using the period of g, i.e., p(g). In this research, the member function is defined as ?p(g, mp) = maxt?p(g){?p(t, mp)}, where ?p(t, mp) is defined in Figure 2, which is modified from [8].

The membership value ?r(g, mr) for a resource attribute mr ? Mr in an access session g ? G can be computed us- ing the total duration of mr, i.e, d(g, mr). In this research, the member function is defined as  ?r(g, mr) =  { 0, if z(g, mr) < 12Z(mr) 2z(g,mr)  Z(mr) ? 1, if 1  Z(mr) ? z(g, mr) ? Z(mr)  1, if z(g, mr) > Z(mr)  where  z(g, mr) = d(g, mr)  te(g) ? ts(g) and Z(mr) = ?  gk?G d(gk, mr)? gk?G(te(gk)? ts(gk))  Z(mr) is defined as the proportion of the total duration of accessing the resource mr in all access sessions of the user, which indicates the user?s global interest of the re- source mr. z(g, mr) is defined as the proportion of the du- ration of accessing the resource mr within the access ses- sion g, which indicates the user?s local interest of the re- source mr.

A fuzzy periodic Web Usage Context can be represented by a cross table with rows indicating access sessions and columns indicating the periodic and resource attributes. A membership value ?(g, m) ? [0, 1] in row g and column m indicates the fuzzy relation between the access session g and attribute m.

Based on the fuzzy periodic Web Usage Context, the Per- sonal Web Usage Lattice can be constructed.

Definition 3. Given a Web Usage Context K = (G, Mp, Mr, I), we define the set of attributes common to access sessions in A ? G as A? = {m ? Mp ? Mr | ?g ? A : ?(g, m) > 0}, and the set of access sessions which have all the same attributes in B ? Mp ? Mr as B? = {g ? G | ?m ? B : ?(g, m) > 0}.

Definition 4. Given a Web Usage Context K = (G, Mp, Mr, I), the fuzzy support of a set of attributes B ? Mp ? Mr and B ?= ? is defined as  Sup(B) =  ? g?B?(?p(g) ? ?r(g))  |G|  on Web Intelligence (WI 2006 Main Conference Proceedings)(WI'06) 0-7695-2747-7/06 $20.00  ? 2006    where  ?p(g) =  { minmp?(B?Mp){?p(g,mp)}, if B ? Mp ?= ? 1, otherwise  and  ?r(g) =  { minmr?(B?Mr){?r(g, mr)}, if B ? Mr ?= ? 1, otherwise  Definition 5. Given a Web Usage Context K = (G, Mp, Mr, I), if there exists a pair (A, B) with A ? G, B ? Mp ? Mr (B ? Mp ?= ? and B ? Mr ?= ?), A? = B and B? = A, then v(B) = {m, ?(B, m) | m ? B}, a fuzzy set on B, is called a web access activity, where ?(B, m) = maxg?B?{?(g, m)}. We also define v(B) = vp(B) ? vr(B), where vp(B) = {mp, ?(B, mp) | mp ? B ? Mp} and vr(B) = {mr, ?(B, mr) | mr ? B ? Mr} represent two fuzzy subsets of v(B) on domains of B ?Mp and B?Mr respectively. In addition, v(?) = ? is defined as a virtual web access activity. WP = {v(Bi)} denotes the set of all web access activities of a user. |WP | is the total number of web access activities.

A web access activity represents a periodic web access behavior of a user, i.e., it is an implication relation from periodic attributes to resource attributes.

Definition 6. The fuzzy support of a web access activity v(B) is defined as Sup(v(B)) = Sup(B) and the fuzzy confidence of v(B) is defined as Conf(v(B)) = prob((B? Mr) | (B?Mp)) = Sup(B)Sup(B?Mp) , where prob(? | ?) is a con- ditional probability. For virtual web access activity v(?), we define Sup(v(?)) = 1.0 and Conf(v(?)) = 1.0.

Definition 7. For two web access activities of a user v(Bi), v(Bj) ? WP , v(Bi) is a sub-activity of v(Bj), denoted as v(Bi) <WP v(Bj), if and only if Bj ? Bi. Equiva- lently, v(Bj) is a super-activity of v(Bi). <WP is a partial order on WP , called activity relationship. In particular, if v(Bi) <WP v(Bj) and there is no v(Bk) ? WP (Bk ?= Bi and Bk ?= Bj) such that v(Bi) <WP v(Bk) <WP v(Bj), then v(Bi) is a direct sub-activity of v(Bj), and v(Bj) is a direct super-activity of v(Bi), denoted as v(Bi) ?WP v(Bj). ?WP is called a direct activity relationship.

Obviously, the virtual web access activity v(?) is the super-activity of all other web access activities.

Definition 8. A Personal Web Usage Lattice based on a Web Usage Context K = (G, Mp, Mr, I) of a user is LP = (WP , <WP ), where WP is the set of all web access activities, and <WP is a partial order on WP to represent the hierarchy of web access activities.

Some efficient approaches have been proposed in tradi- tional FCA for computing concept lattice. Among them, the  TITANIC algorithm [12] is one of the most efficient lattice construction algorithms. In this research, we have modi- fied the TITANIC algorithm with fuzzy support and fuzzy confidence for constructing the Personal Web Usage Lattice from the Web Usage Context.

4. Personalized Resources Generation  The Personalized Resources Generation component searches the Personal Web Usage Lattice of a user for gen- erating a set of ordered personalized resources according to a given period condition.

Definition 9. A period condition pc is defined as a contin- uous time interval with a start time ts ? [0, 24] and an end time te ? [0, 24], which is denoted as  pc = {  [ts, te], if ts ? te [0, te] ? [ts, 24], otherwise  In addition, the fuzzy period condition of a period condi- tion pc is defined as a fuzzy set Pf (pc) = {mp, ?p(pc, mp) | mp ? Mp and ?p(pc, mp) = maxt?pc{?p(t,mp)}}, where ?p(t, mp) was defined in Figure 2.

In order to generate personalized resources, we first need to search the Personal Web Usage Lattice LP for all period- supported activities of pc, which are web access activities with similar periodic attributes to the fuzzy period condition Pf (pc).

Definition 10. The period similarity between a web access activity v(B) ? WP and a given period condition pc is de- fined as  Simp(v(B), pc) = |vp(B) ? Pf (pc)| |vp(B) ? Pf (pc)|  Definition 11. The period-supported activities of a given period condition pc based on a Personal Web Usage Lat- tice LP = (WP , <WP ) are defined as a set of web access activities SAp(pc, LP ) = {v(Bi) | v(Bi) ? WP , vp(Bi) ? Pf (pc) or vp(Bi) ? Pf (pc)}. For two period-supported ac- tivities v(Bi), v(Bj) ? SAp(pc, LP ), we call that v(Bi) has a higher priority than that of v(Bj), denoted as v(Bj) <pri v(Bi), if ? Simp(v(Bi), pc) > Simp(v(Bj), pc), or ? Simp(v(Bi), pc) = Simp(v(Bj), pc), but  Conf(v(Bi)) > Conf(v(Bj)), or ? Conf(v(Bi)) = Conf(v(Bj)), but Sup(v(Bi)) >  Sup(v(Bj)).

From the discovered period-supported activities, we can extract personalized resources.

on Web Intelligence (WI 2006 Main Conference Proceedings)(WI'06) 0-7695-2747-7/06 $20.00  ? 2006    Definition 12. The personalized resources of a given pe- riod condition pc based on a Personal Web Usage Lat- tice LP = (WP , <WP ) is defined as a set of re- source attributes occurring in at least one activity in SAp(pc, LP ), i.e., PR(pc, LP ) = {mr | ?v(Bi) ? SAp(pc, LP ), such that mr ? Bi ? Mr}.

In order to distinguish the importance of personalized re- sources to the user, we need to rank the resources according to the order of their priorities.

Definition 13. The period-supported activity of each mr ? PR(pc, LP ), which is v(Bi) ? SAp(pc, LP ) with mr ? Bi ? Mr, is given the highest priority. For two personal- ized resources mri and mrj , we call that mri has a higher priority than that of mrj , denoted as mrj <pri mri, if ? the period-supported activity of mri has a higher pri-  ority than that of mrj , or ? mri and mrj have the same period-supported activity  v(B), but mri has a higher membership value than that of mrj in v(B), i.e., ?(B, mri) > ?(B, mrj).

The algorithm PR Gen for generating a set of ordered personalized resources for a given period condition pc based on a Personal Web Usage Lattice of a user LP is given in Algorithm 4.1. In Line 5, the algorithm PSA Search, which is given in Algorithm 4.2, is called for searching all period-supported activities for pc based on LP . In Line 6, all period-supported activities are sorted in descending or- der of priority. In Line 7, since all personalized resources belong to the same period-supported activity, they are only sorted in descending order of fuzzy membership value.

Algorithm 4.1 PR Gen(pc, LP ) Input:  pc - a period condition LP = (WP , <WP ) - a Personal Web Usage Lattice  Output: PRo(pc, LP ) - a set of ordered personalized resources  Process: 1: Initialize PRo(pc, LP )? {?} 2: for all v(B) ?WP do 3: v(B).mark ? unvisited 4: end for 5: Get period-supported activities SAp(pc, LP ) ?

To enhance the efficiency of the period-supported activity searching process, the algorithm starts searching from the top node of the lattice and performs recursive searching for only the direct sub-activities satisfying with the period condition pc.

Performance Evaluation  In this section, we evaluate the performance of the pro- posed periodic web personalization approach.

5.1. Evaluation Measures  In order to objectively evaluate the feasibility of our pro- posed approach, we define the following two evaluation measures: applicability and satisfaction.

Definition 14. Suppose we generate personalized resources ?PRo(pc, LP )? for a given period condition pc based on a Personal Web Usage Lattice LP of a user. If PRo(pc, LP ) ?= ?, we call it applicable. Let S = {m, ?(S, m) | m ? Mp ? Mr} be an access session in the period p(S) of that user. If pc ? p(S) ?= ?, we call S a period-supported session of the generated personalized re- sources. If ?mr ? PRo(pc, LP ) with ?r(S, mr) > 0, we call S a resource-supported session of the generated per- sonalized resources.

Definition 15. Let PRall = {PR1, PR2, ? ? ? , PRn} be a collection of sets of personalized resources for overall web personalization, and PRa be the subset of PRall compris- ing all applicable sets of personalized resources. The appli- cability of overall web personalization is defined as  applicability = |PRa| |PRall|  on Web Intelligence (WI 2006 Main Conference Proceedings)(WI'06) 0-7695-2747-7/06 $20.00  ? 2006    As the Personal Web Usage Lattice only stores typical web access activities (supported by some of access sessions in the training web usage logs), if the period-supported ac- tivities cannot be found, the generated set of personalized resources will be empty. Therefore, the applicability mea- sure gives a rough idea on how often applicable personal- ized resources will be generated.

Definition 16. Let ST be the set of all access sessions for testing. SSp(PRi) is the subset of ST comprising all period-supported sessions of the personalized resources PRi, and SSr(PRi) is the subset of SSp(PRi) comprising all resource-supported sessions in SSp(PPRi). The satis- faction of the personalized resources PRi is defined as  satisfaction(PRi) =  { 0, if SSp(PRi) = ? |SSr(PRi)| |SSp(PRi)| , otherwise  The satisfaction for overall web personalization is defined as  satisfaction =  ? PRi?PRa satisfaction(PRi)  |PRa|  The satisfaction measures how likely a user is interested in one of the personalized resources in the period-supported sessions.

5.2. Experimental Results  The proposed periodic web personalization approach is implemented in C++. The experiment is performed on a 3.4GHz Intel Pentium 4 PC machine with 1GB memory, running on MS Windows XP. The web usage logs are col- lected from a web forum, called ?North Latitude One BBS? (http://bbs.nlone.net). This web forum consists of a total of 64 topics including 7 main topics (such as Past time, Sports, Computer, etc.) and 57 sub-topics (such as Movi- eTV in Past time, Soccer in Sports, etc.). The whole dataset contains a total of 6,828 access sessions from 01-May-2005 to 31-May-2005, with each session comprising requested URLs from the 64 topics. The top 4 users with most access sessions are selected as test users. We use access sessions of the 4 users from 01-May-2005 to 20-May-2005 as the train- ing dataset to construct the Personal Web Usage Lattices for the 4 test users, and use access sessions of the 4 users from 21-May-2005 to 31-May-2005 as the testing dataset to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach.

As a result, the number of generated web access activ- ities of users u13, u36, u48 and u82 are 912, 1196, 258 and 1005 respectively. We then generate personalized re- sources for a set of predefined period conditions and mea- sure the performance based on the applicability and sat- isfaction measures with respect to the different durations  of period conditions (from 0.5 to 4 hours) and the differ- ent numbers of personalized resources (from 1 to 6). Sup- pose that [ts, te] = [0, 24] is the whole period for pe- riodic web personalization and d ? (0, 24] is the dura- tion of each period condition. Then, we have a total of n = [ te?ts?d  d + 1] period conditions, where each period condition pi = [(ts+(i?1)?d), (ts+i?d)] for 1 ? i ? n.

In this experiment, we set d to four different values, i.e., d = 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0.

Figure 3 shows the applicability of the overall web per- sonalization based on the different durations of period con- ditions (from 0.5 to 4.0 hours). The experimental results have shown that the proposed periodic web personaliza- tion approach has obtained an acceptable applicability for the predefined period conditions with appropriate durations.

We have achieved at least 85.4% for the user u48 with d = 0.5 and an average of 92.3% for all the four test users with period conditions longer than and equal to 0.5 hours.

Figure 4 shows the satisfaction of the overall web per- sonalization for the different durations of period conditions (from 0.5 to 4.0 hours) based on different numbers of per- sonalized resources (from 1 to 6). As shown in Figure 4, when the number of personalized resources increases, the satisfaction also increases. But, the increase is not signifi- cant after the number of personalized resources is more than 4. Although the satisfaction can be further improved with more personalized resources (e.g., 6), too many personal- ized resources will affect the preparation process of useful resources for users. With at most 4 personalized resources, we have obtained the lowest satisfaction of 77.9% for the user u82 with d = 1.0 and the average satisfaction of 88.9% for all four test users.

alization using periodic access patterns of individual users.

Different from non-periodic approaches, the proposed ap- proach can efficiently determine which resources a user is most probably interested in during a given period without the use of the user?s current access information. This makes it possible to perform more costly personalized resource preparation in advance rather than in real-time. The ex- perimental results have shown that the proposed approach has achieved very effective web personalization evaluated by the applicability and satisfaction measures for the prede- fined period conditions.
