The Application of Grey Correlation Analysis in the Big Electrical Customers   from Baoding City

Abstract  By analyzing the data of 20 big electrical customers from Baoding city, Hebei province, calculating the consumer values, and adopting the grey correlative analysis method, this paper has found out the VIP customers from many electrical customers based on incomplete information, and defined a clear correlative degree between the important customer and the enterprise. After that, this paper puts forward a point of view based on sorting correlative degree, which asks us to devote plentiful time and energy to the loyal customers, and give them man-to-man service. The customers with low correlative degree are called low-value customers, their current and potential values are low, and enterprises should analyze the reason and give them certain training and education. Enterprise should also abandon those customers who are sensitive to price, less loyal, hard to persuade and have poor credit records.

1. The calculation of Customer's value  Customers are a kind of valuable resource for enterprises, but not every customer has contribution to enterprise?s profit.

It?s the aim of every enterprise to have high-value customers and maximize customer values. Many enterprises? attention has moved from possession of market to the value of customer.

Many scholars have done some research from different perspectives on how to define customer value and how to do quantitative analysis of customer?s value. How much will lose if the enterprise loses one customer? What will happen in the increasing of profit if we can reduce 5% losing of the customer?

Every company will have a good financial balance between investing on new business and investing on the existing customers if it knows the profit losing accompanying with dropping a customer. Unfortunately, the fiscal system could not calculate the value of one loyal customer, and the financial system often ignores the cash flow when the customer keeps relationship with the company. The existing customers will contribute to the profit of the company year by year if they can always receive good services.

Now we will talk about the detailed calculation of the customer?s value.

At first, supposing the customer will keep relationship with the company for 5 years: N=5. The initial cost of one customer  (marketing cost) is 500 Yuan: C0=?500. The price when the customer first buy the product is 10000 Yuan: P0=?10000.

The increasing income that the companies want to get from each customer is 5000 Yuan: R=?5000. The lending rate is 6%: r =6%. Then, the value of one customer is equal to the product, at the first time plus the expenditure in next years, at last subtract the marketing cost from the sum.

Customer?s value =P0?C0+ R? ? ? r  r N?? 1/11    =10000-500+5000? ? ?  %6 %61/11 5?? ?30563  If we can use the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) to make the customers buy more electrical products after they have become customers of the electrical company, the value of customer will increased also. For example, if the customer has purchased a service valued 3000 Yuan after his first purchasing of a commodity valued 10000 Yuan, the company may hope the customer purchase it every year. So, the value of customer is increased as follows:  3000+3000? ? ?  %6 %61/11 6??  ??15637 Therefore, the value of customer is 46200 Yuan, the sum of  30563 Yuan and 15637 Yuan.

Then, let us talk about the losing of profit after dropping  one customer.

In the calculation before we can see the value of this  customer, the profit is 46200 Yuan. If the customer does not have any dealing with the company, firstly the company will lose the 46200 Yuan; secondly the credit standing of the company will be damaged. If the damaged quotiety is 10%, the economic losing will be 46200 ? 10%=4620. So, if the company loses one customer, the direct profit losing is 50820 Yuan.

Actually, the losing of the company is not only that. Every customer who left the company has his own reason. Maybe the product or the service of this company has some problems.

Maybe the company could not give a satisfying response to the customer?s complaint. If a company reduces its customer losing rate by 5% every year, its profit could increase by 25% to 85%. The cost of obtaining a new customer is as 5 times as that of retaining an existing customer, and an unsatisfied customer can affect 5 more others on average. So we can see that losing one customer actually means losing a series of customers.

DOI    DOI    DOI 10.1109/ICNC.2008.827     Supposing that only 10% of the customer will lodge a complaint against the company, it means when the company has received 100 lodgings, there are 1000 customers who are not satisfied. All of these customers will take damage to the market of the company, and the losing is every customer?s value multiple the number of the customer. In this example, the final losing will be more than 5000000 Yuan.

2. The approach of grey correlation analysis  The loyal customer can give the company rich profit, so obtaining the loyal customer is every company?s aim. Some companies take much time and money to find out the loyal customer, but the result is failing. They have got more and more customers, but the customers do not give profit to the company. The reason of this situation is they can not use the right method to find out the most valuable customers. The theory of grey system is firstly advocated by a Chinese professor named Deng Julong in 1982. In this theory, all of the systems are divided into three kinds: the white system, the black system and the grey system. The white means all of the system is known, the black means all of the system is unknown, and the grey means some part of the system is known and some part is unknown. So the grey system is a kind of system which includes known information and unknown information. The objective of analyzing the grey system is making the system be known, namely using the known information to open out the unknown information. Every company which wants to implement management of loyal customer should establish a scientific and reasonable recognize model to find out the loyal customer, to support pertinent service and improve the quality of product and service.

Amusing there has one referenced numerical sequence {X0} (the industrial power quantity of Baoding city) and one comparative numerical sequence {Xi} i=1 2 n (the big customers of industrial power from Baoding city). The essential idea of the correlation analysis is to find out the VIP customers by analyzing how the changing of the comparative sequence took effect on the referenced sequence. The basic approaches are as follows.

2.1. Make the original data standardized  Because the dimension and the unitage of original data are different with each other, they should be standardized before conducting the correlation analysis. The common approaches are initial value method and average value method. In this paper we adopt the first one, namely use the first number Xi (l) to divide other numbers. After the standardization, we will get a balanced and comparable ratio.

2.2. Use subtraction sequence to have the absolute difference between Xi and X0 in its referenced sequence at every time  2.3. Calculate the two level minimal and maximal difference.

Two level minimal difference is ?i(k)=|X0(k)-Xi(k)|.

i(k)=|X0(k)-Xi(k)|, the minimum is selected at every  moment,  min|X0(k)-Xi(k)|, and then the minimum is selected from the minimums. That is the minimum difference between  the poles.

? ? ? ? ? ? akkininmmkininmm xx i  ki i  ki ???? 0 ;the  maximum difference between poles: i(k)=|X0(k)-Xi(k),and then the maximum is selected at every moment. max|X0(k)- Xi(k)|, the maximum is selected from the maximums. That is the maximum difference between poles.

According to the ri to fix on the correlative degree between every factor and the system, high degree means the high correlation with the system.

3. Application examples  3.1. Data source  In Dec. 2007, the writer conducted a statistical survey on the consumption amount of electric power from Mar. to Nov.

in 2007 from Baoding city?s 20 big industrial electricity customers. For the lack of data, the data should not be coped with multi recursion stepwise recursion and other methods.

We could get the VIP customer by conducting grey correlative analysis.

Calculate the correlative degree r1=1/9*(1+0.9496+0.8746+ ? +1.2461)=0.9445 ?  r2=0.6983 ,r3=0.8331 ,  r4=0.8138 ,  r5=0.8592, r6=0.8997, r7=0.6861, r8=0.8754, r9=0.7762, r10=0.8951, r11=0.7075, r12=0.9226, r13=0.7850, r14=0.8821, r15=0.5978, r16=0.8480, r17=0.8431, r18=0.8337, r19=0.7481,  So, the correlative degree sequence are as follows: Huaxian 0.9445 > Fengfan 0.9226 > Huabei Aluminum  0.8997 > Sanlian Paper 0.8951 > uaqiang Spin 0.8821 > Yimian 0.8754 > Quyang Fertilizer 0.8592 > Baoshuo Green 0.8480 > Tianwei 0.8431 > Aoyu Steel 0.8337 > Jingzheng Steel 0.8331 > Baoshuo 0.8138 > Film 0.7850 > Huabei petroleum 0.7762 > Taihang Cement0.7481 > Shuohuang Steel 0.7075 > Yaxin Steel 0.6983 > Bank Paper 0.6861 > Yixian Fertilizer 0.5978  4. Conclusion  The grey correlative analysis could tell us the correlation among all factors of the grey system when the system changes.

Through processing the past data, we can make clear the correlation between the factors and the system; get factors which affect the system mostly. Getting the approach degree of these factors, finding primary factor, we will nail down the emphases of the work. The correlation indicates the correlative degree between relatively sequence and referenced sequence.

The degree is more correlative when it?s more nearer to 1.

Looking for VIP customer by the grey-correlative analysis, we  can serve the customer effectively with less blindness and more scientism. The order of correlative degree indicates that the correlations of Huaxian, Fengfan, Huabei Aluminum and Sanlian Paper are the highest and these customers are the most useful to the profit, Huaqiang Spin, Yimian, Quyang Fertilizer, etc are less useful. Bank Paper and Yixian Fertilizer work indistinctively. So, we should invest more time and energy on Huaxian, Fengfan, Huabei Aluminum and Sanlian Paper, but instruct the customers who are at the bottom of the sequence with less time and energy.
