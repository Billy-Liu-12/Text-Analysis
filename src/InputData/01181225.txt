Abstract: This paper probes intensively into the storage methods of association rules. It proposes a new data  mining architecture with storing association rules and  describes the storage structure of association rules with  relational algebra. This storage method stores the  association rules in the relational database.

Keywords: Association Rule, Relational Algebra, Data Mining  1 introduction The new framework of DSS is formed by data warehouse,  OLAP and data mining, which put DSS into practical use.

Data mining IS developed with the technology of artificial  intelligence (AI) and database. It analyzes the data  automatically and mines the potential information to help users for decision-making.[?IP1. The purpose of data mining  is to find out the patterns implied in the data set. There are  some differences between data and patterns. Data is  enormous and irregular. There is no practical meaning  existing in the unprocessed data. However, patterns are the  schemas implied in enormous dataL3]. At present, the  research of data mining has integrated with data  warehouse. Data warehouse can re-extract the a great  amount of historical data from the traditional database to  form a certain data set, which is concentrate, subject  -oriented, changing with the time and obtaining relatively  stable contents. Data warehouse provides strongly data  support for the construction of DSS. Many mature products of data warehouse have been used extensively. Data warehouse also provides a new application area and strong  supports for data mining technology. Data warehouse  processes a, series of work, such as collection, aggregation,  storage, management of data. It provides the regular and  enormous data to the process of data mining and makes  data mining more engaged in knowledge discovery.

Data mining, a core technology of realizing business intelligence, has received considerable research attention  in recent years. How to improve efficiency of data mining  become popular research issues. The problem is solved in  the following aspects.

e e  To find out more efficient data mining algorithm.

To improve the hardware performance and parallel  ability.

To store and use the results of data mining. a The third approach can solve the problem of volume  expansion of data warehouse, enhance algorithm efficiency  and use the mining result effectively. This paper studies the  storage methods? of association rules and data mining  structure.

2 Data Mining System with Storage ?of the Association Rules The typical data mining system is based on data  warehouse or large relational database and has integrated  with the function of inquiry, analysis, expression and etc.

The system is composed of various technologies and can  provide DSS information for users. There are three layers  in the data mining system: data layer, core mining model  and result-expressing tool. Data layer that offers data to  mining is the foundation of the whole system. It will be  useless without data. A good data-mining tool has the  ability of storing and accessing various data.

Data mining system, which is built on data warehouse,  satisfy the demand of users to some degree. However, there are still some problems in t he  mining process:  The volume expansion of data warehouse.

e Low efficiency of data mining.

Ineffective usage of historical pattern.

Low interacted operation among the different mining  systems.

People have made many efforts and offered several  directions for solving the problems above. The key to  improve the efficiency of mining is to find out the fast algorithm. But the improvement is limited with the sharp increase of data. Another direction is to reduce the volume     of data to be processed. It suggests making full use of  mining results and only mining the newly incre  The paper introduces the idea of storing mining result and  to manage the mining-result pattern. An improved  architecture of data mining system with the storage of  association rules is proposed. This storage method will not  be limited in the storage of association rules. It will be  referenced by the other applications.

With this component  association rules can be stored and manipulated. As figure  1, the added parts are rule management subsystem and  rule base, which make  association rules. First, it uses  build rule base, regarding  management system is app  maintenance. The hollow arrowheads illustrate the process  of collecting the data from data source and obtaining the  rule after mining, storing the rules and expressing them.

The solid arrowheads illustrate the process of resp  data mining request. The procedure is that rule  management system will inquire whether there are  corresponding rules. If there are not, then the system starts  the mining procedure otherwise nothing will be done. The  dotted arrowhead illustrates the direction of original  association rules.

The improved structure solves the existing problem in the  traditional data mining system effectively. It has the  following characteristics.

a Small volume. The volume of rule base will be decreased several times compared with the data  ociation rules mined to  a  a  a  warehouse because data are more polished. If the  processing data will not be used frequently, they can  be stored in the cheap storage appliance such as tape  recorder.

Higher speed. The rule base stores association rules  or mining results. If the rules are close to the time of  mining request, they can be put into use directly  without executing the time consuming mining  procedure. Because the volume of rule base is much  smaller than data warehouse, the corresponding  speed of inquiry will be quicker.

Better interacted operation. Regular and concentrated  rule storage solves the consistence problem  effectively. With the rule base management system,  the query language similar to SQL, or the rule base  interface can be designed. Different mining tools  using the query language or calling function provided  by rule base interface can share the association rules.

Effective use of historical data. We can predict the  tendency from analyzing the change of the  association rules to provide more means for DSS.

3 Association Rules Let /={if. i2. - 0 . .  i,,,} be a set of literals, called items. Let D be a set of transactions, where each transaction T is a set of items such that T c 1. Associated with each transaction is  a unique identifier, called TID. We say that a transaction T contains X, a set of some items in I ,  if x E T . An association rule is an implication of the form xa Y , where X c 1 ,  Y c I and X n 1' = 0. The support and confidence of an association rule (X a y )  are calculated by the following two equations.

Support = The Number of Transaction That Contains X and Y  The Totul Number Of Transactions  The Number Of Transactio 11 That Contans Y Tfie Number Of Transuctto n That Contains X  Confidence =  The rule X - Y  holds in the transaction set D if its support and confidence are equal to or greater than the  user specified values. The goal of association rules is to  find the relationship between any combinations of items,  The X i s  called body of the rule, and the Y is called head  4 Existing Storage Methods of Association Rules It is difficult to share the mining results among different  mining systems because of the lack of unified method to     store them. There are two storage methods.

Method 1: Popular data mining tools, such as the DBMiner,  Intelligent Miner etc., generally stores the mining results  into files. In Intelligent Miner 6.1, the mining results are  stored into a file named re~Xn.dat[~] and can be read from  the file provided by API. There are three steps to read the  association rules in the result files in other mining tools.

First, it defines a structure. Second, it calls the function  IDMAsrParserlnitialize to initialize. Finally, it calls the  function IDMAssocRules to read the association rules. The  procedure of obtaining association rules in such way is  complicated. Different data mining tools have different  results format. It is difficult to share the mining re:ults  among different mining tools.

Method 2: Relational database15] to store mining results.

The structure of table is (Item,,.. .,ltemk NuIIM, RuleM,  confidence, suppoh). Fields Itemk are items in the  transaction data set; k specifies the total amount of items.

NullM specifies the null-mark of the rule, if there are n items  in one rule, the value of NullM should be n+l .  RuleM  specifies the rule-mark of the rule, if there are m items in  the rule head; the value of RuleM should be m+l .  The  Pumper Lock 60% 3%  Pumper Helmet 60% 3%  The common disadvantage of these two storage methods  is the lack of relative time stamp of association rule, which  stands for the change of historic data. Following is an  improved storage method to overcome these problems.

5 Relational Algebra Description of Association Rule This paper presents an approach using relational table to  store association rules. The relation schema is:  Rule- schema = (RID, BODY, HEAD, Conf, Supp) . RID represents the number of the rules, and each rule has a  unique number. The value of column BODY and HEAD,  which is the item of transaction database, constitutes an  association rule. The value of column Conf and Supp  denotes the minimal confidence threshold and minimal  support threshold. An association rule Bike A Pumper 3 Lock A Hebne t ,~  = 0 . 6 , , ~  = 0.03 is  expressed as:  Table 2. Improved association rule table  I 2 1 Bike I Lock 60% I 3% 1  Bike Pumpe Lock Helmet Null Null Null  1 2 I Bike I Helmet I 60% 1 3% 1 '  Null 4 2 60%3%     There are following problems in the relation  ASSOCI-RULE.

1) Data redundancy. A (N+M) association rule needs  N*M records. And the same (CONF, SUP) value will  be stored N*M times repeatedly.

Complex manipulation. When inserting, removing and  updating on one (N+M) association rule, it needs N*M  operations in relation table.

We can see this relation exists multivalued dependency  {BODY)->->{RID, CONF, SUP}and needs decomposition.

We use the projecting operation to project the relation over  some attributes and decompose it into two relation  schemas. The schema RULE describes the rule part of an  association rule, and the schema PARA describes the  parameter.

2)  RULE( ID, BODY, HEAD)=TIlo BODY,HEAD(ASSOCI_RULE)  PARA(ID, CONF, SUP, T I M E ) = ~ ~ D ,  CONF, sup, TIME(ASSOCI-RULE)  Duplicate tuples are likely to appear in the result of project  operation. The project operation implicitly removes any  duplicate tuples, so the result of projecting operation is a  set of tuples and hence a valid relation. In the PARA table  every association rule corresponds to a record. The column  ID becomes the primary key that has a unique identifier.

The inserting, updating and- deleting operation of an  association rule's parameter could be finished in one step.

But the redundancy still exists. (N*M) records are needed  to represent one (N+M) association rule. The relation  RULE needs to be decomposed further.

BODY( ID, BO DY)=TIio BODY( RULE)  HEAD( ID, HEAD)=rIio HEAD( RULE)  After decomposition, relation ASSOCI-RULE is  decomposed into relation BODY, HEAD, PARA. The data  redundancy of RULE has been eliminated. In each (N+M)  association rule, the body items appear N times and the  head items M times.

The storage method can be formally described as follows:  ASSOCI-RULE:  BODY (ID, BODY) ,  HEAD (ID, HEAD)  PARA (ID, CONF, SUP, TIME)  The joining operation using identical ID among three tables  composes a corresponding association rule. The  characteristics of this storage method are: The format of  association is uniform and the rule can be shared with  1 .

different mining systems. Data redundancy is low, thus  query speed is high. It's easy to extract association rules in  this storage method by joining the body, head and  parameter according to the rule's ID.

Base on the relation schema, storage of association rule in  relational database can be easily realized. The basic  operations are relational algebra operation, which provides  the foundation to implement.

6 Conclusions and Future Work The paper proposes an improved- architecture of data  mining system with the storage of association rules after  analyzing the efficiency of the present system. And it also  proposes to use the relational database to store the  association rules and describes the storage structure of  association rules with relational algebra.

The mining results, association rules, are stored in the rule  base through which users can carry various operations and  management. A consistent view of association rules is  formed so as to improve the efficiency of sharing  association rules.

Based on this improved architecture of data mining system,  there are some future study directions.

The storage method of association rule can be  referred by other storage method of mining results  such as classification rule, cluster rule etc.

A set of operations, which manipulate rules in rule  base, can be defined similar to SQL in relational  database. Using these operations, people can  execute management functions on rule base, like  adding, removing, querying and organizing data, as  well as authority management.
