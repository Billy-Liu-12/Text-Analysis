Research On Intelligent Recommended Algorithms  of Personalized Digital Library

Abstract In this paper, the intelligent recommended algorithms of association rule and collaborative filtering (CF) technology are designed to solve the problem of low utilization and waste time in the usage of digital library. Neighbor user sets are generated by CF and user-user association firstly, and then recommended lists are generated by URL association rule based on the history of neighbor user set. The neighbor user sets generated by combination of association rule and CF can fit requirements of recommended system, and the system can avoid generate meaningless rule according to mining the history of neighbor user sets. Experiments show that the utilization rate of digital book can be raised and time of search digital book can be reduced by using this recommended system.

I. INTRODUCTION With the popularity of computer and network technology,  traditional books are gradually being replaced by digital books. Digital Library welcomed by more and more users.

However, low utilization, retrieve time-consuming problem still exists. In order to make "user-centric" service concept be implemented to improve the utilization of digital books, the library began to focus more and more digital books personalized recommendation service. This is the future trend of library development.

Collaborative filtering [1] is the first technology used in personalized recommendation systems. The algorithm constructs a user-item rating matrix by using users? ratings at first, and then finds k neighbor users that have the same or similar interests and preferences with the target user, so that some items (various kinds of products) which may be interesting to the target user will be recommended to the target user by her/his neighborhood?s ratings [2].

We proposed the following algorithm in order to collaborative filtering algorithms to be applied to the digital book personalized recommendation system better.Firstly, neighbor user sets were generated by CF technology and user-user association technology, and then recommended lists were generated by URL association rule based on the history of neighbor user set. The user sets generated by combination of association rule and CF are fit requirements  of recommended system; the system can avoid generate meaningless rule according to mining the history of neighbor user sets.



II. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE The system architecture of digital book based on  collaborative filtering and association rules algorithm is designed as Fig 1. Firstly, the clicking history of users is mined by CF and association rule algorithm to generate neighbor user set. Secondly, URL association algorithms are applied in clicking history of neighbor user, and then a list of recommendations are gotten.

III. COLLABORATIVE FILTERING  A. Cold-start and Collaborative filtering is a method of making automatic  predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preferences or taste information from many users (collaborating). The underlying assumption of the CF approach is that those who agreed in the past tend to agree again in the future. The well-known recommendation systems based on CF algorithm are: Typestry[3], GroupLens [4], Ringo[5] and Video[6].

If a user does not have any rating on items, there is no way to generate recommended information, which is the cold start [7] problem. If a system has many items, and users only very few of them to rate the items, causing the user - item rating matrix is sparse, the system is difficult to find similar users, this is the sparsity [8] [9] problem.

Because of the particularity of digital books, system can only obtain whether a user browsing a digital book or not. In addition, users only browse small part of the whole digital books because of the large number of them. A large vector dimension may leads to time-consuming.

B. Improvement of similarity of The data in database of digital library is the user?s click  of each digital book, data table is user-URL sets. The similarity formula of original CF algorithm is cosine of angle between two vectors. These data must be preprocessed in order to generate the matrix, and then calculate similarity off-line. Considering the need for real-time processing of data, these data must be processed on-line. Only the URL click by users be preprocessed. We using the following formula calculate the similarity.

countitem jicommonitemjisim  _ ),(_),( ?  Where  denotes the number of digital  books browsed by both user i  and user  ),(_ jicommonitem  j . countitem _ denotes the non-repetition number of digital books browsed by all users.

One advantage of the similarity between two users calculated by formula (1) is it can be processed online by using SQL statements; the other advantage is lower computation.



IV. ASSOCIATION RULE Association rule mining is a hot area in data mining  recent years. Interesting associations or related links were found by associations rule mining from a large number of items sets. With the large amount of data continuously collected and stored, more and more people were interested in the association rules results.

A possible rule is: minimum support in the case of 0.25, 80% of readers while browsing the book A also browsing B.

When a user browses book A, you can recommend books to him book B base on the rule.

A. Limitations of association rule When association rule applied in digital books  recommended system, it?s May not meet the requirements.

The rules are generated by browsing recorders of all users, but interests of these users may not be the same, or different.

So, The rule becomes no sense at this time.

B. Improvement of association rule ? Find neighbor user by CF algorithm.

Get neighbor user set of specific user by formula (1).

? Find neighbor user by user association Convert User-URL table into URL-User, then get  User-User association by using association rule mining algorithm.

? New neighbor user set algorithm..

We can get neighbor user set of specific user by CF and  user association. Suppose neighbor user set CF represents by ),( simU , where U denotes users, sim  denotes similarity.

Suppose neighbor user set AR represents by ),( simU , where U denotes users, sim  denotes product of support and confidence, because these two parameters determine the quality of the rules.  The final neighbor user set can be generated by formula (2), given by:  ARCFiu iusimkk  isimiukkiuscore  ?? ??  ?  )(, ))((**)1(  )(*))((*))((    Where  denotes adjustment parameter, it can adjust weight of each neighbor user sets by two algorithm.

k  ?     ? ?  ? CFiu CFiu  k )(0 )(1  ?     ? ?  ? ARiu ARiu  k )(0 )(1   Then we can get final neighbor set by sort the descending.score  C. URL association After the neighbor user set generated by algorithm above  the click record of all the users can be used as data set of association rule mining.



V. EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS Base on .NET environment, an intelligent recommender  system for digital book library is implemented. Experiments are done to test their performances. Assume user click database DT  as below:  TABLE I. USER CLICK RECORD  UserID URL  1 1,2,5  2 2,4  3 2,3  4 1,2,4  5 1,3  6 2,3    UserID URL  7 1,3  8 1,2,3,5 9 1,2,3  1) Get neighbor user set CF by collaborative filtering.

URL USER TABLE  UserID URL 1 1,4,5,7,8,9  2 1,2,3,4,6,8,9  3 3,5,6,7,8,9  4 2,4  5 1,8  User association table can be generated as Table III where minimum support is 0.5 and confidence is 0.8.

TABLE III. USER-USER ASSOCIATION  UserID UserID Minsupport Confidence 1 4,8,9 50% 100% 2 4 50% 100% 3 6,8,9 50% 100% 5 7,8,9 50% 100% 6 3,8,9 50% 100% 7 5,8,9 50% 100% 8 9 50% 100% 9 8 50% 100%  Neighbor user set of user 1 is: )}5.0,9(),5.0,8(),5.0,4{(?AR  Then we get neighbor user of 1 is {8,4,9} by using IV.B algorithm.

3) Get recommended list by URL association According to the neighbor user set, click record of  neighbor user database 'DT  can be generated by user click database .DT  TABLE IV. USER-URL TABLE  UserID URL  8 1,2,3,5  4 1,2,4  9 1,2,3  We can get URL association table as Table V where minimum support is 0.5 and confidence is 0.8.

TABLE V. URL ASSOCIATION  URL URL Minsupport Confidence 1 2 30% 100%  2 1 30% 100% 3 1 30% 100% 3 2 30% 100% 4 1 30% 100% 4 2 30% 100% 5 1 30% 100% 5 2 30% 100% 5 3 30% 100%  Browsing recorder of user 1 is {1 2 5}, recommended list is {2,1,3}-{1,2}={3},so URL 3 can be recommended to user 1.



VI. CONCLUSION AND FURTHER WORK In this paper, collaborative filtering and association rule  mining are proposed to solve the problem of low utilization and waste time in the usage of digital book. Compare with using CF or association rule alone, the neighbor set generated by the algorithm combined improved CF algorithm and user association is more meaningful.

Experiments show that the degree of personalized of system can meet users very much.

Since this system is based on the user's click data to generate recommendations message, and do not consider the contents of digital books. The further work is to design a recommended digital books library base on contents of users? browsing which can generate more meaningful recommended information.
