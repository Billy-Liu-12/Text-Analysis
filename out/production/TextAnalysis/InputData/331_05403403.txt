Positive and Negative Association Rules Applied in Coal Accidents

Abstract?In view of the forecast of the coal spontaneous combustion, an analysis model to forecast the possibility of coal spontaneous combustion was established. Then, an analysis method of positive and negative association rules based on data mining was proposed. Application of the method can mine rules from the explicit and implicit factors related to coal spontaneous combustion. It can not only overcome the weak point of the traditional association rules method which can only mine the explicit rules, but also output some more meaningful rules, providing scientific basis for controlling coal spontaneous combustion.

I. INTRODUCTION Coal spontaneous combustion is kind of complex  disasters occurred in the coal mine [1], such disasters are not only harmful to the safety of coal miner but also may lead to more serious disaster, such as gas explosion and so on.

According to statistics, nearly half of China's coal mines exists fire dangers. At present, it has not been able to take effective measures to prevent accidents of spontaneous combustion in home. Therefore, it is a most pressing problem that how to find the problem engendered from large number of spontaneous combustion incidents and analyze the reasons of the accidents, so as to help the relevant apartments to take appropriate countermeasures, reduce the probability of spontaneous combustion.

The analysis of the traditional coal spontaneous combustion almost uses Mathematical Statistics and Data Mining technologies. Such as: Zebiao Jiang [2] established the BP naval net model of coal spontaneous combustion, Junfeng Wang [3] put forward coal spontaneous combustion prediction based on gray theory, Guangjian Zhang [4] brought forward spatial data mining techniques used to build the systems of coal spontaneous combustion disaster model and so on. Analysis of these traditional technologies is not considered the potential connection of the reasons of accidents. At the same time, the impact of coal mine safety factors become more complicated, and the possibility of blind discoveries are also increased with the increase of analysis search space. So we attempted to use domain knowledge to excavate related data, mine the data and rules of non-frequent factors, in order to get a better  understanding of the coal condition and draft the appropriate countermeasures. In this regard, the analysis method of positive and negative association rules is more suitable for anglicizing accident incentives than traditional analysis methods, it simplifies effectively factors? relation and rules between frequent item sets and non-frequent item sets. It can fully display the impact extent of the accidents, it is an advanced data analysis tools.

In view of various factors that caused the coal accidents, this paper uses a method of positive and negative association rules to analyze the records of coal spontaneous combustion.

Through cleaning up a large number of original data, this method can extract the accident records associated with the coal accidents in accordance with the characteristics of incentive, establish a new accidents data table. Then, the combination of frequent fields composed of incentive fields and result fields were found from the table, and the relativity of various combination was calculated, finally pre-given support and confidence were used to measure whether the combination of frequent fields can be derived positive association rules and negative association rules or not.



II. POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE ASSOCIATION RULES  A. Algorithm of Positive and Negative Association Rules Traditional association rule algorithm is only used to  discover positive association rules, that is, it only can discover the explicit model with high frequency and strong correlation, such as A?B. In fact in the database, there are still a lot of implicit model which can not be found by current mining techniques, such as A??B, ?A?B, ?A? ?B[5], these important implicit models are negative association rules which having the properties of low frequency and strong correlation. These implicit rules tell us data items which rarely occur together, but they have very strong correlation, including valuable information.

Compared to positive association rules, negative association rules can expand the state of the affair item sets; they can not only mine the relationship between explicit attributes, but also be able to mine the relationship between explicit and implicit attributes.

2009 Second International Workshop on Computer Science and Engineering  DOI 10.1109/WCSE.2009.125   2009 Second International Workshop on Computer Science and Engineering  DOI 10.1109/WCSE.2009.125   2009 Second International Workshop on Computer Science and Engineering  DOI 10.1109/WCSE.2009.734     B. The Calculation of Correlation of Positive and Negative Association Rules Negative association rules can find the problems which  the positive association rules can't, but the contradictory association rules may be induced in the process of mining.

The reasons caused contradiction are the negative correlation contained between the item sets [6],the other possibility is independent between item sets , but the application of statistical correlation can effectively solve this problem. The positive and negative association rules is defined in the literature [7],in which the correlation of item sets A and B was expressed as follows: corrA,B=s(A? B)/s(A)s(B).

Three possible measurements of corrA,B are as the follows:  If corrA,B>1, Then A and B are positive correlation; If corrA,B=1, Then A and B are independent of each  other; If corrA,B<1, Then A and B are negative correlation; It is easy to show that the correlation of the four  association rules between A and B have such relationship as follows: If corrA,B>1, then corrA,?B<1, corr?A,B<1,corr?A, ?B>1, the reverse is also true.

Therefore, when mining the positive and negative association rules, the appearance of contradiction rules will be avoided as long as the correlation of item sets is judged.

That is, When corrA,B>1,it is  just need to mine the rules of A?B and ?A??B; when corrA,B<1, it is  just need mine the rules of ?A?B and A??B; when corrA,B=1, no rules need to mine.

After judging the correlation of item sets, all kinds of rules between item sets will be mined according to the formula of the support and confidence of positive and negative association rules.

C. The Calculation of Support and Confidence of Positive and Negative Association Rules Support and confidence is two important measurable  indicators in the positive and negative association rules. The definition is as follows:  Let I={ 1 2, , mi i i }be a set of items, let D be a transaction data set, where each transaction T is a set of items with T?I, A transaction T is said to contain A, a set of items in I, if A?T. An association rule is an implication of the form "A?B" where A?I, B?I and A?B=F. The rule A? B has a support supp in the transaction set D if s% of the transactions in D contains A?B.  The support of the rule is the probability that A and B hold together among all the possible presented cases. It shows that:  supp(A?B)=s.count(A?B)/|D|=|{T|A?B?T,T?D}|/|D| That s.count (A?B) contains the number of A?B, |D|  the panel said that the number of  D.

It is said that the rule A?B holds in the transaction set  D with confidence c if c% of transactions in D that contain A also contain B. The confidence of the rule is the conditional probability that the consequent B is true under the condition of the antecedent A.

conf(A ? B)=supp(A ? B)/supp(A)=s.count(A ? B)/s.count(A)= | {T|A?B?T, T?D} |/| {T|A?T, T?D} ||  Given D, The concourse of item sets satisfy minsupport which are given by users is frequent item sets. The problems of association rules are finding the association rules which satisfy the minconf that are given by users form frequent item sets.

Negative association rules contains item sets does not exist (non-existing-items, for example ?A, ?B), Calculating their support and confidence directly is more difficult.

Theorem 1: if A, B?I, A?B=F, then ? supp(A)=1-supp(?A) ? supp(A??B)= supp(A)- supp(A?B) ? supp(?A?B) = supp(B)- supp(A?B) ? supp(?A??B) 1-supp(A) -supp(B)+ supp(A?B) Corollary 1: if A, B, T, A?B=F, then ? conf(A??B)=(supp(A)-supp(A?B))/ supp(A)=1-  conf(A?B) ? conf(?A?B) =(supp(B)-supp(A?B))/ (1-supp(A)) ? conf(?A ? ?B)=(1-supp(A)-supp(B)+supp(A ?  B))/(1- supp(A))=1- conf(?A?B) Corollary 1 is used to calculate the confidence of  negative association rules [5].



III. THE SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION ACCIDENTS ANALYSIS BASED ON POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE ASSOCIATION  RULES  A. The Establishment of the Incentive Model of Spontaneous Combustion Accidents Through the study of historical data of Jizhong Energy  Group Company, we recognized that the reasons of coal spontaneous combustion are mainly in the following aspects: the spontaneous combustion of coal, coal moisture and so on.

The coal with spontaneous combustion tendency gradually convert into coal with spontaneous combustion through low- temperature oxidation, and once the self-ignition conditions occur, the accidents will be caused by spontaneous combustion. Based on the above factors, an analysis model to forecast the possibility of coal spontaneous combustion was established as shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1.  The analysis model  to forecast the possibility of coal  spontaneous combustion     B. Positive and Negative Association Rules Mining Based on the Incentive Model After establishing the analysis model of spontaneous  combustion accidents, we can qualitative analysis all factors in the incidents. First of all, we cleaned up the accident data of the initial records, reserving the results records which led to the incident, and established the coal spontaneous combustion accidents database, in which each record contains the time of the accidents, coal thickness, coal breadth and wind direction objective and subjective factors information and so on. After these data been clustered and discrete, we input them to the analysis system, and then we can obtain the occurrence regularity of the accidents.

Monitor staff can know which the combination of objective factors in rules set more easily lead to accidents. Part of the data was cited here, with symbols marking the various factors, as shown in table I.After these factors been classified and  symbolized, we received an input table included the incentive and consequential data, as shown in table II, there are 10 pieces record as example.

TABLE I.  DATA TABLE OF THE FACTORS  Incentive Data Symbol  Coal thickness  <0.05m 0.05-0.1m 0.1-0.15m  ?  A1 A2 A3 ?  Coal moisture  <10% 10%-20% 20%-30%  ?  D1 D2 D3 ?  Coal granularity  <10um 30um-75um 75um-1mm  ?  E1 E2 E3 ?  Wind current oxygen content  <17% 17%-30% 30%-40%  ?  H1 H2 H3 ?  Wall rock thermal conductivity  <50W/(m?K) 50-60 60-70  ?  I1 I2 I3 ?  Property damage  <5 ten thousand 5-10 ten thousand 10-15 ten thousand  ?  P1 P2 P3 ?  1) Mining data from table I  through Apriori Let minimum support minsupport = 20%, the smallest  confidence minconf = 40%, according to the proportion of each factor to all records, we calculated the support to get the first large item sets L1, as shown in table III. Then based on sets L1,we produced two candidate item sets, if we assumed they have the same minsupport, then we easily obtained the 2nd large item sets L2 as shown in table IV.

As shown in table IV, these rules are mined by the algorithm of positive association rules, such as the first rule indicates that when the coal thickness is between 0.05m and 0.1m, it easily lead to the accident whose property damage is less than 50,000yuan. The second rule indicates that when the coal thickness is between 0.05m and 0.1m. The wall  rock thermal conductivity in general in the 50-60W / (m ? K), etc.

For the item sets P1A2, corrP1,A2=s(P1 ? A2)/s(P1)s(A2)=0.2/0.6*0.7=1.43>1, This indicates P1A2 is a positive correlation, so mining rules only have P1?A2 and ?P1??A2. Then the confidence of positive and negative association rules can be calculated as: conf(P1?A2)=1>minconf, conf(? P1? ?A2)=0.75>minconf ? Therefore,P1 ? A2 is an effective positive association rules and ?P1??A2 is an effective negative association rules.

? For the item sets H3E2, corrH3,E2=s(H3 ? E2)/s(H3)s(E2)=0.6/0.6*0.7=1.11>1,This indicates H3E2 is a positive correlation, so mining rules only have H3?E2 and ?H3??E2. Then the confidence of positive and negative association rules can be calculated as: conf(H3 ? E2)=0.33<minconf ? conf(?H3??E2)=0.75>minconf.Therefore,H3?E2 is     invalid association rules and ?H3 ? ?E2 is an effective negative association rules.

? For the item sets H3A2, corrH3,A2=s (H3 ? A2)/s(H3)s(A2)=1.Therefore,H3A2 notes independent of each other, no rules.

Other item sets can be discussed in the same way.

TABLE V.  COMPARING THE NUMBER OF RULES  Algorithm Positive  association rules  Negative association  rules  Independent attributes  Total number of rules  Apiori 24 - - 24 Positive  and negative  association rules  11 39 6 56  3) The experimental results ? From the above analysis we can see that the positive  association rules sets which been mined through Apiori association rules have fraudulence to some extent, such as for item sets H3A2, support (H3A2)=30%>minsupport=20%, confidence(H3A2)=60%>minconf=40%. Here the minsupport and minconf are all meeting. However, if we calculate through positive and negative association rules ,we will find the H3A2 item sets are independent of each other, do not have rules, that is, the coal thickness and wind current oxygen content are independent of each other.

? Table V shows the number sets of rules that calculated through the Apiori and positive and negative association rules. We can see that the number of positive association rules calculated through positive and negative association rules algorithm is less than Apiori algorithm, it shows that a number of conflicting rules are removed, but also mined a lot of negative association rules, which indicates the effectiveness of positive and negative association rules. Such as the effective negative association rules ?D1 ? A2 shows that its confidence=0.67 and easily cause the accidents  when the coal moisture is greater than 10% and coal thickness is between 0.05m and 0.1m.



IV. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, through using the algorithm of positive  and negative association rules to analysis the factors of the coal spontaneous combustion accidents, we can provide a new effective analytical method. Compared to the traditional association rules, positive and negative association rules expand the condition of the accidents item sets, it can not only mine the relationship between the frequent factors, but also mine the relationship, rules and valuable information between the non-frequency factors.

Through confirmed by the experts of Jizhong Energy Group Company, the generated rules have strong practicality, can forecast a variety of hazards more accurately and provide a better theoretical basis for disaster prevention.
