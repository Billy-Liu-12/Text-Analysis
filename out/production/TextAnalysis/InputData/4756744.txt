Abstract   Along with the rapid development of the Internet,Web has become most importmant resource  of information.It is getting more difficult to fast and accurately find useful information from the gigantic amount of data provided by Web.The Web usage mining is the process inferring valuable knowledge by analyzing users? access information ,which is of great significance for better managing web sites and further developing good electronic education.In this paper we applied Galois lattice to mine Web sequential access patterns by representing  the paths traversed using graphs.An incremental and efficient mining algorithm was put forward for increasing specific day? Web log and changing transaction base.Experimental results on real- life data sets demonstrated the effectiveness of the novel algorithm.

1. Introduction   The World-Wide-Web has meraged as an important dissemination of information related to a wide range of topics.These huge amounts of data raise a grand challenge,namely, how to turn the web into a more useful information utility [1].Web mining technique is believed to be one of  methods to strike the useful information from these amounts of data on various web sites.Etzioni [2] first coined the term Web mining.He gave a definition of Web mining,as the use of data mining techniques to automatically discover and extract information from Web documents and service.Web mining is categorized into three areas of interest based on which part of the web to mine:web content mining,web structure mining and web usage mining [3].  Web usage mining is the application of data mining techniques to large user access logs in order to extract usage patterns [4].Web usage mining techniques have becomed  important for a number of applications such as web sites design,business and marketing decision support,personalization,usability studies,and network traffic analysis.It includes techniques for discovering association rules,clustering,classification,and sequential patterns mining.

The  sequential patterns mining in web server log is one of the most important issues in web usage mining.Its target is to find  frequently visited paths which is ordered by time in a web site.The discovery of  sequential patterns allows organizations to predict user visit patterns.It also help in placement of navigation bars and search engines to personalize their navigation by guiding web users to reach their target web pages rapidly. The follwing example shows the kind of  knowledge that can be discovered using the sequential patterns mining technique:starting from Yahoo?s home page,users can locate information on University in China by following either Home?Education?Higher Education?Colleges and Universities ? By Region? Countries ? China or Home ? Regional ? Countries ? China ? Education ? Higher Education.Thus,a university that wants to attract prospective students can place a navigation bar on any of the pages along the path. The sequential patterns mining inherits the mian idea of association rules mining[5],but it is more sophisticated than the association rules mining.Although a lot of work has been proposed for mining sequential patterns from web server log  including AprioriALL, GSP,PSP,G sequence and graph traversal algorithms,these algorithms have questions:the number of scanning transaction database is large;no sustaining dynamic minimum support value;redundant calculation for building frequent sequences;no incremental algorithm has been reported.In this paper,we will discuss a novell algorithm based on connecting graphs with Galois lattice for mining sequential patterns from web server log to slove four questions above.

2. Galois lattice for graphs  2.1. Galois lattice   Galois lattice has been developed during the last  twenty years by many researchers.This approach to data analysis is a method for formal representation of conceptual knowledge.Galois lattice starts with the notion of a context defined as follows[6]:  Definition 1: A context which  is defined as a triple (G,M,I) where G and M are sets while I is a binary  2008 IEEE Pacific-Asia Workshop on Computational Intelligence and Industrial Application  DOI 10.1109/PACIIA.2008.41   2008 IEEE Pacific-Asia Workshop on Computational Intelligence and Industrial Application  DOI 10.1109/PACIIA.2008.41   2008 IEEE Pacific-Asia Workshop on Computational Intelligence and Industrial Application  DOI 10.1109/PACIIA.2008.41     relation between G and M,i.e.,I ? G?M;the elements of G and M are called objects and attributes respectively,and gIm i.e.,(g,m) ? I is read:the object g has the attribute m.Frequently used are the following operators are represented by prime:  X? ? (X)={m?M|gIm for all g?X} Y?? (Y)={g?G|gIm for all  m?Y}  In the frame of a formal context (G,M,I),the philosophical view of a concept as a unit of thoughts constituted by its extension and its intension can be formalized by the following definition:  Definition 2: A pair (A,B) is said to be a formal concept of the context (G,M,I) if A ? G, B ? M, B= ? (A) and A=? (B);A and B are called the extent and the intent of the concept (A,B).The set of all concepts of (G,M,I) is denoted by B(G,M,I).

The most important structure on  B(G,M,I) is given by the subconcept-superconcept relation which is defined as follows:  Definition 3:The concept (A1,B1) is a subconcept of the concept (A2,B2) if A1 ? A2 which is equivalent to B2 ? B1,(A2,B2) is then a superconcept of (A1,B1).

2.2. Galois lattice for graphs   To mine for the web frequent access sequences traversed by the users,we can represent the paths traversed using graph.A graph is denoted by G(V,E,L),where V is the set of web pages as vertices,E is the set of hypertext links between the web pages traversed by the users as directed edges,and L is the set of labels of the graphs.The vertex set of a graph is denoted by V(G),the edge set of a graph is denoted by E(G),and each edge is denoted by an ordered pair (v1,v2),where v1 and v2 ?V(G).

Galois lattice for graph is defined as follows: (1)? :a set of the paths traversed using graphs.

(2) D:a set of  graphs where each of them represents a  set of objects from the ? .D is built using a generalization operator ? .

(3) d:a element of D which represents a set of objects from the ? .

(4) ? :the order relation G?G ?{true,false}.The order is based on the homomorphism operation.The homomorphism operation is not the same as the subgraph isomorphism,in the homomorphism mapping from G1 to G2, G2 must reflect the vertices and edges from G1 (i.e.,if (v1,v2) is present in G1, it must be present in G2 ) but G2 may have vertices and edges that are not present in G1 (i.e.,if  G2 contains (v1,v3) it might not be present in G1 ). The homomorphism operation is defined as a mapping f(v):G1?G2  such that: f(v): V(G1)?V(G2) and (f(v1),f(v2)) ?E(G2) and L(vl)= L(f(vl)).This means that  the second graph needs to contain all the pairs of related vertices contained in the first graph.For two graphs G1 and G2, G1 ? G2  iff there is a homomorphism from G1 to G2.

(5) ? :the generalization operator G?G ?D for graphs.The result of operator of two graphs  G(V,E,L) = G1(V1,E1,L1) ?  G2(V2,E2,L2) is defined by:  L  = L1? L2 V = {v|L(v)= L(v1)= L(v2)} E  = {(x,y)|(v1,v`1 ) ?E1 , (v2,v`2 ) ?E2  and L(x)= L(v1)= L(v2) L(y)= L(v`1)= L(v`2)} By this setting, a concept for graph can be defined as  follows: a set of the paths traversed using graphs i.e.? , a set of  graphs where each of them represents a set of objects from the ?  i.e. D and a concept C is a pair [Ext,Int] where  Int?D   Int = ? (Ext) = ? e ?  Ext Ext ? ?   Ext =? (Int)={ei ? ? |Int ?  ei } Obviously  we can prove that ? ( ? (Ext))= Ext.So the  pair [Ext,Int] is a concept.All the concepts are oedered by the superconcept-subconcept relation ? c:  [E1,I1] ? c  [E2,I2] iff E2 ?  E1 Also can we prove that ?  is a partial order.

The Galois lattice for graphs starts with the creation of  an empty lattice.The ?  is then added to the first level of the lattice.For the rest of the levels,new cioncepts are created using the generalization operator ? over pairs of concepts that have alreadly been found in previous steps.The process is followed to create the Galois lattice shown in figure 1:  1            2           3             4 a            a            a             b   c            c            b             d   d            b           d             a (a)          (b)  Figure 1 A Galois lattice example;(a) a set of the paths using graphs;(b)Galois lattice obtained from part (a)   {[1], a?c?d} {[2], a?c?b} {[3], a?b?d} {[4], b?d?a}  {[1 ,2],a?c} {[3 ,4],b?d}  {[1 ,2,3,4], ?  }     For example,user 1 has accessed web pages a then c and d ; user 2 has accessed web pages a then c and b in figure 1. By using the generalization operator ? over user 1 and 2,we can find that user 1 and 2 have accessed web pages a then c.

3.Algorithm for sequential patterns mining   Using Galois lattice for graphs ,the mining for web sequential patterns can be accomplished in three steps:extracting maximal forward reference paths from web server log;constructing Galois lattice for graphs from the output of the first step;discovering web closed frequent access sequences based on the result of the second step.

(1)Extracting maximal forward reference paths from web server log.

In web usage mining, we want to concentrate on the discovery of forward access sequential patterns.In other terms the access paths denoted by graphs need to be ordered,it is not possible have equivalent  graphs in the Galois lattice for graphs,i.e. it does not contain proper retracts.A subgraph G? of G is a retract of G if there is a homomorphism r:G?G?such that r(v)=v for each v?V(G?).This means that G? represents the same graph as G even when it has a smaller number of vertices.Figure 2 shows and example of a react.

G1                                   G2 Figure 2  Example of a retract: G2 is a retract of G1   Briefly,maximal forward reference (MFR) is a user  access path without backward reference.Backward reference means revisiting a previously visited web pages by the same user access. Backward reference is mainly provided for ease of traveling of not for browsing. We should filter out the effect of backward references.So MRF can be used to solve the problem such that it is a unredundant graph in the user access path. To build Galois lattice for graphs to mine for web  access sequential patterns,we first need to find all the maximal forward references.To find the MFR from the user access transaction,we used the technique described in[7],and the maximal forward reference algorithm was described in [7] .The following is an example of finding maximal forward reference from a web user access transaction.From the example,we can find that all MFRs there exist no equivalent  graphs.
