Abstract-- High voltage circuit breaker (HVCB) is one of the  most important equipments for controlling and operating in power system. In order to increase the reliability and safety of power system, it is necessary to carry on online monitoring and failure diagnosis on HVCB. However there are many difficulties in HVCB failure diagnosis. Based on fuzzy diagnosis theory, a fault diagnosis model of high voltage SF6 circuit breaker is presented in this paper. By analyzing the frequent and common failures, this paper confirms the items of online monitoring of HVCB. Moreover, it digs the relationship between the characteristic parameters and the failures. Subsequently, this paper defines the failures array, failure symptoms array and fuzzy relational matrix. Then, it gives the optimistic fuzzy operator and diagnosis rules. For improving the veracity of fuzzy diagnosis system, this paper also proposes adaptive correction methods of the fuzzy relational matrix. The fuzzy diagnosis overcomes the difficulties that expert systems obtain knowledge, and neural networks need large numbers of data to be trained.

The practical examples show that the algorithm is convenient to use, and the results are accurate. So the algorithm can be widely applied to fault diagnosis of HVCB.

I. INTRODUCTION  ig im  power  h voltage circuit breaker (HVCB) is one of the most portant equipments for controlling and operating in  system. In order to increase the reliability and safety of power systems and improve upon how utilities manage HVCB, they must be able to understand their plant performance and condition. The development of electronic technologies, sensor technologies, computer technologies, transducer technologies, signal processing techniques together with artificial? intelligence techniques has made it possible to implement online monitoring and failure diagnosis on HVCB. The items and characteristic parameters of condition monitoring are based on statistic and analyses on HVCB?s? operating and failures.

However, there are many difficulties in failures diagnosis.

For improving the veracity of failure diagnosis, this paper presents a failure diagnosis methods based on fuzzy diagnosis theory. With fuzzy diagnosis theory, a fault diagnosis model of high voltage SF6 circuit breaker is presented in this paper.

And by analyzing the frequent and common failures, this paper confirms the items of online monitoring of HVCB.

Moreover, it digs the relationship between the characteristic  parameters and the failures. From the result of failures statistics and the analysis on the important signals of HVCB?s operation, this paper defines the failures array, failure symptoms array and fuzzy relational matrix.

FUZZY DIAGNOSIS THEORY [9]  By monitoring HVCB?s operation, fault diagnosis can detect any malfunctions, thus improving performance, enhancing safety and reducing maintenance costs. However, in practice it is almost impossible to obtain a model that exactly matches the process behavior because there is mismatch between the behavior of the model and the plant. In practice, fault diagnosis based on fuzzy models may have advantages, since models of this type only attempt to capture the essential features of the behavior and can take more realistic account of the uncertainties and imprecision associated with characteristics.

Fuzzy modeling was originally proposed by Zadeh. A fuzzy diagnosis model consists of a set of production rules  which define the relationship between the characteristics and failures. The generation of a fuzzy model can be divided into structure identification and parameter estimation. Structure identification is concerned with selecting the relevant input and output variables and choosing the most appropriate form for the relationships between the variables. Parameter estimation, often called fuzzy identification, involves estimating values for the parameters which define the membership functions of the fuzzy sets, and/or the elements of a fuzzy relational array.

The fuzzy sets x1; x2; ?; xm uniformly partition the input space, and may be interpreted qualitatively as values in the range 0 to 1.0. Fuzzy characteristics vector is .

The fuzzy sets y1; y2; ?; yn uniformly partition the output space, and may be interpreted qualitatively as values in the range 0 to 1.0. Fuzzy failures vector is .

Moreover, it digs the relationship between the characteristic parameters and the failures.

Then, it gives the optimistic fuzzy operator and diagnosis rules. The fuzzy diagnosis overcame the difficulties that expert systems obtained knowledge, and neural networks needed large numbers of data to be trained. The practical examples  in this paper show that the algorithm is convenient to use, and the results are accurate. So the algorithm can be widely applied to fault diagnosis of HVCB.
