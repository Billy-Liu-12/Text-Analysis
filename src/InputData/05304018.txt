The Empirical Research on the Relationships between  Individual Differences and Psychological Contracts

Abstract?This research examines the relationships between individual differences (equity sensitivity and careerism) and psychological contracts (transactional, balanced, and relational) using knowledge employees as research participants. We test the hypothesized relationships using hierarchical regression analysis with data from a sample of 452 knowledge employees from several big cities of China. The results show that equity sensitivity is positively related to transactional psychological contract and negatively related to balanced psychological contract, and careerism is positively related to transactional psychological contract and balanced psychological contract, and negatively related to relational psychological contract.

I.  INTRODUCTION The employment relationship has undergone a number of  significant changes in recent years. In large part, this transformation has been brought about by the increasing globalization of business, by the dramatic rise in the number of mergers, restructurings, and layoffs, and by the increasing rate of change that permeates all of organizational life today [1].

Since the notion of psychological contract between employer and employee has gained currency as a means of understanding changes in the employment relationship [2], psychological contract has become increasingly important in helping to define the contemporary employment relationship [3].

Psychological contracts consist of the beliefs employees hold regarding the terms and conditions of the exchange agreement between themselves and their organizations [4].

Although psychological contracts were first discussed by organizational scholars in the 1960s, only recently have these unwritten work agreements attracted widespread attention.

Much of this attention has been generated by the perceptions that the employment relationship is undergoing a period of dramatic change and that psychological contract violations are becoming more commonplace [5]. Recent research on psychological contract has generally focused on two areas.

First, a number of articles have discussed the changing nature, contents and the types of the psychological contract. Second, another line of research has investigated the antecedents and negative consequences of psychological contract breach (or violation) on employee attitudes and behaviors. There is little attention given to the antecedents of different types of psychological contracts except some scholars? scattered works [6-8]. As to the research participants, there is no researcher to focus on knowledge employees by far. In the era of knowledge economy, knowledge employees are the most important resources of organizations. Therefore, studying issues related to knowledge employees has great practical meaning. Our paper aims to contribute to the psychological contract literature in the following area: investigating the relationships between individual differences and psychological contracts using knowledge employees as research participants.



II. PSYCHOLOGICAL CONTRACT THEORY Psychological contracts are an individual?s beliefs  regarding reciprocal obligations in an employment exchange relationship [9]. These beliefs are based on an individual?s perceptions that promises have been exchange and accepted by both parties. The psychological contract is found to serve as an important regulator of employer-employee relationships [9, 10]. Emerging empirical research suggests that the type of relationships that individuals perceive they have with their employer have important consequences for how the individuals contribute to those relationships [11].

Beginning with Macneil, scholars have proposed typologies for conceptualizing the forms that psychological contracts can take. Macneil conceptualized psychological contract on a relational-transactional continuum [4]. Rousseau proposed two key facets that would help distinguish forms of psychological contract: time frame and performance requirements. Time frame is in reference to the anticipated duration of employment (short-term vs. long-term), while performance requirements involve the connection between the rewards employment provides and performance demands (low vs. highly specified performance-reward contingencies). Rousseau used these two  Sponsored by Project of Beijing Owned Colleges and Universities?

facets to develop four types of psychological contract: transactional, relational, balanced and transitional. She operationalized the framework in Psychological Contract Inventory (PCI) [12].

Transactional contract refers to short-term or limited duration employment arrangements, primarily focuses upon economic or monetary exchange. In contrast, relational contract involves a mutually satisfying relationship with open- ended arrangements that include socioemotional as well as economic terms based upon mutual trust and loyalty. The third type, balanced contract, consists of an open-ended relational emphasis with the transactional feature of well-specified performance-reward contingencies and it is sometimes referenced as a type of ?hybrid? psychological contract [13].

Balanced contract expresses employee?s identification with his/her profession [8]. Despite coining the notion of transitional contract as a fourth type of psychological contract, Rousseau indicated transitional contract was not a psychological contract, but more of a cognitive state, which could be viewed as a total breakdown of an agreement between the employee and his/her organization reflecting the consequences of organizational change [12]. Accordingly, transactional, relational, and balanced contracts represent important types of psychological contract in employment situations.

Studies have confirmed the types of psychological contract assessed in the PCI in the United States, Singapore [12], Latin America [14], and China [15]. Additionally, Lee et al. [16] examined whether transactional, relational, and balanced contract types were relevant in China by formulating their own measure with the help of representatives from Hong Kong and the United States although they didn?t use the PCI. The findings of Lee et al. indicate the three forms of psychological contract in both countries and are consistent with the notion that contract types have similar meanings across the two cultures. Based on above empirical researches, our study intends to use PCI to operationalize the psychological contract.



III. SELECTION OF INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL ANTECEDENTS From the definition and formation of psychological  contracts, we can see that cognition plays a very critical role.

Lewis, Goodman and Fandt define cognition as ?the way that people experience, process, and interpret things around them,? and further point out, ?cognition is not completely accurate because it is influenced by many factors including individual?s experience, demand, personality and education level. Since each one has his/her special cognition, different people have different ideas when they meet the same condition or information [17].? Huseman, Hatfield and Miles also think that individual differences can lead the people to have different cognition when facing the same things because they have different preference [18]. According to their viewpoints, psychological contracts can be influenced by employee?s characteristics since individual characteristic affects people?s cognition and the cognition plays a critical role in the development of psychological contract. In this paper, we select two most representative individual-level variables of knowledge employees which are different from ordinary  employees? and investigate the relationships between these variables and psychological contract types.

After analyzing the characteristics and demands of knowledge employees, we select equity sensitivity and careerism as individual-level variables which differentiate knowledge employees from ordinary ones.

The concept of equity sensitivity was first presented by Huseman, Hatfield and Miles in 1987 which suggests that individuals react in consistent but individually different ways to both perceived equity and inequity because they have different preferences for equity [18]. People who have high equity sensitivity are outcome-oriented. They attach high importance to outcomes and they want to get more when paying the same. Knowledge employees pay much more on money, time and energy than ordinary employees since they spend more time on education and their losses of materials and chances are much more than ordinary employees?. Therefore, they hope to get high rewards quickly even if the values of their work are not so much. Besides, knowledge employees think they are superior to others and exaggerate their abilities generally for they own enormous intellectual resources. Based on the above reasons, equity sensitivities of knowledge employees should be higher than that of ordinary employees.

Careerism refers to the degree that employees view employment with current organization as a stepping stone to another one [9]. Individuals higher on careerism are more likely to perceive their current employer as an instrumental stepping stone up the career ladder [5]. As we know that knowledge employees? need levels are higher, they care the acquirements of self-worth more and they are eager to get internal satisfaction and achievement from their jobs compared with ordinary employees. Once the current jobs are not attractive enough or lack of development and promoting room, they are easy to leave the current organizations and look for new career chances. Accordingly, knowledge employees should be higher on careerism than ordinary employees.



IV. HYPOTHESIS As discussed above, those high on equity sensitivity put  great importance on outcomes. They desire to get more than others when paying the same. However, those low on equity sensitivity put more importance on their contributions in the exchange relationship and they are less sensitive to equity.

O?Neil and Mone found that equity sensitivity was negatively related to job satisfaction and organizational commitment, positively related to intention to quit [19]. Suazo investigated the relationship between equity sensitivity and psychological contract breach and the results suggested that they were positively related [20]. Thus, we can conclude that employees higher on equity sensitivity treat and evaluate what happens in the organization more negatively and they take on fewer responsibilities at work according to reciprocity principle.

Since balanced psychological contract and relational psychological contract represent the positive views that employees are willing to take on more responsibilities and    transactional psychological contract represents the negative view that employees are just willing to take on limited responsibilities in the exchange relationship with organizations, we hypothesize that:  ? Hypothesis 1a. Equity sensitivity is positively related to transactional psychological contract.

? Hypothesis 1b. Equity sensitivity is negatively related to balanced psychological contract.

? Hypothesis 1c. Equity sensitivity is negatively related to relational psychological contract.

From the concept of careerism, we can see that employees higher on careerism are more likely to view employment with current organization as a stepping stone. They have high expectations for their organizations since their needs for career development and individual promotion are very strong.

Therefore, they evaluate what their organizations give them more negatively when treated equally. Besides, in order to find good excuses, they will pay more attention to negative information of their organizations according to information processing theory and cognitive dissonance theory because they are likely to quit the current organizations at any moment when finding a better job.

Employees high on careerism are not willing to keep a long and stable relationship with current organizations. They have no affective attachments with their current jobs. The responsibilities to their organizations are not beyond what the written agreements prescribe. However, employees high on careerism have strong commitments to the careers they are engaged in since they especially care career development and individual promotion. This is consistent with what the balanced psychological contract embodies - the identification with the career. Accordingly, we give the following hypotheses:  ? Hypothesis 2a. Careerism is positively related to transactional psychological contract.

? Hypothesis 2b. Careerism is positively related to balanced psychological contract.

? Hypothesis 2c. Careerism is negatively related to relational psychological contract.

The hypothesized relationships are showed in Figure 1.

V. METHOD  A. Participates In this paper, the following two factors are considered  when operationalizing knowledge employees: (1) tasks employees assigned are finished mainly in the office and (2) employees must gain bachelor or above degrees.

Data were collected through a questionnaire survey distributed to 600 employees of some high-technology companies according with above requirements from several cities of China, including Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Hefei. In order to ensure the authenticity of responses, the questionnaire takes the form of anonymity. Out of the 600 employees surveyed, 452 employees completed the survey, a response rate of 75 percent. The sample was 36.5 percent female, 64 percent were under 30 years of age, 3 percent were over 40, 98.5 percent were graduates and above, the average total tenure was 5.2 years (SD?4.16) and the average tenure of the current job was 3.81 years (SD?3.46).

B. Measures All measures used a 5-point Likert type scale response  format (1=strongly disagree to 5=strongly agree). The reported psychological contract was measured with the revised Psychological Contract Inventory developed by Rousseau which represented the three psychological contract types of transactional and balanced, relational [12]. 24 items were included (4 items for transactional contract, 10 items for balanced contract, and 8 items for relational contract). Equity sensitivity was measured using a 5-item measure developed by Huseman, Hatfield and Miles [18]. Careerism was measured using 5-item measure developed by Rousseau [9].



VI. RESULTS Before testing the hypotheses, we examined the internal  consistencies of all scales and confirmed the existence of the three psychological contract types. The Cronbach Alpha obtained for transactional psychological contract, balanced psychological contract, relational psychological contract, equity sensitivity and careerism was 0.65, 0.91, 0.84, 0.70 and 0.54 respectively. We found that the Cronbach?s ? of careerism was much lower than 0.70. It was quite bad. The reason may be that two items of careerism measure adopt reverse-scoring and Chinese are not accustomed to answering reverse-scoring items.

After deleting two reverse-scoring items, the Cronbach?s ? became 0.70 which was in the acceptable range. Therefore, the careerism measure just kept 3 items in practice. Though the Cronbach?s ? of transactional psychological contract was lower than 0.70 slightly, it could be accepted.

Then we conducted a confirmatory factor analysis using AMOS 16.0 to confirm the existence of the three psychological contract types. We used CMIN/DF, CFI, GFI and RMSEA as key indicators of overall model fit. Values of less than or equal to 5 on the CMIN/DF, greater than or equal to 0.90 on the GFI, CFI, less than or equal to 0.08 on the RMSEA indicate good fit [21]. The CFA yielded acceptable fit indices, CMIN/DF=2.48; CFI=0.94; GFI=0.90; RMSEA=0.057. The resulting factor  Equity sensitivity  Careerism  Transactional contract  Balanced contract  Relational contract    structure showed a clean three-factor structure with all items loading on their predicted contract types.

Table 1 shows the means, standard deviations, and correlations of the variables in this study.

The control variables were entered in step 1 of the equation. These included gender, education level, age, total tenure, tenure of current job, and times of converting jobs. Here it was necessary to point out that two dummy variables were introduced to represent bachelor degree and master degree of education level respectively.

Hypotheses 1a and 2a were tested by regressing transactional psychological contract on the control variables, equity sensitivity and careerism. Hypotheses 1b and 2b were tested by regressing balanced psychological contract on the control variables, equity sensitivity and careerism. Hypotheses 1c and 2c were tested by regressing relational psychological contract on the control variables, equity sensitivity and careerism. Whether hypotheses were confirmed was through  observing regression coefficients of equity sensitivity and careerism separately.

As Table 2 shows, equity sensitivity was positively related to transactional psychological contract (?=0.342, P?0.01), negatively related to balanced psychological contract (?=- 0.205, P?0.01) and not related to relational psychological contract (?=-0.006). From Table 2, we can also see that careerism was positively related to two psychological contract dimensions - transactional psychological contract (?=0.185, P ?0.01) and balanced psychological contract (?=0.095, P? 0.05) and negatively related to relational psychological contract (?=-0.245, P?0.01). Therefore, hypothesis 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, and 2c were all supported and hypothesis 1c was not confirmed.

VII. DISCUSSION This study served the following purpose: studying the  relationships between individual differences and psychological contracts using knowledge employees as research participants.

5 of 6 hypotheses were confirmed.

The only unconfirmed hypothesis is that equity sensitivity is negatively related to relational psychological contract. The result showed that they were not related. The reasons can be explained below. As discussed above, relational psychological contracts are based upon mutual trust and loyalty and express employees? positive affections for their organizations.

However, employees high on equity sensitivity have a preference to calculate what they get and give in employment relationships and care for them very much. That is to say, equity sensitivity is rather a rational construct whose relationship with affection-related factors is not close. The score on equity sensitivity is unable to influence the affections that employees have for their organizations. Moreover, social desirability may weaken the relationship between equity sensitivity and relational psychological contract when employees answer the questionnaires.

Finally, it is important to point out the study?s limitations.

The biggest problem of this study is that data were collected at a single point in time. Thus, the use of cross-sectional research design limits the ability to make firm conclusions about cause and effect among variables in the study. Future longitudinal research is needed to confirm the conclusions drawn by this study.
