Hailstone Detection Based on Image Mining

Abstract   Hailstone is one of the main meteorological disasters and it is very difficult to be forecasted effectively. A novel method of automatic recognition hail cloud is proposed base on association rules in this paper. Firstly, the method preprocesses the original reflectivity image. Then the color features and texture features are extracted from the radar echo image.

Lastly, the association rules, which are used to distinguish hailstorm from rainstorm and super refract, are constructed, namely hail echo ensemble forecast model based on image mining is constructed. The results show that hail echo ensemble forecast model based on image mining has higher accuracy compared with the PUP products.

1. Introduction  At present, the hailstone forecast is mainly a  short-time work which is done by forecasters who have to observe many radar products. Quantities of hail echo indexes are used to analyze, judge and determine hailstorm area. Depending on the artificial pattern, it is possible to have alert failure. Also the result has much relationship to subjective experience.

With the widely use of Doppler radar, lots of radar image products are used. In this paper, to improve the accuracy of hailstorm detection, the image mining is integrated into the hailstorm detection for the first time.

Using the image mining technology [1], the implicit features and rules from the radar images can be mined, and the knowledge is formed. The experimental results validate the availability of the method.

2. The discovery of hail echo   Image mining is a process that finds a small set of knowledge (unknown and interesting pattern) previously from large amount of the image data [1].

Image mining is an essential part in process of knowledge discovery databases. Knowledge discovery in image as a process [2] is depicted in Figure.1.

The method that discovery hail echo based on  knowledge discovery in image database is proposed in this paper, it consists of an iterative sequence of the following steps:  Step 1 Image preprocessing??Create image feature database. The original image can not be directly used for mining. So the image feature database for mining knowledge must be created. It includes:  a. Format conversion??Transform the original reflectivity image to bitmap.

b.  Data cleaning??Filter noise and in consistent data.

c. Area selection and image feature extraction??Feature relevant to hailstone detection are extracted from the bitmap.

Step 2 Data mining??An essential process where data mining technology is applied in order to find out image pattern and potential knowledge.

Step 3 Pattern evaluation and interpretation??The truly interesting patterns representing knowledge are identified by support and confidence.

Finally, to support related image services, the acquired knowledge is applied such as object recognition, image classification, retrieval, etc.

3. The image feature of radar echo extraction   Supported by Special Scientific Research of Commonwealth Industry (Meteorology) (No.GYHY200706004) and Research Foundation of Urban Meteorology(No.UMRF200609)  Figure 1. Processing of knowledge discovery   DOI 10.1109/FSKD.2008.375     3.1. The color feature radar echo extraction   Color Feature reflects the perception of human visual system to the color of the physical world.

Because different color represents different reflectivity in radar images, the color features of radar echo can be used to mining the potential and interesting knowledge of hail cloud.

3.1.1. Color histogram. Color histogram is computed by discretizing the colors within the image and counting the number of pixels of each other. The histogram is a global feature of image. It can eliminate the influence of image rotation, translation and scaling.

3.1.2. Color features. The nth order moment of the sectional area is applied to express color Features of hail clouds [3].

1 Mean m??the first moment  )(  i  L  i i rfrm ?  = =              (1)  Where ?(r) is an envelope of histogram, r is a color value of a point on the envelope.

2 n order moment Definition of the nth order moment of the hail cloud  on the r-color is described as follows [4]:  )()()(  i nL  i in rfmrr ?= ?  = ?            (2)  If n=2 is selected, ?2(r) corresponds to the 2nd order moment of the sectional area equal to the measurement of contrast in gray image. It describes the envelope distribution in relation to mean. Furthermore ?2(r) describes the extent of dispersion of the gray in radar image.

If n=3 is selected, ?3(r) corresponds to the 3rd order moment of the sectional area equal to the deviation of histogram. it measures the degree of asymmetry in relation to mean. Furthermore it describes the distribution of gray-scale in the image.

If n=4, the ?4(r) is kurtosis. It characterizes the relative peakedness or flatness of the distribution compared to the normal distribution. It shows whether histogram distribution is gathered in the vicinity of average or close to the two ends. Further it describes the gray-scale contrast in the image.

Meteorology research and experience of forecaster show that the location of radar echo centre always counterparts the extreme height of hail water content.

This explains that the distribution of hail water content and development trend can be reflected effectively by radar echo strength [5]. So, another color feature that is the proportion of 45 dBz higher color frequency is extracted in the total frequency. The feature is defined as high echo proportion. It is described as follow:  ?? ==  = L  i i  L  hi ip rrh  /              (3)  The results of the experiment indicate that echo region detection based on above features is valid in radar images.

3.2. The extraction of radar echo texture features   The texture describes the relative distribution of every gray-scale image pixel, and it also reflects the changes of gray-scale or 2D colors. Therefore, the texture of image can be measured by texture features.

At present, satellite cloud textures were successful analyzed to realize the identification of various clouds (such as cumulonimbus, stratus, and cirrus) and strong convective weathers like typhoon automatically [6]. In this section, the method of gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) in statistical are introduced [7] to analyze radar image from statistical texture features.

GLCM texture based on the second-order gray level probability distribution of a texture image can be calculated by considering the relation between two pixels at a time. It reflects the integrated information of image such as direction, local area and changes in the rate [8]. For a given displacement vector ?=[?x, ?y], the probability of a reference pixel at location (x,y) having a gray level i, and the pixel at location [x+?x, y+?y] having a gray level j is represented by P(i, j|?).

Features are extracted from P(i, j|?) as follows.

1. Energy ASM??Energy is a measure of textural  uniformity of an image. It shows the amount of signal in a specific resolution. The definition is as follows:   ??= i j  jiPASM )?|,(2           (4)  When the image is not texturally uniform, many GLCM elements have a very small value, which implies that entropy is very large. So, the texture of the image is rough. In contrast, if the energy feature will have smaller value, the texture of the image is silky.

2. Contrast CON??Contrast measures the amount of local variations in an image. It expresses the clarity of image.

( )?? ?= i j  jiPjiCON )?|,(2        (5)  In images, the bigger the contrast is, the deeper the ditch of texture, the visual effect of the image will be clearer.

3. Correlation COR??Correlation is used to measure the relevance of the GLCM elements at row (line) for the similarity.

yxy ji  x jiPjiCOR ???? /)?|,())(( ,  ??= ?    (6)  And ? ?= i j  x jiPi )?|,(? , ? ?= j i  jiPj )?|,(y? ,  ? ??= i j  xx jiPi )?|,()( 2?? ,  ? ??= j i  yy jiPi )?|,()( 2??  4. Entropy ENT??Entropy is the measurement of information content of the image; it shows the disorder of an image.

)?|,(lg)?|,( jiPjiPENT i j ???=        (7)  If there is no texture in the image, the value of GLCM will tend to zero and the same is entropy. If there are full of the textures in the image, then the value of GLCM will tend to be the same and entropy becomes the highest [9]. If the texture distributes less in the image, the GLCM elements differ a lot and entropy is smaller.

5. Local Homogeneity LOC??Local homogeneity measures smoothness of an image in a local neighborhood. Here, local homogeneity measures the trends present in the singular.

])?|,(/[])?|,([ 2 ??? ?= i jj i  jiPjiPDd    (10)  In this paper, the algorithm of the features extraction based on P( i, j| ?)  is as follows:  Step1 Normalize images of image base. Before computing GLCM the images in the database are normalized. Normalization is done for all the images in the database by setting mean and standard deviation to common values.

Step2 Calculate P(i, j| ?) of echo regions, where displacement vector ?= [1, 0], [1, 1], [0, 1] and [-1, 1].

Step 3 Calculate above features of four direction vector using P( i, j| ?) ;  Step 4 Average each texture feature values of four displacement vector.

The features of different radar echo in Figure.2 are obtained in Table.1.

As shown in Figure.2 and Table.1, we know  information by texture analysis: the deeper the ditch of  radar image is, the clear the texture is, the more obvious the gradient is. It indicates that the more prominent radar echo is, and the stronger the reflectivity intensity is. Therefore, when the contrast feature of radar echo is greater, the energy feature is smaller and the entropy is larger, this radar echo is echo of hail.

4. Mining association rules   4.1. The concept of mining association rules  Association rule mining [2][10] plays an important  role in the field of data mining. It is a process of finding interesting association or correlation relationship among a large set of data items. That is, the rules must satisfy:  support > min_sup (min support) confidence > min_conf (min confidence)  Where rule support and confidence are two measures of rules interestingness. They respectively reflect the usefulness and certainty of discovered rules.

The greater the value of support is, the more frequently the rules appear in the entire data and the more universal it is. The definition of support and the credibility are as follows:  support (A?B)=P(A?B)? confidence (A?B)= P(A|B)  Where A??the former of the rules, it is condition attribution;  B??the latter of the rules, it is decision-making attribution.

4.2. Image association rules mining   The method of association rules mining based on  image [11-12] is belong to the domain of association rules, but it is different from association rules mining based on transaction database. In this paper, the main object of radar echo mining is search for the association rules of hailstone detection, the key procedures are:  Step 1 Data Selection. Selected data records from the characteristics of radar images and builds transaction table.

Step 2 Discretization of numerical attributes. By method based on discrete distance, it splits every feature attribute into equidistance intervals. Then, it maps every <attribute, interval> to a Boolean attribute.

Each of this itemsets will occur at least as frequently as a pre-determined minimum support count.

Step 4 Rules formed. Set all frequent itemsets (L1, L2, ..., Lk) as the former rules, and the type of the echo characteristics as latter rules, then rules to be formed.

Step 5 Save strong association rules from Step 4 as knowledge base (rules base).

4. 3. Results and analysis   The association rules based on radar images experiment are mined, and the part results are shown in Table.2.

Combining meteorological knowledge, the mining  results will be analyzed and compared with radar images in this paper. The knowledge is summarized as follows:  (1) The cloud area where has high reflectivity has high possibility of hail.

(2) The higher the compactness value is, the more irregular the edges of the radar echo images are. The definition of compactness is as follows:  Radio= L2/4?A Where L is the length of region; A is the area of region.

(3) The area of storm cloud is always great and the high reflectivity of storm cloud is less than hp. It indicates that the certain values of reflectivity of storm cloud have uniformity and has not levels of overall.

(4) The contrast features of super refraction region are higher than hail cloud and storm cloud regions.

5. Rule-based hail echo detection   To classify the hail echo region and detect the hail echo, the mining results of association rules based on radar images is used.

5.1. The process of automatic hail echo detection   (1) Image preprocessing and image segmentation.

(2) The automatic selection of cloud region:  a. The region labeling algorithm is applied to the segmented binary image to mark connected region in radar reflecting. And the connected regions that will not occurred strong convective weathers (such as the area is too small) in short time are filtered.

b. To detect echo region, all connected region are marked with blue rectangular boxes. It is depicted in Figure.3.

c. Connected region are Linked by chain list which  will be detected and ready for the next step process.

d. The specific cloud region is obtained and the  binary image is turned into original.

(3) Feature extraction of cloud region: The five  color and seven texture characteristics from echo region are calculated using method of section 3.

(4) Detection of cloud region: The characteristic vectors, such as the color feature and texture feature of cloud region and rules from knowledge base are used to detect cloud region. During the process of the detection, the strategy of rule-priority is applied in order to solve conflicts, that is, the condition of rule Ri is superior to rule Rj is:  ? The confidence of Ri is higher than Rj, that is: (Ri)conf  >(Rj)conf ?  ? The confidence of two rules is the same, but the support of Ri is higher than Rj, that is:  (Ri)conf =( Rj)conf ,   (Ri)sup >( Rj)sup ? ?  The confidence and the support of Ri and Rj are  the same, but Ri generates earlier than Rj.

?  Default rule should be used to classify data  objects, when the other rules are not satisfied with above conditions.

(5) Show the results: the hail cloud regions of radar images detected are marked with white rectangular boxes. The results are shown in Figure.4.

Figure 3. Echo region select results  Figure 4. Hail clouds detection results     In this paper, the test samples are composed of 15 large hail examples in all 699 images, 17 slight hail examples in all 459 images and 12 rainstorm examples  in all 594 images, which are offered by weather bureau of a city. The result obtained by Association Rules is shown in Table.3.

As shown in Table.3, 1 monomer and 2 monomers  were alert failure respectively in hail examples.

Because hail melted when falling and can not sense on the ground, 3 monomers in 459 images won?t cause disaster.

The results show that hail echo ensemble forecast model based on association rules has higher accuracy compared with the PUP products. And the hail cloud detection based on association rules satisfies practical applications. It supports forecasters to make more accurate forecasts.

6. Conclusion   (1) A novel method of image mining is proposed in  the hail detection model. And a system that is concerned on the automatic hail echo detection based on mining rules was built. This system is applied to distinguish hail cloud to rainstorm cloud and super-refraction effectively.

(2) The accuracy of the hail cloud detection is obviously higher by classifying the production rules than that by the PUP products.

(3) The system can help forecasters to make accurate forecasts.

Theoretical analysis and experiment results show that the automatic hail echo detection based on mining rules is effective. This method is a whole new route and made great contribution for the automatic hailstone detection. This research of this paper is a challenging and developing work, and is worth in-depth studies in the future.
