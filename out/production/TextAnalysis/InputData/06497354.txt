Abstract?This paper reports on the design and performance of  a new Variable Coded Modulation (VCM) system.  This VCM  system comprises eight of NASA?s recommended codes from  the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS)  standards, including four turbo and four AR4JA/C2 low-  density parity-check codes, together with six modulations types  (BPSK, QPSK, 8-PSK, 16-APSK, 32-APSK, 64-APSK).  The  signaling protocol for the transmission mode is based on a  CCSDS recommendation.  The coded modulation may be  dynamically chosen, block to block, to optimize throughput.

A novel aspect of the VCM design is that each operating mode  has a unique number of symbols in its frame.  This enables the  receiver to identify the code and modulation simply from the  number of symbols occurring between the dedicated frame  markers which occur between frames, without having to  explicitly transmit a signal to identify the operating mode.

This concept allows for a limitless selection of modes and low  complexity design.

The paper describes a MATLAB end-to-end simulation  consisting of random data generation, encoding the data,  modulation of the data, additive white Gaussian noise for  channel simulation, frame marker identification, coded  modulation mode extraction, demodulation, and decoding.

Achievable error rates and total throughput are recorded.

This simulation can be applied to any link budget that  describes the signal to noise ratio over time and can selectively  use all or some of the supported coded modulation modes.

The simulations show that for a representative low-Earth orbit  satellite which encounters a 15 dB variation of symbol SNRs in  a 10 minute pass, VCM doubles the achievable throughput,  compared to the optimal fixed-mode communication.  This  simulation shows that VCM is a major and practical method  for communicating high data volumes from space.
