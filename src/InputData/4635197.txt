Association Rule Mining for Project Performance Measurement of  Technology Transfer Centers in Thailand

Abstract?In Thailand, there are many Technology  Transfer Centers (TTC) located in every district of the country.

However, the evaluation of their performance is difficult and complex since TTCs are different in size, location, type of training and expertise. Accordingly, the study of TTC project performance in Thailand is scanty due to the limitations of confidentiality. This study uses data mining techniques to analyze historical data of project profiles from Technology Transfer Centers (TTC) in Thailand. TTC data are segmented into groups according to their performance. This method is used to separate value centers from the inactive ones. Then Apriori algorithm is applied to find the relationships within TTC features and project profiles of clusters having different performances. The results of this study will benefit the organization in exploiting it to bring about a competitive advantage and being able to improve the efficiency of TTC as well as its application to strategic planning.

I.  INTRODUCTION  Data mining is the process of automatically discovering useful information or knowledge in large scale data sets.  It includes four tasks: predictive modeling, cluster analysis, association analysis and anomaly detection. Predictive modeling is used to build a model for the target variable as a function of explanatory variables. Two types of predictive models include classification (discrete variables) and regression (continuous variables). Cluster analysis is used to find groups of closely related observations. The most similar data are grouped into clusters. Association analysis is used to find patterns that describe strongly associated features in the data. Lastly, anomaly detection is used to identify observations whose characteristics are significantly different from the rest of the data [1]. Among these techniques, association analysis has been studied by researchers since it can be used to find the relationships between attributes of the given data sets in various applications such as web learning courseware, learning recommender, and software projects.

Chen?s  study [2] applies the association rules of the common learning misconceptions to adjust courseware structure of web-based learning by modifying the difficult  parameters of courseware in its database. Experiment results reveal that the use of the proposed learning diagnosis approach can correctly discover learners? common learning misconceptions according to their profile and help them to learn more effectively.

Mei-Hua Hsu [3] has developed an online personalized English learning recommender system capable of providing ESL (English Standard Learning) students with reading lessons that fit their different interests and therefore increase the motivation to learn. The system, using various techniques includes content-based analysis, collaborative filtering, and data mining technique: association rule. These techniques analyze students? reading data and generate recommender scores, to help students in selecting appropriate lessons. The system had been tested for one year, and it is claimed to be useful in heightening ESL learners? motivation and interest in reading.

In Moreno Garc?a?s  work [4], a method for mining association rules that relate to project attributes was proposed.

This work deals with the problem of discretizing continuous data in order to generate a manageable number of high confident association rules. The method was verified by applying it to data from a Software Project Simulator. The association model obtained allows users to estimate the influence of certain management policy factors on various software project attributes.

TTCs are the technology transfer centers situated in Thailand since 2000. At present there are about 6000 TTCs in Thailand, there is one TTC for each Tumbon (sub district) all over Thailand. The primary task of TTC is providing training or transferring technology to local people in each assigned area (Tumbon). Every month, TTC officers have to submit reports to the main office in Bangkok through the internet.

This report includes the details on their technology transfer activities that have been performed. Because of the volume of data to be processed in every year, it is very difficult to measure the performance of TTCs.

Srimongkolpattana et. al [5] proposed data mining techniques, SOM and Fuzzy C-Means algorithms to cluster TTCs in Thailand on their project performance. Results showed that TTCs are clustered into six groups. The majority of TTC project performance are in average and low levels, as well some are above average. By these techniques the      characteristics or factors that are related in each cluster are unknown.  There are questions, on which attributes relate to the high or low performance of TTCs.

It is the objective of this study to propose an approach to measure TTC performance and to use data mining technique: association rules to find the relationships of attributes in clustered TTCs according to their performance.

This paper is divided into 5 Sections. Section 2 includes related theories on the study, Section 3, the research method, Section 4 the results of the study and lastly, Section 5 the conclusion.



II. RELATED THEORY  Association analysis was used for finding relationships of features in large databases. It is commonly used for predicting or analyzing customer purchase called    ?Market Basket Analysis?.   This task is performed by using Association Rule mining algorithm to break down the problem into subtasks.

For example, in a grocery store, the customers always buy (1) bread and milk (2) bread, diapers, beer and eggs (3) milk, diapers, beer and Cola (4) bread, milk, diapers, and beer and (5) bread, milk, diapers, and Cola. By applying the association rules, it suggested that a strong relationship exists between the sales of diapers and beer, because many customers who buy diapers also buy beer ({Diapers} ? {Beer}).

The Apriori algorithm [6] is an association rule algorithm which is commonly used in business products. This algorithm extracts the frequent item sets from candidate item sets by removing item sets with support values less than minimum support in each iteration. A detailed description of this method will not be presented in this paper, instead only parameters that affect their operation characteristics and performance are described. The reason why this study selected Apriori algorithm for using association rules as a data mining method is based on the following arguments.

Apriori algorithm has been regarded as the most popular and most widely used procedure for finding association between attributes which are related in the given data set. Apriori algorithm is as follows.

Let I = I1, I2, . . ., Im is a set of m distinct attributes, T is transaction that contains a set of items such that T ?  I, D is a database with different transaction records. An association rule is an implication in the form of X ? Y, where X, Y ?  I are sets of items called item sets, and X ? Y =? . X is called antecedent while Y is called consequent, the rule means X implies Y.

There are two important basic measures for the association rules, named support (s) and confidence (c) [7], which can be defined as follows. The support (s) of an association rule is the ratio of the records that contain X ?  Y to the total number of records in the database, and formulated as follows:  Support (X ?Y , T)  =  Support (X ? Y) For a given number of records, confidence (c) is the ratio  (in percent) of the number of records that contain (X ? Y) to the number of records that contain X, and formulated as follows:  Conf (X ?Y, T) = )(  )( XSupp  yxSupp ?    Step 1: Find all sets of items, which occur in a frequency  that is greater than or equal to the user specified threshold support (s).

Step 2: Generate the desired rules using the large item set, which has user-specified threshold confidence (c).

Step 3: Verify the discovered rules using the certainty factor to judge whether the discovered rules are very strong rules or not.



III. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY  There are four steps in the study: (1) Data preprocessing, (2) calculating performance score (3) clustering and (4) association rule mining (Figure 1).

Fig. 1. Framework of the study    1. Data Pre-processing  First step is the collection of TTC data residing in SQL database.  Data are gathered from different tables. Then, data cleaning is performed to remove incomplete, noisy and inconsistent data. Lastly, data are transformed to be used with a statistical software package.

In this study, 77,911 transactions (in Year 2005) obtained from the working data of TTCs in Thailand. The Center Profile and Activity Profile are two components of data sets retrieved from the database. The Center Profile consists of general data of TTC, such as Subdistrict ID, District ID, Province ID, Zone and others. While, Activity Profile is the work practices of TTC in each month.

Attributes in Activity Profile includes 1)  Technology Transfer Activity (Activity) which is the  number of technology transferred activities organized in one TTC per month. They are divided to 5 groups.

G1:No activity G2: 1 activity G3: 2 activities G4: 3 activities G5:  More than 3 activities  2) Agriculturist Target (Target) which is the number of  participants attending each training. They are divided to 5 groups.

G1:No participant G2:1-50  participants G3:51-100 participants  G4:101-150 participants  G5: More than 151 participants   3)  Project-Expected (PE) is the difference between actual  technology transferred and planned projects. They were divided to 5 groups.

G1: Less than -1   G2:  -1 G3: 0 G4: 1 G5:  More than 1    4)  Target-Expected (TE) is the different between actual and expected participants attending in one training. They were divided to 5 groups.

G1: Less than -50    G2: -50 to -1 G3: 0 G4: 1 to 50 G5:  More than 50  5)  Committee meetings (Meeting) is the meeting provided  at ATSC in one month. They were divided in 5 groups.

G1: No meeting   G2:  1 time G3: 2 times G4: 3 times G5:  More than 3 times  6)  Report submission (Report) is the total number of  reports sent to the headquarters the website. It was divided in 5 groups.

G1: No report    G2:  1-5 reports G3: 6-10 reports G4:11-15 reports G5:  16-20 reports Attributes 2 to 6 were used to calculate Pscore for this  study.

2. Calculation of  Project Performance Score (Pscore) Pscore is the summation of the selected features in the  data set. There were five selected features in TTCs, they included (1) number of participants in training (Target);  (2) the difference between expected and actual technology transfer projects (TE); (3) the difference between expected and actual participants in technology transfer projects (PE); (4) number of project meetings (Meeting) and (5) Report submission (Report).  The features of each Center were evaluated based on a 5 point scale ranging from 1 to 5 (1 is the lowest and 5 is the highest).  Then the p score was computed from the five factors as shown in equation 1.

Pscore = summed score of (Target + PE + TE +  Meeting + Report) (1)  3. Clustering data based on Pscore  Clustering is a division of data into clusters of similar objects. Each cluster consists of objects that are similar between themselves and dissimilar to objects of other clusters. The technique to define the clusters were Partitioning method, Hierarchical methods, Density-Based methods and Grid-Based methods [1].

In this step, the calculated Pscore of each TTC from Step 2 was classified into five levels including very high, high, above average, average, and low.  The Pscore was ranged from 1 to 25 since there were five factors and each factor value was between 1 (low) to 5 (high). Table 1 depicts Pscore divided into 5 levels.

Table 1. Clustered data according to Pscore   Type Pscore value level 1 (low) less than  12 level 2 (average)  between  12 to 14 level 3 (above average) between  15 to 16 level 4 (high) 17 to 19 level 5 (very high) 20 to  25   After each TTC was clustered into distinctive level  according to their performance, the association analysis of features in each cluster was conducted to find the relationships of its features.

4. Association rules  Apriori algorithm was used for association rule mining algorithm. In each cluster, the candidate features of TTC were generated by Apriori algorithm and then the relationships of features were proposed.

TTC features  There were 18 features including situational characteristics, task characteristics, some from activity profile (Table 1) and Pscore.  Table 2 shows 18 attribute names and the description of each cluster used to find their relationships by the association rule.

IV. RESULTS  In the 6600 TTCs, there were a total of 77,911 transactions submitted to TTC main office in Thailand for the year 2005.  TTCs were clustered into five levels according to their project performance as shown in Table 3. The level average performance (score 12-14) is the majority (50.39%), above average (36.7%), good (10.21%), low (1.62%), and the level very high performance (20-25) was the smallest (0.99%). It means that the majority of the TTCs performance was in average level while very few represent high performance (0.99~ 1%).

Measures were  Support, Confidence and Lift.

The results of the association rule for low performance TTC: Cluster 1 is shown in Table 4.

Table 4  The discovered association rules for Cluster 1:  low performance (where S, C and L indicate the values of support, confidence and lift for each discovered rule, respectively (support =  0.3 and confidence = 0.71, lift >= 1 )   id The discovered association rules S C L 1 1-5 Reports/month ?low  Pscore 0.8 1 1  2 1-25 participants  ? 1-5 Reports/month  0.7 0.86 1.03  3 training  time was Jan-March and period was 1-5 days ?target was accomplished with 1-5 reports  0.3 0.94 1.24  4 TTC are  4-6      years old ? target was accomplished with low Pscore  0.3 0.9 1.03  5 Activity was 1  ?  produces  1- 5 reports  0.3 0.85 1.02   Table 4 shows the relationships of activities in Class 1  (low performance) when using minimum Support as  0.3 and Confidence as 0.71 and Lift as 1. There were five selected rules from 29 rules. The discovered rules included Pscore was low, TTC age was about 4-6 years, activity was production, activity type was production, transfer content was rice, training was 1-5 days, and trainning period was January to March.  The attributes of working activities including target were 1-25 participants, no project meeting, submitted reports were 1-5, the target participants and activities of technology transfer were accomplished, activity was one.

Results showed that the very high performance Cluster had Pscore more than 20, and had more than 25 participants in training. The committee meeting was one time/month.

Submitted reports were 16-20 per month. While training time was July to September. There were two actual projects more than expected projects.  The TTC were seven years old. There were two training projects per month. These centers were located in the northeastern provinces of Thailand.

On the other hand, the low performance TTC had lower than 12 score of a total of 25 scores.  In each month there were no committee meeting, 1-5 submitted reports from total 20 reports, technology transfer was one project, TTC was 4-6 years old, and working period was in January to March.



VI. CONCLUSIONS  This study was proposed as an approach to segment TTC into different clusters by using performance scores which were calculated from the number of participants, difference of actual and expected targets, difference of actual and expected activities, number of meetings and reports. Then, TTCs were ranked into 5 clusters: low, average, above average, high, and very high according to their Pscores. In each cluster, project profile and performance attributes were used for association rule mining.

Results revealed that TTCs with high performance were seven years old which had more experience in working, and had more committee meetings which were good indicators of team work and knowledge transfer. These characteristics resulted in more reports submitted to the headquarter. The technology transfer time was July to September which is the rainy season in Thailand.

The proposed approach can discover TTC activities and characteristics according to performance measurements of project activities. The obtained association rules for TTC activities can be applied to improve TTC project management through modifying the difficulty parameters of TTCs with low score. Moreover, the proposed system also offers a total in management strategy based on the discovered factors to promote good working performance. Results indicate that the proposed method can precisely discover relationships of factors in each identified cluster with different work performances.
