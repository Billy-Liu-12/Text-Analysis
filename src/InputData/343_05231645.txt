Fuzzy partition

ABSTRACT: Pulping process is an important link in paper industry. To control the pulping time and get homogenized and well-proportioned pulp, pulper was improved by an expert system based on BP network and fuzzy controller. Pulp consistency and variation concentration are the inputs and pulping time is the output of the system. By empirical data, membership functions of consistency, variation concentration and pulping time were set up and sixteen fuzzy control rules were made. Combined with BP network, the number of input neurons was fourteen and the number of output neurons was eight. All control rules were training samples and simulation was completed by MATLAB.

The results show that comparing with traditional fuzzy controller, capacity of the expert system is improved because of the memory and association of BP network. So the expert system can get knowledge directly from experience and reason automatically, without time-consuming searching in tables. The expert system has been used for about one year in Sichuan Hongyuan Group and the capacity can be used as needed.

I.  INTRODUCTION In modern paper industry, pulp consistency is an  important factor that affects not only absolute dry fiber quantity but also paper quality [1]. And at the same time, pulp consistency is also a factor significantly affected by production process. So the eyes of all papermaking enterprises are on the homogenization and quality of pulp.

Traditional fuzzy controller simulates thinking mode and reasoning rules of human by fuzzy logic to control nonlinear time-varying system. These fuzzy control systems have been widely used in engineering communities. According to the published literatures, however, traditional fuzzy control  systems cannot assure optimal or suboptimal performances because control rules mainly come from the experience of designers and operators.

In this paper, we will introduce the designing of a fuzzy expert system, which can control pulping time and get high quality pulp, by combining artificial neural network (ANN) with fuzzy control system. The fuzzy expert system can work automatically based on control rules and it is good at learning ability and parallelism, without complex rules searching and reasoning.



II. OVERALL DESIGN  A. Analysis of Technological Process In classic technological process, usually there are three  links to control pulp consistency: pulper, pulp storage, and head box [1]. Pulping is the most important link of them because it greatly determines later links and pulp quality.

Variation of pulp concentration is another important parameter, which has relationship to the materials and reflects the utilization of materials [2]. Therefore it also affects pulping time. Now in paper industry, pulping time usually depends on experience or sensory analysis. So it often leads to biggish fluctuation of pulp quality.

B. Holistic Structure Diagram Based on analysis of technological process, we  redesigned the fuzzy controller [3-7]. Fig. 1 is the structure diagram of the expert system based on fuzzy ANN. Pulp consistency and variation concentration are the inputs of system, and the output is pulping time.

Concentration Sensors Concentration sensors have great affect on accuracy and  real-time performance of the expert system. Considering the material, consistency and accuracy, pulp will be diluted before measuring the consistency [7].

Concentration sensors consist of LEDs and phototransistors. Light intensity sent by LED is received by phototransistor and phototransistor transforms it to voltage.

Microcomputer will decide the transmittance of pulp according to the voltage. Assume the transmittance of clear water is I1 and the corresponding voltage is V1. Accordingly, the transmittance of pulp is I2 and the corresponding voltage is V2. Remaining the light intensity constant, the following equation can be proved [8]:       V V  I I =  (1)  According to Lambert-Beer law, pulp consistency can be calculated by I2.



III. DESIGN OF FUZZY CONTROLLER The fuzzy controller is the most important unit of the  system [9-10]. Comparing with traditional fuzzy controllers, the main improvement is that BP network is introduced into fuzzy controller to remember, reason and associate with fuzzy control rules. For those not appearing inputs, the improved fuzzy controller can generate suitable outputs to control pulper by memory and association, with a powerful adaptive ability.

A. Fuzzy Words Set and Membership Function Considering performance of the controller, we defined  fuzzy words set of consistency as {clear, less turbid, turbid, heavy turbid} and fuzzy words set of variation concentration as {zero, little, middle, large}. Fuzzy words set of pulping time was defined as {less short, short, standard, long} [11-12].

Membership functions were set up mainly by the experience of operators. Fig.2 is the membership function of consistency and Fig. 3 is that of variation concentration.

Fig.4 is membership function of pulping time. Then we can get the fuzzy subsets of input and output parameters, described as table I.

B. Fuzzy Control Rules Based on fuzzy words sets and membership functions,  we draw up 16 fuzzy control rules for the system. See table II for the results.



IV. SIMULATION AND RESULT To test the performance of the fuzzy controller, we  choose BP network to simulate it by MATLAB. Assume X is the input vector and Y is the output vector. The number of input neurons is 14, from x1 to x7 for fuzzy subset of consistency and from x8 to x14 for fuzzy subset of variation concentration. The number of output neurons is 8, from y1 to y8 for fuzzy subset of pulping time. According to Kolmogorov criterion, the number of interlayer is 29. Each control rule corresponds with one training sample. For example, when consistency is clear and variation concentration is zero, pulping time is short. According table I, X=[1, 0.6, 0.1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.0, 0.5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]T, Y=[1.0, 0.5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]T. Analogously, we can get the other training samples. Assume P is the input sample matrix and T is the output sample matrix, the main parameters of simulation can be described as follow: net=newff(minmax(P),[29,8],{?tansig?,?logsig?},?traingdx?); net.trainParam.epochs=1000; net.trainParam.goal=0.001; net=train(net,P,T); Y=sim(net,P);  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  0.5  1.0    Consistency   Figure 2.

TRAINGDX,Epoch 268/1000,MSE 0.00092684/0.001, Gradient 0.00216257/1e-006 TRAINGDX,Performance goal met.

The results show that the errors meet the need of requirement after 268 times training. The performance of the fuzzy controller is stable with high control precision.



V. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we combined ANN with fuzzy control  theory and designed an expert system for pulping.

Comparing with traditional fuzzy controller, the main improvements are: 1) the system can get knowledge directly from experience and set up fuzzy rules and membership functions automatically; 2) the output of controller can be got by on-line calculating, without time-consuming searching in tables; 3) for the not appearing samples, the controller can generate suitable outputs, with a powerful capacity of memory and association. The system has been applied in the production lines of Sichuan Hongyuan Group for about 1 year and the performance can be used as needed.
