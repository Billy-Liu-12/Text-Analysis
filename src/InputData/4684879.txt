Abstract? Protein sequence motifs information is crucial  to the analysis of biologically significant regions.  The conserved regions have the potential to determine the role of the proteins.  Many algorithms or techniques to discover motifs require a predefined fixed window size in advance.

Due to the fixed size, these approaches often deliver a number of similar motifs simply shifted by some bases or including mismatches.  To confront the mismatched motifs problem, we use the super-rule concept to construct a Super-Rule-Tree (SRT) by a modified HHK clustering which requires no parameter setup to identify the similarities and dissimilarities between the motifs.  By analyzing the motifs results generated by our approach, they are not only significant in sequence area but secondary structure similarity.  We believe new proposed HHK clustering algorithm and SRT can play an important role in similar researches which requires predefined fixed window size.

I. INTRODUCTION rotein sequence motifs are gathering more and more attention in the field of sequence analysis.  These recurring  patterns have the potential to determine a protein?s conformation, function, and activities.  In order to identify these motifs, most of the enumerative algorithms in Bioinformatics research area need to specify the size of the motif in advance.  Because of the fixed size, they often deliver a number of similar motifs (1)including mismatches or (2)shifted by one base [1], which is problematic.  The first problem implies that some group motifs may be similar to one another.  The second problem probably can be more easily seen in this way: If there exists a biological sequence motif with length of 12 and we set the window size to 9, it is highly possible that we discovered two similar sequence motifs where one motif covers the front part of the biological sequence motif and the other one covers the rear part.  In this paper, we deal with the first problem and manage the second  one in succeeded future work.

We deal with the ?including mismatches? problem by use  the Super-rules concept [2] to cluster those motifs and find the similarities among them.  Two of the most popular algorithms for distance-based clustering are Hierarchical clustering [3] and K-means clustering [4].  According to Hu et al [5], many improvements to these two famous clustering algorithms have been proposed [6-10]; however, they adapt our Hybrid Hierarchical-K-means (HHK) clustering algorithm [11], which directly combines the two classic methods and yield good results.  In this paper, we proposed the latest version of HHK, which requires no predefined parameters, to further improve the algorithm.

In our previous work [23], we identified 343 high quality protein sequence motifs which transcend protein family boundaries.  Based on the fact that some motifs maybe similar to one another, we try to further discover the relation between these motifs.  Therefore, the Hybrid Hierarchical-K-means (HHK) clustering algorithm is applied to discover super-rules and construct Super-Rule-Tree (SRT) structure.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows.  Section 2 gives the data mining techniques including association rule, clustering, super-rule concepts and a novel positional association rule algorithm.  Section 3 discusses how we setup the experiment with the new algorithm. Results and conclusions are given in section 4 and section 5.



II. NOVEL HYBRID HIERARCHICAL K-MEANS (HHK) CLUSTERING ALGORITHM   Clustering is a technique to divide datasets into several  subsets whose elements share similar attributes.  Among clustering algorithms, Hierarchical and K-means clustering are the two most popular and classic methods.  However, both have their innate disadvantages. Hierarchical clustering cannot represent distinct clusters with similar expression patterns.

Also, as clusters grow in size, the actual expression patterns become less relevant.  K-means clustering requires a specified number of clusters in advance and chooses initial centroids  Protein Sequence Motif Super-Rule-Tree (SRT) Structure Constructed by Hybrid Hierarchical  K-means Clustering Algorithm Bernard Chen12 , Jieyue He 23 , Steven Pellicer 2  and Yi Pan 2  1 University of Central Arkansas, Computer Science Department, USA 2 Georgia State University, Computer Science Department, USA  3 Southeast University, Computer Science Department, China Email: bchen3@cs.gsu.edu  P   DOI 10.1109/BIBM.2008.11       randomly; in addition, it is sensitive to outliers.

We present a hybrid approach to combine the merits of the  two classic approaches and discard disadvantages we mentioned.  A brief description of HHK clustering algorithm follows.  First, we carried out agglomerative hierarchical clustering and let the program stop at a certain terminal point (a user defined percentage which is determined by the whole clustering process carried out by hierarchical clustering). From the clusters generated from hierarchical clustering, we computed the mean value of each cluster as the initial point for k-means to obtain the initial centroid. Also, the number of clusters generated from hierarchical clustering is k-mean?s number of clusters. After that, we worked on k-means clustering with which every cluster MUST at least contain the same objects generated from hierarchical clustering. This is due to the fact that hierarchical clustering had already put objects that were very close with one another into clusters, and the goal of k-means clustering is to put close objects together, which is in the same direction as what hierarchical clustering accomplished. Therefore, we can trust the results of hierarchical clustering.

We apply HHK clustering algorithm for super-rules [2] generation in this paper.  In order to avoid human intervention and let the Super-rule present the original data nature, we modified our HHK clustering algorithm to become a fully parameter-free algorithm.  The original HHK required q user to decide when to stop the hierarchical clustering and proceed to K-means clustering.  Since the role of HHK clustering algorithm is to generate the super-rules, the results of the clustering should be as detailed as possible.  Therefore, the approach we propose to avoid the parameter setup is to let the agglomerative hierarchical clustering complete execution, and we record the number of clusters it generated.  After that, we carry out the HHK clustering algorithm and let the hierarchical clustering stop when it generates the largest number of clusters.  The reason for this process is that while the hierarchical clustering stops at the point we mentioned, the HHK clustering may generate the largest number of super- rules as well as the most detailed information.  We may apply the HHK on the super-rules again to generate super-super- rules if necessary.  By this manner, we can form a Super- Rules-Tree (SRT) structure.    The HHK clustering is summarized in Figure 1   (1) Finish a complete agglomerative Hierarchical clustering on  the data and record the number of clusters generated during the process.

(2) Run the agglomerative Hierarchical clustering again and stop the process when the largest number of clusters is generated.

(3) Execute the K-means clustering on the remaining data which are not processed in step (2).  Use centroids in every cluster generated in step (2) as the initial centroids in the K-means clustering algorithm.

III. EXPERIMENT SETUP  A. Dataset The original dataset used in this work includes 2710 protein  sequences obtained from Protein Sequence Culling Server (PISCES) [5]. It is the dataset that we used in [12, 13] to generate protein sequence motifs.  No sequence in this database shares more than 25% sequence identity. The frequency profile from the HSSP [3] is constructed based on the alignment of each protein sequence from the protein data bank (PDB) where all the sequences are considered homologous in the sequence database. For the frequency profiles (HSSP) representation for sequence segments, each position of the matrix represents the frequency for a specified amino acid residue in a sequence position for the multiple sequence alignment.  We also obtained secondary structure from DSSP [4], which is a database of secondary structure assignments for all protein entries in the Protein Data Bank.

DSSP originally assigns the secondary structure to eight different classes. In this paper, we convert those eight classes into three based on the following method: H, G and I to H (Helices); B and E to E (Sheets); all others to C (Coils).

343 different sequence motifs with window size of nine generated from original dataset [14] are included in this paper.

Each window corresponds to a sequence segment, which is represented by a 9 ? 20 matrix plus additional nine corresponding representative secondary structure information.

Twenty rows represent 20 amino acids and 9 columns represent each position of the sliding window.

B. Dissimilarity Measure According to [1, 2], the city block metric is more suitable  for this field of study since it will consider every position of the frequency profile equally. The following formula is used to calculate the dissimilarity between two sequence  segments[2]: Dissimilarity= ( ) ( )?? = =  ? L  i  N  j ck jiFjiF  1 1 ,,   Where L is the window size and N is 20 which represent 20  different amino acids. Fk(i,j) is the value of the matrix at row i and column j used to represent the sequence segment. Fc(i,j) is the value of the matrix at row i and column j used to represent the centroid of a give sequence cluster.  The lower dissimilarity value is, the higher similarity two segments have.

C. Structural Similarity Measure Cluster?s average structure is calculated using the following  formula:   ws  ppp ws  i CiEiHi?  =1 ,,, ),,max(    Where ws is the window size and Pi,H shows the frequency of occurrence of helix among the segments for the cluster in position i. Pi,E and Pi,C are defined in a similar way. If the       structural homology for a cluster exceeds 70%, the cluster can be considered structurally identical [7]. If the structural homology for the cluster exceeds 60% and lower than 70%, the cluster can be considered weakly structurally homologous [1].

D. HSSP-BLOSUM62 Measure BLOSUM62 [14] is a scoring matrix based on known  alignments of diverse sequences.  By using this matrix, we may tell the consistency of the amino acids appearing in the same position of the motif information generated by our method. Because different amino acids appearing in the same position should be close to each other, the corresponding value in the BLOSUM62 matrix will give a positive value.  For example, if the rule indicates amino acid A1 and A2 are two elements frequently appear in some specific position; A1 and A2 should have similar biochemical property.  Hence, the measure is defined as the following:   If k = 0:          HSSP-BLOSUM62 measure = 0 Else If k = 1:  HSSP-BLOSUM62 measure = BLOSUM62 ij Else:           HSSP-BLOSUM62 measure =  ? ?  ? ? ?  = +=  ?  = +=  ?  ??   1 1   1 1   k  i  k  ij ji  k  i  k  ij ijji  HSSPHSSP  BLOSUMHSSPHSSP  k is the number of amino acids with frequency higher than a certain threshold in the same position ( in this paper, 8% is the threshold).  HSSPi indicates the percent of amino acid i appearing.  BLOSUM62ij denotes the value of BLOSUM62 on amino acid i and j.  The higher HSSP-BLOSUM62 value indicates more significant motif information.  When k equals zero, it indicates that there is no amino acids appearing in the specific position, so the value for this measure is assigned zero.  While k equals one, it indicates that there is only one amino acid appearing in the position.  In this case, we assign the corresponding amino acid?s diagonal value in BLOSUM62.

E. HSSP-BLOSUM62 Gain In order to evaluate the cluster results, we proposed a new  evaluation method called ?HSSP-BLOSUM62 GAIN.?  The idea comes from the fact that when we use Positional Association Rule algorithm to link two or more motifs, we cannot gain or lose any secondary structure similarity on each position of the new motif.  This is because the computation of secondary structure similarity on each position considers all participated members; therefore, the value simply equals the average value.  On the other hand, while the motifs are linked together, the noticeable amino acids on each position are changed.  Under the circumstance of not sacrificing secondary structure similarity, we try to use this measure to show that our clustering results do not loss bio-chemical significant either.  The ?HSSP-BLOSUM62 GAIN? value is calculated by the increase of the new motif?s overall HSSP-BLOSUM62 value minus the average of all participated motifs? overall  HSSP-BLOSUM62 value.



IV. RESULTS  A. Super-Rule-Tree (SRT) In Zhong?s work [15], 253 sequence motifs with high  structural similarities are revealed by their improved K-means clustering algorithm with the fixed window size 10, and those motifs are grouped into 27 major patterns according to their common characteristics.  This suggests that many motifs are similar to one another.  Since the dataset we used is very similar to [15], we both selected from PISCES [16] (our PISCES list was more updated) and expended by HSSP , we believe that our results which come from our Fuzzy Greedy K- means (FGK) model [17] should have a similar trend.

Therefore, we perform HHK clustering algorithm on our 343 motifs for Super-Rule-Tree generation.  As we discussed in section 2A, we carry out a complete hierarchical clustering and record the number of clusters generated during the process as shown in Figure 2.

It is clear that a peak is found during 33.63% of the clustering and it generated 69 clusters.  After we obtain this information, we may start the HHK clustering: initially, we run the hierarchical clustering until 69 clusters are generated; after that, by using the center of these 69 clusters as the initial centroids, we run K-means clustering algorithm for the remaining motifs (the motifs that have not been clustered yet).

After 69 level-1 super-rules are generated, since the number of super-rules is still large, we perform another HHK clustering.

Figure 3 is the analysis of when to stop the Hierarchical clustering.

Figure 4 The Super-Rule-Tree (SRT) of 343 different sequence motifs   After 69 level-1 super-rules are generated, since the number of super-rules is still large, we perform another HHK clustering on it.  Figure 3 is the analysis of when to stop the Hierarchical clustering.  Based on Figure 3, we run Hierarchical clustering algorithm for 61.19% and it generates 11 clusters.  In the end, we construct a SRT as shown in Figure 4.

By further analysis of the Super-Rule-Tree, we made note that the result of level 1 super-rule is grouping motifs with similar sequences (protein primary structure) and we also made note that all groups share common secondary structures; the outcome of level 2 super-rule is more likely to put motifs with similar secondary structure into groups.  We mark representative 2nd structure on the level 2 super-rules in Figure 4: Helix (H), Coil ?, Coil-Helix (CH), Helix-Coil (HC), Coil- Sheet (CE), Sheet-Coil (EC), Coil-Sheet-Coil (CEC), and Sheet-Coil-Sheet (ECE).  More specifically, a representative secondary structure identified as Helix (H) when all of a motif?s secondary structures are Helix (same logic applies to C), and a complex folding like ?CH? means that the secondary structures of a motif are initially composed of Coil and then turn to Helix.  Considering level 2 super-rules, all have a very consistent representative 2nd structure except super-rule number three, which is a group of mixing Coils and Sheets.

These results suggest that the Super-Rule-Tree (SRT) gives a good overlook of the large amount of rules (motifs); people can easily recognize the similarity among rules and rules.  By looking at Figure 4, we may notice that the majority are the Helix motifs.  Because the statistical analysis of the structural database indicates the average length of Helices is ten [15] and the window size we set in our previous work is nine, 70% of the sequence motifs generated by our FGK model are related to Helices.

B. Super-rules Presentation Figure 5 gives an example of level 1 super-rule 28, which  belongs to level 2 super-rule 5 (CE), and its components: motif #51, 59 and 239.  The motif presentation format is combined with amino acid logo [18]:  ? The upper box gives the motif ID number, the number of  members belonging to this motif, and the average secondary structural similarity.

? The graph demonstrates the type of amino acid frequently appearing in the given position by amino acid logo.  It only shows the amino acid appearing with a frequency higher than 8%.  The height of symbols within the stack indicates the relative frequency of each amino or nucleic acid at that position.

? The x-axis label indicates the representative secondary structure and the structural similarity among all members to the position.  For example, H70 indicates the representative 2nd structure is Helix and 70% of the whole members? 2nd structure is Helix to this position.

The motifs #51, 59, and 239 not only all constructed in a Coil-Helix form, but also all start from two weak Coils and then turn into a higher secondary structural similarity to the next two Coils followed by strong five- position Helixes.  We may also tell from the Figure 5 that the super-rule is an adequate representation of these three motifs.

Since we summarized our 343 motifs into 69 level-1 Super-rules, we present some Super-rules in the appendix.

The motif presentation format is described below:   ? The upper box gives the level-1 Super-Rule ID number, the  number of members belonging to this motif, the average secondary structural similarity and the average HSSP- BLOSUM62 2.1 value.

? The graph demonstrates the type of amino acid frequently appearing in the given position by amino acid logo.  It only shows the amino acid appearing with a frequency higher than 8%.  The height of symbols within the stack indicates the relative frequency of each amino or nucleic acid at that position.

? The third row indicates the representative secondary structure and the structural similarity among all members to the position.

? The last row shows the representative HSSP-BLOSUM62 value to the position.

C. Super-rules Evaluation We evaluate our clustering results by calculating the HSSP-  BLOSUM62 measure on each super-rule.  We calculate the average HSSP-BLOSUM62 Gain on the level-1 super-rules that belong to the same level-2 super-rules.  Figure 6 is the demonstration of the results.

-0.5  -0.4  -0.3  -0.2  -0.1   0.1  0.2  0.3  0.4  Level2 Super- rule 0  Level2 Super- rule 1  Level2 Super- rule 2  Level2 Super- rule 3  Level2 Super- rule 4  Level2 Super- rule 5  Level2 Super- rule 6  Level2 Super- rule 7  Level2 Super- rule 8  Level2 Super- rule 9  Level2 Super- rule 10  Over All  H S  S P-  BL O  S U  M  G A  IN   Figure 6 The average HSSP-BLOSUM62 Gain on the level-1  super-rules that belong to the same level-2 super-rules.

By analyzing Figure 6, 5 out of 11 groups gain the HSSP- BLOSUM62 value.  On the other hand, 6 of those lose the value, especially the super-rules belongs to level-2 super-rule  6, 7, and 8.  The overall average HSSP-BLOSUM62 Gain equals -0.013.  Although the value is a negative value indicates we lose some bio-chemical significant, the value itself is very small.  Therefore, we may conclude that the super-rules are generated under the circumstance of not sacrificing secondary structure similarity and keeping almost the same HSSP-BLOSUM62 measure.



V. CONCLUSION In this paper, we propose some novel ideas: (1) We  modified Hybrid Hierarchical K-means (HHK) clustering algorithm into a parameter-free approach to reduce the human inference on the clustering results.  (2) Super-Rule-Tree (SRT) is a higher level of super rule concept; it can serve as a visualized graph analysis of the similarity of motifs.  (3) A novel measure named ?HSSP-BLOSUM62 GAIN? is proposed to evaluate the clustering results.  It is the first time that HHK clustering algorithm is applied to generate super- rules and SRT.  The fully automatically generated SRT gives a clear big picture of relations between protein sequence motifs and motifs.  Although the works described in this paper are merely based on protein primary structure computation, the results are also meaningful to protein secondary structure as well as the biochemical point of view.

One of most important future work is solve another problem, similar motifs with shifted spaces, caused by fixed window size approach.  Association rules with distance specification might be handy.  For example, the information we obtain contains not only ?If motif A appears in a protein sequence, then motif B also appears? but also considers ?the information of the distance between motif A and B in the sequence.?  The only problem is that if many motifs those are similar to each other, we may obtain lots of meaningless information such as ?If motif A appears in a protein sequence, then motif B also appears with distance zero.?  We may avoid this situation by feeding super-rules instead of original motif.

Since fixed window size approach may cause two problems simultaneously, a systematic strategy which combines both SRT and ?distance? association rules is very reasonable.  We believe many further researches can be derived from this work.
