A Data Mining Method to Predict Transcriptional Regulatory Sites   Based on Differentially Expressed Genes in Human Genome

Abstract  Very large-scale gene expression analysis, i.e., UniGene and dbEST, are provided to find those genes with significantly differential expression in specific tissues. The differentially expressed genes in a specific tissue are potentially regulated concurrently by a combination of transcription factors. This study attempts to mine putative binding sites on how combinations of the known regulatory sites homologs and over-represented repetitive elements are distributed in the promoter regions of considered groups of differentially expressed genes. We propose a data mining approach to statistically discover the significantly tissue-specific combinations of known site homologs and over-represented repetitive sequences, which are distributed in the promoter regions of differentially gene groups. The association rules mined would facilitate to predict putative regulatory elements and identify genes potentially co-regulated by the putative regulatory elements.

1.Introduction   Very large-scale gene expression analysis, i.e., UniGene and dbEST, are provided to find those genes with significantly differential expression in specific tissues.

Single-pass partially sequencing of cDNA clones from diverse tissues are deposited in the form of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) in dbEST [1-3]. The sequences in GenBank including ESTs are partitioned into a non-redundant set of gene-oriented clusters and are stored in UniGene database. Each of UniGene clusters means as a unique gene with numerous sequences from different EST libraries, which contain information such as the tissue types, organism protein similarities modeling, and the LocusLink identifier. It has also been used for gene  mapping and large-scale expression analysis now.

Bortoluzzi et al. proposed a computational approach to  large-scale analysis of gene expression in several human adult tissues [4]. The basic assumption of the method [4] is that the level of activity and the tissue expression pattern of a given gene may be inferred from the number of corresponding ESTs obtained from unbiased cDNA libraries from the considered tissues. A computational and statistical study on large set of gene expression data pertaining six adult human tissues, i.e. Uterus, Ovary, Brain, Liver, Skeletal muscle, Retina, was performed for analyzing the expression of ribosomal protein genes [4].

While Bortoluzzi et al. considered only the ribosomal protein genes for which expression levels resulted statistically different according to both R statistics [4] and AC [5] test, we attempt to select all genes that are differentially expressed in the same considered tissues for further analysis and discover the associations of known site homologs and oligonucleotides to predict potentially regulatory sites.

Many experimental identifying TF binding sites have been collected in TRANSFAC [6], which is the most complete and well maintained database on transcription factors, their genomic binding sites and DNA-binding profiles [6]. Our approach takes the known TF site homologs in the considered gene promoter region into account to correlate to the over-represented repetitive oligonucleotides located in upstreams of considered differentially expressed gene group.

Br zma et al. [8] developed a general software tool to find and analyze combinations of TF binding sites that occur often in gene upstream regions in the yeast genome.

Horng et al. [9-10] also proposed a data mining approach, association rules, to investigate the combinations of known site homologs and over-represented repeats in yeast genome and some significant oligonucleotides are predicted as putative sites based on the their significant  Proceedings of the Third IEEE Symposium on BioInformatics and BioEngineering (BIBE?03)    correlation to known sites homologs.

Moreover, we are interested in the potentially  co-regulated genes, which are the differentially expressed genes in specific tissues discovered by computational and statistical approaches. This study attempts to find differentially expressed genes by statistically analyzing EST libraries from six adult human tissues, i.e. Uterus, Ovary, Brain, Liver, Skeletal muscle, and Retina. The differentially expressed genes in a specific tissue are potential to be regulated concurrently by combinations of transcription factors. Upon this idea, we apply the data mining approach proposed in [[6]] to mine putative binding sites on how combinations of the known regulatory site homologs and over-represented repetitive oligonucleotides are distributed in the promoter regions of considered differentially expressed gene groups. Some interesting associations of known site homologs and over-represented repetitive oligonucleotides are found in the tissue of Ovary, Skeletal muscle, and Liver.

2.Methods   The approach initially observed the genes with highly and differentially expression in the same tissues, while they are not in other tissues [4] by calculating the R statistic and PAC values from gene expression data partitioned into different tissue categories. Moreover, we computationally identify the combinations of known transcription factor (TF) site of Homo sapiens from TRANSFAC [6] and repetitive sequences from RSDB [11] located in the promoter regions of groups of genes while are highly and differentially expressed in a specific tissue.

Then, a data mining approach is applied to mine the association rules in the combinations of the known site homologs and over-represented repetitive oligonucleotides.

Chi-square test is then applied to select certain significant rules. Finally, the over-represented repetitive oligonucleotides in the association rules are candidates of putative regulatory elements [9-10].

2.1 Materials  The sequences of promoter regions, i.e., upstream regions from 0 bps to ?2000 bps (which the 0 bps is position of the transcription start site), are extracted directly from the draft sequences of target genome, i.e., homo sapiens, and the gene annotations are obtained from GenBank (September 06, 2001). The differential gene expression analysis involved six human tissues i.e., Uterus, Ovary, Brain, Liver, Skeletal muscle and Retina for which a sufficient number of ESTs, obtained from unbiased cDNA libraries, was available in UniGene database (build #147). The amounts of cDNA libraries, UniGene clusters and EST sequences retrieved for each tissue are shown in Table 1.

17976 human annotated genes with gene symbol are stored in GenBank, as well as 96105 clusters in UniGene database. 15060 genes of GenBank are selected because of occurring exact once in the draft sequences of human genome. Also, 15198 annotated UniGene clusters are selected. By cross-referenced the gene symbol of these genes selected from GenBank and UniGene, 12060 are found with the same gene symbol.

TRANSFAC database [6] (professional 5.4) contains 11,537 site sequences in total, while the number of binding sites of Homo sapiens is 1,269. Most of these known sites used in this study are consensus patterns. The data in TRANSFAC has the following features. A transcription factor binding site accession number may have different consensus sequences.

The repetitive sequences of the human genome are generated from the merging draft sequences of human genome from GenBank and stored in the repetitive sequence database (RSDB) [11], where the whole human genome sequences are merging of nucleotide contigs without assembling them for the reason of only considering the site occurrence in whole human genome.

2.2 Differential Gene Expression   We select six adult human tissues, i.e., Brain, Liver, Skeletal muscle, Ovary, Retina and Uterus, which are also been analyzed in [4], to perform a computational and statistical analysis. The aim of this step is to find the genes with differential expression by computing their the R value [4] and PAC value [5] based on the amounts of EST sequences corresponding in each considered tissues. Each of the 12,060 UniGene clusters are analyzed to be  Proceedings of the Third IEEE Symposium on BioInformatics and BioEngineering (BIBE?03)    differential expressed in any one of the six tissues when the calculated R value is greater than 35.61 (the value is associated to a probability value smaller than 0.0001) and PAC value is smaller than 0.0001. Genes showing (are expressed) in a given tissue a level of expression significantly higher than in all the other tissues were considered as ?differentially expressed?. All of genes significantly more expressed in a specific tissue than in others are identified and then be grouped by the differentially expressed tissues.

2.3 Preprocessing and Mapping   The TF binding sites categorized in Homo sapiens from TRANSFAC [6] and repetitive oligonucleodtides in RSDB [11] are first prepared. For each group of considered differentially expressed genes in a specific tissue, all the human known regulatory sites are directly located homologously into the gene promoter regions from 0 to ?2000 bps (before the transcriptional start site), as well as the repetitive oligonucleotides are located. The occurrences of each known site homologs and over-represented repetitive oligonucleotides are calculated and then provided to the following statistical analysis.

2.4 Over-represented Repetitive Oligomers   The over-represented repetitive oligonucleotides of homo sapiens are found by applying two statistical methods, one is proposed in [12] and the other is described as follows. The repetitive oligonucleotides, which are with significant values sig exceeding the threshold, which is set to 0, are selected as significant over-represented one in the genes of differentially expressed genes in a specific tissue.

The sites with the lowest probability are the most over-represented oligomers. The advantage of the significance value is that its threshold can be selected and its values interpreted independently of oligonucleotide size, upstream sequence size, and number of genes within the family.

2.5 Mining Sites Associations and Pruning   We apply the data mining approach proposed in [9-10] to mine putative binding sites on how combinations of the known regulatory site homologs and over-represented repetitive oligonucleotides are distributed in the promoter regions of considered differentially expressed gene groups.

Some interesting associations of known site homologs and over-represented repetitive oligonucleotides are found in the tissue of Ovary, Skeletal muscle, and Liver.

2.6 Tissue-specific Combinations   After the discovery of significant occurrence associations of known site homologs and over-represented repetitive oligonucleotides, we propose here a D-value statistic to determine the association which is preferable to some specific tissues, i.e., the association is more frequently found in the specific tissues. In order to investigate the occurrence differences of the site association mined from different tissues, we propose a D-value statistic to compute the hypothesis that each occurrence frequency is consistent with the others.

Computing D-value can extract the combinations whose the occurrence most varied across different tissues. The statistic is denoted as Dj for combination j in given formula 1, where m is the number of tissues, xi,j is the amount of genes contains the combination j in the tissue i, and Ni is the total number of considered genes in the tissue i. The frequency fj of the combination j in the tissue i over all tissues is given by formula 2.

( ) =  = m  i fN  X  ji ji  jiXDj  , ,log      (1)    =  == m  i  i  m  i  ji  j  N  x f    , (2)   For instance, the number of the considered genes  (differentially expressed) in the tissues of Ovary, Liver and Skeletal muscle are 10, 21 and 35, respectively. The site combination, ?tataca, ttgaaa?, can be located into 2, 3 and 19 gene promoter regions of Ovary, Liver, and Skeletal muscle, respectively. By applying formula 7, the D-value in this example is calculated to be 8.23. The greater D-value is computed from different tissues, the more tissue-specific the combination among the select tissues is:    3.0  1932 ? ++  ++=jf     23.8 3.0*35  ln19  3.0*21  ln3  3.0*10  ln2 =?+?+?=jD           Proceedings of the Third IEEE Symposium on BioInformatics and BioEngineering (BIBE?03)     Table 2.

For example, Hs.77039 is  Proceedings of the Third IEEE Symposium on BioInformatics and BioEngineering (BIBE?03)    higher expression in Uterus than the other tissues, as well as ten genes are higher expression in Ovary; three genes are higher expression in Brain; 21 genes are higher expression in Liver; thirty-five genes are higher expression in Skeletal muscle; and four genes are higher expression in Retina. In this study we adopt ten genes in Ovary, twenty-one genes in Liver and thirty-five genes in Skeletal muscle for further analyses and the potential co-regulated genes are used for the prediction of regulatory elements.

The genome sequences and gene information are obtained from NCBI. We use R statistic and PAC value to analyze genes expression in six adult human tissues. Since the numbers of differential expressed genes are found less then 6 (specified threshold) in the tissues of Uterus, Brain, and Retina, the three tissues are not analyzed further for prediction of regulatory sites. We just focus on Ovary, Liver and Skeletal muscle. Table 3 shows the numbers of known TF binding sites and over-represented repetitive elements in promoter regions that are related to genes with differential expression in the specific tissue categories, i.e., Ovary, Skeletal muscle or Liver. The minimum support is set to 60% and confidence is set to 80%, e.g., each of found association is contained in six of ten considered genes. The ?Average? and ?Maximum? indicate the average and maximum numbers of known sites or over-represented repeats in the promoter regions, respectively. For example, 5,573 associations are discovered in 10 promoter regions in the tissue type of Ovary, where 158 known TF binding sites or over-represented repeats in average are located in the promoter region and the maximum number is up to 59.

Finally, 69 significant associations are left after applying Chi-square test.

Several interesting and significant associations in tissues ?Ovary?, ?Liver? and ?Skeletal muscle? are shown in Table 4. The first column in Table 4 is the tissue type and the second one is the associations contained known TF binding sites in uppercase alphabet and over-represented repetitive oligomers in lowercase alphabet; the third one is the confidence of the association; the fourth one is the support value; the fifth one is the Chi-square value; the last one is similar to the second one except the use of transcription factor names in TRANSFAC [[6]]. For instance, the association of ?acaggc, CATTT, GGTTA => agctga? is discovered in the tissue of Ovary, where the support value is 0.70, confidence value is 1.0, and ? 2 value is 6.85. ?CATTT? and ?GGTTA? are known sites with TRANSFAC symbol of ?YY1? and ?WT1?, respectively, and ?acaggc? and ?agctga? are a significant over-represented repetitive oligonucleotide. Similarly, ?TATAAT => ctcagc? is a site association found in the tissue of Liver with support value, confident value, and ? 2 value of 0.67, 0.94, and 5.21, respectively; ?CACCC, TGGCA => agctgg? is a site association found in the tissue of Skeletal muscle with support value, confidence value,  and ? 2 value of 0.65, 0.88, and 4.33, respectively.

The repetitive oligonucleotides associated to the known  TF binding site are selected as putative regulatory sites because of their occurrence correlation to known signal of transcriptional regulation in a group of considered genes, i.e., these genes are differentially expressed in a specific tissue. As shown in Table 5, Ms, match sequences, the number of gene upstreams which contain at least one pattern occurrence of the site; Occ, number of occurrences of the pattern among all upstream regions from genes which are higher expression in specific tissue; Exp, expected number of occurrences; sig, significant coefficient calculated as defined in [12]; Z-score, calculated as defined. For example, the sequence ?AAGAGG? is located into 10 gene upstreams from 10 genes totally in the gene set of tissue Ovary. Twenty-six occurrences are found, while the expected occurrence us 8.06 in the 10 gene upstreams of length 2,000 bps. The sig value of ?AAGAGG? in the Liver is 3.08 and Z-score is 6.32; ?AGAGGC? are 4.60 and 7.59; ?GGAGGA? are 8.52 and 7.01; ?CGGAGG? are 4.75 and 6.98, respectively.

The four over-represented repetitive oligonucleotides are extracted from the significant associations discovered in the tissue ?Ovary?. The consensus sequence ?MRGAGGM? is generated by aligning these four sequences together. There are 37 consensus sequences in Ovary, 52 consensus sequences in Liver and 48 consensus sequences in Skeletal muscle.

We further compute the D-value for each combination mined in each group of genes with higher expression in one tissue than the others to observe the dependence of a combination of regulatory sites in different tissues. As shown in Table 6, we select three tissues as example, i.e., the three tissues are ?Ovary?, ?Liver? and ?Skeletal muscle?, to show the differential combinations (D-value exceeds 2.0, at least one support value greater than 0.4) of regulatory sites. The number of genes in each tissues are shown in the third row. For example, in the fifth row the combination of ?ggagcc, tgagca? occur in the gene upstreams of tissues, Ovary, Liver and Skeletal muscle, with Chi-square values 10.0, 1.64 and 0.44, respectively.

The Chi-square value greater than 3.84 is shown with parentheses. Similarly, the support values are 0.5, 0 and 0.17. The support value greater than 0.4 is shown with parentheses. The D-value is shown in the last column and the D-value of the combination ?ggagcc, tgagca? is 3.47.

Six combinations of ?ggagcc, tgagca?, ?ggagaa, ggcaac?, ?cttggc, gaggcc?, ?GGTTA, gaggaa?, ?CTGTC, ccagtc? and ?ATTGG, gctgga? are differential in tissue of ?Ovary? by considering the D-value of the six combinations greater then threshold 2.0. All the support values of them are also greater than 0.4, while in other categories the support values are very less than 0.4. Similarly, some combinations are also differential in other tissues.

Each gene promoter region is mapped to a ?transaction? and known regulatory site homologs and over-represented repetitive oligonucleotides are mapped to items of a transaction. The data mining techniques are then applied to mine the associations. The enormous number of associations makes it extremely difficult to identify those interesting and useful ones. The redundant rules are pruned and putative regulatory elements are obtained from the rest of the  associations. Tissue-specific combinations of regulatory sites can be discovered statistically among the study tissues and the significant value of the site combinations are also provided.

Moreover, the proposed approach also can be potentially applied to other considered tissue sets, which can be different histologies, i.e., normal or cancer tissues.

The approach can discover tissue-specific combinations of known TF binding sites and over-represented repetitive oligonucleotides between normal and cancer tissues to potentially investigate the differential gene regulation in transcription level. The thresholds of the approach like R-value, p-value, and D-value can also be adjusted when analyzing and studying in different set of tissues.

It notes that the occurrences of repetitive sequences and known TF binding sites reveals the repetitive elements to be putative regulatory elements because groups of  Proceedings of the Third IEEE Symposium on BioInformatics and BioEngineering (BIBE?03)    transcription factors usually occur cooperatively. By considering the occurrence associations of known sites and repetitive sequences, the repetitive sequences can be viewed as putative regulatory signals correlated to the known TF binding sites. However, we find several associations that do not have any known TF binding sites.

The meanings and functionalities of these signals are interesting and necessary to be verified by biologists.
