Command & Data Handling for the Magnetospheric  Multiscale Mission

Abstract - The Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission is the fourth mission of the Solar Terrestrial Probes (STP)  program of the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration (NASA). The MMS mission, consisting of four  identically instrumented spacecraft, will use Earth's  magnetosphere as a laboratory to study magnetic reconnection,  a fundamental plasma-physical process that taps the energy  stored in a magnetic field and converts it - typically explosively  - into heat and kinetic energy in the form of charged particle  acceleration and large-scale flows of matter.

The Command & Data Handling (C&DH) subsystem is  responsible for the spacecraft command and telemetry, time  management and distribution, analog data acquisition and also  hosts the flight software. Other mission specific functions  include interfacing to the Instrument Suite (IS) through the  Central Instrument Data Processor (CIDP) and other  hardware components such as the S-Band Transponder, the  Accelerometer, the Digital Sun Sensor (DSS), and the Star  Sensor. The C&DH subsystem consists of one box with two of  each card (Backplane, Low Voltage and Power Services  (LVPS) Card, Communication Card, Processor Card and  Analog Card). One side is designated as Side A or the primary  side and the other as Side B or the redundant side. Only one  side (primary side) is active (fully powered on) at a given time.

However, the other side (redundant side) has a warm front end  where the interface to the Radio Frequency (RF)  Communication subsystem (Communication Card) is on for  command decoding and is also capable of downlinking data.

The computing part of the redundant side is powered off.

One of the technical novelties on this mission is the use of  SpaceWire (SpW) as the primary spacecraft bus. The SpW  network provides communication paths for commands and  telemetry, including science data, between: ? The primary and redundant C&DH and the primary  and redundant CIDP units ? Each C&DH and its Navigator (NA V) ? Each C&DH and its Power Subsystem Electronics  (PSE) ? Each C&DH and its Engine Valve Driver (EVD) ? The Processor Card, Communication Card and  Analog Card modules within each C&DH  The network is a cold spare, redundant configuration with the  exception that both Communication Cards are always  powered. Also, the NA V, PSE, Processor Card, Analog Card  and EVD are block redundant. Two SpW Routers reside on  the C&DH, one on the Processor Card and the other on the  Communication Card. A SpW node core resides on the Analog  Card. They are both compatible with the European  Cooperation for Space Standardization (ECSS) Space  Engineering SpaceWire - Links, Nodes, Routers and Networks  (ECSS-E-50-12A) standard in addition to the Router   Damaris L.

The interfaces to the Attitude Control System (ACS)  components (Accelerometer, DSS, Star Sensor) as well as the  S-Band Transponder are primarily RS-422 with the exception  of the DSS which is a single-ended interface. The ACS FSW  (hosted by the Processor Card) receives Accelerometer, Star  Sensor, and EVD data at 4 Hertz (Hz), and DSS data once per  spacecraft revolution. The ACS FSW generates thruster firing  commands which are sent over SpW to the EVD hardware.

This paper will provide a detailed description into the  implementation of the command and data handling functions  from uplink command and data processing to data downlink.

The hardware design will be highlighted in order to show how  (1) requirements are met and (2) the burden on flight software  is lessened.
