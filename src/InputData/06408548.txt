Abstract?Under the current secondary school education system a significant number of talented students fail the General Certificate of Education Advanced Level (G.C.E. A?level) examination, especially in the Physical Science stream.  The surprising fact is that a majority of them have performed highest level at the General Certificate of Education Ordinary Level (G.C.E. O?level) examination.  At the same time, students who have not performed at the highest level at the G.C.E. O?level examination, have performed well at the A?level examination under some other subject streams. Therefore the stream selected for the G.C.E. A?level is a critical factor that determines a student?s future. The failure rate for those in the Physical Science stream is the highest amongst the four streams, and at present there is no mechanism available to address this issue. Thus this study focuses on analyzing the factors that contribute to the high failure rate of the Physical Science stream students at the G.C.E.

A?level examination using data mining techniques. In addition, a method of identifying the students, suitable to follow the Physical Science stream is presented. This is done by comparing the A?level results with the corresponding O?level results. The analysis reveals the direct impact of a student?s performance in Science and Mathematics at the O?level examination on his performance at the A?level examination. The analysis also highlights the fact that a student must obtain the highest grade for both Mathematics and Science in order to succeed at the G.C.E. A?level. It also reveals that a student who wishes to study in the Physical Science stream must also perform well in Religion, Social Studies, First Language and the Technical subject at O?level examination. The impact of the results of O?level subjects to the A?level result under Physical Science has also been prioritized.

I. INTRODUCTION The secondary education system in Sri Lanka consists of  two main examinations, the General Certificate of Education Ordinary Level (G.C.E. O?level) and the General Certificate of Education Advanced Level (G.C.E. A?level); which are conducted by the Department of Examination in Sri Lanka.

After studying for 11 years in schools, pupils sit for the G.C.E.

O?level examination to qualify for collegiate level (also called senior secondary level) education which lasts another two years.  Thereafter they sit the competitive university entrance examination, the G.C.E. A?level examination [1], [2].  Based  on the results obtained at this examination, a limited number of students are selected to the state universities which are non-fee levying.  This may be the cause for the highly competitive nature of this examination.

The G.C.E. A?level examination is conducted under four main subject streams, namely Physical Science, Biological Science, Commerce and Arts.  Under each stream, students have to face three papers relevant to the stream.  Apart from this, everybody has to sit the General English paper and the Common General Knowledge paper.  A certain competency has to be attained in these two papers to qualify for university entrance.  However, selection to the university is based on the marks scored at the A?level examination for the three subjects relevant to the stream.

In the current context, a significant number of talented students fail the A?level examination [3]. There are students from rural areas who have recorded the best results at G.C.E.

O?level in their respective schools but have been unsuccessful at the A?level examination in the Biological Science and Physical Science streams.  At the same time, students who have not performed at the highest level at the G.C.E. O?level, but have selected either Commerce or Arts for the G.C.E. A?level have performed well at the A?level examination. The failure rate at the A?level examination is high among urban school children too who have selected either Biological Science or Physical Science, in comparison to Commerce and Arts [4].

Thus the stream selected seems to be a critical factor affecting the performance at the G.C.E. A?level examination.

The minimum criterion for selection to the G.C.E. A?level Physical Science stream is six passes at the G.C.E. O?level including three credit passes, one of which should be for Mathematics and a simple pass for Science. A study of the past results clearly indicates that satisfying this minimum criterion is insufficient to ensure even three simple passes at the G.C.E.

A?level examination. A significant number of students who performed much better than the minimum criterion required to enter the Physical Science stream, also perform poorly in this stream at the A?level examination. These results reveal the urgent need for a proper mechanism to select the most appropriate stream to follow at the G.C.E. A?level, mainly to reduce the failure rate. This has been the motivating factor       behind this research. Data mining is defined as ?use of sophisticated data analysis tools to discover previously unknown, valid patterns and relationships in large data sets? [5]. It seems to be a suitable mechanism which can be used to resolve this issue. Different data mining techniques have been applied by researchers to solve different issues in the area of education [6], [7]. In this issue Association Rule technique of data mining  is used to identify certain patterns in the examination results [8], [9], [10].



II. PROBLEM DEFINITION In Sri Lanka, there are almost two hundred thousand  students sit for the G.C.E. A?level examination annually, but a significant number among them do not pass the examination.

[3]. The pattern of being successful at the G.C.E. A?level examination for all subject streams (from 1993 to 2009) is shown in Figure 1. Here it?s clear that not even 50 percent of the students pass the G.C.E. A?level examination annually. In comparison to the other streams, a majority of students from the Biological Science and the Physical Science streams have been unsuccessful in obtaining even three simple passes. When considering O?level examination results, those who have opted for the Commerce or Arts streams have performed better than those who have selected either Biological Science or Physical Science stream.

A comparison of the failure rates for different A?level subjects is shown in Figure 2. This provides evidence of relatively high failure rates for subjects in the Physical Science stream (Combined Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry) and the Biological Science stream (Biology, Physics and Chemistry) , along with a  few other subjects such as Accounting, Economics and Political Science from other streams. Combined Mathematics has the highest failure rate in both 2009 and 2010, followed by Chemistry and Physics.

Furthermore, if one considers the subject combination Combined Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry, it reveals a higher failure rate than the subject combination Biology, Physics and Chemistry.  It should be noted that this graph only depicts few subjects with high failure rates, out of the total number of subjects offered at the G.C.E. A?level examination in four streams.

III. ANALYSIS The main focus of this analysis was to find combinations of  G.C.E. O?level subjects that have an effect on the G.C.E.

A?level examination results of students in the Physical Science stream. To achieve this, some association rules were generated with a support value between 15 percent and 100 percent and a minimum lift value of 1.1 [11]. Figure 3 shows the set of association rules generated under above conditions using the 2007 G.C.E. A?level Physical Science stream results of students.

Each association rule has a separate confidence value, lift value and number of occurrences [11].  For instance, let?s consider the following association rule,  FirstLang = A Science = A Maths =A  Technical = A 2364 ALResult = P 1796  From the Physical Science stream students (9758) who sat the G.C.E. A?level examination in 2007 there were 2364 students who had obtained A passes for First Language, Science, Mathematics and Technical subject at the G.C.E.

O?level examination. Among them, only 1796 passed the G.C.E. A?level examination. Therefore the confidence level is 0.76 (1796/2364) and the lift value is 0.29. The support value for this rule is 1796/9758 which equals to 0.184.

Here the best rule has been selected mainly based on the lift value, as higher the lift value, higher would be the dependency of the association rule. Hence the following has been selected as the best association rule that can be found based on the set of rules in Figure 3, with a lift value of 2.19;  Religion = A FirstLang = A Science = A  Maths = A Social = A Technical = A ALResult = P  According to this rule, 80 percent of the students who had ?A? passes for Religion, First Language, Science, Mathematics, Social Studies and the Technical subject have passed the G.C.E. A?level examination.  When considering the numbers, 1501 students out of 1881 with the above results have passed the A?level examination with a support of 1501/9758 = 0.1538.

Figure 3. Top ten association rules generated (proportionate to their lift value) using the 2007 G.C.E. A?level examination results of students in the Physical Science stream, with the consequent as the examination results.

Basically when the support value is considered, there are some other association rules with higher support, even though their confidence and lift values are lower than the above selected rule.  Since the support value is 15 percent, one may argue that this percent is small.  However this is out of the total number of students who sat the G.C.E. A?level examination under Physical Science stream. When taking the proportion out of those who have passed the examination, it is 42 percent (1501/3548) which is considerably high.  Thus it can be concluded that these subjects have a significant impact on overall G.C.E. A?level result of a student and if one has A passes for all these O?level subjects, then he/she has a higher probability of passing the A?level examination.

When considering the impact of individual subjects of the above combination, some subjects seem to be having different influence on passing the G.C.E. A?level examination.  The pre- requisite for a student to follow Physical Science stream at the G.C.E. A?level is as mentioned previously, six passes at the G.C.E. O?level examination with three credit passes, one of which is for Mathematics, and a simple pass for Science. Hence it was decided to identify the impact of these G.C.E. O?level subjects in isolation. The initial focus obviously was on two subjects, Mathematics and Science.

A. Impact of G.C.E. O?level Mathematics result on the G.C.E. A?level result.

Maths = C 921 AL = F 896   conf:(0.97) Maths = B 1837 AL = F 1690   conf:(0.92) Maths = A 7000 AL = F 3624   conf:(0.52)  As per the above association rules obtained for the 2007 G.C.E. A?level results, a student who has obtained a C pass for Mathematics at G.C.E. O?level will fail the G.C.E. A?level examination with a confidence level of 0.97. Further, those who have obtained a B pass for Mathematics will also fail the A?level examination with the same level of confidence.

However, there is a 3 percent probability of a student with only a C pass for O?level Mathematics, passing the G.C.E. A?level examination.  This is quite rare.  Further, more than 50 percent of the students with an A pass for Mathematics at the G.C.E.

O?level has failed the A?level examination.

Figure 4 shows the impact of G.C.E. O?level Mathematics result on the G.C.E. A?level result under Physical Science stream. This shows the overall percent (support) of students who have passed and failed the G.C.E. A?level examination against the results obtained for O?level Mathematics.  This depicts that of those who obtained an A grade for Mathematics at the G.C.E. O?level examination, approximately half have failed the A?level examination, which is significant.  This reveals the importance of further study along these lines. Hence this study focused on identifying the impact of the results of some other O?level subjects on the G.C.E. A?level result of a student.

B. Impact of G.C.E. O?level Science result on the G.C.E.

A?level result.

As for Mathematics, it was decided to study whether the O?level Science result of a student had a significant impact on his/her G.C.E. A?level examination result. Science was considered after Mathematics since a student?s O?level Science result seems to be a critical factor that influences a student?s willingness to follow the Physical Science stream at the A?level.

Figure 4. The impact of O?level Mathematics result on the A?level result.

Association rules generated related to the impact of Science at the G.C.E. O?level are;  Science = S 500 AL = F 486   conf:(0.97) Science = C 2316 AL = F 2101   conf:(0.91) Science = B 2757 AL = F 2057   conf:(0.75)  Science = A 4182 AL = F 1563   conf:(0.37)  As per above association rules, a student with a credit pass or a simple pass for Science at G.C.E. O?level examination has failed the G.C.E. A?level examination with a probability of 91 percent and 97 percent respectively.  Even with a B pass for Science at G.C.E. O?level, the probability of failing the G.C.E.

A?level examination is 75 percent. Moreover, the probability of a student who has obtained an A grade for Science at the G.C.E. O?level examination failing the G.C.E. A?level examination is still high, though less than 50 percent. Hence, obtaining an A grade for Science at G.C.E. O?level examination does not ensure success at the A?level examination, as the rate of failure is still one third.

The impact of the G.C.E. O?level Science result on the G.C.E. A?level result under the Physical Science stream is shown in Figure 5. The figure shows the overall percent (support) of students who have passed and failed the G.C.E.

A?level examination against the results obtained for O?level Science.

Only an extraordinary student would pass the G.C.E.

A?level examination in Physical Science stream after obtaining only a C or a S pass for Science at G.C.E. O?level examination.

Further, the probability of being unsuccessful at the G.C.E.

A?level in Physcial Science stream  is close to three fourth even for a student with a B pass for Science. Hence in general, if a student?s performance in Science at the G.C.E. O?level is poor, there is a very high probability of become unsuccessful at the G.C.E. A?level in the Physical Science stream. Conversely, if a student performs at the highest level in Science at the G.C.E.

O?level examination, the probability is fairly low to failing the G.C.E. A?level in the Physical Science stream.  However, this probability too is considerably higher than the anticipated.

Thus by considering all the above facts, it can be concluded that even obtaining A grades for Mathematics and Science at G.C.E. O?level examination does not guarantee success at the  Figure 5. The impact of O?level Science result on the A?level result.

G.C.E. A?level examination in Physical Science stream.

Moreover, a clear relationship between O?level Mathematics result and Science result taken in isolation with the A?level result in Physical Science stream could not be observed.  Hence the study was extended to identify any relationship between both the G.C.E.O?level Mathematics and Science results with the G.C.E. A?level result in Physical Science stream.

C. Combined impact of G.C.E. O?level Science and Mathematics results on the G.C.E. A?level result Students? failure rate at the G.C.E. A?level examination in  Physical Science stream was approximately 90 percent in year 2007 for those who had obtained either a B or C pass for G.C.E. O?level Mathematics.  Thus it was initially decided to focus on the group of students who had obtained an A pass for G.C.E. O?level Mathematics.  Then the confidence and support values for being unsuccessful at the G.C.E. A?level examination were analyzed, when the G.C.E. O?level Science result varied. Association rules satisfying the above conditions were selected.  The respective rules generated are as follows:  Sci=S Math=A 113 AL=F 106 conf(0.94) Sci=C Math=A 1079 AL=F 905 conf(0.84) Sci=B Math=A 1950 AL=F 1315 conf(0.67) Sci=A Math=A 3858 AL=F 1298 conf(0.34)  Approximately 90 percent of the students with a simple pass (S) for O?level Science have failed the G.C.E. A?level examination in Physical Science stream. It should be noted that these students have A passes for O?level Mathematics. The result is similar for those who obtained a C pass for Science too as approximately 80 percent failed the examination. More than 60 percent of those who obtained a B pass for Science and an A pass for Mathematics at G.C.E. O?level also failed the G.C.E.

A?level examination.  The percentage of failures declined to thirties among those who had obtained A passes in both Mathematics and Science.

The impact of the G.C.E. O?level Science and Mathematics result on the G.C.E. A?level result is shown in Figure 6. There, the horizontal axis depicts the G.C.E. O?level Science result obtained by students, whereas the vertical axis depicts the G.C.E. O?level Mathematics result obtained.  The red spots represent the students who have failed the G.C.E. A?level examination while the blue spots represent those who have passed the examination in 2007 in Physical Science stream.  A majority of the blue spots are scattered at the bottom left hand corner, while only a few are scattered elsewhere on the graph.

Figure 6 is a clear depiction of the impact of both the G.C.E. O?level Science and Mathematics results on the G.C.E.

A?level result. As shown in the figure, obtaining a very good pass in Mathematics alone is insufficient to guarantee success at the G.C.E. A?level examination in the Physical Science stream. It provides evidence that the probability of failing the G.C.E. A?level examination reduces as the G.C.E. O?level Science result improves, provided the student has a very good pass for G.C.E. O?level Mathematics. This is further confirmed by the fact shown in Figure 4 that the probability of failing the G.C.E. A?level under Physical Science stream is 51 percent even with an A pass in Mathematics at the G.C.E. O?level. This is probably high due to the unawareness among stakeholders of     Figure 6. Impact of O?level Science and Mathematics result on the 2007 A?level result.

the relationship between the G.C.E. A?level results and the G.C.E. O?level Science results. Hence, by considering the above results, it can be said that the probability of a student passing the G.C.E. A?level in Physical Science stream is considerably high when he/she has obtained A grades for both Mathematics and Science at the G.C.E. O?level examination.

On the other hand though, there is no significant difference when comparing the above results if G.C.E. O?level Science marks are taken in isolation. A major reason for this could be the smaller percentage of students having a B or C pass in Mathematics at the G.C.E. O?level examination selecting the Physical Science stream. Therefore, no significant difference is possible when the G.C.E. O?level examination results for Mathematics and Science are taken together against the G.C.E.

O?level Science results taken in isolation.

D. The Impact of G.C.E. O?level Result for Religion, First Language, Social Studies and the Technical subject on the G.C.E. A?level Result Religion, First Language, Social Studies and the Technical  subject are the remaining subjects in the best association rule that was generated at the beginning of the study. The impact of these subjects will be discussed together. Figure 7, Figure 8, Figure 9 and Figure 10 show the impact of the results of each of the G.C.E. O?level subjects Religion, First Language, Social Studies and the Technical subject on the G.C.E. A?level results in 2007 under Physical Science stream.

All those who have obtained only an S pass for any one of the subjects Religion, First Language or Social Studies have been unsuccessful at the G.C.E. A?level examination. However a very few students who have obtained S passes for the Technical subject have been successful at the G.C.E A?level examination. The failure rates for all these four subjects are similar and not very significant which indicates the low impact of these subjects on a student?s G.C.E. A?level result. The most important feature that can be observed from the above bar  Figure 7. The impact of O?level Religion result on the A?level result.

Figure 8. The impact of  O?level First Language result on the A?level result.

Figure 9. The impact of O?level Social Studies result on the A?level result.

Figure 10. The impact of  O?level Technical subject result on the A?level result.

charts is that even when a student has performed at the highest level in each of these subjects, his/her failure rate at the G.C.E.

A?level in the Physical Science stream is not the lowest.

E. Prioritizing the Impact of G.C.E. O?level Subjects on the G.C.E. A?level Results The impact of the results of different G.C.E. O?level  subjects on the G.C.E. A?level results vary when considered individually. The impact of these subjects was measured by varying the result of one subject while keeping the results of the other subjects constant.  This effect has been analyzed in Figure 11.  It should be noted that the points have been connected by a line to demonstrate the decline of the pass rate clearly.

In this graph, the x-axis indicates the results that can be obtained for the G.C.E. O?level subjects and the y-axis indicates the confidence of passing the G.C.E. A?level examination.  Any point (related to A, B or C) on each line of the graph reveals the confidence value for the group of subjects with the indicated grade for the subject that line belongs to and A grades for rest of the subjects. For example, for the point corresponding to a B grade for Mathematics, it gives the confidence value for a student who obtains a B grade of Mathematics and an A grade for each of the other six subjects at the G.C.E. O?level. The following will provide a better depiction of the above.

Figure 11. Comparison of the impact of G.C.E. O?level subject results on 2007 G.C.E. A?level results in the Physical Science stream, when the results  of a single subject vary.

There are two points on the green line which have confidence values of approximately 0.8 for an A grade and 0.25 for a B grade. If one considers the first point, it illustrates the following association rule;  Mathematics = A, Religion = A, First Language = A, English = A, Science = A, Social Studies = A, Technical subject = A  A/L Result = Pass.

The second point illustrates the following association rule;  Mathematics = B, Religion = A, First Language = A, English = A, Science = A, Social Studies = A, Technical subject = A  A/L Result = Pass.

It is very clear that apart from the Mathematics results, all other results are constant in both situations. The confidence of passing the G.C.E. A?level examination has reduced from 0.8 to 0.25 due to the effect of the decline in the G.C.E. O?level Mathematics result from an A pass to a B pass.

Again, if one considers the light blue line which corresponds to the English language, the following association rules can be identified respectively for the three points.

English = A, Religion = A, First Language = A, Mathematics = A, Science = A, Social Studies = A, Technical subject = A  A/L Result = Pass  English = B, Religion = A, First Language = A, Mathematics = A, Science = A, Social Studies = A, Technical subject = A  A/L Result = Pass  English = C, Religion = A, First Language = A, Mathematics = A, Science = A, Social Studies = A, Technical subject = A  A/L Result = Pass  The confidence values in relation to the three association rules are 0.8, 0.78 and 0.67 respectively.

The above figure clearly depicts that more than 80 percent of the students who obtained very good passes in all six of the main subjects at the G.C.E. O?level  have performed well at the G.C.E. A?level. This fact is emphasized by the points corresponding to the A grade. Further, the points corresponding to the B grade represent the confidence value for passing the G.C.E. A?level examination with a B grade for the particular subject and A grades for the rest of the main subjects considered. A similar interpretation can be given to the points corresponding to the C grade where it expresses the confidence value for passing the G.C.E. A?level examination with a C grade for a particular subject and very good passes for the rest of the main subjects. Hence, by looking at the above figure, it can be clearly seen that a majority of the students who have obtained A passes for all the main subjects except English language, have passed the G.C.E. A?level in Physical Science stream.  This implies that the English language result at the G.C.E. O?level examination does not have a significant impact on the performance at the G.C.E. A?level examination under this stream.

The decline increases starting from the Technical subject, then Religion, Social Studies and First Language and finally Science and Mathematics; emphasizing the importance of good grades in Mathematics and Science at the G.C.E. O?level examination to become success at the G.C.E. A?level examination in Physical Science stream. The difference between the percentage that passes the G.C.E. A?level after obtaining an A grade in all seven O?level subjects and a B grade in Mathematics and A grades in the remaining six O?level subjects is quite high. This is however quite small with respect to the other six subjects. Yet, it should be noted that all these facts are true only for those who sat the 2007 G.C.E.

A?level examination in the Physical Science stream.

Figure 12 depicts the same information with respect to the 2010 G.C.E. A?level examination results in Physical Science stream. This figure clearly shows that approximately 80 percent of students who obtained A passes in all seven main subjects in G.C.E. O?level examination have passed the G.C.E. A?level examination, which is considerably high. However only 60 percent of those who obtained a B pass in Science and A passes in all other main subjects, were successful at the G.C.E. A?level examination held in 2010. When G.C.E O?level Mathematics is  Figure 12. Comparison of the impact of G.C.E. O?level subject results on 2010 G.C.E. A?level results in the Physical Science stream, when the results  of a single subject vary.

considered, this rate reduces to less than 50 percent. This decline is considerably low. Further, only 30 percent of those who had a C pass for O?level Science and A passes for the remaining six subjects were successful at the 2010 G.C.E.

A?level examination.  This rate is also considerably low. This highlights the importance of the G.C.E. O?level Science and Mathematics results for success at the G.C.E. A?level examination. When other subjects are considered, English language seems to be the least important subject as the decrement is very marginal.  The other four subjects too show marginal decrements which are not significant in comparison to Mathematics.  However the order has changed slightly from the 2007 results. In 2007, next to Mathematics and Science, Religion was the most important subject.  But in 2010, the importance of this subject has reduced slightly.

Despite the differences, these two graphs clearly indicate the importance of G.C.E. O?level Mathematics and Science to become success at the G.C.E. A?level.  They both pointed out the lack of importance of the English language. It should be noted here that these confidence values have been obtained using the association rules generated with a minimum support value. Therefore the impact of a C pass for some of the other subjects has not been considered as the accuracy of the confidence value for these subjects would be minimal due to the insufficient number of records.



IV. DISCUSSION This study has been conducted with the intention of  identifying any prevailing relationship between a student?s G.C.E. O?level result and his/her G.C.E. A?level result in Physical Science stream. Initially, the study focused on identifying whether the students selected to the Physical Science stream were those with the correct knowledge and capabilities. Thus the study was restricted to the students who did Physical Science at the G.C.E. A?level examination. The only method available was to compare the G.C.E. A?level results with the corresponding G.C.E. O?level results, to identify any existing patterns.

From the analysis carried out, it was observed that the G.C.E. O?level Science and Mathematics results of a student have a direct impact on his/her G.C.E. A?level result, for those in Physical Science stream. Further it was evident that a student had to perform at the highest level with regard to these two subjects in order to do well at the G.C.E. A?level examination.

In other words, better the performance in these two subjects, higher the probability of passing the G.C.E. A?level examination. This was clear from the computed confidence and support values too. Moreover, it was found out that there are a few other subjects that a student should focus on if he/she is planning on follow G.C.E. A?level in Physical Science stream, namely Religion, First Language, Social Studies and the Technical subject. This combination was identified with respect to the 2007 G.C.E. A?level results and corresponding G.C.E.

O?level results. From this study, the fact that G.C.E. O?level Mathematics and Science were the most important subjects behind the success at the G.C.E. A?level was highlighted.

Although the analysis revealed the above results, it was observed that some students with A grades in all subjects at the G.C.E. O?level examination have failed the G.C.E. A?level     examination. This may be due to some other factors which cannot be captured through an analysis which was purely based on examination results. There were also very rare students who had not obtained an A grade for any of the G.C.E. O?level papers, but were successful at the G.C.E. A?level examination.

These were extreme cases. There were also a quite a few students who have performed extremely well at the G.C.E.

A?level examination but those do not satisfy the above criterion.  However from the study it can be concluded that a student who fulfills the identified requirements has a higher chance of passing the G.C.E. A?level examination in Physical Science stream.



V. LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY A few limitations had to overcome during this study. A  major limitation was the lack of knowledge on other factors that influence the performance at the G.C.E. A?level examination. In this study the main focus was on identifying any relationship between G.C.E. O?level examination result and G.C.E. A?level examination result of students. However there could be other external factors that affect a student?s performance at the G.C.E. A?level examination.

It should be further pointed out that the standard of the O?level and A?level examinations can vary from year to year.

Hence one may argue that comparing the results of students who sat the examination in different years is not practical.



VI. SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER WORK Other factors that may have an effect on the G.C.E. A?level  results of students could be considered. Provided that data for some other factors are available, a logistic model could be fitted to identify the determinants of a student?s G.C.E. A?level results. A clearer understanding could also be obtained if results of a longer period were available for the analysis.
