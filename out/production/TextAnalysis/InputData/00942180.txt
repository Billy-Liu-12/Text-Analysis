0-7695-1022-1/01 S10.00 0 2001 IEEE  1. Introduction  Many kinds of web search engines, such as Yahoo! [23],  AltaVista[2], g00[20], fresheye[6], google[7] and so many others[21], have been developed. How- ever, as the volunie of data on the web is increasing rapidly, it is becoming difficult for naive users to  browse informative web pages. Especially, in the case of that users can't select the appropriate combination of key- words in the query, it is impossible to  discover valuable web resources.

For example, if one keyword have different meanings in different domains, it becomes very difficult to  select the suitable combination of keywords. In this case, we have t o  carefully choose the combination of keywords in the query. In order to resolve these problems, many advanced techniques have been implemented for the support of web information retrieval.

In order to  help the procedures of web resource discovery, we also try to  implement several emerging technologies, such as data mining[9, 191 and java ap- plets, though our developed Mondou search engine is one of first generation of search engines[l4]. In this paper, we describe the concept of Mondou system in the view points of web/text mining[5] and information visualization[3] .

In Section 2 ,  we describethe total architecture of the Mondou search engine, which supports the procedures of web information retrieval. Our proposed framework can also support the discovery process for intranet re- sources, e-mails, electric news and other kinds of com- mercial databases. In Section 3, we introduce the al- gorithm of weighted association rule, which is imple-  'Discovery1 is in the processes of questions and answers, the name of Mondou comes from one of sophisticated discus- sion styles in Japanese.

In addition to the basic procedures, we present the extension of our algo- rithm by using the relations among several attributes.

In Section 4, in order to  derive more useful associa- tion rules, we discuss the framework of KQML agents in thc heterogeneous environment. By our proposed framework, we can reduce the number of weighted as- sociation rules effectively, which are derived from the different web resources.

In Section 5, we discuss the effectiveness and per- formance of Mondou systems. Finally, in Section G we make concluding remarks.

2. The architecture of Mondou web search engine  The Mondou consists of the three basic modules, such as database, query server, web robots, which are shown in Figure 1.

WWW Resources  CGI  lrnkr  ?=T Database Figure 1. The structure of Mondou.

The database module handles not only the text in  the web pages, but also the relationship of hyper links.

The major tables in our system are defined as fol- lows: keywords, URLs, hyper links, http servers, I P addresses, and control/management tables for operat- ing the system.

The query s e w e r  is the most important CGI mod- ule, and it provides search results, associative keywords and the attribute values for the visual interface. The algorithms of mining association rules are described in the following Section 3.

The third module, web robot, is also important, which collects the data from the web servers in the internet and intranet, and stores them into the text database. In addition to  the basic functions of the web robot, our web robot parses documents and chooses important keywords by the heuristic operations based on the natural language processing, such as Japanese morphological analysis [18]. Then, the robot select the important attributes, such as ?tit le,  headings and sub- headings, anchor strings, and so on?,  and gives appro- priate weights to  the data. The detail implementation of the web robot is described in Section 4.

Table 1 shows typical examples of derived keywords, the number of URLs and associative keywords derived by our proposed algorithm in this paper.

In the following sections, we explain several techni- cal aspects of Mondou systems using weighted associa- tion rules, information visualization, agent technologies and heterogeneous databases.

3. Data mining in Mondou system  Several algorithms of data mining play an important role in order to support the discovery procedures in the Mondou. The research of data mining[4, 51 is emerg- ing, which is based on various kinds of technologies, such as machine learning, inductive learning, knowl- edge representation, databases, statistics, information visualization and others.

3.1 Weighted association rule  We start a brief introduction to  the mining algo- rithm for association rules[l]. Given a set of docu- ments, where each document consists of keywords, an association rule is an expression X + Y ,  where X and Y are sets of keywords.

The intuitive meaning of such a rule is that docu- ments which contain the keywords X tend to also con- tain the keywords Y. The support of the rule X + Y is the percentage of documents that contain both X and Y .

We easily extend the association algorithm to con- sider frequency and importantness of keywords, which appears in web documents. Our web robot gives the appropriate weight value to the keywords depending on the frequency and the kind of HTML tags.

However, we have to pay our attention that it is very difficult to set the appropriate threshold and weight values in order to derive meaningful rules.

3.2 Association rules derived from different at- tributes  In order to derive more effective rules by Mondou, we classify several attributes and use the relationships of different attributes. Shortly speaking, in order to expand a keyword space, we derive weighted associ- ation rules not only from one attribute but also the relationship among several attributes[l3].

a database.

ex. Author. Publisher. Size. Date,  For example, in order to expand a keyword space appropriately and use several attributes effectively, we categorize attributes in the database into three cate- gories in Table 2 by their semantic properties. And we try to derive meaningful association rules by join operations in these types.

As shown in Table 3, characteristic and supplement attributes generally do not include enough numbers of keywords for association mining, it is hard to derive appropriate rules only from such attributes.

Description 1 Small - Large 1 Abstract 183 Supplement 1 Small 1 Author 3  Therefore, we try to extend the basic algorithm to increase the number of related keywords by giving a relationship of different attributes. which is shown in Figure 2. For example. we give a relationship between Title A,, and Author A, in order t o  expand keywords of Title. Simply speaking, this step means the ex- tension of the keyword space. which is written by the same author. Authors oEten store their related pages in the same directory or under the directory, almost of pages are tightly linked each other. Thus. we can derive inore effective rules based on a relationship of several attributes.

Gather the keywords from A,  in T, and construct a cluster C,.

Repeat Step 3 and Step 4 for each keyword in R and store the clusters into a cluster set L.

Apply our mining association algorithm on C and derive a keyword set &.

Pruning of association rules in the heteroge- neous environment  For example, one of Mondou systems derive the set of association rules from the database, and the other system create the different set of rules. Using the dif- ference of these association rules from heterogeneous databases, we may generate the set of more effective keywords.

Then, we implemented the communication interface of different Mondou systems using agent technologies.

The agents can communicate each other by high level query languages based on the specification of KQML.

Based on this concept, we implemented several Mon- dou systems in order to  handle different web applica- tion systems in Figure 3. The different Mondou system could derive the different set of rules. It is effective to  prune the huge number of rules, even we use low threshold values in the systerns.

In order to  select the keywords, Minsup and Mzncon f threshold values are changed dynamically via the communication of agents. The reason of apply- ing this exchange is that  there is anxiety that a low threshold tends to  derive many associative keywords, and helpful keywords may be buried under them and be overlooked, but a high threshold value tends to re- move even meaningful keywords. In this way to change the threshold dynamically, it is possible to minimize ef- fective keywords to  be removed and maximize effective keywords to  be derived.

For example, the table 4 shows the result of asso- ciation rules from several databases. If user selects  I  Search Interface  HTTP server  WWW Browse  C G I  program  I '  I /t / Refinement I Association Association  Figure 3. Structure of search engine in het- erogeneous environment.

database of ?!fj.rec.foods? as search data domain, what they get are common keywords sets as shown in the following.

{ K,} = { ?olive?} In the case of .?fj.rec.autos?, users will have the fol-  lowing set of keywords.

{ K,} = { ?.engine? , ?oil? , ?exchange? }  After selecting of local databases, you can enter the keyword ?oil? into heterogeneous Mondou systems. Ac- cording t o  the above experiments, agent based Mondou systems may be able to  reduce the size of association rules automatically.

In the case offi.rec.foods (?oil? AND ?olive? ) WEIGHT ( ?Tabascoi?, ?taste?, ?Italy? ~ ?vinegar?, ?olive oil? ! ?spaghetti?, ?eat?, ?white? ! ?cook- ing?)

As the results: each query expression reflects the fea- tures of specified domains. Therefore: heterogeneous Mondou systenis provide you more interesting keywords which are tightly related to  the searching domain. This mechanism must be helpful in order t o  modify initial query expression in the heterogeneous environment.

3.4 Visual interface of Mondou  In the steps of the web documents retrieval, the in- teractive user interface must be useful in order t o  select the appropriate combination of associative keywords.

Moreover, visual interface may be also effective in order to  display the document clusters in the search results.

Then, in order to  visualize the characteristics of asso- ciation rules and the distribution of document clusters, we have been developing an interactive visual interface as Java applets based on the technique of information visualization[lG].

In Figure 4, this 3D graph shows the scores of de- rived keywords based on ROC graphs[lO, 221. We also implemented fisheye graph drawing techniques[l2].

By the mouse operations, users can select combina- tion of keywords easily. For example, in the Fig.

4, by the query with a keyword ?mediator?: Mon- dou display associative keywords, such as ?informa- t ion?,  ?data?,  ?distributed?, ?supporting?, ?connec- tions?, ?personal? and others.

In the Figure 5 ,  the numerical number shows the related clusters of documents satisfying the combi- nation of selected black keywords.

4. Data cleaning aspect of web robots  When we implement the program of web robot more effectively, it is very important to  collect meaningful web pages fast. Therefore, in the following subsections, we focus on the mining techniques in the view points of data cleaning.

4.1 Simple guideline of robot architecture  The web robots collect the data using ht tp  proto- cols. For instance, the web robot send the following characters in Table.5 in order to  retrieve the web data from servers.

The simple web robot visits web servers sequentially with the following breadt h-first algorithm.

Web robots developers also have to  pay the attention t o  the behavior of the robot by the ? / robots .  t x t  file?, according t o  the robots guideline[l7].

4.2 Focused crawling algorithm by hyper links  When we browse web pages, we usually t ry  to evalu- ate the relationship between the target page and other web links. Therefore, in this subsection, we t ry  to  char- acterize the structure of hyper links, in order to  develop fast traversing techniques of important clusters of web pages in the same and different web servers.

- inside links outside links ............ *  _.--....__ ?*.. site  . ... . ..____ /**  Figure 6, Features of hyper links, in- side/outside links.

As you know very well, we can depict the web links as loosely connected hyper graph, we try to discover the interesting features of the web pages based on the two different hyper links.

0 Inside link: the link to  other pages on the same web server.

0 Outside link: the link to  other pages on the other web servers.

In the first step, we give the score of hyper links by these values ( s p ,  ip, o p ) ,  which is the combination of the document size, the number of inside links, and the number of outside links for the parent document P in Figure 6. Then, each child document CI, is referred from the parent P ,  we can also evaluate ( s k ,  i k ,  01,) val- ues for C k .

We proposed the following focused crawling algo- rithm, based on the assumption that the important web pages are referred many times from other servers.

Algorithm 3 (Focused crawling algorithm)  1. Define the following sets about server s:   mailto:infocom-w3-search@kuamp.kyoto-u.ac.jp http://www.kuamp.kyoto-u.ac.jp   G, : K,  :  0,:  Set of URLs on s to be obtained  Set of URLs on s that has already been ob- tained  Set of URLs on s to be obtained referred from other server  2. if G, # 4, then  3.

12. K ,  = K,  U { d } .

5. Evaluation of Mondou search engine  Mondou system started to  collect web resources from the end of 1995, and we provided the search pages from February in 1996. Based on the operating log files, we examined the statistics of search queries, patterns of combination of keywords and many other features.

In the previous papers, we discussed that it is very difficult to describe various combination of appropriate keywords. There are only about 2.00% queries with NOT expression, i t  may be impossible for users to de- scribe the query with adequate NOT expressions. Fur- thermore, according to the statistics of Mondou system, most of users try to  modify their queries according to the information of derived association rules.

For exampje, most of queries (84.8%) for Mondou consists of more than two keywords, therefore our pro- posed mining algorithms increased the complexity of queries effectively. Keywords including all executed queries covered more than 40.5% for all 340,919 key- words, which are stored in the database.

Consequently, users can easily select the interesting combination of keywords by data mining and informa- tion visualization in Mondou system.

We also discussed that the executing cost for deriv- ing associative keywords was from 2 to 3 times as much  as the cost of the full text search procedure. it forces users to wait so long time. Then. we iniplemented the sampling mechanism in our system. is order to reduces the deriving cost.

Moreover. there has been research efforts in order to optimize the space and time consuming costs for pre-processing, which is called as materialization[8].

The technique of materialization is also one of effec- tive ways to reduce the executing cost. When Mondou systems materialize the association rules by using key- words which appear in many queries, and scan the ma- terialized association rules to return the result, we can reduce the waiting time dramatically[ll]. Of course.

parallel computing and cluster architectures must be effective for data mining.

We have already implemented several kinds of meth- ods, such as sampling. materialization and parallel computing, and had evaluations of these techniques in (131.

6. Conclusions  The scale of web communities is increasing espo- nentially, it makes hard to discover the useful or suit- able resources including informative knowledge. A i d in the case of search for common information resources.

it is very difficult to determine the combination of key- words.

In order to resolve these problems, we developed the Mondou search system. In this paper. we described the overview of Mondou in the view points of data min- ing technologies. such as text mining, web mining and information visualization.

Especially, we discussed that it was effective for users to decide the combination of keywords using the associative keywords and the visual interface. Finally, we can conclude that our proposed algorithms and vi- sual interface work very effectively for web searches.

At present, we discussed the primitive conimunica- tion protocols for community oriented web search en- gines and the basic characteristics of the web communi- ties derived from web graphs[l5]. Then. we are trying to implement the advanced communication protocols in order to derive more reliable results from the web communities. Since the quality and the reliability of web contents are tightly related to the members (or web pages) in web communities.
