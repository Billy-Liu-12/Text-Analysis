2012 IEEE Students? Conference on Electrical, Electronics and Computer Science

Abstract? In this paper a system for voice of customer  analysis is proposed, which will produce strong rules to  help organization to take business decisions. It uses  parallel association rule mining for rule generation and  data usually tends to be very huge so partitioning is done  on the basis of sentiment of customer. For this purpose text  mining algorithm is used which extracts information from  unstructured data. On these partitions of data association  rule mining algorithm is applied which determines strong  association rules and kept in a database. Domain experts  can use these rules to take business decisions which can  help an organization to have a better understanding of  customer?s all needs and wants.

Keywords voice of customer analysis, text mining, parallel  association rule mining, sentiment analysis.



I. INRODUCTION  oice of customer analysis is all about in-depth market  research which produces customer needs and wants.

Market basket analysis is a good way to provide  scientific decision support for retail market by mining  association relationships among items people purchased  together. Mining results may not be interesting to people since  they don?t show semantic associations among items. However,  the consequence may be different if association rules are  mined on items? internal characteristics.

All the needs and wants of customers are needed to  be considered for the start of new product.. Voice of customer  will help understanding the customer?s requirement. Now a  days product should not only have ?nothing wrong? but should  also maximize positive quality such as ease of use and  convenience, which adds value to product and leads for  customer satisfaction. So voice of customer can be used for  quality function deployment (QFD) and detailed design  specification    Voice Of Customer:  Voice of Customer (VoC) refers to customer  communications such as conversational voice, Recordings,  Emails, text messages, chat transcripts, agent notes. Most of  the VoC is collected through contact centres. Apart from  deriving valuable insights through contact centres it is possible  to influence the customer back through contact centres based  on those insights.  However, carrying this out in an effective  manner requires effective BI systems for VoC.Voice of  customer may contain Phrases that provide valuable feedback  to the enterprise, Phrases that refer to service quality issues  and point to efficiency lapses. VoC also reflect the sentiments  and opinions of the customers and indicate the level of  (dis)satisfaction of the customer or his churn propensity. VoC  also point to the products, services and features customers are  interested in.

Enterprises have access to such kind of valuable  information only through the VoC. However VoC is often  noisy with multilingual phrases, unconventional abbreviations  and short hands, spelling and grammatical mistakes.

There are three major issues in using VoC for BI.

1) The first challenge is data quality. VoC data is noisy and  contains not only spelling and grammatical mistakes, but also  inconsistent and incomplete sentences.

2) The second major challenge is in integrating the VoC with  other enterprise structured and unstructured data.

3) The third challenge in using VoC for BI is in storing and  processing large volumes of data. This is in fact a major issue  for the conversational speech data.



II. BASIC PRINCIPLES    2.1 Association Rule Mining  Let T be the set of transactions where each transaction is a  subset of the item-set I.

Let C be a subset of I, then we define the support count of C  with respect to T to be:    ?(c) = I{tl t ? T, C is subset of t}l.

V  mailto:Shubha.1907@gmail.com   SCEECS 2012  An association rule is an expression of the form  X ->Y,where X and Y are subset of I.

Support s of the rule is defined as     ?(XUY)/lTl  confidence of the rule is defined as   ?(XUY)/?(X)  For example consider the rule  {1,2}->{3}  i.e. items 1, 2 implies 3    The support of a rule is important, since it indicates how  frequent the rule is in the transactions. Rules that have very  small support are often uninteresting, since they do not  describe significantly large populations.So algorithms discard  the candidates having support less than as that of minimum  support. Often the value of minimum support is defined by  user.

APRIORI Algorithm  It?s an algorithm for finding frequent item set using candidate  generation. Apriori algorithm prunes search space at Kth level  by considering the precise support at   K-1th level. To do this  task efficiently, a hash tree is maintained in which all potential  candidates of size K resides. Transactions do not require to be  stayed in main memory only hash tables reside in main  memory. There are some problems with this algorithm  1) Size of the main memory in serial computers puts upper  limit on the size of hash table.

2) Even with the highly effective pruning method of  APRIORI, the task of mining association rules requires a lot of  computation power that is only possible with parallel  computers.

Parallel computers can solve these problems with  increased memory and with a lot of computation power. For  the application of voice of customer analysis we have used  hybrid algorithm which is parallel algorithm for rule  generation.

2.2 Association Rule mining for unstructured data: Above  shown method is good enough for finding frequent item-sets  in structured database. When we are trying to find association  rules in unstructured data then we are looking for one is the  large number of items and combinations of items that need to  be counted. And other one is the large number of items in each  document in the database. So from this discussion it may be  concluded that text database miners need to work with item-  sets composed of words that are not too frequent, but are  frequent enough.

Rules that can be generated from association rule mining in  unstructured data can be for a product or feature of a product  Such as  1) (Windows7 provides satisfactory performance).

2) (Kaspersky is well suited antivirus software for small  Organizations).

2.3 Parallel association rule mining  To provide parallel computing environment a parallel  association rule mining is needed, which can be scaled up with  the increasing size of data. As complaint databases are very  huge and customer?s response is very necessary for  organizations so need for parallel algorithm for mining also  increases. To solve all these requirements hybrid algorithm is  used which is discussed in next section.



III. HYBRID ALGORITHM    The IDD algorithm [4]  exploits the total system memory while  minimizing the communication overhead involved. As more  processors are used, the number of candidates assigned to each  processor decreases. This has two implications with fewer  numbers of candidates per processor; it is much more difficult  to balance the work. Second, the smaller number of candidates  gives a smaller hash tree and less computation work per data.

Eventually the amount of computation may be less than the  communication involved, and this reduces overall efficiency.

If a system that cannot perform asynchronous communication  then it will be more serious problems. HD algorithm is  combination of CD and IDD algorithms.

3.1 Architectural description of Association Rule  Generation:  The processors are being arranged in a two dimensional grid  of G rows and P/G columns. The transactions are partitioned  equally among the P processors, and the candidate set ck is  partitioned among the processors of each column of this grid.

This partitioning of Ck is the same for each column of  processors, that is, the processors along each row of the grid  get the same subset of Ck. Now, the IDD algorithm is  executed independently along each column of the grid, and the  total counts of each subset of Ck is obtained by performing a  reduction operation along the rows of this processor grid.  In  the HD algorithm, we execute the CD algorithm as if there  were only P/G processors. The HD algorithm determines the  configuration of the processor grid dynamically. A parameter  C is taken into consideration if it is less than number of  candidates M then switch to CD algorithm, if not then G=M/C  groups are formed and a logical GXP/G processor mesh  configuration.

? P/G Hypothetical processors computes the local counts of all the candidate item-sets.

? Then the global counts can be computed by performing the global reduction operation.

SCEECS 2012                Parallel Rule Generation  Step 2 i.e. problem of generating rules from frequent item-set  can also be parallelized for which parallel rule generation  algorithm is used. Given a frequent item-set l, rule generation  examines each nonempty subset a and generates the rule a? (l  - a) with  support= support(l) and  confidence = support(l)/support(a).

This computation can efficiently be done by examining the  largest subsets of I first and only proceeding to smaller subsets  if the generated rules have the required minimum confidence.

To generate rules in parallel partitioning the set of all frequent  item-sets among the processors is done. Above algorithm is  used by each processor to generate rule in each partition. we  attempt to balance the load by partitioning the item-sets of  each length equally across the processors. each processor must  have access to all the frequent item-sets before rule generation  can begin.

PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE FOR VOICE OF CUSTOMER  ANALYSIS  Main Components of the Architecture  -Sentiment analysis  -Text mining using genetic algorithm  -Association rule mining combined with genetic algorithm  -Business analysis  Main motive of this system is to provide an integrated model  which can be used by an organization for analysis purpose of  VoC. As said earlier the analysis can be done on complaint  data which in turn will help to minimize the negative things or  can be for analyzing the needs of customers at the time of  designing new products.

Detail description of each module is given below  1) Sentiment Alnalysis Sentiment analysis or opinion mining refers to the  application of natural language processing, computational  linguistics, and text analytics to identify and extract subjective  information in source materials. Generally speaking, sentiment  analysis aims to determine the attitude of a speaker or a writer  with respect to some topic or the overall tonality of a  document. The attitude may be his or her judgment or  evaluation , affective state (that is to say, the emotional state  of the author when writing), or the intended emotional  communication (that is to say, the emotional effect the author  wishes to have on the reader).

The large sizes of the database and the total item set  also require large memory and disk spaces. As the size of the  modern databases increases, it is very difficult to use a single  processor for the data mining tasks.

SCEECS 2012  Here is where the parallel processing techniques  come in and  help. The combination of the search space and database  partitioning allows parallel processors to mine the frequent  closed item-sets independently, Which in turn minimizes the  inter-processor communication and synchronization. The  partitioning also ensures the load balance among the parallel  processors. with the help of Sentiment analysis data  partitioning is done in the proposed system. Sentiment  analysis allows partitioning of data according  to sentiments of  the customer.

? For example appraisal documents and complaints documents can be partitioned into two different  databases which in turns allow discovery of related  products for which complaints are there.

? Accordingly business decisions can be taken.

The essential issues in sentiment analysis are to identify  how sentiments are expressed in texts and whether the  expressions indicate positive (favorable) or negative  (unfavorable) opinions toward the subject. In order to improve  the accuracy of the sentiment analysis, it is important to  properly identify the semantic relationships between the  sentiment expressions and the subject.

2) Text mining Unstructured data in the form of email, chats, and phone  transcripts can comprise up to 80% of your enterprise  customer data. How should you be managing this valuable  data? It?s a very important question that needs to be answered.

Text mining algorithm mines diverse data sources from  routine customer service interactions - including audio  recordings, call transcripts, emails, survey results and  demographic data - to deliver a single, integrated view of  customer sentiment to improve marketing effectiveness,  enhance customer service and grow customer loyalty.

The growing availability of online textual sources and the  potential number of applications of knowledge acquisition  from textual data has led to an increase in Information  Extraction (IE) research.

Some issues that need to be considered when  performing text mining    SMS and email data is noisy. This is because  customers use very informal language and do not bother about  spelling or grammar. Moreover they often use two or more  languages to express themselves. They also tend to use  unconventional abbreviations and short hands for words and  sentences. Often emails and sms are received from people who  are not customers of the enterprise and most of these emails  contain junk information not related to enterprise operations.

For all these purpose cleaning of E-mail and SMS is required.

For the given system we have used genetic algorithm along  with text mining for knowledge discovery.

In the figure architecture is given for text mining using  genetic algorithm                           3) Association Rule Mining This step has been discussed above. Structure of database on  which algorithm will be applied will be like this  Item-Set ID  1st  key word  2nd key word  ???.. Nth keyword   .

.

.

n-2    n-1  n  Each tuple will have keywords from same document. This  tuple will act as item-set for apriori analysis.

4) Business Analysis As in step of association rule mining rules have been  generated for specific domains, business analysis can be done.

5) Handling of issues ? First issue i.e. noisy data is being handled by using  text mining algorithm which is doing work of  information extraction.

? Second issue i.e. of integration of structured and unstructured data is being handled also by text  mining  ? Third issue of handling large database is being handled using data partitioning according to the  sentiments of the customer.

6) Advantages An engine to link VoC to structured database, which is  specially a challenging task given the fact that VoC is  usually very noisy.

SCEECS 2012  1) An integrated architecture for extracting business insights through analysis of large collection of  structured and unstructured data.

2) Rule generation in parallel is a great advantage of system which is less time consuming as compared to  earlier algorithms.

3) Data partition is done on the basis of sentiment which may benefit different business analysts to have a deep  insight for making business decisions.

4) Customer satisfaction is what every company wants by using this system an organization may know about  customer?s requirements.

7) Comparison with earlier systems for voice of customer  analysis  ? This system is providing parallelism for generation of association rule this was not in earlier system. By  using association rule algorithm in parallel we can  have advantage of time. Very less time will be taken  for generation of association rule generation.

? Data partitioning is also an advantage of this system which is according to the sentiments of the customer.

This module of the system is very advantageous and  giving domain experts to concentrate on only there  business area. Problem of handling huge database is  also handles as now data is partitioned into number of  small segment.



IV. CONCLUSION  Great achievement in term of time can be achieved by using  this system as it is deriving association rules in parallel.

Hybrid algorithm used for parallel algorithm is very efficient  in terms of time as compared to algorithms that were already  proposed. Sentiment analysis is being used with text mining  algorithm which allows data to be partitioned according to the  sentiments.
