A High-Order Analysis of the Distortion Effects of Nonlinear Amplifiers on CDMA Signals

Abstract This paper presents a direct method of analyzing the distortion effects of the power amplifier nonlinearity on the CDMA signal. In the analysis approach of the paper, the various user signals, which are composed of data-modulated Walsh codes, which are also modulated by various scrambling codes, are modeled as independent random sequences. These sequences are band limited, using square- root raised cosine filters and modulated by a carrier frequency before being input to the nonlinear power amplifier. In the analysis approach of the paper, the amplifier characteristics are approximated by a polynomial of sufficiently high degree such that over the range of input signal, the approximation error is negligible. For the region of amplifier operation of interest in this paper, terms of degree higher than forty may be needed compared to an earlier simplified analysis presented by the author wherein only cubic distortion terms have been considered.
