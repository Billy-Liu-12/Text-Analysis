Comparing Frequent Patterns: A Study Case of Apriori and Singleton Implementations in a

Abstract?Frequent sequential pattern (FSP) mining has be- come an effective tool to explore the pattern sequence occurrences in many fields. The methods developed in FSP is mainly based on Apriori algorithm. This algorithm looks for frequent sequence of itemset which need not to be consecutive. In addition, the itemset that supports the cardinality of a frequent sequence can be a partial itemset. However, in the case of medication for diabetes type 2, the selection of patient medication is considered essential.

A combination of medications represents the clinical conditions of the patients. Therefore, we considered a medication combination as one full item sets (i.e., singleton). We are interested in the transition events from one medication episode to the next.

As such, we consider consecutive sequence of singleton. This paper studies the result characteristic of Apriori-based FSP and singleton mining. The result of this study shows that the singleton mining results set is the subset of Apriori-based algorithm, with 0.203 of ratio value. However, Apriori-based algorithm results set contains frequent sequence pattern of medication transition event which is unlikely to happen in real clinical conditions with high frequency. By contrast, the singleton mining results set represents the true medication transition event.

I. INTRODUCTION  Frequent sequential pattern (FSP) mining was developed for application to solve the market basket, that is to study customer behavior [1]. FSP mining utilizes a sequence database of cus- tomer transactions to look for the maximal sequence of itemset patterns that have a support value greater than a threshold value defined by the user. The support value is counted based on the occurrences of the pattern in the sequence database. The maximal sequence pattern is the sequence that is not contained in other super sequential patterns.

FSP approach is a practical method of finding frequent sequence event and has been applied many fields. For example in the medical field, in the area of postcare, [2] report an application regarding patients in the follow-up of liver transplantation, [3] reports a study on the ICU patients to detect recent events, and in the field of pharmacovigilance,  [4] presents an investigation of adverse drug reaction using FSP mining.

And recently, in the area of chronic diseases such as diabetes type 2, the FSP approach is also used to mine electronic medical records (EMR). Diabetes type 2 is a typical chronic disease associated with its high numbers of risk factors and parameters that affect the therapy. FSP mining enable user to yield new insights from existing therapy data regarding the medication trend or guideline adherence. In [5], new clinical condition of diabetes type 2 patients were found compared to the medical guidelines and [6] uses FSP mining to predict the next prescribed medicine in monotherapeutically medicated diabetes type 2 patients.

Our interest is in observing the medication transition events to learn about physician?s strategy in managing the illness.

Current method demonstrate FSP mining on monotherapy [6], whereas in reality, physician?s prescriptions may vary from monotherapy to multitherapy. Furthermore, in the case of diabetes, the selection of pharmacotherapy is considered essential [7]. The appropriate combination of medications should be selected in accordance with the patient conditions.

Thus, using Apriori as it is may result in patterns that do not represent the actual medications. This is because Apriori- based FSP mining finds frequent sequence of items set that can be a partial item sets. In addition, Apriori-based algorithm considers sequences that may not occur consecutively. By contrast, we consider the consecutive order of the sequence.

In order to solve the type of problem considered here, we introduced singleton mining in [8]. The difference between singleton mining and Apriori-based FSP mining is as shown as follows: In Apriori algorithm, the sequence of ?1? ? ?6? is contained in ?1, 3? ? ?3, 5? ? ?3, 6?; whereas in singleton mining, it is not considered as an instance of sequence.

In this paper, we present a comparative study between singleton mining and Apriori-based FSP mining to investi- gate the pattern results produced by both methods, in order to survey the characteristic of both methods? results. The      structure of the rest of the paper consists of as follows : In Section II, we introduce the theoretical background, including that on diabetes, medication episode reconstruction, frequent sequence mining and singleton mining. Section III provides an explanation of the methods used used to compare both mining result. Then, we will discuss the result in Section IV, and finally, we conclude the results in section V.



II. THEORY BACKGROUND  A. Diabetes  Diabetes is a progressive chronic diseases. It may lead to increases in risk factors for other conditions, such as heart dis- ease, amputation, and kidney failure. The treatment is patient centered and span the patient?S life time. The disease must be managed through comprehensive longitudinal medical care.

In treating diabetes patients, a physician considers the patient condition when prescribing medication. Thus for one patient, a physician may recommend only a change of lifestyle, whereas for others, the physician may recommend pharmachotherapy.

Such pharmacotherapy also varies, taking the form of either monotherapy or multitherapy. Prescriptions also may differ from one physician to the other. For example, one physician may consider a patient as slim, so the physician prescribes medicine with certain dosage. But other physician may feel the same patient as a little bit fatty, so he may prescribe medicine with different dosage. Hence, different combinations of diabetes medication represent different patient conditions.

Although prescription practices for diabetes medication seems to be varied greatly, medical societies published medical guidelines as standard recommendation for treating diabetes.

Based on these medical guidelines, the recommended therapy is begin with diet therapy and monotherapy and then proceed to dual therapy, triple therapy, a combination therapy with injection drugs, or switching to insulin therapy [7]. In a sense, a patient?s sequence of medications reflects the phases of that patient?s conditions. Thus, both medications and their sequence are relevant to diabetes treatment.

B. Medication Episode Reconstruction  In order to give an illustration of the data set, in this section we briefly explain the process of reconstructing medication episodes from prescription data. A Prescription P (pid, s, e,m[], d[]) is a tuple of pid patient id, s starting time, e end time, m[] array of medicine label, and d[] array of medicine dosages w.r.t. the medicine label. Table I shows the prescription data set for the physician?s prescription for a patient with pid 7 from January 2014 until December 2015.

Figure 1 illustrates the prescription diagram for Table I.

Figure 1(a) displays the prescription durations and medicine labels. In Figure 1(a), we can see that a prescription can have a short duration due to regulation, and that it occasionally overlaps another or has a gap. This happens because a patient may come earlier or later than the physician appointment time. We also observe is that some prescriptions are simply continuations of the previous medication.

The term ?near? is used in the sense of |Pi+1.s? Pi.e| ? ?.

Here, ? is the notion of the time error margin which was introduced by [9] and used by [10] in temporal pattern mining to relax the left side of Allen?s temporal relation[11], shown in Figure 2. We use these temporal relations to determine the prescription relations which later used for assigning the reconstruction rules. The complete rules of reconstruction have been reported in [8].

Example 1: Using P2, P3, P4, and P5 of Table II and ? = 7 days, we have two prescription relations as follows :  P3.s - P2.e < ? ? P1 meets P2 P7.s - P6.e > ? ? P6 before P7  For an ? value of 14 days, we identify six medication episodes after prescriptions reconstruction, as shown in Figure 1(b). Afterward, a minimum period is used to distinguish the medication episode types and identify stable period as shown in Figure 1(c). The minimum period is chosen based on the recommendation given in the medical guideline, which state a physician must wait some amount of time to observe the effectiveness of a given medication [7]. Figure 1(b) illustrates the use of a minimum period of 3 months as the threshold value for a medication episode to be regarded as a stable period. An unstable period corresponds to short medication changes that may occur when the physician tried to adjust the medication or because of hospitalization. Thus, to find the effective medication pattern in the long term, we consider stable periods to be essential for further analysis.

Definition 1: Medication Episode ME is a concatenation of meets prescriptions that have the same medicine label and dosage. ME shows the period of time when the physician does not change the prescription. An ME data set is a sequence of ME?s [ME1,ME2, . . . ,MEm], where ME?s are ordered by starting time.

Example 2: From Table II, P1 meets P2 and P1.m[] = P2.m[] and P1.d[] = P2.d[] ? ME1; hence the concatenation of P1 and P2 makes an ME.

Fig. 1. Physician?s prescription diagram as shown in Table I.

Fig. 2. Allen?s left-side temporal relation using epsilon  Definition 2: Threshold ? is the minimum period, in days, for the physician to view the medication as effective.

Definition 3: Medication Episodes can be classified into Stable Period (SP) and Trial/Short Period (TP) according to their duration. An ME is an SP if ME.e ? ME.s ? ?, and is a TP otherwise. Unstable period (UP) is a single TP or an aggregation of consecutive TPs. The data set of SP of an ME data set is the subset of the ME data set comprising of all MEs which are SPs.

Definition 4: Blank period BP is a period of time when there was no medication recorded in the medical history more than ? days.

C. Frequent Sequential Pattern Mining  A sequential pattern is a set of itemsets that is structured in a sequence database which occurs sequentially with a specific order [12]. A sequence database is a set of ordered elements or events, stored either with or without a concrete notion of time. Each itemset contains a set of items associated the same transaction time.

One example of such pattern, as described in [1], can be found in a video rental transactions. Customers may typically rent ?Iron Man?, followed by ?Iron Man 2?, and then ?Iron Man 3?. The sequence of the rentals need not be consecutive and partial itemset also support the sequential pattern. An itemset is denoted by < i1, i2, ..in >, where i is an item and n is the number of items. A sequence of (x1, x2, ..xi) is con- tained in other sequence (y1, y2, ..yj) if there exists integers i1 < i2 < ... < in such that x1 ? yi1 , x2 ? yi2 , ..xn ? yin [1].

Example 3: The sequence ?3,4? ? ?3? ? ?1,4? is contained in ?3,4? ? ?3,5? ? ?1,3,5? ? ?1,4? ? ?1,4,6?, because ?3,4? ? ?3,4?, ?3? ? ?3,5? and ?1,4? ? ?1,4?. However, the sequence ?1? ? ?4? is not contained in ?1, 4?.

Apriori principle is that if a sequence is frequent then the itemsets, which constructed it, must be also frequent. An itemset is considered frequent if it has a support value equal or greater than the minimum support value that is previously  defined. Using the Apriori principle, itemsets that are not frequent and their super sequences will be pruned.

An implementation of Apriori algorithm is SPADE (Se- quential Pattern Discovery using Equivalence classes)[13].

SPADE transforms the horizontal database (i.e., conventional database based on the user id which consists of tuples of user id, transaction time and set of items) into a vertical database (i.e., database consist with tuples of item id, user id and transaction times). This strategy proposed by [13] makes sequential pattern mining more efficient [6]. The current version of SPADE is cSPADE which is available in R in arulessequences package.[14]  D. Singleton Mining Pattern Model  As stated in the previous section, we are interested in investigating the transition events between stable periods.

Stable periods represent medications that have proven effective for the patient?s conditions. We define a medication pattern as a repeated consecutive of medication found in the SP sequence data set. We consider two types of medication patterns, as follows :  1) A singleton pattern is the pattern of a single SP. The singleton pattern may be stated based on the medicine name, medicine type, or medicine label. In the case of diabetes, it may take the form of monotherapy, dual therapy, triple therapy or more.

2) n-sequence pattern is a sequence pattern consisting n+1 consecutive singletons.

The support of the pattern is calculated as the ratio of num- ber of patients who exhibit the pattern, at least once in their longitudinal medical history, to the total number of patients, Sup(Theraphy) = |?patient with therapy |/|  ? patient |.

Example 4: Table II presents the medication type transitions of the stable periods from six patients? medical record. The number inside the bracket denote the medicine type and the arrow represents the transition. For example, the patient with pid 1 has medication transition from dual therapy with medicine types 1 and 3 to dual therapy with medicine types 3 and 5 and then followed by the subsequent transition to dual therapy with medicines types 3 and 6. Hence, from Table IV, with a minimum support value of 0.2, we can find four singleton pattern as follows: ?1?, ?1, 4?, ?3, 5?, ?1, 4, 6?.

The 1-sequence patterns are as follows : ?1? ? ?1, 4?, and ?1, 4? ? ?1, 4, 6?.

TABLE III MEDICATION TYPES  No Medication Type 1 Sulfonylurea (SU) 2 Rapid-acting insulin secretagogues (RaIS) 3 ?-Glucosidase inhibitors 4 Biguanides 5 Thiazolidinediones 6 DPP-4 inhibitors  This pattern definition is different from that used to generate Apriori-based FSP results. In Apriori, it considers that the occurrences of a subset of the singleton support the frequent sequence and the even though the sequence does not in a consecutive manner it will add the cardinality of the pattern.

Example 5: For the data in Table II and a minimum support value of 0.2, Apriori-based FSP mining will indicate ?4, 6? as a frequent pattern with support value of 0.5 and ?1, 4? ? ?1, 4, 6? as another frequent pattern with a support value of 0.5. By contrast, when singleton mining is applied, ?4, 6? is not considered as a frequent pattern because it is not a full itemset, where as for ?1, 4? ? ?1, 4, 6? pattern, the calculated support value is only 0.33 because the patient with pid 6 is not counted as supporting the pattern support.



III. METHOD  A. Data set  We used a stable-period data set of 53,444 records originat- ing from prescription data for 2,816 diabetes type 2 patients provided by Kyoto University Hospital. The data set contains information about the pid, start time, end time, and the combination of medication types. The medication types are listed in Table III based on [7].

B. Setting  We conducted an experiment of finding frequent sequence patterns out of the data set using cSPADE (R-arulessequences) which is the implementation of Apriori-based FSP mining and our own method of singleton mining. Afterward, we inspected the result and compared the patterns set. The comparison was performed by measuring the similarity score. Figure 3 summarizes the experimental setting.

C. Similarity Measurement  A common similarity function is proposed to compute the ratio between the number of rules from one rule set that occur  Fig. 3. Experiment Setting  in another rule set [15]. Suppose that there are two rule sets R1 = r1, r2, ..., ri and R2 = r1, r2, ..., rj , where i and j, repectively, are the number of rules in the two rule sets. The overlapping of rules between sets is a basic measure to investi- gate the common properties of rule sets. The overlapping ratio as similarity function between a pair of rule sets is typically defined as Overlap(R1, R2) = |R1 ?R2|/|R1 ?R2| [15].

However, this similarity function is not appropriate for mea- suring the similarity between the mining results of the methods considered here. Since the Apriori algorithm does not require consecutive order of sequence or full itemset, the results of cSPADE (FPcspade) will be a superset of the singleton min- ing results (FPsingleton). Moreover, because FPsingleton ? FPcspade, the overlap score between FPsingleton and FPcspade will be: Overlap|FPsingleton, FPcspade| = |FPsingleton|/|FPsingleton ? FPcspade|. Hence, the overlap score will always be the ratio of FPsingleton and FPcspade.

We obtain value of 0.203 for the ratio value of FPsingleton and FPcspade.

A different similarity measure can be calculated using the Kendal rank correlation coefficient, commonly referred to as Kendall?s Tau coefficient. This quantity is a statistic used to measure rank correlation (i.e., the similarity of the orderings of the data when ranked by each of two quantities[16]). Kendall?s Tau represents the difference between the probability that the observed data will appear in the same order versus the probability that the observed data will not appear in the same order [17].

The equation of Kendall?s Tau is the ratio between of the difference and the sum of the numbers of the concordant pairs and the discordant pairs, ? = (C ? D)/(C + D)[18]. A concordant pair is when the rank of the second variable is greater that the rank of the former variable. As a discordant pair is when the rank is equal to or less that the rank of the first variable [19].

Because Kendall?s Tau is used to measure the order simi- larity between two rank sets of the same data but FPsingleton and FPcspade differ in numbers as FPsingleton ? FPcspade, there exist FPsingleton \ FPcspade = {x ? FPcspade|x /?     Fig. 4. Kendall?s Tau solution  FPsingleton}. For this case, we propose an alternative solution as follows. Prior to the calculating of the Kendall?s Tau, we prune out the result members of FPcspade that are the complement of FPsingleton, such that FP ?cspade = FPcspade? Rsingleton. In this way, we obtain two rank sets which have the same members (FPsingleton = FP ?cspade). Figure 4 illustrates the pruning of FPcspade.



IV. DISCUSSION  In this section, we do not evaluate the performances of the two methods because our interest lies in the pattern results. Instead, we inspect the pattern results by ranking the pattern sets based on the support value in descending order.

In addition, our study limitation is that it is a single hospital (not multi-centered) study.

Table IV shows the top 20 results with the highest support values among the patterns identified by the singleton mining algorithm and the Apriori-based mining algorithm. The num- bers combination inside the bracket represent the medication type?s number as listed on Table III. From Table IV, we can observe that three patterns have the same rank, such as pattern no 1,2, and 5. However, the rankings of other patterns are jumbled. Some patterns appear in the same order in both sets of results; for example, the set of {?1?, ?1? ? ?1?, ?1,4?, ?1,4? ? ?1,4?} has the same order in both FPsingleton and FPcspade. By contrast, the pattern ?3? comes after pattern ?1,4? in FPsingleton, where as in FPcspade, the ordering of these patterns is the opposite. Furthermore, patterns with the same base stem (antecedent) and consequent may have different ranks when ordered based on the base stem. For example the pattern with the base stem ?1,4? and consequent ?1,4? is ranked first in FPsingleton but third in FPcspade after ?1,4? ? ?1? and ?1,4? ? ?4?.

We also consider the deviations in the support values, as shown in Table V. From Table V, we observe that Apriori- based algorithm produces higher support value than singleton mining and that there are 13 patterns have support deviation > 0.1 out of 20 patterns.

For the rank similarity analysis, Kendall?s Tau takes values between minus one and plus one. A positive correlation signifies that the rankings in both lists are increasing [17]. By contrast, the negative correlation signifies that as the ranking  TABLE IV TOP 20 MOST FREQUENT PATTERN SETS IDENTIFIED THROUGH  SINGLETON MINING AND APRIORI-BASED MINING  No FPsingleton FPcspade 1 ?1? ?1? 2 ?1? ? ?1? ?1? ? ?1? 3 ?1,4? ?6? 4 ?1,3? ?4? 5 ?3? ?3? 6 ?1,4? ? ?1,4? ?4? ? ?4? 7 ?4? ?1? ? ?6? 8 ?1,6? ?3? ? ?3? 9 ?2? ?6? ? ?6? 10 ?6? ?1? ? ?4? 11 ?1? ? ?1,4? ?1,4? 12 ?3? ? ?3? ?4? ? ?1? 13 ?1,3? ? ?1,3? ?1? ? ?1,4? 14 ?1,4,6? ?1,6? 15 ?4? ? ?4? ?1,4? ? ?1? 16 ?1,6? ? ?1,6? ?1,4? ? ?4? 17 ?1,3,4? ?4? ? ?1,4? 18 ?2? ? ?2? ?1? ? ?1,6? 19 ?4,6? ?1,4? ? ?1,4? 20 ?1? ? ?1,6? ?3? ? ?1?

The Kendall?s Tau score for FPcspade and FFsingleton is 0.42, which means that although FPcspade and FPsingleton do have a positive correlation (in both result sets, the ranking increases), this correlation is moderately low.

In addition to general characteristic of both result sets, we are able to yield a finding from the medical point of view. Our finding is that by inspecting Table IV, the domain expert identify that the transition from medication type 1 (Sulfonylurea,SU) to medication type 6 (DPP4i), as shown in row 7 of FPcspade, is unlikely to happen in high frequency. In the case of the characteristics of Kyoto University Hospital, a     physician usually used medication which is the first medication prescribed to the patient as a basic medication. And when the medication progress, the physician will use the basic medica- tion and combine it with other medication. This behavior is demonstrated by FPsingleton pattern in row 11 (?1? ? ?1,4?) and row 20 (?1? ? ?1,6?) where SU are changed into a dual therapy of ?1? ? ?1,*?.

The support value of ?1? ? ?6? pattern yields a high number in FPcspade set. It is because Apriori algorithm permits partial itemsets and not consecutive order of sequences to support the pattern. Thus, the sequence ?*,1,*? ? * ?*,6,*? supports ?1? ? ?6? pattern. Considering this fact, to make use of FPcspade set, as it is, for a suggestion application based on the support rank value may lead to biased interpretation. For example, in the case of pattern ?1? ? ?6? in FPcspade, the user may infer that there are medication transition with high frequency from medication SU to DPP4i, whereas in contrast, it has much lower frequency as recorded in the patient medical history.

Compared to FPsingleton set, the support value deviation of the transition is 0.320293 (supcspade ? supsingleton).



V. CONCLUSION  In this paper, we have demonstrated that FSP mining based on the Apriori algorithm yields a superset of the results of singleton mining. However, the two methods rank intersection members in different order based on the support value in the case of the multitherapy of diabetes type 2 patients. This find- ing is confirmed by the rank based similarity score between the frequent pattern sets, which is calculated using Kendall?s Tau coefficient (Kendall?sTau(FPcspade, FPsingleton) = 0.42).

We also proposed the solution on measuring similarity order using Kendal Tau between two rules set that is originally have different numbers of rules and have the relation R1 ? R2.

In the medical field, one of our finding is that Apriori produce pattern medication transition which is unusually high in frequency considering the characteristic of Kyoto Univer- sity Hospital, for example, medication transition from SU to DPP4i. Thus using Apriori mining result may leads to bias interpretation for a suggestive-type of application which lever- ages the support value ranking. However, Apriori produces a more complete medication combination possibly done by the physician. For future work, it is interesting to combine the singleton feature of full item set and the Apriori feature of not consecutive sequence. Possible application for such method is to understand better of medication evolution patterns, for example, the correlation between the start medication and later medication.
