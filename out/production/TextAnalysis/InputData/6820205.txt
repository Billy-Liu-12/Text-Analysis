ABSTRACT The utilization of e-learning is a part of teaching and learning activities for students at Universitas Siswa Bangsa International. This paper reports on an investigation into the issues and challenges from experiences of student at Faculty of education in Universitas Siswa Bangsa International using e-learning (USBI). The e-learning materials were developed particularly by the lecturers at Universitas Siswa Bangsa International. The contents were used by the lecturer in teaching courses use blended learning method.

The data were collected from 178 students that consist of 2 departments, they are English Language Teaching department and Mathematics department. The data were collected via a semi-structured survey which included open and closed-ended questions and collected in the end of semester.

Students stated that e-learning at Universitas Siswa Bangsa International can support their active participation in learning courses. It indicated that the content of the course, homework and online project is interesting and helps them to understand the whole of materials of courses. Finding in this study found that the internet connections were a big issue in conduct e-learning beside e-learning content. This study also found that the quality of e- learning was depend on the e-learning content that was prepared by lecturer.The training to develop high quality e-learning content for lecturers was become crusial and recomended to conducted before the class begin.

A common problem due to lack of attention of students during the class meeting could be overcome with propose new model of teaching methode to improve students? learning readiness in classroom. This methode was adapted from flip classroom method that give video or others multimedia suplemen that could be learned by student before the class begin.

Background One of the competences for student teacher candidate have to achieve after they graduate in this 21st century era is information and communication technology (ICT) literate. Teacher should be equipped by updating knowledge in teaching and learning that use ICT as a teaching media. As a teacher, the teacher candidtate will face that in the future their students are digital native generation who use computer, cell phone, and any of ICT gadgets as common tool in the student daily life. These students having grown up with computers and the internet are said to have a natural aptitude and high skill levels when using new technologies. (Jones, Ramanau, Cross, & Healing, 2010).

E-learning refers to the use of information technology (ICT) in different processes of education to support and enhance learning in higher education institution.(Al-adwan, 2012). Idea to use Fully E- Learning process for teaching and learning process is a great idea. However, limitation of ICT infrastructure such as internet connection, computer and human resources remains the big issue especially in developing country. Therefore teaching and learning process is proposed to be conducted in the mix of face-to-face and e-learning combination. This teaching method is known as blended learning or hybrid learning. In general blended learning could be said a combination between e-learning teaching method and face to face teaching (traditional) method. Face to face or traditional class teaching learning method will help student to discuss the difficulties they face in e-learning. All of the difficulties were solved in the class with pair discussion, group discussion or to be answered by lecturer directly.

At Universitas Siswa Bangsa International, blended learning has been applying since even semester on 2012 as learning method. Blended or hybrid learning is one of the approaches that is utilized to help students for meaningful learning via information and communication technologies in educational settings  (Ge?er, 2012). Student is encourage to have self-directed learning ability, in which student have the primary responsibility for planning, carrying out and evaluating their own learning experiences. (Caffarella & Baumgartner, 2007).

2013 IEEE 63rd Annual Conference International Council for Educational Media (ICEM)    Every lecturer creates online materials and put them on e-learning website. Some of assignment, homework and project would be uploaded on e-learning website, and students can see their score directly online. The course material is particularly designed as well by a lecturer to help student understanding. Some of material are consist of videos, photos and multimedia.

Purpose This study aims to determine the issues and challenges of students toward the use of e-learning at Universitas Siswa Bangsa International (USBI) which used blended learning.

Method A case-study design was used in this study. Participant of this study were 178 students from Mathematics and English department at Faculty of Education at Universitas Siswa Bangsa International.

The study lasted for 14 weeks, and at the end of the study, the students filled questionnaire forms and did forum group discussion (FGD) to gather data. For data collection, forms with  open ended questions and  quantitative questions was prepared then was sent to student manually written on paper form. All of data collected were used in qualitative analysis, and for quantitative analysis, the data was obtained from the forum group discussion.

Data collection and analysis One benefit of e-learning is that e-learning can give easiness in accessing due to the nature of e-learning that could be access from anywhere and anytime as long as there is internet connection.

In questionnaire form, for the question ?how often do you access e-learning ??  only 13% of students who access every day, this result depiceted that motivation of students to access of e-learning was driven by course schedule. Students did not have urgensi or need to open e-learning everyday. This result showed that 74 % of students were engaged actively in learning activity every week. This result then compared with FGD data, its revealed that students prefered blended learning method than teacher center method. It was caused by the easiness of e-learning that could be access from everywhere, easiness to access course material, and easiness of assignment submitting.

The researcher then investigated in regard to others things that distracted students when they were accesing e-learning. From the FGD, it was found that there were several things such as internet connection problem, e-learning materials that had not been updating or not well organized , lack of computer skill to use e-learning and some were caused by personal problem such as motivation, loss password and personal financial.

Figure 1. Frequency of access e-learning    2013 IEEE 63rd Annual Conference International Council for Educational Media (ICEM)     For question ?where was the place during accessing e-learning ??, the survey shows that 61% of students who accessing at campus area either using their own laptop or campus? personal computers.

This data depicted that campus is the favorite place to access e-learning. It indicate that the readiness in learning was well developed in students mind. In campus, student was ready to learn, the environment had support them to study. This phenomena was good due to campus is place to learn. In this case USBI was did the role as education institution that provide good environment for learning.

Figure 2. Location for accessing e-learning   To grasp student?s attention, the e-learning contents was enriched with multimedia materials that consists of video, ilustration or simulation. In regard to interactive learning materials, the survey found that 43% of students feel somewhat beneficial, 36% feel beneficial, 10% feel not beneficial and 12% feel highly beneficial. This result was confirmed with data from FGD session that students state that the multimedia material was not give clear understanding due to time constraint in the classroom.

Figure 3. Benefit of the delivery of multimedia     2013 IEEE 63rd Annual Conference International Council for Educational Media (ICEM)    In collaboration or group work activity, students at USBI was use online group discussion forum to comunicate with, 50% of students feel somewhat beneficial, 32.58% feel beneficial, 12.92% feel not beneficial and 4.49% feel high beneficial.

Figure 4. Benefit of student collaboration     Social media was included in learning process to engage communication betwen students. From the survey it depicted that Social networking (e.g. facebook, twitter) was used to communicate student-to- student was 42.61% of students feel beneficial, 29.55% somewhat beneficial, 19.32% feel highly beneficial and 8.52% not beneficial.

Figure 5. Benefit of social media for revision purposes: student-to-student   The result depicted that social media could increase students interest to engage learning. Online revision could help student much to correct theirs assignment immediately, students said that lecture could give feedback as soon as possible and they could did the revision at that time. It was effective and engaged them to learn more.

2013 IEEE 63rd Annual Conference International Council for Educational Media (ICEM)     Discussion Initially, the e-learning was built to facilitate students with abundant information that they could access in structurally way in learning. Students could learn and share resources at their own pace from the comfort of their own homes. At USBI, students Research into the use by lecturers of e-learning has increased our understanding of pedagogy  (Oliver, 2006). To achive all benefits of e-learning, the institution should be equiped with well infrastructure, the most important is internet connection. Lack of well internet connection could contribute in students? frustation in learning process. Due to the result of this study, a recommendation was proposed to improve capability of server, bandwidth and computer maintenance.

The foundations ? technology and the learning design - need to be of the highest quality possible.(Mitchell & Honore, 2007). Blended learning should be particularly designed with adequate preparation before it is delivered in class. The lecturer should be trained well to design interactive and effective course material. The ideal blended learning model is one that integrates a wide range of functions that empower learners with more control to participate in several formal and informal learning activities.(Baldwin-Evans, 2006). The drawback of  blended learning method was found that some student appear did not familiar with independent study, they did not seem to be working on their studies independently. There appears to be a strong reliance on the modul tutor for information and guidance.

Its better if student could be prepared before the class begin with initial video or reading materials.

Students could have initial understading on topics that they will learn in class. Lecturer could give video or others materials which burning on cd or saved in usb to overcome the lack of internet connection if they are put on e-learning.
