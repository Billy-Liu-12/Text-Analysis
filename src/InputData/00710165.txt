ABSTRACT  A. Pinsky Avionic Systems Engineering  Lahav Division Israel Ahrafi Industries Ltd  arrinsh @ hotmail.com  We have applied techniques, developed in [I], to samples of track measurements slnd have obtained decision rule that ahe asymptotidly close to decision rule characteristics (probWty of false objects generation is not greater than any given significance level, and possibdity to omit exist- ing objects d a a s a ;  with increase of observation time).

The recursive computatian algorithm that implmm ttEe above decision rnIe is developed, and objects location ex- timates are also obtained at every time step.



I. INTRODUCTION  In 111 Sensor Fusion (SF) problem of instantaneous measuremeam, received from multiple independent sensors is developed, This decision d e  assures that the probabi1- ity of fake object generation is not higher than any given significance level, while possibility to omit existing objects decreases, when mort: precise measurements are available.

More precise instantaneous measurements can be obtained only when sensor-to-object distance decreases. However, when tracks are avaiblble, similar effect can be achieved by statistical average of measurements of their non-variable parameters. In this paper invariability of track "sources" is regarded as such parameter.

The purpose of this research is to propose an algo- rithm that extends decision rule for instantaneous meas- urements to sequences of track measurements, and to ob- tain their consistency conditions. This algorithm has been developed in recursive form, namely, every current deci- sion is based on the previous one.

In the second section the general track-to-track asso- ciation problem is formulated as the classic statistid analysis problem  In the third section an example of two track associa- tion is presented.

In the forth section the main statement of the desired decision rule and object location estimates are given.

The algorithm implementing this decision d e  is pre- sented in section 5.

2. SF PROBLEM FORMULATION  Tracks received from II independent sensors can be represented as independent sequences of measumnents af some mving object locations. These independent se- quences of measurements are denoted by 2;. (k) i=Z ... n.

Every measurement, received at the k time (k =l,Z,.-.), can be represented in the following form  s;, ( k )  = Qi (k) + 6 (k) , GiW E {61(k),.-.,6,,&W , 1) E, ( k )  2 N(G,ZI, (W (2)  where Gi (k) is an actual locatian of the object at the time k, m is the unlaw~n n m k r  of the objezts, t 6 (k) 1 is the sequence of independent n o d  distributed random vectors with vector zero man and covariance matrix  The problem is to estimate m, to cluster the tracks cor- responding to the same sources, and to estimate the loca- tions of the objects at each time step.

The fact that two tracks zl (k)& (k) k =I,2, ... correspond to the same source, is equivalent to set of equations in 3 X 2 a o r m l  parame- ter space @of meal vectors G 2 ( k )  = {&1(k) ,@2(k)) ' :  B , ( k )  = G 2 ( k )  (3)  6 * ( k ) - G 2 ( k )  =a (4) or  Thus, in this case the track-to-track associatian prob- lem is eqnivalent to testing problem hypothesis about mean  0-78034449-9/98/$10,00 1998 IEEE 47 I  http://hotmail.com   Statement 1.

It is also consistent if the con- dition  vectors G 2 ( k )  = { 6 ' 1 ( k ) , 6 ~ 2 ( k ) } '  that are situated in the same linear subspace for every k =1,2, ....

Denote k(k) the following sequence of vector sample variables  k(k) = z , ( k ) - ? , ( k )  (3 where - Then k(k) is normal distributed random vector with  vector mean A(k)  and covariance matrix Z ( k ) ,  where (14) 1 -  k &k) = &k) = G , ( k ) - G , ( k ) V k )  = El (k) + L (k) (7) below).

We will introduce the following sequence of st& tics: Dekinitiim ?. Sequencea of matrix { Ak ] k =1,2F-.,  is called asymptotically sindar to matrix AI (a 4 AI) if Ak,Al EA and kePnelfA1) 2 n k m l ( A k ) .

Since the estimation (9) is unbiased, the sequence of statis- tics (11) represents the sequence of deviation estimation (9) from the parameter s ~ p x e  We will introduce the following sequence of the deci- sion rules:  ;i(k) = 6 1.

lim P(Ak / Al) + 0 (18) k--)ao  is fulfilled.

This similarity definition means that probability of false objects generation is always less than a, while con- sistency means that possibility to omit objects decreases with increasing ofahremation time.

Such sequence is repre- sented in the following the0re;m.

Theorem: Sequence of decision rules, such as every "berof  it is r e e d  by:  *(k) : (2:) " -> A,  (27) is fulfilled, the sequence is also consistent.

Proof: Proof of the first p a t  of the theorem follows from the corresponding statement [l} and the l i  b rems.

To prove the second part of the thearem it is d- c k t  to show that the condition (27) replaces the condition max(tmcdZi) + Oin [ll.

TEfE DECISION RULE ALGORITHM  Statistic (25) can be represented at every time step k in the following form (compare With. (12) in 111):  where every item can be. interpreted as p-cluster "weight" and the sum represents the "weight" of an arrangement.

Then according to the decision rule (26), for all arrange- ments, whose weights do not exceed their corresponding threshold, it has already been found an arrangement with minimum number of cIusters. Let matrix A,  -     be matrix corresponding to this arrangement- The algo- rithm works as follows:  At the time step k+Z the new ''avaxge track m u r e - ment" (19) is calculated Then ''average track measurement" covariamx matri- ces(23) zed&& NQW buiLd new arrangements (see 5.[1]) with ttte above averages* according to (3 I).
