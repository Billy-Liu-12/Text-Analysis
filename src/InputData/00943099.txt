Zimmermann Fran-ken Data STW Wurzburg  Germany Germany  SUMMARY Germany has an unique approach for the deregulation of the energy market: There is no regulation authority in place. With the new ?Hssociations? Agreement on Criteria to Determine Use of System Char es for Electric Energy?, signed on December 13? 1999, the rules for the liberalized electricity market in Germany were completely re-defined. This document replaced the existing transaction model defined in the first version of the Associations? Agreement by a point of connection model. This new model specifies that electricity customers have to buy the network access to be able to buy electricity on the free market. The new rules give a central role to distribution network operators. The new business processes coming with this market model are described in this paper and IT solutions to solve the new tasks are shown. The Implementation at the Stadtwerke Wurzburg AG is an example how to implementate an Energy Balance Management  NEW RULES ARE DEFINED  The new Associations? Agreement (AA) defines simplified methods to assign the costs for network use and the settlement of imbalances to the different market players. Network customers have the right to build so-called balancing groups.

?Balancing groups are virtual entities within which the difference between the feed-in and extraction is offset vis-a-vis the respective transmission company (TransCo).? [l]. Differences between feed-in and extraction are compensated by the TransCo. The TransCo as operator of the control area charges the balancing group manager for these differences. To avoid investment in expensive load profile meters for small customers, standard load profiles were developed.

A special role was assigned to the distribution network operator (NetCo). He owns and operates the measuring devices at the customer sides.

Therefore he is obliged to collect the meter data and provide it to the different energy supply companies (EsCo) which are active in his network area. Additionally, he has to supply the TransCo and the balancing group managers with aggregated load profiles for determination and billing of the network imbalances. 3  Due to the high amount of data, the NetCo can fulfil the new tasks only with the support of computerized tools. He has to manage the new business processes from the beginning in an efficient way.

The NetCo needs support by IT tools for the following key business processes: o Manage the contract data (network access  contracts, network use contracts, electricity supply contracts) and keep the relation meter-  ? customer-supplier updated 0 Manage a high amount of load profile data o Calculation and aggregation of synthetic or  analytic load profiles based on the standard load profiles  o Distribute aggregated load profile data to the different market participants  0 Determination of the fees for network use for all customers  0 Calculation of yearly consumption? differences after the yearly measurement for not telemetered customers  o Consider the new renewable energy law and other legal aspects.

FEES FOR NETWORK USE  The AA defines the contractual relations between the market participants (Fig. 1). The electricity customer needs three contracts: o The network access contract defines the  technical conditions for the access to the network  o With the network use contract the customer buys the right to extract electricity at his connection point  o The electricity supply contract defines the prices and conditions for delivery of electricity by the EsCo.

Today, with the vertical integrated structure of the utilities and the very small customer change rate, most electricity customers still have their old, single electricity supply contract with the EsCo who is at the same time the NetCo. If a separate EsCo gets the electricity supply contract from the customer, he will sign the first two contracts in the name of the customer with the NetCo. Therefore, he asks for a mandate. In both cases the EsCo bills the customer for the whole price of electricity delivery - energy and network use. The TransCo charges the NetCo for network access and network use.

Agreement in Germany  Some NetCo?s are not satisfied with the current situation, because they fear to loose customer contact. They want to bill the network customers themselves for network use, like it is implemented already in Norway. This means that an electricity customer gets two bills - one for the energy and one for network use.

With the fees for network use all costs of the network operators of all voltage levels are covered. This includes: 0 Network infrastructure for all voltage levels  used by the customer 0 System services like network operation, load  frequency control or?voltage regulation D Consumption of reactive power (up to  defined limit) o Network losses o Metering devices and reading 0 Concession fee to the municipalities D Costs for the handling according to the new  renewable energy law.

LOAD PROFILE PROCESSING  In the context of metering and aggregating of small customers? values, AA provides simplified methods with model load profiles in order to make it unnecessary to install expensive and costly load profile metering systems. Small customers load behavior can be described by model load profiles [2]. Generally, this model load profiles depend on the type of customer (i.e.

households, small commercials or farmers), the season (i.e. summer, winter, transition period) and day types (i.e. working days, Saturdays, Sundays). The load profiles are normalized to a yearly consumption of 1000 kWh. Dynamic functions can adapt model profiles to different parameters like temperatures etc. The NetCo can  choose between two different methods of load profile processing. .

In order to proceed according to the synthetic load profile processing, the NetCo assigns a model profile to each small customer. Since the model profiles are normalized to a yearly consumption of 1000 kWh, each profile is scaled with the customers? forecasted yearly consumption. In the next step, the NetCo collects the profiles of all customers having a contractual relationship to a supplier or trader and aggregates the profiles. He hands over these profiles to the suppliershraders. They use them to organize their energy supply.

In contrast to synthetic load profile processing, analyfic load profile processing starts from the total demand in NetCo?s network. He subtracts all load profiles metered and the network losses to get a so-called rest curve. This rest curve represents the load behavior of small customers.

NetCo split this rest curve in parts for each supplier by multiplying the rest curve with participation factors.

There are two different ways to get these participation factors: Following the simple analylic load profile processing, the NetCo sums up the forecasted yearly consumption of all customers assigned to a supplier. Thus, the participation factor for a supplier is given by the ratio between this aggregated yearly consumption and the sum of yearly consumption of all customers. This ratio remains unchanged until supplier?s composition of customers changes. Each supplier gets an analytic load profile, which shape is like the shape of the rest curve.

6.26  The simple analytic load profile processing does not consider suppliers? composition of his customer group. To overcome this shortcoming, NetCo can proceed according to the extended analytic load profile processing: In a first step, NetCo calculates a complete synthetic load profile. The participation factors for a supplier and a customer type are given by the ratio between the synthetic load profile of the customer type and the complete synthetic load profile. Thus, the supplier?s participation factors are functions of the time and can change although supplier?s composition of customer types remains the same. Because of that, the shape of supplier?s analytic profile can differ from the shape of the rest curve.

Both methods of load profile processing base on small customers? forecasted yearly consumption.

After reading of all small customers? meters, NetCo can determine the differences between the yearly consumption of all suppliers. The differences have to be settled between NetCo and suppliers.

IT SOLUTION FOR THE NETCO ,  The necessary tool to solve the ?business processes of the NetCo as mentioned above is the Energy Balance Management (EBM). It is based on Oracle and Java. Therefore, it is platform independent and scaleable to the needs of all sizes of NetCo?s. The data base contains time series values like load profiles as well as source data and contract data. This system  EsCo Balancing Groups  concept fulfils the requirements on such a solution like:  Performance  0 Scalability and flexibility Availability.

A special challenge in the implementation of an EBM is the integration into an existing IT landscape of a NetCo. Therefore, interfaces are necessary to automated meter reading systems of different vendors, to billing systems and customer care solutions (CCS). EBM imports most of the source data, e.g. customer data, via these interfaces.

Handling of high amount of data  With the new Distribution Code published in October 2000, a first set of standards is defined for protocols to be used for the communication to the market participants. ? This introduces EDIFACT as general frame for the communication architecture.

Web based solutions are also available. They allows EsCo?s and customers to collect their data themselves. Depending on contract data, access rights to the appropriate data are set automatically.

Prior to the implementation of EBM, it has to be clarified to which extend the solution should be integrated and automated. The praxis shows that many legacy systems are not able to provide the necessary interfaces and data. So as starting solution EBM is able to work independently. Only load profiles have to be made available via an interface (may be manual operated).

TransCo Network Customer  Figure 2:    6.26  It is possible to implement EBM stepwise in a NetCo. In a first step, only the customers supplied by external EsCo?s are managed with the system. When interfaces become available with the introduction of new systems, all customer data can be loaded. The migration effort for this step is minimal, because EBM is already prepared for the integrated solution.

SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION AT A MUNICIPAL UTILITY  Stadtwerke Wuerzburg AG is a municipal utility for a town with 120.000 inhabitants and supplies electricity, gas, water and district heating. In two own power stations - a stone coal and gas fired district heating power station and a waste power station - 60 % of the electricity consumption is generated.

Stadtwerke Wuerzburg AG decided in May 2000 to buy an EBM to fulfil the requirements of the new AA. As the system implementation of an EBM affects many departments in a utility, the following departments of the company were involved in the planning and the implementation of the project:  network operation (VNB)   0 sales household customers 0 commercial & billing department 0 legal department 0 IT department 0 power economics department.

district heating power station (HKW) sales industrial & commercial customers  At the start of the project some organizational and technical conditions of the project had to be defined. The organizational issues are clearly influencing human resource topics. A detailed clarification of these points is necessary before the project start, so that every department knows his duties and his rights.

Under the organizational conditions the following points have to be mentioned: 0 business processes and distribution of tasks  between the involved departments, especially VNB, HKW, Sales and also the new balancing group  0 definition of the project team and of inter- department working groups  0 decide about the incorporation of the responsible for the network fee in the company organization  0 time schedule 0 responsibilities  In the next step the departments have to describe together the technical conditions for the  project. Important for the decision on implementing a specific software product are the following topics:  functionality, system concept 0 investigation of the network use fees 0 decision about synthetic or analytic load  profile processing 0 define which customers have to be equipped  with load profile meters 0 handling of metering data (raw data).

Exchange of meter data is a very essential point for the operation of an EBM. Therefore a decision about the used meter data format is necessary. The preferred solution should be the use of the format defined in the Metering Code.

This format has four parts: 0 country code (2 characters)  postal code (5 characters) 0 20 characters as internal identifier of the  unique identifier of the network operator (6 characters)  NetCo.

While the first three bullets are clearly defined for every customer, it is the task of the NetCo to define an identifier for the fourth bullet so that the Metering Code gets a unequivocal key. Different possibilities are available: continuous number, combination of geographic data, meter number, customer-number, etc. In all cases it has to be assured that the key?s identity is not only temporary and that this numbering system also fits to the needs of the future. In some cases it may be necessary to adapt the automatic meter reading system in order to implement the new meter data format.

As described above, the integration of the EBM into the IT landscape of the company has a very important role in such a project. For Stadtwerke Wuerzburg AG there were some points of special importance: 0 standard interfaces of the used software  package (Import / Export) 0 support of the different types of  communication (Online, Offline), protocols (EDIFACT, e-mail, FTP), data formats  Format, EXCEL, ASCII) 0 quality, reliability, technology 0 data consistency within all involved systems.

(MSCONS, DELFOR, UTILMD, XML, DVG-  The goal is to integrated EBM with a degree as high as possible into the IT landscape of the company. Reasons for this are: 0 most of the data needed in EBM is already  available in existing systems -> avoid multiple data entry and data maintenance    6.26  the network operation department has no own billing system -> the calculation of network use fees can be done in EBM and the prepared billing data are send to the billing department known data base structure -> In the past Stadtwerke Wuerzburg AG gained good experience with the FrankenDataWareHouse and knowledge in the data model, which help a lot to do a better and faster integration of EBM  EBM is based on Oracle and Java and therefore can be handled easily.

using standard software ->  It doesn?t make much sense to start with a complete integrated system from the beginning.

Implementing the EBM stepwise gives advantages in getting the system running fast. It is possible to start with a basic system only for the customers of external EsCo?s and by using manual interfaces. This way of implementation gives the chance to gain experience and knowledge in the handling of the system. With this approach it is possible to define the common data interfaces between the involved systems with the feedback from the praxis.

The result of the described project implementation can be summed up as follows: 0 it is necessary to define a clear separation in  organization and staff for the tasks concerned with the project  0 installation of a large data base system is necessary  0 the interfaces of the EBM for import and export of data are very important  0 the most important experience: -> the problems appears in the details!

CONCLUSION  The concept of balancing groups and load profile processing is clear and straightforward.

However, the NetCo needs a computer based energy balance management system (EBM) to handle the great amount of data, up to several hundreds of Gigabyte, and to distribute results to the relevant market participants. Special software techniques are necessary to get a flexible, scalable and performant solution.

The example of a EBM implementation gives an idea about the difficulties and challenges a utility is faced with during the project. EBM is an inter department application and has to be handled as such from the beginning. This require also appropriate management support within the utility.
