Mining Both Positive and Negative Weighted  Association Rules with Multiple Minimum Supports

Abstract?Association rule mining is an important model in data mining. Many mining algorithms discover all item associations (or rules) in the data that satisfy the user-specified minimum support and minimum confidence constraints. The weights are associated with the items to solve the question of different importance of the items. But there is another case that the frequency of every item is different from each other. Traditional single support threshold can?t mine association rules effectively.

In this paper, the efficient mining of multiple-level association rule is proposed to resolve the above question. This method can not only discover associations that span different hierarchy levels but also have high potential to produce rare but informative item rules. Moreover, an algorithm for mining positive and the negative weighted association rules based on multiple minimum supports is designed simultaneously.

I.  INTRODUCTION Association Rule is an important type of knowledge  representation revealing implicit relationships among the items present in large number of transactions. Association rule mining (ARM) is firstly proposed by R.Agrawal, T.Imielinski and A.Swam in 1993[1]. An algorithm of mining rules put forward in 1994[2][3]. All the items in a database are treated in a uniform in the traditional Algorithm Apriori. But the items are different from each other because of the concern of the users. Generally, the users pay more attention to the items that is profitable. If an item is interesting for the decision-maker, then it is set a high weight. The model of weighted association rule and corresponding algorithm is proposed by C. H. Cai et al.[4]. An efficient mining method for Weighted Association Rules (WAR) is put forward [5].

The minimum support is the key element that makes association rule mining more practical. It is used to prune the search space and to limit the number of rules generated.

Traditional algorithm of mining association rule is based upon the single minimum support on condition that the items in the data have the same frequency. But there is another case in real application that the frequency of every item is different from each other. In the case, if the user-specified minimum support is too high, then the items with low frequency of appearance can?t be mined. Otherwise, if the user-specified minimum  support is too low, then combination explosion may occur. We adopt multiple minimum support thresholds. The technique allows the user to specify multiple minimum supports to reflect the natures of the items and their varied frequencies in the database. Liu et al. proposed am approach for mining association rules with non-uniform minimum support values in [6]. Wang et al. proposed a mining method, which allowed the mining support value of an item to be a function of minimum support valves of items constrained in the itemset [7]. Two efficient algorithms, called MMS_Cumulate and MMS_Stratify, were designed in [8]. In this paper, the method of multiple minimum supports is applied to weighted association rules.

Negative association rules (NARs) mining has received much attention recently. Sometimes the decision-makers are concerned with the patterns that are low frequent but correlated strongly to reduce the negative influence that the disadvantageous factors bring on. The rules of the form A??B, which suggests that a customer may not buy item B after the customer buys item A, together with the rules of the forms ?A?B and ?A??B, are called negative association rules and the rules of the form A?B positive association rules (PARs) [9]. The problem of identifying negative associations (or ?dissociations?), addressing also the absence of item sets, has been explored and considered relevant [10][11].

We extend the existing association rule model to allow the user to specify multiple minimum supports to reflect different natures and/or frequencies of items. Specifically, the user can specify a different minimum item support for each item. At the same time, an algorithm for mining the positive and negative weighted association rules with multiple minimum supports (WPNMS) is proposed. Experiment shows that the algorithm is effective.



II. PROBLEM STATEMENT AND RELATED WORK  A. Formulation of Weighted Association Rules Weighted Association Rules is as follows: there are n  records and m items. Let I ={i1,i2,....,im}be a set of items and W={w1, w2,?, wm}(wi? [0,1]?be the set of non-negative real numbers. A pair(X, w(X)) is called a weighted item where X?I is an item and w(X)?W is the weight associated with X. A  This work was partly supported by Young Scientist Foundation of Shandong Province China (2006BS01017) and Nature Science Foundation of Shandong Province China (Y2007G25)   DOI 10.1109/CSSE.2008.997     transaction is a set of weighted items, each of which may appear in multiple transactions with different weights. A dataset may therefore be defined as a set D of transactions.

Given a weighted itemset X and a set of transactions, referred to as D, we say X has support in D if s% of transactions in D support X. The weighted support of an itemset X in a dataset D, denoted as  wsup(X) = countD(X)/|D|*w(X)   (1)  where countD(X) is the number of transactions in D containing X. Note that the support of a weighted itemset X is always less than or equal to the support of any of its generalization.

There are several different formulations for the weighted support of the rule X?Y according to the different demand, where X?I, Y?I, and X?Y=?. In this paper the following form is used:  wsup(X?Y) = avg{ w1, w2,?, wp } ? sup(X?Y)        (2)  where p is the items? count of the itemset X, avg{ w1, w2,?, wp } is the average value of the weight of itemset X?Y and sup(X?Y) is support of itemset X?Y before the item is associated with weight.

The confidence of the WAR denoted as wconf is the ratio of the weighted support of X*Y over the weighted support of X.

B. Calculate Measures of Weighted Negative Association Rules There are very few papers to discuss and discover negative  association rules. Brin et.al[12] mentioned for the first time in the literature the notion of negative relationships. In [13], each positive rule X?Y correspond three negative ones, X??Y, ?X?Y and ?X??Y. A transaction t supports X??Y if X ?t and Y?t.

In [14], the authors proposed a simple but efficient method to calculate the support and confidence of NARs through positive association rules?. In [15], the correlation is applied to the weighted association rules model to mining the positive and negative association rules.

C. Definition of Correlation Measure Some problems such as self-contradictory rules may occur  when studying both the positive and negative association rules.

Therefore another parameter is added to eliminate these misleading rules, many kinds of measure are proposed, such as correlation. The definition of the correlation is as follows:  corrA,B= ( ) ( ) ( )  w su p A B w su p A w su p B  ?   (3)  There are three possible cases for the values of the correlation corrA,B: if corrA,B=1, then the two variables are independent. When corrA,B >1 the two variables considered are perfectly positive correlated. Similarly, when corrA,B<1, the variables considered are perfectly negative correlated.

Moreover, there are such relationships between the four forms: if corrA,B >1, then corrA,?B <1, corr?A,B <1, corr?A, ?B>1 and vice versa.



III. ALGORITHM DESIGN  A. Definition of Multiple Minimum Supports In multiple-support model, every item has different support  constraint.

Any item ij of the itemset I={i1,i2,....,im} is predefined a minimum support value, called minimum support of item, denoted as smin(ij).

Definition 1 The minimum weighted support for an itemset X(?I) is set as the minimum of minimum support of the items contained in the itemset, denoted as smin_itemset(X).

Definition 2 An itemset X is said to be weighted-frequent (large) if its weighted support is larger than a user-specified value of the itemset (also called minimum weighted support (wminsup(X))).

B. A Proposed Algorithm for Mining Weighted Association Rules with Multiple Level The task of mining association rules is usually decomposed  into two steps:  ? Itemset generation: find all large itemsets that have support exceeding a threshold minimum support.

? Rule construction: from the set of large itemsets, construct all association rules that have a confidence exceeding a threshold minimum confidence.

The frequent items are generated by the method of level- wise search. The Apriori closure property is no longer in point, when every item is associated with weight. Therefore, the k- Support Bound of itemset is calculated in the pruning process.

The proposed algorithm first finds all the large 1-itemsets L1 for the given transactions by comparing the support of each item with its predefined minimum support. Then, calculate all the 1-itemsets, and put the items whose weighted support is larger than predefined minimum support and the itemset whose k-Support Bound (function ksb()) is less than its support count into C1. After that, candidate 2-itemsets C2 can be formed from C1. The frequent k-1-itemset is joined with itself to generate candidate k-itemset when k>2.

The most common framework in the association rules generation is the ?support-confidence? one. Although these two parameters allow the pruning of many associations that are discovered in data, there are cases when many uninteresting even self-contrary rules may be produced especially when both positive and negative association rules are mined simultaneous. The correlation measure is added to the framework to eliminate the self-contrary rules.

C.  Algorithm Description The main procedure of Algorithm WPNMS:  Input L: T: transaction database; wminsup[ ]: minimum weighted supports;wminconf: minimum weighted confidence     Output PAR: set of positive associate rule; NAR: set of negative associate rule;  Steps:  1. The set of items in database is denoted as A. scan database T, calculated the weighted support of every item. L1 ={c?A| wsup(c)?wminsup[0] } and C1={c? A| wsup(c)<wminsup[0] ? ksb(c)<c.count}.

2. Generate candidates C2 by joining C1 with itself.

3. Generate L2 according to the results in Step 2. L2 = {c?C2| wsup(c)?wminsup[1] },C2={c? C2 | wsup(c)<wminsup[0] ? ksb(c)<c.count}.

4. Generate candidates C3 and C2.

5. Repeat Steps 2-4 for new candidates Ck={c? Ck | wsup(c)<wminsupitem(c) ? ksb(c)<c.count}, large itemsets Lk={c?Ck| wsup(c)?wminsupitem(c) }, until no large k-itemsets created, where the result of the function wminsupitem(Ck) is the smallest predefined minimum support value of item in the c.



IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS  A. Comparison of Frequent Itemsets Number with PNWAR Table 1 is a transactions database. The weights are listed  according to user?s interestingness:  A:0.4, B:0.8,C:0.9,D:0.4,E:0.6.

TABLE I.  TRANSACTIONS DATABASE                        The given minimum support of item is as follows: A:0.04, B:0.16, C:0.09, D:0.12, E:0.24. Compared with the algorithm PNWAR [15], the experiment result is shown in Table 2.

Min, avg and max denoted the minimum, average, maximum value of the given minimum support of items respectively. The experiment demonstrated that the algorithm can not only avoid generating a large number of rules when the minimum weighted support is too low but also avoid wining no rules when the minimum weighted support is too high.

TABLE II.  NUMBER OF FREQUENT ITEMSETS AND RULES GENERATED BY TWO ALGORITHMS   PNWAR(single-level)  WPNMS min avg max  The number of frequent itemsets 16 9 4 12  The number of positive rules 32 8 0 20  The number of negative rules 34 8 0 20    B. Changes of Positive Association Rules Number We conducted our experiments on a man-made dataset to  study the behavior of the algorithms compared. The dataset had 10000 transactions, when only the 10 largest categories were kept. We compare with traditional Algorithm Apriori based on single-level (DWARMMS) and an algorithm based on the multiple minimum supports (WPNMS), where the minimum support items are set the equal value. The result was reported as follows:  TABLE III.  CHANGES OF POSITIVE ASSOCIATION RULES NUMBER  WPNMS DWARMMS  PARs 835 3256  NARs 4886    The data shows that the number of positive rules decreases sharply. Therefore, algorithm WPNMS can efficiently prune the self-contrary rules in the multiple-level model.



V. CONCLUSIONS The measure support is important in mining weighted  negative association rules. As single minimum support is insufficient in negative association rule mining, this paper proposes an algorithm WPNMS based on multiple-level. The model allows the user to specify multiple minimum item supports. The algorithm can prune the misleading rules for decision-maker. The experiment shows that the algorithm is effective.
