Quantitative Association Rules Mining Methods with Privacy-preserving

Abstract  Considering the different size of quantitative  attribute values and categorical attribute values in  databases, we present two quantitative association  rules mining methods with privacy-preserving  respectively, one bases on Boolean association rules,  which is suitable for the smaller size of quantitative  attribute values and categorical attribute values in  databases; the other one bases on partially  transforming measures, which is suitable for the larger  ones. To each approach, the privacy and accuracy are  analyzed, and the correctness and feasibility are  proven by experiments.

1. Introduction  R.Agrawal et al. proposed the importance of  privacy-preserving in data mining and the method of  privacy-preserving in 2000 [1]  . In 2002, S.J.Rizvi et al.

discussed the privacy-preserving of association rules  mining problem in paper[2,3].The privacy-preserving  in Boolean association rules mining was resolved in  paper[3], but the privacy-preserving in quantitative  association rules mining was not discussed. In practical  application, the attributes are mainly quantitative or  categorical, and Boolean attributes can be considered  as a special case of categorical attributes.

2. Privacy-preserving of Quantitative  Association Rules Mining Methods Based  on Boolean Association Rules  In this approach, we first define a transform function  for quantitative attributes and categorical attributes.

Then all the quantitative attributes and categorical  attributes in the original dataset are mapped into 0 or 1  to get a Boolean dataset. Last we handle this Boolean  dataset to do mining, using the privacy-preserving  method of Boolean association rules provided by  S.J.Rizvi.

Obtaining the Boolean values, We use the mining  method of Boolean association rules presented by  MASK in paper[3]. We generate the distorted vector by  computing Y= distort (X) where Yi Xi XOR i r  ,  ir is the complement of ri, a random variable with  density function f(r) = Bernoulli (p) (0 p 1). That is ,  ri is valued of 1 with probability p and 0 with  probability 1-p.The experiments indicate that it is  possible to simultaneously achieve satisfactory of  privacy and accuracy through a careful choice of  distortion probability. In particular, they shows that  both of the two goals can be met in the condition of  p=0.9.

3.The Privacy-preserving Method of  Quantitative attributes and Categorical  attributes  When thinking over how to partition the quantitative  attributes into intervals and how to determine the  number of the intervals, we make the decision of  intervals? partition of the least information loss base on  partial completeness [4]  .

3.1 Determining the number of Partitions  Theorem 3.1 Consider a quantitative attribute x, and  some real K>1. Assume we partition x into intervals  (called base intervals) such that for any base interval B,  either the support of B is less than minsup (K-1)/2 or  B consists of a single value. Let P denote the set of all  combinations of base intervals that have minimum  support. Then P is K-complete respected to the set of  all ranges over x with minimum support [4]  .

Theorem 3.1 defines the maximum support of the  base intervals. Let s be the max support of an interval,  according to the Theorem 3.1, we can get s=minsup  (K-1)/2, thus  K=1+2 s/minsup                  (1)  At the same time, we discuss the effect of K upon  privacy. Privacy should be defined as the probability  we can not reconstruct the true values from the interval  values, which is the complement of the reconstruction  probability. The formula is P=1- K  , K>1.

Because equip-depth partitioning minimizes the  number of intervals required to satisfy that partial  completeness level [5]  . Assuming that equip-depth  partitioning splits the support identically, there should  be 1/s partitions in order to get the support of each  partition being less than s. Thus we get  Number of intervals= )1(   ?? Km  Where m is the minimum support, K is the partial  completeness level.

3.2 Partially Transform Measure  Partially Transform 1 Let Y=n-X+1, where Y is the  transformed integer values, X is the original integer  values, n=max (X).

Partially Transform 2 Let n=max(X), when n is an  even number, m= ?? ?  ?? ? +   1 n , if X<m, Y=X+m-1, if X m,  Y=X-m+1; When n is an odd number, m=  1 n+ , if X  m, Y=X+m-1, if X>m, Y=X-m. Where X Y is the  same as the definition of Partially Transform 1.

Partially Transform 3 Let Y=X-x, x=1?n, if Y 0,  then Y=X Y[n], where X Y is the same as the  definition of Partially Transform 1, n=max(X), Y[n]  denotes the n th  Y.

Partially Transform 4 Using the matrix operation  to change the original data values. The transform  process is shown as follows.

[ ]  nnn a  a  a  n  ?  ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  ?  ...00  ...........

0...0  0...0  ,...2,1   = [ ]nrrr ,..., 21 ,  where ri is one member of the set {1,?n} and ri ? rj., ai is the transform variable.

4. Algorithm Based on Partially Transform  Algorithm: Finding frequent predicate sets     Input: Database D, attribute sets U={u1,u2,?un},  Array A[1,?n] (storing the number of intervals of  different attributes), min_sup  Output: L, frequent predicate sets in D.

Method:  1)L[1]  2)For i=1 to n do {  T[i]  For j=1 to A[i] do  T[i] T[i] {1-frequent  predicate sets of the j th  interval of attribute uj };  L[1] L[1] {T[i]}  }  3) i 2;  4) while L[i-1]   do {  C[i] aprioriGen (L[i-1],min_sup);  P ;  For each  r D  do P P subset(C[i], r);  L[i] ;  For each  p P  do  if (support_count of p min_sup) then  L[i] L[i] {p};  i i+1};  5) k i-2;  6) Return (L[k])  6.Conclusion  In this paper we analyzed the privacy-preserving of  quantitative association rules mining, presented  privacy-preserving methods based on Boolean  association rules and the partially transform measure.
