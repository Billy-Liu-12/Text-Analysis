Abstract? Presently educational institutions compile and store  huge volumes of data such as student enrolment and attendance  records, as well as their examination results. Mining such data  yields stimulating information that serves its handlers well.

Rapid growth in educational data points to the fact that distilling  massive amounts of data requires a more sophisticated set of  algorithms. This issue led to the emergence of the field of  Educational Data Mining (EDM). Traditional data mining  algorithms cannot be directly applied to educational problems, as  they may have a specific objective and function. This implies that  a preprocessing algorithm has to be enforced first and only then  some specific data mining methods can be applied to the  problems. One such preprocessing algorithm in EDM is  Clustering. Many studies on EDM have focused on the  application of various data mining algorithms to educational  attributes. Therefore, this paper provides over three decades long  (1983-2016) systematic literature review on clustering algorithm  and its applicability and usability in the context of EDM. Future  insights are outlined based on the literature reviewed, and  avenues for further research are identified.

I. INTRODUCTION  S an interdisciplinary field of study, Educational Data  Mining (EDM) applies machine-learning, statistics, Data  Mining (DM), psycho-pedagogy, information retrieval,  cognitive psychology, and recommender systems methods and  techniques to various educational data sets so as to resolve  educational issues [1]. The International Educational Data  Mining Society [2] defines EDM as ?an emerging discipline,  concerned with developing methods for exploring the unique  types of data that come from educational settings, and using  those methods to better understand students, and the settings  which they learn in? (p. 601). EDM is concerned with  analyzing data generated in an educational setup using  disparate systems. Its aim is to develop models to improve   This paper was submitted on 07-Dec-2016 and was accepted on 24-Dec-2016.

While DM,  also referred to as Knowledge Discovery in Databases  (KDDs), is a known field of study in life sciences and  commerce, yet, the application of DM to educational context  is limited [3].

One of the pre-processing algorithms of EDM is known as  Clustering. It is an unsupervised approach for analyzing data  in statistics, machine learning, pattern recognition, DM, and  bioinformatics. It refers to collecting similar objects together  to form a group or cluster. Each cluster contains objects that  are similar to each other but dissimilar to the objects of other  groups. This approach when applied to analyze the dataset  derived from educational system is termed as Educational  Data Clustering (EDC). An educational institution  environment broadly involves three types of actors namely  teacher, student and the environment. Interaction between  these three actors generates voluminous data that can  systematically be clustered to mine invaluable information.

Data clustering enables academicians to predict student  performance, associate learning styles of different learner  types and their behaviors and collectively improve upon  institutional performance. Researchers, in the past have  conducted studies on educational datasets and have been able  to cluster students based on academic performance in  examinations [4,5].

Various methods have been proposed, applied and tested in  the field of EDM. It is argued that these generic methods or  algorithms are not suitable to be applied to this emerging  discipline. It is proposed that EDM methods must be different  from the standard DM methods due to the hierarchical and  non-independent nature of educational data [6]. Educational  institutions are increasingly being held accountable for the  academic success of their students [7]. Notable research in  student retention and attrition rates has been conducted by  Luan [8]. For instance, Lin [9] applied predictive modeling  technique to enhance student retention efforts. There exist  various software?s like Weka, Rapid Miner, etc. that apply a  combination of DM algorithms to help researchers and  stakeholders find answers to specific problems.

The e-commerce websites use recommender systems to collect  user browsing data to recommend similar products.  There  have been efforts to apply the same strategy in the educational  information system. One such successful system is the degree  compass. [10] a course recommendation system developed by  Austin Peay State University, Tennessee. It uses predictive  analytical algorithms based on grade and enrollment data to  rank courses. Such courses if taken by the student helps them  excel through their program of study.

This is our contribution. Future insights are outlined  based on the literature reviewed, and avenues for further  research are identified.

Finally Section VII provides the conclusion.



II. EDUCATIONAL DATA MINING (EDM)  The EDM process converts raw data coming from educational  systems into useful information that could potentially have a  greater impact on educational research and practice? [1].

Traditionally, researchers applied DM methods like clustering,  classification, association rule mining, and text mining to  educational context [11]. A survey conducted in 2007,  provided a comprehensive resource of papers published  between 1995 and 2005 on EDM by Romero & Ventura [12].

This survey covers the application of DM from traditional  educational institutions to web-based learning management  system and intelligently adaptive educational hypermedia  systems.

In another prominent EDM survey by Pe?a-Ayala [13], about  240 EDM sample works published between 2010 and 2013  were analyzed. One of the key findings of this survey was that  most of the EDM research works focused on three kinds of  educational systems, namely, educational tasks, methods, and  algorithms.  Application of DM techniques to study on-line  courses was suggested by Za?ane & Luo [14]. They proposed a  non-parametric clustering technique to mine offline web  activity data of learners. Application of association rules and  clustering to support collaborative filtering for the  development of more sensitive and effective e-learning  systems was studied by Za?ane [15]. The researchers Baker,  Corbett & Wagner [16] conducted a case study and used  prediction methods in scientific study to game the interactive  learning environment by exploiting the properties of the  system rather than learning the system. Similarly, Brusilovsky  & Peylo [17] provided tools that can be used to support EDM.

In their study Beck & Woolf [18] showed how EDM  prediction methods can be used to develop student models. It  must be noted that student modeling is an emerging research  discipline in the field of EDM [6]. While another group of  researchers, Garcia at al [19] devised a toolkit that operates  within the course management systems and is able to provide  extracted mined information to non-expert users. DM  techniques have been used to create dynamic learning  exercises based on students? progress through English  language instruction course by Wang & Liao [20]. Although  most of the e-learning systems utilized by educational  institutions are used to post or access course materials, they do  not provide educators with  necessary tools that could  thoroughly track and evaluate all the activities performed by  their learners to evaluate the effectiveness of the course and  learning process [21].



III. CLUSTERING ALGORITHMS  Clustering simply means collecting and presenting similar data  items. But what defines similarity? That is the key to  understanding ?clustering?. A cluster is therefore a group of  items that are similar to each other within the group and  dissimilar to objects belonging to other clusters. In statistical  notation, ?clustering is the most important unsupervised  learning algorithm? [22]. Being a pre-processing algorithm in  the data mining process, clustering can significantly reduce the  data size to meaningful clusters that can be used for further  data analysis. However, one must be careful when reducing  the data size because when representing data in the form of  fewer clusters typically loses certain fine details similar to  lossy data compression.

The classification of clustering algorithms is imprecise  because several of them overlap with each other. In traditional  terms, clustering techniques have broadly been classified into  two types, hierarchical and partitional. But before we discuss  these types it?s important to understand the subtle difference  between clustering (the unsupervised classification) and  supervised classification (or discriminant analysis). In  supervised classification, we are given a collection of labelled  (or pre-classified) data patterns. The objective is to determine  the labeling for a newly encountered unlabeled dataset.

Whereas, in the case of clustering the problem is to group the  unlabeled dataset into meaningful categorical labeled patterns  or clusters.

When classifying clustering methods, on the one hand, the  nature of the clustering method has to be considered. Thus,  concerning the structure of clusters that form the clustering  solution (one-layer or several layers of clusters), Partitional  and Hierarchical methods are usually distinguished.

Furthermore, the distinction between Hard and Soft methods,  which is referred to how the objects in the dataset are mapped  onto the clusters (binary mapping vs. degree of belonging), is  very relevant as well.

While, clustering methods are typically classified according to  the approach adopted to implement the algorithm: Centroid-  based clustering, Graph-based clustering, Grid-based  clustering, Density-based clustering, neural networks-based  clustering, and etc. Thus, one can find algorithms that  implement Partitional/Hierarchical and hard/soft methods  within each and every of these approaches.

Thus, considering these definitions, we can find, for instance:  K-means/Fuzzy c-means, which are the most typical examples  of centroid-based hard/soft partitional clustering algorithm,  respectively; Single Link (SLINK) or nearest neighbor is a  popular graph-based hard hierarchical clustering algorithm; or  Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise  (DBSCAN), is a density-based hard partitional clustering  algorithm.

Citation information: DOI 10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2654247, IEEE Access  > REPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR PAPER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (DOUBLE-CLICK HERE TO EDIT) < 3  Continuing further, only geometric hierarchical methods (e.g.

Ward?s method) consider the existence of cluster centroids  when implementing the linkage function, but graph  hierarchical methods (such as Single-Link and Complete-  Link) are not based on centroids, or any other kind of center-  based approach to clustering. Divisive clustering is the other  type of hierarchical algorithm. It?s the ?top-down? approach in  which initially all the data points are in one big cluster and  splits are performed recursively as the algorithm moves down  the hierarchy. Further details on these algorithms can be found  in the work of Jain & Dubes [23].

Clustering algorithms are also applied to voluminous data  sizes such as big data. The concept of big data refers to  voluminous, enormous quantities of data both in digital and  physical formats that can be stored in miscellaneous  repositories such as records of students? tests or examinations  as well as bookkeeping records by Sagiroglu & Sinanc  [24].

A data set whose computational size exceeds the processing  limit of the software, can be categorized as big data as  proposed by Manyika et at [25]. Several studies have been  conducted in the past that provide detailed insights into the  application of traditional data mining algorithms like  clustering, prediction, and association to tame the sheer  voluminous power of big data by Zaiane & Luo [14]. Broadly,  educational system can be classified as two types; brick or  mortar based traditional classrooms and digital virtual  classrooms better known as  Learning Management Systems  (LMSs), web-based adaptive hypermedia systems [26] and  intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) [6].



IV. LITERATURE SEARCH PROCEDURE AND CRITERIA  Since this is a review paper so it becomes important to outline  the literature search criteria and the underlying process  involved. This study followed Kitchenham, et al. [27]  methodological guidelines for conducting a systematic  literature review. The research question for this study is to  agglomerate the application of clustering algorithms to  educational data. The major steps for conducting the literature  search are as follows;  A. Constructing Search Terms  The following details will help in defining the search terms  that we used for our research question. Educational attributes:  learning styles, exam failure, classroom decoration,  annotation, exam scheduling or timetabling, e-learning,  learning outcome, learning objectives, student seating  arrangement, student motivation, student profiling, intelligent  tutoring systems (ITS), semantic web in education, classroom  learning, collaborative learning, education affordability.

Clustering algorithms: broadly classified as partition,  hierarchical, density, grid type, hard and soft clustering. An  example of research question containing the above detail is:  [How is K-means applied to] CLUSTERING ALGORITHM  [learning styles of student] Educational attribute.

B. Search Strategy  We constructed the search terms by identifying the  educational attribute and clustering algorithm. We also  searched for alternative synonyms, keywords. We used  Boolean operators like AND, OR, NOT in our search strings.

Five databases were used to search and filter out the relevant  papers. The five databases are given in Table I.

Citation information: DOI 10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2654247, IEEE Access  > REPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR PAPER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (DOUBLE-CLICK HERE TO EDIT) < 4  The planned selection process for this study had two parts: an  initial selection of published papers that could plausibly  satisfy the search strings or the selection criteria based on  reading the title, abstract and keywords followed by the final  selection based on the initially selected list of papers on  reading the full text of the paper. The selection process was  performed by the primary reviewer. However, to mitigate the  primary reviewer?s bias if any an inter-rater reliability test was  performed in which a secondary reviewer confirmed the  primary reviewers result by randomly selecting the set of  primary sources (i.e. 15 articles). We have identified 166  articles as our final selection for this review process that are  shown in Tables I and II, respectively.

The total research paper  count is 166. The papers cited in table II, III, IV, V and VI are  from five databases, namely, IEEEXplore, ACM Digital,  JEDM, ProQuest Educational Journal and Science Direct. The  search criteria are shown in section IV. Also as shown in table  III, it is interesting to note that the maximum number of  papers (more than 10) have been published in categories  (EDM, e-learning and learning styles), while fewer than five  papers have been published in categories (Annotation,  classroom decoration, concept clustering, education  affordability, exam failure, exam scheduling, Intelligent  Tutoring System?s (ITS), self-organizing map, semantic web  in education, student motivation, student profiling and  classroom learning). These areas provide the scope for  improvement as well as areas for future research.

We have clustered various research works that have been  conducted exclusively within educational attributes related to  clustering algorithms and is shown in Table III.

A. Analyzing Student Motivation, Attitude and Behavior  More often, students weak in mathematics would dread the  mere notion of being asked by the teacher to sit in the front  seat. Some common adages suggest that the back-benchers in  a classroom are typically slow learners as compared to those  who sit in the front seats. Students? seat selection in a  classroom or lab environment and its implications on  assessment was measured by Ivancevic, Celikovic & Lukovic  [50]. K-means clustering was applied to an electronic log of  4096 records featuring information on student login/logout  actions according to the time table of class meetings. After  clustering, it was found that students with high levels of  spatial deployment (seat selection) have 10% higher  assessment scores as compared to students with low spatial  choice.

Students typically write in the margins of books about their  understanding of the text presented. This activity is called as  'annotation'. In one of a kind study proposed by Ying, et al.

[64] two simple biology inspired approaches of chromosome  behavior was applied to 40 students? annotations text. Then,  they clustered the data based on the similarity between  annotations using K-means clustering and hierarchical  clustering methods. They found that their proposed  approaches are more efficient than the generic hierarchical  clustering algorithms.

Buehl & Alexander [135] studied students? epistemological  beliefs about knowledge acquisition and their learning  process. The objective of this research was to examine  epistemological beliefs and students? achievement motivation.

The unique aspect of this study is that rather than examining  whether or not individual beliefs are related or co-related to  performance and motivation; the authors tested different  configurations of beliefs that were related to students?  competence beliefs, achievement values and text-based  learning. The sample size was 482 undergraduate students  whose beliefs on knowledge, competency levels, and  achievement values in history and mathematics were analyzed.

Ward's minimum variance hierarchical clustering technique  was used to analyze the data. The results revealed that students  with different epistemological beliefs vary with their  competency beliefs and achievement values. They suggested  that future research may apply cluster analysis to different  configurations of beliefs related to various aspects of student  learning.

In a similar study a survey was conducted using Self  Deterministic Theory (SDT) to measure student motivation  towards learning and achievement by Dillon & Stolk [140].

The survey participants were 404 engineering students. The  participant group consisted of 93 students in project-based  material science course of an engineering college, 137  students in lecture-lab materials science course of a liberal arts  university, and 174 students in lecture and lecture-lab course  from a public University. Their data set comprised of 1278  complete survey responses and MCLUST method was applied  to the data set. The results revealed situation-based motivation  among engineering students but this motivation type could not  be classified under the traditional intrinsic/extrinsic categories.

Exactly like behavioural scientist who study their subjects?  behaviour in order to understand them better, in a similar  analogy the EDM scientist measure the behaviour of learners  to design effective improvement solutions.

Yet, the  aforementioned studies indicate that there are other similar  areas that need to be explored and mined for the benefit of  leaners, educators, and policy makers.

B. Understanding Learning Style  In 1971, David Kolb presented his infamous learning style  theory called as ?Experiential Learning Theory (ELT)? [141].

The term ?Experiential? means drawing knowledge based on  previous experiences. In the same year, he also presented his  Learning Style Inventory (LSI), a model used to assess  differences in how individuals learn. Since then there have  been various types of learning style inventories and learning  theories. Some notable contributions are John Dewey?s model  of learning, as well as Piaget?s model of learning and  cognitive development. These learning style theories not only  helped educators and researchers of the yesteryears but they  continued to exert influence up to the present time.

Many studies reported the usage of learning styles in teaching  to improve education quality Felder & Spurlin [142], Hawk &  Shah [143]. Nowadays, learning style theories are used in an  educational environment to enhance learning abilities of  learners as well as teaching skills of educators. Looking at  Table III, we notice that most publications are in e-learning.

This indicates that considerable research work has been  carried out in this field. It is obvious because the stage was  already set, that is to say, the e-learning environment for the  end-user was ready, the infrastructure in the form of internet  was already in place and the database that held user activity  was replete with data waiting to be mined by data scientists.

However, little if any, research has been carried out on  understanding learning styles of a learner in a spatial  (classroom) environment using data mining methods such as  clustering. ?Can easy accessibility to course material improve  student learning or foster teaching in an e-learning  environment?? is an interesting research question. In the  following, we present notable research works that have  contributed to answer this question.

A survey conducted at Warsaw School of Economics, where  every semester more than 2000 students attend online lectures,  showed that there are no significant improvements in student  grades as compared to traditional classroom environment by  Zajac [144]. This ground-breaking study stimulates another  pertinent question, ?What factor is responsible for directly  affecting learning and teaching so as to make or mar a  learner?s performance? The answer is in personalization of the  learning content and individual?s learning preferences, a  fundamental factor in teaching and pedagogy. Every  individual has his own learning preference as suggested by  Felder [145]. Measuring individual?s learning preferences is  easy but how do we measure the learning preferences of all  students in a class or semester? Fortunately, there exist  mechanisms tailored for this specific purpose, aptly, called as  Learning Style Inventories (LSIs). There are various types of  LSIs available and the most acclaimed is Kolb?s LSI [141].

In this paper, we aim to highlight research works that have  applied clustering in various aspects of learning, therefore, we  will not provide detailed discourse on LSI and it makes more  sense to discuss clustering or any other data mining method as  applied to LSI to improve learning. In this study by Rashid, et  al. [125], where they applied statistical methods to determine  LS based on human brain signals. The primary purpose of this  study was to classify the participants? learning styles (LSs). A  unique aspect of this study was analyzing the LS of the learner  with psychoanalysis test using Mind Peak's Wave Rider  instrument and brain signal processing. The effects of  cognitive style on student learning in a Web Based Instruction  (WBI) program using decision tree and K-means clustering  method was studied by Chen, Chen & Liu [41] to  automatically create student groups in a Computer Supported  Collaborative Learning (CSCL) by considering individual  learning styles as studied by Costaguta & de los Angeles  Menini [146].

Much has been discussed so far regarding LS in critical  reference to many of its attributes. But one imperative  question remained unanswered and that is, ?How do you  identify learning style of an individual?? This is best answered  by Ahmad & Tasir [147]. As can be seen, most of the research  works have focused on e-learning because of easy  accessibility to data.  This is in spite of the fact that there are  several areas within learning styles as outlined above such as  personalization of learning, learning style identification, and  application of LSI in teaching that require further research,  especially, in relation to data mining.

C. E-Learning  Perhaps the most notable research in the context of EDM has  been done in reference to e-Learning. One of the reasons is the  easy availability of data to analyse and infer from. In their  paper Pardos, et al. [91] used a two-step analysis approach  based on agglomerative hierarchical clustering to identify  different participation profiles of learners in an online  environment. Different levels of learner participation were  measured by the number of posts, replies to the posts,  frequency of threads posted, depth of the threads posted etc.

Agglomerative Hierarchical clustering was used for this  purpose. Data sets were adapted from online discussion  forums of three different subjects in a virtual  Telecommunications Degree (Electronic Circuits, Linear  Systems Theory and Mathematics) over the period of three  semesters (from February 2009 to July 2010). Thus, the whole  data set involved a total amount of 672 learners distributed in  eighteen different virtual classrooms and a total amount of  3842 posts. Total withdrawal and passing rates were 36.31%  and 52.23%, respectively.

In another study conducted by Eranki & Moudgalya [37], 82  students from three engineering colleges were observed and  K-means clustering was applied to their e-Learning data to  investigate the influence of human characteristics on users?  preferences while using WBeI. The sample size was 82 (51  male & 31 females). Then, Systematic Usability Scale (SUS)  questionnaire was administered to the participants so that their  perceptions on the use of Spoken tutorial interface could be  identified. The SUS questionnaire was a 20.5 point Likert  scaled questionnaire that was adapted to predict cognitive and  affective data. By applying K-means clustering, the authors  were able to find that expert computer users favoured multi-  page, dynamic buttons and drop-down menus while the novice    2169-3536 (c) 2016 IEEE.

In Table IV, we show the research papers that have  been published in clustering in e-learning sorted by the type of  clustering algorithm used.

TABLE IV  RESEARCH PAPERS PUBLISHED IN CLUSTERING IN E-LEARNING  E-learning & Clustering Published Papers  Non-Hierarchical  Algorithm  K-means [34], [37], [38], [30], [41], [106], [110], [32]  C-means [38]  Fuzzy K-means [73], [38]  K-prototypes [148]  Fuzzy Clustering [33], [32]  Hierarchical type  algorithm  Agglomerative Clustering [36], [31],[35]  Markov Clustering [39]  Discrete Markov Model (DMM) [30]    Research conducted by [104], discusses  problem-solving  behavior, different types of behavioral patterns of learners,  and how these patterns can be automatically discovered. The  purpose of applying this approach was to detect patterns based  on targeted and automated clustering of users? problem-  solving sequences as represented by Discrete Markov Models  (DMMs). Data was taken from Andes Physics course of the  USNA (2007-2009) from PSLC Data shop. The novelty of this  research is that clustering has been applied at three different  behavioral patterns. Level 1 (pattern driven), uses established  predefined problem-solving styles and aims at discovering  these patterns in student behavior. After clustering was  performed on the data set of 8 clusters, two clusters with Trial  and Error problem-solving style were identified. At level II  (dimension-driven), the system tries to identify the given  dimension and then helps in discovering the concrete styles  along with these dimensions. Level III (open discovery), aims  at the automatic discovery of both learning and dimensional  style. A fundamental importance of this work is the  employment of a set of optimization metrics that are applied  on the achieved clusters to determine if the optimum cluster  setting has been reached.

D. Collaborative Learning  Research on collaborative learning in an e-learning  environment with students with mild disabilities was  conducted by Chu, et al. [148]. It initially began with a focus  on individuals in a group, later the focus shifted on the group  itself and as the study progressed it was found that comparing  the collaborative work with individual learning was more  effective amongst the group participants. In a situation where  a categorical variable has multi values the K-prototypes model  as proposed by Huang [149] cannot be used. Therefore, one of  the unique contributions of this study was that it proposed an  enhanced clustering algorithm that used the K-prototypes  model to cluster data with numerical, categorical single-values  and categorical multi-values. Based on this clustering  algorithm the researchers created context & content maps for  creating their case-based reasoning recommendation system  with semantic capabilities. This adaptive reasoning model  enhanced teacher?s practical knowledge and helped them to  solve the student's learning problems. Collaboration is ?the  mutual engagement of participants? in a coordinated effort to  solve a problem together? as suggested by Dillenbourg, et al.

[150]. There have been various research works that have  studied different variables pertaining to collaboration such as  group size, composition of the group, communication channels  within the group, interaction between peers and reward system  in group work [150,151,152,153]. It has been argued that in  order to understand and estimate the collaboration process,  understanding the concept of collaborative learning is crucial  by M?hlenbrock & Hoppe [154]. In this section, we will  present and discuss research works that have implemented  clustering algorithms to determine collaborative learning.

It is a learning method that requires learners to work together  in groups or teams to reach a predetermined goal. It develops  the abilities for interaction, fosters team building, enables  sharing and cooperation and focusses on the collective  perspective towards problem solving skills amongst learners  within the group. As discussed in section 4.2, every student  has a unique learning style. Chang, et al. [155] used Item  Response Theory (IRT) to determine the students? ability and  applied K-means clustering to group students together. This  helped the teachers to adapt learning materials and teaching  programs according to the student ability and aptitude. The  experimental results showed that the average learning ability  in the experimental group improved from 3.84 to 5.97. On the  contrary, the learning ability in the control group only  improved from 2.16 to 2.4.

One of the problems associated with this type of learning is  that learners are not able to receive the appropriate support  level from their collaborators. Anaya & Boticario [43] in their  study found that clustering algorithms when applied to such  data, build clusters according to learners? collaboration. So,  active collaborators learn more in e-learning environment.

Earlier related works have tackled this issue in different ways.

Some researchers have looked at student collaboration from  the perspective of experts evaluating collaborators? learning.

Most other researchers approached it from collaborative  information perspective. This information is then given to the  learner/educator for their use. The novelty of this research is  that by applying data mining methods, the researchers were  able to recognize active and passive collaborators while  learners were interacting with each other. The researchers used  Expectation-Maximization (EM) clustering algorithm and  Weka as their first step to build a data set. In this step, a data    2169-3536 (c) 2016 IEEE.

Over 100 students? data was derived from UNED  European universities? largest online course using the dotLRN  [156] platform. The number of students who took part in their  research was 260 in 2006/2007 and 239 in 2007/2008.

Examples of statistical indicators of learners were the number  of threads posted or started by the learners, the average or the  square variance etc. They were able to prove that highly active  collaborators benefit more and their activities induce others  too.

Learning in groups promotes learning motivation which  increases student participation in learning activities and fosters  good learning performance. In most cases, teachers would  typically group students according to their grades. As such,  students with poor grades may feel left-out. In an investigative  study conducted by Perera, et al. [60], the objective was to  improve teaching group work skills, facilitate effective team  work by small groups, and work on substantial projects over  several weeks by exploiting the electronic traces of group  activity. For this purpose, K-means clustering was used along  with WEKA and Euclidean distance measure. The data size of  43 students working in seven groups from TRAC [61] was  1.6MB in MYSQL format containing approximately 15,000  events. Also, EM clustering algorithm was used from Weka.

Their cluster size for both K-means and EM was 3 clusters  with 11 attributes and they obtained the same results, thus,  proving that the choice of their attributes was good and  without flaws because K-means is very sensitive to cluster  sizes and also does not deal well with clusters with non-  spherical shape and different sizes.

E. Educational Data Mining using Clustering  As we know that clustering algorithms can broadly be divided  into hierarchical and non-hierarchical types. So, it would be  easier if the research conducted could equally be partitioned  according to the clustering algorithm used. This is shown in  Table V following which we present a discussion on some of  these works.

TABLE V  RESEARCH PAPERS PUBLISHED IN CLUSTERING IN EDUCATIONAL DATA  Educational data & Clustering Published Papers  Non-Hierarchical Algorithm K-means [157], [158], [87], [90], [159]  C-means [47],  Co-operative  Particle Swarm  Optimizer (PSO)  [94]  Farthest First [46]  Expectation  Maximization (EM)  [160]  Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm Agglomerative  Clustering  [59], [161]    Wook, et al. [46] have evaluated undergraduate students?  academic performance on end of semester exam. They applied  a combination of data mining methods such as Artificial  Neural Network (ANN), Farthest-First method based on K-  means clustering and Decision Tree as a classification  approach. The data set comes from the faculty of science and  defense technology, National Defense University of Malaysia  (NUDM). Zheng and Jia, worked to improve the existing K-  means clustering algorithm that has several drawbacks; In  [157] they have stated that first, it is sensitive to the choice of  the initial cluster centroids and may converge to the local  optima; Second, the number of clusters needs to be determined  in advance; and third, high dimensional data clustering takes a  long time to finish. Co-operative Particle Swarm Optimizer  (PSO) technique which is an improved version of K-means  clustering is proposed by these researchers.

In an analytical study conducted by Parack, et al. [158] the  applications of various DM techniques to student academic  data has been provided. In this study, Apriori algorithm was  applied to academic records of students to obtain the best  association rules which help in student profiling. K-means  clustering was used to group students categorically. The data is  obtained from student academic record file; however, there is  no mention of specific academic database being used. In this  study by Zhiming & Xiaoli [81] worked on to identify the  significant variables that affect and influence the performance  of undergraduate students. The C-Means clustering method  was used. But there is no mention of the data set used in the  study. In another analytical study a group of researchers  Zheng, et al. [30] attempted to cluster high dimensional  educational data in this study. When traditional K-means,  clustering is applied there is a huge computation cost involved,  Therefore, to eliminate it, a new model is proposed that uses  the Co-operative Particle Swarm Optimizer (PSO) frame to K-  means clustering to reduce computation cost caused by K-  means. (PSO) technique which is an improved version of K-  means clustering is proposed.

In Fig. 1, we show the educational data clustering process. The  first stage is the data pre-processing stage in which the  researcher must first understand the domain and complexity of  the educational dataset collected thereafter should be able to  identify the attributes that have garbage or missing values. By  garbage values we refer to values that are not marked to be  present for the attribute.

Let us take an example, consider a nominal attribute  ?student_response? with allowed values like ?yes? or ?no?.

Fig. 1. Educational Data Clustering process    There should also be defined a standard to fill missing values.

So, for example, referring to the above attribute  ?student_response? the missing values could be filled as ???.

This activity is termed as data standardization. Once the data is  cleaned, it should then be analyzed. Perhaps the easiest way is  to determine relationships between various attributes that  constitute the dataset. For example, Weka uses various  machine learning algorithms (like Correlation attribute  evaluator, One R attribute evaluator, gain ratio attribute  evaluator, Principle component analysis attribute evaluator)  that can easily determine the most significant attributes within  the dataset. Once such significant attributes are found they can  then be used to train and cluster the whole dataset to create  data models. Post which new data having same or similar  attributes can be applied to these data models to reveal  interesting insights.

Chi, et al. [162] have conducted a study to determine student  profiles based on their online browsing habits. The objectives  of this research were two-fold. In the first step, they used  content based filtering to extract keywords to obtain an  article?s characteristic descriptions. In the second step,  Hierarchical K-means clustering was applied to this bag of  keywords obtained in the first step. Web-pages were classified  and then the researchers applied collaborative filtering to  recommend web-pages. The research data consisted of viewing  history of the web-pages over 30 days in ten computer labs.

The number of pages viewed in 30 days was 42633 with 19  clusters.

Learning portfolios are records that are created during the  learning process. Note taking, assignments, test paper reports,  test papers etc. are examples of learning portfolio. In their  analytical paper Chen, et al. [51] applied K-means, Farthest  First and EM clustering algorithms and statistical t-test to the  student portfolios of an e-learning system. Using clustering  methods in this study they were able to cluster students? e-  learning performance. Using t-test they were able to evaluate  mid-term and final term exam performance of the clusters with  high & low online learning frequency. 162 subjects used in this  study were junior students of the department of computer  engineering at Chung Yuan Christian University. This data  was taken from i-learning [52] eLearning software being used  in Taiwan. Their tests found that there was a positive  correlation between students with high online eLearning  frequency and higher scores. It was also found that the student  portfolio of click times and duration of the study of learning  materials at the beginning of the semester does not show any  correlation with midterm and final term exam results. They  also found that student participation in online discussion  forums showed significant effect on their exam results.

In a similar analytical work conducted by Perera, et al. [60], K-  means & EM clustering algorithms from WEKA was used to  find group similarities. In this study their experiments revealed  the same result for k=3 for K-means. Hierarchical  agglomerative clustering with Euclidean distance was used for  this purpose. The student teams were required to use TRAC  [61] for online collaboration. TRAC is an open source,  professional soft-ware development tracking system. The  researchers collected the data over three semesters, for student  cohorts in 2005 and 2006. The data size was 1.6 Mbytes in  mySQL format and it contained approximately 15,000 events.

The key contribution of this research is improved  understandings of how to use data mining to build mirroring  tools that can help small long-term teams improve their group  work skills.



VI. DISCUSSION AND OPEN PROBLEM  So far, we see that subject specific research has been done but  what about domain specific? For instance, how do institutions  employ or apply data mining methods to improve institutional  effectiveness? Zimmerman?s educational model states that  maintaining and monitoring students? academic record is an  essential activity of an educational institutions. Anupama &  Vijayalakshmi [86] applied classification and prediction  algorithms, namely, decision table and One R algorithms on  students? academic record from a previous semester to predict  their performance in the current semester.

An educational institution maintains and stores various types  of student data, it can range from student academic data to  their personal records like parents? income, qualification and  etc. In a research study by Tie, et al. [163] has proved that  students performance can be predicted using a data set  consisting of students? gender, parental education, their  financial background. Chi, et al. [162] used Bayesian networks  to predict student learning outcome based on attributes such as  attendance, performance in class tests, assignments in this  study. The researchers Knauf, et al. [165] have used the  educational history of students for student modeling. While  Dimokas, et al. [164] applied data mining methods like  dimensional modeling into educational institutions be it a data  warehousing solutions as applied in the department of  Informatics of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,  storyboarding, or decision trees. While others like Nasiri,  Minaei & Vafaei [166] used regression analysis and  classification (CS5.0 algorithm which is a type of decision  tree) to predict the academic dismissal of students and the  GPA of graduated students in e-learning center. Considerable  work has been done in e-learning. Perhaps the obvious reason  is the easy availability of data. As this review indicates most of  the e-learning software?s are typically Moodle based. Also, if  Table II is analyzed closely, it is noticed that there are certain  areas like learner annotation, classroom decoration, learning  outcome, exam failure, and examination scheduling/time-  Understanding educational data set  Data  Pre- Processing Stage  Data preparation & cleaning  Data Standardi- -zation Stage  Cluster identification  Cluster Modeling Stage  Cluster evaluation & validity  Deployment    2169-3536 (c) 2016 IEEE.

This article has been accepted for publication in a future issue of this journal, but has not been fully edited. Content may change prior to final publication.

One may argue  that there is considerable literature on learning outcome or  student modeling, no doubt there is but research work on  examination failure and clustering is scarce and this caveat  which is aptly shown in Table II requires to be filled.

Organizing data into groups is a natural choice which we learn  quite early in kindergarten. Similarly, organizing data into  groups is predominant in many scientific fields. While  numerous clustering algorithms have been published and new  ones continue to proliferate; there has not been a single  clustering algorithm till now that could dominate all others. In  an education system, different users would interpret the same  data differently for example, students, educators, school  administrators, parents, and counsellors may hold various  perspectives on examination report card data and each may be  interested in generating different partitions or clusters from the  same data set. Therefore, the viability of seeking a unified  clustering algorithm would not be plausible. A clustering  algorithm that satisfies the requirements of one user group may  not satisfy the requirements of another user group. Given the  inherent difficulty of understanding and applying clustering  algorithm by a novice computer user, semi-supervised  clustering techniques need to be developed in which the  labeled data and paired constraints (user given) are applied to  represent data and choose the appropriate function for  educational data clustering. As shown in Table III little to  almost negligible research has been conducted in areas such as  learner annotation, effect of classroom decoration to augment  learning and teaching, implications of education affordability,  the inclusion of semantic web in education-its usability, learner  motivation, timetabling, examination scheduling, student  profiling and intelligent tutor systems. These are just a few of  the many attributes that still require detailed research to be  conducted from the computational perspective.



VII. CONCLUSION  This paper has presented over three decade?s systematic review  on clustering algorithm and its applicability and usability in the  context of EDM. This paper has also outlined several future  insights on educational data clustering based on the existing  literatures reviewed, and further avenues for further research  are identified. In summary, the key advantage of the  application of clustering algorithm to data analysis is that it  provides relatively an unambiguous schema of learning style  of students given a number of variables like time spent on  completing learning tasks, learning in groups, learner behavior  in class, classroom decoration and student motivation towards  learning. Clustering can provide pertinent insights to variables  that are relevant in separating the clusters. Educational data is  typically multi-level hierarchical and non-independent in  nature, as suggested by Baker & Yacef [6] therefore a  researcher must carefully choose the clustering algorithm that  justifies the research question to obtain valid and reliable  results.
