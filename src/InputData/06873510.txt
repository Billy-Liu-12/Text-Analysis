Abstract? The tensor product, denoted by ? (Kronecker  Product), may be applied in different contexts to vectors, matrices, tensors, vector spaces, algebras etc. The element (block)-wise inverse Jacket (BIJM) is simply calculated for big data which we called big data ?Fork? matrix. We use matrix decomposition method to compress or minimize the big matrix to smaller matrix. In this paper, based on the BIJM, a unified fast hybrid diagonal block-wise transform (FHDBT) algorithm is proposed. A new fast diagonal block matrix decomposition is made by the matrix product of successively lower order diagonal Jacket matrix and Hadamard matrix. The FHDBT, which is able to convert a newly developed discrete cosine transform (DCT)-II, discrete sine transform (DST)-II, discrete Fourier transform (DFT), and Haar-based wavelet transform (HWT). Comparing with pre-existing DCT-II, DST-II, DFT, and HWT, it is shown that the proposed FHDBT exhibits less the complexity as its matrix size gets larger. From the numerical experiments, it is shown that a better performance can be achieved by the use of DCT/DST-II compression scheme compared with the DCT-II only compression method.

Index Terms? Diagonal block (element)-wise inverse Jacket matrix (BIJM), Hadamard matrix, Kronecker product.



I. INTRODUCTION OW-a-days Big Data has become a promising area to do the research. As of 2012, limits on the size of data sets  that are feasible to process in a reasonable amount of time were on the order of exabytes of data. Researchers frequently encounter limitations due to large data sets in many areas, including meteorology, genomics, connectomics, and biological and environmental research. The limitations also affect Internet search, finance and business informatics. The world's technological per-capita capacity to store information has roughly doubled every 40 months since the 1980s; as of 2012, every day 2.5 exabytes (2.5?1018) of data were created.

Therefore, the challenge for large enterprises is determining who should own big data initiatives that straddle the entire organization. The BIJM is simply calculated for big data which we called big data ?Fork? matrix. We use matrix  This work was supported by the MEST 2012-002521, NRF, Korea.

The more detailed example, applications are BPSK, QPSK, 8PSK, Alamouti MIMO schemes, the MIMO LTE downlink Alamouti: non-binary BIJM. The DFT element- wise Inverse Jacket matrix: precoding, the element-wise inverse diagonal weighted Jacket matrices for closed loop MIMO precoding: 4 antennas, 8 antennas, and the Fast DST- II/DCT-II/DFT/Wavelet hybrid transform based on BIJM. The last decade based on orthogonal transform has been seen a quiet revolution in digital video technology such as moving picture experts group (MPEG)-4, H.264, and high efficiency video coding (HEVC) [1]?[5]. The discrete cosine transform (DCT)-II is popular compression structures for MPEG-4, H.264, and HEVC, and is accepted as the best suboptimal transformation since its performance is very close to that of the statistically optimal Karhunen-Loeve transform (KLT) [1]-[5].

Practical considerations, such as underlying the H.264- advanced video coding (AVC) intra mode, dictate the transform coding implementation within a block coder with a typical block of size up to 16 ? 16. However, since a DCT- based block coder suffers from blocking effect, i.e., a disturbing discontinuity at the block boundaries, much research effort has been leveraged to reduce the blocking effect. The discrete signal processing based on the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is popular in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) wireless mobile communication systems [3] such as 3rd generation partnership project long-term evolution (3GPP-LTE), mobile worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX), international mobile telecommunications-advanced (IMT-Advanced) as well as wireless local area network (WLAN). In addition, wireless personal area network (WPAN), and broadcasting related applications (digital audio broadcasting (DAB), digital video broadcasting (DVB), digital multimedia broadcasting (DMB) are based on DFT. Furthermore, the Haar-based wavelet transform (HWT) is also very useful in the joint photographic experts group committee in 2000 (JPEG-2000) standard [2], [6].

Definition: Let { },N i ja?J  be a matrix, then it is called the  Jacket matrix when ( ){ }11 ,1 TN i jaN ?? =J . That is, the inverse of  the Jacket matrix can be determined by its element-wise inverse [7], [8], [9].

Big Data ?Fork?: Tensor Product for DCT-II/ DST-II/ DFT/HWT  Moon Ho Lee, Md. Hashem Ali Khan  N      mm14-067    Proposition: With the use of the Kronecker product and Hadamard matrices, a higher order block-wise inverse Jacket matrix (BIJM) can be recursively obtained by  2 2 , 2N N N= ? ?J J H                                 (1) then  2 2  1 T N NN  ? =J J                                        (2)  where the lowest order Hadamard matrix is defined by   1 1 1 1  ? ? ? ??? ?  ?H .

Proof:  Eq. (2) holds for 2N = 8. Now we assume that the BIJM  NJ satisfies (2), i.e., 2 T  N N N N  =J J I . Since  2 2 T  N N =J J  ( )( ) ( ) ( )2 2 2 2T T TN N N N? ? = ?J H J H J J H H 222 N N  = ?I I  2NN= I , this proposition is proved by mathematical induction  that (4) holds for all 2N . If 1N = , certainly 2 2 2T =J J I .

Thus, different applications require different types of  unitary matrices and their decompositions. From this reason, in this paper we will propose a unified hybrid algorithm which can be used in the mentioned several applications in different purposes. We propose the diagonal sparse matrix factorization for a unified hybrid algorithm based on the properties of the Jacket matrix [7], [8], [9] and the decomposition of the sparse matrix. It has been shown that this matrix decomposition is useful in developing the fast algorithms and characters [9].

Individual DCT-II [1]?[3], DST-II [4], [10], [12], DFT [4], [10], [11], and HWT [6] matrices can be decomposed to one orthogonal character matrix and a corresponding special sparse matrix.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in Section II proposed hybrid for fast computations of DCT-II, DST-II, DFT and HWT matrices. In Section III, we introduce hybrid fast algorithm. Numerical simulations are presented in Section IV and the conclusion is given in Section V.



II. PROPOSED HYBRID FOR FAST COMPUTATIONS OF DCT-II, DST-II, DFT AND HWT MATRICES  We have derived recursive formulas for DCT-II, DST-II, DFT, and HWT [16]. The derived results show that DCT-II, DST-II, DFT, and HWT matrices can be unified by using a similar sparse matrix decomposition algorithm, which is based on the block-wise Jacket matrix and diagonal recursive architecture with different characters. The conventional method is only converted from DFT to DCT-II, DST-II, and DWT. But our proposed method can be universally switching from DCT-II to DST-II, DFT and HWT. Let us motivate to develop universal hybrid architecture via switching mode selection. Moreover, the butterfly data flow graphs have  2log N  stages. We can generate Fig. 1 according to the following proposed ways:  A. From DCT-II to DST-II  The N-point DCT-II of ( ){ }x n  is given by     2 (2 1) 2( ) ( ) cos  1 , 0 where , 0,1,..., 1, and  1/ 2 , 0.

N DCT N m m N  n  m  m nX m c x n c C N N N  m m n N c  m  ??  =  + = =  ???= ? = ? =??  ? x   (3) The N-point DST-II of ( ){ }x n is given by    2 ( 1)(2 1) 2( ) ( )sin  1 , 1 where , 0,1,..., 1, and  1/ 2 , 1.

N DST N m m N  n  m  m nX m s x n s S N N N  m N m n N s  m N  ??  =  + + = =  ? ???= ? = ? = ???  ? x   (4) Let NC   and NS  be orthogonal  N N?   DCT-II and DST-II  matrices, respectively. Tx x x N= ?x [ ( ) ( ) ... ( )]0 1 1  denotes the column vector for the data sequence ( ){ }x n .

Substituting , , ,...,m N k k N= ? ? =1 1 2  into (3), we have  N  N N k n  n N kC N k c x n N N  k N  ?? ?  =  + ? ? ? ? =  = ?  ? ( )( )  ( ) ( ) cos ,  , , ,...,    2 2 1 11  0 1 2 1   (5) Using the following trigonometric identity  n  n n k N  n n k N  n n k N  n k N  ? ?  ? ?  ? ?  ?  + + +? ? ?? ?  ? ? + + +? ? ? ?  = +? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?  + + +? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?  + +? ? = ? ? ?  ? ?  ( ) ( )( ) cos  ( ) ( )( ) cos cos  ( ) ( )( ) sin sin  ( )( ) ( ) sin  2 1 2 1 1 2 2  2 1 2 1 1 2 2  2 1 2 1 1 2 2  2 1 11  (6)  (5)  becomes N n  N N k n  n kC N k c x n N N  ?? ?  =  + + ? ? = ??  ( )( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) sin    2 2 1 11 1    (7) where ( )NC N k? ?1  represents the reflected version of  ( )NC k  and this can be achieved by multiplying the reversed  identity matrix NI  to NC . Equation (7) can be represented in a more compact matrix multiplication form [12]:  N N N N N N N N= ? =IS C M C I S M                  (8)    mm14-067    where, N N? ?= ?? ?/2 2M M I , and ? ?  = ? ??? ?  1 0 0 1  M  Then, the DST-II matrix is resulted from the DCT-II matrix.

Note that compatibility property exists in the DCT-II and DST-II.

B. From DCT-II & DST-II to DFT We develop a relation for the circular convolution  operation in the discrete cosine and sine transform domains.

We need to measure half of the total coefficients. The main advantage of a proposed new relation is that the input sequences to be convolved need not be symmetrical or asymmetrical. Thus, the transform coefficients can be either symmetric or asymmetric [17].

From (3) and (4), it changes to coefficient for circular convolution (C) format. Thus, we see this equation as below:  ( ) ( )   2 1 ( ) 2 cos , 0,1, , 1,   N DCT IIC N  n  m n m x n m N  N  ? ?  =  +? ? = ?? ?  ? ? ?X ? ?  and  ( ) ( )   2 1 ( ) 2 sin , 1, , .

N DST IIC N  n  m n m x n m N  N  ? ?  =  +? ? =? ?  ? ? ?X ? ?  (9)  We can write DFT as follows:  ( ) ( )  2 /   , 0,1,......, 1 N  j mn N  n  m x n e m N? ?  ?  =  = = ??X .     (10)  Now multiplying (10) by /2 j m Ne ?? , we can get    ( ) ( )  ( )  ( ) ( )  ( )  ( )  ( )  / / 2 /   / 2 /  2 11     2 2    2 1 cos  2 .

2 1  sin  N j m N j m N j mn N  n N  j m N j mn N  n m nN j  N  n  N  n  e m e x n e  x n e e  x n e  m n N  x n m n  j N  ? ? ?  ? ?  ?  ?  ?  ? ? ? ?  = ?  ? ?  =  +? ?? ? ? ? ? ?  =  ?  =  =  =  =  ? ?+? ? ? ?? ? ? ?? ?= ? ?+? ?? ?? ? ?? ?? ?? ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  X  (11)  Comparing the first term of (9) with the first one of (11), it  can be seen that ( ) ( )   2 1 2 cos  N  n  m n x n  N ??  =  ? ?+? ? ? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?  ? is decimated and asymmetrically extended of (9) with index 0 : 1m N= ? .

Similarly, ( ) ( )   2 1 2 sin  N  n  m n x n  N ??  =  ? ?+? ? ? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?  ?  is decimated and symmetrically extended of (9) with index 1:m N= . The circular convolution of cosine and sine periodic sequences in time/spatial domain is equivalent to the multiplication in the DFT domain. Then, the DFT matrix is resulted from the DCT- II and DST-II matrix.

C. From DCT-II to HWT In this subsection, if a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is  discretely sampled, it becomes the two point discrete Fourier transform, where we allow to use ? and 1 in the matrix and its inverse. The orthogonal matrix has 1/ 2  in both. The DCT,  DST and DFT based matrix is 1 1 1 1  ? ? ? ??? ?  , otherwise the HWT  becomes the Haar matrix as 1 11 1 12  ? ? ? ??? ?  .

Haar matrix,    1/ 2 1/ 2 1 11 1 121/ 2 1/ 2  r r r r  ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?  = = =? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?? ?? ? ? ? ? ? ?? ?? ?  L B  (13)  where L is low pass and B is high pass band, we can have  [ ]2 T T  T T T T  ? ?? ? ? ? = =? ?? ? ? ?? ? ? ?? ?  L LL LB L B I  B BL BB .                  (14)  Note that the [ ]2I matrix in (12) and (14) has been well matched to the propose based Jacket-Hadamard matrix. Thus, after multiplying the diagonal N N?  matrix, the HWT can be obtained as  /2 /2 /2 /2  /2 /2 /2 /2  N N N HWT N  N N N N  r? ? ? ? = ? ?? ? ? ?  ? ? ? ??? I 0 I I  M I 0 H I -I?  .     (15)

III. HYBRID FAST ALGORITHM Based on the above conversions from the proposed  decomposition of DCT-II, we can form a hybrid fast algorithm that can cover DCT-II, DST-II, DFT, and HWT. The general block diagram of the proposed hybrid fast algorithm is shown in Fig. 1. The common basis function of  [ ] 1 12 21/2 1 12 2  h h  hN h h  ? ?  ?  ? ?  ? ? ? ? ?  ?? ?? ?  I I I  I I is multiplied by the sequence with  different transforms as like as bracket ( )( )( )( )? . The requiring computational complexity of individual DCT-II, DST-II, DFT, and HWT is summarized in Table I and Table II. We show a complexity comparison among the proposed decomposition and other methods in Table I-II. It can be seen in Fig. 2 that the proposed hybrid algorithm scheme requires much less computational complexity in addition and multiplication compared to Wang?s [12], Chen?s [13] and Andrews and Caspari?s result [15].  Addition, compared to these transforms, the proposed hybrid fast algorithm can be efficiently extensible to larger transform sizes due to its diagonal block-wise inverse operation of recursive structure. Moreover, the proposed hybrid structure is easily extended to cover different applications.

For example, a base station wireless communication terminal delivers a compressed version of multimedia data via wireless communications network. Either DCT-II or DST-II can be used   in compressed multimedia data as block diagonal can significantly reduce its complexity coming from its simple structure [9, 18], depending on the variance of the original multimedia source. The DCT image coding can be easily implement in the proposed hybrid structure as shown in Fig.

1(b). If the DCT-II is multiplied by N N NI C M , then we get  DST. If the DCT/DST-II is convolved in time/frequency domain and multiplied by /2 j m Ne ?? , then it can be obtained the DFT. Finally, if the DCT is multiplied by  /2 /2 /2 /2  /2 /2 /2 /2  N N N N  N N N N  r? ? ? ? ? ?? ? ? ?  ? ? ? ??? I 0 I I  I 0 H I -I?  , then we get HWT.

Thus, the proposed hybrid algorithm enables the terminal to adapt to different transforms efficiently.

IV. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS As shown in [19], the coding performance of DST  outperforms DCT at high correlation values ( ? ), and it is very close to that of the KLT. The interesting points are that the basis vectors of DCT maximize their energy distribution at both ends, hence the discontinuity appears at block boundaries due to quantization effects. However, since the basis vectors of DST minimizes their energy distribution at other end, DST    mm14-067    provides smooth transition between neighboring blocks.

Therefore, the proposed hybrid transform coding scheme provides consistent reconstruction and preserves more details, as shown in Fig. 3 with a size of 512 512? and 8 bits quantization.

Now consider a N N?  block of pixels, X,  containing , i,j=1,2,...,N,i jx . We can write 2-D transformation  of the k-th block X as  and  TS S k C C kY T QX Q Y T X= = .

Depending on the availability of boundary values (in top-  boundary and left-boundary) in images, the hybrid coding scheme accomplishes the 2-D transform of a block pixels in two sequential 1-D transforms separately performed on rows and columns. Therefore, the choice of the 1-D transform for each direction is dependent on the corresponding prediction boundary condition.

? Vertical transform (for each column vector): employ  DST if top boundary is used for prediction; otherwise  use DCT.

? Horizontal transform (for each row vector): employ  DST if left boundary is used for prediction; otherwise use DCT.

Fig. 3 Image Coding Results showing DCT-II only and jointly optimized DCT/DST-II compression  What we have observed from numerical experiments is that the combined scheme over DCT-II performs better only in perceptual clarity as well as PSNR.  Jointly optimized spatial prediction and block transform (see Fig. 3 (e) and (f)) using DCT/DST-II (PSNR 35.12dB) compression outperforms DCT-II (PSNR 32.38dB) compression only. Less blocky artifacts are revealed compared to that of DCT-II (24dB).

Without a priori knowledge of boundary condition, DCT-II performs better than any other block transforms coding. The worst result is obtained by using only DST-II.



V. CONCLUSION Now-a-days Big Data has become a promising area to do  the research. This product is also referred to as outer product.

The term "tensor product" is also used in relation to monoidal categories. In this paper, we have derived a unified fast hybrid diagonal block-wise transform based on Jacket-Hadamard matrix. Therefore, the complexity of the proposed unified hybrid algorithm is much less as its matrix size gets larger.

Jointly optimized DCT/DST-II compression scheme reveals a better performance (about 3dB) over the DCT only compression method.
