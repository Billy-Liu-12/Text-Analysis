Extraction of Academic Social Network from Online  Database

Abstract?There has been quite a number of research efforts in extracting academic social network from on-line open sources such as the DBLP, ACM DL and IEEXplore. Extraction of such a network is usually based on the concept of co-occurrences. One of the issues in such efforts is actually involved extracting reliable and trusted network particularly when dealing with the heterogeneity of features in the Web. In this paper we demonstrate the use of association rule to enhance existing superficial method for extracting social network from online database such as the DBLP. The approach proposed has shown the capacity to extract social relation as well as the strength of these relations.

I. INTRODUCTION Extracting academic social networks aims at making the  comprehensive possibility in this research field. The academic social networks are about interests of academic persons in mostly there are in online database, as DBLP, ACM, IEEE, et.

Semantically their information is homogenous and be an assistance of developing basic concept for extracting social networks from another documents as information sources. In the semantic web area, some researchers identified actors and their relations using superficial approach for extracting social network [1, 3, 4, 5], some of them are about academic social networks [4, 5].

This paper identifies the strength relations and labels of network based on the concept of tree in graph theory, by involving some information retrieval strategies: TF.IDF, and similarity measures. This paper exploits data of DBLP and co- occurrence as a nucleus of semantic relation. Therefore, the main objective is to address social network using expanded superficial method relying on the association rule.



II. RELATED WORK Generally, to build any network, the first step is to  determine nodes [6, 7]. Discretely, a node v ? V in a graph G, is a representation of any object in a network, i.e., V = {vi|i = 1,?,n}, V = ?. The nodes in a social network refer to actor names such as authors, recipients, researchers, artists,  politicians, firms, organization, or any entities, whereby, A = {ai|i = 1,?,n} [8].  Therefore, the first task of extracting social network is to identify the actors. This can be achieved by providing a list of names as seeds in order to extract other names, recognize and disambiguate them [9, 10]. We denote the first task as ?. Each actor plays some role in a social network based on his/her background. In many situations, these are considered as attributes or characteristic [11, 12]. Formally, such characteristics can be defined as Z = {zj|j = 1,?,m} which are attributes/characteristics of entities whereby a pair of <A,Z> is the instance of actors, where Zi are subsets of Z, Zi are subsets of attributes of each entity ai, i.e., <ai,Zi>, i = 1,?,n, or simply denotes a set of attributes of entity a as Za.

For determining an edge in any network based on a concept of graph theory [6], we need to define what the relation is.

Specifically in the case of social network, the edges refer to relationships between actors [7]. Therefore, another main objective of extracting social network is to identify relations among entities. We denote this task as ?. An edge e ? E discretely in a graph G, is a representation of relations among two actors a, b ? A [8]. Precisely, there exists R as a set of possible relations between social actors, e.g., R = {r1,?,rk}, where R : A ? A?A = R(a,b), for all a,b in A. In other words, the relations among actors are formed by sharing attributes, ideas, and concepts between them, which can be depicted as the intersection between their attributes [13], or defined as:  rk(a,b) = Za?Zb    (1)  In social network extractions, ? and ? are exertions to further acquire rich and trusted social network. Formally, the social networks can be defined as:  SN = <V,E,A,R,Z,?,?>, V = ?, A = ?   (2)  that satisfies the following conditions: (a) ?(1:1) : A ?V, v = ?(a),  for every a in A there is only one v in V; (b) ? : R ? E so that ej = ?(rk(a,b)) = ?(Za?Zb), ej ? E, rk ? R, for all a,b in A, where Za, Zb, Za?Zb are subsets of Z.

There are two research streams exist in extracting social network from various sources of information, i.e. the unsupervised method [14, 1, 2, 4, 7, 15, 16, 17, 18] and the supervised method [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]. The unsupervised method utilizes the Cartesian product for clustering the nodes  28-29 June 2011, Putrajaya, Malaysia     A. The concept of clustering is ? : A?A ? R such that ?(a,b) ? R, a,b ? A [2,4,7]. However, the clustering approach is difficult to generate the labels of relations in a network. The supervised method employ a function ? for classifying Z, i.e., ? : Z ? C such that ?(z) = c, z ? Z, and c ? C is a class label, where C = {c1,c2,?,c|C|} is a data set as special target attributes, |C| ? 2 is the number of classes, and Z?C = ? [20, 21, 24]. The classification approaches however only concern with extraction of network based on predefined labels only, and thus cannot be adapted to the other descriptions of relations.

Therefore, this paper addresses such limitations by extending the superficial approach and utilizing some strategies for extracting social network from online database such as the DBLP.



III. PROPOSED METHODS FOR IDENTIFYING RELATIONS We develop an approach by involving the superficial  strategy that depends heavily on the co-occurrence measure in the unsupervised method. The interpretation of co-occurrence in a query, for example, is a composition of ?ta AND tb?, where ta and tb are names of two actors a, b in A. This interpretation in accordance with modeling the returning of search engines such as hit counts. If a singleton event of ta is ?a, ?a is a subset of ? and a doubleton event of ta and tb is ?a??b, ?a??b is a subet ?,, where ? is a set of web pages indexed by a search engine, and P : ? ? [0,1] to be an uniform mass probability function, then we can define a probability of event ta as P(ta) = |?a|/|?| or a probability of event ta and tb as P(ta,tb) = |?a??b|/|?| , where |?| denotes a cardinality.

Building a social network usually involves a list of names which acts a seeds and progressively discovers other names in the Web based upon the co-occurrence concept previously described. This network can be modelled using tree. A tree is a connected acyclic finite graph, and all edges are called branches.

A. Similarity and Strength Relation Similarity measures between two entities are among the  methods to generate strength relation between two actors. For example, one of the widely used similarity measure is the Jaccard coefficient [25], where the extended formula is as follows.

simjac(ta,tb) = |?a??b|/ (|?a|+|?b |-| ?a??b|) (3)  We also developed a similarity measure based on the Kolmogorov complexity as follows.

simour(ta,tb) = log(2|?a??b|)/log(|?a|+|?b|),          (4)  and we used it by utilizing the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) addresses as vector space to generate the underlying strength relation [5].

TABLE I.  RELATIVE TIMELINE OF OCCURRENCES AND CO- OCCURRENCES  Year Occurrences Co-occurrences samn mdw samn & mdw     samn = ?Shahrul Azman Mohd Noah? mdw = ?Michael D. William?    Previous researches [2,5,7] have shown that the use of similarity to generate relationships with singleton and doubleton can produce uncertainty and generate unrealistic number of entity occurrences and co-occurrences. This is due to the number of co-occurrence tends to remain, but the amount of occurrences between paired entities relatively increased as shown as an example in Table I. The problem can also be associated with the name disambiguation issue. As a result, the value of similarity will lead to zero which indicates no relation.

For example, at the time of doing this experiment, a Yahoo!

Search for ta = ?Shahrul Azman Mohd Noah?, returned 1130 hits, while the number of hits for search tb = ?Michael D.

Williams? was 73400000, and searching the pages where both ta and tb gave 67 hits only. Using these figures in Eq. (3) and Eq. (4) yield a strength relation of ? 0.00000087 and ? 0.2678950, respectively. However, if we define each of the previous queries with a keyword, ?dblp?, we obtained 25400, 22, and 4 hit counts for ?Michael D. Williams AND dblp?, ?Shahrul Azman Mohd Noah AND dblp?, and ?ta, tb AND dblp?, respectively. Consequently the values of strength relation by using Eq. (3) and Eq. (4) are 0.000157 and 0.205005, respectively. The latter values of doubleton are more realistic, because within DBLP online database, only 2 (two) papers written by authors ?Shahrul Azman Mohd Noah? and ?Michael D. Williams?. This means that suitable keywords will produce reliable number of occurrences and co-occurrences of entities. Such a keyword is derived from a set of words of what we call as the concepts of current context [5].

B. Association Rule Another implementation of co-occurrence is a formulation  of basic data mining, e.g., the association rule. Assume B = {b1,b2,?,b|B|} is a set of attribute literals, and a set of transaction Mi are subsets of attributes, or Mi be subsets of B.

Then, we define the implication, X => Y with two possible values T = TRUE or F = FALSE as association rule if X be a     subset of B, Y be a subset B and X?Y ? ?. Let q = ?ta AND tx? is a query, where tx is a keyword and ta is a name of actor a ? A as seeds, and Dbi is a collection of document containing names of actors bi ? A, then the transactions be Mi = {q,bi} or {(q => bi)}, q ? X, bi ? Y, Mi ? M. So, by making q always T, (see Table II), we obtain a conditional probability as follows.

?    p(bi|a) = p(|Dbi?(q)|)/p(|(q)|) = |{(q)=T?(bi)=T}|/|{(q)=T}|           (5)  = |{(q=>bi)=T}|/|M|.

The Jaccard coefficient in Eq. (3) is modified as follows.

sim(a,bi) = |{(a=>bi)=T}|/(|M|+|Dbi|-|{(q=>bi)=T}|). (6)   However, if a is a tree and bi is the leaf, then |Dbi| = |{(q=>bi)=T}|. Approximately, we will obtain:   sim(a,b)rel = |{(q=>bi)=T}|/(|M|-c)              (7)   where c = ? is an approximation constant. Then, if bi is the root of other tree, we can formulate a strength relation as follows.

sim(a1,a2)root = 1/?j ? {1,2} (|M|j/|{(q=>bi)=T}j| - ?)  (8)  Thus, based on Eq. (7) and (8), we can use the association rule as the expanded superficial method to extract the social networks by exploiting the information available in the DBLP online database.

C. Label of Network Association rule can be generally defined as b1, ?, b|B|-1 =>  b|B|, where X = {b1,?,b|B|-1}, and Y = {a|B|}. If we used Table II to generate labels of networks in a tree, then we can use TF.IDF scheme for extracting label by considering ? = degree of node as the tree root, i.e.:  TF.IDFw = tf(w)?idf(w)  TF.IDFw = (?j?{1,?,N}?i?{1,...,m} 1/n)(log(N/df(w))) (9)  where n is the number of words in a document, m is the number of word w in document j, N is the total number of documents, and df(w) is the number of documents containing the word w.

The normalization of TF.IDF, is defined as:  tfidfnor = (TF.IDF)(N/?)   (10)  The network with labels is to present a variety of social structures according to the interests and its implementation.

Formally, we can define it as follows.

SNdes = <V,E,A,R,Z,?,?,?1,?2>, V = ?, A = ?  (11)  satisfying the following conditions:  a) There exists ?1 : Z ? V so that for all zi in Za, ?1(zi) in V, and for all a in A and Za is a subset of Z;  b) There exists ?2 : Z ? E so that for all zj in Za?Zb, ?2(zj) in E, for all a,b ? A, and Za, Zb, Za?Zb are subsets of Z.



IV. EXPERIMENT Based from the aforementioned approaches, the extraction  and building of social network from the Web can be carried out according to the following steps and is as illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 1. The extraction of academic social network    1. Provide a list of name of the actors as seeds.

2. Open web pages with URL address and find tables  available the web page.

3. Extract and identify the name of actors from the table.

4. Generate a tree based from the actors' information in  the table.

5. Generate labels of trees from the table.

In this section, we demonstrate the applicability of co- occurrence and some computations. We provide a list of 100 academics from the Faculty of Information Science and     Technology, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia as seeds, and after running the previously mentioned algorithms, only 37 seeds became an actor in the generated tree. For instance, the DBLP web page of ?Shahrul Azman Mohd Noah? contains 43 other names or |M| = 65 co-occurrences, and several of these names also form the academic tree in the academic social network, as shown in Table III.

Let h as the first character of tfv or tlv in a pattern P. For tx = ?dblp?, we get the patterns of URL satisfying a query q in T of Table II, as follows:  P1 : http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a- tree/h/tlv:tfv  P2 : http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a- tree/h/tfv:tlv  P3 : http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/%7Eley/db/indices/a- tree/h/tlv:tfv  P4 : http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/indices/a-tree/h/tlv:tfv  P5 : http://sunsite.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/dblp/db/indicates/a- tree/h/tlv:tfv    Then, we apply the events of bi = T as the actor a (or seed) that generates the web page containing other bi, and the number of co-occurrences are |M| = multiple of number of bi and number of each his/her papers. For example, an actor name is ?Shahrul Azman Mohd Noah? and combine a keyword ?dblp? in a query, the search engine returned DBLP web page with URL address in a pattern  P4: http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/indices/a- tree/n/Noah:Shahrul_Aman_Mohd=.html   TABLE IV.

Leaf b Shahrul Azman Mohd Noah  65    that contains 43 names as leafs of a tree, and 24 (57.14%) of them are the roots of other trees. Relatively, each strength relation simrel (in Table III) occurs if ll (none of URL patterns) be a leaf of tree only, while other nodes of this tree (ll as another tree) have the strength relations from sim(a,b)root and sim(a,b)jac. The results of both similarity measures are compatible, but if the DBLP web pages do not contain the same number of papers for same names, then the results of sim(a,b)jac is an approximation of sim(a,b)root. For example, in     the DBLP web page of ?Shahrul Azman Mohd Noah? there exists 1 (one) paper with an author ?Halimah Badioze Zaman?, but ?Halimah Badioze Zaman?'s DBLP web page listed 2 (two) papers with an author ?Shahrul Azman Mohd Noah?.

Therefore, sim(a,b)root = 0.011111, and it means that sim(a,b)jac ? 0.017391 as an upper bound of sim(a,b)root, and sim(a,b)jac ? 0.008621 as a lower bound of sim(a,b)root, see Table IV.

Extraction of labels by utilizing the DBLP online database, is by exploiting the titles of papers in publications. The tree labels for the entity names of ?Shahrul Azman Mohd Noah? and ?Halimah Badioze Zaman? are the words in {"knowledge",...}. This is achieved by applying Eq. (10).

We also obtain strength relation based on the labels of tree among two roots by using Eq. (4) by defining the vector spaces from tfidfnor. For example, |?a| = ?j?{1,?,m}tfidfnor(a)[j] ? tfidfnor(a)[j], |?b| = ?j?{1,?,m}tfidfnor(b)[j] ? tfidfnor(b)[j], |?a??b| = ?j?{1,?,m}tfidfnor(a)[j] ? tfidfnor(b)[j] if wa = wb, and simour(a,b) = 0.232546.  Both actors (i.e. ?Shahrul Azman Mohd Noah? and ?Halimah Badioze Zaman?) are also connected by other actors, such as, ?Tengku M. T. Sembok?.

V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK Utilizing online database has the potential to semantically  extract trusted and rich academic social networks.  Labels can also be generated from the title of the listed publications. This paper also demonstrates how to use the association rule to expand the superficial approach. Our current work is on evaluating the performance of the proposed approach based on a number of evaluation measures such as precision and recall which has been widely used in information retrieval research.
