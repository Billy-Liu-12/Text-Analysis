An Early Detection System for Foot Ulcera- tion in Diabetic Patients

Abstract-Ulcer formation and proliferation in diabetic patients is a result of said patients' inability to sense the precursors of wound development in the extremities. This loss of a sensation is a result of peripheral neuropathy which is a complication of diabetes. This article presents the research, design, and testing protocol of a device in- tended to act as an early detection system for foot ulcer formation. The device monitors high-risk areas on the soles of the feet for symptoms indicating ulceration. Pres- sure and temperature sensors placed at the targeted high risk areas of an insole are used in conjunction with a data acquisition system to read the necessary data from the soles of patients' feet. Pressure values were taken from the big toe, the ball of plantar, and the heel of a 75kg healthy male while the subject was standing and walking.

The data gathered indicates areas of the plantar that ex- perience the most localized pressure and therefore are at the highest risk for ulceration.



I. INTRODUCTION The aim of this project is to design a device that is capa-  ble of detecting when a patient is at an elevated risk for ulcer formation. Because the patient likely suffers from some de- gree of peripheral neuropathy, the device must be able to sense the things that he or she cannot. There are several subtle warning signs that precede ulcer formation. The two most notable of these warning signs are inflammation and dryness [2].

Inflammation indicates that tissue in the area has been damaged. This presents a detectable symptom: increased tem- perature. A minimum of 2.2?C of difference between "hot spots" on the soles of the feet can occur days before the skin breaks [1]. The DiaPEDic insole will have components that measure this increase and alert the patient to the elevated risk.

Dryness indicates the cessation of autonomic nervous function in the affected area. As sweating ceases, the skin becomes dry and stiff causing it to become more brittle and therefore more likely to crack. Stiffness in plantar tissue will cause areas of higher stress concentration. Foot pressures greater than 6kglcm2 are twice as likely to experience ulcera- tion [1]. Pressure sensors will be able to measure these stress levels and compare them.

Each of these detection methods will be utilized at various high-risk areas on the soles of the feet. The electronic compo- nents will transmit data to the data acquisition system which will interpret and store the information. If any readings are of immediate concern to the patient, an alarm will be triggered.

Otherwise, information taken from readings will be stored for later use by the patient's physician.



II. METHODS Upon conception of the design objectives, research com-  menced to identify key parameters that would determine de- sign direction. Critical items essential to the design objectives were identified as a rudimentary insole, pressure sensors, tem- perature sensors, and a data acquisition processor. In addition, specific quantifiable parameters concerning pressure and tem- perature involvement during ulcer formation in diabetic pe- ripheral neuropathy patients were obtained to ensure accurate, reproducible diagnoses.

Three 5.0kn thermistors and three l1.3kg load sensors were mounted on an insole to be used in conjunction with a 01-700 DATAQ data acquisition system. Research indicated generic thermistors with -5.0kn resistance connected to an operational amplifier would provide an acceptable level of precision for our purposes. The load sensors offer a similarly pertinent level of precision (lcm diameter sensing area) with a significant degree of design practicality afforded by their low profiles and flexibility. The 01-700 DATAQ data acquisition system features a 16-Bit AID Converter with 16 single-ended inputs that more than suffice for the twelve data outputs that will extend from the insoles. The 01-700 includes PC soft- ware for both recording and analysis purposes.

Under hard, soft, folded, and kinked configurations, a constant circumferential load of 55N (50% of the load cell capacity) will be applied to the load cell of each pressure sen- sor. The sensor output will be obtained and the difference will be taken from the input to determine the offset. Each configu- ration will be tested three times using three individual sensors.

Upon acquisition of each configuration offset, an average val- ue will be taken, and the configuration with the lowest average value will be deemed the most efficacious configuration.

Sensors will undergo static and dynamic loading to de- termine sensor output drift. A static load of 55N will be ap- plied for a period of 120 minutes as well as dynamically ap- plied to simulate one year of strenuous use (-1,500 cycles per sensor per day) to each of three pressure sensor load cells.

Corresponding differences between input and output will be evident of output drift.

Utilizing a load applicator head with a small diameter, sensor output will be measured at various points across the load cell diameter under a constant load of 55N. Based on the radius at which the point response is equivalent to the value of the input, we will determine the minimum degree of precision required for patient templating.

A series of device tests will be conducted to ensure sen- sory isolation and prevent erroneous outputs. The conditions to which the device will be subjected are high and low tem- perature settings, submergence under water, and sensor behav-    ior when walking on uneven terrain. The tester will be sub- jected to hot (>38?C) and cold temperatures ?-12?C). The data outputs will be monitored for equal readings from the thermistors, as the coincidence of their values is imperative to the temperature monitoring ulceration process. The tester will step in water as the outputs are monitored to account for high moisture levels that can be experienced by the user. Lastly, the patient will be instructed to walk on an inclined surface, over steps, and on uneven terrains to determine the potential for a false reading to be generated. Upon recognition of sig- nificant accuracy deviation, respective compensatory meas- ures will be taken and testing will be repeated until all signifi- cant environmental sources of error are accounted for.



III. RESULTS Tekscan Flexiforce sensors were placed on three locations  of the foot of a 7 Skg healthy male as depicted in Fig. 1 A. Val- ues were recorded while the patient was standing and walking.

The waveform while the patient was walking can be seen in Fig. 1B of the three locations on the foot. Fig. IC indicates the maximum force calculated by the DATAQ for both of these conditions.

When the patient stands, the waveform indicates a sharp increase and plateau of force distributed among the three leads. As expected, the majority of the weight is distributed on his heel, then on the ball of plantar and fmally the big toe.

However, the opposite is experienced by the patient during  walking. While walking, the waveform (Fig. IB) indicates a rhythmic peak and valley trend. During ambulation, the patient exerts the most pressure on the big toe, while the least amount of pressure is placed on the heel.



IV. DISCUSSION The innovation of this device comes from its ability to  analyze a wide range of temperature and pressure combina- tions in specific areas of the foot at the same time. The pro- gramming of the early warning alarm system is designed to acquire pressure and temperature data changes and compare them with what research has shown to fit dangerously in the range of levels for ulceration to form. The comparison of the patient's foot is accomplished with a pre-programmed set of indicators that detect and analyze temperature and pressure abnormalities  The insole itself incorporates more than one important variable when testing for the formation of ulceration. Through research, it has been determined that a pressure of greater than 6kglcm2 puts a patient with peripheral neuropathy at risk of creating a foot wound. This pressure variable is an important indicator of ulcer formation for two reasons. Firstly, the pres- ence of high pressure around a centralized area can create wound on the foot by the increased friction on that point.

Secondly, pressure may indicate inflammation. An inflamed area on the foot would register more pressure on the sensors by decreasing the surface area of contact with the ground around that specific point. In addition to the dangers associ- ated with friction and rubbing, inflammation has been found to indicate the formation of ulcers in that area. Temperature also plays an important roll. The DiaPEDic insole makes use of multiple ulcer detection variables while allowing constant monitoring in a discreet shoe. Research has shown that a tem- perature difference between corresponding locations on each foot greater than 2.2?C is an indicator of ulcer formation. A greater change in temperature may indicate the beginnings or the growth of inflammation before it can be detected using pressure or observation. In both cases, the DiaPEDic insole provides patients with a level of care that until now had not been provided. By programming the device to detect what has already been shown to indicate ulcer formation, the DiaPEDic insole allows for patients with peripheral neuropathy to iden- tify when their feet are at risk for.
