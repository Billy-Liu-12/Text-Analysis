Abstract - Modeling the space environment of a planet including three dimensional dynamic ?imaging? of the magnetosphere warrants the use of constellations of many spacecrafts. Communication among the various space assets and exchange of mission data for more efficient storage and analysis call for a dynamic and reliable technology capable of managing ad-hoc requests subjected to system and environmental constraints. In this paper12, we propose a cognitive radio architecture that can be used as an extension to space based software defined radio. Simulink is used to demonstrate the behavioral model of a system that represents the executable specifications. In order to illustrate some of the key features of the architecture, a basic model has been created in Simulink. This modeling would enable future implementation of the architecture and support any debugging or restructuring.
