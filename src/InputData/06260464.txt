On the Need for Coordination Among Base

Abstract?In this paper, we study the impact of different resource allocation schemes, transmission coordination mechanisms among base stations, and user association rules in the context of the downlink of a heterogeneous network comprising of a macro base station overlaid with a pool of low-power pico base stations. We formulate flow-based models for the joint optimization of resource allocation, user association, user scheduling and transmis- sion coordination under a proportional fair throughput objective for two types of resource allocation, i.e, Full Sharing (FS) and Channel Splitting (CS), and two types of transmission coordination, i.e., no coordination and ON- OFF coordination. Our formulations allow us to obtain exact solutions for small to medium sized networks. The numerical results show that the performance of FS without transmission coordination among BSs is much worse than CS without coordination. However, FS with our coordina- tion mechanism performs as well as CS with coordination.

Interestingly, FS and CS with coordination do not perform much better than CS without coordination. Our study provides a message that we might not need to go for the complexity of transmission coordination among BSs depending upon the resource allocation scheme.



I. INTRODUCTION  Cellular network operators are facing an overwhelm-  ing growth in data traffic. One way to deal with this  growth is to adopt a heterogeneous network (Hetnet) ar-  chitecture where low power base stations (BSs) overlay  the existing macro infrastructure [1]. Pico BSs (PBSs)  are a type of low-power BSs deployed by the operators.

In our study, we consider an OFDM based system where  a set of PBSs are deployed within the coverage of a  macro BS (MBS). We focus on the downlink (D/L).

This study is relevant in the context of (but not limited  to) 3GPP LTE-Advanced air interface [1]. Overlaying a  pool of PBSs over an MBS coverage poses a new set  of technological challenges. Interference management is  perhaps one of the greatest challenges in this context  and is achieved by a mix of several processes such as  resource allocation and transmission coordination which  will be discussed next.

In the OFDM context, several resource allocation  approaches have been proposed including Channel Split-  ting (CS) where PBSs are allocated a pool of subchan-  nels orthogonal to the set of subchannels on which  the MBS operates, and Full Sharing (FS) where all  transmitters (PBSs and MBS) operate in the same set of  subchannels, thereby mutually interfering. 3GPP iden-  tifies these two approaches as multi-carrier and co-  channel deployment, respectively [1]. FS is a relevant  approach mainly owing to its simplicity. CS on the  other hand is more flexible as the size of the pool of  subchannels allocated to the PBSs can be dynamically  adjusted if needed. It also results in lower interference.

However, the performance of channel splitting largely  depends upon the exact way in which the splitting is  carried out. The performance of both FS and CS heavily  depend upon other network processes (i.e., transmission  coordination and user association).

Transmission coordination manages interference by  coordinating the BSs, i.e., by scheduling the BSs in  time while performing power control. We study a type  of transmission coordination, that we call the ON-OFF  transmission coordination where scheduling is done by  allowing a BS at any time to either transmit with the  maximum power available or not transmit at all. We  compare the performance of such a coordination when  performed optimally with the case of no coordination  where the BSs transmit all the time at full power.

Clearly, the optimal ON-OFF coordination of BSs is  equivalent to scheduling these BSs in a centralized  manner, which is complex but is considered as a viable  option in LTE-A [2].

In heterogeneous networks, user association is an-  other important network process that affects the per-  formance. Conventionally, in homogeneous networks, a  user associates to the BS with the best signal-to-noise-  and-interference ratio (SINR). However, in a Hetnet  context, such a rule does not work well [3]. User  scheduling is also an important network process that  affects the performance of a wireless network greatly.

The four important network processes introduced so  far, namely resource allocation, transmission coordi-  nation, user association and user scheduling have a  complex interplay. For a given system, multiple con-  figurations are possible depending on the resource allo-  cation, transmission coordination, user association and  user scheduling options. In our study, we limit the  resource allocation options to CS and FS, the trans-  mission coordination options to no coordination and  ON-OFF coordination, the user association options to  2012 10th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc and Wireless Networks (WiOpt), 14-18 May 2012  978-3-901882-45-6/2012 - Copyright is with IFIP 254    optimal association, and the user scheduling options to  a global optimal scheduling based on a global propor-  tional fairness objective function. Hence, we study the  following four specific configurations under optimal user  association and user scheduling: (1) [CS]: optimal CS  without coordination among BSs, (2) [CS-O]: optimal  CS with optimal ON-OFF coordination among BSs,  (3) [FS]: Full Sharing without coordination among  BSs, and (4) [FS-O]: Full Sharing with optimal ON-  OFF coordination among BSs. Depending upon the  configuration, we formulate a global joint optimal user  association and user scheduling problem ([FS]), a global  joint optimal user association, user scheduling and trans-  mission coordination problem ([FS-O]), a global joint  optimal user association, user scheduling and resource  allocation problem ([CS]), and a global joint optimal  user association, user scheduling, resource allocation  and transmission coordination problem ([CS-O]). User  scheduling in [CS] and [FS] could in fact be performed  locally (i.e., each BS scheduling independently from the  others) while it has to be done globally along with  transmission coordination for [CS-O] and [FS-O]. A  problem formulation based on local scheduling was  proposed in [3] and is clearly a simpler approach for  solving [CS] and [FS]. However, problem formulations  based on local scheduling do not generalize to [CS-O] or  [FS-O]. By using the concept of ?independent sets?, we  could unify all four configurations into one framework  and could model the user scheduling and transmission  coordination processes together. This however makes  the problem formulations for [CS] and [FS] slightly  more complex. We accept this complexity for the sake  of a unified framework. These problems are formulated  using flow-based models for a system ?snapshot?. By a  system ?snapshot?, we mean that the system parameters  like the number of users and the channel gains among  the transmitter-receiver pairs are known and are fixed.

For such a system snapshot, our optimization models  can be used to configure the network processes (i.e,  resource allocation, transmission coordination and user  association) all at once, optimally. This is thus an  offline-static study. For tractability, we assume multipath  routing which is equivalent to allowing users to associate  with one or more BSs. We later show that these flow-  based models with multipath routing provide tight upper  bounds on the performance of systems where a user is  allowed to associate to only one BS. The upper bounds  provided by our model can be used as benchmarks for  the performance of practical and online resource allo-  cation, user association and transmission coordination  algorithms. Our main contributions can be summarized  as follows.

? We formulate a tractable network flow-based uni-  fied framework for a multi-rate heterogeneous net-  work comprising of one macro and several pico  base stations. This framework allows us to solve  the four different problems introduced above under  an assumption of multi-BS association.

? Using numerical results, we provide important en-  gineering insights on the throughput performance  of different configurations, under a global propor-  tional fairness (PF) objective function.

? FS without transmission coordination barely  justifies the deployment of PBSs in the first  place. However, in the presence of a good  interference mitigation via ON-OFF transmis-  sion coordination, FS performs significantly  better.

? CS performs very well even in the absence of  sophisticated transmission coordination.

? Multipath routing, as assumed in our model,  offers an upper bound on the performance of  systems where a user associates to only one  BS. We show that the upper bounds provided  by our model are tight. This also shows that  allowing a user to associate with multiple BSs  will not offer significant performance gains.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we  present the related work. In Section III, we describe the  general system model. Section IV contains the problem  formulations. In Section V, we discuss the tightness of  the solutions based on our flow-based unified framework  with multi-BS association. In Section VI, we present  the numerical results and the engineering insights.



II. RELATED WORK  Resource allocation, user association and transmis-  sion coordination are well-known network processes  and have been studied extensively in the heterogeneous  network context. However, these network processes are  not usually studied jointly. [4] studies the performance  of different types of resource allocation schemes under a  conventional user association rule where a user is served  by the BS offering the highest SINR. However, associ-  ation of users to BSs following simple user association  rules are shown to result in sub-optimal performance  [3]. Formulating and solving an optimal user association  problem on the other hand is not trivial. [5], [6] have  studied the optimal user association problem under a  network-wide proportionally fair throughput optimiza-  tion framework. [7] studies a number of approximation  algorithms to the user association problem under the  total throughput maximization objective. User associ-  ation problems usually belong to a class of problems  identified as generalized assignment problems (GAP).
