Condition Monitoring of Induction Motors Using  Combined PSD based Wavelet Decomposition and

Abstract-- Condition monitoring of machines has its roots in the human ECG analysis for detecting cardiac arrhythmias.

Condition monitoring in industry is desirable for increasing machinery availability, reducing consequential damage, and improving the operational efficiency.  This is very significant in industries that use heavy duty machines for various processes.

E.g.: A monstrous three-phase AC induction motor to drive a city water supply pump or very big, high power motors used in mills, huge generators for generating power in hydel plants etc depict a few of them. Also, for safety and economic considerations, there is a need to monitor the behavior of motors working in critical production processes as well. This paper demonstrates how the condition of an induction motor can be monitored by the analysis of the acoustic signal that represents the non-stationary vibration data. The analysis have been done using various signal processing algorithms and a new and better classification technique has been developed using the combined wavelet based PSD analysis and Spider Web Plots. The proposed method appears to give better performance.

I. INTRODUCTION  NDUCTION machines are the primary source of mechanical power in industries due to their rugged  construction, high reliability and better efficiencies. Early warnings on the physical condition of machines are important for increasing machinery availability, reducing consequential damage, and improving the operational efficiency. Even though electrical sensing with an emphasis on analyzing the motor stator current have been utilized widely, vibration-based condition monitoring has attracted the attention of many researchers working in the area of induction machines, and has gained industrial acceptance, as vibration analysis techniques are quite effective in assessing a machine?s health [1]. It is claimed that vibration monitoring is the most reliable method of assessing the overall health of a rotor system [2]-[5]. Most methods are to analyze the vibration signal in either time- domain or frequency-domain. Frequency-domain analysis is more attractive because it can provide more detailed information about the status of the machine [6]. Due to the averaging problems in classic FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) analysis, there is a good chance that the significant lines which correspond to certain faults may be hidden. The STFT (Short time Fourier Transform) has the shortcoming that it uses a  sliding window of constant width, which causes resolution problems in analysis [7]. The variable time resolution given by the Wavelet transforms makes it a good choice for analysis of quasi-steady vibration signals. The power-distribution function resulting from a wavelet transformation appears to be the optimal method to be applied to nonstationary signals to show changes in the amplitude and distribution of the harmonics [8]. This PSD (Power Spectral Density) concept has been tested in stator current of the motor. Much of the work done till now has been to identify faults like stator short circuiting, bearing damages and the broken rotor bars.

Electrical faults, which can go unnoticed, in running conditions, like the single phasing faults and mechanical faults like the loose foundation bolts of the machine are equally dangerous for the motor health. If the size of the motor is huge, the loose foundation bolts, if went unnoticed can even cause the destruction of the building in which the motor is kept. Also the impact of variable load conditions along with the fault has not been discussed till now, and that opens up an area to investigate how the PSD parameters change with load, along with the faults and whether these faults can be identified using them, under various load conditions. This paper presents the methods for the online detection of Induction-motor faults based on wavelet based PSD analysis of the vibration data combined with spider web plots. The method is useful for effective online monitoring and diagnosis in industrial applications. The experiments performed and the results obtained show that wavelet based PSD analysis achieves good results in the field of fault diagnosis for every operating point of the induction motor. This when combined with the selective weighting of PSD?s using spider web plots yields better classification of faults.



II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP  The experimental setup has been created in lab using a 10HP motor. The Monitran (MTN 1130)? piezoelectric accelerometer has been used for fetching the vibration data.

The motor was loaded directly using dynamometers. The Yokogawa?s DL1620? was used as the data acquisition system. A digital filter (0-10 kHz bandwidth), was used to remove the unwanted noise and useless overtones. The motor current, speed, load and the vibration data were measured.

Only vibrations are used for analytical purposes. The sampling rate set for recording the data was 50 kHz. A high sampling rate is desired to avoid aliasing and thereby to preserve the integrity of the data. A high speed USB device has been used for transferring the data from the instrument.

III. PROPOSED APPROACH  The conventional Fourier and STFT have been well discussed and tried out in many of the previous works like in [1],[6]. The drawbacks of Fourier and STFT approach has lead to the widespread use of wavelets for processing the data.

Wavelet analysis can reveal aspects of data that other signal analysis techniques fail to spot, such as trends, breakdown points, discontinuities in higher derivatives, and self-similarity [8]. Also, for many decades scientists have wanted more appropriate functions than the trigonometrical sines and cosines, which have been the basis of Fourier analysis, to approximate choppy signals. By their definition, these functions are non-local (and stretch out to infinity). They therefore do a very poor job in approximating sharp spikes.

But with the advent of Wavelet analysis, we can use approximating functions that are contained neatly in finite domains. Wavelets are well-suited for approximating data with sharp discontinuities [9]. All similar observations on the properties of wavelets make it an Ideal tool for our analysis.

CWT (Continuous Wavelet Transform) is defined as:  ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )[ ]? ?= dtttxW    1, ??????       (1) The constant  (1/ )?  is used for normalization purposes,  ? is the time delay and ?  is the scale.

The DWT of a function x(t) can be expressed as:  ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )? ?? ?  =  ?  ??=  ?  ??= +=  00 ,,   jj k  kjj k  kjj tkdtkctx ??   (2)  In this expansion, the first summation gives a function that is a low resolution or coarse approximation of x(t) at scale 0j  .

For each increasing j in the second summation, a higher or finer resolution function is added, which adds increasing details. The choice of 0j  sets the coarsest scale, whose space is spanned by, ( )tkj ,0?  [10].

These wavelet coefficients, under certain conditions, can completely describe the original function, and in a way similar to Fourier series coefficients, can be used for analysis, description, approximation, and filtering. If the scaling function is well behaved, then at a high scale, samples of the signal are very close to the scaling coefficients.

The methodology adopted for the purpose is given: 1) Acquiring the vibration signal or data 2) Processing the data using the best tool available for  nonstationary signals-The Wavelet 3) Choosing the proper wavelet for  analysis  4) Calculating the PSD of the wavelet decompositions and finding out the proper indicator for healthy or faulty conditions.

5) Improving the classification of faults using the newly proposed method -The spider web plots.

The experiments were conducted for no-load and loaded conditions of healthy or normal operating conditions as well as faulty conditions. The aim of the work has been to see whether the PSD technique, which was proposed in [8], can be a good choice for detecting and classifying the single phasing and loose foundation bolts faults under different load conditions. Our new proposed technique, The Selective Weighting using Spider Web Plots, gives better classification of faults and is a promising technique for online monitoring of machine faults. The analysis can be extended to the cases of machines with broken rotor bars and shorted windings as in [8], where the results of classification of faults are still missing.



IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS  A number of experiments were conducted on the healthy and faulty conditions under no-load and loaded conditions. A total of One Million samples of data were captured for each case. The data was downsampled by 2 before processing.

After downsampling, 32768 data points has been taken for further processing. Four such sets have been chosen for all investigations and comparisons. Two wavelets were selected for processing. To avoid overlapping between two adjacent frequency bands, a high-order mother wavelet that results in high-order frequency filter should be used [8]. Therefore Debauchies10 was selected as suggested by these Authors [8].

But upon detailed investigation, it was found that, the response of the wavelet was poor for lower order frequency bands. Similar results were obtained for other Debauchies family, like DB6. The PSD values did not showing any significant changes in the lower frequency bands, where changes do occur [6], [7] due to electrical faults. Also, for the mechanical fault considered here, it was found to be not a suitable choice. Next, the Morlet wavelet was tested. This was also suggested by the authors for electrical faults [6], under no-load condition. This choice proved to be good for fault detection under no-load and loaded conditions. Also an efficient load Indicator was found using the proposed wavelet based analysis.

TABLE II WAVELET FREQUENCY BANDS FOR ANALYSIS  Scaling Factor Frequency Bands (Hz)  2 12500-6250  4 6250-3250  8 3250-1625  16 1625-812.5  32 812.5-406.25  64 406.25-203.125  128 203.125-101.5625  256 101.5625-50.78125  512 50.78125-25.3906    Case 1: Healthy or Normal Condition and increasing Torque  The motor is run under balanced three phase voltage and vibration data is collected for normal conditions, under no- load and loaded conditions.

Fig. 1. Vibration data obtained for healthy condition: no-load     Fig. 2. Variation of PSD?s for various scaling factors for Morlet CWT under no-load    The Bar graph shown in Fig. 2 indicates the PSD values for  the no-load condition. There are slight variations in the value of PSD in one scale itself. So we are taking the average values, to take into account the variations that occur. We can see that, the wavelet has a good response to higher scales which was not there for the Debauchies family of wavelets.

This makes it a better choice for our analysis. The bar graphs obtained when DB10 was used is shown in Fig. 3. It can be seen that, the PSD values at higher scales are very low, where changes do occur due to faults.

Fig. 3. Variation of PSD?s for various scaling factors for DB10 under no-  load      Fig. 4. Variation of PSD?s for various scaling factors for Morlet CWT under heavy load   The bar graph in Fig. 4 shows the PSD values obtained  under heavy load condition. It can be seen from Fig. 2 and Fig. 4 that the PSD at scaling level six increases with load.

From no-load to full load, this shows a linear rise in the value.

The average PSD values were found to rise from 4.933349 in no-load to 14.01358 for the full load condition. Even though other PSD values for other scaling factors do change, only the level six scaling and the corresponding PSD could act as the load indicator under healthy and faulty conditions.

Case 2: Single Phasing Condition and increasing Torque  The electrical faults affect the lower order frequency ranges of the vibration data. Therefore, in the single phasing condition we expect a hike in the average PSD values in the higher scales. The fault was created by connecting a switch in one of the phases and opening it during motor running condition.

Fig. 5. Variation of PSD?s for various scaling factors for Morlet CWT  under single phasing no-load  From Fig. 5 and 7, it is clear that, a noticeable hike in PSD  is there in the 50.78125-25.3906 Hz range. The average value was found to be 103.01 for the four sets of data, for no-load condition. For the loaded condition the values of PSD for scaling factors four and five were found to be excellent indicators of the fault. The average value of PSD at fourth scaling factor varied from 26.58916 to 44.89249 from no-load to higher loaded conditions. In normal condition it ranged from 18.66039 to 25.87709 only.  PSD at the fifth scaling was increasing with load, which is the reverse in case of healthy    condition. Both of these with average PSD for ninth scaling factor (for no-load) were found to be excellent indicators of the fault.

From Fig. 6, it is seen that the response of the DB10 wavelet to the vibration signal is not so pronounced at higher scales. Similar patterns were obtained for healthy condition and loose foundation bolts. No significant changes were noticed in the frequency bands were variations are expected for the faults considered here. The changes occurred in the 800-3200 Hz, which is not sufficient indicator for the fault.

Fig. 6. Variation of PSD?s for various caling factors for DB10 under single  phasing no-load   Fig. 7. Variation of PSD?s for various scaling factors for Morlet CWT under  single phasing medium load   Case 3: Loose Foundation bolts and increasing Torque  The machine was mounted on a strong foundation and directly loaded using dynamometers. The foundation bolts were loosened for the machine. The machine was run under unloaded and loaded conditions, and the vibrations were fetched. The vibration signal was logged and analyzed in the same way as it was done for all cases of healthy and single phasing condition. The supply voltage and the frequency were kept constant when the experiments were conducted.

The Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 indicate the value of PSD for different scales for light load and medium load condition. We can see that PSD for the fourth scaling factor has a high average value, which is a good indicator for the fault. Similar values were obtained for no-load to high load condition.

But, this classification may not be appropriate, since it causes an overlap with single phasing condition under light  loads. Therefore, comparing with the normal case, we can say that it indicated a fault, but we can?t tell what the fault is exactly. Also the loose foundation bolts is a mechanical fault, whose behavior will vary with the size or the moment of inertia of the machine. To improve the classification, we introduced the concept of selective weighting of PSD values using the spider web plots.

V.  THE SPIDER WEB PLOTS FOR THE PSD VALUES  A. Construction  The spider web plot is a conceptual management tool.

Spider diagrams, sometimes called star plots, function as radial plots that display the magnitude of the measures as lines radiating from a central point. Targets or strategic goals are plotted on these lines and connected around the circle. The resulting diagram looks much like a spider's web. Usually standardized to the same scale, the different measurements represent concentric polygons, with this year's results outside of the current targets, which in turn lie outside of last year's performance levels [11]. Various potential suppliers need to be compared with an objective and consistent frame of reference [12]. This potential management tool is been used in combination with PSD values to generate the spider-web plots.

In Fig. 10, the values Si, Si+1? etc indicates the values of the PSD in any one condition of the motor. Such plots are made for the average values of the PSD?s under all conditions.

These lines are connected around the circle.

The angle between two such lines is 360/n, where n is the number of PSD values considered (n=9 here). The plot looks much like a spider web. We are calculating the areas (A1, A2 A3, A4 etc), taking one of the values as the common side of both the triangles. The two areas obtained are added to get the total area. This is done by keeping one of the PSD values as a common base of two triangles. Then area calculation is shifted clockwise to obtain other areas in similar manner. Depending on the magnitude of the PSD, there can be two types of triangles (for eg. A1 and A2 or A3 and A4). For both categories of triangle, the formula for area calculation remains the same. The areas are calculated and tabulated.

Fig. 10. Spider web plot construction   B. Analysis Results  The areas obtained from the spider web plots had been compared. Eight areas from A1 to A8 were obtained for each case. The aim of doing this was to improve the classification  of faults. The results show that, while comparing the healthy and the fault conditions, this method provides a better classification with minimum overlaps, under various torque values.

Table III shows the spider web areas obtained for single phasing and Table IV gives the areas obtained for loose foundation bolts for increasing loads. The A4 and A6 areas are consistently increasing and decreasing with load for healthy condition. For single phasing condition A4 is a very good indicator for its value rises very much with increase in load (This value decreases in case of healthy condition). In no load condition A4 has high values, as given in Table III.

In case of loose bolts (Table IV) A8 is a good indicator at no load and as load rises, value of A8 is found to be below the ranges seen elsewhere in any condition, except for one high load condition. It is seen that there is only a very small difference between indicators for no-load and heavy load in single phasing and loose foundation bolts. This overlap can be further minimized, if we use a higher HP motor for the mechanical fault. It is seen that the spider web method is much better than the PSD analysis for classification of faults.



VI. CONCLUSIONS  This paper presents the methods for the online detection of Induction-motor faults based on wavelet based PSD analysis of the vibration data combined with spider web plots. The method is useful for effective online monitoring and diagnosis in industrial applications. The experiments performed and the results obtained show that wavelet based PSD analysis achieves better results in the field of fault diagnosis for every operating point of the induction motor. This, when combined with the selective weighting using spider web plots yields much better classification.

More investigation with no-load and variable load conditions may be done with different motors to make the results obtained more concrete. This method can be extended for monitoring cases of broken rotor bars, bearing damages etc. in the case of squirrel cage induction motors.
