Abstract?Recent technological developments allowed  envisioning sensor devices with distributed ambient sensory network, which could be a potential technology for monitoring various natural phenomena (weather parameters, soil moisture, etc.) at micro level. As days more and more agricultural data are virtually being harvested along with the crops and are being collected/stored in databases, the same data can be used in productive decision making if appropriate data mining techniques are developed/applied. An experiment was conducted with four consecutive (Kharif and Rabi) agricultural seasons in a semi-arid region of India to understand the crop-weather- environment-pest/diseases relations using wireless sensory and field-level surveillance data on closely related and interdependent pest/disease dynamics of groundnut crop.  Association rule mining and multivariate regression mining techniques/algorithms were designed/ developed/tailor-made to turn the data into useful information/ knowledge/relations/trends to know crop-weather- environment-pest/disease continuum. These findings have been used for development of prediction models (cumulative and non- cumulative) followed by a web based pest/disease decision support system, which will help the decision makers to take viable ameliorative measures.

I. INTRODUCTION  In the practices of agricultural information, the agricultural intelligence monitoring system is an important and indispensable link [27]. The advanced sensor technology and the intelligence information processing technology are important methods to promise gathering real time data accurately and quantitatively to solve different parameters pertaining to weather, crop, soil and environment, which in turn help in developing open solutions for majority of the agricultural processes [23]. With the advent of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), information acquisition and the processing technology has seeped gradually into agricultural domain by the characteristics such as low-cost, low-power consumption, small devices equipped with limited sensing, data processing and wireless communication capabilities, which perfectly suites for precision agriculture where decisions are to be made at micro-climatic level at right time/place/input [12][18][28]. It  seems natural to assess the potential of WSNs, in particular, the increased space and time resolution they bring to crop-soil- weather-environment continuum data at an affordable price with high spatio-temporal nature in real-time [8].

Crop loss, particularly oilseeds, due to pests and diseases are quite considerable, particularly in the semi-arid conditions [15]. Among the oilseed crops, Groundnut extent its large space despite its prone to pests and diseases. Significant crop losses by pest/diseases have been reported from Australia, India, South Africa, China, USA, etc. [3][10][17][19].  Among the pests, Thrips specie comes with a complex life cycle, starting from vegetative stage to till the harvest of the crop.

Besides causing direct damage to the crop, Thrips are known to cause more indirect damage by attacking as vectors of viral disease viz. groundnut Bud Necrosis Virus (BNV). In India, the BNV disease occurs with the incidence ranging from 0-98% [11][25] and its infection in the young stage will result in death of the plant due to severe necrosis. The major foliar/fungal diseases of groundnut, particularly in semi-arid tropic region, caused by fungi are Rust and Leaf Spot, which causes yield losses roughly between 50 to 80 % [20][25][26]. Temperature, humidity, rainfall, leaf wetness and wind speed are the chief weather parameters influencing the pest/disease incidence [26].

It is rather difficult to establish a direct cause and effect relationship between any single climatic factor and disease activity as the effect of these weather elements on the disease is usually confounded [25].

There is a growing amount of data available from many resources that can be used effectively in many areas of human activities. With the ever-increasing amount of information about the farms, farmers are not only harvesting in terms of agriculture output but also large amounts of data. In order to extract only the useful information as well as to understand compounded relationships, these data need to be analyzed and used for optimization [7][23]. Computational techniques can be designed to perform respective tasks and to substitute for human ability [14].   Such data can be used in productive decision making if appropriate data mining (DM) techniques are applied. In fact, applications of data mining techniques in agriculture emerged just recently, and therefore, there are not yet any specific data mining techniques specifically tailored to solve agricultural-related problems [14]. However, different      data mining techniques/algorithms (Naive Bayes with Gaussian distribution, Association Rule Mining and Multivariate Regression ) were tailor-made to turn the data into useful information/ knowledge/relations/trends and correlation to understand crop-weather-pest/disease continuum [20][23].

It is essential that an efficient methodology should be capable of forecasting the pest and disease dynamics accurately. In the present research, micro climatic data (temperature, humidity, leaf wetness and soil moisture) were obtained through wireless Mote based AgriSens distributed sensing system.  DM techniques and surveillance data have been used to understand and quantify hidden correlations between crop-pest/disease-weather parameters. Subsequently, multivariate regression and empirical models for groundnut pest /disease have been developed for prediction (cumulative and non-cumulative) followed by a web based a Decision Support System (DSS) with multi-season data that can help the stakeholders to take appropriate decision for groundnut crop protection, which will help increase environmental and yield conditions.



II. MATERIAL AND METHODS  In order to study the crop-soil-weather-pest/disease interactions, a test bed for WSN experiment was chosen at Agriculture Research Institute (ARI) of ANGR Agricultural University, Hyderabad, which falls in semi-arid tropic region.

The test bed, where long term weather-based experiments are being carried out on groundnut crop, will provide a platform for validation (including comparisons) of the proposed model with ground level studies. This work is a part of Indo-Japan initiative to develop a real time decision support system, called GeoSense, integrating Geographical Information Communication Technology (Geo-ICT) and WSN for Precision Agriculture [8].

A. Standard Experimental Setup Studies on crop-weather-disease interaction were carried out consecutively in two Kharif (monsoon) (2009 and 2010) and two Rabi (post-monsoon) (2009-10 and 2010-11) agriculture seasons. A standard field experiment design was laid out in the test bed with P1 (unprotected plot, which is a normal situation in farmers field) and P2 (weather based protection plots); four different dates of sowing (D1, D2, D3 and D4) treatments; and three replicas (R1, R2 and R3) which are placed randomly.

These different dates will determine the impact of disease incidence in order to observe dynamics in pre (D1), normal (D2 and D3) and post normal (D4) weeks of sowing. Apart from this, to have uniform and unbiased observations, surveillance data has been collected from each plot in randomly selected one square meter area locations of each plot (S1D1, S1D2, S1D3, S1D4, S2D1, S2D2, S2D3, S2D4,???) during flowering to harvest crop phenological stages.

B.  Surveillance Data Collection Thrips, BNV, Rust (RT) and Leaf Spot (LS) population  dynamics (surveillance data) were obtained at every week  from flowering to reproductive pheonological stages, where majority of disease incidences occur at various locations in the experimental site. The surveillance data has been collected weekly instead of daily as there may not be any significant visible changes in pest/disease incidences.  A total of 48 observations (12 weeks X 4 different dates of sowing) were made with respect to different dates of sowing in each season.

Along with this, groundnut crop age (that is at which stage of the crop the disease attack takes place and their dynamics trends) also recorded week- wise to understand the infection dynamics of disease.

Fig.  1.  Surveillance data collection one square meter area   Five poles were placed in each one square meter and  numbered 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 (Fig. 1). Subsequently, data has been collected manually from the plants adjacent to each stick for all four seasons. The surveillance data includes number of leaf-lets that are infected by pest/disease, number of plants infected in the one square meter area, date of flowering, date of recording the surveillance data, etc.  The plants have been numbered in the form of ID like R1P1D1-1, R1P1D1-2, R1P1D2-1, etc. so as to retrieve their respective data easily from the database (e.g. R1P1D1-1 indicates Plant Number 1 of replica R1 from P1 plot with date of Sowing D1 from one square meter area).

C.   Sensory Data Collection AgiSens [18][21], an end to end WSN system, was deployed in the test bed to monitor micro level weather parameters.

AgiSens, a set of battery-powered nodes embedded with wireless sensors (temperature sensor, humidity sensor, leaf wetness sensor, soil moisture sensor), was used to continuously monitor sensory soil-crop-weather parameters.

The sensory data was routed through multi-hop communication to an embedded gateway where data is processed and stored in a structured database. The embedded gateway is connected to internet through general packet radio service (GPRS) interface which facilitated smooth transfer of data to the server (remotely located) for data storing. The data collected, thus, was stored in an Open Source database PostgreSQL for further analysis and mining. Fig. 2 shows the schematics of wireless sensor network with agricultural / environment sensors deployed in the field. Each node was able to transmit/receive data packets to/from other nodes every 15 minute over a transmission range of 25 meter. Data collected by the sensors were wirelessly transferred in a multi-hop manner to a base station node (stargate) connected with embedded gateway for data logging.

Fig. 2.  WSN architecture in the experimental site  AS is a predefined closed-loop system, which senses the data automatically at user-defined intervals. The interval (data collection timing) depends on the sampling requirement. AS comprises three main components: (i) MICAz mote (sensor pods connected with an array of sensors), (ii) signal processing/transmission (two-tier hierarchical cluster topology) and (iii) software development (algorithm process for raw sensory data conversion to useable format and user friendly GUI to view the sensory data.

(i) The MICAz (2.4 GHz Mote) is a low-powered wireless sensor network platform that includes  reliable and ad-hoc mesh networking, IEEE 802.15.4 compliant radio frequency (RF) transceiver, associated sensor board, MDA300-CA sensor pod, direct sequence spread spectrum radio, which is resistant to RF interference and provides inherent data security with 250 kbps data rate  support. The platform also includes plug and play with sensor boards, data acquisition boards, gateway (for transmitting sensory data). Apart from the onboard sensors (relative humidity and ambient temperature), AS is also embedded with external sensors viz. leaf wetness, soil moisture and soil temperature sensors.

(ii) Zigbee-based communication (receiving and transmitting) program takes charge of receiving orders/data from sink node (data transmitting node) as well as sending its own data to other/sink nodes and then to base  station node (gateway). AS deployment consists of multiple nodes (client nodes) in the experimental bed. If the client node broadcasts a packet then it becomes a cluster-head. All nodes that receives packet stop their timers and become a member (one of the client nodes) of the cluster-head depending on the strength of the received signal. The member sends a ?member announce? packet to its cluster-head. The cluster-head collects data using time division multiple access.

During data transmission phase, every node is assigned a level based on its proximity to the base station, which is assigned level 0 (for base station, i.e. stargate) and others nodes as 1, 2, 3, etc. After collecting data from all its members, a cluster-head searches for the nearest lowest-level cluster-head. The cluster-head broadcasts a beacon containing its ID and level (IEEE 802.15.4), and all cluster-heads in the lower level that receive this beacon acknowledge specifying their own ID and level. The cluster-head transmits its data to the base station; it follows this process till the base station (stargate/gateway) receives all the data. This approach becomes particularly attractive in heterogeneous settings when the cluster-head nodes are more powerful in terms of  computation/communication. Stargate is a powerful single- board computer with enhanced communications and sensor signal processing capabilities. It has been configured with PostgreSQL database server to log the data from AS cluster- heads and then send the sensory data from the PostgreSQL database to the GeoSense centralized server database via GPRS.

(iii) Agrisens has a dedicated server for storing, processing and publishing the data in the web environment by using, Apache, MySQL, PHP and Perl tools. AgriSens web interface has been developed with HTML and PHP languages, along with PostgreSQL, which acts as a backend database that stores data in a structured format. The interface helps the user to view/download the data in Excel as well as in graphical (Line) formats.

The sensory data, thus, transmitted is raw and has been converted in to a usable format in real time through appropriate conversion formula (by using open-source server- side scripting language PHP) in the server end and user friendly graphical user interface to view the sensory data in various formats. Both raw and the real data from multiple sensor nodes have been stored in different database for further analysis and mining.

D.   Proposed  DM Models  Various DM techniques and a few algorithms were used/developed to understand the pest/disease dynamics from sensory and weather station based meteorological and other surveillance parameters in groundnut crop. Raw sensory data obtained from the experimental field is not uniform in its collection. Owing to the climatic conditions or non-function of field sensors or due to network errors, there have been a few breaks in collecting continuous sensory data that may lead to biased outcomes while developing the model. Relative data from the nearest sensor node was used to fill the missing data with Expectation?Maximization (EM) algorithm [9]. The dataset was provided in daily and weekly means wherever is required. Quality data is accomplished by performing satisfactory pre-processing methodology such as data selection, data reduction and elimination of null values or other noise values.

As the crop was infested with multiple pests and diseases, multi-level classification modules were developed in the model, which classifies pest/diseases based on their severity.

Naive Bayes classification with Gaussian distribution [16], [27] was used in the experiment. Bayesian network principle was used to model uncertainty by combining experimental knowledge and observational evidences. Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB) classifier, which is a term in Bayesian statistics dealing with a simple probabilistic classifier based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence, was used to assume the presence (or absence) of a particular feature of a class unrelated to the presence (or  absence) of any other feature [27]. For example, a disease symptom may be considered to be LS or Rust owing to the shape and place of the spot on the leaflet, color, texture, damaged leaflets, etc.

Rapid association rule mining (RARM) [4] was used in association with above classification techniques to find out      correlation of multiple weather and other related parameters with respect to pest/diseases.  This phenomenon-based algorithm is to identify signature patterns as well to discover presence/dependency [1][4] with other related pest/disease and/or soil-crop-weather-environmental parameters. The outcomes are in the form of correlation index values ranging from -1 to 1.  Following are the MVR models developed for pest/diseases.

Where, I? = Infection index, I = sole BNV incidence, Ith = Thrips incidence, Wnd= Wind speed and AGDD is the accumulated growing degree days.

E.   Predictions Models Forecasting and warning systems for pests and diseases become more important for taking right decision at right time so as to save the crop, and particularly the infrequent climate conditions and environment. Depending upon the data availability, different types of models can be utilized for development of prediction models. Following are two models, one week prediction model (1WK) and cumulative prediction (CWK), followed in the study:  1) One week Prediction (1WK) - Empirical as well as multivariate prediction model, thus developed, has been used by taking historical data and was used for one week prediction. For example, for one week prediction of BNV in Kharif 2010 season, previous year?s same season and week data was used in the model. However, pest/disease life cycle plays an important role for their prediction.

2) Cumulative Prediction (CWK)- A complex Polynomial Cumulative model [2] was also adopted and modified by including various local conditions viz. maximum pest population, time of first appearance, time of maximum pest population/disease severity as well as life cycle, season, weather parameter, age of crop (AC), incidence at flowering stage, growing degree days, previous year record, correlation with other pest/disease, previous season crop for disease forecasting [24]):  eZbZaaY j  jiijii j  p  i ijji  p  i ???? ?? ??  ?? ??

The developed Multivariate Regression model has been tested with respect to ground level studies in both Kharif 2009 and Rabi season 2009-10 and validated in the subsequent Kharif 2010 and Rabi 2010-11 seasons along with ground level studies for forecasting of pest/disease incidences.

F.   Pest/Disease Decision Support System  Despite a growing awareness of the usefulness of various Information Communication and Dissemination Technologies (ICDTs) for precision agriculture, there is a concern about the limited availability of a real-time decision support system (DSS) with ubiquitous decision-making. This stimulated to      develop a real-time DSS for decision-making in dynamic precision farming system, particularly the precision protection (pest/disease) aspects. Real time DSS called GNPM-DSS, was achieved by integrating Information, Communication and Dissemination Technologies with open-source tools/techniques, WSN-based dynamic real-time crop, weather and environmental data/information.

Using data mining techniques and precision protection process models (written in PHP/JAVA scripts for web- enablement), a MySQL/PostgreSQL module (for structured query language, upload, and download and use by decision makers in their daily decision-making processes) was developed and has been extended to a real-time DSS (Fig 3.) for information, pest/disease simulation to the probable severity or a particular pest/disease and prediction services.

Apart from this, how and to what extent a vector pest (Thrips) can enforce seasonal influence to BNV disease severity and population growth was simulated so as to aware of their combined effect upon ground crop. Similarly, foliar/fungal disease RT/LS (though both are independent disease) impact on crop can be predicted (both independent as well as combine effect) so as to take appropriate decision as far are protection and/ or control measures is concerned.

Fig. 3: Structural Components of DSS   The proposed DSS is a two-way DSS that helps the user community to communicate and obtain the necessary information/scenarios/predictions/simulations using the developed precision protection models and advisory services in real time through the multimode ICT approach. It is also a multimodular query-based system that assists the rural extension/farming community in its ubiquitous decision- making.



III. RESULT AND DISCUSSION  A. Pest/Disease Dynamics Quantified results were obtained from the developed precision protection models/algorithms, which comprises evaluation of DM multilevel classifiers, hidden correlations (pest/disease- weather-crop age) from Association Rule mining, pest/disease dynamics and prediction models, gravitated to developing a  decision support system (Fig.  4) to assist the crop protection majors and farmers.

The correlation values (both positive & negative) of predictor (e.g. Tmax, RH1, ET, etc.) versus target (e.g. Thrips and BNV infection index) were obtained from various datasets (sensory, weather-station and surveillance) during flowering to harvesting stages and are depicted in Table 1 [22].  A correlation Index matrix was obtained by using RARM, in which correlation index of Thrips-BNV with      weather/environment parameters were quantified in the range of -1 to +1. Table 1 shows overall interpretation of correlation (Thrips/BNV/LS/RT/Weather/environment/ Crop Age) values with negligible, moderate and strong levels drawn from all four seasons.  Pest/disease risk models [5][16], based on the concept of infection index, has been modified by taking local conditions such as Temperature, Humidity, Leaf Wetness and ET, which plays an important role  in Semi-arid tropics. Thus, a correlation index greater than 0.5 in the scale of -1 to +1 has been considered as strong +ve, whereas -0.5 or more for strong negative correlation.

Fig 5. Correlation Index values for BNV with weather-crop-environment   Fig 6. Correlation Index Values for RT and LS  Based on the results obtained from correlation models, with all the four season data, it was found that Relative Humidity has strong positive correlation and AC has strong negative correlation with BNV. 80% or more RH2 with 7 to 8 hours of LW consecutively for 5 day with temperature of 30o to 36oC is the favorable for BNV infection. ET has strong positive correlation and AC has strong negative correlation with Thrips. In case of Thrips, ET, and AC found to be strongly correlated. Tmax, Tmin, RH1 and RH2, SH are also found to be positively correlated and others such as RD, RF, LW and WS are negatively correlated (Fig 5). It was also observed that there is a strong correlation with pest Thrips and disease BNV with an index value of 0.674 (for Kharif  2009), 0.519 (for Rabi 2009-10), 0.713 (for Kharif 2010), 0.548 (for Rabi 2010- 11),   respectively  [22]. This also implies that whenever Thrips incidence takes place there is a likelihood (of 50-70% chances) of BNV infestation.

It was found that RH1, RH2, LW, SH and AC have strong positive correlation while Tmin has strong negative correlation with RT.  In case of Leaf Spot, AC, LW, RH1 have shown strong positive correlation and Tmin has strong negative correlation (Fig 6). There is an increase in disease intensity with the period of high humidity as the latter favours abundant sporulation and germination of the spores of the pathogen, and in agreement with several researchers [25][26]. Rainfall,  Rainy days and Wind Speed found to be positively correlated (moderately) with RT but negatively correlated with LS. SH has a negative impact on LS, but positively correlated with RT and one of the important parameters that distinguish the cause of RT with respect to LS.

There is a strong correlation with LS and RT disease with an index value of 0.882 (for Kharif  2009), 0.525 (for Rabi 2009-10), 0.625 (for Kharif 2010), 0.812 (for Rabi 2010-11), respectively. This also implies that whenever Leaf spot disease incidence takes place there is a likelihood (of 60-80% chances) of RT infestation. It has been observed from all the four seasons with different dates of sowing that Rust incidence was followed by LS. Also, it has been found that RT infestation was seen one week after the LS infestation in Kharif season.

For both the diseases, one of the main parameters is Leaf Wetness (either due to rainfall in Kharif or dew factor in Rabi seasons followed by Humidity with an optimum temperature 20-250C. Longer Sunshine hour also plays an important role for rapid infestation of RT disease as compared to LS and could be the reason for more RT disease occurrence in Rabi season.

B. Predictions  As pest/disease infestation in crops is highly influenced by meteorological factors, the weather based modeling for early warning may provide appropriate tool for investigating and predicting pest/disease status and for control measures. With correlation studies revealing the crop-weather-disease relationships/ interactions, there is a possibility of developing early warning models (cumulative CWK and non-cumulative 1WK) on pest/disease infestations.

Two color schemes (light gray and dark grey) were followed as a warning and depicted in Tables 2 to 5   as a sample study for Kharif 2010season D2 sowing; similar predictions were also carried out in other sowing dates as well as Rabi season 2010-11. Light gray colour shows the pest/disease initiation and indicates control measures (biological, cultural, and mechanical control or chemical control) to be applied so as to reduce the disease incidence.

Multifold increases of pest/disease will be there if uncontrolled during this initial warning period. The dark gray colour indicates moderate to high damage of pest/disease.   At this stage, greater control in the form of mechanical or chemical are required to reduce the pest/disease infection.

Beyond the dark gray zone week, no control measures will save the crop, which will lead to economic loss.

Pest/disease Decision Support System Groundnut Pest Management DSS (GNPM-DSS) assist the  farming community with ubiquitous precision protection aspects on information and modelling services.   GNPM-DSS home page serves as pest/disease portal wherein information on various pest/diseases is described with their symptoms and corresponding action for protection or prevention measures. In addition, it also has useful photographs; experimental designs contact details, feedback forms, etc. However, if the user is interested in availing services (information and modelling), one needs to furnish login details.

1) Information Services:  This includes real-time AgriSens sensory information and weather station-based information as well as the collected surveillance information. A link is also provided to access/view meteorological data from various regional weather stations.  Each sensor (Mote) deployed in the field collects micro-level weather and its data in text mode (raw data).  These data are converted in to useful units (real data) in real-time and shown in appropriate structured format automatically.  The user can download the information using SQL queries and import the data in various OSC standard formats (CSV, Excel, XML, etc.).  In addition, this tool has the facility to upload user defined data so as to use the data for further analysis. Users can also obtain details about groundnut Pest/Disease (Thrips, BNV, LS and RT) symptoms, their life cycle and various control measures with respect to pest/disease infections severity.

Pest/Disease prediction simulation  2) Modelling Services: This serves to the user community to simulate pest/disease incidences and predictions of any week/stage of the crop. For example, Fig. 7 shows findings on 15/9/2010 (Kharif 2010 season) with 10 week old crop on Thrips (14.91%), Leaf Spot (50.99%), Rust (33.75%) and Bud Necrosis (44.25%) infection severity. Models developed with DM techniques are served as back-end. By using the developed cumulative (CWK) and non-cumulative (1WK) prediction strategies, the pest/disease can be simulated to a given weather/environment/user defined simulated data.  The user can enter weather data or the system can use week wise available data to simulate the predictions (Fig. 8). Sliding bars are provided so as provide smoother simulation of weather parameters.

Fig. 9  CWK -Rust  prediction simulation  A screen shot of CWK prediction for 10 week old Rust disease is show in Fig. 9 with corresponding weather parameters. User can also see the symptom of groundnut crop and control measure as per the simulation and severity of pest/disease. The control measures are described as per the advice for the records of Agro-met Cell [3].  Similarly, other pest/disease can also be simulated for predictions.



IV. CONCLUSIONS Interactions and hidden relationships between most  prevailing and interrelated groundnut crop pest/disease and dynamic weather parameters were quantitatively established with the help of WSN and DM techniques in conjunction with ground level surveillance data in a test bed falling in semi-arid tropics. Real-time micro-climatic parameters such as temperature, humidity and leaf wetness were obtained from Zigbee based AgriSens distributed sensing system, whereas the crop-weather-environment-pest/disease dynamics and hidden relations were quantified from various developed/ tailor-made DM techniques.

It has been observed that BNV infection dynamics are related to the presence of pest Thrips (which is a vector for the rapid BNV disease infection), similarly rust infection are related to leaf spot incidences. These quantified/mining based correlations through empirical and MVR model that has been used to issue the forecast (non-cumulative) for population buildup, initiation and severity of pest/disease. Apart from this, a cumulative prediction model also has been developed, which found to be more accurate than the non-cumulative strategy observed with two seasons data with multiple sowing dates.

This will help to take judicious ameliorative decisions so as to save the crop from infection and its subsequent effects on environment and crop yield. The developed GNPM-DSS is a user friendly system designed for novice users, which can also be used not only with the embedded sensory information and models but also can be used with the user-defined data/models.
