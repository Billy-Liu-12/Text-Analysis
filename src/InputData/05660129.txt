Study on farmers information technology adoption

Abstract: Through adopting advanced information techniques,  farmers can broaden their information acquisition channels,  reduce acquisition cost, and make rational production and  operation decisions of production, technology and market  information. Based on 117 survey questionnaires from Jiangxi,  Fujian and Anhui which have experienced the reform of  collective forest right system, this paper specifically takes call  centre, short message service (SMS) and network platform as  technique examples, establishes farmers information technology  adoption behavior mode, and then clarifies the impact of  farmers endowments on information technology adoption by  applying association rules. In a word, this paper will provide  some theory and method support not only to improve farmers  information technology adoption rate, but also to develop their  production and operation ability.

INTRODUCTION  Through adopting information technology, farmers can  broaden their information acquisition or issuance channels,  reduce information cost, and avoid economic loss caused by  lacking production price information, lacking supply and  demand information, and blind copying production strategies.

Therefore, study on farmers information technology adoption  behavior mode will improve the technology adoption service  for them and increase their economic profit. However, some  problems still exist: one aspect, China has put a large scale of  investment on building information infrastructure, processing  equipment and allocating personnel. Statistic data shows that  by the end of 2009, broadband had covered 96% of villages    and towns, and 91% of administrative villages could surf the  Internet. At the same time, 11724 information service stations  for the countryside spread in 11986 villages and towns of 14  provinces [1]. The other aspect, the farmers consider that the  information service effect is not obvious with its government  property. Instead of being used frequently, many facilities have  never been used, or have just rarely used [2]. What on earth  hinder the transformation of information techniques in rural  areas? What factors influence or even determine farmers  information technology adoption behavior? To improve the  information service, this paper studies both the key factors and  the behavior mode of farmers information technology  adoption based on behavior modeling theory.

Information technology adoption is a process of behavior  activity which involves thinking over environmental factors  (such as society, economy and technology) and individual  factors (such as psychology, and capability) to analyze, select,  introduce and apply information technology [3]. So far many  theory models have been put forward from broad, such as  Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), Theory of Planned  Behavior (TPB) and Innovation Diffusion Theory (IDT).

Standing out of these models, Technology Acceptance Model  (TAM) which was advanced by Davis and based on behavior  modeling theory, its ameliorated and extended forms have  always been the mainstream. The application of information  technology adoption models is concentrated on enterprises and  organizations. And it not only analyzes the inner reasons and  behavior logic which may influence the adoption results and  application effect, but also builds behavior models [3][4][5][6].

However, there are few studies in the field of farmers  information technology adoption.

The definition of the forestry farmers endowments, which is  quoted from FANG Song-Hais viewpoint, indicates the innate  and acquired resources and abilities of family members and  family situation. In detail, these resources and abilities mainly  involve both members endowments represented by the head of  a household, and the familys endowments represented by  other family members [7]. Currently domestic studies about  technology adoption and with breakthrough point of farmers  endowments have concentrated on the technological  characteristics, implemented environment and individual  behavior [8][9]. However, they dont attach knowledge barriers    which cannot be ignored in the technology adoption study.

Therefore, from the view point of farmers endowments and  developing from ZHANG Xins model[9] based on absorptive  capacity and adoption behavior intention, a farmers  information technology adoption model is established which is  on the basis of both absorption/adoption capacity and  absorption/adoption intention. In this paper, we have done  research on the farmers information technology adoption in  some important forestry provinces of South China, such as  Anhui, Fujian and Jiangxi. With the collected data about  adopting techniques of the call center, SMS and network  platform, this paper combines the methods of one-way  ANOVA and association rules (Apriori algorithm) not only to  demonstrate the influential factors and farmers adoption mode,  but also to offer information service departments proposals  The paper is sponsored by Beijing forestry university Scientific and  Technological Innovation Project ( BLRW200922 )  978-1-4244-7161-4/10/$26.00 2010 IEEE  which can be some theoretical references and basis for making  policies.

2. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION BEHAVIOR  MODEL BASED ON FARMERS ENDOWMENTS  Information technology adoption behavior includes both  capacity and intention. Cohen and Levinthal defined this  capacity as the organization or individual ability to digest,  absorb and use the value of external information, and then  improve their innovation capability[10]. Moreover, it is  influenced by personal experience, knowledge accumulation  & diversity, and some environmental factors like  domestication, economy, society and culture. Information  technology adoption intention indicates the organization or  individuals subjective willing which on certain degree reflects  people's perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. By  comparison, the former refers to an existence of ability from  the objective aspect, the latter is an attitude from the  subjective aspect. According to the definition of farmers  endowments, the adoption behavior includes farmers capacity  and intention. In detail, this capacity represented by the head  of a household can be separated into members capacity (such  as age , education, experience) and familys capacity (such as  financial condition, geographic position, information resources  and public relations). And in the same way, this intention can    also be separated into members capacity represented by the  head of a household (such as perceived usefulness, perceived  ease of use and perceived intention of use) and familys  capacity (such as attitude of families and neighbors ). (shown  as figure 1.)  3. ANALYSIS OF FARMERS INFORMATION  TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION BASED ON ASSOCIATION  RULES  We collected 117 questionnaires about three information  techniques adoption from Jiangxi, Fujian and Anhui province.

After preparing and preprocessing the data, we figure out the  key factors by analyzing the model factors, and then get the  mode and features of farmers information technology adoption  through association rules.

A. Data preparation and preprocessing  117 valid questionnaires were collected from Jiangxi,  Fujian and Anhui province. First, we will preprocess data as  follows to keep it integrity, avoid the noise influence and  remove data inconformity.

1) Data Cleaning. For some blank answers, the average  value or mode value is filled.

2) Data Integration. Data of attributes from the model is  integrated into a new database.

3) Data Reduction. Attribute value in the database was  discretized while continuous data was first divided into several  intervals and then discretized.

B. Impaction factors of farmersendowments on capacity and  intention of information technology adoption  The relationships between farmers endowments and  information technology adoption are figured out by one-way  ANOVA and checked by 2? analysis. The results are listed in  table 1.

Moreover,  perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and attitude of  neighbors to techniques affect farmers intention. Therefore,  the data mining of association rules behind will use these 9  factors to study farmers endowments impact on information  technology adoption behavior and their adoption mode.

C. Mode of farmers information technology adoption based  on association rules  1)  Association rules  Association rules are to look for the relationship among  different variables in the database, and find out the frequent  mode [11].

Definition 1: Let   be a set of n binary  attributes called items. Let transaction T be a subset of I,  i.e. I?T . Let  be a set of transactions  called the database. Each transaction in D has a unique  transaction ID. Let A be an itemset, and transaction T contains  A, i.e. TA ? .   .

Definition 2: A rule is defined as an implication of the form  BA? ?where IA ? , IB ? ,and ??BA ? . The sets  of items A and B are called antecedent (left-hand-side or LHS)  and consequent (right-hand-side or RHS) of the rule  respectively.

Definition 3 : When BA?  is a rule in database D, it has  to satisfy the minimum support S and minimum confidence C.

Support is defined as the proportion of transactions in the data  set which contains the itemset, i.e. )( BAPS ?= .

Confidence can be interpreted as an estimate of the probability  )|( ABP .

Association rules generation is usually split up into two    separate steps:  Step 1: minimum support is applied to find all frequent  itemsets in a database.

Step 2: these frequent itemsets and the minimum confidence  constraint are used to form rules.

2) Apriori algorithm  In 1994, Agrawal with other scholars worked out Apriori  algorithm. The core principle is that the subsets of a frequent  itemset are still frequent itemsets and the supersets of an  unfrequent itemset are still unfrequent. Moreover, Apriori is a  kind of iterative algorithm which is based on a two-stage  mining thought for frequent itemsets. In detail, Apriori uses a  "bottom up" approach, where frequent subsets are extended  one item at a time (a step known as candidate generation), and  groups of candidates are tested against the data. From L1 to Lk,  the algorithm terminates when no further successful  extensions are found. But one attention of Apriori is that when  searching for frequent subset Lk from Lk-1, connection and  pruning will be done in the process. And finally association  rules will result from the frequent itemsets[12].

3) Mining results by association rules  With software Weka3.5.8, some association rules between  three information techniques (call centre, SMS and network  platform) and farmers endowments have been mined out  under the condition of probability=0.5, confidence=0.4.

Therefore, some strong association rules with high confidence  have been listed typically in Table.2.

SMS = yes  0.545 0.424 Education = high, family income =  high, family communication cost =  middle ? SMS = yes  a) Call centre technique: Farmers tend to adopt this  technique while job=farmer, family communication channels  = middle, family communication cost = middle and family  income =middle. The association rules reflect weak relevance  between adoption and farmers age and education. And its  adoption is mainly because of the easy operation. However,  farmers are still afraid of getting fake information.

b) Network platform technique: Farmers tend to adopt this  technique while age = young, job = planting, breeding and  selling production, family income = high and public  communication channels = wide. The association rules reflect  strong relevance between adoption and farmers job, age and  family income. And its adoption is mainly because of the easy  operation and its timeliness. However, this technique costs  much.

c) SMS technique: Farmers tend to adopt this technique    while age=young, education=high, family communication  cost=middle and family income=high. The association rules  reflect strong relevance between adoption and farmers age  and education. And its adoption is mainly because of the easy  operation and its timeliness. However, farmers are still  worried about the attitude of neighbors around to their  behavior.

4.CONCLUSION AND SUGGESTION  From the mining results, we bring forward following  conclusions:  A. Build various communication channels and provide  differentiation information technology  Farmers who have few communication channels dont want  to adopt new techniques because of their limited family  economic ability. We suggest government should try to reduce  the risk and cost of technique adoption, promote various  communication channels with different charging standards or  provide some benefits of different degrees.

B.  Intensify farmers education and improve farmers  certification of techniques  Government should undertake some temporary training  courses to instruct farmers some new information technologies  for rural areas and let farmers be acquaint with these  techniques. In this way, first farmers certification and then the  information technology adoption rate will be improved.

C. Reduce technique cost and improve service quality  It will do well in the technique promotion when the  technique charging is lower and techniques are more various.

Moreover, considering that the service quality will influence  farmers technology adoption intention and behavior,  information service institutions should try to perfect the  quality through better satisfying farmers information  demands and more reducing service cost. In this way, farmers  information technology adoption will be promoted.
