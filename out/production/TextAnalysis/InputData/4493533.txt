Practical Inter-stock Dependency Indicators using Time Series and  Derivatives

Abstract  Prediction of stock prices is a difficult but extremely important problem that demands the development of algorithms for predicting trading opportunities by detecting patterns from past data. A related problem is the task of identifying inter-dependencies between different stocks, so that investment in one stock can be done when a related stock is performing well. The work till date on this problem seems mostly focused on theory or database techniques. We define three very simple indicators derived from stock data for this purpose, and show how they can be used in practice to successfully identify investor thumb rules in a quantitative manner.

Keywords: Stock market, stock value prediction, stock indicators, time series, inter-dependence.

1. Introduction.

According to efficient market hypothesis (EMH) [11], the price of a stock completely encapsulates all the information available, making it impossible to predict the movement of prices.

Algorithmic trading [13, 14, 15] is an attempt to address this problem. It involves the identification of the ?windows of opportunities? from the historical time series [12] stock data, for future stock prediction and financial decision making.

One interesting related problem is to find out how one stock affects another.  Here, we are trying to detect any kind of dependency between  two stocks.  It is quite important from the viewpoint of investors; as it gives some unforeseen insights.  Morris and Shin [17] showed that at normal times, the market probabilities are known and largely independent of investment decisions of different players.  In times of market stress, however, the players must try to gauge the psychology of others and therefore, re-compute the probabilities carefully.

Also, [18] showed that patterns in a stock are often psychologically perceived rather than truly existing, which makes it even more important to have a definite indicator that cross checks one stock against others.

It appears that not too many results on this problem exist.  There exist indicators for gauging a stock?s movement and strength and these are widely used in market.  See [1] for an easily accessible nice list, detailed descriptions can be found in [14, 16]. The indicators, Price Ratio and Price Comparison [1] do compare two stocks? prices, but this is for the purpose of finding strong stocks rather than dependences between stocks.

Gavrilov, Anguelov, Indyk and Motwani [2] used clustering techniques to group similar stocks, but their purpose was to study the effect of different similarity measures rather than finding the dependence between stocks; also, the idea of finding dependence between stocks require much more precision that usual clustering.  Mining association rules from database of transactions [3, 4] has also been used for finding rules from stock data [5], but though the rules discovered are     sometimes quite nice, the number of rules found is not too many, and also, not every pair of stocks can be examined for a possible dependence.

Similarity finding between time series from databases was introduced in [6, 7] and was extended in [8].  A similarity measure based on geometric properties for finding similar time series was defined in [9], and the results were further modified in [10].  However, to the best of our knowledge, attempts were not made to use these results into stock market data; moreover, these methods were complicated and could not provide simple yet practical indicators useful for investors.  Also, it is important to have indicators that can analyze dependencies easily to identify how one stock behaves after a few days of another stock?s growth or fall and can say if short-term dependencies differ from long term ones.  None of the techniques available do that.

Ours seems to be the first attempt to look into the any-pair problem from a practical point of view.

Our data set is taken from Standard and Poor 500.  This data shows daily price and volume fluctuations (opening price, closing price, maximum price, minimum price and volume) for some well-known stocks over a year. The details of the data set may be obtained from http://kumo.swcp.com/stocks/.

In this article we describe three simple indicators of dependence between stocks in sections 2, 3 and 4.  Section 5 compares the three indicators and Section 6 discusses their applications in predicting long term and short- term dependencies. Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper.

2. Indicator 1: Correlation Coefficient (CC) : Consider stock data for two companies, A and B.

We assume that both data sets are available for the same time points.  Then, intuitively, we can say that stock B data follows stock A data if, when A increases, B increases and when A falls, B falls.

This essentially implies that the scatter plot of A vs. B tends to follow a monotone function.

Statistically, we can say that stock B is dependent on stock A, if the correlation coefficient of data A and data B are high enough.

Note that this indicator is symmetric; A?s dependence on B is the same that of B?s dependence on A.

We give the correlation coefficients in Table 1.

The scatter plots are important together with correlation coefficients [19], but for lack of space we show only two example ones for opening stock prices over one year in Figures 1(a-b); others show a similar trend.  We consider the following statistical coefficients: Kendall?s? , Spearman?s ?  and linear correlation (Pearson?s R).  Similar patterns are obtained for closing price, maximum price, and minimum price.

The scatter plots and the coefficients reveal some interesting patterns.  IBM and MSFT do have a strong relationship and they tend to follow each other with a clearly proportional functional dependence.  MSFT and JNJ are somewhat randomly related (oriented along all directions), with no strong proportional dependence. Market intuition will endorse that Microsoft and IBM are strongly related, while Microsoft and Johnson and Johnson Drug Company are in different fields and are unlikely to affect each other in every movement.  Surprisingly, HOT and MSFT seem to be related to some extent; it is likely that MSFT doing well reflects the market?s strength and thus affects HOT too.  HOT and JNJ are in different fields and are unlikely to affect each other. AMD and IBM seem to have a negative relationship, which is expected given that these two are competitors.

Let us denote the time series of stock A as f(t) and that of B as g(t). Our aim is to find out if an increase or decrease in A?s price introduces an increase or decrease, respectively, in B?s price.

We call this situation ?B exactly follows A?. If an increase or decrease in A?s price introduces a decrease or increase, respectively, in B?s price, the situation is termed as ?B exactly opposes A?.

The following lemma gives us a very simple way to check if one stock exactly follows another.

LEMMA 1.  Consider two differentiable time series f(t), g(t).  Then g(t) exactly follows f(t), iff ? t , f?(t).g?(t)>0.                                              (1) where f? and g? denote the derivatives of f and g with respect to t, respectively.

Proof: f increases if f?>0, and decreases if f?<0.

Similar statement holds for g also.  Thus, at any time t, if both f and g are increasing, f?(t).g?(t)>0 ; and also if at any t  both f? and g? are decreasing, f?(t).g?(t)>0. Conversely, if  f?(t).g?(t)<0, then both  f?(t) and g?(t) must have the same sign and the lemma follows.  QED COROLLARY 1. )(tg  exactly opposes )(tf  iff  0)(').(' <tgtf .                                          (2) As we are dealing with a finite data time series (data given from time point 0 to some M ) and not explicit expressions of f  and g , we can simply use the forward difference as an approximation of the derivatives:  ? ? ?  ?=?+= ?=?+=  1,...0),()1(' 1,...0),()1('  Mnngngg Mnnfnff        (3)  And apply the above lemma.

However, this will be overly optimistic for two reasons.  We cannot expect B to follow A on all  data points; and we can?t expect B to follow A instantaneously.  Therefore, applying the lemma on matching data points may not be a good idea.

Instead, we can think of applying the lemma on the series )( Ttf +  and )( Ttg + , where T  is a fixed time shift.  Suppose we find that at some point, f is monotonically increasing over an interval of size T . Now if B is indeed dependent on A, then this steady window will start affecting B and B?s stock will start increasing. A similar thing will happen for fall.  Mathematically, we check for:  0)'(').'(' >++ TtgTtf ; when )(tf  monotone for t  in }',...1','{ Tttt ++  for a given T .        (4) That way we can check if B indeed follows A with a time lag.  Also, as we can?t expect B to follow A on all data points, we will simply check if the number of positive products is substantial.  Note that when 0>T , the relation ?B follows A? is not symmetric, and thus this indicator gives us more information than correlation coefficient.

Table 2 shows some results.  We have used the opening price of the stocks as the function values f(t) and g(t).  Note that the same technique may be used for other attributes like volume, or closing price; and each one of those may be a separate indicator.  It might be interesting to combine volume and price as a stronger indicator.  This study is in progress.

Let us denote the number of positive products by P and the number of negative products by N.

Let us compute the function R defined as:  ( )[ ] ? ? ?  ? ??  = otherwiseNP  NPifNPNPNP R  ),sgn(.2 0),min(,)sgn(.),min(/),max(  ???????????????????(5 )  Where )sgn( x  is the signum function and returns +1 if 0>x , -1 if 0<x  and 0 if 0=x .  Thus, R returns a positive number if P>N, a negative number if P<N and 0 if P=N. Note that R returns 0 for P=N=0.  We use the following scheme: Strongly following, if 2?R Good following, if 27.1 <? R Medium following, if 7.15.1 <? R Low following, if 5.10 <? R Low opposing, if 05.1 <?? R Medium opposing, if 5.17.1 ?<?? R Good opposing, if 7.12 ?<??

Lemma 1 only says that g(.) and f(.) are tied, but the extent is subjective, and will depend heavily on the market condition, investor risk, type of stocks etc.

We are using a data set that is spread over a fairly long time, so quick fluctuations can be assumed to be balanced and trends should be reasonably well established across all stocks.  Then, if a stock B indeed follows A, it should do that in most cases barring the abnormal local fluctuations and seasonal variations.  Overall trends should match.

For stocks that do not relate to each other at all, the probability of match at each local variation is 0.5, with no decision power.  Then the point estimate ),min(/),max( NPNP  is expected to stay close to 1.  So, to have a strong match, we assumed that the probability of a positive product is double that of a negative product, that is, about 0.66. Rest is done similarly, with probabilities of about 0.62 and 0.6 for Good and Medium.

As expected, zero lag (that is, where B exactly follows A) always show many positive products, though the ratio of positive to negative products is never very high.  This shows that no two stocks are really dependent on a day-to-day basis.

Interestingly, the number of cases where a stock increased or decreased continuously for 6 days is too few and therefore, should not be considered as statistically significant.  We will look at the 2-4 days lag. With a lag between 2 to 4 days, IBM follows Microsoft quite well, though Microsoft does not follow IBM that closely.  So, an IBM investor may do well when Microsoft is steadily gaining for 2-4 days; a Microsoft investor may use IBM gain/loss as an indicator but not that strongly.  However, GM?s or JNJ?s steady rise/fall may be a good indicator for Microsoft (but not vice versa, rows 3, 4, 5 and 6) Note how these results strongly support usual investor intuition.  Very well established companies in non-volatile market (like GM and JNJ) do not grow very rapidly or fall very fast and therefore any steady rise in them points to a strong market and a good trend, which affects every company positively.  So the results are indeed justified.  Note the curious fact that MSFT does not affect GM or JNJ that much, simply because MSFT can change fast for many reasons; and this is reflected quite well in the table.

Finally, IBM follows AMD weakly negatively though AMD follows IBM weakly positively.

CVX follows IBM strongly, and IBM follows CVX quite well.  JNJ and CVX do not have strong relationship at all.  This is in exact agreement with the correlation coefficients.  The results here often tally with the correlation coefficients, and give more information because of their non- symmetric nature    4. Indicator 3: Minimum/Maximum time window with pre-defined threshold amount change (MinTW- TAC/MaxTW-TAC).

In Section 3, we looked at the direction of change in the value of a stock over a time period, without considering the amount of change.  It may not be a good idea.  Let us try to illustrate this with an example. Suppose we find that MSFT is increasing monotonically over three days.  Then, by indicator 2 (SUG), we expect a stock dependent on MSFT to start increasing.  This may not be the case if the increase in MSFT is too slow or too low.  That is, the amount of change a stock has gone through is an important factor.   In fact, it can well happen that a stock goes through some fall during an overall rise, or some rise during an overall fall (when indicator 2 will not work); and these cases should be taken into account.  See Figure 2.

MSFT Opening Value   1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29 31 33 35 37 39 41 43 45 47 49 51  Day  Va lu  e     This makes us look at the total change amount.

So, if we start at day x, the changes on day x+1, x+2 and so on are added to find the total change.

When this exceeds a threshold, the time span is considered a viable window.  As this is the minimum length window starting from day x where such a threshold change has occurred, we call it a minimum time window with pre-defined threshold amount change (MinTW-TAC).

MSFT opening price variation dependent company?s stock should start showing a similar trend within this period, and we find its total change within the same window.  Note that we are not considering lag here: the idea is that if the change is sharp (say in a day), it would affect the other stocks immediately.  If not, the window is long enough and that is effectively simulating a lag.

Mathematically, we add up f?(t) till >= ? )(' xfF threshold.  Then, we check the value of ?= )(' xgG for the same window.  We check the direction of change of G, though other schemes can easily be implemented.  If G and F are of the same sign, we say that those two changes are related.

We have used the opening price of the stocks as the function values f(t) and g(t). Here too the same technique may be used for other attributes like volume, or closing price; and each one of those may be a separate indicator.  Another measure that we can use is the correlation coefficient between the values of obtained Gs and Fs.

We are checking the movements across time windows that cross a threshold.  At times, the trend continues in the same direction; for example, in Figure 2, window 15-18 shows a down-trend causing the threshold to be crossed, and in window 18-28 the down-trend continues, crossing the threshold one more time.  Then, price increases in window 28-35 with a threshold crossing.  In such cases, considering the entire period 15-28 can give a global picture.  This will give us the maximum time window with pre-defined threshold amount change (MaxTW-TAC), as this is the largest time window where the threshold change in one direction has occurred.

Table 3 gives some results.  We used a threshold of 1 (our stock data is in USD, and we assumed a change of 1 USD is substantial enough).   Dependence can also depend on the threshold, and changing the threshold may give some insights too; this issue has been considered in section 6.

We define a function R as before.  If P is the number of positive changes and N the number of negative changes, then  ( )[ ] ? ? ?  ? ??  = otherwiseNP  NPifNPNPNP R  ),sgn(.3 0),min(,)sgn(.),min(/),max(     ????????????..(6) Where )sgn(x  is the signum function and returns +1 if x>0, -1 if x<0 and 0 if x=0.  Thus, R returns a positive number if P>N, a negative number if P<N and 0 if P=N.  Note that R returns 0 for P=N=0.  We use the following scheme: Strongly following, if 3?R Good following, if 32 <? R Medium following, if 27.1 <? R Low following, if 7.10 <? R Low opposing, if 07.1 <?? R Medium opposing, if 7.12 ?<?? R Good opposing, if 23 ?<?? R Strongly opposing, if 3??R Note that we have changed the cutoff values here.

With amount change, companies have enough time to respond, and so panic fall or express rises are less expected.  That means the indicator must show stronger values to ensure dependence.

The heuristic justification for the ranges goes the same way as that of SUG.  Only, the probability is slightly more conservative because of the fact that in MinWT-TAC or MaxWT-TAC, the entire amount must change by a threshold.  So, we have lesser number of sample periods to use, and the investors will have more time to think and decide.  Therefore, we can say something with confidence only if the ratio is higher.  The probability of being a strong match is thus taken to be 0.75, a good match at 0.66 and medium match at 0.62.

From Table 3 it can be seen that IBM follows Microsoft extremely well, though Microsoft does not follow IBM that closely.  This is in exact match with indicator 2.  Indicator 1 also showed a high degree of correlation between IBM and MSFT.  GM?s or JNJ?s steady rise/fall may be a good indicator for Microsoft.

Table 3 shows that the other way is also true, though indicator 2 predicted a weaker association for GM/JNJ following MSFT.  JNJ does not follow HOT strongly.

HOT follows MSFT weakly, but MSFT follows HOT reasonably (indicator 2 predicted MSFT following HOT only weakly).  GM follows HOT to some extent, but not vice versa, matching indicator 2. IBM follows AMD more or less well though AMD follows IBM weakly. CVX follows IBM fairly well, and it strengthens over long term.  IBM follows CVX on a medium scale. JNJ and CVX do not have strong relationships, in fact, on long term; CVX tends to oppose JNJ though very weakly (same for correlation coefficient).

Comparison.

In Table 4, the three indicators are compared for pairs of stocks. Recall that the three indicators use different techniques and are therefore useful under different conditions.  CC is an overall measure.  SUG 2 day lag is an indicator that is useful for quick changes and not for long-term predictions.  SUG 4 day lag is slightly more conservative that SUG 2, but again, it is for short- term predictions.  MinTW-TAC?s are for long term predictions, with the MaxTW-TAC being the most conservative of all (we used a threshold of 1).

From Table 4 we make the following conclusions.

IBM follows MSFT under all schemes, and MSFT follows IBM under all schemes, albeit slightly weakly.

MSFT follows GM/JNJ moderately well under all schemes.  GM/JNJ does not follow MSFT on a short- term basis, but changes on long-term investments.

This matches investor intuition very nicely; as this means that the overall market trend is getting reflected in both stocks. HOT does not follows MSFT except for very short-term movements.  MSFT tends to follow HOT on long term, which can again mean a general trend match.  JNJ does not follow HOT at all.  HOT and GM does not follow each other at all.  IBM opposes AMD weakly on a short-term basis.  On long- terms, it follows AMD, which again may be just a reflection of general market trend.  AMD does not follow IBM across all schemes for this threshold.

However, with higher threshold, it starts showing a strong negative trend, in exact match with common investor intuition. CVX follows IBM quite well under all schemes.  IBM follows CVX well enough, but to a     lesser extent.  JNJ and CVX do not share any reliable relationship.

6.  Effect of Threshold on MinTW-TAC/ MaxTW-TAC.

We considered a threshold of 1 in our calculations for MinTW-TAC and MaxTW-TAC.  This may be somewhat conservative because of the fact that not all companies and investors consider 1 USD to be a sufficiently strong change. Therefore, some may decide to take action only if a large enough threshold is crossed. Thus, it is useful to study the effect of threshold.

Below, we give a few results for MinTW-TAC and MaxTW-TAC at different threshold values in figures 3(a-d).  The variable names are given this way: the first name is for stock A, the second is for stock B, and the third is min if we are looking at the minimum window, and max if we are looking at the maximum window.

Thus, ibm_amd_min implies that we are looking at MinTW-TAC and trying to determine if AMD follows IBM.

AMD?s dependence on IBM is random, with some long term opposing dependence with high threshold.  IBM?s dependence on AMD is low positive to begin with, but gets more and more opposing as threshold value increases.  That is, if AMD stocks gain heavily for a long-term basis, IBM stocks start going down.

MSFT mostly follows GM across all schemes for all threshold values.  GM follows MSFT on long-term basis.  Short-term basis is fluctuating.  Note that the R- values for threshold 5, 6 and 7 shows 0, but actually that means no change by that value ever occurred in MSFT stocks. It shows that study of threshold is an important idea.  At least in one case (AMD-IBM) it helped us understand the underlying opposing structures of the stocks.

Conclusion.

We have explored the problem of inter-stock dependence.  This is an important problem as this may help one understand the movement of individual company profiles in terms of some well-known stocks.

We described three practical dependence indicators based on time series, and showed that the results obtained match practical investor intuitions and can be used to detect dependence with time lag, with different stock value variations and for short-term and long-term predictions. The indicators successfully brought out investors? thumb rules in a quantitative way.  Note that the techniques described above talk about two stocks? dependence, and may be extended for three or more stocks, but with caution.  We used opening price as the basis of our calculation but similar indicators can be computed with other data like closing prices or volumes.  In fact, using the volume and price data together may be a good idea for dependency check.  In MinTW-TAC/MaxTW-TAC, we detected similarity based on the directions of amount change for both stocks; instead a correlation coefficient or threshold may give better results.  We wish to carry out our future research in the aforementioned directions.
