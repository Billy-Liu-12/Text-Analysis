Abstract? As e-commerce is becoming more and more popular, the number of customer reviews about a product grows rapidly.

So it is difficult for a potential customer to browse through large numbers of reviews for items of interest and make a decision about some products. In addition, for manufacturer, it's also difficult to keeping track product responses and mining the opinions from customer reviews, this is obviously unfavorable for improving products quality. To support some applications, we proposed a fine-grained approach to extract and summarize a general opinion and its strength based on features from customer reviews of a product. In this paper, we combine the LDA model and the association rules to extract the product features and the corresponding sentiment words of a product, and use cross- validation to prune the extract result. A completely unsupervised approach was used to calculating the strength of the sentiment words, and we rank all the reviews according to the strength, all the customer reviews are expression to the purchaser in the form of summary, the summary we propose is concise and concrete.

This paper proposes several novel techniques to perform these work, our experimental results show that these techniques are highly effective.

I.  INTRODUCTION As e-commerce technology becomes more mature, the  convenience of shopping online has attracted many customers.

In order to receive product feedback timely and to update future customers with previous shopping experiences of the same product, it is common for merchants to allow their customers to leave product reviews. As the internet becomes more convenient, increasing numbers of customers have chosen to leave their opinions. As a consequence, the number of reviews about a product grows rapidly. Potential customers find this troublesome as the number of reviews is too high, as they cannot find the necessary and helpful information fast enough. Manufacturers also suffer from this as it is difficult to keep track of customer opinions due to the large amount, and this will cause them to be at a disadvantage in its business competition. Due to the reasons above, our research project is of high importance and value nowadays.

In this research, we try to research the problem that generating fine-grained summaries of customer reviews of products sold online. Fine-grained means to extract the product features. Our task is divided into four steps to complete:  1. Identifying all the features of products that customers have commented on, according to the times they are evaluated by customers to rank the features.

2. Based on the first step, identifying the opinion word that the customers express their opinion on. In order to ensure that the opinion word is the reviews of the feature, we add some matching work.

3. Deciding the strength of opinion words. The strength is divided into three levels (strong/neutral/weak). According to the strength of the emotion, we rank the comments of the customers.

4. Generate summary. The summary is concise; thus it is easy for the user and the manufacturer to obtain the information they need.

Summary form as follows: Brand: Feature: Positive 216  strength 152    <individual reviews> neutral  50    <individual reviews> weak   14    <individual reviews>  Negative 15 strength  6    <individual reviews> neutral   2    <individual reviews> weak    7    <individual reviews>  Figure 1: An example summary In Figure 1, a total of 216 positive comments, among them  there are 152 comments that customers express a strong positive opinion, 50 of neutral, and 14 of weak. There are 15 that express negative opinions, among them 6 reviews expressed strong dissatisfaction, 2 of neutral, 7 of weak. From the summary, a potential customer can easily see how the exiting customers feel about the product, they can point the <individual review sentences> to the specific sentences, they can easily see why the customers like it, what are the advantages and disadvantages of the product. For the manufacturers, on one hand, they can know the features that the customers are dissatisfied about, so it will facilitate them in improving their products, on the other hand, they can easily know the information of the products that users are more concerned about through the summary.

Our project is different from the work of others [1,2,3,8].

First, we focus on the features that the customers commented on and identify the strength of the opinion. Second, the summary that we receive at last is structured and also includes statistical data. Section 3 is to present the detailed techniques for performing these tasks. A system, called FGS, has also been implemented. Our experimental results show that FGS     and the related technologies that are proposed in this paper are highly effective.



II. RELATED WORK The proposed techniques are closely related to Hu and Liu  on mining opinion features of customer reviews [4]. They work on customer reviews. They extracted product features which have been commented by customers, identified opinion sentences in each review, decided whether each opinion sentence was positive or negative, and summarized the results.

The system they proposed selects frequent terms and then extracts frequents by measuring the similarities between selected. The main problem of this method is that the system only considers the information from the term itself, which does not reflect the relationship between a feature and its related opinion information. Our work is different from theirs in two main aspects: (1) we are not only deciding whether each opinion is positive or negative, and we are deciding the strength of sentiment words. The strength is divided into three levels (strong/neutral/weak). According to the strength of the emotion, we rank the comments of the customers. (2) They focused on finding explicit features, and didn't give the method in extracting implicit ones, but in this paper we propose a model that can mine the implicit features of customer reviews.

Lawrence and David developed a method to automatically distinguish between positive and negative reviews. Their classifier drew on information retrieval techniques for feature extraction and scoring, and the results for various metrics and heuristics vary depending on the testing situation [5]. Our work is very different from theirs, we aim to identify the strength of reviews automatically, and rank them. We use association mining to find all explicit features, usually a set of words or a phrase that occur together in some sentences. And we use LDA model to capture aspects not explicitly rated by the user.

In[6], Aciar proposed a feature extraction method for opinion mining that uses an ontology, the main problem of their method is the maintenance of the ontology to address the constant expansion of the review data, they need to construct and update the ontology when new features are added. In addition, the system application is not flexible, a concept that is not defined in the ontology is not able to be classified. So it?s necessary to construct an automatic system to solve these problems.

In[7] , Jeong proposed an enhanced feature extraction and refinement method that effectively extracts correct  features from review data by exploiting both grammatical properties and semantic characteristics of feature words and refines the features by recognizing and merging similar ones. Similarly, they focus on feature-based opinion mining, in which the task applies to the sentence level to discover details about which aspects of a sentence level to discover details about which aspects of a product people felt bad of good. Their method called feature extraction and refinement for opinion mining(FEROM).They proposed a good method to splitting a compound sentence into multiple sentence. This method worked well semantically. They focus on consider the relationship between a term and its related opinion information and merge words with the same or similar meanings. They  don?t calculate the strength of the opinion word and propose a specific form of a summary. In this paper, we proposed a method that calculate the strength of the opinion and grade the strength into six grades, it?s easy for user to learn characteristics of the product.

In[8], they propose a major departure from the previous approaches by making two linked contributions. First, they assume that the sentiments are related to the topic in the document, and put forward a joint sentiment and topic model, i.e. Sentiment-LDA.  Second, they observe that sentiments are dependent on local context.  Thus, they further extend the Sentiment-LDA model to Dependency-Sentiment-LDA model by relaxing the sentiment independent assumption in Sentiment-LDA. The sentiments of words are viewed as a Markov chain in Dependency-Sentiment-LDA. This method worked well. Our method is different from theirs, we combine the LDA model and the association rules to extract the product features and the corresponding sentiment words of a product, then use cross-validation to prune the extract result. A completely unsupervised approach was used to calculating the strength of the sentiment words, all the customer reviews are expression to the purchaser in the form of summary concisely.

In each review context, there are some product features and sentiment words, in this paper each feature or a sentiment word represents a topic, we use the language of text collections through the paper, referring to entities such as ?words?, ?documents? and ?corpora?, this is useful in that it helps to guide intuition, particularly when we introduce latent variables which aim to capture topics. In this paper, each customer review represents a document, all the reviews about a product is form a set of corpora. Formally, we define the following terms:  A word is the basic unit of discrete data, a document is a sequence of N words denoted by w=( nwwww ,,,, 321 ),  where nw is the nth word in the sequence.

?A corpus is a collection of M documents denoted by D={ mdddd ,,,, 321  }.



III. THE LDA MODEL In statistics, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a  generative model that allows sets of observations to be explained by unobserved groups that explain why some parts of the data are similar [9]. In LDA, each document may be viewed as a mixture of various latent topics, where each topic is characterized by a distribution over words.

Given the parameters ? and ? , the joint distribution of a topic mixture ? , a set of N topics z, and a set of N words w is given by  ),|()|()|(),|,,(  ???????? nnn N  n  zwpzppzp ? =  =   (1)                  Figure 2: graphical model representation of LDA.

Where  )|( ?nzp  is simply i?  for the unique i such that 1=inz . Integrating over ?  and summing over z, we obtain the  marginal distribution of a document:  ( ) ( ) ??????? dzwpzppwp N  n z nnn  n  ? ?? ?? ?  ? ?? ?  ? =  =1  ),|()|(|,|     (2)  Finally, taking the product of the marginal probabilities of single documents, we obtain the probability of a corpus.

According the transform, we can also obtain the probability of topics:  ( ) ( ) d N  n z dndnddnd dzwpzppDp  d  n  ??????? ? ?? ?? ?  ? ?? ?  ? =  =1  ),|()|(|,|     (3)  As the figure makes clear, there are three levels to the LDA representation. The parameters ? and ? are corpus-level parameters, assumed to be sampled once in the process of generating a corpus. The variables d?  are document-level variables, sampled once per document. Finally, the variables  dnz and dnw  are word-level variables and are sampled once for each word in each document.



IV. THE PROPOSED TECHNIQUES  A. Features Generation We use LDA to find features that people are most interested  in. It posits that each customer review is a document, and each document is a mixture of a small number of topics and that each word?s creation is attribute to one of the document?s topics. In order to ensure the accuracy of the process, we use association rule [7] mining all features. Cross-validation the results with previous results, if the word or the phrase that occurs in the two mining results, we regard it?s a feature that customers are interested in. Then we need to identify sentiment word, these are words primarily use to express subjective opinions. Similarly, we need to find sentiment word that customers express their opinions about the product features, we use the same method, first we use LDA to find all the sentiment words, then we use associate rule to mining the nearby adjective for each feature in the sentence, at last, in order to improve the precision, use Cross-validation to remove the incorrect match.

For example, ?overall this is a good camera with really good picture clarity?, good is the effective opinion of picture clarity. Effective opinions will be useful when we predict the strength of opinion sentences. But, sometimes the opinion word is not the effective opinion of the feature, with our method, we can remove the incorrect one, for example, we get the set of features about the topics and the set of sentiment words through LDA and associate rule respectively:  Where { }nfffff ,,,, 321= represents the set of features, { }naaaas ,,,, 321= represents the set of sentiment words. We get a match that ?? 211 ,, aaf  through association rule, but in LDA, a1 is not exit, so the correct match is ?? 21 , af , and if we get a match ?? 211 ,, aaf in LDA, according to associate rule, we can get the correct match ?? 11 , af . The experiment results in section 5 confirm that our method is effective.

B. Predicting the strength of the Opinion words In this paper we focus on the corpus formats that the  reviewer is asked to give the grade in five stars and also write a detailed review, Jingdong.com uses this format. The web provides customers 10 levels of 5 stars to express the emotional intensity. We propose a method to calculate the strength of the sentiment words, we define the following terms: the number of all comments is n, { }tgggg ,,, 21= represents reviews grades, { }tssss 21 ,=  is the times that sentiment word appear in each grade, the corresponding weight is  { }tw wwww ,1= We obtain the sentiment strength calculation formula of  sentiment word:  ( ) n sss  w n sw  n sw  n s  words t  t t  ? ++  ?+?+? =     (4)  we use an example to illustrate our method, suppose that we want to predict the strength of ?helpful? in the corpus, helpful occur total100 times, 10 times in 5 stars (weight is 10), 5 times in 4.5 stars (weight is 9), 8 times in 2.5 stars (weight is 5), 1 times in 0 star (weight is 0), so we can obtain the strength of helpful:  8.8100      )( =? +++  ?+?+?+? =helpfuls      (5)  The result 8.8 is the strength of helpful, With this method we can obtain all the strength of the sentiment words, we divide the emotional intensity into six levels: positive(strength(9-10) ? neutral(8) ? weak(6-7))  and negative(strength(0-1) ? neutral(2-3)?weak(4-5)). We also consider whether there is a negation word such as ?no? ?not? ?yet?, appearing closely around the opinion word, if so the opinion orientation of the sentiment word is the opposite of its original orientation, such as ?the telephone is not easy to use?.

?  ?  ?  w  ?     C. Summary generation After all the previous steps, we ready to generate the final  fine-grained summary of reviews, all features are ranked according to the frequency of their appearances in the reviews.

The following shows an example summary for the feature ?call quality? of a cell phone, the individual opinion sentences can be hidden using a hyperlink in order to enable the user to see a global view of the summary easily:  Product name: Samsung Galaxy SIII Feature: call quality Positive:11 Strength:9  The call quality, Music player, camera quality excel every existing phone on earth.

Call quality is very good.

The call quality is great and i haven't had a dropped  call yet.

The call quality lives up to Samsung's past  reputation. I found that the sound was crisp, the volume range was impressive, and the signal didn't fade a bit.

? neutral   2  My main concerns were call quality, app speed and battery life, the Galaxy SIII excels at all three.

Call quality is good.

Weak   0 Negative 2 Strength: 0 Neutral: 2  There will be a slight noise during a long time call.

The cell phone may be a little hot after a long time  use, if you call this time will have a sight echo.

Weak 0

V. EXPERMENTS We have conducted experiments on the customer reviews  of five products: Samsung Galaxy SIII, Dell laptop, Canon camera, iPod and rice cooker. According to the above research, a system called FGS (Fine?Grained Summarization) has been implement in Java. The websites where we collected the reviews are 360buy.com and dangdang.com. Many customer purchase products on them, so there are a large number of reviews. For each product, we first crawled down and down loaded 200 reviews, these review documents were then cleaned to remove HTML tags, then we use LDA and associate rule to extraction feature and opinion word.

For evaluation, we manually read all the reviews and tagged a large collection of reviews. For each product, we produced a manual feature list, table 1 gives all the precision and recall results. We compare the features generated using our method with [4], we found that our precise improved by 6 percentage points. We use this method to extraction opinion words, two cross-validation approaches were used, first we use LDA model to obtain all the opinion words, then we use the result of associate rule validation, On the other hand, our system can calculate the strength of sentiment words automatic based on the proposed techniques above, then we used 120 reviews as train set, 80 as test set, for classifying the sentiment  into six level that we mention in IV. Table 1 shows the evaluation results of the two procedures: feature extraction, opinion extraction and sentiment strength prediction.

To further illustrate the effectiveness of our feature extraction, we compared the features generated using our method with the experiment result of Hu [4], their results are presented in Table 2, they conducted their experiments using the customer reviews of five electronics: 2 digital cameras, 1 DVD player, 1 mp3 player, and 1 cellular, the reviews were collected from Amazon.com and C|net.com. It can be observed that both the average recall and precision are lower than those of our method, the average accuracy in product features extraction is 84.8%. The average precision of opinion words extraction is 77.4%, our result analysis indicates that people often mention the situation in which they used the product, the detail of product features, and also the results they got, we can also extract the product features, and according to the result we can decide the sentiment orientation.

Our system has a good accuracy in predicting the strength of opinion words: the average accuracy for the five products is 91%, this shows that our method are highly effective.

After a close inspection of the terms generated by their research, we see that there are two major reasons that lead to the improving. First of all, our method integrates LDA and associate rule to mining product features and sentiment words, use cross- validation to improvement the extraction accuracy.

They only use associate rule in these two steps. Our method is better. Secondly, a new method is proposed to predicting the orientations of opinion words (see IV,B).

In summary, we can see that our techniques are very usefully, we believe that they may be used in practical use.

VI. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we proposed a set of techniques for extracting  text to be displayed in sentiment summaries. We combined the method of LDA and associate rule, and improved the accuracy by cross-validation. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed techniques are very promising in performing the tasks. We not only predict the orientations of opinion word, but also calculate the strength. The summary is not only useful to common customers, but also crucial to product manufactures.

The primary area of future work is to improve the method of calculate the strength of sentiment words and use our summarization system end to end in practice.
