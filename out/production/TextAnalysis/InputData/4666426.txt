Multi Relational Mining in Network Intrusion Detection

Abstract   The network intrusion detection (NIDS) is faced with the question to detect many kinds of intrusion. In order to detect the complex attack, Network Intrusion detection system need to analysis massive data captured form different network safety equipments. So a new multi relational mining algorithm MRA2 is proposed. MRA2 depend on the association rules mining technology and the probability function dependency method which is proposed through extending the theory of function dependency. MRA2 is able to synthesize the various datalog resources to detect intrusion effectively and reappear to the complex network attack scenario.

1. Introduction   Recently years, many researches study the alert  correlation methods to enhance the efficient of NIDS [1], [2], [3]. These methods mainly to analysis the meta-alert rules only from the NIDSs selves.  But for complex network attack, the attack behaviors are usually stepping stone, levity and synthetically [4]. In order to detection intrusion and reappear to the attack scenario, NIDSs need to analysis various datalog captured form various network safety equipments at different time. Usually, these various datalog are multi relations. For example, one attack maybe tracked in system log, router log and firewall log which related with the same IP address.

This paper proposes a multi relational mining (MRM) algorithm called MRA2. Based on the association rule mining and the probability function dependency (PFD) we proposed, MRA2 is capable to correlate, explain and analysis to the different information resource to confirm cause relationships among data recorders, and find attack or reappear to the network attack scenario.

2. Multi relational association rules mining  Association rule data mining (ARDM) is the  foundation contents of the data mining. By the knowledge expression methods, ARDM algorithms may be classified into tow kinds, single relational (single table) propositional logic and multi relational (multiply tables) first order logic [5]. Currently, the first kind algorithm has been studied deeply. They have been applied in many areas include IDS. Howevre, the relational database is the popular data format in the real world. The attack evidence is from multi relational resource also. But the algorithm based on single relational propositional logic will lead to the problem of information losing, the massive linked information, and the statistical base when they apply to the multi relational mining directly, they can?t deal with these problems well [6].

In 1997, Toivonen and Dehaspe proposed the first MRM?s algorithm WSRMR [7] based on ILP and Apriori. Then, Nijssen and Kok propose a more efficiently algorithm FARMER [8]. Clare propose RARAR algorithm with little limitation to memory.

But all these algorithms are based on ILP technology.

They can?t to be applied to traditional relational database mining directly.

In fact, people usually have some prior cognition to the function dependency (FD) of the attributes in the relational data set. Function dependency relationship is an important component of database normalization theory. It has a mature Armstrong theory system already. FD analysis theory and methods can observably improve the analysis efficiency to the relational database. Comparing with the association rule mining, we discover that this mining so called is to search a probability function dependency (PFD) relationship between the couple of attribute and value.

If we can say that the FD is one of PFD with 1 distribute probability value, the association rule mining will discover some PFDs for the couple of attribute and value with the distribute probability value between 1 and support.

DOI 10.1109/FSKD.2008.505     For example in a database table from David Hand and Heikki Mannila [9].

Table 1. Shopping basket data table (HTB)  Basket-id A B C D E T1 1 0 0 0 0 T2 1 1 1 1 0 T3 1 0 1 0 1 T4 0 0 1 0 0 T5 0 1 1 1 0 T6 1 1 1 0 0 T7 1 0 1 1 0 T8 0 1 1 0 1 T9 1 0 0 1 0 T10 0 1 1 0 1   David Hand set support to 0.4, the frequent two item set is {AC} and {BC}, and the mining rules are:  67.0,4.0, ==? confidenceSupportCA 1,4.0, ==? confidenceSupportCB  We will analysis this example with FD theory next.

Obviously, we have:  FD (HTB) = {Basket-id ?A, Basket-id?B, Basket-id?C, Basket-id?D, Basket-id ?E}. Here, FD (HTB) is a FD set with 1 probability.

Then, we define PFD as: Definition 1. Let R (U) be a relation pattern, X and  Y are the subset of the attribute variables set U. The PFD is a predicate with format YX P??? , if r is the current relation of R, for arbitrary two instances t and s of r, t[X] =s[X] implicates t[Y] =s[Y] in P probability.

Then, the PFD YX P???  comes into existence in relation pattern R (U).

Here, t[X] denotes the value of instance t in variable set X. The concept of instance is the same of truple in relation database theory.

According the definition, we have a PFD set: FD1(HTB)={ BA ??? 2.0 , CA ??? 4.0 ,  DA ??? 3.0 , EA ??? 1.0 , CB ??? 5.0 , DB ??? 2.0 , EB ??? 2.0 , DC ??? 3.0 , EC ??? 3.0 , ED ???0 }.

In order to simple the problem, we only consider the single attribute. Thus, correspondingly the decided factor set in the database normalization theory, the frequent set of association mining is the same as probability decided factor set. Obviously, when we also set the probability threshold be 0.4, we obtain the same results as reference [9]. On the other hand, the key Basket-it of the table couldn?t belong to the frequent set. Because the support of the key is equal to  1/n, and support=1/n will tend to 0 when n become very massive.

So we can say, FD should be consider in database design, it?s a storage definition to the already knowledge. The association mining should mine the new knowledge hidden in PFD.

3. PFD theory analysis   In this section, we propose a probability function  dependency (PFD) methods.

Definition 2. Let F be the set of PFDs. The set  which all element implicated by F is called clouser of F and signed with F+.

F+ ={ YX P???  | YXF P??? }  Theory 1. If {A1, ? ,An} was the attribute variables set of relation pattern R, the sufficiency and necessary condition which ???PX A1, ? ,An comes into existence is i  P AX ???  ( i=1, ?, n ).

Definition 3. Let F be the PFDs set on attribute set  U, X be a subset of U, and then the clouser of X signed with X+ denotes the set which all element Ai are  satisfied i P AX ???  and reasoned with the inference  rules. It can be expressed as following equation: X+ ={Ai| i  P AX ??? ? F+} Algorithm 1. To resolve the clouser X+ of attribute  variable X on F.

Input: The attribute variables set U of relation  pattern R.

The probability function dependency F on U.

The subset of X.

Output: the clouser X+ of attribute variable X on F S1: i=0, X (i)=X; S2: In F, searching the unused element which the  left item is the subset of X (i): Yj?Zj (j=1,?k), Yj ? X (i); In Zj , searching the attribute variable set A not  emerged in X(i) , let X (i+1)=X (i) A. If no such A then loop S4.

S3: IF X (i+1)=X (i) Then loop S4 otherwise loop S2.

S4: input X (i),  that is X+.

In algorithm, there are four quit conditions for step  S3.

? X (i+1)=X (i).

? When X (i) includes all attribute variables.

? In the left item of every PFDs in F, we can?t  find any attribute variable not emerged in X (i).

? In unused attribute variable set of the left item  of each PFDs in F, there are no subset of X (i).

Definition 4. Suppose there two PFD sets F and G on relation pattern R (U), if F+ =G+, then F and G are called an equivalence PFD set and signed with F?G.

Theory 2. Suppose F is a PFD set on relation pattern R (U). Fmin is the minimum PFD set if Fmin was satisfied the following four conditions:  ? Fmin+ =F+.

? The right item of every PFDs is a single  attribute variable.

? There are no redundant attribute variables in the  left item of every PFDs. That is to say, if X had a proper subset W made F-{ YX P??? 1 } ?{ YW P??? 2 } equal to F, then there are inexistence PFDs YX P??? 1  in F.

? There are no redundant PFDs in Fmin. That is to say, there are no such probability function dependence YX P??? 1  made F equal to {F- { YX P??? 1 }}.

Obviously, each PFD set at least exists a minimum PFD set if Fmin, and F?Fmin.

Algorithm 2. To resolve the PFD set Fmin of F.

Input: A PFD set F.

Output: The minimum PFD set Fmin.

S1: Appling the resolution rules in F, make the left  item of every PFDs simplification.

S2: Checking the non single attribute PFDs of left  item one by one in F, take out the redundant attribute variables of left item of every PFDs.

S3: Taking out the redundant PFDs. That is to say, taking out the first PFDs supposed as YX P??? 1 in F, and resolving the X+ in remain PFDs. If X+  includes Y, then takes out YX P??? 1 , otherwise keeps it.

4. MRA2 algorithm   MRA2 mines in the primary alert table through  computing the couple of attribute and value in a low probability threshold T1 firstly. Then, it merges primary alert to meta-alert.

For multi resource of the IDS, MRA2 use the alert aggregation method to merge primary alert to meta- alert based on attribute similarity and context required.

The format of primary alert is: (AlertID, Classificaton, SrcIP, DseIP, detectime, hyperID), the format of meta- alert is (HyperID, Classification, SrcIP, DesIP, StartTime, EndTime, Count). The process of alert aggregation shall remove the repeat alerts and result the meta-alert remained the importance information granularity. Each meta-alert has a one-to-many  relationship with the primary alerts. In primary alert, ?Count? field records the numbers of primary alerts merged into meta-alert. ?HyperID? field records the unique identification code of the meta-alert it merged into. Meta-alert aggregation algorithm is based on Leader-Follower model [10].

Through combines the results to mine with algorithm 1 and 2 in meta-alert table, MRA2 mines the rules with higher threshold T2. It looks like the hierarchy mining in someway. The difference is MRA2 mining with probability function dependency methods we proposed.

5. Experiment and analysis   We use DARPA2000 dataset for intrusion scenario correlation evaluation which is used to experiment compared with different intrusion detection methods [11]. The computer is DELL OptiPlex GX280, and the OS is Windows Vista in experiment.

2000 DARPA intrusion detection scenario specific data sets are presented by MIT Lincoln Laboratory. It contains data packets monitored in DMZ and Inside by Tcpdump. It has LLDOS1.0 and LLDOS2.0.2 two attack scenarios. In LLDOS1.0, attacker compromise the three hosts of Eyrie AFB utilizing Solaris sadmind vulnerability, upload the Mstream and attack a government Web site in DDoS method. LLDOS2.0.2 is similar to LLDOS1.0. However, the host vulnerability searching and Mstream uploading are stealthier than those in LLDOS1.0. Consequently, when the underlying intrusion detection system has vulnerability, we can verify the algorithm effectively.

We test two datasets in the same environment as the alert correlation algorithm proposed by [12], the results shown in table 2 narrate our algorithm improves the detection rate and the false alert rate.

Conclusion  We know that the first widely DDoS attacking  cause the research to alert correlation analysis technology in 2000. It clusters the alerts from the same     IDS according to the similarity of the alert attribution values in the early [13]. This method can?t reveal the causality among the alert information. Further more, researchers studies the intrusion event correlation method [14]. It extends the detection objects of IDS especial to the huge switching network system.

Recently years, for complex attack in Internet, a graphics method, called reconstruction attack scenario [15] or attack graph [16], is proposed to narrate the attack process. In fact, these kinds of algorithms are to construct the correlation graphic of hyper alert based on data fusion technology, the scenario so-called refers to the correlation graphic in deed.

In this paper, we present an algorithm that is able to detect complex intrusion effectively. But we not consider the time influence for multi relational datalog; it will be studied in our further research work.
