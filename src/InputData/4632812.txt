Previous research on CMEs, such as [7-9], The aim is to identify patterns of associations that reported that most CME events are associated can be represented using SVM learning rules to somehow with eruptive filaments/prominences and/or enable real-time and reliable CME predictions. The solar flares.

NGDC filaments catalogue and the SOHOILASCO The exact degree of association is not clear CMEs catalogue are processed to associate filaments because most of the available studies were carried out with CMEs based on timing and location on a few years of data or on limited cases and using information. Automated systems are created to physics-based modelling. In some cases, contradictory process and associate year~' of filaments and CME findings were reported. For example, not all data, which are later arranged in numerical training researchers agree that strong relationships exist vectors and fed to machine learning algorithms to between CMEs and filament/prominence eruptions. In extract the embedded knowledge and provide [10] it was found that the association rate was about learning rules that can be used for the automated 30% only. On the other hand, it was reported in [11] prediction of CMEs. Features representing the that more than 94% of the considered CMEs were filament time, duration, type and extent are extracted associated with eruptive prominences/filaments. This from all the associated (A) and not-associated (NA) means that the exact degree of association is one ofthe filaments and converted to a numericalformat that is long standing problems in solar research and it is the suitable for machine learning use.

2008 5th International Multi-Conference on Systems, Signals and Devices  Figure 4 Location-based CME-Filament association  Using these criteria we can associate the filament of Figure 1 and the CME of Figure 2 as follows:  ? The filament is reported on 19 Jul 2001, started at 9:40 and disappeared at 10:15. The CME is first recorded on the same day at  CMEs in this region are not  associated with the shown filament  Different stages are involved in this system, as shown in Figure 3. A C++ platform was created to automatically associate CMEs in the SOHO/LASCO catalogue with filaments in the NGDC solar filaments catalogue. The association is determined based on their timing and location information; the date and time for every CME is compared with the date and time for every filament. In addition, the Central Position Angle (CPA) for every CME is compared with the polar position for the centroid of every filament.

Our algorithm starts by parsing the CMEs and filaments catalogues. An associated filament is labelled "A" and a not-associated filament is labelled "NA" as explained below:  ? If a CME is not recorded "0." minutes before or after the time a filament disappears, then this filament is labelled NA.

? Otherwise, if the CPA for the recorded CME is located within ?30? of the centroid of the filament, as shown in Figure 4, then this filament is labelled A [17].

In our previous work [12-14], we designed computer vision systems to analyse the associations between solar flares and sunspots and also between flares and CMEs. Our previous work is extended here to carry out a large-scale analysis for years of solar catalogues data to investigate the associations between CMEs and eruptive filaments/prominences. We also aim to propose an automated machine-learning based system to provide a new perspective for the efficient prediction of CMEs, which is a long standing problem in solar physics . Data from the publicly available filament catalogues, which are provided by the National Geophysical Data Centre (NGDC) [15], are used in this study. The CME data are obtained from the CME catalogue that contains all CMEs manually identified since 1996 from the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) [16], which is generated and maintained by the Centre for Solar Physics and Space Weather at the Catholic University of America. This catalogue is constructed using the SOHO data in cooperation with the Naval Research Laboratory and the Solar Data Analysis Centre (SDAC) at NASA Goddard Space Flight Centre.

This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the design of the Computer Platform system for CME Predictions. The practical implementation and evaluation of the system using machine learning algorithms is discussed in Section 3. Concluding remarks and recommendations for future work are presented in Section 4.

2. The Computer Platform Design for CME Predictions In this work we introduce a computer platform  that analyses all the available years of data in the filaments and CME catalogues and defines its learning rules to provide automated predictions for CMEs.

2008 5th International Multi-Conference on Systems, Signals and Devices  10:30 (15 minutes after the disappearance of the filament).

? The filament is centred at S20W59, which produces an angle of 251? when converted to polar coordinations. The CME has a central position angle of 275? which falls within the filament association region (see Figure 5).

Hence, this filament is labeled as associated (A) filament.

Figure 5 CME-Filament association example.

After finding all the associations, a numerical dataset was created for the machine learning algorithms using all the associated and not-associated filaments.

In this work, all the CME and filament data for solar cycle 23 in the period from January 1996 until the end of December 2006 were processed, analyzing data relating to 11657 CMEs and 8765 eruptive filaments/prominences.

To explore the different levels of association, the association algorithm was applied with different values of a, as shown in Table 1.

Table 1 Levels of association based on the values of a  a (minutes) 120 180 240 300 Associated filaments 928 1168 1396 1613 Associated CMEs 651 841 1009 1147 Distinct associations 70.2% 72.0% 72.3% 71.1%  As shown in Table 1, different values of 0.

produces different levels of associations. The highest distinct associations percentage (without repeated associations) was obtained for a = 240 minutes.

By applying the association algorithm, with 0. = 240 minutes, an associated data set consisting of 2776 filaments with 1396 A filaments and 1380 NA filaments is created. Because machine learning algorithms deal mainly with numbers, it is essential that appropriate numerical representations for A and  NA filaments are proposed and implemented.

Properties such as starting time, ending time, location, type and extent of the filaments can be extracted from the NGDC filaments catalogue. We tried to include more features but unfortunately a large number of the associated filaments do not have detailed locations for both ends. Hence, it was decided to use the properties shown in Table 2.

As it was not clear which properties are more important for machine learning and for the prediction ofCMEs it has been decided to carry out extensive experiments in order to determine the significance ofeach property for our application.

3. Practical Implementation and Results After creating the associated data set, we have  started the training and testing experiments for the machine learning algorithms. These experiments and the evaluation of prediction performance are explained below.

3.1 THE LEARNING ALGORITHM The present study has used Support Vector  Machines (SVMs) which have proven to be very effective learning algorithm for similar applications [13]. All the machine learning/training and testing experiments were carried out with the aid of the Jack- knife technique [18]. This technique is used to provide a correct statistical evaluation of the performance of a classifier when implemented on a limited number of samples. The technique divides the total number of samples into two sets: a training set and a testing set.

In practice, a random number generator is used to decide which samples are used for training the classifier and which are used for testing it. The classification error depends mainly on the training and testing samples used. For a finite number of samples, an error counting procedure can be used to estimate the performance of the learning algorithms [18].

In this work, all the experiments were carried out using 80% randomly selected samples for training and the remaining 20% for testing. The CME prediction performance is evaluated using ROC curves, as explained in [19].

Two performance indicators are used: the True Positive (TP) rate and the False Positive (FP) rate. TP    2008 5th International Multi-Conference on Systems, Signals and Devices  is the ratio of the total number of cases for which the system correctly predicts that a filament produces a CME, divided by the number of associated cases used in testing. FP is the ratio of the total number of cases for which the system incorrectly predicted that a filament does not produce a CME divided by the number of un-associated cases used in testing.

3.2 OPTIMIZING THE LEARNING ALGORITHM In order to find the best parameters and/or  topologies for the learning algorithms, initial training and testing experiments were applied using the Jack- knife technique as explained previously. A total of 2221 associated and not-associated filaments were used for training. This constituted 80% of the total number of associated cases available. The remaining 555 associated and not-associated filaments were used for testing. The results obtained are evaluated using the ROC analysis technique.

For our work we have used the Anova-Kernel SVM as it outperforms the Neural Networks (NNs) used for solar data processing as explained in [13].

Optimising the SVM perfornlance requires optimising the parameters associated with the Anova-Kernel, which are the degree and gamma values and the classification threshold. For each value ten experiments using the Jack-Knife technique were carried out and the averages of the TP and FP results found. All the experiments \vere carried out using the "MySVM" software [20].

To optimize the SVM classifier the gamma value is varied from 1 to lOin steps of 1 for each degree value which is also varied from 1 to lOin steps of 1.

The input features are also varied in seven groups as shown in Table 2. As explained previously, for each of these 100 configurations, ten experiments were carried out using the Jack-knife technique and the average TP and FP values recorded. Hence, 700 experiments were carried out with 700 SVM configurations, resulting in 70 average TP and FP values being produced. These values are plotted in Figure 6 to find the optimum degree and gamma values and optimum inputs configuration.

According to reference [19], the best performance shown in ROC curves is the one furthermost from the random guessing diagonal line. So, the optimum SVM configurations were found as shown in Figure 7 which is the magnified region labelled Z in Figure 6.

In order to find the classification thresholds that provide the best prediction for the optimum SVM topologies, the threshold values are changed from 0 to 1 in steps of 0.01 for every input and their selected optimum topologies. Then for each threshold value, ten experiments are carried out using the Jack-knife technique and the average TP and FP values are calculated. At the end of these experiments the ROC curve is drawn as shown in Figure 8.

The optimum threshold values are found by choosing the threshold value with performance closest to the northwest corner in the ROC curve. This is shown clearly by magnifying region Z of Figure 8 as depicted in Figure 9.

2008 5th International Multi-Conference on Systems, Signals and Devices  Figure 9 Zoom of box Z in Figure 8: ROC graph showing the best SVM topologies with variable threshold values  As can be seen by inspection of Figure 7 and Figure 9, an SVM classifier that accepts two inputs (group 2a) with degree and gamma values of 10 and 3 respectively and a classification threshold value of 0.74 provides the best prediction performance. This SVM configuration provides average TP and FP rates of 0.640 and 0.254, respectively.

The next best performance is achieved by using three inputs (group 3) with degree, gamma and threshold values of 2, 4 and 0.65, respectively. This SVM configuration provides TP and FP rates of 0.651 and 0.281 respectively.

In general, there has been an increase in the prediction rate with the use of more discriminative input features, such as the filament type, compared to the input groups of Table 2. The experiments indicate that the filament type and duration are more important for CME prediction than the filament extent.

4. Conclusions and Future Research In this paper, we propose a novel machine-  learning based system that analyses the available data in the NGDC filaments catalogue and the SOHO LASCO CMEs catalogue. Our system associates CMEs with filaments and represents these associations numerically in training vectors that are fed to machine learning algorithms (SVM). An optimisation process is applied to SVM before the learning process starts. The SVM is also used because of its outstanding classification performance as reported in [13, 14].

To determine the optimum configuration for the SVM classification system that was used in this work, many experiments were carried out changing the values of gamma and degree. Different classification thresholds have been tested to determine the optimum configuration based on ROC curves. The Jack-knife technique was used in all these experiments as described in subsection 3.1.

All the reported filaments and CMEs in solar cycle 23 between 1 January 1996 and 31 December 2006 have been investigated. The association software has associated 1396 eruptive filaments/prominences with corresponding CMEs and highlighted another 1380 significant filaments as not associated with any  CMEs. These associations are for a = 240 minutes.

After finding the optimum configurations for the SVM, it has been found that the best CME prediction performance achieved has TP and FP rates of 0.64 and 0.25 respectively.

We believe that this work is important because for the first time the association between filaments and CMEs has been explored and verified using machine learning. This association is represented using computerised learning rules. As explained in [14] this representation is an important step for creating automated and reliable prediction systems that can predict the extremes of space weather. However our work is far from complete and the prediction performance is not as high as it should be because of the following challenges that we still need to overcome: ? A large number of filaments are missing from the  NGDC filaments catalogue. We have managed to verifY this by comparing the data in the filaments catalogue with Synoptic maps from Meudon Observatory, which are available publicly at http://bass2000.obspm.fr.

? Current work has associated filaments with CMEs within ?30? from the filaments's centroid. Hence, we have a constant association sector width of60?.

However, different CMEs have different angular width values, which means that we need to use a dynamic sector width for future associations.

? CMEs can be associated with either erupting filaments/prominences and/or solar flares.

However, in this study, CMEs were associated only with filaments and solar flare associations provided in our previous work [14] are not considered. To enhance the CMEs prediction accuracy we need to combine both association algorithms. This will be investigated in the near future.
