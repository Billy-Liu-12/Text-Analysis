The association Analysis for Construction Laws and  Regulations Data

Abstract- Association analysis is especially important to users. It is becoming very important to provide association recommendation by the association analysis of construction laws and regulations data for the users. Extracted features from each document, the cumulative frequency of 85% of the requirement that has made the feature bearing the most message of the text, summary of all text feature form the feature set of laws and regulations of construction data and make it impossible for association analysis of outlier text features. In gray correlation analysis, the system features is corresponding to the features of laws and regulations of construction data, the corresponding ?sequence item? is corresponding to ?text? that the sub-vector of feature vector. Furthermore, according to the features of construction laws and regulations and referring to the modeling thinking of text vector space model, the vector space model of the data characteristics is established. From analyzing the definition of the frequency item sets, the method to obtain the data characteristic frequent item sets laws and regulations of construction is expounded. From the angle of data characteristic association the generalized gray absolute association degree is improved. Then the association rules of data characteristic are educed and the recall rate of construction laws and regulations data is raised. The effectiveness of this association analysis method is verified on the experiments of construction laws and regulations date sets of Shannxi province.

I. INTRODUCTION  Association analysis is achieved through Association rules.

Association rule mining because of its novelty of concept and the potential usefulness of rule itself, like this data mining research become a research hot spot in data mining field in recent years, forming a variety of types of association rules and mining algorithm of association rule. With in-depth study of association rules, the classical association rule mining problem has been getting more sophisticated, association analysis methods in applications field have emerging such as text mining, biological data mining, multimedia data mining etc, the focus of association analysis research also turned to  how to make use of association rules to solve practical problems [1-4], the correlation analysis method in the field of laws and regulations of construction?and the unstructured text data has not been seen yet. The purpose of correlation analysis on laws and regulations of construction is to recommend associated query content for users under the limited output condition. By analysising the relationships among the feature of laws and regulations of construction data, the corresponding association rule technology will be realized to implement the information association recommend.



II. THE ASSOCIATION ANALYSIS OF THE FEATURE OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS OF  CONSTRUCTION DATA  The goal of Association rule is to pursue the regularity of various factors-cooccurrenced which appear in a general affair.

Association rules generated by the key generated frequent itemsets and generate association rules, but the association rules generated and the success of association analysis is based on the feature text data.

2.1 Feature vector space model of laws and regulations of construction data  Text mining technology is derived from data mining, like a bridge linking the technology and demands is the ext data convert to the numerical data. Vector space model make the text data into numerical data is an ideal expression forms of laws and regulations of construction data, so transformation processes to determine the vector sub-vector is the feature selection.

2.1.1 Vector space model of laws and regulations of construction data  Vector space model of laws and regulations of construction data construct using the following method: first, deal the laws and regulations of construction data with word treatment. Second, use the basic idea [5] of frequency feature selection in text sets, for each text which have been deal with its frequency of candidate feature in descending order, candidate feature should be censored when the cumulative frequency of 85%, the rest feature for indexing and empowering as corresponding frequency. Third, summary of all text feature form the feature set of laws and regulations of     construction data. Fourth, indexing each text forms vector space model set of laws and regulations of construction data.

The definition of Vector Space Model of laws and regulations of construction data  LetT is based on experience or a sample can be carried out feature selection in the each text but the overall threshold value. ikw?  is the frequency statistic of i-th ( 1,2, , )i m= text owned candidate feature ikt? , if ikw T? > , then ik ikw w?= ,  ik ikt t?= , ikt identified as the feature of the text; if ikw T? < , give up candidate feature ikt? . Accordingly selected feature iS of each text, repeat the process to the m file texts, merger and  get the overall feature set and note for 1 2  { , , }  m  i n i  S t t t =  =? ,  according to the  m  i i  S = ?  for indexing and empowering to each  text id , then the vector space model of the text is defined as:  1 1 2 2(( , ),( , ), ,( , ))i i i n ind t w t w t w=      (2-1) There can choose the threshold value T ,which is  85%,and it also can modify threshold valueT by experience, if frequency of candidate feature of the text in descending order and cumulative frequency up to 85%, take the candidates feature for the text feature, delete the rest candidates feature of the text.

Repeat the above process to the new text; if there is a new feature appear in the new text dose not exist in the features set, the new features will be incorporated into the features word set, then begin to index the new text, moreover, fill zero in the dimension which formed by the new feature of existing text.

Extracted features from each document, the cumulative frequency of 85% of the requirement that has made the feature bearing the most message of the text, summary of all text feature form the feature set of laws and regulations of construction data and make it impossible for association analysis of outlier text features. In the past, according to the definition of frequent itemsets, outlier features are usually difficult to become a frequent itemsets, that is in accordance with the existing mining technology of text association rule, the relationship of outlier data of laws and regulations of construction data can not be found.

2.1.2 Feature vector space model of laws and regulations of construction data  Feature vector space model of laws and regulations of construction data i-th ( 1,2, , )i m= is defined as?  ,i it d ?=               ?2-2?  that is, it is the transpose of id . Specifically,  1 2( , ,..., ),i i i imt w w w= ijw is i -th feature word in the j -th text vector space model. Briefly, the value of ijw is 1 or 0,  1ijw = express feature word it  appear in the j -th text feature,  0ijw =  express feature word it  did not appear in the j -th text feature.

2.2 The Association rules of the feature of laws and regulations of construction data  The construct of feature vector space model of laws and regulations of construction data has been fully taken into account the data query and outlier data, thus the frequent itemsets of association analysis of laws and regulations of construction data directly use (2-2) to express the text feature.

At this time, frequent itemsets is composed of 1-itemsets, which is constitute the basic elements of itemsets in Apriori algorithm, 2- itemsets and above it is very difficult constitute the frequent itemsets in laws and regulations of construction data, which is have a gap to Association Rules Mining Algorithm. Gray association rules are aimed primarily at the system feature sequence data, in geometrical, correlation degree interpreted as the relational of two systems features that is through the similarity of geometry shape of sequence curve to determine weather close link of relational between system features or not. In fact, the co-occurrence phenomenon of features in all documents is association analysis of the co-occurrence phenomenon of features, let text as the sub-vector will be the feature vector considered as a broken line, if closer of the two broken line, then the correlation more intense between the eigenvector. In gray correlation analysis, the system features is corresponding to the features of laws and regulations of construction data, the corresponding ?sequence item? is corresponding to ?text? that the sub-vector of feature vector, furthermore, Gray System Model also have the advantages of nothing special requirements and restrictions to the experimental observation data and its distribution.

2.2.1 Improved on generalized absolute grey correlation degree  In order to reflect the associate of feature of laws and regulations of construction data, introducing   m  ij ik jk k  s w w = ? and  | | | |  m  i j ik jk k  s s w w =  ? ?? , which reflects the degree of similarity and differences among features, the generalized absolute gray correlation degree [6] should be expressed as follows:  1 2 ,  1 2 | | ij  ij ij i j  s s s s  ? +  = + + ?  (2-3)  where , 1,2,..., .i j n= Formula is the approximate ratio of the total 2 ijs of feature words it and jt appeared in the text at the same time and the total 2 ij i js s s+ ? of feature words it and jt appeared in the text, reflects the correlation degree between keywords it  and jt . ij? satisfied normative, symmetry and proximity of gray correlation degree.

2.2.2 The formation of Association rules i Association threshold value. The meaning of the    threshold associated is corresponding to the confidence level of association analysis in the data mining. When applications through experience or sampling to determine the threshold value.

i  Frequent feature itemsets. The sets formed by feature words of laws and regulations of construction data is the frequent feature itemsets generated by association rules.

i  The formation of Association rules ? i jt t? ?. The feature of "frequent feature itemsets it , jt by the formula (2-3) calculated ij? . When greater than and equal to a given threshold value, find the association rules ? i jt t? ?.

Time complexity of generate association rules algorithm is ( ( 1)/2),O n n?  the lowliness time complexity of frequent itemsets generate by Aprior Algorithm is ( ),O n k?  the highest  time complexity is (2 1),n kO ? ?  simple average time complexity is ((2 1)/2),nO n k+ ? ?  it also introduces association rules.

FP-Growth Algorithm is more efficient than Apriori Algorithm in the search for frequent itemsets, but to build FP-tree is also required to spend a certain amount of time, when the database scale is too large, FP-Growth Algorithm implementation efficiency is still low. Research has shown that generated association rules at the same data sets on FP-Growth Algorithm is efficient than Apriori Algorithm an order of magnitude[7-8]. Following the above discussion, we can see: When n is infinite, based on association rules generated by Improved Generalized Absolute Gray Correlation Degree the efficiency much higher than the Apriori Algorithm and FP-Growth Algorithm, but also this method of association rules generated can be simple completion of the expansion of new data.

2.2.3 Experimentation  Because of the laws and regulations of construction data is very common in Provincial and municipal, therefore, using the cluster sampling strategy has been taken in laws and regulations of construction text data of Shaanxi Province since 1949 received by row represent of the text features with 362 lines and rank on behalf of the Boolean matrix of text with 250lines, apply the formula (2-3) to calculated the correlation degree ij? between features, threshold value is 0.8, the results of the association analysis shown in Table 1.1. Due to space limitations, here only give some results, which indicate that the querying users may receive associated recommend.

III. CONCLUSION Appling the Improved Generalized Absolute Gray  Correlation Degree to laws and regulations of construction data of the Shaanxi Province, the paper finds that it get the results of association analysis coinciding with the actual, which makes it possible for association analysis of outlier text features. Compared with the Apriori Algorithm and FP-Growth Algorithm methods, this method is low-cost and can promote in laws and regulations of construction and similar inquiries System of provincial and municipal, and it will be further to research the most message of the text, summary of all text feature form the feature set of laws and regulations of construction data and expected to save more time and space on the existing foundation.
