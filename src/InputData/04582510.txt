Varying Load Big Electric Current Rectifier  Autocontrol Method Study

Abstract - In this paper, a novel control scheme of the application of PWM method in the rectifier power source control is proposed. The proposed method is to control the rise, or fall in current and some switch signals, which are affected by the varying load. Although the PWM is used broadly, the method how to determine the PWM pulse width in the rectifier galvanization production line is seldom to be concerned. The computer + PLC control mode is also used in the control process, and it is the most popular control mode until now. It is called SCADA system (supervisory control and data acquisition system). The improved performance of the control strategy is illustrated by the experiment, and the result curve is presented in this paper.



I.  INTRODUCTION The selenium rectifier is the most important equipment in  the plating production line. It is known that the control quality of the rectifier current influences the quality of galvanization product directly. As we know, the traditional way to control the current is mainly by hand, which may cause the great current fluctuation phenomenon. In this case, the rate of eligibility may drop to 50% or even lower. It is urgent for us to consider a more practical way to control the rectifier?s current automatically. In order to improve the product quality, in this paper, we propose a new way to control the rectifier?s current based on PWM [1, 6-7].

The rectifier power source what we used is made in Switzerland. The main body of the device is soaked in a cylinder, so it is impossible to view clearly the interior structure. Many process variables need to be controlled such as temperature, liquid position, pressure, current, voltage, cargos signal and so on. The rectifier provides a control interface for us, and we can not change the rotational speed of the rectifier motor in the process of the current adjustment. If only the PID controller is used, it is impossible to control all the parameters in the process. That is the reason that we didn?t choose the overshoot control. In another hand, we once tried to use the DSP to control the process. But the main drawback of this method is that the control cycle is too long, which can not satisfy the adjustments? flexibility request.

So in this paper, we develop a method to control the current rise, fall and switch signals automatically. And we use the computer + PLC control mode, which is the most popular control mode until now [4].

In this way, by monitoring the change of the load, it is realized to control the whole process.

As the load usually varies, the determinate of the pulse  width becomes a key part in the control process.

To determine the pulse width, the first step is to analyze the  characteristic of the rectifier power source. The adding electricity process is assumed to be linear for convenience.

Secondly, the mathematical model of the current adjustment is obtained. Lastly, the WINCC software is used to control the pulse width based on the obtained model [2-3].

There are certain relationships between the current of the power source and the size of the plates, the ingredient and temperature of the liquor, the distance from the pole to the anode and so on. So the whole process is explained as follows: when the size of the plates increases, its resistance decreases, which will lead to the current to increase very fast.

In addition, after a long time, conductivity of liquor may change remarkably, which also affect the value of current.

What?s more, the phenomenon of ebullition caused by the plating process also influences the conductivity of liquor. So the varying current can be considered as the varying load [5].

The main contribution of this paper is that the theoretical method is realized in a real practical system. Our method can determine the pulse width based on the varying load, which makes it easy to real-time control. The experiments demonstrate a good performance of our proposed control scheme.



II. OPERATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF RECTIFIER POWER SOURCE  The type of the rectifier power source of the galvanization production line is IDS Z1-01 12000/12, the rated voltage is ~380V, the rated current is ~380A, the rated frequency is 50HZ, the output voltage is 0-12V and the output current is 12000A. In order to adjust the current, the output voltage is changed by dragging glide rheostat. When the current of the rectifier is adjusted by hand, we usually directly use the rectifier switch knob, the rectifier rise knob and fall knob. The switch knob of the rectifier is used to control the opening and closing of the rectifier. The rise knob of the rectifier is used to control the dynamo running clockwise, which makes the output voltage increase. The fall knob of the rectifier is used to control the dynamo running anticlockwise, which makes the output voltage reduce.

The ascent part of the current is quite important when the current is adjusted. The rise and the drop part are driven by the same electrical machinery, so they should have the same characteristic. Therefore the characteristic of the ascent part is       mainly considered. The rise knob of the rectifier is driven by a square-wave (square-wave represents the open and closure of the knob). The bestirring time of the square-wave is the transient time that the current rises from zero to maximum in the production. In order to ensure sufficient electric motor movement, the rise knob is closed when the current achieves 10000A. The experimental results are shown in Figure 1.

a                 b  Fig.1. Rectifier square-wave drive result As seen from Figure 1, after the rectifier turns on the  electrical source, the rise knob of the rectifier is opened for h seconds and it is closed until the current achieve 10000 A.

There are four stages in the whole process. At the beginning, the current increases slowly. Then, it begins to increase very fast after the electric motor runs steadily. The third stage is the inertia increase-stage in t? after the rise knob of the rectifier is closed. The last stage is the steady stage. The slow increase-stage is according to approximately small slope straight line, and the time of which consumes is about 2 seconds. The fast ascent-stage can be approximately seen as a big slope straight line, and the time of which consumes is decided by the current finally. Because the tests are carried on under the biggest load, t? =0.7 second basically indicates the time that the motor needs to run after the rise knob of rectifier turnoff. Considering the influence of the temperature to motor and the control reliability, in practical, we need maintain surplus, so we take t? =1 second. When the current is in the steady stage, it fluctuates near to the stable value, and still has the increasing tendency. The reason of the fluctuation is that the solution is in the state of circulate mix when the plating piece works in the solution, and the non-uniform of the solution causes the load to have the small fluctuation, which brings to the current fluctuation. But the reason of current?s increasing tendency is that the galvanization process will heat up the plating solution, which will promote the activeness of the plating solution, result in the impedance decreasing and cause the current to ascend gradually. Based on technological requirement, in the practical control, the range of the current fluctuation should be within the stable state value ?50 ampere.

It is clearly from figure 1 a, each section of the rectifier's response is approximately a straight line. Therefore we carry on the subsection linearization to the non linear curve of Figure 1 a. After linearization, rectifier response includes the slow increase-stage which has the slope tan ? , the fast  ascent-stage which has the slope tan ? , the inertia run-stage which has the slope tan?  and the steady stage.



III. RECTIFIER ELECTRICAL SOURCE AUTOCONTROL DESIGN  (1) The Control Scheme Ascertain To realize the control of the rectifier current precisely, the  strategy of the closed loop control is adopted into the whole system. The block diagram of the automatic control system is shown in Figure 2.

Fig.2. the Schematics of Control System  The switch of the rectifier is connected with the PLC DO block, and the output current is transmitted to the configuration software WINCC by the PLC AI block.

Considering the control algorithm may be complex, the whole system's control strategy is programmed and compiled under WINCC C-SCRIPT, which is capable to speed up the development progress. The desired value of the current is set directly through the configuration software. To the different work pieces or different production situations of one work piece, the desired value of   the current can be revised.

In the practical control, the PLC is connected with the rise and the fall knobs of the rectifier power source, as well as the current gathering input end.  The computer loaded with the WINCC system is connected with the PLC. When it works, the desired current is obtained by the computer and compared with the actual current, and the pulse width of PWM can be figured out by the computer. Then the WINCC controls the PLC work by using the proposed algorithm. The PLC turns on the relay. Then the relay turns on the scene switch, which drives the scene power source to work.

In the computer, configuration software includes internal variable and external variable. The internal variable is used in calculation and the external variable is used in the PLC connection, the external variable has DO, DI, AI and AO and so on, which are the correspond parts of the PLC.

Configuration software is installed in the computer. The PLC is connected with the computer by the communication cable. The configuration software itself has communication function with the PLC. Therefore, it is very easy to transmit the calculated result to the PLC.

PLC DO block is directly connected to the switch of the rectifier, and the DO block equates to a switch. When the control command in DO block is one, DO block opens the corresponding rectifier.

(2) The questions should be considered in the control process a. The influence of the varying load on the control system The products that the entire production line produces are  various, which results in the final loads are also various.

b. The influence of the steady state current fluctuation to control system  As it can be seen from work characteristic of the rectifier, the current well adjusted still has the fluctuation phenomenon.

In order to stabilize the operating current of the products, the rectifier should be monitored at every moment in the practical control.

c. The requirements of control rapidity and control precision  In the galvanization process, the power supply time of the product is longer, so in the longer power supply period, the transient current fluctuation has no great influence on the product quality. Therefore at the premise of the guarantee control precision, it is the basic principle of this control to raise the speed as fast as possibly.

(3)Control strategy design The mathematical model of the current adjustment value is  shown by formula (1).

nTtftfTtftftf ??????+???+??= 313121 )(7.0)()2()()(2)( ?1?  The first item of the formula (1) is the current adjustment quantity in the slow increase-stage. ( )tf1? is the slope of the section namely ?tg  calculated by the gathering datum, and the time of the current adjustment is 2s in this section. The second item is the current adjustment quantity in the current fast ascent-stage. )(2 tf? is the slope of the section namely  ?tg  calculated through the gathering datum, and )2( 1 ?T is the time of this section. The third item is the current adjustment quantity which is caused by the inertia of the rectifier electrical machinery. )(3 tf? is the slope of the section namely ?tg . The last item is the fine adjustment quantity of the current. 3T  is the fine adjustment time, and n is the fine adjustment times.

The ideal control performance is that the current arrives at  the precision scope of technological requirement when rectifier stops adjustment. Therefore, it is necessary to control the pulse width time 1T  accurately. Firstly we compute the current adjustment quantity which is caused by the inertia of the rectifier electrical machinery. It is shown in the formula (2)  ? ?  tg tgIf i ???= 7.0                                            ?2?  In the formula (2), if  is the current adjustment quantity caused by the electrical machinery inertia, and I?  is increase quantity of each second of the current fast adjustment stage, which can be obtained by the actual gathering datum.

The ? ?  tg tg  is a constant and determined by the system  structure, which is near to 0.3 through calculating the gathering data. The actual current examination value rf  is the difference value between the desired value ef  and the inertia adjustment value if , which is shown in the formula (3).

ier fff ?=                                           ?3? The least scanning period of the configuration software  WinCC is 250ms.The actual gathering current can not satisfy the critical condition absolutely, so the remainder of the procedure scanning period is kept, by which the pulse width time 1T  is ascertained, as formula (4) shows.

Fine adjustment time 3T  is related with craft. The current precision of the galvanization craft is 50?  A.  To ensure the current control precision, the current is adjusted when it surpasses the desired value 20? A. The upper limit of the exact adjustment is 40? A. In order that the current value will not surpass the precision scope in the fine adjustment process,  3T  is determined by the formula (5).

IV.  EXPERIMENT  We did the experiments in a practical system and compared the manual control with the automatic control. The experimental result is shown in the Figure 4.

Fig.4. a    Fig.4. b Fig.4.a is the manual adjustment curve, and Fig.4.b is the  automatic control curve. From two charts, it is obvious that the automatic control process is stable, and has more advantages than the manual adjustment, which proves the feasibility of the control strategy.



V.        CONCLUSION Although the PWM is used broadly, as far as the method  how to determine the PWM pulse width in the rectifier galvanization production line is seldom to be concerned. In this paper, we have applied the method into a real practical system. Our method can determine the pulse width based on the varying load, which makes it easy for real-time control in the rectifier galvanization production line.

The computer + PLC control mode is also used in the control process. The experiment results indicate the good performance of our proposed control scheme.

For practical application, this method may have some problems, as it control the system mainly based on the referenced value and the measurement value in the scene which may be not accurate. When we use this method in practical system, there may be the situation that the error between the measured value (gathered by PLC) and the real electric current value (displayed by the rectifier power source) is large and even nearly a few hundred amperes. This case brings on some mistakes in the control. One of method to solve this problem is to use two parallel PLC AI ports to measure the signal in scene. If the values of both ports are different, there may be some faults in the system, and then the system should be stopped and checked.

This method can be used in such situation that the process variables are controlled by an on-off variable. For example, the liquid position controlled by electromagnetism valve, the automatic adjustment of hydraulic vehicle and the heat preservation box and so on.
