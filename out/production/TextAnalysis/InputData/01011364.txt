A Framework for Dynamic Evidence Based Medicine

Abstract  Dynamic Evidence Based Medicine (DEBM) is defined as the process of finding evidence about the care of individual patients automatically and dynamically in the case that we cannot rely on any literatures or guidelines. In this paper, we develop a framework for DEBM using data mining technologies that make it possible to automatically analyze huge clinical databases and to discover patterns behind them. We define the requirements of data mining system for DEBM. The following two functions are required of the system.

(1) Supporting clinical decision making, and (2) Discovering rare patterns which human beings can hardly find. In order to support clinical decision making, rule discovery methods such as association rule mining are applied to this framework. We adopt a post analysis approach using a rulebase and queries. Discovered rules are collected into a rulebase for further analysis. By executing queries to the rulebase, users can obtain the keys to evidence for making decisions about the clinical care. We preliminarily implement a prototype of rulebase and post analysis tool based on our framework. This tool can assist users to analyze discovered rules.

1. Introduction  Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) [14] has been recognized as an important approach to make clinical decisions about the care of individual patients using the best available evidence. In general, EBM is based on the facts which is peer reviewed in literatures or guidelines. Therefore, it is difficult to apply EBM to acute prevalenting and self-terminating diseases such as influenza. It is also difficult to apply it to rare mass intoxications or unknown side effects of drugs. In those situations, we cannot rely on any evidence in literatures. On the one hand, by improving of healthcare information systems and widely- spreading network oriented Electronic Healthcare Record (EHR) systems, a huge number of clinical data can be collected through the systems and be stored into large clinical  Proceedings of the 15 th IEEE Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS 2002)    databases. If we could find the evidence for making decisions about the care by analyzing such the clinical databases dynamically and automatically, we could apply EBM to acute prevalenting and self-terminating diseases. We call this type of EBM ?Dynamic Evidenced Based Medicine (DEBM)?.

Data mining technologies [7] provides one solution to this requirement. These technolo- gies make it possible to automatically analyze such the large databases and to discover patterns behind the data. Of course, not all such patterns are evidence themselves. How- ever, these patterns provide us the keys to find the evidence.

In this paper, we develop a framework for DEBM using data mining techniques. The following aspects must be considered in developing the framework. (1) Real time collecting of the clinical data from various EHR systems, (2) Finding the evidence dynamically and automatically, and (3) Evaluating the evidence. As for collecting clinical data, it is necessary to collect them from not only a single medical institute but also a wide area by using network oriented EHRs. In order to analyze the data uniformly, a standardized data format is also required. Moreover, we must consider security issues such as privacy protection and anonymity for individual clinical data since real clinical data is collected and analyzed widely. However, we focus only on the second aspect of analyzing clinical databases using data mining techniques in this paper.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes a requirement analysis for DEBM systems. Section 3 discusses a framework for DEBM. Section 4 presents our preliminary experiment. Section 5 concludes this paper.

2. Requirements for dynamic evidence based medicine  First, we define the requirements of data mining system for DEBM. We must consider, at least, the following two functions are required of the system. (1) Supporting clinical decision making, and (2) Discovering rare patterns which human beings can hardly find from clinical data. For the first requirements, users execute a variety of queries for acute prevalenting and self-terminating diseases to the DEBM system in order to validate the evidence of clinical care. The system must answer the query by analyzing the database within reasonable response times. The following are examples of queries.

Example 1-1: (Acute prevalenting and self-terminating diseases) Is Amantadine effective in influenza of this season?

Example 1-2: (Acute prevalenting and self-terminating diseases) Should we use antibioties to this rare bacterial food mass intoxication?

As regards the second requirements, the system discover rare patterns automatically with- out any queries. The following example of side effects of a drug is an typical requirement.

In some cases, side effects of drugs occur so rarely that human beings can hardly find them.

Discovering such rare patterns is one of the important requirements.

Example 2: (Rare case) Anemia seems to be developed rarely with the patients who take this newly developed  anti-hyperlipemic drug. Is it unknown side effect?

In both cases, it is required to consider temporal aspects since clinical data is stored as temporal databases.

Proceedings of the 15 th IEEE Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS 2002)    3. A framework for dynamic evidence based medicine  3.1. Supporting clinical decision making  In this framework, we adopt a post analysis approach using rule discovery methods in data mining such as association rule mining [1, 3]. Association rule mining is one of the most popular data mining methods. An association rule is an expression X ? Y , where X and Y are set of items where an item is an attribute-value pair. Given a database D of transactions where each transaction T ? D is a set of items. X ? Y expresses that whenever a transaction T contains X then T probably contains Y also. The rule X ? Y holds in the transaction set D with confidence c if c% of transactions in D that contain X also contain Y . The rule X ? Y has support s in the transaction set D if s% of transactions in D contain X ?Y . Given a set of transactions D, the problem of mining association rules is to generate all association rules that have certain user-specified minimum support and confidence.

By applying the methods to the database beforehand, discovered rules are collected into a rulebase. When a query is executed by a user, the system analyzes the discovered rules and answers a set of rules that satisfy the query. The user can inspect the rules and find clues to evidence that he/she wants to know. One advantage of this approach is that response times are estimated to be short since large databases are analyzed beforehand.

For example, when the user wants to examine some drug is effective in influenza, the user executes a query on rules that include both the drug and influenza. The system finds all rules in the rulebase that satisfy the query. The user can obtain the clues to evidence by investigating which factors of the rules are associated with influenza and the drug.

In the past researches, several methods [9, 10, 2, 8] are proposed for interactive rule analysis using queries. [9] proposes a template based method for selecting interesting rules interactively. [10] proposes a technique that allows the user to specify his/her existing knowledge about the domain and selects the rules using the knowledge according to con- formity and unexpectedness. [2] proposes a shape queries that retrieve rules based on the shape of the temporal changes on the parameter of rules. [8] presents a SQL and OQL based approach to support interactive association rule mining. All of those methods are applicable to our post analysis approach. In our preliminary experiment, we adopt a simple SQL based approach which is similar to [8].

In general, rule mining methods produce a huge number of rules and most of them are often redundant and meaningless. Therefore summarization, pruning and filtering tech- niques for discovered rules are necessary so that the user can analyze manually the large number of rules effectively. Several efficient techniques [11, 12] are also applicable for this purpose.

3.2. Discovering rare patterns  The system is required to discover rare patterns without any queries from users. We discuss rare patterns in the context of association rule mining. Usual association rule mining methods fail to discover the rare patterns due to their low support value. However, setting minimum support very low causes combinatorial explosion and produces a huge number of rules. Exception rules discovery [15] is an effective approach to this problem. It discovers pairs of association rules X ? Y and their corresponding exceptions X, Z ? Y ?,  Proceedings of the 15 th IEEE Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS 2002)    Rulebase  Clinical DatabasesRule Mining Engine  EHR system  DBMS  Post Analysis Tool  Query  clinical data  Preprocessing on temporal features  Preprocesser  Mining rules and store them into rulebase  Query processing and rule monitoring  Analyzing the results  Figure 1. A Framework for DEBM  where X and Z are conjunctions of attribute-value pairs and Y and Y ? are attribute-value pairs corresponding to the same attribute but with different values. Those exception rules are regarded as a kind of rare patterns. However, it cannot discover low support rules.

Let r be an association rule and r ? be an specialized rule that has the same consequent but an additional attribute in its antecedent part. Then, rare patterns are regarded as the rules that satisfy the following two conditions. First, r and r ? have quite low support and confidence. Second, the confidence of r? is significantly different from that r has.

Under these conditions, the additional attribute of r ? is potentially important factor for the consequent of r and r?. We think finding such pair of rules is one possible approach to discover rare patterns. Further consideration is necessary in this part of framework.

3.3. Mining temporal data  Clinical data is continuously stored as temporal databases day by day. Taking account of temporal feature such as changes of values over the time axis is essential in this framework.

Several researches on temporal association rules are proposed [5, 13]. However it imposes restrictions on available rule discovery methods.

Another possible solution is preprocessing approach that temporal relationships between attributes are aggregated in every period of mining. It seems to be difficult to aggregate all the temporal relationships. However, in the context of DEBM, we only concern the difference of values from a point of time (in general, onset time). In this case, if there are n temporal attributes in the database, only n additional attributes are created by the preprocess in each period. Rule discovery methods are then applied to the preprocessed databases. One advantage of this approach is that it does not impose any restrictions on the rule discovery methods. Several efficient techniques could be applied to maintain the discovered rules from the incrementally updated databases [4, 6].

3.4. Outline of the framework  We design a framework of data mining system for DEBM based on the above discussion.

Figure 1 shows the design. All clinical data is collected incrementally through the EHR systems. They are preprocessed with respect to temporal attributes. By some time period such as a day, rule mining engine discovers rules by applying rule discovery methods and  Proceedings of the 15 th IEEE Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS 2002)    Figure 2. A tool for post analysis  stores the rules into the rulebase. Post analysis tools provide the users a variety of ways for analyzing the results.

4. A preliminary experiment  We implement a prototype of post analysis tool based on our framework. Figure 2 shows an example use of this tool. A rulebase is implemented as a relational database. The discovered rules are stored into the rulebase. Users can obtain their concerned association rules from the rulebase by using the tool.

As a preliminary experiment, we apply an association rule mining method to a diabetes database which are collected in our hospital. It has 1251 cases and each case is described by 22 attributes. Over 250 thousands association rules are discovered from the database and stored into the rulebase. When users choose several attributes their concerned, SQL based queries are executed to the database and retrieve rules that satisfy the queries. Response times vary from 16 to 307 seconds depending on the queries executed. We do not think the performance is sufficient for applying the tool to larger rulebases. Further improvement is necessary. Moreover, some simple queries answer a quite large number of rules. Applying other filtering methods to the obtained rules will be required.

5. Conclusion  In this paper, we have described a conceptual framework for DEBM. Several issues remain open such as the structure of databases suitable for this framework, temporal mining, and discovering rare patterns. Further consideration is necessary for these issues. We plan  Proceedings of the 15 th IEEE Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS 2002)    to implement a prototype system. Availability and scalability of the framework are then examined.

As described in the Introduction, consideration on data collecting methods and security issues are essentially for this framework in order to develop a practical system. Incorporat- ing them into this framework is also part of our future work.
