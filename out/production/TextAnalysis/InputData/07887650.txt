Watson Research Center  Christoph Koch, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology  B ig data has been an enabler for innovation, reconstruction, and advancement of most sectors of our society, and it?s receiving continuous and growing attention from researchers and practitioners in academia, industry, and  government. There are, however, still lots of challenges spanning from theoretical  G u e s t  e d i t o r s ?  i n t r o d u c t i o n  foundations, systems, and technology to data policy and standards. This special issue focuses on how big data cuts across systems and applications arenas.

We received 30 submissions and accepted 5 articles after several rounds of reviewing.

These fi ve articles cover a wide spectrum of interesting topics, including feature selection for big data analytics, astronomical image  analysis, large-scale network prediction, on- line URL fi ltering, and massive transaction clustering.

The fi rst article, ?Challenges of Feature Selection for Big Data Analytics,? by Jun- dong Li and Huan Liu, gives a brief intro- duction of the feature selection problem and some typical algorithms that tackle it before exploring six challenges in the context of big  Big Data    8  www.computer.org/intelligent IEEE INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS  G u e s t  e d i t o r s ?  i n t r o d u c t i o n  data analytics. The authors paid par- ticular attention to a feature selection repository called scikit-feature, an open source repository that?s expected to be very useful for the machine learning and big data community.

The second article, ?Big Universe, Big Data: Machine Learning and Im- age Analysis for Astronomy,? by Jan Kremer, Kristoffer Stensbo-Smidt, Fabian Gieseke, Kim Steenstrup Ped- ersen, and Christian Igel, introduces the current status of big survey data in astronomy and the challenges of handling them, and then presents several successful stories and pre- liminary work of applying machine learning and image analysis tech- niques. The authors also discuss the differences and relationships between physical and machine learning mod- els and provide some guidance on how to start exploration of astron- omy data. We agree that there are many interesting research problems such as learning from biased and noisy astronomy data that provide great opportunities in new discover- ies in astrophysics and cosmology.

The third article, ?Structured Re- gression on Multiscale Networks,? by Jesse Glass and Zoran Obradovic, fo- cuses on speeding up a representative structure-based regression algorithm called Gaussian conditional random field (GCRF) via multiscaled net- works. The authors first decompose a large network and integrate the result- ing multiscale networks jointly via the Kronecker product of matrices. They then design a novel algorithm called GCRF-MSN. The authors conducted empirical studies on a large-scale real-life health-informatics dataset containing 35,844,800 inpatient dis- charge records from 500 hospitals collected over 9 years. They report that GCRF-MSN is 36 times faster than baselines with less memory require ment. The authors also re-  port that the proposed solution can handle a network with millions of nodes and trillions of links efficiently, which should be very useful to real structured prediction problems that can be formulated as a network.

The fourth article, ?Online URL Classification for Large-Scale Stream- ing Environments,? by Neetu Singh, Narendra Chaudhari, and Nidhi Singh, describes a novel online and ensemble semisupervised classifica- tion algorithm for filtering URLs in streaming environments. The pro- posed method doesn?t require exploit- ing the webpage?s content or other external information, which enables faster prediction and wider applica- tions. Empirical studies on six large- scale datasets from a live production environment show an improvement of 3 to 8 percent over multinomial lo- gistic regression, support vector ma- chines, and boosting. Furthermore, the authors claim that the proposed method can adapt to situations with concept drift in streaming settings, which is crucial for real deployment.

Last but not least, the fifth article, ?Local PurTree Spectral Clustering for Massive Customer Transaction Data,? by Xiaojun Chen, Si Peng, Joshua  Zhexue Huang, Feiping Nie, and Yong Ming investigates an important prob- lem in retail and e-commerce compa- nies (clustering of massive customer transaction data) and proposes a novel algorithm called local PurTree spectral (LPS) clustering. The authors demon- strate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm using six real-life datasets and report a significant improvement over state-of-the-art clustering meth- ods such as PurTreeClust, concept hi- erarchy clustering, hierarchical ag- glomerative clustering (HAC), and DBSCAN. The proposed algorithm is promising to be applied to various other clustering tasks, in which the ob- jects can be represented in hierarchi- cal taxonomies or trees.
