Association Analysis and Case Study Framework Based on the Name Distinction

Abstract-The research of distinction of name ambiguity in the  field of information retrieval could enhance searching effect.

Therefore, it plays an important role to mine the data of name  ambiguity in order to obtain useful knowledge. In this paper,  we focus on the problem of traditional evaluation and ranking  method used in the clustering. Traditional evaluation and  ranking method ignores the association among the sub  information and simply considers that pieces of sub  information are mutual independent. We present an effective  data mining method framework based on the case study and  association analysis. The method framework is evaluated on  the dataset of name ambiguity from the database of CDBLP.

The dataset includes the information of coauthor name,  workplace, publication, years and ranking of the author of  papers. The experimental results show that one piece of main  sub-information assisted by some minors could form a stronger  rule very useful for the distinction of name ambiguity. Also  some combinations of pieces of minor sub-information could  produce a stronger rule. The association rules selected by the  experiment could be easily explained and commonsensible.

Considering the association rules coming from the objective  data and data mining method, they are more reliable.

I. INTRODUCTION  Since the web technology becomes popular and universal,  people retrieve information from various databases  conveniently and frequently. However, the increasingly  prosperity of web technology also brings us some troubles.

One serious of them is that different things sometime share  the same name which confuses us[I]. For instance, in the  database of CDBLP, an academic search database based on  the authors, we could hardly distinct the papers coming from  different authors with the same name. Having considered the  past related work of the name ambiguity research[2], in this    paper, we will present an effective data mining framework  based on the case study and association analysis[3]. The  framework aims at discovering new knowledge via the  method of case study and association analysis. The  framework is also supposed to provide the proof and  foundations for name distinction and other clustering field.



II. RELATED WORK AND PROBLEMS  There are some difficulties as followed when we refer to  the low accuracy rate and the short of method of name  distinction:  1. It is hard to distinct the different authors by the  similarity of the text since the problem itself is caused by  similarity of the text.

2. Define the information of coauthor, workplace,  publication, ranking, and years of a paper as sub-information.

Although the sub-information such as the coauthor names,  workplaces, publications and the years are useful to identifY  a unique author, these information do not effect alone and it  is hard to obtain enough knowledge without some  association analysis. The mathematical model of the  association is not easy to find.

3. Nowadays, the method which mining the clustering  rule by the individual main sub-information fail to take into  account the influence of other pieces of minor sub  information and assumed the sub-information is independent  from each other. While this assume may cause the losing of  associational information and leads to a relatively low  accuracy rate. In fact, some combinations of pieces of minor  sub-information often lead to a more reliable rule than each  of them does. At the same time, the assistance of some  specific kind of pieces of minor sub-information could also  strongly enhance the accuracy of clustering made by the  main information independently.

4. Nowadays, the method of association analysis could  only provide us the global optimal rules [2][5][6][7].

However, global optimal rules are usually dependent on one  or several pieces of main sub-information. Therefore, in this  paper, we present our method mining rules in all the local  optimal points which aims to overcome the problem that one  or several main factors counteract the influence of minor  sub-information. We desire to mine the information hided in  the minors. For example, the DISTINCT method [1] brought    by Xiaoxin Yin and the GHOST method [3] brought by  Xiaoming Fan used in the distinction of name ambiguity in  information retrieval field adopt the main sub-information of  coauthor and their connectedness as their foundation of  research considering that different people have different  circles of friends who tend to be familiar with each other.

These methods have obtained considerable effects on some  situations and have been taken as an application in CDBLP  in July 2007, whereas, there are still some shortcomings: it is  common for the circles of friends of authors have an  unfavorable connectedness and under this condition, an  author will be divided; at the same time, according to the  theory of six degree[8][9][1O], two different authors possibly  have the same coauthor or could be connected within a small  number of steps which may lead to inaccurate judgment.

Since the problems discussed above, the distinction of name  978-1-4244-7237-6/1 0/$26.00 .201 0 IEEE V4-285   ambiguity in site of CDBLP is not perfect. There are two  instances as followed in which one same author is divided to  two different authors in error caused by the unfavorable  connectedness of their circles of friends. All the Chinese  examples are translated into English in order to be  understood.

Journal of Computer-Aided Design & Computer Graphics,  2008, 20 (04): 469-475  From what we have observed, we can safely draw the  conclusion that there are still many associations between the  two clusters divided by errors. For instance, in the first  example, the authors are both ranked in the behind in the  author list and at the same time, the two clusters have exactly  the same publication; in the second example, the same author  published her paper at the same publication at the same year.

This special characters appeared in the above two examples  among the sub-information are not coincidences through the  analysis based on amount of data, searching information on  the internet and sending email to the authors themselves. In  fact, all the characters could reflect some universal meanings.

Although, the connectedness of author's collaborating circles  are weaken by the behaviors such as changes of workplaces  or holding two or more positions at different workplaces,  there are still some inherent characteristics could be reflected    from the aSSOCiatIOns of information like ranking,  publications, years and so on. Therefore, this paper is  supposed to use the method of association analysis, statistics  and AI to obtain some valuable association rules which could  contribute to the more accurate names distinction system and  the decrease of probability of dividing names by errors.



III. FRAMWORK OF ASSOCIA nON ANALYSIS  AND CASE STUDY  A. CASE STUDY MODEL  Based on the analysis above, the information provided by  information retrieval system and the related work, we choose  5 pieces of information (coauthor, workplace of the author,  publication, year, and ranking) as the source of association  analysis. Then, according to the statistics theory, we take the  measurement of case study to learn the various associations  among information and importance of each candidate rule.

At last, we select several most important association rules.

The procedure of study of association rules are shown as fig  1. The details are described as followed.

Figure 1. Studying flow path of association rules  B. FREQUENT ITEM SET GENERATION  1) SAMPLE COLLECTION: We choose CDBLP  database as the analysis source. CDBLP database is an  academic search system in Chinese. We sample 30 groups of  papers which are nearly 150 pieces of papers as initial data.

One of the problem need to be solved is that how to make  sure whether two papers with the same name belong to the  same author or not. The author's name is under distinction is  eliminated from the initial data since it could not provide any  useful information to the name distinction. Therefore the  cases which two papers have different names of different  authors are equal with the case which two papers have same  names of different authors. The truth of the initial data is  investigated by email, phone and internet in order for us to  study.

2) ENCODING RULES: We sample two papers from the  sample space randomly. Then compare their sub-information.

For example, whether the two papers are belong to the same  author; whether the two papers have same coauthor; whether  they have same workplace; whether they have same  publication; whether the ranking of author are the same. We  take binary encoding method for convenience. Use symbol 1    to denote they have same sub-information and use symbol 0  to denote they have different sub-information. Define a  V4-286   string combined by 0 and 1 as a piece of association rule and  its according value under decimal system as the  characteristic value of the association rule. The experiment  TABLE I  (""l " ? '"0 ., '"0  ? - . ;- 0 0 =  .,  ? ., C"" ? ? 0 ? rIO ., = :0:- = :: to = C"" =- e. ? ;. '"0 " ? Co  ? ? .,  ?

The characteristic value of  00101 is 5.

3) CASE STUDY DATASET: We build the case study  database based on the sample space and encoding rules. The  relationship between the number of cases and number of  samples is as followed:  num _ cases = num _ samples! ( 1 )  num _ samples denotes the number of samples,  num cases - denotes the number of cases.

4) PROBABILITY OF SHARING SAME AUTHOR:  There are the posterior probability that two papers have same  author under a rule in the case study dataset:  P (fi 1 ) _n _um----'-'( fi,--e_a _tu_ r_e?i-,-I s_ a_ m_ e....:...) (2) eature I sam e =  num (feature _ i)  P(feature _i I same) denotes the posterior probability  that two papers have same author. num(feature _ i I same)  denotes the number of cases that two paper have same  author under the feature i in case study dataset.

num(feature _ i) denotes the number of cases under feature i  in the dataset.

5) ALGORITHM: According to the steps above, we  design the algorithm via C language as followed:  (1) i=l; j=1  (2) for(i=I; i<num _samples; i++)  data under this encoding rule is shown as table I. For  example, 00101  EXPERIMENT DATA  (""l "  ? - . ;- 0 ? ? rIO ., =  =-e.= ;. to " " .... 0 to ., .,  16 1  17 1  18 1  19 1  20 1  21 1  22 1  23 1  24 1  25 1  26 1  27 1  28 1  29 1  30 1  31 1  }  ? '"0 ., 0 = ., C"" ? ? :0:- to = = :: '"0 " ? Co ? ., ;- ? rIO = ....

(3) for(i=I; i<num_cases+l; i++)  {  Count the appearance times of each rule;  Count the times two papers have same  author under each rule;  (4) calculate posterior probabilities;  C. RULE GENERATION    During the period of mining rules, we need a kind of  evaluation algorithm to determine which rules should be  selected. Posterior probability is an apparent criterion since it  could reflect the probability of a correct name distinction.

However, posterior probability fails to take into account the  fraction of coverage. For example, there are two candidate  rules as followed[II]:  r1: cover 50 positive cases and 5 negative cases.

r2 cover 2 positive cases and 0 negative cases.

In the example, the positive case represents that two  papers have same author and negative case represents that  V4-287   two papers have different authors. Posterior probability of rl  is 90.91% and posterior probability of r2 is 100%. Although  posterior probability of r1 is lower than posterior probability  of r2, the fraction of coverage of rl is much better than r2  and the fraction of coverage of r2 is too low to be considered  as a valuable rule.

Moreover, there is another problem of glossing the minor  information by main information if we only mining rules  based on posterior probability alone.

Therefore, we could establish a function y=j(x) ,  {x E I I 0 ? x ? 31} . Y denotes posterior probability of a rule. x  denotes the characteristic value of a rule. There are two steps  of mining rules. The first step could ensure the basic  correctness and the second step could ensure the basic  fraction of coverage.

Calculate all of the local maximum points.

Select the rules with best fraction of coverage  nearby the local maximum points as association  rules. There is the evaluation method as followed:  R = num _lap x P (3 )  num _lap denotes the number of positive cases the rule  covered. P denotes the posterior probability. Select the rule  with largest R value as the association rule at its local  maximum point.



IV. EXPERIMENTS AND ANALYSIS  According to the mathematical model and samples, we  obtain the posterior probabilities of each rule as fig 2 and  table 1.

According to the posterior probability of each rules and    the method above, we could work out the following  candidate rules which are naturally divided into 4 probability  intervals at totally different orders of magnitude. The first  probability interval is [0.879, 1]. When the characteristic  value is between 16?31, the probability could reach the local  maximum 1. The second probability interval is [0.772,  0.968]. When the characteristic value is 10, the probability  could reach the local maximum 0.968. The third probability  interval is [0.014, 0.045]. When the characteristic value is 5,  the probability could reach the local maximum. The fourth  probability interval is [0.007, 0.012]. When the characteristic  value is 1, the probability could reach the local maximum  0.012.

There are the 4 characters as followed.

The candidate rules are distributed on 4 probability  intervals at totally different orders of magnitude.

The candidate rules in the same interval share one  same sub-information. For example, the same sub  information in the first interval is coauthor; the  same sub-information in the second interval is  workplace. The public sub-information in an  interval could determine the order of magnitude of  an interval. We call this sub-information in an  interval as leading information and other  information as auxiliary information.

Normally, with the assistance of auxiliary  information, leading information could perform  better and generate a local optimal probability. For  example, in the second interval, candidate rule with  characteristic value 10 have a higher probability  than synthetic rule with characteristic value 8.

There are some associations which could decrease  the probability to the local minimum value. For  example, candidate rules with characteristic value 5  and 6 have higher probabilities than candidate rule  with characteristic value 7.

Finally, we obtain five associatIOn rules with  characteristic value 16, 10, 6 and l.

The association rule with characteristic value 16 could  prove that two papers have an extremely high probability to  be written by one author if they have same coauthor and the  probability in the cases we already known is 1 since it is    common that an author normally collaborate with some  certain people and have the same coauthor.

Studying result  Under the condition that two papers have different  coauthors, two papers which share same workplace and same  years still have a very high probability to be written by one  author. The probability in the cases we already known is  0.958 since one author is likely to publish his paper in the  name of a same workplace and the information of the same  years increases the posterior probability at the same time.

The association rule with characteristic value 6 could  prove that two papers have a high probability to be written  by one author if they have same publication and years under  the condition that two papers have different coauthors and  workplaces since it is common that an author normally has a  certain research direction and level at the same years.

Although the association rule with characteristic value 1  has been selected, we discard this rule considering it overlaps  too few cases and lacks testifY by mass of data.

The association rules selected by the experiment could be  easily explained and commonsensible. Considering the  association rules coming from the objective data and data  mining method, they are more reliable.

V4-288

V. CONCLUSIONS  It is a normal method used by the related work in the past    that selecting useful clustering characters based on the rules  of the observable world. However, this method has a  problem of scarcity of information and lack of testifY. This  paper aims to establish an association analysis model based  on case study and then discover new knowledge from limited  information. This paper is supposed to contribute to the name  distinction and some other clustering analysis with more  reliable method and theory.

We obtain the association rules by the experiment as  followed: having same coauthor; having same workplace and  years; having same publication and years.

The association rules selected by the experiment could be  easily explained and commonsensible. Considering the  association rules coming from the objective data and data  mining method, they are more reliable.

Our future research will focus on the negative correlation  between information [12] that is the local minimum points of  function y=f(x). Further more, we would like to use the  method into the feature extraction of pattern recognitions  which have relative sub-information.
