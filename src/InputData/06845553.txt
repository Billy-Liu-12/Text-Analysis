I. INTRODUCTION  Data Warehouse, Cloud Computing, and Big Data have proposed within latest two decades. In the background of the Big Data, the data warehouse has become a hot topic in the research area. A typical data warehouse uses different data source to transform the data into a data warehouse through the process of ETL. And it will use OLAP services to achieve the data conversion and analyze at the last [1].

However, using this way to move and consolidate data is expensive. The high-demand of hardware cannot be ignored when we build a data warehouse. The main purpose of the data warehouse is to perform data analysis and requirements analysis. The data warehouse stores all kinds of raw data.

The data will be calculated, loaded and then (if necessary) come the analysis. The calculating velocity of data warehouse is limited. It will consume with the number of resources. And calculating different data sources would be repeated if needed analysis again. If this calculation can be broken down and computed respectively in the data source's server, it will help to reduce the overhead of double counting huge data by using a data access interface. This article introduces a data's visual framework for Big Data and uses the Web visual presentation tool- D3.js to achieve statistics graphical. Maybe this way can reduce the total cost of constructing a large data warehouse. Based on this idea? "First give a right size, properly screened summary, and then display the details needed", interactive visualization graphics will be shown from a different dimension analysis. In the paper, interactive visualization graphics will be demonstrated by the book category dimension, time dimension and other dimensions.

II. BASIC CONCEPTS  D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data [2]. It achieves visualization show by data loading, data binding, analytic transformation elements and excessive element. It is different with Excel, d3 to provide users with a customized mapping rule. According to the needs, users can determine the mapping values to the graphic, such as display color, size. D3 does not support older versions of the browser, so it can make the d3 code clean. D3 is displayed graphical by using CSS3, Hyper Text Markup Language and Scalable Vector Graphics on the Web. D3 is currently the latest version 3.4.4.

D3 is a good at dealing with SVG, which is the World Wide Web Consortium specification specified network vector graphics standard [3]. SVG strict observes XML syntax and use text format's description language to describe the image content. It is a resolution-independent vector and image graphics format [4]. Using SVG to achieve the visual is becoming a new trend.

B. Data Warehouse A data warehouse is a subject-oriented, integrated, time?  characterized and stable point of data collection to support management decision-making in the process [5]. The amount of data in data warehouse is very large, People can be from different dimensions (i.e., the angle of observation of the transaction) to view the data. Data warehouse is using multidimensional data model to storage data.

Multidimensional data model includes dimension tables, fact tables and so on. Dimensional table is used to guide the selection of data from different angles in the fact table. In the multidimensional data model, the user can find the required data in the fact table from different dimensions.

Visualization tools will help people organize and display data.

C. Data visualization The basic idea of data visualization technology is the  database for each data item as a single pixel element represents, then a large number of data sets constitute image of data [6]. Meanwhile using multi-dimensional data to represent each attribute value of data, the data can be observed from different dimensions and used more in-depth observation and analysis. The main purpose of data    2014 IEEE Workshop on Electronics, Computer and Applications  visualization is to convey information by using graphical tools and communicating clearly and effectively. Due to the different degrees of data, Data visualization must implement the zoom feature. At the same time, users can browse or specific knowledge about the data set using the dynamic response graphics[7]. Standard Web technologies for data visualization allow the user who views the statistics on different operating systems by using the newer versions of browsers.

Currently, the visualization techniques have JavaScript, Flash, Java Applet, etc. in the Web front-end. According to different demand, people can select the appropriate demand development tools. For example, to generate a simple chart, Data Wrapper is not a bad choice. Map's mapping can be used Kartofraph. Because JavaScript does not require any plug-in and the user experience is better, so I chose JavaScript.



III. THE FRAMEWORK OF VISUAL ANALYSIS  In the background of large data, I proposed request method of a data visualization data, as shown below by research and analysis of data warehouse costs and construction. As shown in Figurel.

Visual analysis  DalaR?1  > WI? I?:U  Rwxnsand summill'  D ??  Figure 1. visual framework  Each data source can be a small data warehouse in Fig. 1.

Their situation of theme settings is the same. Each data source can be visualized and statistics according to demands.

When making the total statistics, people will propose demands in the first. Then each data source calculates statistical data according to the demands and provide access interface. At the last, data will be returned and summarized and displayed in the browser and stored in the data warehouse. This way can reduce the cost of setting up a large data warehouse. Through the interface, the original data values can also be hidden. So between the data and the user is translucent, not like d3 that is transparent. Based on this idea, a data source for data calculation and visualization can be achieved.



IV. THE IMPLEMENT OF DATA VISUALIZATION IN D3.JS  Currently, there are a lot of various industry sales data.

Data are huge and complex. Single, static tradition "chart? oriented" visual display has been unable to meet the needs of business decision-makers. Through the thought of the data warehouse dimension, interaction diagram of Book sales data will be shown from the books category dimension and time   dimension. The results will help managers find book sales law and adapt the present market demand.

By using D3.js, data visualization will be well achieved and use intuitive vector to replace the traditional form. This article is based on book sales data, by selecting different statistical dimensions, using a pie chart shows the overall profile, with a bar graph showing the specific sales under each dimension.

A. Scheme Design During data storage design, the data are divided into  book-categories dimensions and time dimensions. Book sales table contains sales encoding, book-categories, books-sub? class, book name, price, and sales time six fields. We designed classification code tables for book categories and book sub-classes. It is an important idea for D3.js is not hiding the original data. When the page is loaded, it will push all the data required for book sales to the client, and screening and integrating data base on user's choice. There is no need to sending the request every time you select, this can reduce the burden on the server. The structure of Sales data table is shown in Table 3  TABLE I THE TABLE OF SALES DATA  Field name Type Length Field Description  order no int Order Number  sub no int Categories Number  book name 50 varchar Book name  sales f10at Selling price  time datetime Sales of the time  By "sub_no "we can make the connectIOn between the code table and the fact table to determine the categories of books. Specific processes shown in Figure2:  Figure 2. visual processing    2014 IEEE Workshop on Electronics, Computer and Applications  B. Implementation and Image display When data is transmitted to the front-end, we create  a .ashx files in C #, using List (T) class to access the sales data, and through the method by JavaScriptSerializer transforming data into a JSON, then through Ajax request to obtain all the sales table facts data.

First, create a BookSales class, including Book _ catg, Sub _ catg, Book_name, Sales and S time field. After obtaining the fact that book sales data from the database, we create a listList<BookSales> list = new List<BookSales> (SalesJength);  We can call ToJson (list) function to convert the variable list to JSON format, and pass it on to the front pages.

public string ToJson (object 0) {  JavaScriptSerializer servializer JavaScriptSerializer 0;  return servializer. Serialize (0); }  new  By the following code you can get book sales information in the front-end:  $(document).ready (function 0 { $.post ("request.ashx", function (data) {  Sjson=eval ("(" + data + ")"); } );  });  On the front-end, before using D3.js , we should add a reference like this: <script src="/js/D3.js"></script>0  When we do the analysis in the book category and year, we use a pie chart to display the percentage of total sales in major categories.

First, we need to sort the data according to categories and organize the data as "hierarchical model" structure, with categories for the roots, and "end" for the end.

Then add a listener to each pie incident, the page will display the detail of selected category through a bar chart based on users' demand. When the organized data transmit to sequence.js for visual display, it should also transmit the detail data that is in order to achieve seeing details of the pie.

In this article BookCatg and Years are both using a way of pie chart to bar chart to display.

For example, when clicking the book category to view, the code of implementation and the effect is shown below, and wherein classifY 1 c1assifY2 can be multiplexed to different categories.

aryjs = 0; var m = "Book_catg"; jsonsort(m);f for (var i = 0; i < 1; i++) {  f += parseInt(Sjson. Data[i].Sales); if (i + 1 < I) {  sl = Sjson. data[i].Book _ catg; s2 = Sjson.data[i + l].Book_catg; c1assiJYl (f, sl, s2);   } else if (i+ 1==1) {  }  s 1 = Sj son.data[i] .Book _ catg; s2 = Sjson.data[i - l].Book_catg; c1assiJY2(f, i, s I, s2);  else{ json_txt += '{ "A":'" +Sjson.data[i].Book_catg +'-'+'end'+ '" , "B":'" + f + '" } ]}';}  } Ilfor  Results shown in Figure3:  46.8% ot ... ilOlll(;1:q;i" .. ?  111M ""j..-IIlP'4l"  Figure 3. Result of BookCatg  In the Fig.l, when selecting BookCatg class and putting the mouse on each of the different colors, we can see the book of "Business & Money" accounted for 46.8% of total sales in the upper left corner .Clicking the color, you will get a bar graph shown below. It records the specific sales of per books under the category of "Business & Money" .When the mouse over the bar, you'll see that it belongs Economics that is under the "Business & Money" category. Results shown in Figure 4:  UnilD.l"non.,.,  "' ''  ?I" -'?  J  Figure 4. Result after clicking  When we select Month dimensional analysis performed, front-end data will be arranged according to the year, and then every year's monthly data for statistical analysis to scatter plot a different way to the annual sales of the month with different color display, as shown in Figure 5:    2014 IEEE Workshop on Electronics, Computer and Applications  ""12,44J)  1II1<11,811  illl110,S051  ijlJ(7,287)  1l\3(B, 12?\3[9. 1 1 01  Figure 5. Result of month  fIJI12,!<] ijlJ[II,59[  As shown above, different years will be described with different colors. Users can visually compare the month's different sales, and we can see the fluctuations in sales annually. Such as through the map2014[2,443], you can know the February 2014 sales is 443 dollar.

Finally, View the Overall categories to detail can be viewed separately from each of the proportion of total sales, as shown in Figure 6:  0.460% Dr vi!iil$lq,in with  Ihk kqLJtrM::? vr pAgeS  0.460%  Figure 6. View of overall  When we see from the figure in the navigation bar, this book is named "Proof of Heaven" sales accounted for 0.460% of the total.

By analyzing different dimensions, users can view book sales and income from different angles. Based on the   displaying of graphics, sales trends, it can help managers to make sales management optimization and increase sales.



V. SUMMARY  Statistical methods of data are diverse. Users can choose their own visual display method case by case. The reason why the proposed visual framework is chosen mainly based on the following reasons:  1. D3.js is a library of JavaScript. When using D3.js to visualize, he can directly upgrade to a newer browser version instead of installing plug-ins in the first place.

2. D3.js is used to generate interpreted data. Users can convey important information data by some rules extracted from the data view.

3. The advantage of graphic is to display the statistics from the whole to the details according to demand. Thus this graphic will be interactive visualized.

4. Using SVG graphics will not allow graphic detail view enlarged and distorted.

5. While the original data will not be hidden by D3.js, the approach, using the text of the proposed framework to achieve the translucent data, can not only make it easier for users to statistic data but also reduce the resources and costs to build large-scale data warehouse.

This framework for data visualization, data mining and statistical methods is not comprehensive and may not meet all the needs of users. However, based on the idea in this article, the user can build a framework according to his demand and then develop visual constraints, choose different data dimensions to statistic data.
