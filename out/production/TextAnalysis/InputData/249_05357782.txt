A rough association rule is applicable for  knowledge discovery

Abstract?The traditional association rule which should be fixed in order to avoid both that only trivial rules are retained and also that interesting rules are not discarded. In fact, the situations which use the relative comparison to express are more complete than to use the absolute comparison. Through relative comparison we proposes a new approach for mining association rule, which has the ability to handle the uncertainty in the classing process, so that we can reduce information loss and enhance the result of data mining. In this paper, the new approach can be applied in find association rules, which has the ability to handle the uncertainty in the classing process and suitable for all data types.

I. INTRODUCTION Many algorithms have been proposed for mining Boolean  association rules. However, very little work has been done m mining quantitative association rules. Although we can transform quantitative attributes into Boolean attributes, this approach Is not effective and is difficult to scale up for high-dimensional cases and also may result m many imprecise association rules [1].The application of association rules is not limited to marketing problems: in fact they can shed light on a wide range of knowledge discovery and decision making problems. The basic problem of mining association rules is then to generate all association rules A ? B that have support and confidence greater than user-specified thresholds [5].

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 the traditional Apriori algorithm. Section 3 the problem statement. Section 4 new algorithms modified from Apriori algorithm. Closing remarks and future work are presented in Sect. 5.



II. TRADITIONAL APRIORI ALGORITHM Make the item set, in which each item  represents a specific literal. D stands for a set of transactions in a database in which each transaction T represents an item set such that . That is, each item set T is a non-empty sub-item set of I. The association rules are an implication of the form X Y, where X I,Y I and X Y =  }iii{I m,2,1 ??  IT ?  ? ? ? ? ? . The rule X Y holds in the transaction set D according to two measurement standards - support and confidence. Support (denoted as Sup(X,D)) represents the rate of transactions in D  containing the item set X. Support is used to evaluate the statistical importance of D, and the higher its value, the more important the transaction set D is [4]. Fig.1 presents the process of traditional Apriorial inference.

III. PROBLEM STATEMENT  A. From the angle of discussing Support and Confidence There are many different algorithms to discover association  rules from various data types. First, Boolean attributes, which represent the items, are assumed to have only two values. If an item is in a transaction, the corresponding attribute value will be 1; otherwise, the value will be 0. By assuming that a variable may have more than two statuses, Boolean attributes can be generalized to nominal attributes. Many interesting and efficient algorithms have been proposed for mining association rules from Boolean or nominal data, such as Apriori and DHP. _____________________________     Second, since quantitative data are popular in practical databases, a natural extension is finding association rules from quantitative data. To solve this problem, previous research partitioned the value of a quantitative attribute into a set of intervals, so that the traditional algorithms for nominal data could be applied [2].

In mining association rules the two important measures are the support and the confidence. In generally, the mining of association rules is divided into two phases: finding frequent itemsets with support above a threshold, and finding rules with confidence above a threshold [3]. For example (table1), the minimum support is assumed to be30% and the minimum confidence is assumed to be 50%.

Table1: Sample data set Attribute DecisionNo  Age Gender Shopping frequency Brand loyalty t1 20~29 Male Once a month High t2 30~39 Female Under fortnightly Low t3 20~29 Male Once a month High t4 20~29 Female Once a month Median t5 10~19 Male other Low t6 10~19 Male fortnightly Low t7 30~39 Female Under fortnightly Median t8 10~19 Male other Low t9 20~29 Male Once a month High t10 30~39 Female Under fortnightly Median  The support, confidence and lift value of the traditional association rule are defined as below.

Rules express the relation between pairs of items and are defined in two measures: support and confidence. Most techniques for finding association rule scan the whole data set, evaluate all possible rules and retain only rules that have support and confidence greater than thresholds. It?s mean that the situations which use the absolute comparison. Actually, it?s not reasonable. For instance, if we raise the threshold of support to 50%, we can not find the association rule?a male who is 20~29 and go to shopping once a month has high brand loyalty. The traditional association rule which should be fixed in order to avoid both that only trivial rules are retained and also that interesting rules are not discarded. In fact, the situations which use the relative comparison to express are more complete than to use the absolute comparison. Through relative comparison we proposes a new approach for mining association rule, which has the ability to handle the uncertainty in the classing process, so that we can reduce information loss and enhance the result of data mining.

The remaining transactions can still be partitioned into those that actually violate the rule, and those which do not carry any relevant information [5].

B. From the angle of information disclosure The ordinal data sets and Boolean data types are as table2  and table3. First, if we want to know a male who is 20~25 and go to purchasing Coca-cola. The one situation is the male just buying Coca-cola, and the other situation is the male who is buying both Coca-cola and Pepsi.

Using the traditional association rule for data mining, first to count value of )colaCoca25~20male(Support ??? .

Then to count value of )Pepsi25~20male(Support ?? .

Finally, the same customer is the one who is buying both Coca-cola and Pepsi  Table2: ordinal data set No Gender Age Purchasing product 001 Male 20 Coca-cola & Pepsi 002 Female 23 Pepsi 003 Female 17 Pepsi 004 Male 30 Coca-cola 005 Male 22 Coca-cola & Pepsi  Table3: Data types (Boolean attributes) Gender Age Purchasing product  No Male Female Under 20 20~25 26~30 Coca-cola Pepsi  001 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 002 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 003 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 004 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 005 1 0 0 1 0 1 1  According to the basic concepts of support and confidence, there are four situations to mining association rule.

IV. METHODOLOGY As fig.4, fig.5 and fig.10 to fig.13 is not applicable for  tradition association rules of mining that have support and confidence greater than user-specified threshold. For example, the sample data set just has set A and set B. Set A occupies most of the sample date set (70%), and the remainder is set B.

If we determining the degree of min support of 40%, we can not find the association rule?about set B. If we decrease the threshold of min support to 2%, we get too much association rules?about set B.

In other words, the excessively low min support will generate too many association rules. And the excessively high min support will bring too few association rules. Many decision makers are persecuted by using tradition rules when determining the degree of support.

In order to solve the kind of problem, the aim of the research is to provide a new association rule concept, which is  using Bayesian network. The new association rule algorithm is show as below.

From the angle of information disclosure, compares with the traditional association rules, decision maker can get more information from Bayesian association rules.

When we get marketing survey, how to use the algorithm is as below, which include both rough set theory and Bayesian theory.
