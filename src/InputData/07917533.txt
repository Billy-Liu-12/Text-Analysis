Proposal of Hardware Device Model for IoT Endpoint Security and Its Implementation

Abstract?Recently, various devices begin to connect the Inter- net owing to the spread of IoT (Internet of Things). Introduction of IoT technology is progressing also for industrial systems such as plants for the purpose of improving cost efficiency.

So, it has become an urgent matter to establish new security countermeasures. But it is not able to respond to some new incidents due to differences in performance or operation between IoT and conventional ICT systems. In some cases, device?s stability is more important than the data it self. Therefore, we consider that the security measure from a new viewpoint becomes important. In this paper, we describe the scope of preceding study and hardware security problem that has never been studied. Furthermore, we show the result of load test and impact on output signals under DoS attack. And we propose and implement a new hardware device that can detect DoS attack by only observing electrical signals in the circuit as the countermeasure. Lastly, we explain the contents of the demonstration that implements our proposed method.



I. INTRODUCTION  As IoT (Internet of Things) technologies are more widely used in many way, the number of devices that connect to the Internet continue to grow explosively. According to the certain survey, less than 20 billion things will be connected to network[1]. Particularly in the industrial field, it aims to improve the efficiency and sophistication by adopting IoT techniques. Gartner, Inc. says that total number of IoT devices used industrial field will increase 6.3 times during 2014 - 2020 period [2]. As typified by Industrie 4.0 or Industrial Internet, various projects are promoted all over the world [3][4].

On the other hand, a threat of cyber attacks is becoming a serious problem because many devices that used in stand- alone until now will connect to external network. So, it is urgently necessary to improve security measures. However, there are several problems in considering these security mea- sures. A serious problem is that we can not use many security measures and methods for conventional ICT (Information and communication technology) system as it is. Because there are some large differences between IoT devices and conven- tional computers which mainly consist of PCs in terms of performance, operation and so on. It is likely to cause serious impact problems if the cyber attack succeeds on the control system that used industrial field or infrastructure. For example, Ukrainian power grid came under cyber attack on December 2015. As a result of this attack, massive power outage hits Ukrainian wide area [5].

Because the IoT devices used industrial are required to minimize the performance from the viewpoint of cost problems, and frequently update of software is difficult. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a new method of attack detection that can be easily implemented even at the endpoint IoT device.

In this paper, we focus on the IoT device that used in endpoint of industrial control system as shown in Figure 1.

In the beginning, we indicate the summary of preceding study field and new problems that have not been pointed out. In order to evaluate hardware level security problem, we obsolete impact on output signals under DoS attack. Then, we propose a new attack detection method to observe electrical signals in the circuit as the solution to the problem. Finally, we show the details of a demonstration.



II. SCOPE OF PRECEDING STUDY AND PROBLEM  In this section, we describe the scope of preceding study and hardware security problem that has never been studied.

A. Preceding studies  Referring to preceding studies [6][7], we show the major differences in security between the industrial control system and conventional ICT systems in table I. There are some remarkable differences between the two as shown in this      TABLE I COMPARISON OF INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEM AND CONVENTIONAL ICT SYSTEM  Industrial control system Conventional ICT system Priority availability of system confidentiality of information  Main target of security thing (facility, product) data Frequency of update 10-20year 3-5year  Continuous operating time uninterrupted operation during business hours Constraints of processing time ? strict real-time some delay is acceptable  Communication protocol ? limited Wide variety Network configuration relatively simple complexity  (a) Nomal state (b) Under DoS attack Fig. 2. Effect on output signal  Table. Mainstream of preceding studies aim to improve and adapt security technology used in conventional ICT system to control system. For example, taking advantage of the feature that network configuration tends to be simple, a flow whitelist method that improved on the conventional whitelist method was proposed by Rafeal et al [8].

B. Security focused on hardware level  Many of the preceding studies focus on the data that exchange between devices in the network like conventional ICT system. However, in the industrial control system, it seems that safety of the system itself is more important than confi- dentiality data. If an unintentional malfunction were to occur machine tool by cyber attack, there would be a high possibility of serious damaging human life and property. Therefore, it seems that securing stability and safety of the device under some attacks will become important in the future. We assumed that even if the cyber attack did not affect contents of the data, it could affect some output signals. If the output signal is adversely affected by attack, it is assumed that malfunction occurs and adversely affects the entire system.

To verify this hypothesis, we performed the DoS (Denial of Service) attack against Arduino Uno to aim at placing a high load on device. In this fundamental experiment, we implement using Arduino standard libraries, and observed the PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signal from the device.

The results of observing the PWM signal from the device for a period are shown in Figure 2. From this figure, the effect of attacks such as increasing the jitter width and the frequency was confirmed under the attack. We also confirmed that processing and response speed were affected under the attack. It is considered that IoT devices are more susceptible to processing load because performance is limited compared with general computers. Although the impact of this attack  Communication controller (ex. Ethernet controller)  Main device  Attack Detection Unit  ???  Bus connection (ex. Serial communication)  Control signal (ex. PWM)  Monitoring of signal  Alert  Actuator Sensor  etc  External network  Proposed part  Fig. 3. Overview of proposed method  for the one device was limited, it is possible that a serious problem may occur in a system where multiple devices are affected.



III. PROPOSED SOLUTION  It is difficult to implement security measures at the endpoint by adding new software, because many IoT devices have limited its capacity and performance. We also thought we needed a way to improve the security of existing products without much cost. Therefore, we propose a new hardware device that can detect DoS attack by observing only electrical signals in the circuit, as a countermeasure to the problem described in the previous section. Figure 3 shows our proposed method. This method detects abnormality by observing the physical characteristics of the bus communication between the communication controller and the main device.

Features of this method are shown below.

? The implementation is simple and relatively inexpensive  because it doesn?t need to analyze contents of data.

? This method dose not affect the processing of main device  because the attack detection unit is independent from main device.

? Available for various devices that have communication controller.

We show an example of implementing this method in Arduino UNO.

Average voltage variation of the bus communication  and communication controller (Ethernet shield) is done by SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface). We could detect abnormality by observing the flowing signal in this section as analog voltage. We found that the average voltage becomes low within a certain section under attack. The observation result of the change in the average voltage variation of the bus communication is shown in the Figure 4.

If the average voltage always falls below a certain reference value in a certain section, it can be regarded that an abnor- mality has occurred in the system. From this result, we have confirmed that abnormality can be detected by observing the average voltage of the bus communication section.



IV. DEMONSTRATION  Our demonstration shows two aspect; (i) Confirm the effect of DoS attack on IoT device and (ii) Detection of attack by proposed method.

As shown in Figure 5, environment for our demonstration consists of 6 degrees of freedom robot arm controlled by Arduino, communication device for sending instruction to other devices, and attacker device. In this demonstration, an attacking device intrudes into the communication between the robot arm and the communion device and performs a DoS attack on the robot arm. Arduino that connected to the robot arm has functions as simple server and arm controller by multitask processing. We will plan to use Ethernet between Arduino (controlling the robot arm) and the communication device.

First of our demonstration, we will confirm that the attack affects the operation of the robot arm. We will use an attacker device for attacks, and this attack content will be a simple flood-besed DoS attack that sends a large amount of HTTP requests. In this attack, we will aim at loading Arduino?s pro- cessing system which controls the robot arm. The purpose of this demonstration is to show that it can affect the processing of the device without modifying the data and analysing of control protocol for robot arm. After that, we will show that it is possible to detect the attack by adding the device that implemented the proposed method to Arduino controlling the robot arm. We plan to implement the proposed method in  Attacker device Communication  device  6 degree of freedom robot arm  Fig. 5. Demonstration equipment  a form compatible with Sheild?s standard used in Arduino.

Therefore, it can be easily added to existing Arduino products.



V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK  In this paper, we focus on the security of an IoT device which is used in endpoints of industrial control system. We show the result of load test and impact on output signals under DoS attack. And we propose and implement a new hardware device that can detect DoS attack by observing only electrical signals in the circuit as the countermeasure.

As a future work, it is necessary to confirm the false detection rate and the introduction cost when this method is applied to an actual system. We also have to discuss the appropriate decision method of thresholds for judging attacks.

In addition, we consider that the observing voltage method can only detect relatively simple attacks. So, in order to detect more advanced attack, we need to verify attack detection methods using physical characteristics other than voltage.
