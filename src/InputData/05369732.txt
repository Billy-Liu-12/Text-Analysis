Analysis of Discipline Development Discrepancy between the Provincial Cities of  China Based on Output of Scientific Papers

Abstract?Scientific paper is a key factor representing the degree of discipline development in a city or a country. Based on the database of Web of Science we comparatively analyzed the outputs of the scientific papers, indexed by Science Citation Index, between 31 provincial cities of China in 10 disciplines of natural science during 2005?2007. The paper quantities for each city as well as the whole country were steadily growing at this stage. The political center Beijing and the economic center Shanghai shared 27.3% and 13.2% of all scientific papers published by these cities, respectively. In contrast, each of the ranked last 13 cities had only a share of lower than 1%. Our data indicated that there were big discrepencies between the provincial cities of China for the development of the disciplines investigated.

I.  INTRODUCTION Science and technology is well known to be the most  powerful drive for social and economic development. Most of the results of research work in all disciplines are embodied as scientific papers, patents, academic reports and other scientific materials, among which scientific papers are generally conceived to be a key factor [1]. Thus, a statistic analysis of scientific papers, published by a country or a city, is helpful to understand their statuses of discipline development and to further estimate their scientific and technological strengths [2].

The number of scientific papers at a certain period can be easily calculated whereas their qualities are hard to be evaluated. The quality of a paper is often estimated by a few parameters such as impact factor of citation [3] and citation frequency [4]. By using these parameters, Journal Citation Reports, published every year since 1975 by American Institute of Science and Technology Information, has performed a relatively objective evaluation for scientific papers published in a country or a specific discipline.

In China, the provincial cities are nearly the key regions of economic development and the center of scientific research for each province or municipalities [5]. To understand the current statuses of the discipline development in 31 provincial cities of China, we retrieved the database of Web of Science (WOS) for obtaining the information of  scientific papers in 10 disciplines of natural science during 2005?2007 and comparatively analyzed the discrepancies of the paper quantities between these cities.



II. METHODS All of scientific papers, indexed by Science Citation  Index (SCI), were obtained via retrieving the WOS database.

The rank of a city in a specific subject of a discipline was estimated based on the total number of scientific papers in this subject [6]. The final rank of a city was then obtained according to the mathematical formula:  R=?(S1 + S2 + ?????? + Sn)/n Note that R, S and n represent the final rank, the  numerical value of rank for a specific subject, and the subject number of a discipline, respectively. The final ranks obtained were used to access the degrees of discipline development for the 31 principal cities of China selected.



III. RESULTS  A. Total number of scientific papers of China during 2005?2007 Based on the statistic data of scientific papers indexed by  SCI, the total numbers for China were steadily increasing during the three years, though the growth rate in 2006 was relatively lower (Table I).

City ranks in each discipline The ranks of the 31 provincial cities in each of the 10  disciplines investigated were obtained based on the quantity of their scientific papers in a discipline published during 2005?2007. As shown in Table 2, the capital city Beijing had the largest number of scientific papers in each discipline and thus ranked first. The economic center Shanghai ranked second in most of the disciplines except Agriculture and Mathematics & Multidisciplinary. However, the five provincial cities of Huhehaote, Xining, Yinchuan, Haikou   DOI 10.1109/ICIII.2009.461    DOI 10.1109/ICIII.2009.461     and Lhasa ranked the last five positions in nearly all of the 10 disciplines.

C. Comprehensive ranks of the provincial cities The numbers of scientific papers, within 163 specific  subjects of the 10 disciplines during 2005?2007, were summed up for a city to estimate its final comprehensive rank in the 31 provincial cities. The paper numbers increased year by year nearly for every city (Table 3), resulting in an overall increase of scientific papers of China (Table 1). Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan and  Hangzhou ranked orderly the top five cities (Table 3) whose publication contributed to 58% of the total number of scientific papers published by the 31 cities during 2005? 2007. However, the last 20 cities had only a contribution of 20.8%. In particular, each of the last 13 cities had a contribution of lower than 1%. In contrast, Beijing and Shanghai had relatively high contributions of 27.3% and 13.2%, respectively, suggesting that the two cities have the     best and solidest researching capabilities in comparison with other Chinese cities.

IV. CONCLUSION For the 31 provincial cities as well as the whole country  of China, the quantities of scientific papers were steadily growing during 2005?2007, suggesting that the strength of science and technology for China was progressively strengthened in recently years. But it should be noted that the development of disciplines in natural science had an unneglectable discrepency between the cities: the political center Beijing (with 69,001 papers during 2005?2007) and the economic center Shanghai (with 33,549 papers) had  27.3% and 13.2% of all scientific papers investigated, respectively, which were overwhelmingly higher than those of other cities; in contrast, each of the ranked last 13 cities from Zhengzhou to Lasa had only a share of lower than 1%.

The discrepency of discipline development between these cities may together caused by several factors such as economic, policy, history and geographical position and conditions, etc., among which regional economic success and policy tendency undoubtedly act as the direct drives for the current development of science and technology.
