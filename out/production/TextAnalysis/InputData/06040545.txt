I.  INTRODUCTION Digital is a worldwide new technology revolution, it is an  inevitable trend in the development of broadcasting and television. In broadcasting and television field,  currently, a major trend that is from analog transmission to digital transmission. Digital broadcasting and TV industry has also become the industry focus. 2006 October 24, the state administration of radio, film formally promulgated the China mobile multimedia broadcasting (CMMB) industry standard, determined as the mobile multimedia broadcasting industry standard. After four years of development, now, every municipality directly under the central government, provincial has established CMMB operating companies. CMMB Operating companies and the establishment of the user to service the surge in demand, boosting China's mobile digital multimedia broadcasting's fast development. So far, CMMB wireless network are being built, good broadcasting network is CMMB one of the keys to success[1][2].

CMMB wireless network construction must carry on the network design, planning and optimization, it must undertake CMMB wireless work testing and analysis of network, so CMMB will be widely used, it is means must intensify analysis, solve this problem. When the network construction took shape, then it into a cycle of construction, road test, analyze, optimize the construction process. Only by constantly  analyze network, it can cause the network in the best resource utilization next to a higher customer satisfaction. Network analysis is the actual operation system in the process of an essential job. At present, in view of the laboratory testing instruments and high-end test instrument expensive faults, it can use software and databases unifies, using data mining association rules technical analysis wireless network  test data, it can provide reliable basis for CMMB network optimization.



II. ASSOCIATION RULES Data mining is from a lot of, incomplete, noisy, fuzzy and  random data, extract implicit in them, people don't know in advance, but it is potential useful information and knowledge of the process. Association rule mining is from a database search itemsets between meaningful connection or related links. It is an important technology in data mining, in recent years, it is widely used in various fields. The essence of association rules is extract correlation from large amounts of data or object, it can reveal dependencies between the data, according to the correlation, we can get the object information from another data object information. Association rules not only can be directly discovered correlation between the arbitrary itemsets from database, but also can be found implied information from data. This correlation is not dependent on a particular distribution, it is rely on the data in a particular model after multiple iterative fitting, and it is building according to the itemsets in data appeared in probability[3].

Therefore, it is different from the traditional statistics method, its advantage is clear and easy to explain the results.

(1) 1 2{ , , , }mI i i i= ? is a collection. Assumes the task of the relevant data D is database transaction collections, which each transaction is a collection of T, make T I? . Every transaction has a identifier, called TID, As shown Table 1.

TABLE 1 THE TID REPRESENTATION  TID Item list 1 i1,i2 2 i1,i3,i5 3 i2,i3,im  ? ? m i1,i3,im  This work was supported by the ?Science and Technology Research Project of? Chongqing municipal education commission? under contract no.KJ101114 and no.KJ111103     (2) Association rules is like a containing type X = > Y, its X I? , andY I? , X, Y respectively called the premise and  the conclusion from association rules X = > Y. Rules X = > Y is establishment in affairs set D,  which has support for S, S is D affairs of contains X Y? ,  it is probability P(X )Y? , if D contains X affairs it contains both Y percentage is c, the rules X = > Y in affairs set D has confidence c. This is conditional probability ( )P Y X . namely:  The support degree of the item sets X? Y called support degree of association rules X=>Y, written for support(X=>Y).

suppport(X=>Y)=support(X )=P(X )Y Y? ? The confidence of association rules X=>Y is written for  confidence(X=>Y)?  support(X Y)confidence(X=>Y)= ( ) support(X)  P Y X=?  (3) Frequent itemsets is refers to meet user given support degree program sets. The key work of the association rules mining is find all the frequent itemsets. The minimum support degrees threshold(minsupport) is expressed minimum importance on the statistical sense. The minimum confidence degrees threshold(mincofidence) is expressed minimum reliability[4][5].



III. CMMB WIRELESS NETWORK TESTING SYSTEM AND TEST DATA PROCESSING  A. CMMB wireless network testing system and data acquisition In order to analysis CMMB wireless network, We must  first get all kinds of data from the network, so, it must establish CMMB wireless network test system. Along the road test using a series of test equipment called road test system. It is using space model analysis method based on the geographical spatial database to offers a variety of space dynamic real-time information. It basically is always test longitude and latitude, space planning, graphic structure, weather conditions and other information. CMMB wireless network road test system mainly consists of test vehicles, GPS, receiving antenna and the Japan Shinbashi company of CMMB signal analyzer Tx701A, and testing acquisition software. As shown Figure 1.

Figure 1. wireless network road test system of data acquisition  Graphical User Interface(GUI) mainly includes: Map and the wireless network road test data real-time display, the figure of measurement data. The data from GPS and CMMB tester measurements put in a new file for offline analysis used. The  contents of the file include: time, Time, latitude and longitude, altitude, speed, the signal level, signal-to-noise ratio, RS mistakenly piece rate, synchronization, frequency offset, multipath, MER and EVM etc.

B. Data conversion Association rules mining normally applied in the  recording index take discrete values. Test data is continuous fields, so, we need to transform data, to convert data suitable for data mining form. Before association rule mining, we should discrete data(essence: a particular interval value corresponds to a value). Data discretization of data mining is an important steps, before the discretization process whether reasonable, it will directly influence of association rule mining results.

How to divide the interval is the key to realize the continuous data to the discrete data transforms. There are two key problems: When interval differentiate limits is too narrow, it will causes each interval corresponding attribute support is very low, and appear "minimum support degree problem", Namely because this classification causes many alternatives can not reach the minimum support degree, so that the corresponding association rule cannot be exhumed; Conversely, when interval is too wide range, it will make each interval corresponding attribute the credibility of low, and appear "minimum credibility problem", Namely many alternatives can not reach the minimum confidence makes corresponding association rules were abandoned, it will cause reduce rules, and rule contains information will also reduces correspondingly. Considering the above two factor to divide space, But how to reasonably and effectively division attribute interval, and it can reflect this attribute data in the actual distribution in the domain is the key to mining the quantitative attributes association rule. This paper adopts equally spaced, each interval power level 3dbm and each interval signal-to- noise ratio 2db.



IV. ASSOCIATED DATA MINING Association rules algorithm is to realize the function  "Aprior" data mining algorithm. The SNR, the signal level, incorrect piece rate form wireless network road testing is a continuous signal, We must discretization of data according to the interval segmentation. In the CMMB wireless network, the signal-to-noise ratio and the signal level is higher, the signal quality is better. This is a standard of inspection the credibility of the table which frequently sets L1={signal-to-noise ratio, the signal level, mistakenly piece rate}.

First of all, we must remove the interference data, then, discretization data according to data range, and establish the topic for SNR, the signal level and Error Block rate. So we can get credibility table, set suitable credibility threshold, obtain the contain relationship between signal level, signal-to-noise and the error block rate. Finally, we will deposit the data from relation table into database.

A. Improved "Apriori" algorithm The main ideas of the "Apriori" algorithm: First of all,  find all the frequent itemsets, Namely, the itemsets when    "support"?"minsupportL". Then, Through the user of the given "inconfidence", we can looking for association rules when "confidence"?"minconfidence".

From the database, we can seen CMMB wireless network test data is multidimensional and multilayer. Due to the "Apriori" algorithms only in integrated data model of monolayer on mining, do not suit for multidimensional data model for mining multi-layered. We want to analysis the wireless network test data(signal level, signal-to-noise ratio, error block rate), it must improve the "Apriori" algorithm.

The improved algorithm "Apriori" thoughts are as follows:  Calculation process is as follows: S1: Ll =find_ frequent _1-itemset(D);// Scan data set D, find  out all of set L1 which is Frequent itemsets 1- S2: for(k=2; 1kL ? ? ? ;k++) { S3: Ck =apriori_gen( Lk-1,minsuppport); S4?Ttotal=0 S5 ? for each transaction t D? {// When scanning D  conducted affairs, candidate counting S6?Ct=subset(Ck?t);     // Gets all the candidate set by  affairs t generated S7? c.count++? }        // The candidate set in each candidate  counting add 1  S8? .{ min sup }k k  c coutL c C port D  = ? ?  S:9?Ttotal ++;} S:10?Confidence=Lk / Ttotal;Support=c.count/Lk  B. The realize of analysis CMMB wireless network test data First, produce frequent 1- itemsets L1. The frequently sets  L1 = {signal level, signal-to-noise ratio, error block rate}. The test data as shown Figure 2.

Figure 2. The test data in the database  CMMB network analysis system for data mining, the first should be cleared irrelevant data. This process is selected helpful data from database and discarded extraneous data, then, Put the data into a associated data mining need form.

According to the Beijing CMMB single frequency network testing data, Grading SNR, the signal level, error block rate, Setting threshold, SNR classification as shown table 2 .

TABLE 2 THE TABLE OF CLASSIFICATION FOR SNR  The classification of SNR Numerical range (SNR) 1 SNR>15 2 13<SNR?15 3 11<SNR?13 4 9<SNR?11 5 7<SNR?9 6 5<SNR?7 7 SNR?5  The signal level classification as shown table 3 .

TABLE 3 THE TABLE OF CLASSIFICATION FOR THE SIGNAL LEVEL  The classification of signal level Numerical range(PWR) 1 PWR>-75 2 -78<PWR?-75 3 -81<PWR?-78 4 -84<PWR?-81 5 -87<PWR?-84 6 -90<PWR?-87 7 PWR?-90  The error block rate classification as shown table 4 .

TABLE 4 THE TABLE OF CLASSIFICATION FOR ERROR BLOCK RATE  The classification of error block rate  Numerical range (BLER) Signal quality  1 BLER?0.005 excellent 2 0.005< BLER?0.15 good 3 0.15< BLER?0.5 generally 4 BLER>0.5 poor  According to the setting threshold, powerlevel=-90,SNR =5, Improved "Apriori" algorithm project set: I={{SNR1, SNR2, ?... SNR7},{ Signal level 1, signal level 2,??Signal level 7},{ excellent, good, generally, poor }}. The '111' means SNR?15, POWERLEVEL?-75, at this time, RS_BLER ? 0.005. When A = {SNR1, signal level 1}, B = {excellent}, A = > B of the containing type means rules: When the signal level than - 75, SNR more than 15, signal quality is good. So only through the signal level and signal-to-noise ratio can be determined signal coverage.

From the above analysis can see, various mining parameters settings will effect the system efficiency and produce rules. Users can according to their specific needs, set up various parameters, getting what you want mining results.



V. TEST ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS According to the threshold from mining, according to the  threshold table, We can get the signal-to-noise score layer figure from signal-to-noise data. As shown Figure 3.

Through the EXCEL draw SNR range of percentage figure.

As shown Figure 4. We can see from the graph, the percentage is 82.71% when the SNR> SNR threshold 13.

According to the threshold table, we can get the power level layer figure from power level data. As shown Figure 5.

Through the EXCEL draw power level range of percentage figure. As shown Figure 6. We can see from the graph, the    percentage is 91.48% when power level > power level threshold -75.

Figure 3 Signal-to-noise Layered figure   Figure 4 SNR percentage figure   Figure5 Power level Layered figure    Similarly, we can get RS error block rate scope percentage and signal quality percentage.

In practical application, we can use lower functional testing instruments, such as only measuring signal level and signal-to-noise ratio. According to the threshold, we can be judged signal quality stand or fall through analyzed the data and can optimize the poor signal area. If the signal of poor area is larger, it is needed to add repeater. After optimization network, we are still need to testing wireless network and analysis data, So as to achieve optimal effect.

The main parameters for covered test are receive power and signal-to-noise ratio. But just depend on network covering power value evaluation is far from enough. The stronger power network performance is better, this is the earliest analog networks used method, for now the complex and changeable wireless network will no longer be valid. In current network analysis and design,  if you want to know exactly what the transmitter cover performance. You must test and analyze the system's receiving power and SNR, error block rate, and so on, and adjust network according to the test result. Such as add repeater in large area covering the place with bad. Designated for network interference analysis in the signal strength with high or Signal to Noise Ratio with high but receiving quality is bad.

In practical application, we can use different methods to test different areas and divide the area into urban and suburban areas. Using this paper?s methods to analyzes the different area, we can get corresponding parameters threshold table. It is more accurate to determine network covering the quality situation, help optimize network.
