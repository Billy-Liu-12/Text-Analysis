I. INTRODUCTION  Introduction of  RFID technology RFID is a generic technology concept that refers to the use of radio waves to identify objects. RFID is a non-contact interrogation method for identification of objects. An RFID system essentially consists of three parts: the RFID tag itself, the RFID reader device, and a backend information management system. The RFID tag consists of a silicon chip that can hold a certain amount of data (such as a unique identification number), and an antenna that is used to communicate with the remote reader device. The reader device communicates with the RFID tag by means of sending and receiving radio frequency waves [1] .

Many of us are unaware of the fact that we are surrounded with applications of radio frequency identification (RFID). It has affected our daily lives in many different aspects. RFID developed and improved fast during 1970s and 80s. More applications took place in the 1980s.

Most common implementations during decade were tracking of animals and vehicles. RFID was also used in factory automation. [2] RFID can be used in supply chain to improve inventory control. The use of RFID should greatly reduce the level of shrinkage that occurs in the supply chain  by providing increased visibility of individual cases of product. [14] These applications provide security, safety and convenience. We can use RFID in preventing auto and merchandise theft, collecting tolls without stopping, managing traffic, controlling access to buildings, gates and more. So RFID technology has been widely adopted for supply chain management purposes. Its inherent identification capabilities provide the opportunity to trace products from the producer to the retailer, offering insight to the various levels of the supply chain [3].  In a word, the introduction of RFID changed the data gathering mode rather than the Application Business.

B. Introduction of  RFID Middleware With the development of RFID applications, the rapidly increasing number of companies actively participated in the RFID system development and the increasing sales record of RFID systems and the RFID devices which adopt the different communications protocol. Facing the various applications of RFID, the enterprises meet the first question that is how to make the existing information system to connect the RFID reader.  The essence of the question is the interface between the application system and hardware of RFID. So, the key is how to get the accurate data and ensure the reliability of the data. The traditional method of Application to Application is to use middleware. In a similar way, the solution of middleware architecture is the core technology.

RFID Middleware is a new breed of software system which facilitates data communication between automatic identification equipments like RFID readers and enterprise applications. Recently, the development of RFID Middleware technology has become very active in various fields such as manufacturing companies and material flow systems. Also, the researches for RFID Middleware systems have been performed continuously and the related software packages have appeared in the market. The rapidly increasing number of companies actively participated in the RFID system develop and the increasing sales record of RFID systems show the importance of RFID middleware systems.[4] Fig.1 shows RFID Middleware System Architecture.

RFID Middleware systems receive tag data from variable RFID readers that identify and read RFID tag and collect, filter, and a group of tag data to transmit the processed tag data to application program such as WMS, ERP. The responsibility of RFID Middleware systems is to collect and filter the received tag data, and deliver the filtered tag data to applications programs. In RFID system, the middleware is a sort of software that resides between the RFID readers and enterprise applications. The middleware takes the raw data from the reader, filter it and passes on the useful event data to back-end systems. Tag data that middleware handles can be information that is involved in individual's privacy, or has important value of corporations.

[5] The second finger show the functions of RFID Middleware  Fig. 2 the functions of RFID Middleware  The heart of the utility is that RFID makes gathering information about physical objects easy. Middleware plays a key role to deliver tag data in real time, which resides between readers and enterprise applications in RFID Systems. Therefore, the data management of RFID Middleware is very important. This paper emphasized this model which is shown in Fig. 3.

Fig.3  RFID Middle Data management model  The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we present the background of the RFID Middleware.

Section 3 introduces the improvement of transposition cipher adopted by RFID Middleware to increase the data security. Section 4 introduces RFID Middleware using the compression algorithm in order that RFID tag can store more data. Section 5 tests the performance of RFID middleware Finally, In Section 6   concludes s this paper.



II. THE BACKGROUND OF RFID MIDDLEWARE  Sun, IBM, BEA, SAP, Oracle, i-Konect, etc. introduced their RFID Middleware products. And some research groups also propose their solutions, such as the E-Business Technology Institute (ETI) of the University of Hong Kong, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, etc. SUN-MEE PARK proposed that the RFID Middleware system supporting priority service with the Buffer Management Component consists of the Reader Interface Component, the Buffer Management Component, the ALE Component and the EPCIS Component. Buffer management component consists of the buffers that buffer the received tag data and the buffer manager that gives the different priorities to the buffers in processing the tag data in the buffers. Also, the buffer manager provides the time managing, priority managing and data size managing functions. [6] Each RFID Middleware has respective characteristics.

But they don?t deal the RFID tag data in terms of data security and compression to increase the quantity of storing data.

III THE RESEARCH OF RFID MIDDLEWARE?S DATA SECURITY  Although many methods were introduced to guarantee to data security of RFID tag, most of them come down to the hardware.[7] From the view of software, we use the authentication of RFID reader and the method of data encryption. The authentication of RFID reader which is the first security safeguard is to defend the RFID data which can?t be identified by the wrongful reader ,that can be achieved by giving the reader a label of ?right:? item, which write the right of RFID reader. When the RFID reader send the request of reading the RFID tag, the RFID Middleware firstly verify the right of reader, if the ?right? item is  one , the reader can read the RFID tag, or the reader is rejected and closed. The data encryption protects the RFID data which can be identified by the unlawful reader. The mechanism of data encryption can be described as follows.

[8]  },,,,{ DEKCPS =                   1 P  expresses the space of plaintext C  expresses the space of ciphertext K  is the key or the space of key E  is Encryption Algorithm D  is Decryption Algorithm If the key is K, the Encryption and Decryption Algorithm  can be used by Ek and Dk, then  Cryptosystem can be described as follows:  },,,,{ KKK DEKCPS =            (2) )(PEC K=                       (3)     ))(()( PEDCDP KKK ==          (4) 1?  KE  is  the Inverse Function of KE 11and ?? == KKKK DEED       (5)  Equation 3 shows that P is encrypted by the Ek to equal ciphertext C  Equation 4 show C is decrypted by the Dk to equal plaintext P  The classical encryption Algorithm has two type : replacement encryption and transposition encryption. The replacement encryption is to replace the char of plaintext by the other char, number and so on, but the position of each char is not changed. The transposition encryption is to disorder the plaintext and the chars are not changed. In other words, the plaintext can be input a picture and the other order chars are output shown in Fig. 4:  Fig. 4  the description of Encryption Algorithm  Because the capacity of tag is limited, the store space of the ciphertext is must be considered and it is possible that the key table is very big in order to reduce the query speed.

So this system adopted improved the transposition encryption and used two step encryption. The first step is the transposed transposition encryption. The string can be encrypted by the transposition and one M X 4 matrix is built in which M based on the capacity of tag, for example, the capacity of tag is 256 chars, then M=256/4=64, according the transposition encryption, the ciphertext C1 can be accepted. The second step is binary transposition encryption that makes each binary char of C1 invert order transposition encryption. For example the ASCII of ?r? is 114, the binary of r is ?01110010?, then inversed ?01110010? and the other binary ?01001110? can be obtained. The decimal number is 78, which is the char of ?N?. Repeated the procedure, the full string can be encrypted as shown in Fig. 5.

Fig.5 the encrypted string process  IV THE RESEARCH OF RFID MIDDLEWARE?S DATA COMPRESSION  The data compression can be mainly divided loseless compression and losssy compression. To ensure the security of data, we must adopt the loseless compression which wipes off the redundancy information and doesn?t influence the information entropy, at the same time ,the compressed  information can be recovered. The target is to wipe off the maximum of removing redundancy information[9]. There are many data compression algorithm. In RFID Middleware software, on account of efficiency( both space and time), there is a need to keep the data in compressed form for as much as possible, even when it is being searched. So we selected the Lzw compression algorithm. A string table must be built to store the data. If the other data matches the data stored string table, the index of string table can be output. Because of the index bytes less than the bytes of fact data that increases the compression rate. The string table needn?t transport with the data and is dynamic generation.

[10]  The compression algorithm can be described as follows:  step1 initialization build a string table step2  read the first input char set the prefix    string f; step3   read the next char if( no char) output f char, exit if(fx exist in string table)  fx=f repeat Step3; Else  if(fx not exist in string table) output f char fx can be added to S (string table)  x= f repeat Step3 LZW compression algorithm data flow can be described  as follows  Fig.6  LZW compression algorithm data flow  V THE PERFORMANCE TEST OF RFID MIDDLEWARE     After we finished the RFID Middleware software, we built a simple testing environment:  The hardware environment as follows: TABLE I  THE HARDWARE ENVIRONMENT  RFID device  IF4 and IF5 of internec XCRF-500 of Yuanwanggu  host CPU>=1.0G memory>=256M hard disk>=20G  os Windows XP Professional Net  10\100M  application WMS  The WMS using the DLL of RFID Middleware had finished the input and output of whole pallet and the testing performance has:  The Stability testing of system The control test of system  ) The reading and accurate rate of RFID tag ) The security testing of RFID tag )The data compression testing.

The result of testing ) Run two hours, the system worked properly and  use few CPU and memory./ ) The number of input and output whole pallet is 50.

The reading accurate rate is 100% and this system can update the right data.

) The data compression function is proper.



VI. CONCLUSION  RFID is the hottest spot of current research. It can be used in wide area, including logistics, guard system, ticket management, airline express, mobile business, automatization etc. Many industries are absorbed in the RFID product and application, the RFID Middleware becomes very important. But the data security and compression is a problem. This paper used two two-double method to protect the data in tag-labels.

One is the verification of the reader and the other is data encryption. Because of the capacity of tag, this paper  used two-step encryption and improved the data security. We proposed the method of data compression for some special areas. We can use tag?s memory more sufficient and save the cost for applications.
