Visual Analytics in Augmented Reality Neven A. M. ElSayed

ABSTRACT In the last decade, Augmented Reality has become more mature and is widely adopted on mobile devices. Exploring the available infor- mation of a user?s environment is one of the key applications. How- ever, current mobile Augmented Reality interfaces are very limited compared to the recently emerging big data exploration tools for desktop computers. Our vision is to bring powerful Visual Analytic tools to mobile Augmented Reality.

Challenges for this approach include: limited input capabilities of mobile platforms, limited display capabilities (resolution, field of  ?e-mail: neven.elsayed@mymail.unisa.edu.au ?e-mail: chris.sandor@gmail.com ?e-mail: Hamid.Laga@unisa.edu.au  view), and the dynamically changing environment the user is in. To solve these problems, we propose to create mobile Augmented Re- ality visualization techniques based on Visual Analytics tools. We will demonstrate these techniques in a food shopping assistant. The assistant can show the containment relations of ingredients between different products.

We are currently working on the visualization design; next, we will implement a prototype and evaluate different alternative visu- alizations. Our research will impact the Augmented Reality com- munity, as well as the Visual Analytics community.

During the last decade the interest in location-based and context-based applications increased [16, 11, 6, 2, 3, 5, 18, 7, 15]. The context-based visualization research area experienced a huge interest due to the rapid growth of the amount of information. Visual Analytics (VA) is one of the main tools used to solve the information overload problem. Our vision is to create mobile AR visualization techniques based on VA tools to increase the effectiveness of the presented information.

AR applications are used to enhance the real scene with com- puter generated information. Visualization is one of the main parts of AR applications for the visual interaction with user. According to [8] visualization research areas can be classified into three main- types: data integration, scene manipulation, and context driven vi- sualization. Data integrationis the process of integrating properly virtual objects into real scenes. Scene manipulation works on ways for increasing the virtual information content. Context driven visu- alization focuses on merging the virtual information according to the physical context. Mobile AR context driven visualization ex- pands the interaction features, which triggered extra challenges on this specific type (such as limited input capabilities, limited display capabilities, and thedynamic change in the user?s surrounding en- vironment). In this research we propose an approach to solve these mentioned problems.
