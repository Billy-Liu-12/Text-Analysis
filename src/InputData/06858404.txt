ReRAM-based 4T2R Nonvolatile TCAM with 7x NVM-Stress Reduction, and 4x  Improvement in Speed-WordLength-Capacity for Normally-Off Instant-On

Abstract This study proposes an RC-filtered stress-decoupled  (RCSD) 4T2R nonvolatile TCAM (nvTCAM) to 1) suppress match-line (ML) leakage current from match cells (IML-M), 2) reduce ML parasitic load (CML), 3) decouple NVM-stress from wordlength (WDL) and IML-MIS. RCSD reduces NVM-stress by 7+x, and achieves a 4+x improvement in speed-WDL-capacity-product. A 128x32b RCSD nvTCAM macro was fabricated using HfO ReRAM and an 180nm CMOS. This paper presents the first ReRAM-based nvTCAM featuring the shortest (1.2ns) search delay (TSD) among nvTCAMs with WDL?32b.

Introduction Search engines (SEs) for big-data processing (Fig. 1), such  as anti-virus scanners for downloads on smart mobile devices or pattern recognition for a wireless sensor networks (WSNs), use ternary content-addressable-memory (TCAM) [1] as a filter to reduce the amount of data sent to the following stage to lower dynamic power, while employ a nonvolatile memory (NVM) for pattern storage during power off/interrupt to reduce standby power. However, this 2-macro scheme suffers long delays and large energy for wake-up operations [2] due to word-by-word serial transfer of data between TCAM and NVM macros. Fig. 2 compares the energy of a SE in a WSN.

To achieve small area and fast/low-power wake-up operations, nvTCAM have been designed: diode-based 4T/6T2R (D4T/6T2R) MTJ [3-4] and phase change memory (PCM) 2T2R [5]. Preventing read-disturbance and degraded reliability requires that stress (voltage/current/time) on NVMs (MTJ/ReRAM) be limited. Previous nvTCAMs suffered: (1) High NVM-stress at long WDL; (2) Tradeoff between macro area (A) and WDL against IML-M and NVM-stress-limited ML mismatch current (IML-MIS); (3) Long TSD due to large CML. To overcome (1)~(3), this study proposes an RCSD 4T2R nvTCAM using Resistive RAM (ReRAM) [6], which has low write energy, logic-process compatibility, and high resistance (R)-ratio between high-R (HRS) and low-R (LRS) states.

RC-Filtered Stress-Decoupled (RCSD) 4T2R nvTCAM Fig. 3 shows the circuit of a RCSD cell, comprising 2  NVMs/ReRAM (RT/RB), 2 comparison transistors (NC/NCB), a write-control transistor (NWC), and an ML-driver transistor (NML). The gate and source of NC/NCB are connected to data-lines (DL/DLB) and a dynamic source line (DSL), respectively. The gate and drain of NWC are connected to the wordline (WL) and write-voltage-control (VWC), respectively.

The employed ReRAM is capable of two overwrite operations: SET and RESET, which alter the ReRAM from HRS to LRS and LRS to HRS, respectively. In standby mode, the ML is maintained at a precharge voltage (VPRE), while WL=VWC=DSL=0. For write-1 operations (Fig. 4) in Phase 1,  RB is SET (DL=0, DLB=1) to LRS by applying VWL-SET to WL, VSET to VWC, and 0V to DSL. In Phase 2, RT is then RESET (DL=1, DLB=0) to HRS by applying VWL-RESET to WL, 0V to VWC, and VRESET to DSL.

In search operation (Fig.5), unlike previous nvTCAMs with NVMs placed on the IML path for the direct control of ML voltage (VML), our RCSD decouples the NVM from IML path using NML controlled by an RC-filtered pulse. In a search-1 operation (DL=1 and DLB=0), a DSL pulse (voltage-swing=VDSL, and pulse-width=TDSL) is passed to node NX through NC and RT. If RT is LRS (mismatch), due to a short RC delay (TRC), VNX-LRS will exceed the threshold voltage of NML (VTH-NML) for period TNX-LRS, enabling NML to generate large IML-MIS to pull down VML. If RT is HRS (match), a long TRC, short pulse-width (TNX-HRS) and low peak voltage (VNX-HRS) are generated at node NX. Because VNX-HRS is below VTH-NML, NML is cut-off with ultra-small mean IML-M (~0, <<IML-MIS), such that VML is kept near VPRE. If both RT and RB are HRS (don?t care) or masked inputs (DL=DLB=0), RCSD will behave the same as the match case. After period ML developing time (TML), which is controlled by a self-timed scheme, the sense amplifier (SA) is turned on (SAEN=1) to detect the VML and generate a digital output (MLO).

Performance and Measured Results 2T2R cells have a small cell area but suffer small difference  in VML (?VML=?IML*TML) between cases of match and worst-case mismatch (1 bit mismatch, k-1 bits masked), because IML-M >0 when R-ratio<100, producing slow TSD/TML and short WDL, which necessitates the use of 2-bit encoding [5]. D4T/6T2R cells stack a NMOS-diode (VD1) and IR-drop/voltage-stress on NVM (VR) to generate VML (=VD1+VR). Thus, nvTCAMs suffer long NVM stress time (TR) when WDL is long due to TR=TML. In contrast, TR (=TRC) in RCSD remains constant across various WDLs, enabling RCSD to achieve TR 7+x shorter than previous nvTCAMs for long WDL(>64), as Fig. 6 shows. Because IML-M~=0, the large ?IML enables RCSD to achieve WDL 16x/4x longer than 2T2R (w/ 2b-encoding) at R-ratio=10/100. RCSD achieves CML 2.3x/1.7x smaller than that of 2T2R/D4T2R cells because one terminal of an NMOS is connected to ML. With smaller CML and larger ?IML, the RCSD achieves TSD 2~7x (Fig. 7) shorter than previous nvTCAMs across a range of WDLs for a given ?VML. Thanks to NMOS-only and long WDL capability, for a 64Kb 128b-WDL nvTCAM with min. R-ratio=10, RCSD can achieve a macro area 2.2x and 1.2x smaller than that of 2T2R (requiring multiple banks) and D4T2R, respectively. RCSD improves the [WDL*(1/ TSD)*(1/A)] by 4+x times, compared to previous nvTCAMs using the same technology and ReRAM.
