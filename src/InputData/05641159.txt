Estimating and Improving the Probability of

Abstract-Software project management is the art and  science of planning and leading software projects, It is a sub  discipline of project management in which software projects are  planned. monitored and controlled To ensure that a certain  software project is successful is the main responsibility of the  project manager, From the point of view of a project manager. a  success is defined as: Did the system come in "up to  specifications", in time and on budget? Many factors come into  play in deciding the success of the project such as project  management, customer involvement etc,  In this paper, online survey is used to collect project data  about a number o/factors upon which the outcome of the project  depends, Data mining tools such as Association Rule Mining,  Naive Bayes, Decision Tree and Neural networks are used to  determine whether a project will be successful or not, In  addition to that, it also ,finds out the most important factors  guiding the project to success and determine the changes  required to turn an unsuccessful project into a successful one,  Index Terms-data mining, software project management,  factor  1. INTRODUCTION  Every software project suffers with risk of failure.

The reason of failure can be anything from lack of budget  or poor management to customer involvement or even  absence of sponsor. According to The Standish Group's  report, "CHAOS Summary 2009"[1], There has been a  marked decrease in project success rates, with 32% of all  projects succeeding which are delivered on time, on  budget, with required features and functions, 44% were  challenged which are late, over budget, and/or with less  than the required features and functions and 24% failed  which are cancelled prior to completion or delivered and  never used(Fig. 1).

Therefore it is imperative to investigate those factors on  which success of a project depends and thus predict  whether a project will be a success or not.

A variety of factors have been identified that are critical  to the success of a software project[2]. Some of them are  management, budget, customer involvement, deadline etc.

Software Project success rates in years 2004, 2006 and 2009 (A  report by The Standish Group),  In the paper, data collected by online surveys with  questionnaires are used to analyse the success and failure  factors and also determine whether the project will be a  success or not.

Data Mining is defined as extracting or mining  knowledge from large amounts of data. It is used to  determine characteristics of association, classification,  clustering, prediction and estimation within data sets.

In this paper data mining algorithms are used to predict  the success of a software project and identify the factors  which lead to project success or failure. These algorithms  are applied on data collected by online survey website.

2. PROPOSED ANALYSIS METHOD  As shown in the Fig. 2 create a survey web site that  enables users to fill a simplified form of the questionnaire  defined in Appendix A. The simplified form consist of a  set of questions that consider all the actors which play a  part in the Project Development Cycle: (1) Customers, (2)  Managers, (3) Users and (4) Developers. It also contains  an important Question - whether their project was  successful or not. Every answer to the questions in the  survey will belong to one of these sets of answers - (yes,  no, can't say) or (high, medium, low) and this data would  be stored in a Database [3]. Once this sample data is    collected, use it as training data to form Mining Models  using Data Mining algorithms such as ID3 Algorithm,  Association Rule, Naive Bayes and Neural Network and  store these in the Database. Now, when a person wants to  know whether his/her project will be successful or not  then he will answer the same questions asked in the  survey with the exception of the last question(was your  project successful ?),thus forming our query data. This  query would be analyzed with each of the Mining Models  so as to evaluate whether the project would be successful  or not and if not, then what changes to make so as to tum  it into a successful one.

Prediction  & Analysis  Fig. 2. A flow diagram showing the steps of the proposed solution  3. IMPLEMENTATION OF ALGORITHMS  Data will be analysed using four different data mining  algorithms. The implementation of the algorithms have  been explained under the headings Naive Bayes, Neural  Networks, ID3 and Apriori.

A. Naive Bayes  Naive Bayes algorithm works with building mmmg  models which are used for both classification and  prediction. It calculates probabilities for each possible  value of the input attributes, provided that the value of the  output attribute is given; this can be used later to predict  an outcome of the output attribute based on the known  input attributes. The algorithm supports only discrete  attributes, and it considers all input attributes to be  independent [4].

In this paper, data acquired from the survey website  (set of values of both input and output attributes) is used  to calculate the probabilities of the occurrence of each  value of input attribute in view of the output value i.e. the  attribute that predicts whether the project is going to be a  success or not. Since there are no such questions in the  survey whose answer is going to be continuous valued (i.e.

values are 1, 2 or 3 for 'yes', 'no' and 'can't say',  respectively), hence we are effectively dealing with   discrete values for the input as well as output attributes.

Besides all the attributes are independent to each other    which makes Naive Bayes an excellent algorithm for  prediction in this case.

In the second part, the user fills out the query form  (which is used for the prediction). This supplies the input  attributes from which the output attribute (success or  failure) is determined.

B. Neural Network  The neural network algorithm creates classification  mining models by constructing a multilayer perceptron  network of neurons. The algorithm processes the entire set  of cases, iteratively comparing the predicted classification  of the cases with the known actual classification of the  cases. The errors from the initial classification of the first  iteration of the entire set of cases is fed back into the  network, and used to modify the network's model for the  next iteration, and so on till the error vanish to a very  small value[ 4].

In this paper, the input layer of the perceptron network  consists of the input attributes along with some hidden  layers and an output layer with one node which stores the  predicted output(Fig. 2). The number of input layer nodes  is same as the number of input attributes determined from  the survey as each node corresponds to a question asked in  the survey. The entire set of the survey data is processed  and compared to actual output data. The errors are then  back-propagated into the network and the network model  is modified accordingly.

Fig. 3. Neural Network  Now, when the network model has been created with  the minimal possible error, the query data is processed  through the network and the output is determined on the  fact whether the output value (which will be a floating  point value) is closer to 1 (a success) or 0 (failure). For  example a value like 0.99216 denotes a success whereas  0.00112 is a failure.

C. Decision Tree Algorithm  The Decision Tree algorithm is implemented m two  steps:  1. Identification of Factors (Mining Model)  2. Prediction and Analysis    1) Identification of Factors: Decision tree algorithm  builds mining models (Decision Tree) that can be used for  classification and prediction [4]. For building this model  the dataset needs to be analysed, in order to determine  which input attributes play the major role in determining  the success or failure of a Project, then these selected  attributes are used to form a Decision Tree depending  upon their Information Gain, greater the Information Gain  greater will be its role in predicting the output attribute.

In our case we have considered each question of the  survey to be an input attribute, while success or failure is  the output attribute.

Fig. 3 shows an example of a Decision Tree formed  after Mining the Dataset obtained from the survey. From  the figure it's clear that out of n attributes (corresponding  to n questions in the survey) only 5 attributes determine  the success or failure of the project, as far as our Dataset  is concerned.

Fig. 4. Example of Decision Tree  2) Prediction and Analysis: The model shown in Fig. 4 is  used to predict the outcome of a project. Consider a case  where the query data is such that the prediction comes out  to be 'Failure', i.e. Q20=No, Q16=No, Q7=No. Now in  order to make this Project a success, the minimum number  of changes that have to be made are: Q16=Yes, Q7=Yes.

A simple procedure that is followed to determine this is:  Backtrack from the 'Failure' node and find the common  ancestor between the closest 'Success' node. Now, trace  the path from the common ancestor to this 'Success' node,  the node label and its edges will yield the required result.

D. Association Rule Mining  In the case of Association Rule Mining, a two step  procedure is followed:  1. Identification of Rules  2. Prediction and Analysis  1) Identification of Rules: Association Rule Mining is a  method for discovering interesting relations between  variables in large databases [4], [7]. The algorithm works  as follows: it considers each attribute/value pair (such as  Q11yes =1,Q1Ino = 2,Q1/can't say = 3,Q2lyes = 4 & so  on) as an item. An item set is a combination of items in a    single transaction. The algorithm scans through the dataset  trying to find item sets that tend to appear in many  transactions. A minimum support & confidence threshold  is also fixed, below which no item set is accepted. Once  all possible combinations of item sets of varying sizes are  found arrange them in descending order of their  confidence. These item sets form the Rules following  which the success or failure of a project is determined.

One thing of importance that needs to be noted is that  each item in the rule is a factor on which the result  depends.

2) Prediction & Analysis: The above Rules(Mining Model)  are now used to analyze a new Project(query data) and to  predict it's probability of success. Considering Fig. 5  (Example of a set of Rules) analyzing is started from the  first Rule and continued downwards until the query data  matches one of the rules, then the corresponding  confidence level is our probability of success for that  particular project. Now coming to more important part,  what changes to make so that our probability of success  increases? The solution is simple - all the Rules above the  one which matched have a higher confidence level, i.e.

higher probability of success, hence if those particular  items are included in our new item set then the probability  of success is bound to increase.

CONCLUSION  This paper proposes a method that demonstrates the  power of using a data mining approach in order to indicate  the most important factors that lead to software  development project success. Besides this it is also  successful in suggesting ways of not only improving the  probability of success but also to tum a project which was  going to fail into a successful one.

In the future additional measurements of the Software  Development Cycle viz. Requirement, Design,    Implementation, Verification, Maintenance, could be  added to the survey and identify which one of them is  more important to have a successful project. The work  could be further extended by showing which factors are  global and which are culture specific.
