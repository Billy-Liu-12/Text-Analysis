Detection of Intrusion Using Evolutionary  Soft Computing Techniques

Abstract- An intrusion detection system has the ability to detect  known as well as unknown attacks. Conventionally, IDS uses  association rules and simple partitioning scheme to handle  quantitative data. Fuzzy partitioning scheme found to overcome  the problem of vagueness of boundary and association rules are  also replaced with fuzzy class association rules. Evolutionary  algorithms do global search in order to discover new interesting  classification rules. GNP is found better than other evolutionary  algorithms due to its structure. This paper describes how  evolutionary computing technologies are better to build a  classifier with minimum number of class association rules and  maximizing accuracy of classified patterns in intrusion detection  problem.

Key words - Data Mining, Evolutionary Computation, Fuzzy Classification rules, and IDS.



I. INTRODUCTlON  An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is mandatory for sustaining safe surfing and preventing cybercrimes as a result of multiplication of new threats and frauds regularly. Any set of activities that challenges availability, confidentiality and integrity of system are termed as intrusion [1]. For this purpose, most of the systems demanding prominent level of security merged IDS with present scenario formed using existing security mechanisms such as data encryption, authentication schemes and firewall [2]. Generally, there are two models to detect intrusion: misuse detection and anomaly detection.

IDS can be classified as Host based Intrusion Detection system and Network Based Intrusion detection system. Host based IDS rely upon records provided by host operating system [3] and therefore may protect only single host. While Network based IDS uses networking tools to collect traffic and protect all host on the network. It may also use audit logs provided by multiple host's operating systems [4]. Most of IDS uses one of the two methods to find intrusion: Misuse Detection, Anomaly Detection. Misuse Detection system checks discovered patterns against known attack's signatures. So, it is also known as signature detection system [5]. While Anomaly detection system searches for unusual behavior that appears far from normal scenario learned through training. It may alarm unidentified attacks but requires long training period [4]. A hybrid approach combines these two to seize their advantages and is significantly better.

Generally, audits logs track both normal and intrusive activities are utilized by IDS for learning and detection   purpose. Intelligent data mmmg refers to the process of extracting useful information from excessive amount of data [6]. Many data mining algorithms such as Classification, Association Rule Mining, Clustering, Frequency Episodes etc.

[5] have been utilized in intrusion detection field.

Data Mining techniques such as Association Rule Mining and Frequency Episodes can be used to get interdependency among patterns in database [7, 8]. Discovered dependencies are conveyed in form of rules, known as association rules. The left part comprises observed fields and right part includes prediction with measurements. The main motivation behind Association rules is Market Basket Analysis which aims to discover patterns illustrating customer behavior [9]. Shimada, Hirasawa and Hu (2007) stated that "Association rules are widely used in marketing, decision making and business management" [10]. Consider the following rule: "if a customer buys a smart phone then he may also buy headphone".

Association rule would be.

(Smart phone q Headphone) [sup. =0.65%, conf. = 0.76%]  Apriori algorithm [11] is well recognized for association rule mining. This algorithm outputs association rules based on user defined threshold for two measures: support and confidence. But the algorithm uses only binary attributes and produce overhead while dealing with dense database [12, 13].

Classification is also a data mining technique which builds up the model through learning and then uses it to predict label of unknown data [14]. A Class Association rule is similar to IF? THEN rule and differs significantly from association rule. The difference lies in consequent part. The consequent part of association rules may contain one or more items while class association rules contain only single item i.e. class label.

According to Mabu et aI., an Intrusion detection problem is similar to building a classifier which aims to classify test record into one of the two categories: normal and intrusive [12]. The output of classifier depends upon number of classification rules. A larger rule set will definitely produce more accurate result and also raises overhead of processing these rules [15].

In order to discover interesting rules from dense database, Genetic Network Programming has been used in conjunction with association rule mining [12]. The advantage of using evolutionary mechanisms in data mining is ability to do global search to mine more interesting rules to discover intrusion [9].Genetic Network Programming is one step ahead of past     evolutionary strategies such as Genetic Algorithm, Evolutionary Programming due to graph representation. Other features of GNP include ability to represent processing delay and recall past actions [7, 16]. All evolutionary techniques use different representation to visualize individuals.

II. RELATED WORK.

Denning proposed a real time Intrusion Detection Model (1987) that is independent of any computing environment and application [17]. The model recommends profiles to express normal behavior and uses rules to update profiles and check for security violations. Profiles were prepared with respect of components such as subject, object and actions using statistical approaches. The main components of the model are subjects, objects, and profiles, anomaly records, audit records and rules.

Agrawal and Srikant proposed Apriori algorithm to mine associations between items in database [11]. Association rule mining outputs a set of rules to train classifier for intrusion detection. Support and confidence dominate in the evaluation of association rules. The Algorithm performs well for binary attributes instead of quantitative attributes. But real world database contains binary, discrete, numerical and continuous attributes. So, they proposed another approach for dealing with Quantitative association rules [18].

Lee and Stolfo (1998) proposed a framework that integrates classification and rule mining algorithms to construct models for intrusion detection that is widely applicable to many platforms [2]. Data mining approaches (Association rules and Frequency episodes) are used to find out right subset of features as accuracy of classifier greatly depends upon availability of fine training scripts and features used to characterize the model.

Idris and Shanmugam presented a model using fuzzy logic and Data mining to reach goals of intrusion detection system [4]. They used SNORT to monitor and synthesize network traffic and Mandami inference approach. A variation of Kuok's algorithm was used to output rules meeting user specified constraints. The main attraction of the model is Tracer phase which attempts to discover root terminal from which attack has been launched, to redirect all subsequent attacks back to the root.

Hoque, Mukit, and Bikas described Genetic algorithm based intrusion detection system that works in two phases: pre? calculation phase and detection phase [3]. The pre-calculation phase outputs a set of chromosomes constituting initial population. In the second phase, Chromosomes are tested for fitness and best chromosomes are further evolved using genetic operators such as crossover and mutation to produce new population and tested again. The loop terminates when specified no. of generations was reached.

Wang Yunwu combined fuzzy Expert system and Genetic algorithm approach to detect intrusion [19]. The Expert system used Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) algorithm to fuzzify input values, Mamdani's minimum fuzzy implication rule for approximate reasoning and weighted average method to defuzzify linguistic terms. Fuzzy algorithm was employed to develop a rough membership function which will further be optimized using Genetic Algorithm exercising Roulette Wheel selection   scheme. Experimental results are given to prove effectiveness of GA.

Lu and Traore used Genetic Programming to evolve new rules in order to discover known as well as unknown attacks.

Support and confidence were used to measure fitness of individuals [20].

R. Shanmugavadivu and Dr.N.Nagarajan described fuzzy network anomaly detection system that works as follows [ 21, 22]: Firstly, System is trained using data sets classified into normal as well as attack specific to prepare profiles using statistical models and measures. Rules were generated by discovering frequents items to select significant features and subsequently filtered to get definite rules (class association rules). Further definite rules will be converted into fuzzy definite rules and stored in rule base to be used in detection phase.

Kuok, Fu and Wong introduced fuzzy association rules to mine quantitative attributes. The Significance and Certainty factors are the two measures to extract important fuzzy rules.

Rules satisfying user threshold will be selected as important [23, 24].

Kaoru Shimada, Kotaro Hirasawa and linglu Hu described rule acquisition mechanism from incomplete database using GNP. It is extension of conventional GNP in that transition moves to no side in case of missing data. In addition, measurements were calculated differently from conventional GNP [10].

Taboada et al. discussed self -adaptive mechanism with regard to genetic network programming for evolving new interesting rules and cutting down no. of generations [25]. Self? adapt ion means control parameters such as crossover rate, mutation rate, and population size are settled adaptively by itself (algorithm). The performance of genetic algorithms depends on these strategy parameters. P. 1. Angeline states that "the idea of self -adaption is to incorporate control parameter into GNP individual and evolve them during each generation similar to GNP individuals" [26].

Most of the existing intrusion detection systems lack resource awareness, low false alarm rate and reliability [3].

Most of the intrusion detection system relies on expert's knowledge. To reduce this dependence, various data mining and artificial learning methods have been applied [2, 21]. The main reason behind complexity of IDS is unpredictable behavior patterns [21]. In order to handle this uncertainty, fuzzy sets are important tool.



III. EVOLUTIONARY TECHNIQUES USED FOR IDS  A. Genetic Network Programming  Genetic evolutionary mechanisms are encouraged by Darwin's theory of survival of fittest [3]. Although GA, GP and GNP are much similar in terms of evolution process, genetic operators but difference lies in representation of solution [9].

There are so many evolutionary algorithms like PDAO and EP which represent combination of genes using network.

NTi   o  o  D  Processing Node  Judgment Node  : Start Node  Fig. I: GNP Structure. [7, 13, 14]  IDi Cil Ci2 Ci3  0 1 1 2 2 3 5 3 6 4 2 5 7 5 6 6 8 7 8 8 5 9 9 6  EP (Evolutionary programming) use finite automata in which all possible states are defined in advance. But it suits to deal with few defmed states and raise complexity upon massive input. Parallel Algorithm Discovery and Orchestration (PADO) is also a directed graph having special nodes where each node can have mUltiple outgoing edges limited by total number of nodes. But it halts after some time and returns to start node.

Therefore, it was designed to construct static system. On the other hand, GNP can be used to deal with highly complex and dynamic system [16].

In fig. 1, there are three types of nodes in Genetic Network Programming: Start node, Processing node, Judgment node [7, 13, 14] and each node type (NTi) is numbered as 0, 1 and 2 respectively. IDi indicates a number to uniquely identify each node in GNP structure. CiJ, Ci2, Ci3 are nodes reachable from nodei [16]. Judgment nodes J, - - - - - - - Jn are conditional nodes while Processing node P, - - - - - - - - - - Pn are straight forward. GNP execution is guided by outcome of Judgment node and action is represented using Processing node. The role of start node is similar to start pointer in linked list and next node is determined according to connection of currently processed node and outcome of judgment node [35].

B.Fuzzy Logic  The Fuzzy logic techniques have been introduced in the field of cyber security since early 90' [4, 5]. Traditionally, fuzzy systems use fuzzy if -then rules constructed using expert's assistance. This process is longer and less reliable.

Therefore, many learning methods have been used to automate rule generation process [27, 28].

The motivation behind introduction of fuzzy sets to intrusion detection problem is to deal with quantitative features   and blurred boundaries between normal and abnormal data [29]. Fuzzy logic provides flexibility to care uncertainty and vagueness of complex problems.

The fuzzy approach for handling continuous data is as follows [9]: Fuzzy sets will be defined for all continuous attributes and visualized using membership functions. The membership functions such as Triangular, Trapezoidal and Gaussian could be used either separately or jointly. In addition, it is challenging to define an appropriate membership function by itself, so, it is chosen experimentally [30] using nonuniform mutation to mine as many as new interesting rules. Once appropriate membership function is obtained, membership values of each continuous attributes are calculated to be examined at judgment node.

Consider the sample database shown in table 1. Fig. 2 and 3 refers to their corresponding membership function. Table-2 corresponds to their fuzzy membership values.

A.GNP Based Class Association Rules  Class association rules follow the following syntax [13, 31]:  (AI=I) AND (A2=1) AND ---- AND (An=l) q (C=m)  Where A I to An are binary attributes belonging to database and C denotes a set of class labels.

Concluding right set of rules to alarm abnormal activities is a significant challenge in rule based intrusion detection system.

Brin et al. made the suggestion to measure the significance of association rules by using Chi Squared Test [7]. A larger rule set will definitely produce more accurate result and also raises overhead of processing these rules [15]. Shimada, Hirasawa and Hu (2006) stated "GNP is proposed to store new interesting rules in pool instead of getting individual with higher fitness value" [13]. Node chaining is used to represent rules. Connection of Judgment node to another node of same type indicates yes while connection to next processing node indicates no in GNP structure. Figure 4 shows the structure of GNP for class association rule mining. Attributes in training database act as judgment nodes. Types of judgment node equals to number of attributes in database [8]. GNP executes as follows for deducing class association rules [13]: GNP always starts from first processing node for each tuple in database.

After reading the tuple, first attribute value will be checked at judgment node JI. If it matches, then it moves to next judgment node J2. Otherwise, transition will be forwarded to next processing node in order. The above procedure will be repeated for each tuple in database. Table 4 represents sample database.

In table 4, consider TID 2, it does not satisfy (W=I), so, processing node P2 will be picked followed by PI in fig4.

Again, consider TID 3, it satisfies judgment nodes (W=I), (X=I) and (Y=I) and fails at judgment node (Z=I), then node P3 will be selected as outcome of conditional node J4 in fig4.

In the same way, all tuples belonging to database will be traversed. Measurements are calculated upon completion. For example, consider the rule: (W=I) ... (X=I), the support for this rule will be (2/3) and confidence for this rule will be (2/2) [13].

TABLE 4  TID W X Y Z 1 1 1 0 1 2 0 1 1 0 3 1 1 1 0  P,  Fig4: Connection of nodes in GNP for Association Rule Mining Ref. [13] .

TABLE 3, RE F. [13]  Association Rule Support Confidence (W=I) ... (X=I) a2/N a2 1 al  (X=I) ... (Y=I) && (Z=I) a4/N a4 1 a2 (W=1 ).. (X=I) && (Y=l) a3/N a3 1 al (W=I) && (X=I)" (Y=I) a3/N a3 1 a2 (X=I) && (Y=I) ... (Z=I) a41 N a4 1 a3  Conditions of selecting important rules are defined by user.

Shimada, Hirasawa and Hu (2006) stated that "The extracted rules can be used for classification directly if they pass the criteria" [13]. Evolved rules will be stored for classification.

Table 3 denotes some of extracted association rules.

B. GNP Based Fuzzy Classification Rules  Taboada et al. extended his previous work [32] by integrating Fuzzy Logic with conventional Association Rule Mining based on GNP [7]. Membership values will be calculated for each quantitative attribute. GNP transitions are determined by comparing a random number (between 0 and 1) with membership values of continuous attribute Ai. No-side will be reached if membership value has lesser magnitude than random number otherwise yes-side will be selected.

"Ishibuchi et al. have proposed a fuzzy classification rule's algorithm whose main thing is to employ multiple fuzzy partitions in single fuzzy system" [14]. This algorithm generates excessive fuzzy rules and therefore evolutionary algorithms were used to select a small subset of important fuzzy association rules.

All fuzzy classification rules follow the following syntax [9, 33]:  IF (AI is low) AND (A2 is Medium) AND ------- AND (An is High) THEN Intrusion.

Where Low, Medium and high are linguistic terms denoting fuzzy sets.

Karla Taboada et al. have proposed a classification model based on GNP [9]. Firstly it extracts sufficient fuzzy classification rules taking GNP structure in consideration and then models a classification model that utilizes previously discovered rules. To find out more rules, fuzzy membership function was chosen experimentally. Ci Chen, et al. have shown experimentally that nonuniformly mutated fuzzy membership function provides high detection rate and low false alarm rate than fixed membership function and uniformly mutated fuzzy membership function [30].

GNP structure for fuzzy classification rule mining is shown in Fig.5.

P, S : Service o : Du ration P: Protocol  ---+ No  Fig. 5: Node connections for Fuzzy Rule Mining Ref. [12].

In Fig. 5, Judgment nodes represents attributes of training database such as service, duration, land etc. For any continuous attribute Ai, GNP transition is influenced by fuzzy membership value. This approach is also known as Hybrid Rule mining.

As in fig. 5, GNP always commence from first processing node for eliciting new rules. PI is connected to judgment node Ji> which is connected to another judgment node J2. Yes side of judgment node J2 is connected to another judgment node J3 and no side is connected to next processing node P2? Same judgment nodes can also be used in other classification rules without any repetition in GNP structure.

Rules are derived as follows [9, 31, 33]: Attribute value is examined at conditional node Ji to determine transition from current node to another node. With every yes, counter on that node will be incremented by one and for no, next Processing node Pi will be reached. Yes side of judgment nodes proceeds until "no" is returned by any judgment node on the move or rule's length goes beyond the maximum bound. In this way, all tuples will be inspected one by one. Confidence, X2 and support are three measurements which are required to be calculated at every processing node using counters at each yes and no side.

In Fig.5, value of N equals to the total number of tuples in training database and ai> bi> Ci> d, are measures to know how many tuples moving to yes side.

All important rules along with measurements calculated using GNP structure will be stored in the pool. Stored rules can further be revised upon duplication by sustaining higher X2 value along with matching membership parameters. In this way, pool comprising only important rules is updated in every generation [14, 12]. Main attractions of above method are simplified calculation of measurements and flexible criteria of extracting important association rules [13, 14]. Therefore, rules satisfying user defined threshold for above measures will be retained in pool and rest are dismissed.

The initial population is generated by random connections between judgment and processing nodes. Initial population of individuals may not constitute all functions [9].

But total no. of nodes is same for all GNP individual in each generation. GNP individuals are evaluated using following fitness function: [9, 10, 14, 33].

Where: X: set of suffix satisfying criteria defined by user,  (x): Chi squared value of rule x, a (x) : number of variables in antecedent part for rule x,  r new (x) : additional constant defined by [12, 13, 31]  (1)  t'I'llIl'Ol" C ) = { TnOl"W (Rule x is new) (same rule exists in pool) (2)  D. GNP Evolution  GNP individuals could be evolved to get new rules until specified no. of generations has been reached. GNP evolution comprises following operators [12, 14]: selection, crossover and mutation. The selection operator only selects individuals with higher fitness value instead of reproducing individuals.

GNP individuals are ordered downwardly according to their fitness value and upper one third individuals are selected from list [9]. While crossover and mutation operators could mUltiply new individuals. New individuals are created by interchanging nodes along with genetic information using crossover rate Pc [7]. Node connections can also be changed randomly exploiting mutation rate Pm. The main purpose of evolution process is to accomplish global search in solution space. Parameters such as crossover and mutation rates are chosen experimentally [13].



V. CONCLUSION  Intrusion detection is a research area since many years.

Broadly, there are two techniques to detect intrusion: Misuse Detection, Anomaly detection. Most of the work has been done on misuse detection. It is much similar to antivirus systems in which a database containing known viruses and worms is prepared and updated regularly. Anomaly detection is detection of novel threats and can still be researched. Recent work in intrusion detection includes many data mining and evolutionary methods such as association rule mining, fuzzy logic, Genetic Algorithm, Genetic programming and Genetic Network Programming. Many models and framework has been proposed to exploit real time intrusion detection. In this paper, we described rule based intrusion detection system. Evolutionary algorithms are recommended to dig new interesting rules and evaluate them using pre-specified fitness function. Rules stored in pool are obtained by evolving initial population.
