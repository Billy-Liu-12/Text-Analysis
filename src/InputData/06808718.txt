The Green Cloud Effective Framework: An  Environment Friendly Approach Reducing CO2 Level  Samiran Royl, Somsubhra Gupta2  I, Department of Computer Science and Engineering  lIS College of Engineering Kalyani, India  1 samiranroy 12 3@gmail.com, 2 gsomsubhra@gmail.com  Abstraci-Cioud Computing is a computational framework  that provides collection of virtualized resources as Service. Cloud  computing is highly profitable cost effective services in the  business world in the present day scenario. However, the energy  consumption of Data Centers is the big problem emerging out of  growing demand for cloud services. That type of critical issues  not only reduces the profit margin, but also has effect on high carbon production which is a harmful for environment and living  organisms.

On the other hand, Green Computing is an overwhelming need  based environment friendly computational framework  empowered by low emission rate. The basic principles of Green computing is directed towards environment friendly  computation.

In this paper, a Green cloud enabled framework has been  proposed which envisioned the energy efficient way of a minimal discharge and rectification of the problem of high carbon  production so as to increase the profit margin. The profitability may not always be expressed with respect to revenue but in terms  of bio and environment friendliness. The target is to merge the  Cloud Service with the green cloud computational frame work for the future research.

I. INTRODUCTION  "Green Cloud Computing" gives the benefits to the environment. Cloud computing delivered as a service pay-per? use basis. In traditional approach in the business organization, the investment for the requirement of this type of Service and moving up for up-gradation without any hassle is achievable and affordable. The data repository is the main part for one of their service from the data centers. This data centers are incorporated as a component of Cloud services in and are  referred to as "Big Data".

As the computational intention has been gradually shifting to the Cloud Computational framework, the need for energy efficiency has been emerging as a core requirement for most hierarchical Organizations, not only to contain operating costs, but also to support growth (Corporation, 2010). Electricity costs are rising fast (Harris, 2011) [1]. For instance, according to an IBM estimate, the power demanded worldwide by data centres currently stands at 100 billion kWh a year, and data centres are one of the fastest-growing users of power (Pritchard, 2007) [2]. So potential market opportunity from a competitive viewpoint is a parallel in emergence of such   framework with on demand service. In this green cloud topology the organization reduces their power cost and increases their revenue.

Cloud and Environmental Statistic  According to Google's earnings reports, the company has spent US$1.9 billion on datacenters in 2006, and US$ 2.4 billion in 2007 [3] for the same purpose.



II. CLOUD SERVISES MODULE WITH GREEN COMPUTING  In the field of study of Cloud Computing which has entirely been Service based, it is always customary to identify the key definition in order to understand the computational framework and the approach of energy efficiency that has been tried to propose in the presented framework.

A National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) [4] defines Cloud computing as follows: "Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

This Cloud model promotes availability and is composed of five essential characteristics, three service models, and four deployment models. B. Buyya et al. [5] define the Cloud computing in terms of its utility to end user: "A Cloud is a market- oriented distributed computing system consisting of a collection of interconnected and virtualized computers that are dynamically provisioned and presented as one or more unified computing resource(s) based on service-level agreements established through negotiation between the service provider and consumers.". The three types of service module cloud  ICONCE 2014  January 16 - 17. 2014, Kalyani. WB. India.

computing Architecture is Software as a service (SaaS) it is a software delivery model as per user demands, Infrastructure? as-a-Service (IaaS) this service provide a virtual machines or physical machines, storage, and cluster type services and The last one is Platform as a Service (PaaS) contribution to their Cloud users a advancement platform to build their own applications. Microsoft Azure [6] Google App Engine [7], Aneka [8], and are some of the most prominent example of PaaS Clouds. It is mostly lower level of IaaS.

A. SaaS level:  SaaS mainly offer software installed on their own datacenters or resources from IaaS providers, In this service the service provider need to measure energy as per their requirement and not only that they also maintain replicas of user for maintain storage energy efficiency.

B. laaS level:  This is most important layer to perform in the success of whole green cloud architecture. In that level the service provider use the measuring service to calculate the power consumption level and not only that they also use the latest cooling system and that reason the carbon producing level control and save to our green cloud system.

C. PaaS level:  This can provide the platform development services and that facilitates the development of applications which ensures system wide energy efficiency. This can be done by inclusion of various energy profiling tools such as louie Sort [9].

As per virtualization and without virtualization research report, It is found that on-site server with no virtualization will emit about 46kg of CO2 per year. The figure will touch 2kg if a person using a public cloud conforming to best practices [10]. A new study by Microsoft, Accenture and WSP Environment & Energy reports that cloud computing reduces energy use and carbon emissions et al in [11]. The recent studies confirmed that rely on a server is generally more environmentally friendly, although care must be taken to a whole series of parameters to calculate the best real efficiency of the clouds. According to a new research from Pike Research [12], the global market for green data centers will grow from $17.1 billion in 2012 to $45.4 billion by 2016. In the other point of view the data centers producing heat in the real environment. It is also important to keep in mind that a data center has a more environmental impact than a system.



III. THE PROPOSED WORK  In this framework, the many stack of processor pull working over there as per requirement of user workload these can distribute as per their requirement. In this process, it also helps to reduce the emission rate and production of the carbon thus enabling to maintain the eco-friendliness of nature. The low carbon production allocation method many users to send their work load as per their requirement to the processor pool.

This processor pool have a many type of configuration layer like in one data process center have a P4 type of processor pool that is core i7 processor pool, core 2 Duo processor pool, Dual core processor pool and the last one is P4 processor pool.

Now the users request is first accepted by the repository server and here it can be divided as per the requirement processing technique like Hadoop et al in [13] or Hive use for data warehouse It is use for Map Reduce lobs within the Big Data platform.

Map Reduce  Map Reduce is a programming platform that can be sent to any one processor pool as per their workload volume, It is dedicated temporarily for some volume of user at the same time and volume consuming for their workload. Here one processor pool it similarly as one stack of service provider to produce their service after completion of the users work. It is time saving process and also helps to low carbon producing.

ensuring revenue margin to some high extent. It has been observed that the process is also effective for ensuring low CO2 emissions.



IV. GREEN COMPUTING GOALS  The Green Computing is identified the positive alternatively least negative relationship between the physical computer and its impact to the environments in which it moves through from cradle to grave presented with the following illustrations:  ? Full life-cycle analysis, not just the product on our desks  ? Manufacturing ? Use during lifetime ? Disposal and reallocation  The Green Computing task force identifies the to do list as the following terms of reference:  ? Identify green computing best practices ? Examine computing procurement guidelines ? Identify energy conservation strategies and practices ? Identify equipment disposal procedures  The prime reason behind emergence of Green computing are the following facts:  ? computer energy is often wasteful ? leaving the computer on when not in use (CPU and  fan consume power, screen savers consume power) ? printing is often wasteful  printing out partial drafts - for a "paperless" society, we tend to use more  paper today than before computer-prevalence ? toxicity  as we will see, there are toxic chemicals used in the manufacturing of computers and components which can enter the food chain and water!

? pollution manufacturing techniques  - packaging - disposal of computers and components  Following illustrations statistics may correlate the PC and energy requirement:  ? CPU uses 120 Watts ? CRT uses 150 Watts  8 hours of usage, 5 days a week = 562 kW if the computer is left on all the time without proper power saver modes, this can lead to 1,600 kW for a large institution, say a university of 40,000 students and faculty, the power bill for just computers can come to $2 million / year  ? Energy use comes from electrical current to run the CPU, motherboard, memory running the fan and spinning the disk(s) monitor (CRTs consume more power than any other computer component) printers
