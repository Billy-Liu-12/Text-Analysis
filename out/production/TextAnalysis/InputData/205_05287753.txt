I.  INTRODUCTION Along with the wide range of applications of the various  control systems and a variety of production operating management system which keep computer as the core, many enterprises and organizations have accumulated a large number of historical data related to industrial production process. However, the individual data is not useful information, and the rules among the data are helpful information for decision-making. For example, it is useful to raise questions, identify problems, analyze problems and solve the problem for decision-maker through describing the overall characteristic and forecasting the development trend of the data. Thus, it becomes more and more popular to research knowledge discovering and data mining in fluid industry?s database.

Cement industry is a typical high-resource, high- energy consumption flow industry, which is facing how to achieve sustainable development like other traditional industries.

Although great progress has been made in terms of technology and equipment of cement clinker in China, the overall level is still behind the world's advanced level, especially in terms of the energy-saving, environmental  protection and resource utilization. In recent years, a kind of new technology which is named new dry process decomposition outside of kiln appeared in modern cement production. Its technological core is suspension preheating and pre-decomposition technology. Decomposed furnaces constitute the pre-decomposition system whose performance can affect heat consumption, power consumption, environmental protection of burning system and performance of the whole system [1]. Temperature of decomposed furnaces is the fundamental condition to make decomposition rate of the raw in the furnaces reach 90%.

Keeping the temperature of decomposed furnaces? outlets is important to ensure high quality of products, running efficiency and reducing the maintenance costs. So it is very important to finding out the key factors which affect the temperature of decomposed furnaces? outlets and mining the potential rules.

Cement decomposing furnace is a considerable complex system, and it is difficult to describe the potential rules in general way. Some researchers have proposed a series of intelligent control methods which including fuzzy control were applied to data mining of fluid industry. The technology is lack of attribute reduction, but redundancy and uncertainty exist in this technology. The rough set theory can recognize potential dependent model from a large number of history data, while self-contained decision-making rules will be obtained [2]. Rough set (RS) theory [3], which is proposed by Polish mathematician Z. Pawlak in 1982, is a new mathematical tool dealing with the issue of vague and imprecise. Not only can the RS effectively analysis inaccurate, inconsistent and incomplete information, but also can do data analysis and reasoning, it discovers implied knowledge and reveals the potential rules. It has been successfully applied in the machine learning, knowledge discovery, expert system and areas of intelligent control.

This paper presents a kind of rules extraction method through analyzing industrial history data according relative importance of attributes. The new decision-making rules coincide with the human experience, so as to verify the   DOI 10.1109/ICICTA.2009.379    DOI 10.1109/ICICTA.2009.379    DOI 10.1109/ICICTA.2009.379    DOI 10.1109/ICICTA.2009.379    DOI 10.1109/ICICTA.2009.379    DOI 10.1109/ICICTA.2009.379    DOI 10.1109/ICICTA.2009.379     rationality of data mining with process industry data based on RS theory.



II. DATA MINING BASED ON ROUGH SET THEORY  A. Rules description Extraction of decision-making rules based on rough set  theory can be described as follow: Assume that there is a decision-making system S = (U, C  D, V, ?), a?  R, where U = {x1, x2,?,xn}is the object set, also known as the theory of domains, where xi is the object (tuple); C and D are condition attribute and decision-making attribute respectively; V is a collection of attribute values that represents the attribute value range of attribute.

? is an information function, which gives an attribute value for each attribute of each object x. For any x ?U, a decision-making rule can be expressed as fx, recorded as ? fCi(x) ? fD(x), where Ci shows several   condition attributes, fCi(x) represents the attribute value Ci of object x.

Support and confidence are parameter of the measure rules.

Conditional attributes and decision attribute are divided according whether they have the same value or not, C= {Ei},  D= {Yj} were gained, and support sp=  Ei Yj U  ,  confidence cf=  Ei Yj Ei  . Support reveals the importance of the rules while confidence reveals the reliability of the rules. When cf = 1, the rule [4] which is generated by lower approximate set is definite. When Ei  Yi= , rules can?t be created.

B. Rules extraction Attribute reduction is the core of the rough set theory,  and its final goal is generating decision-making rules.

Generally speaking, the process of generating decision- making rules has two steps: First, solving the reduction of condition attributes in decision-making table. Second, simplified decision-making rules are gained by eliminating redundance condition attribute value of decision-making rules in decision-making table. In a decision-making system, if some objects have the same attribute value but does not belong to a same decision-making class, the objects can be called inconsistent object, otherwise, they are called consistent object. If all the objects are inconsistent objects in the decision-making system, which can be called complete inconsistent decision-making system, or else, it can be called complete consistent decision-making system. It can be called inconsistent decision-making system if it has consistent object and inconsistent object. If attribute dependability =1, the decision-making system is consistent, or else, it is inconsistent decision-making system that include complete consistent decision-making system and complete inconsistent decision-making system [5].

In reality, decision-making originate in raw data are mostly inconsistent decision-making system, not only need  the consistent decision-making rules to be extracted, but also need the inconsistent decision-making rules to be extracted.

Algorithm of rules extraction in this paper is heuristic algorithm based on dependence and attribute importance [6].

Step1. The core P= coreD(C) of decision-making system can be solved, it is a union of necessary condition attributes about decision-making attributes.

Step2.  Select attribute a between C and D, so as to make attribute a? s importance about D unequal to zero.

Step3.  P= P {a}, while attribute dependence =1, the algorithm is terminated, or else, go to Step2.



III. REALIZATION OF THE ALGORITHM  A. The building of decision-making system A decision-making system was built by discretizing 600  records which gathered from the decomposing furnace of cement production process, it is shown in Table I:  As is shown in Table 1, the objects set U = {1, 2 ... ...

68}, condition attributes C = {c1, c2, c3, c4}, decision attributes D = {d}. The ?count? indicates the number of times which the living line appears in initial decision-making system. So the number of targets set is   greatly reduced. The number of positive region ( , )POS C D = 89 that the condition attributes C relative to decision attributes D can be calculated according the decision-making system.

TABLE I.  DATA DECISION-MAKING TABLE OF DECOMPOSING FURNACE IN CEMENT PRODUCTION PROCESS  id count c1 c2 c3 c4 d 1 6 -1 -1 -1 0 0 2 5 -1 -1 -1 0 1 3 1 -1 -1 0 0 1 4 2 -1 -1 0 1 1 5 1 -1 -1 1 -1 0  ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 20 75 -1 1 1 0 0 21 28 -1 1 1 0 1 22 3 0 -1 -1 -1 0 23 5 0 -1 -1 0 0 24 8 0 -1 -1 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 39 26 0 0 0 1 0 40 61 0 0 0 1 1 41 12 0 0 1 -1 0 42 6 0 0 1 -1 1 43 32 0 0 1 1 0 44 66 0 0 1 1 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 68 1 1 1 1 1 1       B. Attribute reduction Calculate the number of positive domain which condition  attributes relative to decision attributes after reducing a condition attribute.

( { 1} , )P O S C c D?  = 50.                        (1)  ( { 2}, )P O S C c D?  = 28.                        (2)  ( { 3}, )POS C c D?  = 41.                        (3)  ( { 4}, )P O S C c D?  = 22.                        (4)  The four values above are less than 89, consequently, every condition attribute can?t be omitted, and the attribute don?t need to be reduced. So the core of the decision-making system S is C itself.

C. Decision-making rules extraction  Dependence degree ? = ( , )P O S C D  U =0.148 which decision attribute depends on condition attribute can be calculated according the decision-making system. So the decision-making system is inconsistent decision-making system, and the system can be divided into completely consistent decision-making system S1 and completely inconsistent decision-making system S2.

S1 consists of the objects whose ID are 3-6, 9, 12-14, 19, 22, 27-29, 32-34, 37, 38, 45-49, 52-54, 57, 58, 67, 68 respectively, it is shown in Table II; S2 consists of the objects which are generated by S-S1, it is shown in Table III.

COMPLETELY CONSISTENT DECISION-MAKING SYSTEM S1  id count  c1 c2 c3 c4 d 3 1 -1 -1 0 0 1 4 2 -1 -1 0 1 1 5 1 -1 -1 1 -1 0 6 22 -1 -1 1 1 1 9 2 -1 0 -1 0 1   37 15 0 0 0 -1 0 38 1 0 0 0 0 1   68 1 1 1 1 1 1   Let support degree of rules be 10%, confidence level be  50%, all the records in consistent decision-making system S1 don?t satisfy the condition that depend degree is more than 10%, so rule extraction need not to do. Rules which are shown in Table IV can be extracted with decision-making system S3.

D. Interpretation of rules and optimization suggestion Take the first rule in table 4 as an example, in the history  data, the first rule shows that occurring probability of d is 72.81% under the condition of decreasing c1, increasing c2, keeping c4 constant, then the occurring probability of the rule is 14.68%. The interpretation of the rule is that when the collecting volume of raw is decreasing and the volume of  coal feeding in decomposing furnace is increasing, inadequate burning of coal powder can be caused, the content of co is increasing, so is the content of co from the outlet of c1, and temperature of decomposing furnaces? outlet will increasing. The second rule shows that the temperature of the decomposing furnaces? out let can be controlled through controlling tertiary air, this conclusion is consistent with the workers? experience, so it verify the effectiveness of the method.

Results analysis and comparison Comparing the test result with the mining algorithm and  conclusion mentioned in document [8] [9], it can be easily discovered that there are some drawbacks in applying classic association rule mining algorithm to flow industry: First, objects of association rules mining mainly is the association of transactions in transaction database rather than the association of trend between attributions. Second, for the mining of consecutive value, method of interval division is mostly used, transforming to Boolean type, mining association rules. The method has limitation obviously, uncertainties can be found in the process of interval division, different method of interval division will results in different mining results, it is inconvenient for data analyzing and processing.



IV. CONCLUSION This paper presents a method of process control rules  mining based on rough ret theory, the method is used for the rules extraction of data sets obtained from the data acquisition system. It lowers the computation complexity comparing with common association rules. The shortcoming     is that the paper only pays attention to static database. Since data in practical application is updated frequently, how to modify the current knowledge reduction and rule set dynamically remains an unsolved problem. Rough set theory which is a developing theory, therefore, it needs to combine with other intelligent computational technologies, such as fuzzy theory and neural network, so as to solve complicated problem of process industry. All topics mentioned above need further research.
