Process Recommendation Based on Association Rules  and Transaction Context

Abstract? This paper proposes a new process recommendation approach on supplying some related processes for choice when users start their business. The process recommendation model is based on the association rules and transaction context, and it aims at mining the potential associated relationship between processes, which can help organizations and users to improve their work efficiency. In this paper, we not only describe the algorithm of realizing this model in details, but also carry out some experiments to find out the factors that affect the efficiency of recommending in our model.

I.  INTRODUCTION (HEADING 1) Business Intelligence (BI) is the tool that turns the  corporation?s current data to the knowledge and then helps the corporation to make the wise business decision. On the other hand, in recent years, the Business Process Management (BPM) technology is widely applied in many corporations, which makes the corporations easier for understanding, analyzing, realizing and improving their business process, and actually many corporations or organizations have built their relevant process library. Now most of corporations quite hope that they can integrate their business process with BI systems so that to help improving the efficiency.

At present, there are three kinds of integration of BI products and BPM: BI is over the process, BI is embedded into the process and event-driven BI, which respectively means: BI uses the process as the data source, BI is used when implementing the process and BI uses the process to increase the information that supply to the users. However, the above- mentioned modes of integration only take certain information of process into consideration, based on which, the management adjust the internal resources of certain processes or improve some links of them, but they do not analyze the associated relationship between those processes, therefore they cannot discover the hidden information which is helpful for users.

This paper proposes a fire-new process recommendation method based on the association rules and transaction context  in order to recommend the correlative appropriate processes to organizations and users, so that they can quickly learn the needed combination of business processes, and finally achieve the high operation efficiency for enterprises and quick launch of related business process for users.

In the field of data mining, applying the association rules technology can well find the associated or mutual relationship between data items. In this paper, we creatively combine the association rules technology with transaction context and then use them in the process recommendation to find the behavior patterns of users when they make or use the workflow processes, meanwhile to explore the association rules between the processes and then filter and recommend them to achieve the final purpose of process recommendation.

The reminder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce two scenarios of applying the process recommendation model that we propose. And then some related works done by other scholars are briefly introduced in Section 3. In Section 4, we show the algorithm of process recommendation in details, including definition and pseudo code. In Section 5, several experiments are conducted to validate the proposed model and algorithm. The last section concludes the whole paper and presents some future research directions.



II. MOTIVATING SCENARIO In order to describe the necessity of our proposed process recommendation approach, we will show two scenarios.

2.1 Business Process Designers Scenario  When business process designers need to make some processes, they always confine themselves in their stark thought. So in order to change this situation, we can use process recommendation to these process makers. That is, according to the processes which a corporation has made, try to find other processes which other corporations always make when they have made the same processes, and then recommend the found processes result to the corporation process makers for choice. The scenario is illustrated as Figure1.

2.2 Process Users Scenario  In general, when users participate in or apply for a business, they usually go to retrieve the appropriate process library to find related business processes as a reference, and then start the retrieved process to meet or fulfill their business needs. However, sometimes, in order to participate in a certain business, users need to start multiple processes. On the other hand, after applying for certain business, users may also need to apply for some other related business, which means, users may need to start some related processes when they have started certain processes. Hence, according to the processes that users start, we recommend the related processes to users by using our proposed process recommendation method. This scenario is also illustrated as Figure 1. Designers/Users    Figure 1.  Process Makers/Starters Scenario    As the two scenarios described above, the usage of process recommendation model supplies the valid recommendation information of related processes for users, and then it will help corporations and users to improve the operation efficiency, as well as to break limitation of thinking.



III. RELATED WORK As the developing of Internet, the recommendation  technology is becoming a hot point of research, and many kinds of recommender systems (RS) have been developed as well. Mooney and Roy proposed a RS based on the content for book recommendation [2]. For movie and news recommendation, Konstan, Miller, et al. developed a RS applying collaborative filtering [4]. Yong et al. proposed a RS also based on collaborative filtering for e-commerce sites by analyzing customer navigational patterns [5]. According to the similarities between web resources and users? interests, Webpersonalizer designed a RS to recommend web information [8]. Li and Zhong proposed a web mining model for extracting approximate concepts hidden in user profiles and gathering information, so that it could make recommendation more efficient [6,7]. Yeong et al. proposed a novel approach in which customer buying behavior were taken in consideration to improve the quality of RS based on collaborative filtering [10]. Kagie et al. designed a graphic shopping interface to recommend the similar products. Based on product attributes, this RS represents the mutual similarities of recommended products in a two dimensional map [1].

About the integration of RS and workflow process, there are some scholars to research this area too. Zhen et al. proposed a workflow-based RS model on supplying proper knowledge to  proper members in collaborative team contexts rather than daily life scenarios. In this recommendation system, it used the information about relationships among members, roles and tasks that workflow in collaborative team contains and collaborative filtering to obtain members? demands for knowledge [3]. In order to recommend a correct node, Zhang et al. proposed a new workflow recommendation technique, called FlowRecommender. It could produce a correct recommendation of the next node even if the upstream nodes/sub-paths were not immediately connected with this node [9].



IV. ALGORITHM In this section, we will discuss in details the algorithm of  our proposed process recommendation which use the association rules technology and transaction context.

4.1 Definitions and Conceptions  Process Item Set. The process item set is the set of some process schemes. Suppose { }1 2, ,..., nF f f f= is a process item set, then ( 1,2,3,..., )if i n=  represents a specific process scheme.

Process Transaction. The process transaction is the set of process instances that a company has made or user has started.

A process transaction and its context form a record in process library. Suppose there is a process transaction, we sign as T, then T F? , where F is the set of all process items. Every process transaction has the only identification.

Process Transaction Set. The process transaction set is a set of kinds of process transactions. Suppose there is a process transaction set signed as D, and 1 2{ , ,..., }nD T T T= , in this formula,   ( 1,2,3,..., )iT i n=  represents a process transaction.

Process Associated Rule. The process associated rule is formatted as A?B, in which A and B are process item sets, and we have A F? , B F? , A B? = ? . There are two parameters to describe the attribute of process associated rule:  a). Confidence. The confidence measures the degree that the rule would be believed. Let A and B are two process item sets. For process transaction set, signed as D, we have A D? ? B D? , A B? = ? . Then the confidence of A B?  could be defined as the following formulae:  count of transaction including A and B(A B) count of transaction including A  Confidence ? = (1)    The confidence shows the probability of process item set B appears when process item set A appears in process transaction set D. For example, the corporation that uses the process of produce-control has the probability of 90% to use the process of produce-dispatch. This relationship can be expressed as:  Confidence (produce-control ? produce-dispatch) = 90%.

Input: Process Library L the Context M that user belongs, process set S that have been made or started Output: the process set recommended D ? {transactions set whose context is M in process library L}; C1 ?{Candidate1-itemsets };  //Find all frequent process item set L1 = {c?C1| c.sup ? min_sup}; For(k=2;Lk-1??;k++) { Ck = sc_candidate(Lk-1,min_sup);  forall transactions t?D { Ct = subset(Ck,t); //find Candidate Set in  transactions t forall candidates c ? Ct do  c.sup++;  } Lk = {c?Ck|c.sup ? min_sup};    }  return L = ? k Lk;  // Mine Associated Rules for all ?k in L{         //?k is the k-frequent process items set  for all ?k ? ?k{ if(conf(?k ? ?m) ? minConf) { AR = AR ? (?k ? ?m);      }   }  }  return AR;  //General Recommendation Set if S is Empty  then s_recommend = max_support(L1); else  s_recommend = search_Rules (S,AR);  //return the processes that are associated rules of S in AR  return s recommend;  b). Support. This parameter describes the probability that process item sets A and B appear at the same time in all the process transactions. The support of A?B is defined as the following formulae:  countof transaction including A and B( ) count of all transactions  Support A B? = (2)    For instance, in a process library, there are 1000 business works which amount to process transactions. Among these business works, there are 100 works use the process of produce-control and produce-dispatch at the same time. Then the support of ?produce-control process? produce-dispatch process? is 10%.

Frequent Process Item Set. The frequent process item set is the item set of process items whose support is bigger than or equal to the minimal support (signed as min_sup) that users set.

Strong Associated Rule among Processes. This rule is the associated rule that the support and confidence both are bigger than or equal to the minimal support and minimal confidence (signed as min_conf).

Process Transaction Context. This means the users environment of applying process transactions. In this paper, it mainly refers to the types of business that users first use the process to deal with.

4.2 Algorithm  Base on the definition and conception above, we propose the process recommendation method which integrates the association rules and transaction context. The procedures of this method will be described step by step as following.

1) Collect Recommendation Data Resource: Collect process library data that each corporation establishes or user uses.

Store the mapping relationship of the corporations or users with their corresponding processes transaction as well as the transaction context which they belong to in the database, so that to form the process data set which will be recommended.

2) Classify Data Set: Classify the process data set that collected in the first step according to process transaction context. This step will actually reduce the scope of the data set considered, in order to avoid generating the invalid associated rules, so that it can recommend credible and useful information to the users.

3) Mine Associated Rules: Based on the data set after the above classifying, we deal with every classification as the two following phases.

a) Find all the frequent process item sets. According to the definition ahead and basic conception, the frequency of these process item sets is bigger than or at least equals to the minimal support that users defined at first.

b) General strong associated rules from frequent process item sets. Among the frequent process item sets that found from the phase a, find rules that confidence is bigger than or equals to the minimal confidence users defined, and then get the strong associated rules between the processes.

4) General Recommendation Set and Recommend: Based on the process strong associated rules mined by step 3 and the situation of processes made or started, we can recommend relative processes to users.

a) No processes have been made or started: In this situation, there is no process as a reference, which could be thought as the cold start problem, so then we can recommend the processes that have the maximal support in the user?s domain, according to the transaction context.

b) Some processes have been made or started. In this case, just find the relative processes in the associated rules, at the same time, take the transaction context into consideration, and then get recommendation set, and recommend to users.

The whole algorithm is presented in Figure 2.

V. EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION In this section, we show experimental evaluation of the technique that we propose for process recommendation. The experiments are set in the environment of Windows Win7 operating system with a main memory of 2G, the program is developed in Java, and the database is MySQL.

5.1 Design of Experiments  We set these experiments in order to realize the process recommendation system that we introduce, and then make further efforts to find the factors that affect the efficiency of recommending.

In experiments, we simulate some process data of the reality, and then insert them into the database to form the process library. The process items are collected from many companies used. Then choose several process items randomly to constitute a transaction; besides, set one parameter of the transaction to marker its context. So do these operations above for cycle thousands of times, and then it will form a huge process library, based on which we set our experiments.

We guess the factors affected the efficiency of recommending being the size of set of all process items, the maximum number that one transaction contains process items and the number of whole transactions. It touches upon three variables, so we set two variables fixed every experiment, and then research the relationship between the other variable and the efficiency. We use the time that from beginning to generating the final recommending process set and the number of strong associated rules mined to represent the efficiency of our recommending system.

5.2  Experimental Result and Analyzing  We set the minimal support and confidence both to be 20% uniformly in experiments so that to get a clear result.

1) Size of Process Item set and Efficiency  To get the relation between the size of process items and the efficiency of recommendation, we fix the number of transactions to be 10000, which means there are 10000 transactions in the process library, and the size of transaction to be 15, which means one transaction can contain 15 process items at most. The result is illustrated by Figure 3. From Figure 3, we can see that number of strong associated rules generated becomes smaller as the size of process items getting bigger; and the time of generating result is almost unchanged.

This is because, when the size of process item set becomes bigger, it means that the combination of process items in one transaction is getting more. This would lead to that the frequent process item set which satisfy the minimal support getting smaller, and finally lead to the reduction of strong associated rules number.

Figure 3. Size of process item set and efficiency  2) Size of Transaction and Efficiency  In this experiment, we also fix the number of transactions to be 10000 and the size of process item set to be 10. Figure 4 shows the relationship between the size of transaction and the efficiency. We can see that as the size of one transaction getting bigger, the number of strong associated rules generated becomes bigger too, and the time is almost unchanged the same with the last experiment. The reason is that, when the number of process items one transaction containing is bigger, the process items that transactions overlap become more. This means there are more chance to satisfy the minimal support and confidence, and finally to improve the number of strong associated rules.

Figure 4. Size of transaction and efficiency  3) Number of Transactions and Efficiency  We fix the size of transaction to be 15 and the size of process item set to be 10 in this experiment to get the relationship between the number of transactions and efficiency. As showing in Figure 5, the result is that, as the number of transactions increasing, the number of strong associated rules mined reduces and the time increases. This    can be explained that, with the increase in the number of transactions, the denominator of generating frequent process item set becomes bigger, and then lead to the frequent process item set becomes smaller, and so does strong associated rules number. And the time increases too, with the increase in the number of transactions.

Figure 5. Number of transactions and efficiency  From these experiments, we can see that the efficiency of our recommending system is proportional to the size of transaction, and inverse to the size of process item set and the number of transactions. The time of generating result is proportional to the number of transactions, but not related to the other two factors basically.



VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK In this paper, we propose a new process recommendation  approach based on the association rules and transaction context to mine the associated relationship between processes, so that to help organizations and users to improve their work efficiency. And then we describe the algorithm of realizing this model in details.

However, there exist some limitations for the current model and algorithm, which need further studies in future:  1. The method that we propose to mine he associated relationship is only based on the association rules and transaction context. And we can try other methods to mine in future, for example, collaborative filtering and so on.

2. The algorithm to mine associated rules in Section 4 is not so good both in time complexity or space complexity. On the other hand, when some new records are added to the process library, the algorithm will need to calculate again from beginning to obtain the new associated rules. This efficiency is quite low, and we would do something to improve the algorithm performance.
