Abstract? T-53 series engines1are presently being used all over the world in aerial platforms such as helicopters.

These provide highly competitive performance.

Maintenance of these engines is therefore considered important for higher reliability during operations, low Mean Time Between Failures and operating cost. As a regular practice, data of defects is continuously gathered by all users as maintenance history. Present research was focused on collection of this data for numerous engines followed by statistical analysis to establish various trends.

Outcome of these results could be useful or maintenance crew and operators could devise their preventive maintenance strategies as well as establish inventory levels of critical components, assemblies and system.
