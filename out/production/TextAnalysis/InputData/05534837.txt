Abstract-- A considerable number of institutions, companies and societies demand and trust the possibility of a sustainable world where the energetic production is based on renewable sources.

Most likely future problem of the no-controllable renewable electric production (mainly wind and solar) may be the temporally variability. To follow the power demand is necessary controllable generation. The paper analyses based on hypothetical situations how to manage through storage systems the no-controllable productions to get the complete substitution of the no-renewable power plants. Data from real renewable plants has been used to explore in big electric systems (Spain) the optimal sizing of said storage systems. It is shown that with a potential renewable overproduction around 150% versus a yearly demand only a 1.5% energy storage capacity versus demand should be necessary.

I. INTRODUCTION Currently electric generation systems from renewable sources are experiencing an important development all over the world, particularly wind and solar. It is interesting to mention the European Directive, which aims by 2020 a 20% fulfilment of the electrical demand from renewable sources [8]. The great progress of renewable sources systems has been motivated by different reasons; the most remarkable are the following. In one hand, the increasing demand of the society for technical, financial and environmental sustainable systems. In the other hand, the excellent financial results, the correct operation and the demonstrated adaptation to technological and legislative changes of most of the renewable generation systems which are currently operational. That has been achieved due to the commitment and good execution of most of the companies of the renewable industry as well as the governmental financial support at national and international scale.

In spite of the big industrial progress and the continuous technological improvements over the last years, renewable generation systems may still be classified into two important groups: controllable and no-controllable generation. The controllable one corresponds mostly to biomass and hydraulic electric plants, while no-controllable is the one which depends on environmental conditions, mainly wind and solar.

Controllable renewable generation is integrated into the grid easily since it uses conventional technology, which in addition is a competitive advantage to participate in electric markets. However, no-controllable renewable generation presents a certain number of issues for its integration into the electric grid. Many of them, for instance, harmonics, flicker, voltage dip, over voltage, reactive control, islanding, grid restarting su1pport (blackout), etc., are problems already   1 This work was supported in part by technical expert from different departments of the company Acciona Energ?a. In particular, Grid Connection, R&D and Eng&Construction Departments.

overcome or in a resolution process in the latest technology renewable plants [5]. Nevertheless, the influence in the grid of variable power systems is still an outstanding issue. As no-controllable generation level remains low, the mentioned influence results insignificant or only problematic (either technically or due to market conditions) in specific situations as weak grids (islands, continental remote areas or inadequately interconnected, etc.). While penetration level increases, the mentioned grid integration issue may even determine the admissible limit of this type of generation.

This problem has been studied in depth technically and economically during the last years [6]. Many authors have provided various solutions depending on the different situations, although the most extended and common one for the majority of them is to use storage systems as power regulator [7]. Those systems may smooth power fluctuations, reduce short and medium term forecast errors, provide power warranty, participate in a safe way in secondary markets, etc. Thus, depending on the storage capacity and the implementation of a correct control strategy, it may be reduced the random nature of the no- controllable production until reaching a situation where it may be considered as fully controllable. Therefore, this scenario would place no-controllable generation in the same grid integration situation as currently controllable generation is, hence with the same chance to participate in the electric markets.

Many of the analyzed scenarios are either small electric systems or isolated, islands or similar. On those studies, storage sizing methods to optimize economically the grid integration of renewable systems are shown [1]. In some cases even the conditions for a full replacement of current no-renewable sources by either wind or solar or a combination of both arise [2]. The present paper has also as objective to explore the possibilities and characteristics that have to be verified for total or partial replacement of no- renewable generators in big size isolated systems.

Particularly, studies have been performed within regional scale (Navarra) and within national scale (Spain). For that, they have been collected wind, solar, biomass, etc real production measurements data over the last years from Acciona Energ?a renewable plants1. Those data have been extrapolated to analyze hypothetical situations of high renewable penetration level in the grid. As it will be shown, a numerical simulation system has been used in order to analyze in a systematic way various scenarios with different production and storage levels. Normalized results are shown graphically in order to generalize the conclusions.

Several analyses have been performed to validate them. As it is shown in the present paper, energy storage systems at the current situation only may help to improve financial results (for instance, reducing forecast errors). Even the European Directive, 20% of renewable production by 2020,    does not mean a challenge which justifies energy storage systems. However, the hypothetical long term complete energetic replacement by renewable sources would require big storage systems. Nevertheless, the capacity of those storage systems will depend on the potential overproduction level of all renewable plants installed. Nowadays, in Spain the potential generation versus the electric demand is approximately 175% [4]. However, according to the results obtained the demand may be completely fulfilled using mainly no-controllable renewable generation with a overproduction of 150% and a storage capacity of 1.5% versus the yearly demand.

All those studies form a research topic recently initiated.

And therefore, most results should be considered preliminary.

Neither financial analysis nor environmental one involved have already started. In addition, the complete analysis should provide a clear technical-financial overview free of prejudices with respect to other energetic substitution options, as nuclear which have recently returned to public debate forums internationally.



II. PROBLEMATIC OF THE RANDOM NATURE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES   A. Energy sources and demand  Renewable energy from wind and solar sources are rapidly increasing their influence in the electric grid system worldwide. Both energy sources are uncontrollable by nature.

Because of that when their contributions become important, locally and at greater scales, several and well reported grid integration problems may arise. Although energy demand and renewable production are random in nature, demand usually maintains a clear tendency that allows its reliable forecasting.

Demand keeps a very close profile in a daily cycle depending on working and no working days, (Fig. 1). As it is shown on Fig. 2, in a yearly basis, demand follow a similar profile having a small increase every year with respect to previous one. For example, 2006 electric demand versus 2005 verified an increase around 2.9%, while 2006 versus 2007 was about 3.8% [4].

B. Energetic unbalance and losses  In a preliminary stage it is introduced the following basic energetic balance valid for any isolated electric system.

Non Renewable Power + Potential Renewable Power  = Power Demand + System Power Losses + Renewable Power Losses   In this equation, Non Renewable Power represents all  power contributions coming from classic energy sources such as coal, gas, nuclear, co-generation, etc ?based power plants.

Potential Renewable Power is the power that could be produced at any moment taking into account all operative power plants of wind, solar, hydro, etc. This amount of power depends on the primary source availability and the technology efficiency. Power demand is the electric power demanded for users, System Power Losses represents power losses in lines, transformers, etc, and Renewable Power Losses represents the renewable power that was not transformed into the electric system. Several aspects are involved with this concept. The integration of all Renewable Power Losses during a year from now on will be called the Renewable Energy Losses.

Fig 1. Example of daily electric demand in Spain (working and non  working day) REE source of data    Fig. 2. Yearly electric demand in Spain. REE source of data     A few years ago the Renewable Energy Losses were insignificant because grid operation rules on most countries were establishing priority for the new renewable sources in detriment of conventional ones. However, nowadays several countries with high wind energy penetration have been changing the rules to allow grid operators to stop wind generation under the excuse of low quality of service or low reliability of the operation. Despite of the ethical debate about all these particular aspects, these new losses are becoming important and will increase during next years unless newer grid stability solutions were provided.

The above mentioned energy losses are hard to be either calculated or estimated. Nevertheless apart of those losses, as no-controllable renewable energy penetration increases, energy opportunity production losses due to demand limitation shall be added. It may happen that no- controllable renewable production exceeds the electric demand and as consequence renewable generation must be limited. Thus, Renewable Energy Losses are mainly due to two different causes, grid operation and over production stops.

Fig. 3 and 4 show normalized hourly potential productions coming from no-controllable renewable energy sources versus maximum hourly demand value. Two different cases are considered, Spain and Navarra Region (data from 2007). On Spanish case is appreciated that the potential production is always well below the demand curve. Potential Renewable production never reaches the electric demand, which means that in principle Renewable Energy Losses should zero. However, analyzing Navarra case; potential renewable production is higher than electric demand in a large number of hourly intervals. Assuming Navarra were an isolated electric system (which is not the case); no controllable renewable plants should be stopped increasing considerable the Renewable Energy Losses.

Fig. 5 shows normalized Renewable Energy Losses considering different ratios of Potential Renewable Production versus electric demand. This graph is about the analysis carried out in a big size isolated system where no- renewable energy contribution has been minimized using renewable energy (wind and solar). ?X? axis represents the yearly energy production associated to different values of Potential Renewable Power versus the yearly electric demand. From now on this ratio will be named Renewable Potential Production Ratio (RPPR). ?Y? axis represents the percentage of Renewable Power Losses. Although the results obtained depend on the specific production and demand profiles used, no big differences have been found while using different ones. It is remarkable that only very big ratios of Potential Renewable Power versus electric demand achieve complete demand fulfilment, which involves extremely huge Renewable Energy Losses. The main reason of those Renewable Power Losses is the necessity of stopping renewable production plants as demand is lower than available production. Even though current scenarios of renewable production differ considerably with those shown on Fig. 5, clearly it is appreciated that not only renewable production plants are required, but additional elements to optimize the global energy management are needed.

Following conclusions are obtained upon the mentioned figure: - Renewable real production (inst. demand line) does not  fulfil the electric demand within a reasonable renewable overproduction. Analyzing several real (but extrapolated) renewable production-demand systems, big enough to be able to warranty at least a small quantity of power any time; only with RPPR ratios higher than 25 the electrical demand is fulfilled. This is absolutely unviable and absurd. Considering small renewable production-demand systems where renewable production may be zero at least during a short interval of time the required RPPR tends to infinite. May be considering new renewable technologies (marine sources), the total production could reduce the variability [3].

- As it is shown on Fig. 5, Renewable Energy Losses, begins to be considerable with RPPR ratios higher than 0.5. Those losses have been calculated as result of stopping the non controllable renewable plants as the Potential Renewable Power is higher than the electric demand. Actually Renewable Energy Losses are always higher than those shown on the graph, since grid operators will not allow the current renewable technologies (solar and wind) to be the only ones to fulfil the electric demand. For instance, considering Spanish electric system, Fig. 3 shows that no Renewable Energy Losses should happen since RPPR ratio is very small.

Another example is the Spanish region of Navarra which has a RPPR value of 0.6. As a connected electric system, Renewable Energy Losses are not verified. However on the hypothetical case of being isolated, such Renewable Energy Losses would be around 5% (distance between inst. demand and pot. renewable production lines at Navarra RPPR line on Fig.5).

- The distance between the Real Renewable Production (inst. demand line) and the 100% line is the percentage of today no-renewable energy contribution. This energy should be controllable renewable energy (biomass, hydro, H2 plants, etc.) if in the future no-renewable  contribution is avoided. However, in most of the countries will not be feasible to get this amount of controllable renewable production. Therefore to get the 100% renewable target in most RPPR will require a great amount of no-controllable production which again will produce excessive Renewable Energy Losses. For example, for RPPR around 1.3, the total Renewable Energy Losses are the same as the renewable production directly delivered to the grid.

The Renewable Energy Losses and the necessary  controllable renewable energy may also be strongly reduced when energy storages are included in the electric system.

Such energy storages will not be necessary huge. For example, when it is combined wind power and storage under a common control system, it is possible to operate the system like a controllable energy sources or as close as desired. This means that the combined system may offer similar characteristics than conventional plants, opening new technical features for a better integration and also new possibilities on the electric market.

III. SIMULATION OF ISOLATED ELECTRIC SYSTEMS WITH ENERGY STORAGE  The aim of the following study is to determine the minimum storage capacity which allows to isolated electric systems with any RPPR value fulfil the following conditions:   - To warranty the electric demand in big systems (country  electric system size) - To minimize the no-renewable production - To minimize Renewable Energy Losses - To be based on a stationary multi-annual study   For those studies it has been required to develop simulation conditions of electric systems including renewable and no renewable sources as well as big energy storage system. Also due to the current status of big storage technologies, in order to simplify it has been considered only water storage systems with the corresponding pumps and turbines to fill and empty the mentioned storage. Preliminary studies performed have used production and demand Spanish data. Controllable renewable production data have been extrapolated from the data only available on a specific Spanish region. No-controllable renewable data have been obtained from previous years measurements.

For this analysis hourly periods have been used. As it will be shown later, desired accuracy is reached comparing with longer periods (daily, monthly). Thus, in each hourly interval, the energetic balance of the system must be solved.

Fig. 6 shows a simplified diagram for this process. On this algorithm, overproduction and underproduction versus electric demand situations are distinguished. In order to fulfil electric demand, renewable production has been considered as priority regarding the no-renewable production. Depending on the situation it is verified whether free capacity exists to storage the overproduction or whether stored energy exists to complement the underproduction. According to the results  and on the storage capacity, stored level will increase, decrease or be limited. Although on Fig.6 is not specified, the real algorithm used includes all the energy losses processes (efficiencies, rate limits etc.). Among all the magnitudes required to characterize the system operation, the following are the most relevant:  - Renewable Energy Losses - No-renewable contribution - Stored energy level sequence  A. Stationary multi annual simulation  In order to get representative simulation results it is necessary to have as many data as possible. It is advisable to have at least three years data. Yearly demand and production increases must be taken into account to obtained results valid for the near future. In any case, simulation process involves the consecution of the stationary state. Fig.

7 shows results obtained considering Navarra data (real case with a RPPR = 0.6) using the methodology explained above. On this figure, hourly potential renewable production and demand have been normalized versus the maximum demand while stored energy level has been normalized versus the storage capacity at RPPR=1. Taking into account the above mentioned RPPR value (0.6), the complete fulfilment of the electric demand only by renewable sources is not feasible.

However, in case of isolated system the optimum storage management will allow full use of the eventual overproduction peaks with no Renewable Energy Losses, and thus optimising the use of all renewable sources. Fig. 7 shows how the interval between 7,000 and 8,000 hours verifies the larger overproduction density becoming the most influent for determining the optimum storage capacity (19,400 MWh).

Fig. 6. Energetic balance algorithm based on renewable production priority       Fig. 7. Normalized Renewable Production, demand and energy stored level  for Navarra Case during 2007   Figs. 8 and 9 show hypothetical cases of Navarra as an isolated system with RPPR = 1.0 and 1.2 respectively. In both cases the available renewable energy should be enough to supply the demand with no other contribution (no-renewable should be null). For both cases the stored energy has been normalized versus the optimal storage capacity at RPPR=1.

As it can be observed, for RPPR = 1.2 the necessary storage capacity is around one third lower than the required for RPPR =1. The reason for so big difference storage capacity is mainly due to the larger percentage of hours in which renewable production is directly delivered to the grid. It is verified that the higher the RPPR the lower the optimum storage but also the higher the Renewable Energy Losses.

Following the procedure described, Fig. 10 shows the optimal storage volume required to fulfil the electrical demand with minimal no-renewable contribution for any RPPR value. On this curve two different operation conditions are distinguished:  - RPPR ? 1: Within this range there is no possibility to  fulfil the electrical demand only by means of renewable sources. However, Renewable Energy Losses are equal zero and no-renewable contribution gets minimized.

Point 1.

- RPPR ? 1: Within this range it is feasible to fulfil the electric demand just with renewable energy. No- renewable contribution is not necessary. However, Renewable Energy Losses are produced for RPPR higher than 1. Point 4.

For RPPR =1 is verified that the no-renewable  contribution and the Renewable Energy Losses are both zero although a huge storage is required. Above the Critical Storage Curve same characteristics are expected (point 5) although with a storage higher than the minimum required.

However, below the critical curve (points 2 and 3) the storage capacity is not enough to assure minimal values of no- renewable contribution and Renewable Energy Losses. All marked points on Fig 10 have the same storage capacity and table 1 summarizes their operational conditions according to the characteristics already determined. All energy values shown on the table have been normalized versus the yearly electric demand. As it is described subsequently, different renewable production profiles produce different Critical Storage Curve. The importance of those variations is related to the scale factor.

Fig. 10. Normalized Critical Storage Curve at different RPPR   TABLE I  NORMALISED OPERATIONAL POINTS FOR STORAGE CAPACITY RATIO = 0.02    Point RPPR  Ren.

Energy Losses  (%)  Non Renewable  Contribution (%)  Stored Energy  Supplied (%)  0 0.30 0.0 70 0 1 0.75 0.0 25 13.1 2 0.90 2.6 12.6 20.7 3 1.10 13.2 3.2 25.3 4 1.33 33.0 0 24.5 5 1.6 60.0 0 22.0 6 ? ? 2,700 0 0   Point ?0? on table 1 corresponds to very low RPPR values where no storage is required to optimize the potential renewable production. This is consequence of very limited production sequences with no overproduction at any moment during the year. A similar situation but no critical was shown of Fig. 3. Another remarkable point is ?6? that corresponds with very high RPPR values (according to    simulations should be at least higher than 25). In this unrealistic situation, no storage is required because the minimal renewable production is always over the demand at any moment. However, almost all potential production will become Renewable Energy Losses. A similar situation was pointed out on Fig. 5.

B. Sampling time influence  In order to verify the reliability of the results obtained through the simulation procedure several analyses have been performed. First one attempt to determine the minimal measurement interval advisable (monthly, daily, hourly, etc).

Fig. 11 shows the Critical Storage Curve calculated with different measurement intervals. As it was foreseen, considering monthly measurement intervals the required storage is significantly lower than the obtained with shorter intervals (daily, hourly). This is consequence of a higher percentage of renewable production directly satisfying the demand with respect to simulations performed with lower sampling times. Critical Storage Capacity curves calculated in hourly and daily measurement intervals basis differ very little. Even in case of using ten-minutes sampling data the Critical Storage Curve is nearly the same as those calculated based on daily and monthly data. However, it has not represented because there were not enough calculated points.

For most analysis, hourly data have been used in most studies.

C. Wind profile influence  The optimal energy storage sizing depends on both demand and renewable production profiles. However, demand profiles present a certain hourly and yearly regularity as it was shown previously, while renewable production profiles may be very different according to locations and scales (the lower the higher differences). In order to show such dependence, critical storage curves for a typical demand profile and four real wind production profiles have been calculated, Fig.12. These wind productions corresponds with four wind farms placed in different regions. In this figure it is clearly appreciated that such difference may be very relevant.

When comparing wind farm ?S? and ?T? at RPPR = 1, the required capacity for wind farm ?S? is almost twice the required for wind farm ?T?. Also the analysis has been performed for a case which considers an average production profile of the four wind farms mentioned previously and which represents the expected evolution in wider regions.

This profile result much more smoothed when it is compared with the independent wind farms, which in turn also leads to smaller storage requirements (?VRST? curve).

D. Pumps and turbines power influence  A storage system requires obviously components which allow energetic loading and unloading processes. To simplify and since the analyzed storage systems are big scale the only mean of storage considered is water and, therefore, hydraulic pumps and turbines will be the components performing energetic exchanges. On the studies previously explained, neither power losses in those elements nor possible maximal power constraints have been considered. Fig. 13 shows the dependence on the optimal storage calculation found in storage systems provided with pumps and turbines with limited power. As it is appreciated the power constraint influence is a determinant factor and must be taken into account in future analysis.

Fig. 11. Critical storage curve for different sampling times     Fig. 12. Influence of different wind generation profiles.

Fig. 13. Influence of power limits in hydraulic pumps and turbines.

Reductions in the pumping system involves a considerably increase on the Renewable Energy Losses while reductions in the turbine system involves requirement of auxiliary energy sources (no-renewable or renewable controllable).



IV. CURRENT SITUATION AND HYPOTHETICAL FUTURE TENDENCIES  In order to carry out studies as much realistic as possible, data provided by Acciona Energ?a from a representative number of existing wind, solar, biomass, etc.

plants have been considered. However to simplify the calculations there was not considered any pump and turbine limitation. Fig. 14 shows again the optimal energy storage calculated as a function of the RPPR. On this figure it has been marked the current RPPR levels of Navarra (0.6) and Spain (0.15). Naturally, it was assumed the error on the interpretations when the scale of both systems is considered. Point ?a? represents the current situation of Navarra, where its high renewable penetration level is appreciated (mainly wind energy). In case of Navarra being an isolated electric system, point ?b? would show the    required storage capacity to minimize the Renewable Energy Losses. Nowadays, because Navarra is an interconnected system such Renewable Energy Losses are not really produced and the eventual production surplus is absorbed by the bordering regions.

Considering the current renewable situation of Spain (RPPR=0.15, point ?A? on the figure), the full potential renewable production is directly delivered to the users, thus no energy storage is required. European plan 2020 which means, a 20% of renewable production versus demand by year 2020, will place Spain on point ?B? (RPPR=0.2). Even in this new situation, an energy storage system is still not justified; in order to minimize Renewable Energy Losses a storage is required only if RPPR >0.3. Once that situation is reached, it will be beneficial to design future plans and to decide which kind of generation will replace the existing no- renewable sources. In case of a renewable decision, it will be necessary to achieve higher values than RPPR=1 to warranty the demand (RPPR>1 in case of existing pumping and turbines constraints). Point RPPR = 1 involves a very big energy storage capacity, approximately 8% of the annual demand. Although it is recommended detailed technical- financial studies it seems reasonable to design systems with certain renewable overproduction. Especially, if it is taken into account the current situation where the level of no- renewable overproduction is around 175% with respect to the annual demand (RPPR=1.75, below Point ?C?). The advisable range zone of RPPR values is the one marked by a circle on Fig. 14 where RPPR levels around 1.5, only should require 1.5% of storage capacity. As a future research, is pending the analysis of how transition between the present situation and the hypothetical situation of a 100% renewable isolated system shall be carried out.



V. CONCLUSIONS   A considerable number of institutions, companies and societies demand and trust the possibility of reaching a sustainable world where the energetic production is based on renewable sources. In the future, the main problem of the no- controllable renewable electric production, which penetration level increases day a day, may be the temporally variability.

To follow the power demand is necessary controllable power generation or some control on the demand itself. As it has been shown, for future systems with high or total renewable electric production this problem may be minimised through storage systems. The current penetration level of renewable sources in the grid would not recommend energy storages except in specific cases. As the penetration level increases, it will be necessary to properly size the energy storage taking into account future demand and production increments. As it has been explained, potential overproduction levels, similar to currently installed with the conventional generation, will allow the demand fulfilment with a global storage system around 1.5% of the annual energy demand.
