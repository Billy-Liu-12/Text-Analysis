Abstract Multi-channel wireless mesh network (WMN) is highlighted in WMNs because of its high data rate and low access delay.  Since WMN is distributed, self-organized and mobile, designing the medium access control (MAC) protocol for multi-channel WMN is a big challenge.  In this paper, we proposed a MAC protocol for multi-channel WMN.  In our scheme, the number of channels can be adjusted freely according to the needs of WMN.  Moreover, the data rate of our scheme is adaptive and the hidden terminal interference can be avoided.  Theoretical analyses and performance evaluations show that our scheme outperforms the proposed common control channel (CCC) in terms of the high throughput and low access delay.

1  Introduction Recently, wireless mesh networks (WMNs) have attracted much attention from both industry and academia. Because the functions of the nodes in WMN are diversified, they outperform those of ad hoc network.  Since mesh routers have the minimal mobility, they can be more complicated than mesh clients in hardware and software.  Advanced techniques, such as multi-radio, multi-channel, efficient medium access schemes, can be applied to the mesh routers.  So, WMNs have higher throughput than ad hoc networks.  Moreover, WMNs have other advantages such as low up-front cost, easy network maintenance, robustness and reliable service coverage.

These advantages make WMNs very attractive and undergo rapid development on broadband home networking, community networking, building automation, high-speed metropolitan area networking, and enterprise networking.

Since WMNs are different from the traditional ad hoc networks, the existing MAC protocols for ad hoc networks are not suitable for WMNs.  The MAC for WMN is still under development.  Several MACs are proposed for WMNs.  To increase the throughput of  WMNs, multi-channel MAC should be applied in WMNs.

There are still many difficulties in multi-channel MAC.

Time division multiple access (TDMA), code division multiple access (CDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), and carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) have been proposed for MAC of ad hoc networks.  Among these access schemes, FDMA and CSMA/CA have been proposed for WMNs in [1].  Transmissions with TDMA need be synchronized, which is suitable for central coordinated system.  When TDMA is used in distributed system, the overhead for synchronization is heavy.  Since WMN is a distributed system, TDMA isn?t suitable for medium access in WMN.  FDMA divides the channels by frequency, and the division is constant after the system is designed.  Therefore, FDMA can?t realize flexible bandwidth allocation.  Moreover, it is not an easy task to allocate the channels for the communication pairs in distributed system.

CSMA/CA is a random access scheme which is widely used in the ad hoc networks.  However the throughput of CSMA/CA is low when the offered load is heavy [2].  CDMA divides channels with spreading codes.

Transmitter and receiver can communicate with each other on condition that they use the same spreading code.  Similar to FDMA, it is hard for CDMA to distribute spreading codes in the distributed system.

Moreover, all these four access schemes above have the hidden terminal problems which can reduce the throughput of networks.

To avoid these problems and enhance the performance of multi-channel WMN, we proposed a MAC scheme named data-rate adaptive hidden terminal problem immune multiple access scheme (DHMA).  In our scheme, there are control channel and data channel which are distinguished by frequency.  On the control channel, distributed coordinate function (DCF) is used for medium access.  On the data channel, spreading codes are used for the data transmissions.  When a source wants to send data to its neighbor, it needs to send spreading code to its neighbor on control channel first and makes a reservation of the spreading code in case of spreading code reuse in the destination?s coverage area.  Then, source can send data to its neighbor on data channel with the reserved spreading code.  Data rate is in inverse proportion to the length of the spreading code.  The length of spreading code can ________________________________     be adjusted according to the interference, so the data rate in our scheme is adaptive.  Moreover, with the help of spreading code, our scheme can avoid the interference of hidden terminals.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows.  Section II reviews some existing MAC protocols.  Section III proposes our scheme.  Section IV provides the performance analysis models.  Section V conducts performance evaluations and comparisons.  Finally, Section VI concludes the paper.

2 Review of Some MAC Protocoals Many MACs have been proposed for multi-channel distributed networks.  In [1], common control channel (CCC) protocol was proposed for IEEE 802.11s mesh networks [3].  This defines a flexible medium access coordination architecture that works with arbitrary mixtures of devices that have one, one-and-a-half and several radios per node and accessing different numbers of channels.  CCC tries to make use of IEEE 802.11e enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) mechanism to provide prioritized contention-based multi-channel access.  In CCC, wireless medium is divided into a control channel (CC) and several mesh traffic (MT) channels by frequency.  CCC has some drawbacks.  Firstly, this protocol cannot remove the hidden terminal and it exposes terminal problems entirely.  When there is only one radio, CCC will have the hidden terminal problem mentioned in [4].

Request-to-send (RTS) and clear-to-send (CTS) are used for contention access in CCC.  Since RTS-CTS handshake cannot entirely remove hidden terminal problem [5], CCC still has hidden terminal problem.

Since the data channels are divided with frequency, CCC can not adaptively allocate bandwidth for different links.  In CCC, contention windows are embedded between data channels, which increases the contentions within the contention window and reduces the throughput of the system.

Receiver Initiated Channel-Hopping with Dual Polling [6] takes a similar approach, but the receiver initiates the collision avoidance handshake instead of the sender.  In [6], the system also need be synchronized.

[7] proposed a multi-channel with signal power based channel selection scheme.  In this scheme, data packet is transmitted when there is an idle channel.

3  The Proposed Scheme The main goal of our scheme is to reduce the channel access delay and increase the system?s throughput.  As is shown in Figure 1, our scheme has a control channel and a data channel which are divided by frequency.

The data channel is divided into data sub-channels with spreading codes.  One spreading code corresponds to one data sub-channel.  We use the sub-channel for short instead of data sub-channel in the following.  RTS-CTS handshake is used on the control channel.  The process of RTS-CTS handshake is designed as follows:   Figure 1. DCF of the proposed scheme   1) Node A sends RTS to node B for data  transmission on a sub-channel.  CSMA/CA is used as the medium access control scheme.

2) When node B receives RTS from node A, it sends CTS to node A after a short time interval, named short-inter-frame-space (SIFS).

3) If the sub-channel in Step 1 isn?t occupied, node A will send data to node B immediately on the sub-channel.  Otherwise, the data will be arranged for transmission on the sub-channel.

In our scheme, both RTS and CTS massages are of the same form which is composed of source ID, destination ID, spreading code ID, and duration.

Source ID is the ID of the node which sends the message; destination ID is the ID of the node which receives the message; and spreading code ID is the ID of the selected spreading code for transmission.

Duration is the length of time will be spent for the data transmission and is estimated according to the amount of data, the length of the spreading code, and the data rate of the system.  In the data channel, data packet and ACK are transmitted.

Data channel reservation is proposed in our scheme.

In IEEE 802.11 MAC, DCF was proposed for single channel system.  Data, ACK, RTS and CTS are sent on the same channel.  Data is transmitted immediately after a successful RTS-CTS handshake.   In our scheme, RTS and CTS are transmitted in control channel; data and ACK are transmitted in data channel.

Data shall not be transmitted immediately after a successful RTS-CTS handshake as in Step 3.  When there is no idle subchannel, RTS-CTS handshake can still be done on control channel.  After a successful RTS-CTS handshake, data is arranged for transmission on a subchannel.  When the time for transmission comes, the data will be transmitted immediately.  In this process, data channel reservation is needed for the arrangement.  It is realized with    virtual carrier sensing, which was proposed in IEEE 802.11 MAC, and is realized with networks allocation vector (NAV).  In our scheme, NAV records the start time and the duration of an arranged traffic on the subchannel based on duration information in RTS/CTS message.  When a node receives RTS/CTS with destination ID which is different from its own ID, it need conduct virtual carrier sensing.  The virtual carrier sensing acts differently in the following three conditions: 1) A node receives RTS/CTS when it is idle.  The  start time of NAV is the current time.  Duration of NAV is that in RTS/CTS.  The node does NAV immediately.

2) A node receives RTS/CTS when it is doing NAV and the remaining duration is tn.  The node needs to substitute the tn with the duration in RTS/CTS.

The start time of NAV is the current time.

3) A node receives RTS/CTS when it is sending data, and the remaining transmission time is td.  The start time of NAV is the sum of current time and td.  Let t be the duration in TRS/CTS.  The duration of NAV is t minus td.  When this node finishes the transmission, it starts doing NAV.

4  Performance Analysis Models  4.1  Throughput with Hidden Terminals  4.1.1 Throuput without hidden termianls Let N be the number of channels.  Each channel i, 1?i?N, is assigned an n bit pseudo-random noise (PN) sequence.  From [8], we can get the sum capacity of the CDMA channels in binary input Gaussian condition is:  ? ?/ 2 2log 2 ( ) log ( )b c NC e P y P y dyn ? ?  ?? ? ? ?   (1)  in which ? ?1 1( ) ( ) ( ) / 2P y P y P y??  and 2( ) exp ( / ) / 2 / 2mP y y m n N ? ?? ? ??  This capacity is denoted with bits/chip.  Let rd be the chip rate of the data channel.  Then we can get the capacity Cd denoted with bit/s.

/d b s dC C r?  ? ?2 2log 2 ( ) log ( )dNr e P y P y dyn ? ?  ?? ? ? ?         (2)  Let B be the bandwidth of the WMN.  In our scheme, B is composed of two parts: control channel and data channel.  The bandwidth of the control channel is BC.

Then the bandwidth of the data channel is BD= B?BC.

According to Shannon formula, the capacity of WMN is:   log 1 EC B n B  ? ? ? 	? ?  ? ? (3)  in which E is the signal power.  Let E(P) be the average length of the data packet.  Since packet rate  equals bit rate dividing by average packet length, the capacity of WMN denoted with packet rate is:  E( )WMN bits per second CP  packet length P ? ?  ? ? ?  (4)  According to Shannon formula, the capacity of data channel rDHMA of our scheme is:   log 1DHMA D D  Er B n B  ? ? ? 	? ?  ? ? (5)  in which E, n0 and BD have been defined in the upper parts.

Replacing rd in (2) with rDHMA in (5), we can get the sum capacity of the sub-channels:  ? ?2 2log 2 ( ) log ( )DHMADHMA NrC e P y P y dyn ? ?  ?? ? ? ?  (6) in which N is the number of sub-channels and n is the length of the spreading code.  Sum capacity of the sub-channels is the capacity of the data channel with CDMA access scheme, and the sum capacity of the sub-channels is named achievable data rate of the data channel.

The achievable packet rate of the data channel is the ratio of the achievable data rate of the data channel CDHMA to the average data packet length E[P].  Then the achievable packet rate of the data channel is:  E( ) DHMA  DHMA CP  P ?                                  (7)  According to Shannon formula, the capacity of control channel rCC in our scheme is:   log 1CC C C  Er B n B  ? ? ? 	? ?  ? ? (8)  in which E, n0 and BC have been defined in the upper parts.

Let E(RTSCTS) be the average cycle of a success RTS-CTS two-way handshake.  From [5], we can get E(RTSCTS) as follows: E( ) RTS CTSRTSCTS T SIFS T DIFS? ?? 	 	 	 	 	  (9) in which TRTS and TCTS are the transmission time of RTS and CTS, and they are equal to TRTS=RTS/rCC, TRTS=CTS/rCC.  RTS and CTS are the frame length of the RTS and CTS.  SIFS is short inter-frame space, and DIFS is DCF inter-frame space.  ? is propagation delay.

Then, the capacity of the control channel denoted with packet rate is the inverse of average cycle of a success RTS-CTS handshake, that is:  E( )  DHMA CCP RTSCTS  ?                         (10)  From [2], we can get the throughput of CSMA/CA on control channel under the offered load G:  (1-2 )+  aG  DHMA aG  GeS G a Ge  ?  ??                   (11)  in which a is normalized propagation delay of the radio.

Since throughput can be denoted with the ratio of achievable packet rate to channel capacity [5], achievable packet rate can be denoted with the product of throughput and channel capacity.  From (10) and (11), we can get the achievable packet rate of control channel under the offered load G:  DHMA DHMA CC CC DHMAR P S?                          (12)  Let LDHMA be the achievable packet rate on data channel of DHMA under offered load G.  In our system, every transmission of a data packet on data channel needs a success of RTS-CTS handshake on control channel.  Therefore, LDHMA is equal to the achievable packet rate on control channel when the achievable packet rate on control channel is smaller than the achievable packet rate on data channel.  When the achievable packet rate on control channel is higher than the achievable packet rate on the data channels, the data channels are full loaded, and LDHMA is equal to the achievable packet rate on data channel.  Then, LDHMA is as follows:  DHMA DHMA CC CC DHMA  DHMA DHMA DHMA CC DHMA  R R P L  P R P ? ??? ?  ??? (13)  The throughput of our scheme under offered load G is the ratio of LDHMA to the capacity of the WMN PWMN.

From (4) and (13), we can get the throughput of our scheme under the offered load G:  DHMA DHMA  WMN  LT P  ?                         (14)  Similar to (14), we can get the throughput of CCC under the offered load G:  '  '  '  '  ( ) ( ) / / (1 2 )  aG  aG A  CCC WMN  G e E RTSCTS E p r N G a eT  P  ?  ?	 ? ?  (15) In (15), G?={[E(RTSCTS)+ E(P)/rA/ N]*G}/E(RTSCTS)     (16)  4.1.2 Thoughput with hidden terminals Supposing all the nodes are uniformly distributed in the networks, we estimated the throughput of our system and CCC.  The capture area of node i is circle denoted with Ii.  cij is the capture distance of node i, and is the radius of the capture areas of node i.  cij can be denoted with cij=?dij.  ? is the capture factor and 1??.  dij is the distance from node i to node j.

Coverage area of node i is the maximum communication area of node i, and is denoted with Ci.

Let Hi be the aggregate of node i?s hidden terminals.

Let C(i,j) be the aggregate of the communication pair (m,n), and i j im C C H? ? ? , i j jn C C H? ? ? .  Suppose the data transmitted from node i to node j follow Poisson distribution.  Then, the length of the data?s inter-arrival time follows exponential distribution, and the average of the inter-arrival time is denoted with G(i,j).  Let Oi be the aggregate of hidden terminals during the transmission from node i to node j with RTS-CTS handshake scheme.  Oi is as follows:  i i j i jO I I I C? ? ? ?                        (17)  Let ? be the propagation delay from node i to node j, and TRTS be the transmission time of RTS.

From [5], we can get the success probability of a transmission from node i to node j in hidden terminal condition as follows:  ( , ) ( , ) , ( , ) ( , ) exp ( , ) ( , )  i  S RTS m n C i j m O n C m n  P i j G m n T G m n? ? ? ?  ? ?? ?? ? ?? ? ?? !

" " (18)  In our scheme, suppose the spreading code is m-sequence.  Then, we can get the autocorrelation ?(?) of the spreading code from [9].

? ?1 1/  ( ) 1/  C C  C  N T  T N T  # #  $ # #  ? ? ??? ?  ? ??  (19)  in which  ? is the delay offset of spreading code, TC is the chip duration of the spreading code, and n is the length of the spreading code.  Since the medium accesses of two nodes are independent, the delay offset ? is uniformly distributed on [0, nTC].  The expectation of ?(?) is E(?(?))=3(n-1)/(2n2).  Suppose the radio signal is transmitted in free space.  From [9], we can get the path loss:   2 2(4 ) t r  L G G  P d %  ? ?                               (20)  in which Gt and Gr are the antenna gain of transmitter and receiver respectively.  ? is the wave length of the radio, and d is the distance from transmitter to receiver.

In CSMA/CA, there is a power sensing threshold of the capture area.  Nodes with sensed power lower than the power sensing threshold take the channel as busy; otherwise take the channel as idle.  From (20), we can denote the power sensing threshold   CCCP  of CCC as follows:  ? ?0  22(4 ) CCC t r  CCC ij  G G P P  c  %  ? ?                    (21)  in which CCCijc is the capture distance of CCC, and P is the transmission power.  Since spreading code is used in our scheme, the power sensing threshold   DHMAP of DHMA is the product of sensed power and the average autocorrelation of the spreading code.  So,   DHMAP  is as follows:   ? ?0   ( ( ))  (4 ) DHMA t r  DHMA ij  G G P P E  c  % $ #  ?  ? ? ? ?? ? ? ? ?      ? ?  2 22  3( 1) 2(4 )  t r  DHMA ij  G G n P nc  %  ?  ? ?            (22)  in which DHMAijc is the capture distance of DHMA, and P is the transmission power.  Supposing the power sensing threshold of CCC and DHMA is equal, from (21) and (22), we can get the ratio ?C of capture distances of CCC and our scheme.

3( 1) / 2  CCC ij  C DHMA ij  c n c n  & ? ? ?  (23)  From (23), it can be seen that ?C>1, which indicates that the capture distance of CCC is longer than that of our scheme.  Since the longer of capture distance, the heavier of hidden terminal interference, our scheme has small hidden terminal interference.  Moreover, ?C is in direct ratio with n.  When the length of spreading code is increased, ?C is increased.  Supposing the capture distance of CCC is constant, we can see that the capture distance of our scheme is decreased when the length of spreading code is increased.  So, the hidden terminal interference in CCC is heavier than that in our scheme, and the hidden terminal interference in our scheme can be removed when the spreading code is long enough.

Suppose node i?s coverage areas in our scheme and CCC are equal, and they are denoted with Ci.  C(i,j) is the aggregate of the communication pair (m,n) and  i j im C C H? ? ? , i j jn C C H? ? ? .  Therefore, C(i,j) in our scheme and CCC are same.  Suppose the transmission power of every node in our scheme and CCC is equal.

From (23), it can be seen that node i?s capture areas in our scheme and CCC are different, and they are denoted with DHMAiI  and  CCC iI respectively.  From (17),  we can get Oi of our scheme and CCC: DHMA DHMA DHMA DHMA i i j i jO I I I C? ? ? ?       (24)  CCC CCC CCC CCC i i j i jO I I I C? ? ? ?             (25)  Let ( , )DHMASP i j  and ( , ) CCC  SP i j be the success transmission probability of our scheme and CCC respectively.  From (18), we can get ( , )DHMASP i j  and  ( , )CCCSP i j :  ( , ) ( , ) , ( , )  ( , ) exp ( , ) ( , ) DHMA i  DHMA S RTS  m n C i j m O n C m n  P i j G m n T G m n? ? ? ?  ? ?? ?? ? ?? ? ?? !

" "  (27) in which TRTS and TCTS are the same with that in (9).

The throughputs of our scheme and CCC with hidden terminals are the product of throughput without hidden terminals and the transmission success probability with hidden terminals, and they are as follows:  ( , )DHMA DHMAH DHMA ST T P i j?                       (28) ( , )CCC CCCH CCC ST T P i j?                             (29)  4.2  Access Delay Access delay is the length of time from a node sending RTS to this node starting to send data.  Access delay DA is the sum of contention access delay DCA and data channel waiting delay DW, that is,  DA= DCA+ DW                                   (30) Contention access delay is the length of time from a node sending RTS to this node receiving CTS.  Data channel waiting delay is the length of time from a node receiving the CTS to this node starting to send data.

In our scheme, RTS-CTS handshake is used on the control channel, so the collision happens only at RTS period.  Since CSMA/CA is used during RTS, according to [2], we can get the average contention access delay on control channel:  ( / 1)(1 2 ) 1DHMACA DHMAD G S a a' ?? ? 	 	 	 	 	    (31) in which G is the offered load for the WMN, SDHMA is the throughput of the control channel defined in (11), a is the propagation delay normalized by the transmission time of RTS TRTS, ? is the ratio of frame length of CTS to that of RTS, and ? is ratio of the average length of backoff time E[B] to the transmission time of RTS.  From [10], we can get the average length of backoff time E[B]=(E[CW]-a* TRTS)/2.  Here, a* TRTS is the propagation delay.  Then, ?= E[B]/ TRTS.

When the RTS-CTS handshake is succeeded, transmission of a data packet will be arranged on the data channels.  This process can be modeled as an M/M/1 queuing process.  The average packet arriving rate of the queue is DHMACCR defined in (12), and the average packet serving rate is the product of the throughput of DHMA and the capacity of WMN system, that is, DHMA DHMAH H WMNP T P? .  Then, the average waiting delay DW is the average waiting delay in the queue.  According to Little formula, we can get the average waiting time:  ( )  DHMA DHMA CC  W DHMA DHMA DHMA H H CC  R D  P P R ?  ? (32)  Replacing DCA and DW in (32) with DHMACAD  and DHMA  WD , we can get the access delay of our scheme: DHMA DHMA DHMA A CA WD D D? 	                        (33)  Similarly, we can get the throughput of CCC under the offered load G:    ' '  '( 1)(1 2 ) 1 '  '(1-2 )+  CCC A aG  aG  GD a a G e  G a e  ' ?? ?  ? ?  (34)  5  System Evaluations and Comparisons Table 1 offers the required parameters of our system and CCC during the evaluation. Suppose the nodes are uniformly distributed.  C(i,j) is {(b,i), (d,i), (d,j), (e,i), (e,j), (j,g)}.  From (23), it can be seen that the capture distance of our scheme is smaller than that of CCC.

When n=100, the ratio of the two capture distances ?C is 8.2.  Therefore, CCCijc  is much larger than  DHMA ijc .

Since CCCijc and DHMA ijc are the radiuses of  CCC iI  and DHMAiI , CCC iI is larger than  DHMA iI .  From (24) and  (25), we can see that CCCiO  is larger than DHMA iO .

Firstly, the throughput of DHMA is estimated.  From (14), we can get the throughput of DHMA without hidden terminals.  The estimation results are shown in    Figure 2.  When the offered load is increased, the throughput of DHMA is increased at first and decreased when the control channel is overloaded.

The estimation curve for CCC without hidden terminals is similar to that of our scheme.  However, because the contentions on control channel of CCC are more serious than that of ours, the throughput of CCC is lower when the offered load is over 23.  When there are hidden terminals, the throughputs of our scheme and CCC are decreased.  Because of the hidden terminal immune property which is analyzed in (23), our scheme has smaller throughput reduction than CCC does.

Throughput vs. offered load of DHMA and  CCC.

Then, the access delay of DHMA is estimated.  The access delay of our scheme can be estimated with (33).

Figure 3 shows the estimation results which imply: when the offered load is bellow 20, the access delay increases slowly; when the offered load is over 60, the access delay increase quickly.  Comparing with CCC, the access delay of our scheme is shorter.  When the offered load is increased, the access delay of our scheme increases slower than that of CCC.  The reason is that the contention window of our scheme can be arranged at any place on the control channel while that of CCC must be arranged between the two data transmissions.  So, when the offered loads in DHMA and CCC are equal, there are fewer RTSs within each contention window in our scheme than those in CCC.

6  Conclusions In this paper, we proposed a medium access scheme for multi-channel WMN.  Our scheme is designed to reduce the channel access delay and increase the system?s throughput.  Since CDMA is used to divide sub-channels on data channel, data-rate on each  sub-channel can be adjusted by changing the length of spreading code.  Because the transmissions between different communication pairs aren?t synchronized, hidden terminal interference can be reduced.  From the theory analyses and performance evaluations, we can see that our scheme has high throughput and short access delay and outperforms CCC.
