I.  INTRODUCTION  The airborne Opto-Electronic stabilizing platform, which is the carrier of the aerocamera, assures the visual axle stability of the aerocamera in the operation. The control precision of the Opto-Electronic stabilizing platform directly influences the imaging quality of the aerocamera.

Therefore, the design level of the servo system of the photoelectric stabilizing platform is vital to the aero- imaging system. The system identification of the Opto- Electronic stabilizing platform are the premises and basis for its design and analysis.

In the traditional identification method[1] [2], it is often required that the identified system shall not contain noises or only contain the noises with some known statistic characteristics and the actual system is often complex and there are various uncertain factors. Therefore, such restricting conditions are usually regarded as harsh and even difficult to be realized in the actual engineering design. In recent years, the artificial neural network gradually and widely applied in all the fields[4] has also played the more and more important roles in the system identification field.

Because the artificial neural network has the self- organizing, self-learning and self-adapting capability of inference, does not only depend on a formula and is good at refining the essential law of the system from the complex  data, it has the low requirements for the frequency domain specifications and statistical characteristics of the noises of the system. However, the BP network and Hopfield network widely developed and applied[5] in the system identification field are the nonlinear networks and the system characteristics that they identify are hidden in the topology and weight value of the network and represented in the form of neural network. In the traditional classical control theory, they are very difficult to be applied. Therefore, an identification model based on the transfer function and the ADALINE self-adapting linear neurons in the neural network are used for identification. Because the ADALINE network is the single linear neuron, with the simple topology, the weigh values obtained from the final convergence of the network are all the parameters of the transfer function to be identified so that the transfer function of the system can be directly obtained.

In the common servo system, the correcting design of the system can be made when the transfer function of the system is available. After the correction, the whole design shall not meet the design requirements until it is tested. At present, the method widely applied in the frequency domain is to directly measure the opened-loop frequency characteristic curve of the system[6], but it is often difficult to measure the opened-loop frequency characteristic curves of some systems. This is because the opened-loop increment of the system is often low and it is uneasy to directly measure their frequency characteristics. For example, in the speed loop test of the photoelectric stabilizing platform with the gyro as the sensor, it is characterized as high speed rate and long sine input and output periods in the low-frequency section and the limiting position is often reached when a sine period is not available, so it is difficult to measure. At the same time, after the system design, the opened-loop increment is often higher or even far more than the measuring ranges of the sensor and A/D convertor in order to assure the control precision of the system at this time, so it is more difficult to directly measure. Therefore, a method of first measuring the closed-loop frequency characteristics and then obtaining the opened-loop frequency characteristics[7] according to the closed-loop frequency characteristics is presented in the paper, which effectively     resolves the above problems, with the high practical engineering value.



II. SYSTEM IDENTIFICATION BASED ON THE ADALINE NEURAL NETWORK  A. Brief Introduction of the ADALINE Neural Network and its Learning Algorithm  ADALINE was presented by Professor Widrow of the US Stanford University in 1962. It is a self-adapting adjustable network. Its topology is shown in Figure 1:  Fig. 1: Topology of ADALINE  In the figure, n-dimension vector X is the input of ADALINE, n-dimension vector W is the weigh value to be adjusted, the LMS learning algorithm is used to adjust the weigh value and the transfer function is the linear function.

The learning mode of ADALINE is the supervised learning, that is, the output y time and the expected output t of the network are compared, the error ? = t ? y is sent to the LMS algorithm and the weigh value vector W is continuously adjusted online to make the output y approach the target t as possible as it can. It shall be said that the whole learning process of ADALINE is the process of making ? reduced and continuously adjusting the weigh value vector W in the rules of the learning algorithm. When ? is small enough finally, W is converged.

The weigh value adjusting algorithm based on the LMS learning rules is as follows:  W=?( t ? WX ) XT                                                                  (1) Whereas, ? is the learning rate, X is the n-dimension  input vector, W is the n-dimension weigh value and t is the expected output. Because the transfer function of ADALINE is the unit linear function, the above formula can be changed to  W=?( t ? y ) XT = ? ? XT                                                           (2) It is divided by the square of the length ||X|| of the vector X and becomes  W=( ? / ||X||2 ) ? XT                                                                       (3) Whereas,       ?= t ? y = t ? WX                                      (4)  According to the formula(4), there is ?= t ? WX = t ? WX                             (5) Because t is a constant at any sampling time, t is zero and there is  ?= ? WX                                                               (6) Substitute(3)  into the formula(6), there is  ?= ? WX= ???                                                      (7) It can be seen from the formula(7): because the  learning rate ? is a positive number, ? is always reverse to ? in the LMS algorithm, that is, the absolute value of ? is always montonically decreased and finally tends to be zero, making the network output y always continuously approach the expected output t in the training process.

B. Structural Design of the ADALINE Network  In the design of the velocity loop system of the airborne gyro stabilizing platform, the transfer function of the control object is usually defined as a second-order system:  )1)(1/()( 21 ++= sTsTKsG                          (8) In such a transfer function, the three functions, that is,  T1, T2 and K shall be identified. From the formula (8), there is: )/1/()/1/()( 21 TsrTsrsG +?+=               (9) Whereas, the Z transforming discrimination of r =K T1T2/( T1?T2) is made to obtain:  )1/()1/()( 12  ?? +?+= ztrztrzG  (10) Whereas, )/exp( 11 TTt s= , )/exp( 22 TTt s=  212 tta ?= )( 121 ttrb ?=  , )( 211 tta +?= Ts  is the saming period. Therefore, the difference equation model of the system is available: )2()1()1()( 211 ?+?+?= kyakyakbky (11) From the formula  (11), it can be seen that the input of the system completely depends on the previous input and the previous two inputs of the system in such a model.

Therefore, the ADALINE structure is available and shown in Figure 2:  Fig. 2: Structural Design of ADALINE in the System Identification  ADALINE continuously adjusts the weigh value vector according to the difference ? of the output y of the network and the actual output y(k) of the turntable and the LMS learning rules. When ? is small enough, the weigh value of the self-adapting neuron is converged, that is, the coefficient of the difference equation available.

C .  Training Design of the ADALINE Network  The fundamental purpose of the learning training of the neural network is to generalize the intrinsic and most essential law contained from a great number of samples with     noises, so it has the generalization capability and it is not to learn the individuality of each sample. The generalization capability refers to that the network has the ideal output of not only the data attending the training but also the data not attending the training. It shall be said whether there is the generalization capability is the most essential symbol for a network to be successfully trained. A network without generalization capability is a rigid network. It has no essential difference from the algorithm based on determining the formula in a traditional sense. Even if the network output y is able to approach the expected output t at any precision, it is nonsense because it has no most essential law and only the simple simulation and even vividly simulates the noises contained in t. In order to make the network have the good generalization capability and become a network that is really able to carry out autonomous learning with the vital force and the training design of the network is vital. First, the training times and the training expected error indexes shall be appropriately set. If the indexes are too low, the network will not be fully converged and if they are too high, the ?over fitting? problem may occur, that is, many inessential things in the training are learnt, that is, the so-called ?overt rained?. In the training, the design of the input vector and expected output vector of the network are also vital. In the paper, the step response of the system is chosen as the expected output of the network, the standard step signal and the step response of the system at the previous two times are chosen as the input vectors of the network. Because of the disturbance of the random noises and the nonlinear and uneven friction moment, the step response available each time is not the same. In order to make the network eliminate the disturbance of the noises and friction moment as possible as it can and obtain the essential law of the system, the n-step response shall be regarded as the expected output as much as possible.

However, in the experiment of the XX1 turntable, it is found that the network has had the good generalization capability when n is more than or equal to 3; therefore, the network input )1( ?kx  consisting of 3 standard step signals and the expected output )(ky consisting of three step responses shown in Figure 3 are finally determined and the other 2- dimension input vectors are the previous two outputs )1( ?ky and )2( ?ky of )(ky .

Samples Fig. 3: Input and Expected Output of ADALINE  D.Results and Conclusion of the Experiment  The set input data and expected data are input to the network to obtain the following network training error curve:  0        10       20        30       40       50        60  Training epoch  Fig. 4: Training Curve of ADALINE  3 same convergence weigh values are available in the final convergence of the network: From(10), there is  )3553.01/(002.0)9955.01/(002.0)( 11 ?? ???= zzzG (12)  Because the sampling period is 0.00125s, there is the following when the Laplace transformation of the formula (12) is made:  )10012.0)(12778.0/(4326.0)( ++= sssG                   (13) Finally, the formula (13)  is the transfer function identified.

In the mat lab, the simulation step response of the formula (13) is made and compared with the step response (shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6) of the true photoelectric stabilizing platform. It is found that the step response of the transfer function of the system identified is not only basically consistent with the step response data of the system attending the network training but also highly similar to the step response data of the system of the platform not attending the network training, which indicates that the designed network has the good generalization capability.

When the ADALINE network is finally converged, the following pulse response function of the system is available:  )09565.01)(9651.01/(00165.0)( 11 ?? +?= zzzG (14) Because the system has a pair of climaxes with contrary signs and cannot be directly transformed to the continuous transfer function by the impact response invariance, it can only be transformed to the Laplace domain by the double- linear transformation method: G(s)=( ?1.19 10-7s2+0.3046)/(0.0352s+1)(0.00052s+1) (15) It can be seen the transfer function identified by the neural network has 1 quadratic term in the numerator more than the expected standard transfer function model when the system is disturbed by the big moment and contains the serious noises, but such a quadratic term system is very small and far less than the two inertia time constants of the system, so it can be eliminated in the engineering. Therefore, the approximate transfer function of the system is available:  )100052.0)(10352.0/(3046.0)( ++= sssG (16)  It can be seen from Figure 7 that the ADALINE neural network can still accurately identify the transfer function of the system when the system is greatly disturbed with the big noises and the SNR is 7.8db. Therefore, the following conclusion can be made: when the disturbance moment and noises acting on the system are small, ADALINE can directly obtain the transfer function of the system; when the system has the big disturbance moment and noises, its step output signal has been seriously distorted and shown some nonlinear characteristics and the transfer function identified by ADALINE can still accurately represent the linear characteristics of the system after the simple approximate treatment. Compared with the traditional identification method based on determining the formula, there is no requirement for the frequency domain characteristics and statistical characteristics of the noises in the signal in the intelligent learning identification method based on the neural network. In the meanwhile, there is no special requirement for the input trigger signal of the system. It can be either the step input mentioned in the paper or sine input or other inputs.

III. ANALYSIS OF FREQUENCY CHARACTERISTICS  Closed-loop frequency characteristics of the system ))(1/()()( jwGjwGjwG ooc +=                             (17)  Therefore, the opened-loop frequency characteristics of the system are available:  ))(1/()()( jwGjwGjwG cco ?=                              (18)  It is assumed that the closed-loop frequency characteristics of the system shall be  ccc jBAjHHjwG +=+= ?? sincos)(                (19)  it is available from the formula (18): )1/()()( cccco jBAjBAjwG ??+=  so )21/())(()( 2222 ccccccco BAAjBBAAjwG ++?++?=          (20)  A m  pl itu  de   A m  pl itu  de   A m  pl itu  de      From the formula 20 , the actual frequency characteristic A and virtual frequency characteristic B of the opened-loop frequency characteristics are available: )21/())(( 2222 cccccc BAABAAA ++?+?=        (21)  )21/( 22 cccc BAABB ++?=                                    (22)  Therefore, the opened-loop amplitude frequency characteristic H and phase frequency characteristic ?  of the system are finally available:  22 BAH +=                                                        (23)  )/(tan 1 AB?=?                                                      (24) Therefore, it is very easy to obtain the opened-loop  frequency characteristic curve shown in the figure below according to the closed-loop frequency characteristic curve after the correction of the XX2 turntable:    100.5         101                101.5            102               102.5           103  Frequency (ran/s) Fig. 8 Opened-loop Frequency Characteristic Curve Obtained from  the Closed-loop Frequency Characteristic Data  According to the transfer function )100052.0)(10352.0/(3046.0)( ++= sssG  identified in  the previous section and the analysis of the designed correcting link )11.0/()1008.0(80)(1 ++= sssG , there shall exist three turnover frequencies of the system in the frequency range of 1-1000rad/s:  sradTw /4.28/1 11 == , sradTw /10/12 == and sradw /125/13 == ? . It can be clearly seen from  Figure 8 that the frequency characteristic curve has the obvious turnover transformation in the above three frequency points, which is basically consistent with the identification results made in the previous time. One of the important points of using the closed-loop frequency characteristics to obtain the opened-loop frequency characteristic curve lies in inspection of the correction of the system via the curve. In the figure, the ?  value, the differential time constant in the correcting link of the system can be seen and causes the system to nearly pass the horizontal axle nearly at the critical slop of -20db, with the poor stability. In the meanwhile, it can be seen that the resonance frequency of the system is about 400rad/s, that is  to say, the band width of the system can only be about 400rad/s at maximum.

.  CONCLUSION AND PROSPECT  In the paper, a time domain system identification method based on the ADALINE self-adapting neurons is presented, the structural design and training design of ADALINE are introduced in details and then the experimental results are given according to the design requirements of the airborne photoelectric stabilizing platform servo system. In the design, training and operation of the ADALINE neurons, it can be seen that such a time domain identification method based on the ADALINE self- adapting neurons cannot depend on the noise model of the system to carry out the effective identification and the network trained well has the good generalization capability.

Only the second-order system of the airborne photoelectric stabilizing velocity loop is taken for example in the paper.

In fact, because the ADALINE can have random inputs, the high-order system can be identified if only the module of the system model is determined in advance. In the meantime, a method that the closed-loop frequency characteristics of a system based on the correlation measurement method are measured first and then transformed to the opened-loop frequency characteristics is presented, with the high practical engineering value according to the difficulty of some systems in directly obtaining the opened-loop characteristics in the paper. The experimental results prove that the method presented in the paper can still effectively identify the model of the system on the premise of big noises and serious disturbance and meet the design requirements of the airborne photoelectric platform servo system.
