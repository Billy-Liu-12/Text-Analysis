Managing Uncertainty in Spatial and Spatio-temporal Data

Abstract?Location-related data has a tremendous impact in many applications of high societal relevance and its growing volume from heterogeneous sources is one true example of a Big Data [1]. An inherent property of any spatio-temporal dataset is uncertainty due to various sources of imprecision. This tutorial provides a comprehensive overview of the different challenges involved in managing uncertain spatial and spatio-temporal data and presents state-of-the-art techniques for addressing them.



I. INTRODUCTION  Current technology trends such as smart phones, general mobile devices, stationary sensors and satellites coupled with a new user mentality of utilizing this technology to vol- untarily share information generate a huge volume of geo- spatial and geo-spatio-temporal data. This data flood provides a tremendous potential of discovering new and possibly useful knowledge. In addition to the fact that measurements are imprecise, the physical limitation of devices also requires some form of interpolation in-between discrete time instants. From a complementary perspective, to reduce the communication and bandwidth utilization, along with the storage requirements, often the data is subjected to a reduction, thereby eliminat- ing some of the known/recorded values. When it comes to Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), in addition to the sheer imprecision of determining locations at a given time-instant, uncertainty is also a consequence of: (1) insufficient coverage, and (2) the quest for energy-savings. All of these issues introduce the notion of uncertainty in the context of spatio- temporal data management - an aspect raising an imminent need for its scalable and flexible management.

The main objective of this tutorial is to present to the audience effective and efficient solutions to various problems related to management of uncertain spatial and spatio-temporal data, which have been published in the recent years. In a plethora of research fields and industrial applications, these techniques can substantially improve the quality of decision making, minimize risk and unearth valuable insights that would otherwise remain hidden. The challenge of effectiveness in uncertain data is to correctly determine the set of possible results, each associated with the correct probability of being  All? 2 	possible?worlds  Partitioning  Classes?of?Equivalent?

a result, in order to give a user a confidence about the returned results. The complementary challenge of efficiency is to enable fast computations for these results and corresponding probabilities, allowing for reasonable querying times, even for large uncertain databases.

The general problem of querying uncertain spatial data using the common Possible-Worlds model [2] is #P-hard in the number of database objects. Yet, it has been observed that special query types and data mining tasks may still have a polynomial-time solution. This tutorial identifies, formalizes and applies a general paradigm to facilitate the challenge of finding such solutions. As shown in Figure 1, in general it may be required to determine a PSPACE set of equivalent classes of possible worlds, such that members of the same class can be considered equivalent for a given query predicate.

Many existing works on managing uncertain spatial data apply this paradigm for the most prominent classes of probabilistic spatial and spatio-temporal queries on uncertain data, includ- ing range queries, k-nearest neighbor queries, ranking queries and reverse k-nearest neighbor queries. Based on this concept, novel spatial and probabilistic pruning approaches that have been developed recently will be discussed. In the second part     of this tutorial special emphasis is given to the temporal aspect of applications using modern data collection technologies.

While the aforementioned techniques work well for single points of time, the prediction of query results over time remains a challenge.

The main objectives of this tutorial are:  ? Provide a comprehensive overview of different research issues and solutions addressing various aspects of uncer- tainty in spatial and spatio-temporal data. This overview is aimed both at students with no prior experience in the field, as well as at attendants with some background.

? Present a comprehensive overview of models, algorithms, solutions and techniques in the field of managing uncer- tain spatial data, catering to a broad audience. Here, the aim is to teach the background necessary for attending sessions in the field of uncertain data management, in- creasing the attendance rate of such sessions at confer- ences such as ICDE.

? Teach common paradigms used to manage uncertainty, including techniques for sampling and Monte-Carlo based approaches, as well as a general paradigm for exact query processing using possible world semantics.

We are aware that several tutorials have been presented in the recent past [3], [4], [5], [6], touching some of the topics of this tutorial (some of them by the proposers). However, what separates this proposed tutorial are a number of novelties:  ? Many new topics are presented to the audience, including a tutorial on managing uncertain spatio-temporal data.

? Its unique presentation style ? each expert will get a chance to inform the audience not only about the topics he deems relevant, but also in a manner that he perceives the main benefits of those topics and how he used them in his own research;  ? It will balance the breadth and the depth between bodies of works which, in many dimensions, are inter-related but have not been presented in a ?unified? tutorial.



II. TUTORIAL OUTLINE  We now outline the main themes addressed in the tutorial.

Motivation - Application Settings Living in a world of data-driven science, we will begin the  tutorial by introducing spatial and spatio-temporal data as well as modern sources of such data, such as GeoWeb 2.0 and Geo- Social data. Dr. Trajcevski will begin the tutorial by motivating the importance of managing and analyzing such data, giving spatial applications such as sensor monitoring [7], location- based services [8]; as well as spatio-temporal applications in- cluding RFID tracking [9] GPS tracking [10]. The importance of analyzing data that arises in such applications is set into the context of the vision of analyzing big data [1].

Spatial and Spatiotemporal Data Dr. Trajcevski will formally introduce spatial and spatio-  temporal data and give an overview over existing work that has been done on managing such data, ignoring uncertainty.

Given that techniques for spatial data are rather well-known by the community we present these briefly and will focus on representation, management and query processing of spatio- temporal data [11], [12], [13], [14].

Models for Uncertain Spatial Data: A formal categorization of models for uncertain spatial data will be provided by Dr. Emrich. He we will introduce discrete [15], [16] and continuous [17], [18], [19] models; attribute [20], [21], [22], [23], [24] and existential [25] uncertainty; probabilistic query predicates such as probabilistic threshold queries [17], [26], [27] (return all objects having a result probability greater some threshold) and probabilistic top-k queries [28] (return the k- set of objects having the highest result probability); as well as approximate [29] queries. He will also introduce the notion of probabilistic query answer semantics, including object based semantics [22], [26], [30] that return objects associated with probabilities to be part of the result of a query, as well as result-based semantics [31], that return result sets associated with probabilities to be the result of a query. The whole spectrum of components of a probabilistic query is shown in Figure 2. Furthermore, indexing techniques [32], [27], [33], [17], [34] for uncertain spatial data will be presented.

Possible World Semantics  Dr. Zu?fle will introduce the concept of possible world semantics, giving a mathematically sound and intuitive inter- pretation of uncertain spatial databases that is commonly used.

To tame the exponentially large number of possible worlds [2], [35], [36], [37] spanning an uncertain spatial database, two main approaches will be described in detail. These are Monte-Carlo approaches [29] and the Paradigm of Equivalent Worlds. Dr. Zu?fle will describe the later, yet unpublished, paradigm, depicted in Figure 1. This solution is implicitly used by all approaches answering queries in polynomial time using possible world semantics (e.g. [38]) to facilitate the search for efficient algorithms.

Zu?fle will show how both approaches, Monte-Carlo sampling and the Paradigm of Possible Worlds, are used to answer a wide range of queries on uncertain spatial data having discrete uncertainty models. Specifically he will show solutions for kNN queries [19], [27], [39]. Here, we will present a selec- tion of elegant techniques that have recently been published, including the Poisson-Binomial recurrence technique [19] and the generating functions technique [22]. Furthermore, state- of-the-art techniques used to manage probabilistic streams [40], [41], [28], [42], i.e., uncertain spatial objects that change their distribution frequently will be discussed. Dr. Zu?fle will proceed to present solutions for the case of objects having continuous models. He will show advanced solutions for the problem of reverse k-nearest neighbor search [43], [44], [26].

For this purpose, he will present techniques to approximate continuous density functions, using polynomial splines [45] and using a hierarchical partitioning scheme [27]. Based on this approximations, Dr. Zu?fle will show how to approximate the kNN probability of an object. Here, special emphasis will be given to stochastic distance correlation, i.e., that even if three objects A, B and C are mutually independent, the distances dist(A,C) and dist(B,C) may be correlated, as both these random variables depend on the common random variable C. Using the technique of uncertain generating func- tions [27], [45], a correct, effective and efficient solution to approximate kNNs will be presented.

Traditional Approaches for Uncertain Spatio-Temporal Data  With the integration of temporal aspects, the problem of handling uncertainty becomes even more challenging. Dr. Tra- jcevski will review traditional models to cope with these new challenges by bounding the possible locations of objects over time by spatio-temporal cylinders [46], [47], [48], diamonds [49] or beads [50], [51]. On top of these models, several query types have been proposed such as range queries [52], [47], [48] and kNN queries [46], [53]. Additionally, Goce will emphasise the problem of location dependency in older works on this topic [53], [46], [49], [54], [55] in order to motivate the use of more advanced models. State-of-the-art approaches for querying traffic network data will also be discussed.

Advanced Approaches for Uncertain Spatio-Temporal Data  Dr. Emrich will present recently developed models for uncertain spatio-temporal data where objects are described stochastic processes [9]. As a characteristic type of a stochastic process, the Markov model is introduced and its application to UST data is shown in [10]. Furthermore he will show how window queries [10], similarity queries [56] and kNN queries [57] can be solved using both proposed solution approaches (equivalent worlds vs. monte-carlo sampling). Finally, index structures for this model [58] will be presented. The tutorial concludes with an overview of open research challenges and future work.
