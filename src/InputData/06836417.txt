Atmospheric Entry Studies for Uranus  Parul Agrawal Gary A. Allen Jr. Evgeniy B. Sklyanskiy

Abstract- The present paper describes parametric studies conducted to define the Uranus entry trade  space. Two different arrival opportunities in 2029 and  2043, corresponding to launches in 202 1 and 2034,  respectively, are considered in the present study. These  two launch windows factor in the 84-year orbital period,  significant axial tilt, and the wide ring system of Uranus.

As part of this study, an improved engineering model is  developed for the Uranus atmosphere. This improved  model is based on reconciliation of data available in the  published literature and covers an altitude range of 0  km (1 bar pressure) to 5000 km. Two different entry  scenarios are considered: 1) direct ballistic entry, and 2)  aerocapture followed by entry from orbit. For ballistic  entry a range of entry flight path angles are considered  for probe entry masses ranging from 130 kg to 300 kg  and diameters ranging from 0.8 m (Pioneer-Venus small  probe scale) to 1.3 m (Galileo scale). The larger probes,  which offer a larger packing volume, are considered in  an attempt to accommodate more scientific instruments.

For aerocapture a single case is studied to explore the  feasibility and benefits of this option.
