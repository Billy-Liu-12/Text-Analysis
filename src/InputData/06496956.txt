Abstract?In this paper, a new least square data fusion  rule in multiple sensor distributed detection system is  proposed. In the proposed approach, the central  processor combines the sensors hard decisions through  least squares criterion to make the global hard decision  of the central processor. In contrast to the optimum  Neyman-Pearson fusion, where the distributed detection  system is optimized at the fusion center level or at the  sensors level, but not simultaneously, the proposed  approach achieves global optimization at both the fusion  center and at the distributed sensors levels. This is done  without knowing the error probabilities of each  individual distributed sensor. Thus the proposed least  squares fusion rule does not rely on any stability of the  noise environment and of the sensors false alarm and  detection probabilities. Therefore, the proposed least  squares fusion rule is robust and achieves better  global  performance. Furthermore, the proposed method can  easily be applied to any number of sensors and any type  of distributed observations. The performance of the  proposed least squares fusion rule is evaluated and  compared to the optimum Neyman-Pearson fusion rule.

The results show that the performance of the proposed  least squares fusion rule outperforms the performance of  the Neyman-Pearson fusion rule.
