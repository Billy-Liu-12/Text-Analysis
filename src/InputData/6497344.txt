Avionics of the Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) Microsat Constellation

Abstract? The Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS), which was recently selected as the Earth Venture- 2 investigation by NASA?s Earth Science System Pathfinder (ESSP) Program, measures the ocean surface wind field with unprecedented temporal resolution and spatial coverage, under all precipitating conditions, and over the full dynamic range of wind speeds experienced in a tropical cyclone (TC). The CYGNSS flight segment consists of 8 microsatellite-class ob- servatories, which represent SwRI?s first spacecraft bus design, installed on a Deployment Module for launch. They are identical in design but provide their own individual contribution to the CYGNSS science data set. Subsystems include the Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS), the Communica- tion and Data Subsystem (CDS), the Electrical Power Supply (EPS), and the Structure, Mechanisms, and Thermal Subsystem (SMT). This paper will present an overview of the mission and the avionics, including the ADCS, CDS, and EPS, in detail.

Specifically, we will detail how off-the-shelf components can be utilized to do ADCS and will highlight how SwRI?s existing avionics solutions will be adapted to meet the requirements and cost constraints of microsat applications. Avionics electronics provided by SwRI include a command and data handling com- puter, a transceiver radio, a low voltage power supply (LVPS), and a peak power tracker (PPT).
