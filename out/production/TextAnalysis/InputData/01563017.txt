A New Association Rule-Based

Abstract  This paper proposes a new association rule-based  text classifier algorithm to improve the prediction  accuracy of Association Rule-based Classifier By  Categories (ARC-BC) algorithm. Unlike the previous algorithms, the proposed association rule generation  algorithm constructs two types of frequent itemsets.

The first frequent itemsets, i.e. Lk, contain all term that  have no an overlap with other categories. The second  frequent itemsets, i.e. OLk, contain all features that have an overlap with other categories. In addition, this  paper also proposes a new join operation for the  second frequent itemsets. The experimental results are  shown a good performance of the proposed classifier  1. Introduction  Text categorization task is defined as assigning  category labels to new documents based on their  contents. Text categorization research has a long  history, starting in early 1960s. There are several text  categorization approaches have been proposed such as  neural networks, genetic algorithms and probabilistic  models, support vector machine.

Recently, Association Rule-based Classifier By  Categories (ARC-BC) [3, 4] algorithm is proposed to  build an associative text classifier. ARC-BC algorithm  considers each set of documents belonging to one  category as a separate text collection to generate  association rules. If a document belongs to more than  one category, this document will be present in each set  associated with the categories that the document falls  into. However, the algorithms may fail to classify a  single-class document that has some terms of  document mutually associated with other class.

Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new association  rule-based text classifier to deal with such problem.

This paper is organized as following. The second,  we introduce our new text categorization approach.

Experimental results are described in Section 3. We  summarize our research and future work in the forth  Section.

2. A New Association Rule-Based Text  Classifier Algorithm  Here, a new algorithm for association rule  generation and a new categorization algorithm based  on the new set of rules is proposed.

2.1. Association Rule Generation  Like typical apriori-based algorithms, our  associative rules are generated from frequent itemsets.

Therefore, frequent itemsets are constructed in order to  get the set of associative rules. However, unlike the  previous algorithms, our method constructs two types  of frequent itemsets. The first frequent itemsets, i.e. Lk,  contain all term that have no an overlap with other  categories. The second frequent itemsets, i.e. OLk,  contain all features that have an overlap with other  categories.

Basically, any frequent itemsets has to include a  category label starting from 2-itmesets to k-itemsets.

For the first frequent itemsets, Lk, is constructed using  apriori join. As an example, Lk is constructed by using  apriori join between Lk-1 and Lk-1. In this paper, a new  join operation for the second frequent itemsets, OLk, is  proposed.

For the new join operation, any two items in an  itemset can be joined if they have the same category.

The examples of both of apriori join and the new join  (ARTC join) are shown in figure 1 and figure2. In  addition, the algorithm, called ARTC, for generating  association rules are shown in figure 3.

ARTC algorithm In our algorithm, T set is generated from L0 and L1  using apriori join. L0 is a set of categories that satisfies  by support threshold and L1 is a set of terms that satisfy  by support threshold. Then, L2 is generated form T set.

Next, frequent itemsets starting from L3 to Lk are  generated by OLk-1 join ML. ML includes all itemsets  that have the same category in OLk .Figure 4 shows an  example of T, L2, OL2 and ML.

3. Experimental Results  For our experiment, we use Computer Science  Technical Report collection dataset (CSTR) to evaluate  our algorithm. CSTR data is the abstracts of URCS  technical reports published in the department of  computer science at the University of Rochester  between 1987 and 2005. The dataset contained 472  abstracts, which were divided into four research areas:  AI, Robotics and Vision, Systems and Theory.

Conclusion and Future work  In this paper, we introduce the new algorithm for  text categorization, Association Rule-Based Text  Classifier algorithm (ARTC). According to the  experimental results, ARTC algorithm shows good  performance in classifying the data. In the future, we  will further conduct experimentations on the other  datasets to evaluate the performance of the algorithm.
