A decisional tool for quality improvement in higher  education

Abstract? In the actual economical context, characterized by the competition pressures, the use of decisional tools become a valuable advantage to make the difference. The concepts of data warehouse, multidimensional model and data mining, are essentials in the design and the deployment of such tools. In this paper we describe the design and implementation of a decisional tool, dedicated to a no lucrative goal institution. Our case study is a university that hopes to improve the quality of his service, by analyzing the pedagogical results, to discover the success and failure factors, and attempt to increase success chances of students. In this perspective we use OLAP (Online Analytical Process) and association rules discovery techniques.

I.  INTRODUCTION The use of the decisional tools in enterprises, in the goal to  improve the operational and strategic decisions quality, has been largely generalized since 1990. In the actual economical context, characterized by the competition pressures, the use of these tools become a valuable advantage to make the difference. Since enterprises possess a large volume of data, probably in heterogeneous formats, dispatched in several databases, they need to deploy a decisional solution to exploit efficiently this data. The concept of data warehouse is essential in the deployment of such solution [1].

A data warehouse is a data collection, that is integrated, subject oriented, historised , summarized and available to interrogation and analysis [2]. The deployment of a data warehouse consists to extract data from production bases, organize them around subjects, and summarize them for decision aid [3].

This challenge necessitates an appropriated design process, and a data model witch is adapted to the decisional needs. So the multidimensional model seems the most fit to capture the characteristics of data warehouses. This model is based on tow concepts: facts and dimensions, which represent respectively the measures to be analyzed and the different axis of this analysis [4].

In the classical case of a lucrative goal enterprise, measures deal to profitableness objectives, so they have often a financial consonance (turnover, benefit, etc). However, some no  lucrative goals can be achieved with decisional tools, in institutions that do not evaluate their performance in terms of turnover, or benefits: the university is an interesting example of these institutions.

How to use decisional tools to improve the quality and the efficiency in higher education? What are available measures and relevant analysis dimensions in this context? What are success and failure factors for a student in a university syllabus?

In this paper we attempt to propose answers to these questions, by designing a decisional tool, to analyze pedagogical results in a university, using multidimensional analysis techniques, and data mining.

This paper is organized as fellows:  Section 2: discuss about the motivations of this work and some related works.

Section 3: describes our design process.

Section 4: describes the goals specification phase.

Section 5: discuss about analysis and enrichment of the information system.

Sections 6 and 7: present the design of the tow parts of our decisional tool.

Section 8: shows the architecture and some interfaces of the tool, and discuss about obtains results.

Section 9: summarizes the obtained results and future works.



II. MOTIVATIONS AND RELATED WORKS In front of the annual statement of pedagogical results  obtained by students in computer science department, of Houari Boumediene University of sciences and technologies, which are on this side of our ambitions, some questions merit consideration, about the success and failure factors. Although the success is the result of a complex formula, with many variables, we state that we can master some of these parameters to maximize students' efficiency. We can attempt to do that, by analyzing the available measures of the student-university    relationship according different axis, and using OLAP (Online Analytical Process) techniques [5][6].

In [7] we have proposed a decisional tool for distant tutors in an e-learning platform, with the same objectives. However the automated relationship between e-tutor and e-learner in such platform, provide a rich source of click stream information. In the actual case study the measurable information is limited (essentially marks obtained in examinations), that necessitate an additional effort in the multidimensional design to exploit at best this information.

A second part of our work consists to discover associations between marks obtained by students in different pedagogical modules. Our goal is to reveal abnormal week links, between pedagogical modules witch belong to the same family, to strengthen this links by improving the pedagogical contains.

We exploit the associative rules discovery techniques [8][9].



III. DESIGN PROCESS In the aim to design methodically our tool, we have adopted a goal oriented process design based on five steps. First we have proceeded to capture needs and specify the goals, by interviewing the principals? actors of the pedagogical process: teachers, students, studies manager?etc. Then we have analyzed the available information system to identify the exploitable data as decisional support. Some insufficiencies in this information system lead us to extend it, by integrating the missing decision-making data. Finally we have proceeded to the design of the multidimensional model and the data mining module. Figure 1 shows our process design.

IV. GOALS SPECIFICATION After discussion with different participants in the  pedagogical process, we have listed some analysis axis susceptible to influence positively or negatively in the pedagogical results. We have also identified the studies and pedagogy manager as the principal actor of our system. We can list some of analysis axis as follows:  ? Analysis of efficiency of each teacher in deal with the success ratio obtained by section and by module.

? Analysis of efficiency of each section in deal with the success ratio obtained, by teacher and by module.

? Analysis of the success ratio obtained in each module, and each examination.

? Analysis of the students' absence ratio impact on the success ratio.

? Analysis of social situation impact on the success ratio.

? Analysis of the association between marks obtained in different pedagogical modules.



V. INFORMATION SYSTEM ANALYSIS AND ENRICHMENT  After study of the information system available, we have notice some important insufficiencies in deal with a decisional exploitation, we can list:  ? No trace of partial examination results  ? No trace about students absence ratio  ? A lack of personal information about students (social situation, ?)  So, we have stated that some of our goals can not be achieved in the actual situation. However we have proposed an enrichment of the actual information system, to support the decisional requirements. Figure 2 shows the UML class diagram of the enriched information system.

VI. MULTIDIMENSIONAL DESIGN In this step we have proceed to the design of star schemes,  by identifying measures and dimensions. Measures are essentially provided by success and absence ratios. Dimensions correspond to the analysis axis of each measure.

The following figures (figure 3, figure 4, figure 5) are a sketch of our multidimensional model.

VII. DATA MINING  DESIGN The second component of our decisional tool is a data  mining module, which have as goal to discover the association between marks obtained by students in different pedagogical modules. More concretely, we hope to check if the presupposed associations between some modules are really effective in practice. For example "Information system" is considered as a prerequisite of "Data bases", so we have to check if students who have good marks in "Information system", have also good marks in "Data bases". This consists to discover rules such {if good mark in IS  good mark in DB} with a high trust degree.

In the opposite case, if this association is infirmed we suggest the creation of pedagogical committee, composed by teachers of the tow modules, to identify the causes of this anomaly, and eventually improve the contents of the courses, for facilitating the passage between the tow pedagogical modules.

We have used the association rules discovery techniques, especially A priori Algorithm [9].

This iterative algorithm begins by finding frequent 1- itemset, for example modules which are often acquired by the students. From this set, it can determine the frequent 2-itemsets that is the sets consisted of two modules frequently collectively acquired -because naturally so that two modules are collectively often acquired, each both has to be rather often allowed-. The algorithm continues until it finds no more k modules sets frequently collectively acquired.



VIII. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DECISIONAL TOOL Our decisional tool was developed with Delphi 7.0 under  the system Windows XP. The database was implemented with Oracle 9i.

A. General architecture of the solution The general architecture of our solution is characterized by  a data warehouse that integrates data from the production system and external documents. Decisional data are organized in data cubes for OLAP (Online Analytical Process) analysis.

We can also access to the associative rules discovered by the data mining module. Figure 6 shows this architecture.

Figure 6.  Architecture of the decisional tool  B. Interface of the tool We can describe functionally our tool by the UML  components diagram shown in figure 7.

Fixing the support of A priori algorithm  Figure 12.   Discovered associative rules of A priori algorithm  C. Tests and results The implemented tool has been tested on the Computer  Science Department database, and has permitted a useful analysis of available data.

The OLAP analysis module permits to explore the different analysis axis, and their influence in success or failure of students. So we can for example discover the tendency of a particular teacher to give bad or good marks. We can also verify the impact of the students? absences, on their results in exams.   The difficulties met by the students in certain modules with regard to the others, were also revealed by the tool.

The results obtained at this level, could be exploited by the direction of the studies to make decisions like:  ? Make sensitive the teachers to question their methods of evaluation.

? Increase the hourly volume of the modules the results of which are below the average.

? Make sensitive the administration for a more rigorous management of the absences of the students  The data mining module allowed bringing to light abnormally weak correlations between the results obtained in modules of the same family (data bases and information system, theory of the languages and compilation).

To mitigate these abnormalities, the implementation of inter-modular educational committees is recommended. These committees will group together teachers of these modules to compare the programs and the educational steps adopted, and to synchronize the contents and the methods of the educations.



IX. CONCLUSION In this paper, we are interested to design and  implementation of a decisional tool, dedicated to analysis of pedagogical results, for improvement of higher education quality. The first version of our tool permits the use of OLAP operators to analyse marks through different axis. It also provides a data mining module based on associative rules discovery, to check association between the marks obtained in different pedagogical modules.

We consider that this work contribute to propose answers to the questions relative to the factors of failure and success of the students. Although some of these factors -such as the social situation of the students- are not controllable, it is possible to act on the others so as to maximize the chances of success of the students.

Our tool can be to use as support of help to the decision- making, for the improvement of the quality of education in the university.

As perspective of our work, we suggest to extend the data mining module by exploiting other techniques of data mining such as neurones nets.
