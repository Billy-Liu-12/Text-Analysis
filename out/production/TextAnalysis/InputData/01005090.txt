A Rough Set Foundation for Spatial Data Mining Involving Vague Regions

Abstract - The RCC and egg-yolk methods have proven useful for representation of vague regions in spatial data. Here we model them using rough set theory. This then develops the hasis to allow a rough set approach to uncertainty in spatial relationships for association NI= and other forms of spatial data mining.

1. INTRODUCTION  Spatial databases and qualitative reasoning about spatial data are active areas of research encompassing artificial intelligence, databases and information systems, data mining, geometry, geography, and many more research fields. Results from research in spatial data and reasoning are especially useful in geographic information systems (CIS), spatial databases containing data that is geo-referenced to specific locations on the earth, along with mechanisms for reasoning about this spatial data. As with any system that attempts to model some aspects of the real world, there must be some mechanism for the management of uncertainty. Uncertainty management is particularly necessary in resolving a myriad ofproblems inherent in spatial information systems [I].

A spatial database is a collection of data conceming objects located in some reference space, which attempts to model some enterprise in the real world. The real world abounds in uncertainty, and any attempt to model aspects of the world should include some mechanism for incorporating uncertainty. There may be uncertainty in the understanding of the enterprise or in the quality or meaning of the data. There may be uncertainty in the model, which leads to uncertainty in entities or the attributes describing them. And at a higher level, there may be uncertainty about the level of uncertainty prevalent in various aspects of the database. In data mining applications, one must not only be aware of uncertainty, but also to exploit it in an effort to discover relationships in data that might not have been discovered otherwise.

A fundamental aspect of spatial data mining requiring uncertainty management is topology. Included in topology are relationships between various spatial data entities. Of particular interest are topological relations associated with regions having indeterminate, vague, or otherwise uncertain boundaries. Spatial relations such as intersects, adjacent, overlaps etc., have been used in discovering association rules and generalized attributes for spatial data[2]-[3]. We have also developed an extension to spatial association rules mining using a fuzzy set approach to represent the uncertainly in the spatial relationships used io the rules [4].

In this paper we develop the basis to also allow a rough set  0-7803-7280-8/02/$10.00 02002 IEEE 767  Frederick E.Pehy* Naval Research Laboratory  Mapping Charting and Geodesy Stennis Space Center MS 39529  '(Sabbatical leave from Tulane University, New Orleans LA)  approach to uncertainty in spatial relationships for association rules and other forms of spatial data mining.

In relational databases it has been demonstrated that uncertainty may be managed via rough set techniques by incorporating rough sets into the underlying data model [5] and through rough querying of crisp data [6]. In a previous work [7], we pointed out those areas peculiar to spatial databases and GIS which are in need of uncertainty management and suggest ways in which rough sets techniques may be used to alleviate the problems to result in a better overall system. Most of these unresolved problems are mentioned in one form or another in [ 11, which also provides an excellent background for spatial information systems. In this paper we focus on the problem of uncertainty in topological structures in spatial data, and in particular, to spatial regions with uncertain boundaries. We investigate the application of rough sets [8] for improving the RCC [9] and egg-yolk [lo] models. This will result in better uncertainty management, in general, for the spatial data system, and better results for data mining applications.



II. ROUGH SETS AND UNCERTAINTY IN DATA  Rough set theory, introduced by Pawlak [PI, is a technique for dealmg with uncertainty and for identifying cause-effect relationships in databases as a form of data mining and database learning [ 1 I]. It has also been used for improved information retrieval [ 121 and for uncertainty management in relational databases [5]-[6].

Rough sets involve the following: U is the universe, which cannot be empty, R is the indiscemibility relation, or equivalence relation, A = @,R), an ordered pair, is called an approximation space, [x]~ denotes the equivalence class ofR containing x, for any element x of U, elementav se*i in A - the equivalence classes of R, definable set in A - any f ~ t e  union of elementary sets in A.

Hence, the approximation space A results when an equivalence relation R is imposed upon the universe U. This partitions U into equivalence classes called elementary sets that may be used to define other sets in A. A rough set X is then defined in terms of the definable sets in A by the following: lower approximation ofXin A is the set  upper approximation of X in A is the set Ru={x I I X I R  GXl - R X = ( x ? U  1 [ x I R n X # Q .

We may also describe the set approximations in terms of regions. Given upper and lower approximations R X and U, of X, the R-positive region of X is POSR(X) =a, the R-negative region of X is NEGn(X) = U - R X, and the boundary or R-borderline region of X is BNR(X) = E X  - &X.

X is called Rdefinable if and only if &X = lower and upper approximation regions are not equal> and X is rough with respect to R. In Fig. 1 the universe U is partitioned into equivalence classes denoted by rectangles. Those classes in the lower approximation of X, POSR(X), are denoted with the letter P and classes in NEGR(X) by the letter N. Other classes belong to the boundary region of the upper approximation.

U  -  -

Otherwise, the  Consider the following example: Let U = {BRIDGE, ROAD, STREET, AVENUE, FACTORY,  Let the equivalence relation R be defmed as follows:  R* = {[bridge], [road, street, avenue], [factory, plant],  PLANT, FOREST, WOODS, BEACH, FIELD, MEADOW],  [FOREST, WOODS], [BEACH], [FIELD, MEADOW]}.

Given some set X = {BRIDGE, ROAD, STREET, AVENUE, FOREST, WCODS}, we can define it in terms of its lower and upper approximations:  - RX = {BRIDGE, ROAD, STREET, AVENIIE}, and R X = (BRIDGE, ROAD, STREET, AVENUE, FACTORY, -  PLANT, FOREST, WOODS}.

The major rough set concepts of interest are the use of an indiscemibility relation to partition domains into equivalence classes and the use of lower and upper approximation regions to allow the distinction between certain and possible (or partial) inclusion in a rough set.

The indiscemibility relation allows us to goup items based on some definition of ?equivalence? as it relates to the application domain. We may use this partitioning to increase or decrease the granularity of a domain, to group items together that are considered indiscemible for a given purpose, or to ?bin? ordered domains into range groups. Data mining applications may vary the partitioning of d o n ?  in systematic ways m the attempt to discover relationships or rules in the data. The indiscemibility relation is fundamental to rough sets. The  approximation regions can only be defmed in terms of the indiscemibility relation and the equivalence classes it creates.

certain results encountered in querying an ordinary spatial database system, we may employ the use of the boundary region information in addition to that of the lower approximation region. The results in the lower approximation region are certain. They correspond to exact matches. The boundary region of the upper approximation contains those results that are possible, but not certain. Data mining techniques which are based on rough sets discover both certain and possible rules &om the data. The approximation regions play an important role in the discussion of vague regions and topological relationships presented in a later section.

all types of databases systems. Spatial databases and GIS contain descriptive as well as positional data. The various forms of uncertainty occur in both types of data, so many of the issues discussed below apply to ordinary databases as well. See [ 5 , 6 ]  for in-depth discussion of implementation of rough set uncertainly in (non-spatial) databases. These same techniques, including integration of data from multiple sources, time-variant data, uncertain data, imprecision in measurement, inconsistent wording of descriptive data, and ?binning? or grouping of data into fixed categories, also are employed in spatial contexts [7].

Often spatial data is associated with a particular grid. The positions are set up in a regular matrix-like structure and data values are associated with point locations on the grid. There is a tradeoff between the resolution or scale of the grid and the amount of system resources necessary to store and process the data. Higher resolutions provide greater information, but at a cost of memory space and execution time. Data mining applications using high resolution data may sample it at a lower resolution in an effort to improve performance or to remove ?noise? which may prevent general relationships from being discovered  By taking a rough set viewpoint, one can see that there is indiscemibility inherent in the process of gridding or rasterizing data. A data item at a particular grid point in essence may represent data near the point as well. This is due to the fact that often point data must be mapped to the grid using techniques such as nearest-neighbor, averaging, or statistics. We may set up our rough set indiscemibility relation so that the entire spatial area is partitioned into equivalence classes where each point on the grid belongs to an equivalence class. If we change the resolution of the grid, we are in fact, changing the granularity of the partitioning, resulting in fewer, but larger classes.

The approximation regions of rough sets come into play whenever information concerning spatial data regions is accessed. Consider a region such as a forest. One can reasonably conclude that any grid point identified as FOREST that is surrounded on all sides by grid points also identified as FOREST is, in fact, a point represented by the feature FOREST. However, consider points identified as FOREST that are adjacent to points identified as MEADOW.

In order to allowpossible results, in addition to the obvious,  Many of the problems associated with data are prevalent in  0-7803-7280-8/02/$10.00 02002 IEEE 768    Is it not possible that these points represent meadow area as well as forest area but were identified as FOREST in the classification process? Likewise, points identified as MEADOW but adjacent to FOREST points may represent areas that contain part of the forest. This uncertainty maps naturally to the use of the approximation regions of the rough set theory, where the lower approximation region represents certain data and the boundary region of the upper approximation represents uncertain data. It applies to spatial database querying and spatial database mining operations.

If we force a finer granulation of the partitioning (increase the grid resolution) a smaller boundary region results. As the partitioning becomes finer and finer, fmally a point is reached where the boundary region is non-existent. Then the upper and lower approximation regions are the same and there is no uncertainty in the spatial data.

The RCC and egg-yolk methods, which we discuss in later sections, are approaches for handling regions with uncertain boundaries. They use two levels for outlining the vague boundary, which basically corresponds to the approximation regions of rough set theory. These methods, however, provide no facilities for partitioning the domain into equivalence classes, as done in rough sets via the indiscemibility relation.

In fact, Roy and Stell [I31 discuss the shortcomings of the egg-yolk method if it is to be applied to discrete rather than continuous space. They suggest that the egg-yolk method can be used in a multi-resolution context for a f ~ t e  level of precision and that an extension to the framework may be appropriate. By varying the partitioning in rough sets we can increase or decrease the level of uncertainty present. This results in changes to the approximation regions that define the rough set representation of a region with indeterminate or vague boundaries. The idea that rough sets can, in fact, improve on other spatial data frameworks by quantifying the uncertainty in terms of varying levels of indiscemibility is part of the motivation behind this research.

111. TOPOLOGICAL UNCERTAINTY IN SPATIAL DATA  In GIS or spatial databases, it is often the case that we need information conceming the relative positions or distances of objects. Is object A udjacenf lo object B? Or, is object A near object B? The first question appears to be fairly straightforward. The system must simply check all the edges of both objects to see if any parts of them are coincident. This gives the certuin results. However, often in GIS, data is input either automatically via scanners or digitized by humans, and in both cases it is easy for error in position of data objects to occur. Therefore, we may also want to have the system check to see if object B is very near object A, to derive thepossible result. If so, the user could be informed that ?it is not certain, hut it is possible, that A is adjacent to B.?  Assume we are investigating coastal bird feeding habitats and trying to uncover any relationships that might exist between the number of bird sigbtings and coastal structure.

One species of bird may require low flat coastal land for feeding on small shellfish. Other types may feed on insects  found near their nesting sites in the sides of cliffs. Suppose that for a particular location the system r e m s  results based on the possibility that a high cliff is adjacent to the sea where birds have been sighted that feed in areas of flat coastal land.

We may then be led to investigate the influence of the tides in the area to determine whether low beaches alongside the cliffs are exposed at low tide.

by rough sets in comparably. Connection is similar to adjacency, but related to vector or line type objects rather than area objects. Two objects are connected if they have a common meeting point on one end of each of the objects. It is very easy for spatial data of this type, especially if the data is from different sources, to not match up precisely. We may then want to also define what would constitute possible connection, based on perhaps the distance between the objects and the length and orientation of the linear features.

For example, if one road feature varying in curvature, but generally oriented from west to east, ends at some point A, and we find a second road, also oriented in an east/west fashion near its beginning at point B a short distance away from A, we may conclude that possibly these two road features are connected, even though they share no common  Overlap can be defined in a manner similar to that of nearness with the user deciding how much overlap is required for the lower approximation. Coincidence of a single point may constitute possible overlap, as can very close proximity of two objects, if there is a high degree of positional error involved in the data.

Inclusion is related to overlap in the following way. If an object A is completely surrounded by some object B, perhaps we can conclude certainly that A is included in B, lacking additional information about the objects. If tbe objects overlap, then it ispossible that one object includes the other.

Approximation regions can be defmed to reflect these concepts as well.

Rough sets, RCC theory, and egg-yolk approaches are useful for managing the types of uncertainty and vagueness related to topology, a few of which were just briefly discussed. These include concepts such as nearness, contiguity, connection, orientation, inclusion, and overlap of spatial entities. We will consider next some of the topological relationships associated with vague regions and how they relate to each other using the RCC approach.

The concepts of connection and overlap can be managed  point.



IV. RCC-8 THEORY OF SPATIAL REGIONS RCC-8 theory [9] is a qualitative reasoning technique for  spatial data based on regions rather than points. For any two simple regions, relations are defined that may hold between them. The eight base relations that bold between two given simple regions are depicted in Figure 2 below. One and only one of these relations can hold for a pair of vague regions.

They are PO (Partially Overlapping), TPP (Tangential Proper Part), NTPP (Non-Tangential Proper Part), EQ (Equal), NTPPI (Non-Tangential Proper Part Inverse), TPPl  0-7803-7280-8/02/$10.00 022002 IEEE 769    (Tangential Proper Part Inverse), EC (Externally Connected), and DC (Disconnected).

In [IO] the RCC method is extended to regions with vague boundaries rather than simple regions. In that work, only five of the above RCC-8 relations are applicable (called RCC-5).

These include PO (Partially Overlapping), PP (Proper Part, when TPP and NTPP are combined), EQ (Equal), PPI (Proper Part Inverse, when NTPPI and TPPI are combined), and DR (Distinct Regions, when EC and DC are combined).

There are a large number of relationships that can occur between two vague regions, since each vague region has two boundaries. The research in [IO] lists all the possible relationships and clusters them into a hierarchy based on RCC relations and the effects of ?crisping?. A sample of the some of the 46 possible relationships is depicted in Figure 3.



V. ROUGH SET MODELING OF RCC-8 RELATIONS Recall that a rough set is comprised of two crisp regions,  each of these regions defined in terms of the underlying equivalence relation. There are two ways that we can approach using rough set techniques with RCC-8 spatial relationships. The first, somewhat trivial but illustrative, is to  compare the upper and lower approximation regions of a rough set with each of the RCC-8 relations. The second approach is to consider each of the regions as being rough.

This approach results in a far greater number of possibilities, some of which can be found in Figure 3.

In relating the approximation regions of a rough set separately with the two regions in an RCC-8 relation, it is easy to see that only five of the RCC -8 relations are possible: TPP(X,Y), NTPP(X,Y), EQ(X,Y), TPPI(X,Y), and NTPPI(X,Y). This is because in a rough set the lower approximation region must be a subset of the upper approximation region. This condition does not hold true for the relations PO(X,Y), EC(X,Y), or DC(X,Y). Also, note that for the EQ(X,Y) relation, the upper and lower approximation regions are equal, resulting in a crisp set having no uncertainty. We are not interested, however, in simply combining two crisp regions in a relationship and expressing those as a single rough set. What we are interested in are the spatial relationships occurring between two vague regions, each represented as a rough set.

Let us now consider the RCC-8 relations in terms of two vague regions denoted by rough sets X and Y defined on some approximation space. The determination of whether or not a relationship holds for these two rough regions can also be expressed as a rough set. In the discussion that follows, the RCC-8 relations will be expressed in terms of rough set approximation regions. In [IO] the 46 relationships are listed along with ?possible? representation of each of the RCC-8 relationships. The word ?possible? is used here because there is more generality present than when using rough sets to express the relationships. The RCC-8 relationships can be described in terms of CERTAINLY HOLDS or POSSIBLY HOLDS if rough sets are used in this manner, as well as for defining the regions themselves.

Y are disconnected. a i s  is certainly true when &Y = 0 and R X  n R Y  = 0, whichcan be seen inFigure 3, Sample 1. However, it is possible that the relation holds  w h e n a  n &Y = 0 and E X  n R Y  # 0. This occurs in samples 2-13, 19,28,34, and 42, some of which may be found in Figure 3. In [IO], we fmd that an additional sample, Sample 1, also belongs to the relationship. There is no distinction between those that are certain and those that are possible. With rough set representation there is such a distinction, resulting in greater information. (Consult [IO] for the complete list of relationship region figures.)  For the EQ(X,Y) relationship to hold certainly, &X = RY  and E X  = z Y. The EQ relationship possibly holds when Rx = RY and either R X R Y or Y R X. There are only twoadditional samples included in this possible region for the relationship. In [lo], there are about 18 possibilities because the restriction on the inner boundaries being equal is relaxed. For rough sets, where this inner boundary is defined by the lower approximation region, equality must hold.

The DC(X,Y) relationship holds when the rough sets X and n  - - -  0-7803-7280-8/02/$10.00 02002 IEEE I 770    The relations TPP(X,Y) and NTPP(X,Y) are indistinguishable in rough sets theory. They together denote inclusion of rough set X in rough set Y. In rough set terms, X c Y w h e n u  E &Y and R X c k Y. The relations TPPI(X,Y) and NTPPI(X,Y) are analogous to TPP(X,Y) and NTPP(X,Y). One may simply exchange the X and Y in the relation and discussion for TPP or NF?P to get the same results.

Grouped together these four relations certainly hold for 9 samples and possibly hold for Sample 46. In [IO] all but five of the pairs may be categorized as having this relationship.

Partial overlap PO(X,Y) implies that X and Y are not equal, hut that they have some part in common. Rough set expression of this relationship involves intersection and equality. This relationship will certainly hold whenever n BY # 0 and R X n k Y # 0. It will possibly bold when X n k Y # 0. These results are identical to the 41 samples in [IO] that meet the requirements for partially overlapping.

denote that two rough sets intersect at exactly one point, the EC(X,Y) relationship does not apply. It expresses the same relationship as those belonging to the possible region for the PO relationship discussed previously.

It is evident from the discussion above that rough sets can be used to model relationships for vague regions defined by the RCC method. By allowing the expression of belonging to the relationship to be either certain or possible, however, we gain greater insight into the relationship, therefore greater  -  -  Because rough set theory does not allow us to specifically  called ?immediate conceptual neighbors? if ?each can be transformed into the other by a process of gradual, continuous change that does not involve passage through any third relation.? The RCCJ  relations include DR (Distinct Regions with no overlap), EQ (Equal: the regions are the same), PO (the regions Partially Overlap), PP (Proper Part: the first region is entirely contained within the second), and PPI (Proper Part Inverse: the fust region entirely contains the second). For egg-yolk pairs a yolk is a PP of its own egg.

The 46 configurations of egg-yolk pairs were then clustered into 13 groups based on RCC-5 relations between complete crispings, or relations that are ?mutually crispable? (see Figure 4). The clusters each relate to one or more additional clusters via a crisping relationship or a subset relationship between a set of complete crispings. Each configuration of a cluster can be crisped to the cluster pointed to by the arrow via one of these relationships.

These regions indicate a type of membership in the vague region. The simplest case, is that of two subregions. In this most corn" case, the center region is known as the yolk, the outer region surrounding the yolk is known as the white, and the entire region, as the egg.

The yolk and egg comespond to boundary regions ofrough sets. Rough set theory has only these two approximation regions, unlike the possible numerous subregions that make  of the indiscemibility relation in rough sets, we can vary the partitioning to increase or decrease the level of uncertainty

A comparison of the rough set relationships expressed for each cluster with the RCC relationships denoted for the clusters in Figure 4 reveals similar properties. Consider, for example, cluster M. This cluster is based on the RCC relations EQ and PPI, which means that the regions might be equal or that region X entirely contains region Y. In rough sets, this relationship is defmed through the use of the approximation regions. The upper approximation region of Y is equal to the lower approximation of X. We know certainly then, that Y is contained in X. It is also possible, however, that X and Y are the same (equal).

Rough set techniques for information retrieval and data mining in spatial databases and GIS, may be applied to models with vague regions expressed by the egg-yolk model, and those based on the RCC theory. Rough sets provides a solid mathematical foundation for vague regions that is compatible with other spatial data theories and methods, yet offers an added ability to refine the indiscemibility.



VIII. CONCLUSION Spatial and geographical information systems will continue  to play an ever-increasing role in applications based on spatial data. Uncertainty management will be necessary for any of these applications, and rough sets, RCC, and egg-yolk methods are appropriate for the representation of vague regions in spatial data. Rough sets, however, can also model indiscemibility and allow for the change of granularity of the partitioning through its indiscemibility relation. Changing the indiscemibility relation has an effect on the boundaries of the vague regions because the lower and upper approximation regions are defined in terms of this indiscemibility. Rough se1 techniques can also be used to define spatial relationships  themselves. So there is a distinction between combinations that certainly meet the RCC-8 relationship requirements and those that possibly meet the requirements. The rough set approach, therefore, is very useful in defining vague spatial regions with indeterminate boundaries, and in defining spatial relationships holding between vague regions.

We have also shown how the clustering of egg-yolk pairs by RCC-5 relations can be expressed in terms of operations using rough sets. We believe that rough set techniques can further enhance the egg-yolk approach and are investigating the interrelationships between rough set, egg-yolk, RCC, and other spatial models. We are also investigating the impact of vagueness and uncertainty expressed with these theories on the querying and mining of spatial data, allowing a rough set approach to uncertainty in spatial relationships for association rules and other forms of spatial data mining.
