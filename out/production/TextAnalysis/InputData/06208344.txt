Abstract? In conventional network security simply relies on mathematical algorithms and low counter measures to taken to prevent intrusion detection system, although most of this approaches in terms of theoretically challenged to implement.

Therefore, a variety of algorithms have been committed to this challenge. Instead of generating large number of rules the evolution optimization techniques like Genetic Network Programming (GNP) can be used .The GNP is based on directed graph, In this paper the security issues related to deploy a data mining-based IDS in a real time environment is focused upon.

We generalize the problem of GNP with association rule mining and propose a fuzzy weighted association rule mining with GNP framework suitable for both continuous and discrete attributes.

Our proposal follows an Apriori algorithm based fuzzy WAR and GNP and avoids pre and post processing thus eliminating the extra steps during rules generation. This method can sufficient to evaluate misuse and anomaly detection. Experiments on KDD99Cup and DARPA98 data show the high detection rate and accuracy compared with other conventional method.

I. INTRODUCTION Nowadays, many computing resources like on-line oriented applications have been developed, and this type of computing fragile in network security measures. The expansion of Internet technology has thrown severe challenges in form of requirement of a suitable misuse and anomaly detection to safeguard the valuable information stored on system and for information in transit.

An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is expected to identify cruel behaviors that menace the integrity, confidentiality and availability of network resources. It can help to detect suspicious activities in the network .Likewise the major conventional detection techniques: misuse detection and anomaly detection.

Misuse detection systems [1],[2] are most widely used and they detect intruders with known patterns and signatures used to identify attacks that consist of various fields of network  based packet information, like source address, destination address, and source and destination ports. This model needs continuous updating because of Adhoc network, but they have a virtue of having very low false positive rate. Anomaly detection systems identify deviations from normal user Behavior and alert to potential unknown or novel attacks without having any prior knowledge of them. They exhibit higher rate of false alarms and hence the need for a mechanism to reduce false approach arises. The traditionally detection methods are not suitable in fast growing network environment, and it also not considered for focusing massive knowledge of engineering and information security task, experts are involved to analyzes the various mathematical methods for anomaly detection and also concentrate on various sequence code and patterns to detect the misuse detection, everything is computerized by machine learning code to detect the detection. These methods are not suitable for current dynamic nature environment. Basic ideas for [3],[4] are enabled in to system to record the activities like system events, legitimate activities and intrusion behavior. But this type of measures need advanced tools and techniques to detect suspicious activities. Both detection methods have been extensively studied by the research community for many years.

KDD99Cup and DARPA98 datasets [5],[6] provided by MIT Lincoln Laboratory?s are widely used as training and testing datasets for the evaluation of IDSs KDDCUP?99 intrusion detection dataset contains a standard dataset and training data to be audited .It analyzes the connections of 41 features. All the connections can be divided into 5 categories including normal network connection, and other four categories are Denial of Service Attack (DOS), User to Root Attack (U2R), Remote to Local Attack (R2L) and Probing Attack.

Data mining technology has emerged as a mean for identifying patterns and trends from large quantities of data.

Data mining is a step in Knowledge Discovery in database. It has been extracted large number of rules. The most popular        model for mining association rules from databases its support- confidence framework proposed by Agrawal et al.. In this algorithm, association rules meet user-specified constraints such as minimum support or minimum confidence. However, this algorithm may suffer from large computational overheads for rule extraction from dense database.

GNP is a evolutionary optimization technique using unique graph structure instead of strings and tree, it evolves on Programming and algorithm, GNP composed of three kinds of nodes: initial node, judgment node and processing node.

Genetic Algorithm (GA) [7],[8],[9] has been applied to the association rule mining. However, it is not easy for GA-based methods to extract enough number of interesting rules, because a rule is represented as an individual population of GA. In our proposed method using the fuzzy weighted association rule mining combining with GNP.The main aim is to push the weight constraints into the pattern growth Apriori algorithm and provides a way to satisfy downward closure property. Attributes are given different weights within the weight range. Attributes in database correspond to judgment nodes in GNP. Weighted fuzzy Association rules are represented by the connections of nodes. Candidates of important rules are obtained by genetic algorithms. Then, the probability density function of the average matching degree of the data with rules can be calculated. Based on this, new connection data can be easily classified into normal activity, known or unknown intrusion.

The paper is organized as follows. The background information of GNP, Fuzzy with Genetic Algorithmic overviewed in Section II, and Fuzzy Weight Association Rule Mining, Fuzzy WAR combined with Apriori Algorithm, Fuzzy WAR based Genetic Algorithm and Evaluation Function and operations is explained in detail in Section III.

Section IV describes the specific Probability Functions.

Simulation results with databases KDD99Cup are given in Section V. Finally, the conclusions and Future work are mentioned in Section VI.



II. OVERVIEW  A. Basic structure of GNP Genetic network programming is an evolutionary optimaz-  ation algorithm, which evolves directed graph structures as solutions instead of using strings in genetic algorithms or trees in genetic programming.GNP [10],[11] ,[13] framework is which includes one initial node, multiples judgment nodes and processing nodes. Initial node acts as booting node and it contains no processing information like function or no conditional branch. The only role of the initial node is to determine the first node to be executed. Judgment nodes have some special function that is embedded and it takes judgment based as individual rules. Processing nodes work as action/processing functions. The selection of the current node is influenced by the node transitions of the past selection.

Therefore, the graph structure itself has an implicit memory function of the past agent actions. The node transition begins from the start node, and then the next node which will be executed is determined by the node transition and the number of nodes and their concrete functions depend on the problem,  which are determined by the designers.

Fig.1 is The GNP in this figure has one start node, five  judgments nodes and three processing nodes. The initial node i is only for determining which node should be the first node to be executed. The sets of J1, J2, ...,Jm represents judgment nodes which have conditional branch decision functions, and return judgment results so as to determine the next node.

Processing nodes, like P1, P2, ...,Pn serve as action functions to determine which action should be taken. The number of nodes and their concrete functions depend on the problems which are determined by the designers.

The genotype expression of GNP in a GNP individual. NTi denotes node type. 0 is initial node, 1 is processing node, 2 is judgment node. IDi Works as the identification number. Ci1, Ci2,..Mean the nodes connected from node i, firstly, secondly...

and so on. And TD1, TD2..., TDiK denote the time delays of the transition from node i to node Ci1,Ci2..., CiK respectively.

Fig.1. Genotype and phenotype of GNP framework   Three kinds of genetic operators, i.e., selection, crossover and mutation, are implemented in GNP.

1)  Selection: Individuals survived and passed into the next generation on the basis of fitness of each individual i.e.

Selection mechanism sensitive for converging populations with close fitness values.

Selection can be categorized into Parent selection and survivor selection.

1a) Parent selection: It can be focusing into Fitness- proportionate.

2b) Survivor selections: It can be represented into all children replace parents.

2)   Cross over: Two new populations are generated from two parents by exchanging the genetic information. Connections are interchanged with each other by crossover rate Pc.

Crossover is explorative.

3)  Mutation: One new individual population is generated from one original individual population it creates random small path, thereby staying near in the area of the parent.

mutation & crossovers only applicable for bit-string & integer representations.

B. Fuzzy with Genetic Algorithm Fuzzy sets are functions that map a value, which might be a member of a set, to a number between zero and one, indicating its actual degree of membership [19]. A degree of zero means that the value is not in the set and a degree of one means that the value is completely representative of the set.

III. PROPOSED SYSTEM  A. Fuzzy Weighted Association Rule Mining In weighted association rule mining (WARM), item sets are  no longer simply counted as they appear in a transaction [16],[17],[18],[19],[20]. This change of counting mechanism makes it necessary to adapt traditional support to weighted support. The goal of using weighted support is to make use of the weight in the mining process and prioritize the selection of target item sets according to their significance in the dataset, rather than their frequency alone.

Definition 1: Fuzzy Weighted Support (FWS) is the aggregated sum of all the transactions item set is present, divided by the total number of transactions.

It is denoted as:  FWS(X) = ??? ?? ???  ??? ???? ?????	? ?? ?	???? ?               (1)   Weighted support FWS of item set (A, B) is calculated as  FWS(A,B)= ?? ?? ???  ??? ????(?,?)????	? ?? ?	???? ?? ?  (2)  Definition 2: Fuzzy Weighted Confidence (FWC) is the ratio of sum of votes satisfying both X ? satisfying X with Z = ?Y . It is formulated as:  FWC(X?Y)=???(?)???(?)                              (3)  Fuzzy can be combined with association rule mining to extract a number of useful rules to detect an intrusion in networks shown in Fig.3.Pb can be refers to the probability density functions, w can be used in Fuzzy weighted rules.

B. Fuzzy WAR combined with Apriori Algorithm After a detailed research and statistical analysis to extract a  weighted association rule mining from Association rule mining it can be used and accept a some modification from existing rules mining. ARM can be limited to support the minimum threshold values address this problem. The proposed a new fuzzy weighted association rule combined with genetic algorithm, which generalizes the popular Apriori algorithm can be used to extract large frequent dataset.

The FWARM algorithm is shown in Fig.4.Cc is the set of candidate item sets of cardinality c, wi is the set of weights associated to items I.Fi is the set of frequent item sets, WSupp its represents a weighted support, WSConf its represents a weighted support count, WC its represents a weighted count, R is the set of potential rules and R? is the final set of generated fuzzy weighted ARS.

C. Fuzzy WAR based Genetic Algorithm A genetic algorithm (GA) is a search technique used in  calculating to find exact or approximate solutions to optimization and search problems. Inspired by Theory of evolution by Darwin the solutions generated by GA are         Fig.3.Fuzzy weighted association rule mining Framework.

Genetic algorithm is an optimizing search technique and has been widely applied to a optimization of finding the frequent rules in a given set and it can help to find out the more accuracy rates when compared to the other conventional ones.

Fig.5. Fuzzy WAR based Genetic Algorithm  Fig.5. By using this algorithm helps to find out the accuracy of given data set and reduce the rate false alarm (PFR and NFR), we can evaluate by using the following parameters.

F=?*AC+((?i(NFR+PFR)),                       (4)   Where, AC is the accuracy which represents the rate of classifying data correctly, NFR is a negative false rate.

E. Evaluation Function and Operations In this paper, we defined the evaluation function (otherwise  called as fitness function) which can be specified of GNP individuals is defined as follows.

F=+%'%++-.&/0(r),                     (5)  Where, W1&W2 =1 (High control parameter),  '%=  123  145146 17  .

Ntc = Number of connections correctly detected by rule r; Nt    =  Number of connections in the training data;  Nni   = Number of normal connections incorrectly detected by rule r;  Nn     =   Number of normal connections in the training data.



IV. PROBABILITY FUNCTIONS The key points of probabilistic classification concerns three  aspects. First, the probability density function of the average matching degree of data with rules is used. Second, the probability that data is classified to anomaly intrusion. Third, in order to improve the classification accuracy, weights are used to revise the probability.

A. Probability Density Function The probability density function is generated as the  following. First, the matching degree of each data d with every rule in the rule pool is calculated. The definition of the matching degree between the continuous attribute Ai with linguistic term Qi and data ai of attribute Ai is represented as:   MD(Qi,ai) = MQ(a),                               (6)   where, MQ represents the membership function of linguistic term Qi. Then, the matching degree between data and rule r (including p continuous attributes and q discrete attributes) is defined as:  Matchi(d,r)=? 9:(;6,?< )=>;"?@ +  =>;,                    (7)   where, i is the suffix of continuous attributes in rule r; I denotes the set of suffixes of continuous attributes in rule r; p and q represent the number of continuous attributes and discrete attributes in rule r, respectively, and t is the number of matched discrete attributes in rule r with data. Then, the average matching degree can be defined as:  mkg=  % |AB|  ? CDE!?#(G, $)H?AB ,                      (8)   where, Rk is the set of suffixes of the extracted rules in class k in the rule pool(normal rules or misuse rules). Finally, the marginal probability density function fi(xi),i=1,2,3?.k can be generated by calculating the distribution of the average matching degree of training data d? J2HK"&(k) with r? Rk, where, J2HK"&(k) is the set of suffix of training data in class k.

K = 2 is used in this paper.

B. Building a Classifier The probability that new connection data d ? J2/L2  belongs  to class k is represented as follow:   Pk(d)=? fN(xN)dxN . . .%.P?Q(?) ? fN(xN)dxN . . .

?Q(?)  P ? f%(x%)dx% %.P  ?%(?) ,   (9)  where, J2/L2 as the set of suffix of testing data. Actually, the  probability that d ? J2/L2  belongs to anomaly class is defined as follows:   RP(d) = 1?? PN(d),N?T                               (10)   where, as the set of suffix of classes having training data. In  the case of two classes, the probabilities of the first class and   Begin g->0                         //number of generations initialize pop(g)                //pop(g) : population for Generation evaluate ff (pop(i))           // ff(pop(g)) : fitness function while(not termination condition) do begin (i)->i+1 select 2 parents p1and p2from matting pool pop(g-1) // Performs genetic operations if (each consecutive pair(P1 and P2) apply crossover with probability pc) else (each offspring apply mutation (bit-flip with probability pm independently for each bit) end if replace the whole population with the resulting  offspring reproduce a new pop(g) evaluate ff(pop(g)) end        the second class can be calculated by the following equations.

R%(d) = ? V-(W-)dW-%.PXY(?) ? V%(W%)GW%  XZ(?) P ,         (11)   R-(d) = ? V-(W-)dW-XY(?)P ? V%(W%)GW%  %.P XZ(?) ,         (12)   Based on the calculation of these probabilities, d is assigned  to the class with the highest probability.

C. Revision of Probability In intrusion detection, in order to balance positive false rate  (PFR) and negative false rate (NFR), we assigned the following weights to adjust [\(]) and[P(G):   R#(d)= ^#P[#P(]) _1 +  ? 0Bbc(e)Bgh 0ibi(])  j              (13)   where,  ^#P = 0B0i , [#P(]) = bc(e) bi(#)  , ^P and ^# (k?C) are the weight parameters.



V. SIMULATIONS To evaluate the detection level, we conducted an experiment  on intrusion detection database of KDDCUP 1999 (KDDCUP?99) which is publicly available for open source.

This dataset is containing a detection dataset and training dataset which really helps to classify the intrusion or normal network connections. This network dataset is simulating a typical U.S. Air Force LAN and also reflecting dynamic changes within the network.

In the KDDCUP?99 dataset, each record represents a TCP/IP network connection with a total of 41 features. All the connections can be divided into 5 categories including normal network connection, and others are categories into Denial- Of- Service (DOS), Root-To-Local (R2L), User-To-Root (U2R) and Probing .We choose 10,000 network connections from KDDCUP?99 dataset which consists of 5,000 normal network connections and 5,000 intrusion network connections including two kinds of attack connections, neptune and smurf parameters are shown in Table. I. The program was based on Fuzzy Weighted Association rule mining combined with GNP shown in Fig.6.

VI. CONCLUSION The proposed method, that is, Fuzzy weighted association  rule mining algorithm based on GNP, combines genetic algorithm and probabilistic classification in order to extract more important rules from the database. In addition, the classification method is based on the probability distribution of the average matching degree between data and different class rules. As a result, simulations show higher DR, Accuracy and lower PFR, NFR, which means that Fuzzy weighted association rule mining algorithm based on GNP has better performance than the conventional class association rule mining.
