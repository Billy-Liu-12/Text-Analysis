Prediction of Outer Membrane Proteins by Support Vector Machines Using

Abstract  Discriminating outer membrane proteins from proteins with other subcellular localizations and with other folding  classes are both important to predict further their func-  tions and structures. In this paper, we propose a method  for discriminating outer membrane proteins from other  proteins by Support Vector Machines using combinations  of gapped amino acid pair compositions. Using 5-fold cross-validation, the method achieves 95% precision and  92% recall on the dataset of proteins with well-annotated  subcellular localizations, consisting of 471 outer mem-  brane proteins and 1,120 other proteins. When applied on  another dataset of 377 outer membrane proteins and 674 globular proteins belonging to four typical structural  classes, the method reaches 96% precision and recall and  correctly excludes 98% of the globular proteins. Our  method outperforms the OM classifier of PSORTb v.2.0  and a method based on dipeptide composition.

Introduction  Outer membrane proteins (OMPs) are resident at the  outer membrane of Gram-negative bacterial cell, mito-  chondria and chloroplast. They are responsible for various  important biological functions and generally form them-  selves into -barrel structures. OMPs consist of a special  class of proteins due to their distinct subcellular localiza-  tion (outer membrane) and structures. Discriminating  them from other proteins helps in predicting further their  functions and structures.

Several classification technologies have been applied  to predict OMPs  or -barrel membrane proteins (proteins  ______________________________________________ * This work was partially supported by the National Science Council of  Taiwan, R.O.C., under Grants NSC-94-2745-E-155-008-URD  that have -barrel structures). They include Hidden  Markov Model (HMM) [1, 2, 3], Neural Network [4],  Support Vector Machine (SVM) [5, 6], association rule  [5] and statistical methods [7, 8]. HMM-based methods  predict -barrel membrane proteins by modeling the pro-  totype of -barrel structures. It performs worse when all-  globular or all-  soluble proteins are given to it to predict.

Liu et al. [4] combined a linear Neural Network classifier  with predicted secondary structures and obtained an im-  provement on excluding all-  soluble proteins. However,  the performance depends on the quality of secondary  structure prediction. She et al. [5] proposed three methods.

Two methods based on association rules and one based on  SVM. Their results showed that the latter outperformed  the former two. Gromiha and Suwa [7] developed a statis-  tical method based on the amino acid composition for  discriminating OMPs from other proteins. An improved  statistical method based on the weighted dipeptide com-  position was proposed later by Gromiha et al. [8] and they  obtained better results.

Various features were used to predict OMPs. HMM-  based methods [1, 2, 3] were based on the information of  transmembrane regions of known structures. The Neural  Network classifier [4] was based on the amino acid com-  position difference between the transmembrane regions of  12 -barrel OMPs and the -strands of 79 all-  soluble  proteins. Zhai et al. [9] used the occurrences of N-  terminal targeting sequences and the information of sec-  ondary structures, hydropathy and amphipathicity for pre-  diction. Berven et al. [10] proposed a method based on a  C-terminal pattern of 12 known structural OMPs and on  an integral -barrel score based on the amino acid distri-  bution in a 10-residue sliding window. These features  described above were derived from protein sequences  with known structures. However, at present, there are  rather few OMPs or -barrel membrane proteins with  known structures.

Several method used features derived only from se-  quences were also proposed. Gromiha et al. [7] used the  amino acid composition difference between OMPs and  globular proteins. The dipeptide composition was used  Proceedings of the 5th IEEE Symposium on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering (BIBE?05)     later in [8]. She et al. [5] extracted frequent subsequences  from OMPs as association rules for prediction. Further-  more, they represented protein sequence as occurrences of  frequent subsequences for SVM classification. Their re-  sults outperform the sequence-profile-based HMM  method [1]. Gardy et al. [6] further introduced the fre-  quent-subsequence-based SVM method into the PSORTb  v.2.0 program for protein subcellular localization (SCL)  prediction. They constructed 9 SVM classifiers based on  frequent subsequences wherein each one predicts a spe-  cific SCL of Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria.

Previous works demonstrated that amino acid compo-  sition and amino acid pair compositions both provide use-  ful information for SCL prediction. Hua and Sun [11]  proposed a SVM approach based on amino acid composi-  tion. Park and Kanehisaf [12] reported a comparison of  performances of different compositions on amino acids,  amino acid pairs and one to three gapped amino acid pairs.

Guo et al. [13] further combined different amino acid pair  compositions (called residue-couple model in their paper).

Each protein was represented as a vector consisting of  these compositions for SVM classification. They showed  that their method outperforms the method of Hua and Sun  [11].

In this paper, we propose a method for OMP prediction  by Support Vector Machines using the combinations of  gapped amino acid pair compositions. Two datasets were  used. One dataset consists of protein sequences with ex-  perimentally verified SCLs. It was obtained from  PSORTdb v.2.0 [14]. Using 5-fold cross-validation, the  performance achieves a precision of 95% with a recall of  92%. The other dataset consists of OMPs and globular  proteins belonging to four typical structural classes. The  performance achieves as high as 96% in precision and  recall while up to 98% globular proteins were correctly  excluded (also named the recall of globular proteins, de-  fined in Section 3.1). Compared to the method based on  dipeptide composition [8], the result shows an increase of  18% in excluding globular proteins. Experimental results  show that our method outperforms the frequent-  subsequence-based SVM method [6] and the dipeptide-  composition-based statistical method [8].

2. Materials and methods  2.1. Datasets  In this section, we describe two datasets. Each of them  is represented as two classes for constructing a binary  predictor to discriminate OMPs from other proteins.

2.1.1. Dataset 1. PSORTb v.2.0 program [6] contains 9  SVM classifiers for protein SCL prediction. Each classi-  fier predicts a specific SCL. One of the 9 classifiers is  used for predicting OMPs. The dataset which was applied  to the classifier contains proteins annotated as having a  single SCL or dual SCLs of Gram-negative bacteria. (A  protein annotated as dual SCLs means that this protein  can exist at two SCLs.) The dataset was represented as  two classes by Gardy et al. [6], namely the OM class  (consisting of OMPs) and the NOM (non-OM) class (con-  sisting of other proteins) in [5]. The same dataset and  class representation are also used in this paper. We denote  the dataset as dataset 1. The composition of dataset 1 and  its class representation are listed at Table 1. There are 471  sequences belonging to OM class and 1,120 sequences  belonging to NOM class. SCLs of protein sequences in  the dataset are all experimentally verified. The dataset is  available from PSORTdb v.2.0 online at http://www.psort.

org/dataset [14].

Table 1. Composition of dataset 1 represented as two classes. The meanings of the below abbreviations of SCL sites are: OM, outer membrane; P, periplasmic; EC, extracellular; C, cytoplasmic; CM, cytoplasmic membrane.

A ?/? indicates the dual SCLs.

[7, 8] developed a  method for discriminating OMPs from globular proteins  belonging to four typical structural classes. The dataset  they used consists of 377 OMPs and 674 globular proteins  with known structures, including 155 all-  proteins, 156  all-  proteins, 184 +  proteins, and 179 /  proteins  (available online at http://www.cbrc.jp/~gromiha/omp/  dataset.html). We denote it as dataset 2 and use it to  evaluate our method for the same purpose as Gromiha et  al. In this paper, the set of the 377 OMPs is referred to as  OM class and the set of the 674 globular proteins as NOM  class.

2.2. Calculation of k-gapped amino acid pair  composition  In this section, we define the k-gapped amino acid pair composition based on the residue-couple model [13]. A  protein sequence is represented as a series of one-letter  codes:  R1R2R3?RN,  Proceedings of the 5th IEEE Symposium on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering (BIBE?05)     where Rn denotes the amino acid in location n (n = 1, 2,  3, ?, N and N is the sequence length). The occurrence frequency of an amino acid pair along the sequence is  defined as the following expression:  ( )1,  1 1   ,, ++?? =  ??  =  knnO kN  F kN  n  ji  k  ji ,  where k N 2, Oi,j(n, n + k + 1) = 1 if the amino acid in  location n is i and the one in location n + k + 1 is j, other- wise Oi,j(n, n + k + 1) = 0. The values of i and j range  from 1 to 20, representing the 20 different amino acids.

The k-gapped amino acid pair composition Gk is then  defined as  G k = ( ,,...,,, 20,13,12,11,1  kkkk FFFF  ,,...,,, 20,23,22,21,2 kkkk FFFF  ?, kkkk FFFF 20,203,202,201,20 ,...,,,  ),  where k N  2. Therefore, a k-gapped amino acid pair  composition is a 400-dimensional vector. In this paper, G  is called non-gapped amino acid pair composition. G  is  called one-gapped amino acid pair composition, G is  called two-gapped amino acid pair composition, and so  forth.

2.3. Combination of k-gapped amino acid pair  compositions  As described above, a series of k-gapped amino acid  pair compositions with different k can be derived from a protein sequence, each of which presents the sequence  order information indirectly. We combine these composi-  tions into a vector to represent the characteristic of a pro-  tein sequence.

To define different combinations of k-gapped amino  acid pair compositions, we first define a combination in-  dex vector of degree d as  S = ( s(1), s(2), s(3), ?, s(d) ),  where d N  1, 0 s(t) N  2 and s(u) s(v) (1 t, u,  v d and N is the sequence length). The combination of k- gapped amino acid pair compositions with degree d is  then defined as  C = (G s(1)  , G s(2)  , G s(3)  , ?, G s(d)  )  to represent the characteristic of a protein sequence.

Therefore, there are 400 d features for a protein se-  quence and C is a 400d-dimensional vector. For example,  a protein sequence is represented as a vector, consisting of  one-, three- and five-gapped amino acid pair compositions.

In this case, s(1) = 1, s(2) = 3, s(3) = 5, S = (1, 3, 5) and C  = (G , G  , G  ).

Based on the definitions described above, the accumu-  lative combination of degree d is defined as C = (G0, G1,  G , ?, G  d-1 ) with the combination index vector S = (0, 1,  2, ?, d  1). In this study, we examined different accu-  mulative combinations as discussed in Section 3.2. Other  combination types are also discussed in Section 3.6.

2.4. Construction of SVM classifiers  Each protein sequence in a dataset is transformed into  a vector C together with a label of ?+1? or ? 1?, for SVM  to distinguish two different classes, OM and NOM, re-  spectively. Giving these vectors to train the SVM, we can  obtain a model, i.e., a well-trained binary SVM classifier,  to determine whether an unknown protein sequence is an  OMP or not.

In Section 3.2, several SVM classifiers were con-  structed using different accumulative combination on  dataset 1 or dataset 2. In Section 3.3, a SVM classifier  was trained using dataset 1 for identifying OMPs in a  given set of Gram-negative bacterial proteins. In Section  3.4, a SVM classifier was trained using dataset 2 for dis-  criminating OMPs from proteins belonging to other struc-  tural classes.

3. Results and discussion  Our SVM classifiers were implemented using  LIBSVM [15] (available at http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/  ~cjlin/libsvm). Since Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel  has the best performance, we adopt it in this paper.

3.1. Performance measures and evaluation meth-  ods  3.1.1. Performance measures. In this paper, the preci-  sion, recall (the recall of OM class), and the recall of  NOM class is defined as follows.

Precision = TP / (TP + FP),  Recall = TP / (TP + FN),  The recall of NOM class = TN / (TN + FP),  where TP (FP) denotes the proteins which are predicted as  OM class and actually belong to OM (NOM) class, and  TN (FN) denotes the proteins which are predicted as  NOM class and actually belong to NOM (OM) class.

On the other hand, at Table 2, the recall of a specific  SCL or dual SCLs belonging to OM (NOM) class is de-  fined as TP / (TP + FN) ( TN / (TN + FP) ) with corre-  sponding TP and FN (TN and FP). At Table 3 and Table 5,  the recall of a specific structural class of globular proteins  is defined as TN / (TN + FP) with corresponding TN and  FP.

3.1.2. 5-Fold cross-validation. In this paper, the predic-  tion capability is evaluated by the 5-fold cross-validation,  where the SVM classifier is trained using a collection of  four subsets, and tested against the remaining subset. Af-  ter five rounds, the average performance is obtained by  Proceedings of the 5th IEEE Symposium on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering (BIBE?05)     averaging the performances of the five SVM models. In  each round, the best pair of SVM parameters C (a trade-  off between large margin and misclassification error) and  for the RBF kernel is decided by the 5-fold cross-  validation on the training data. The best parameter pair is  explored by the ?grid search? strategy suggested in the  user guide of LIBSVM. Instead of the highest overall ac-  curacy, (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FN + FP), the best pa-  rameter pair is selected according to the average of the  precision and recall in our implementation. The reason is  that our goal is to obtain a high recall with a high preci-  sion, not just a highest precision or recall. The 5-fold  cross-validation and parameter selection method were  used in all experiments in this paper except the compari-  son (shown in Table 5) of our method and the method  based on dipeptide composition.

3.1.3. Validity check procedure. Validity check proce-  dure was used by Gromiha et al. to evaluate their method  [8]. We used this procedure for comparison with their  method (See Section 3.5). The procedure is described as  follows. A dataset is randomly split into two subsets, set  A and set B, with approximately the same size. The pre-  diction model is developed with set A and then tested on  set B. The same procedure is repeated by using set B as  the training data and set A as the test data. After repeating  the procedure described above several times, the average  accuracy is obtained. Note that the optimal SVM parame-  ter pair is also determined according to the 5-fold cross-  validation on the training data.

3.2. Performances of different accumulative com-  binations  The performances of different accumulative combina-  tions on dataset 1 and dataset 2 are shown in Figure 1(a)  and Figure 1(b), respectively. The average of the preci-  sion and recall is also shown. Note that the number of  features increases 400 when a composition is accumulated.

In Figure 1(a), the precision reaches as high as 95.5%  with a recall of 92.4% when S = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). In Fig-  ure 1(b), there are two results with the highest average of  precision and recall. One is obtained by using the accu-  mulative combination with S = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) when the  precision is 96.3% and the recall is 96.0%. The other is  obtained by using the accumulative combination with  S = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) when the precision is 96.5% and the  recall is 95.8%.

On the other hand, the results in Figure 1(a) show that  the differences between the highest performance and the  lowest one are only 3.4% and 6.8% in precision and recall,  respectively. In Figure 1(b), the difference between the  highest and lowest performances is also small. However,  the number of features of the experiment of the highest  performance is two thousand more than the lowest one in  either Figure 1(a) or 1(b). The observation indicates that  the number of features affects the performances of SVM  classifiers slightly.

3.3. Discriminating OMPs from proteins with  other subcellular localizations  Figure 1(a) shows that the SVM classifier using the ac-  cumulative combination with S = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) per-  forms best. The precision, the recall of OM class, and the  recall of NOM class of the prediction result are 95.5%,  92.4% and 97.9%, respectively. Table 2 shows the TP, FN,  and recall of each SCL of the prediction result. As ob-  served in Table 2, the lowest recall falls on the dual SCLs  ?P/OM? because one of the only two protein sequences  Proceedings of the 5th IEEE Symposium on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering (BIBE?05)     annotated as ?P/OM? is incorrectly classified. Nonetheless,  the result is better than those of PSORTb where both of  the proteins were classified as neither ?P? nor ?OM?. Be-  sides this case, the recalls of all other SCLs are all over  90%. In the prediction result of NOM class, we observed  that the recalls are very high besides that of ?EC?. It indi-  cates that k-gapped amino acid pair compositions of pro-  teins annotated as having this SCL are more similar to  those of OMPs.

3.4. Discriminating OMPs from globular proteins  of four typical structural classes  An OMP is characterized by its distinct -barrel struc-  ture as well as its SCL (outer membrane). The -barrel  structure is formed from transmembrane -strands. The  physical properties of these strands are usually similar to  those of -strands in all-  globular proteins. Therefore,  all-  globular proteins are considered more difficult to  discriminate from OMPs than proteins with other struc-  tural classes. Here, we have examined the performance of  our method using dataset 2, consisting of 377 OMPs and  674 globular proteins belonging to four typical structural  classes.

Table 3 shows the result of the experiment using the  accumulative combination with S = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The  precision, recall of OMPs and recall of globular proteins  are 96.5%, 95.8% and 98.1%, respectively. The recalls of  the four classes of globular proteins are all higher than  96%. The highest recall, 99.4%, was obtained from all-  class, while the lowest recall, 96.8%, was from all-  class.

The difference between the highest and lowest recalls is  less than 3%. Especially, the recall of all-  globular pro-  teins is also high. The result indicates that our classifier  has approximately the same capability to exclude different  classes of globular proteins and that our classifier can  exclude all-  globular proteins with high recall.

3.5. Comparison with other methods  In this section, we show the comparisons of our  method and two recent reported methods, the frequent  subsequence based SVM method and the dipeptide com-  position based statistical method. The PSORTb v.2.0 pro-  gram [6] (briefly denoted as PSORTb in the following)  predicts 9 SCLs of Gram-negative or Gram-positive bac-  teria by 9 SVM classifiers, each of which independently  predicts whether or not a protein sequence is resident at a  specific SCL. One of the 9 SVM classifiers is the OMP  classifier. The classifier is based on the frequent subse-  quences extracted from OMP sequences. Each protein  sequence in their dataset was represented as a binary vec-  tor consisting of occurrences of these subsequences to  train the OMP classifier. In their experiments, different  numbers of frequent subsequences as well as various ker-  nel functions and SVM parameters were examined, and  the highest precision with a reasonable level of recall was  reported.

Table 4 shows the comparison of PSORTb and our  method using the same dataset (dataset 1). Using the ac-  cumulative combination with S = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) (d = 6),  the precision and recall of our method are 0.9% and 7.1%,  respectively, higher than those of PSORTb. Moreover, the  number of features used by our method is only about one-  twentieth that of PSORTb. Using the accumulative com-  bination with S = (0, 1) (d = 2), the more dramatic de-  crease in the number of features is observed relative to  PSORTb. At that time, the same precision as PSORTb is  maintained together with a 4.5% increase in recall. The  comparison shows that our method uses relatively rather  few features and achieves more high precision and better  recall of OMPs than PSORTb. It indicates that the combi-  nation of  k-gapped amino acid pair compositions capture more discriminative sequence information than the occur-  rences of frequent subsequences extracted only from  OMPs.

Gromiha et al. [8] developed a statistical method based  on weighted dipeptide composition to discriminate OMPs  from other proteins. Table 5 shows the comparison of our  method and the statistical method using the same dataset  (dataset 2) and evaluation method (validity check proce-  dure. See Section 3.1 for it). The non-gapped amino acid  pair composition (d = 1) was used because of the same  number of features as the dipeptide composition based  method. The result shows a dramatic increase of 17% in  the recall of globular proteins and only a 3% decrease in  the recall of OMPs relative to the statistical method. It  indicates that our SVM method based on non-gapped  amino acid pair composition outperforms the statistical  method based on dipeptide composition. Using the accu-  mulative combination with S = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) (d = 6),  we obtained the same recall of OMPs and a dramatic in-  crease of 18% in the recall of globular proteins relative to  the statistical method. On the other hand, the recalls of the  four structural classes are all higher than 93% (within  both d = 1 and d = 6). Especially, the recall of all-  globu-  lar proteins of our method achieves remarkable increase  of 26% compared to the statistical method. It shows the  outstanding capability of our method in distinguishing all-  globular proteins from -barrel membrane proteins. The  comparison shows that our method outperforms the statis-  tical method based on dipeptide composition.

3.6. Performance of each k-gapped amino acid  pair composition and other combinations  In this section, we have also evaluated the performance  of each k-gapped amino acid pair composition. The results  are shown in Figure 2. Based on some observation of  these results, several experiments with other combinations  are performed.

As observed in Figure 2(a), the performance of the  one-, two-, and five-gapped amino acid pair compositions  are better than others. Therefore, a SVM classifier was  constructed using a novel combination with S = (1, 2, 5),  consisting of these k-gapped amino acid pair compositions.

The result shows a precision of 95.0% with a recall of  91.5%. It shows 0.9% improvement in precision and the  same value of recall compared to the accumulative com-  bination with S = (0, 1, 2). Moreover, the average of the  precision and recall is over the accumulative combination  with S = (0, 1, 2, 3) and that with S = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4). How-  ever, the performance is worse than the best performed  accumulative combination with S = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). In-  terestingly, the precision and recall of the combination  with S = (1, 3, 5) are the same as that with S = (1, 2, 5).

As observed in Figure 2(b), the one-, three- and five-  gapped amino acid pair compositions perform better. Us-  ing the combination with S = (1, 3, 5), the performance  Proceedings of the 5th IEEE Symposium on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering (BIBE?05)     achieves a precision of 95.5% with a recall of 96.6%. It  shows a decrease of 0.5% in precision and an increase of  1.4% in recall compared to the accumulative combination  with S = (0, 1, 2). However, the performance is worse  than the best performed accumulative combination with  S = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). We also examined the combination  with S = (0, 2, 4). The performance achieves the precision  of 95.7% with a recall of 94.2%.

These experiments show that these k-gapped amino  acid pair compositions within a combination contain re-  dundant sequence order information and that the combina-  tion with S = (1, 3, 5) contains more discriminative se-  quence information to improve the prediction result. It  also indicates that one-, three- and five-gapped amino acid  pair compositions are meaningful for OMPs.

4. Conclusion  In this paper, we propose a method for discriminating  OMPs from other proteins by Support Vector Machines  using combinations of k-gapped amino acid pair composi-  tions. We analyzed the discriminative capability for dif-  ferent combinations of k-gapped amino acid pair composi-  tions. For dataset 1, the performance achieves a precision  of 95.5% with a recall of 92.4% when using the combina-  tion of k-gapped amino acid pair compositions with S = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). There are 0.9% and 7.1% increases in preci-  sion and recall, respectively, compared to the method  based on frequent subsequences. Furthermore, the number  of features is remarkably reduced in our method. It shows  that the combination of gapped amino acid pair composi-  tions can capture more discriminative sequence informa-  tion than frequent subsequences. For dataset 2, the results  showed that our method has approximately the same  power for discriminating OMPs from globular proteins  even in different structural classes and that our method is  much more powerful than the dipeptide based statistical  method for discriminating OMPs from all-  globular pro-  teins.

In this study, several combinations of k-gapped amino  acid pair compositions are demonstrated to contain valu-  able sequence information to discriminate OMPs from  other proteins. The results indicate that the combination of  one-, three- and five-gapped amino acid pair compositions  are more meaningful than other combinations for OMPs.

We believe that further study in the gapped amino acid  pair compositions will lead us to understand better the  structural regularity of the OMP sequences and biological  meanings behind the gapped amino acid pair composi-  tions. Moreover, the high precision and recall of the  OMPs as well as the high accuracy of excluding globular  proteins represent the potential for identifying OMPs en-  coded within the genome.
