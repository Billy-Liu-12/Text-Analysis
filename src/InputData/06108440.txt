An Application of Association Rule Mining Based on  Stock Market

Abstract- Stock trading is a popular approach for money  investment. This paper focuses on Thai stock market which has hundreds of individual stocks. The aim of this paper is to apply an association rule mining technique for discovering the relationships between individual stocks.  The transactional dataset used to generate the rules consists of 242 trading days from 4 January 2010 to 30 December 2010. The results from the discovered association rules can indicate the trends of related individual stocks. In addition, these rules may help beginner stock traders to preliminary select interesting stocks for further analysis.

I.    INTRODUCTION   Today, most people invest their money in stock trading especially for online trading.  There are many aspects on stock investment prominence. First, it doesn't need a lot of money to invest. If you have 10,000 Baht, you can trade a stock but cannot invest in gold or real estate. Second, it uses a short term to get a profit from stock trading may be on one day or a few days. In addition, a return value of stock investment is greater than an interest from bank saving. However, there is a high risk in stock investment if a trader does not have any knowledge about stocks in the market.

Currently there are two analysis methods for stock trading: fundamental and technical analyses [1].

Fundamental analysis focuses on the fundamental factors of an individual stock. This method is used to evaluate a circumstance of an individual company. There are two strategies of the evaluation: qualitative and quantitative analyses [1]. Qualitative analysis considers the organization of the company such as the management board of the company, the company?s size, the nature of the product, the diversification of the product, and economies of scale of the company. Quantitative analysis focuses on the financial statements of the company and transforms them into various measurements such as Earning per Share (EPS), the ratio of price and book value (P/BV), Return on Equity (ROE), and Return on Assets (ROA) [1].

Technical analysis uses the historical data of daily trading including stock prices and buying or selling stock volume to predict the trends of stock prices in the future presented by graphs. The examples of these graphs are Moving Average  Convergence Divergence (MACD), Exponential Moving Average (EMA), and Relative Strength Index (RSI) [1].

The objective of this paper is to propose an application of association rule mining for discovering the relationships between individual stocks based on Thai stock market. The advantage of this work is to preliminary help investors to find the interesting stocks for buying or selling.

The organization of this paper is as follows: Section II reviews the existing works applied on Thai stock market, Section III explains the theory of an association rule mining technique, Section IV describes the data preprocessing step of the application, Section V discusses about association rules for stock trading, and Section VI provides the conclusion of this work.



II. RELATED WORKS   There are many works applied data mining techniques for  Thailand stock market. All of these researches used various factors that influence the Thai stock market as the inputs of the models and predicted the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) index.

Rimcharoen et al. [2] proposed an adaptive evaluation strategy for predicting the SET index. This research used five indicators: the Dow Jones index, the Nikkei index, the Hong Seng index, the gold price and the Minimum Loan Rate (MLR) for formulating the function to predict the SET index.

Sutheebanjard and Premchaiswadi [3] applied the (1+1) evolution strategy to estimate the SET index by using four factors: the Down Jones index, the Nikkei index, the Hangseng index, and the MLR.

In 2008, Chaigusin et al. [4] build three models to predict the SET index based on feedforward backpropagation neural networks. This research compared the prediction performance of the three models: 3-layer, 4-layer, and 5-layer neural networks. The inputs of the models are same which consists of seven nodes: the SET index, the Dow Jones index, the Nikkei index, the Hang Seng index, the gold price, the MLR, and the exchange rates of the Thai Baht and the US dollar.

In 2010, Sutheebanjard and prechaiswadi [5] constructed the 3-layer neural networks to forecast the SET index. The number of input nodes is seven which are the SET index, the Dow Jones index, the Straits Times index, the Nikkei index, the Hang Seng index, the MLR, and the gold price.

As mention above, all of researches used various data mining techniques to predict the SET index only, none of  - 259 -    works provides the relationships between stocks. Since in Thai market, there are hundreds of individual stocks, it is important for stock investors to know which stocks are related in order to make a better decision to buy or sell suitable stocks. For this reason, this paper aims to discover the relationships between interesting stocks based on an association rule mining technique.



III. ASSOCIATION RULE MINING   Association rule mining is a useful technique for  discovering correlation among items. It was first introduced for market basket analysis [6]. Currently, there are many applications in various fields using association rule technique to extract information such as transportation [7], medical [8], traffic [9], web mining [10], sport [11, 12], and crime analysis [13].

Let I={i1,i2,?,i3} be a set of literals called items and let the database consist of a set of transactions. An association rule has the form X ? Y where X ? I, Y? I, and X?Y=?. X is called antecedence and Y is called consequence of the rule.

There are two important measures used to select the interesting association rules: support (sup) and confidence (conf). Support is the percentage of transactions containing both X and Y. Confidence is the percentage of transactions containing X that also contain Y.

A process of the association rule mining is generating all interesting rules that satisfy the user-specified minimum support (minsup) and minimum confidence (minconf). There are two steps in association rule mining. First, finding all frequent itemsets that satisfy minsup. Next, generating association rules from these frequent itemsets that satisfy minconf.

Sometimes a rule X?Y is considered to interesting with a high support and confidence, but this rule can be misleading since the occurrence of X does not imply the occurrence of Y.

Thus the correlation between itemsets X and Y will be considered. The measurement for evaluating an association rule based on the correlation is called the lift [14]. The lift of a rule X?Y can be computed by (1).

(1)  There are three types of the correlation from the lift value.

? If the                    , then the occurrence of X and Y are  negatively correlated.

? If the                    , then the occurrence of X and Y are  positively correlated.

? If the                     , then X and Y are independent.



IV.   DATA PREPROCESSING   The original datasets for generating the association rules were obtained from www.kimeng.co.th. These datasets are historical daily data covered the period from 4 January 2010 to 30 December 2010. An example of an original dataset is shown in Table 1.

Each dataset is represented to an individual stock, and a row of the dataset consists of nine columns including, date, daily opening, high, low, and closing price, change (means the difference of closing price between today and previous day), the percentage of change, trading volume, and trading value of that stock.

In data preprocessing step, the original data were transformed to the format of transactional data in order to find the association rules. An example of a transactional dataset is shown in Fig.1. Each transaction represents a daily trading information which containing all individual stocks which have risen or fallen more than or equal to a particular percentage over the previous day?s close. An individual stock is encoded by adding a letter ?i? or ?d? in front of a name of that stock.

For an example, ?iADVANC? (?dADVANC?) means today the price of the ADVANC stock rises (falls) when compared with yesterday.



V.   ASSOCIATION RULES FOR STOCK TRADING   In the experiments, three transactional datasets were  generated using three different values of the percentage of change: 1%, 2%, and 3%. After three transactional datasets were constructed, an association rule mining technique was applied to find the association rules separately for each dataset. For the support-confidence framework, the minsup was set to 10%, 5%, and 3% according to the datasets which have 1%, 2%, and 3% of change respectively. For the minconf, it was set to 100% for all datasets.

Table 2 shows the number of discovered association rules, the minimum and the maximum support value from all generated rules. The results reveal that when the percentage of change is set to high the generated rules will have low supports. In addition, there are a few rules can be found. On the contrary, if the percentage of change is set to low i.e. 1%, the discovered rules will have higher supports. This is because  TABLE I. THE ORIGINAL DATASET OF THE ADVANC STOCK     Fig.1. The transactional dataset  )()( )(  YPXP YXPlift YX  ? ??  1	?YXlift  ?YXlift  1??YXlift  - 260 -     in a real dataset, the individual stocks (items) which have risen/fallen more than or equal to 3% are rarely appeared in a transaction. Thus the minsup should be set to a low value (minsup=3%) in order to prevent the problem of finding none of rule.

The top five association rules ranked by the lift, the supports and the lifts of the rules for each dataset (a group of the percentage of change) are summarized in Table 3. The sets of association rules from Table 3 indicate the relationship among the trend of individual stock values. These sets of rule are different depended on the dataset and the minsup.

The rule {iKEST, iAMATA} ? iASP means if the KEST and the AMATA increase more than 3%, then the ASP will rise more than 3% too. The discovered rules may help stock investors to make a decision which stocks should buy or sell together. Furthermore, these rules may use to predict a trend of an interested stock (stock appeared in a consequence of a rule) by considering the rule that has an antecedent set of stock matching to a current situation of stock market.

Since there are three difference sets of association rules according to a certain percentage of change of a stock price, in practice, stock traders should select an interesting rule from a group of an acceptable price change. As an example, if an investor aims to buy or sell a stock when a stock price is changed more than or equal to 2% the investors should consider the rules in a group of 2% of change.



VI.   CONCLUSION   This paper applied an association rule mining technique to discover the relationship between a set of individual stocks. In the data preprocessing step, a percentage of change of each stock was considered to eliminate the stock which has a percentage of change smaller than a specified value. In the experiment, three transactional datasets of 242 trading days were used to find the sets of association rules with three specified minsup values and 100% of minconf.

In conclusion, this application helps beginner stock traders to recommend interesting stocks by using the set of generated association rules. Furthermore, the rule can predict a trend of a consequence stock related to the stocks appeared in an antecedence of the rule. However this application can suggest some interesting stocks and a trend to buy or sell for that stock, it should be better if stock investors consider this information together with the other factors such as the SET index, a fundamental of an interested stock, or technical graphs in order to make a final decision for buying or selling a good stock.
