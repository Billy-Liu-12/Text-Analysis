Conserved Domain Combination Identification in Human Proteins

Abstract  In this paper, we propose a method for the analysis of conservation of domain combinations in proteins. Using the method, we extract conserved domain combinations in Homo sapience proteome and examine their GO term anno- tations in order to understand the co-evolution of domains in a proteome. Unlike conventional methods, which use co- occurrence frequency for evolutionary analysis of domains, the proposed method measures mutual dependency of do- mains in proteins as well. According to the results, domains in Homo sapience proteome turn out to form patterns whose members are highly affiliated to one another. Besides, GO term analysis shows that extracted patterns have a tendency of being associated with molecular functions, and molecu- lar functions are more related with mutual dependency than co-occurrence frequency of domains. Those results indi- cate that the proposed method adopting mutual dependency outperforms conventional methods in terms of finding do- main combinations conserved through evolution for molec- ular functional collaboration.

1 Introduction  Domain is a conserved unit of compact three- dimensional structure and evolution [13], which carries spe- cific function [14]. As conserved functional units, domains offer an abstract level at which the protein may be stud- ied [10], so the detection of domains is one of the first steps toward assigning functions to a protein. Therefore, domain- based protein function annotation resources are getting pop- ular these days [6], and accumulated domain resources are widely utilized in laboratory and computational methods for protein function discovery. [11].

Although a domain has its own function, the function of a domain should be considered in association with neigh-  ?Corresponding author: School of Engineering, Information and Com- munications University P.O.Box 77, Yusong, Daejeon 305-600, Korea (telephone: +82-042-866-6290; e-mail: dshan@icu.ac.kr)  bor domains due to environmental sensitivity of polypep- tide chain. Actually, neighbor domains are one of the most influential circumstances for the domain folding and func- tion, and its experimental evidences were reported in several genes. Domains in a protein might have relationship called domain interplay [17] or intra-domain communication [3].

A domain might indirectly influences on neighbor domains in a protein [3] [17], explicitly takes a role in enhancing, repressing or stabilizing the functions of neighbors [4], or strengthen target function with neighbors playing the same functional role [9]. With this conception, several research groups started to use the notion of domain combination in protein function prediction methods considering neighbor effect [12] [15], so that they obtained relatively good results.

Therefore considering a protein just as a set of domains and studying each domain independently might bring improper results in the study of protein function.

When we consider that proteins have evolved toward specific functions, a domain may appear in association with other domains which have significant effects on the aimed functions. If so, those co-appearing domains in a protein, a domain combination, must be conserved through protein evolution for functional interplay. Several researches clue us on conserved domain combination phenomena in vari- ous way, co-occurrence and domain assembling versatility, and give some evidences supporting the notion of conserved domain combination [2] [19]. However none of those eluci- dates the phenomena of conserved domain combination, as they mainly explain only the master and servant relationship between two domains . They limit the number of domains in combinations, and domain assembling versatility or as- sociation is measured based on an interesting domain but not on all of members in a combination. Besides, biological analysis is not sufficient due to the manual inspection.

For the study of the conservation of domain combination, a systematic method needs to be devised to measure the con- servation degree of each domain combination. Usually, pro- tein sequence conservation has been evaluated by sequence alignment. Domain combination conservation should be evaluated in the similar manner as well, yet also the rela-   DOI 10.1109/WAINA.2008.228    DOI 10.1109/WAINA.2008.228     tionships of domains in a combination should be consid- ered.

In this paper, we fortify the notion of domain combi- nation by identifying conserved domain combinations and analyzing functional relations among domains in a com- bination. First, we develop a quantitative method for the analysis of conservation of domain combination as apply- ing two concepts of association rule learning technique that is widely used in data mining and treatment leaning. The method measures mutual dependency between domains and co-occurrence frequency in a proteome. Unlike other previ- ous researches, it systematically evaluates the significance of each domain combination in terms of conservation, ir- respective of the number of members, versatility, and their continuity.

The term of support denotes domain?s co-occurrence fre- quency, and all-confidence denotes the mutual dependency in a combination, respectively; support, and all-confidence are the terms used in association rules in general. The term of domain pattern is coined to denote a domain com- bination that is regarded to be highly conserved through evolution. A domain pattern miner algorithm extracts do- main patterns using predefined minimum support and all- confidence threshold.

From the experiments, we used record from UniProt Knowledgebase [7] (release 9.3) and refined them against InterPro [6] domain information (release 13.1). Domain pattern miner has extracted 681 domain patterns from 39,563 Homo sapience (human) proteins. Four fifth of hu- man proteins have one or more domain patterns.

In order to elucidate biological roles or members? coop- erations of conserved domain combinations, we have ana- lyzed domain patterns based on Gene Ontology (GO) terms annotated to each domain [5]. The GO term analysis re- veals that domains in a pattern have a tendency of having functional similarity, which obeys our assumption about domains? cooperation in conserved domain combination.

Also, it is revealed that all-confidence have higher corre- lation with functional similarity than support does; support is conventionally used for conserved domain combination identification. These facts indicate that the strategy adopt- ing mutual dependency outperforms methods using only co- occurrence frequency in identifying domain combinations contributing to the same function. Besides, The comparison among the results of analysis on three GO term categories shows that the domain patterns are correlative with molecu- lar function but not with biological process or cellular com- ponent. Therefore, we conclude that the conserved domain combination is the team for molecular functional collabo- ration and the collaboration is one of the reasons why the combination have been assembled through the evolution.

2 Materials and Methods  2.1 Conserved Domain Combination Cri- teria  From proteins in an organism, we can extract huge amount of domain combination which may or may not have biological meaning. Domain combinations, appearing in several proteins within a genome, are likely to have evolved by gene duplication, so those are the result of evolutionary conservation of domains for some biological and functional advantage. Therefore, like the definition of conservation se- quences, frequently found identical domain combination in an organism should be regarded as conserved and signifi- cant assembly.

In nature, several domains are abundant like as Ki- nase [18]. Proteins, what abundant domain belongs to, would generate a frequent domain combination having abundant domain. Therefore this frequent combination, caused by member?s abundance, is not necessarily mean- ingful, and association analysis can overcome this problem.

Conserved domain combination may comprise domains that carry some biological meaning by members? interplay, thus the association characteristics of domains should be understood. A domain has chemical and physical feature, so its roles in domain interplay are limited, and the domain would appear only in combinations in what it can take a role for target functions. Therefore the members of conserved combination should have dependencies on each other mem- bers. Also the dependency should be mutual since abundant domains compel dependency from minor domains. If every domain is mutually dependent on one another in the same combination, then we can say the combination is significant and conserved.

2.2 Domain Pattern Mining  Conserved domain combination is easily identified as domain pattern with data mining technique that fulfills two criteria, frequency and mutual dependency. We utilized two concepts in association rule running technique, support and all-confidence. Association rule running is widely used in the field of data mining and can represent significance and the strength of the itemset within the entire data. The no- tion support denotes the number of transactions that sup- port an itemset [1]. Support for an itemset is defined as, in given transaction set, the fraction of transactions that con- tains all items of given itemset. In the case of this research, the item is domain, the itemset is given domain combina- tion and the transaction is protein. As support counts the fraction of itemset, it is surely applicable to evaluate how frequently a domain combination occurs or domains occur together. Support corresponds to statistical significance, so     motivation for support constraint comes from the fact that we are interested only in frequent appearing domain combi- nation above predefined minimum support. If the support of a domain combination is not large enough, the combination is not thought to be conserved and not worth consideration.

Definition 1 Support of dc, a domain combination, is  supp(dc) = |{p|p ? P ? dc ? p}|  |P | where p is a protein in proteome P  Confidence measures the strength of association within itemset [1]. In the context of proteins and domains, an asso- ciation rule is of the form X ? Y, which means the presence of domain set X implies the presence of domain set Y in the same protein. The confidence of the association rule X ? Y is written as conf( X ? Y ) as defined by Definition 2.

Definition 2 Confidence of X ? Y is  conf(X ? Y ) = |{p|p ? P ? X ? Y ? p}||{p|p ? P ? X ? p}| All-confidence is a measure of the interestingness of an  association, whose result value can be regarded as a de- gree of mutual dependency within an itemset [16]. All- confidence value is the minimum of the confidence values of all rules that can be produced from target itemset. Also, with the predefined minimum threshold, an association is deemed interesting if it has an All-confidence greater than threshold. This indicates that there is a dependency among all of the items in the association.

Since basic confidence is measured with prior antecedent condition and item orientation, it could not applicable for domain combination when we are not interested in certain domain in a combination. In contrast to the confidence, all- confidence is useful measure of mutual dependency within an itemset regardless of orientation of items. Therefore it can surely be applied to measuring the strength of the do- main combination.

Definition 3 The all-confidence of a domain combination, dc, is  all ? conf(dc) = |{p|p ? P ? dc ? p}|  MAX{i|?l(l ? PowerSet(dc) ? l ?= ?? l ?= dc ? i = |{p|p ? P ? l ? p}|)}  Domains in a conserved domain combination should be associated with and dependent on one another, also they should be co-occurred frequently. Therefore domain  pattern mining with predefined minimum support and all- confidence thresholds must be promising for conserved do- main combination identification.

Even though a domain combination has values that ex- ceed predefined constraints of support and all-confidence , it could be useless as a domain pattern. Some domain com- bination has superset with the same support , and that means the subset occurs only when the superset does. In that case, subset has no meaning, or we can not measure the meaning of subset with given protein data. Therefore, those domain combinations should be trimmed before observing support and all-confidence. These characteristic is defined as maxi- mal property and used to define domain pattern.

Definition 4 A domain combination X has maximal prop- erty if no superset of this combination has the same or greater support.

Definition 5 A domain combination X is a domain pattern if it has maximal property, and supp(X) > sc all-conf(X) > ac where sc and ac are predefined minimum thresholds.

According to predefined minimum support and all- confidence thresholds, of course, various domain pattern sets could be defined. Therefore minimum support and all- confidence threshold should be defined after examining the characteristic of target organism or protein set.

2.3 Functional Analysis of Domain Com- bination  We introduce our strategy to measure functional similar- ity among given domain combination exploiting GO term information annotated to each member domain. In this re- search, we use a term, Internal Function Similarity( IFS), denoting whether members of a domain combination are devoting the similar function or not.

GO is the ontology for the feature of the gene products.

GO is a set of structured vocabularies organized in a rooted directed acyclic graph (DAG), describing attributes of pro- teins, domains or RNA in three categories of cellular com- ponent, biological process and molecular function. Each of GO categories should be analyzed respectively as they have different biological meaning.

The functional similarity of two GO terms must be con- sidered with hierarchical manner as GO is ontology. There- fore, we adopted FuSSiMeG function [8] to investigate sim- ilarity of two GO terms. FuSSiMeG, which is a tool com- puting the semantic similarity between two GO terms, ex- ploits Jiang and Conrath?s semantic similarity measure that provides the best result overall [8].

Since FuSSiMeG generates similarity value for two GO terms, it should be extended into IFS for observing func- tional relationship of multiple GO terms annotated domain     Table 1.

In a nutshell, IFS is the average of FuSSiMeg values of possible GO term pairs of a domain combination.

First of all, all domain combi- nations in human proteome were evaluated by proposed method. Then we investigated relations between measured values and functional features of each domain combination.

Finally, we approved parts of domain combination as do- main pattern, then analyze its functional features.

3.1 Domain Pattern Candidates  We used 70,490 human proteins recorded in UniProt Knowledgebase [7](release 9.3), and it was filtered against InterPro [6](release 13.1) domain information. Information of used data is shown in Table 1.

First, we generated 4,984,605 domain combinations that is found from at least one protein in human proteins. Pattern candidates were also generated applying maximal property, and it was revealed that only 3,593 maximal combinations are remained from 4,984,605 domain combination. That dramatic decrease of domain combination is an evidence that multi-domain proteins were assembled from existing combinations of domains with limited repertoire. Using 3,593 maximal combinations, we can form any human pro- teins, so the maximal domain combination is another type of the unit of the protein.

Figure 1. Average IFS for Molecular Function against all-confidence  Figure 2. Average IFS for Molecular Function against support  3.2 IFS Tendency  Using generated maximal domain combination, we in- vestigated functional similarity tendency of domain mem- bers in a combination according to support and all- confidence values. We applied functional similarity mea- sure IFS, and IFS were performed for three GO term cat- egories respectively. Since GO term information is insuf- ficient, only parts of domain combinations are measurable (Table 2).

Table 2 contains the numerical correlation values for each cases calculated using Pearson?s correlation test. The correlation coefficient between molecular function and all- confidence is 0.376, and the one with support is 0.250.

Therefore we can say that IFS of molecular function is more related with all-confidence than support . As significant val- ues p for correlation coefficients of molecular function are 0, which are smaller than significant level 0.01, the correla- tion coefficients calculated are statistically acceptable.

However the correlations for biological process and cel- lular component could not be comparable since correlation coefficient with support are not statistically accepted be- cause of the significant value p which is grater than signifi- cant level 0.01.

Figure 1 plots the relationship between all-confidence and average IFS in the aspect of molecular function cate- gory. As the line go upward, the graph shows that aver- age IFS has upward tendency vividly as all-confidence get-     Table 2.

If we compare that with the Figure 2, it becomes obvious that average IFS of domain pattern can- didates for molecular function is related to all-confidence rather than to support. The line is fluctuated in high support region of the graph Figure 2 which plot the relationship be- tween support and average IFS. When the number of the oc- currence is relatively small, IFS line seems to be increased against support. However, upward tendency of IFS is disap- peared and seems not to be stable where the number of the occurrence is more than a hundred.

As, conventionally, conserved sequence has been re- garded having significant function, domain patterns with high support and all-confidence are also expected to have functional significance. Moreover, functional tendency is more related to all-confidence than support , which implies that proposed approach adopting all-confidence is more promising to identify conserved domain combination.

3.3 Domain Pattern in Human Protein  The next step of domain pattern inference should be de- termining minimum support sc and all-confidence threshold ac. Those constraints let us specify conservation degree of domain patterns. sc and ac could be determined arbitrary, but it is recommended to choose them after observation of data. To obtain biologically meaningful and enough domain pattern, we choose 0.2 for all-confidence threshold ac and 0.0003 for minimum support sc after observing data distri- butions. With specified sc and ac, domain pattern miner generated 681 domain patterns from 3,593 maximal combi- nations in Human proteins. Those obtained patterns cover 32172 proteins among 39563 given proteins.

Now domain pattern candidates, which are domain com- binations having maximal property, were categorized two groups, Pattern and None groups. Those groups should have biological differences if our domain pattern inferring method worked well. We analyzed IFS for each domain pat- tern in Pattern group and each of None group. Due to lack of GO term information, We approve combination to mea- sure IFS if more than four fifth of domains have GO terms.

The result is shown as a box plot in Figure 3. For molec-  ular function, domain pattern candidates seem to be catego- rized well. The median of Pattern group is 100 while the one of None group is around 40. However, IFS values of group None are not regular. It might be caused by prede- fined thresholds or lacks of human protein data.

For biological process, the IFS of Pattern and None groups are not surely distinguished. the of Pattern is 100, but third and fourth quartiles of Pattern are below the me- dian of None. For cellular component, Pattern and None group rarely have differences almost all of IFS are ranked at 100 except few extremal values.

We reserved the results of T-Tests of Pattern and None groups in each aspect of three GO term categories for neu- tralization of the differences between them. Since only sig- nificant value of molecular function is smaller than 0.01, the differences between Pattern and None for molecular func- tion are statically proved. Therefore, domain patterns ob- tained, which is categorized in Pattern, would surely be more molecular functionally similar within members than domain combination that were not recognized as domain patterns. The power of domain pattern approach seems to work mainly on GO term category molecular function.

From those results, we can infer that conserved domain combination takes roles of small functions like molecular function rather than cellular component.

4 Conclusion  In this research, we developed a systematic method for identifying conserved domain combination in human pro- teins using support and all-confidence. Proposed method enables us to explain the domain combination conserva- tion quantitatively, so domain combinations can be listed or sorted according to their values.

Using the method, we studied domain combinations by measuring conservation degrees and analyzing functional relation among domains in a combination. We obtained 681 conserved domain combinations, defined as domain pat-     Figure 3. IFS Distribution for Pattern and None groups  terns, whose members frequently appear together and are mutually dependent on one another. The analysis applying IFS (Inner Functional Similarity) measurement shows that domain patterns have correlation with molecular function of GO term category. The results explain one of the rea- sons why conserved domain combinations were assembled through protein evolution; that is, domains form a team for constructing specific molecular function when the function require collaboration among domains. Also, the results sup- port that proposed method exceeds conventional methods in identifying conserved domain combinations in which mem- bers contribute to constructing target function. This is be- cause the method employ mutual dependency of domains within combination in measuring conservation degree.

Consequently, when looking at molecular function of proteins, investigation of domain combination deserves to be considered rather than examining single domain sepa- rately. Besides, well filtered domain patterns can provide clues in various biological findings such as functional pre- diction or domain interplay discovery.
