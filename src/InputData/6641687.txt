The Role of Text Mining of Patent in Mergers and Acquisitions

Abstract--Technology strategy plays an increasingly  important role in today?s Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) activity, especially that aiming to obtain key technology capabilities. A big challenge that faces corporate managers and government policy makers is how to bring technology development prospects into play in order to help enterprises complement and strengthen their advantages. In this study, based on text mining of patents, we devise a method for extracting technology intelligence to facilitate M&A, focusing on potential targets by assessing technological synergy value for a firm. We present results pertaining to technology M&A in the field of numerical control systems in China.



I. INTRODUCTION  Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) [1,2,3]continue to be a  hot topic. By their very nature, M&A provide an effective way to obtain valuable resources, immediate access to products, distribution channels, and favorable market positions, thus functioning as an external source of innovation [4,5]. In terms of valuable resources, M&A decision-making tends to be dominated by financial and business managers. Few studies have tackled M&A from a technology analysis perspective [6]. Often the involvement of technology managers in M&A practices tends to be limited to the due diligence and post-acquisition management stages and, even here, those responsible for technology may often be utilized as narrow technical specialists rather than in order to provide an overview of technology strategy and management issues [7].

Having just non-technical personnel handling M&A appears to have a negative impact on the acquiring firm?s post-M&A innovative performance [8]. Researchers emphasize the important role of integrating technology issues into M&A decision making?among other reasons in order to avoid costly errors and reduce the failure rate, but also to enable acquirers to better realize value from new technological assets [9]. M&A can enable acquirers to replenish their research pipelines [10], to pre-empt competition in technology markets [11], to gain control of technology critical to the competitors? current products and future product development strategy [12], and to acquire targeted innovations [13].

At present, the literature on ?tech M&A? addresses two parts of the process. Most studies have focused on post-acquisition integration. Some are evaluative: Miozzo researched what happens to the technological resources and assets of host country science-based firms when they are acquired by foreign firms [14];Cloodt argued that how the  acquired and acquiring firms? knowledge bases relate to each other impacts the acquiring firm?s innovative performance in a curvilinear fashion, indicating that companies should target M&A partners that are neither too unrelated nor too similar in terms of their knowledge base [15]. Some studies have emphasized the challenges and problems of the post-acquisition integration process [16, 17]. Studies that have presented models from pre-acquisition stage are very sparse. Andreas et al. [18] suggested that direct pre-acquisition alliances as well as sector familiarity between the acquirer and the target are important because they facilitate and speed up post-acquisition integration.

Considering the low proportion of successful M&A cases, research tends more often to trace reasons for integration failure retrospectively [19], looking into the pre-acquisition stage, specifically at the selection of the M&A target, which is when technology development intelligence may be brought into play to help enterprises complement their advantages and strengthen themselves .

Taking advantage of Scientific and Technological (S&T) data can help to match up two companies with complementary technologies. Jaffe [20] suggested that the aggregate citation flows can be used as proxies for knowledge-spillover intensity. Acquirer and target citing each other?s patents suggests that the merged firm could internalize the knowledge spillover created by their constituent companies. James [7] identified several dimensions of technological synergy between acquirers and targets, constructed from patent portfolio data.  In this study, we seek to devise an effective method to help extract technology intelligence to facilitate M&A.



II. CHALLENGES IN PRE-TECH M&A ANALYSIS  The pre-acquisitions stage, especially the tech M&A  target selection, represents the most important part of all M&A activities. A big challenge that faces corporate managers and government policy makers is how to bring technology development prospects into play in order to help enterprises complement and strengthen their advantages.

We start our research based on the following driving questions: 1. How can one identify the M&A target candidate?s  technology pool, meaning how does one determine the tech M&A strategy?

2. How can more quantitative analysis be involved to support the decision?

2013 Proceedings of PICMET '13: Technology Management for Emerging Technologies.

3. How can technology synergy between the target and the given company be measured?

In this study, based on text mining of patents, we devise a  method for extracting technology intelligence to facilitate M&A, focusing on potential targets by assessing technological synergy values for a firm. Figure 1 shows the process.

Step 1: Strategy Analysis -- The purpose of this step is to determine the technology M&A strategy for the given company, which could ensure that the company steps into or maintains a leadership position over the next few years in the relevant technologies. First, technology forecasting is used to grasp the technology status and project development trends for key candidate technologies. Second, the particular  company could be compared with top global players to identify its technology (dis)advantages and then develop a strategic technology plan.

Step 2: Synergy Analysis -- Based on the information relating to key target technologies derived from Step 1, we set up the patent databases for the target selection. First, we need to decide upon the scope for the M&A, whether we want to consider national or transnational activities. Second, we identify the patent owners for the key technologies. Third, we measure the degree of technological synergy (including the similarity of technologies and their complementarity) to look for adequate technology acquisition candidates based on patent datasets designed to orient the firm?s technology M&A strategy.

III. METHODS  In this study, we try to discover tech M&A target  candidates for a Chinese company in the field of Numerical Control Systems (NCS), focusing on opportunities within China.  We develop datasets of patents and publications related to NCS. Patents for NCS are selected from the European Patent Office (EPO) in 2012, and represent the time period 1990?2010. As patents require an application period of 18 months, we haven?t included 2011 data in our research.

Publications on NCS are drawn from the Web of Science?s Science Citation Index (SCI) in 2012, and represent the time period 1990?2010. In all, analysis is based on 12,620 publications and 45,764 patents. All the patents have been granted; so they convey a sense of which types of commercial activities, with which companies, are involved.

M&A has gained importance as a strategy for enterprise development. Because of the high speed of S&T development, many enterprises choose to acquire a company to obtain new technology. We suppose that investigating the technological synergy between the acquirer and the target can improve the possibility of success. In this paper, we study the global NCS-related technology and forecast the development prospects for NCS by looking for technology acquisition candidates. We structure the research into the following steps: (1) First, we analyze the global development of NCS-related  technology. Through studying patents and publications, we identify the high-yield countries and their foci. We consider the difference between theoretical studies and applied research. Furthermore, we list the top 10 organizations in this field. All in all, this step leads us to forecast developmental trends for key candidate NCS technologies and identify some emerging technologies.

(2) Second, we focus on a company that is a leader globally.

During step 1, we list the companies that are leading the  industry. We then choose two companies and studied their strengths among the competition. In this paper, we decide upon the top company in China, SHENYANG MACHINE TOOL CO., LTD (SMTCL) to serve as an example. By comparing 3 companies, we determine SMTCL?s weaknesses in comparison with the competition.

(3) Third, we look for technology acquisition candidates. To compensate for the disadvantages we have revealed, SMTCL can acquire a company to obtain the technology or patents that it lacks. We select matching patents from the State Intellectual Property Office of the People?s Republic of China (SIPO) and extract a list of companies that possess the specific patents that match SMTCL?s weakness. By measuring the technology synergy, we reveal some acquisition candidates for SMTCL.



IV. RESULTS   A. Trends  Our analysis begin by examining the trajectory of NCS patents and publications from 2000 to 2010. From Fig.2 we can conclude that the growth trend can be divided into three stages: during the first stage, from 1990 to 1997,a small number of patents appear, and then from 1998, the number begins to grow steadily. Since the time of the recent major breakthroughs in NCS in 2006, NCS has attracted considerable attention; accordingly, the number of related patents has seen rapid growth. A steep incline in patent grants occurs from this year forward, and the number continues to increase through 2010. Comparatively speaking, the WOS trend line shows a stable climb rather than a sharp increase.

The focus of this research is on patenting activity and publications in the domain of NCS. From the foregoing observations, we can easily conclude that NCS has become a global patenting hotspot in recent years.

In order to profile the relationships among clusters in NCS research activities, we analyze the country correlation characteristics of NCS patents and their respective research topics. Fig. 3, generated by keywords of patent data, indicates two clusters ? one centers on Japan and the United States, including Canada, Italy, the UK, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Taiwan. The other centers on Germany, France, Austria, Russia, and so on. In our bibliometric analysis, we find the key words for the USA to be ?compensation,? ?feed forward,? and ?motor,? whereas the key words for Japan are ?recording medium,? ? signal,? and ?adaptive control?; finally, the key words for Germany are ?PLC,??automation system,? and ?interpolation.? We observe that different clusters have different research foci, but countries in the same group are related to each other, and the thicker the line is, the closer they are related. While China is geographically far away from the other countries in its group, it has a comparatively faint relationship with Japan and Taiwan; in these relationships, the key words are ?control,??signal,? and ?compatibility,? which are different from other countries and do not represent core NCS technology.

Fig. 4, generated by the keywords of publication data, depicts the quantity and correlation of keywords of NCS publications. The figure further shows that the keywords in the field of CNC machine tools are divided into three group:   Group 1 based on control, includes optimal control (77),  feedback control (83), closed-loop control (309), open-loop control (490), numerical simulation (243), control algorithm (96), and control system (222);  Group 2 is about machines consisting of cutting tool (167), machine tool (303), CNC machine (285), spindle speed (70), surface roughness (96), tool wear (74), the tool path (218), and process planning (81);  Group 3 surrounds high speed (94),high accuracy (68), and CNC system (95).

Overall, the theme of publications in the field of NCS technology has developed in three directions, but the different groups are still closely linked. Fig. 4 suggests that keyword nodes are more concentrated on the control system.

Therefore, we conclude that the research on NCS is highly related.

Fig. 4. Correlation of NCS publication Themes and Keywords  B. Top applicants in the recent 5 years  From Fig. 3, we have already seen that Japan, the USA, and Germany are the three top countries in the field of NCS globally. We explore active corporations, both in terms of generating NCS patents and publications, with the top ones listed in Table 1. The table further shows to which country the corporations and research institutes belong. We observe that the top patent applicants are mainly German and  Japanese corporations, including SIEMENS, MITSUBISHI ELECTRIC, FANUC, MATSUSHITA, and FUJITSU, among others. And moreover, we find that the top publishing institutions are mainly from China and the USA, while one Korean and one Indian institution also make the list.

Comparing the first and third columns, we discover that the lists are completely different. However, this divergence is logical since patents and publications are different in nature.

Of course, we need to remain aware that companies differ widely in their policies toward publication. For China, although research institutions are active in the publications, only one corporation is among the top patent applicants.

C. Leading company analysis  Among the top 10 patent applicants around the world,7 of them are Japanese. Hence we establish that Japanese corporations are powerful in the field of NCS. Therefore, we first choose two of them: FANUC and MITSUBISHI ELECTRIC as our main object of study to help benchmark Chinese corporations. Fig. 5 shows the growing tendencies of patent applications for the two corporations. We see that the trends of the two corporations resemble each other in general, but not in some specific years. Generally, an increasing trend can be observed that intensifies from 2008 onward.

We further analyze the patents submitted by FANUC and MITSUBISHI. Based on the international patent classification (IPC) system, we list the top 10 IPCs of these two corporations. Fig.6 shows that the top IPCs for FANUC  areG05B19, G06F19, B29C45, and B23Q15. For MITSUBISHI they are G05B19, G06Q50, and G06F17.

Comparing the two corporations, we conclude that both mainly focus on G05B, which is about numerical control systems, a core technology in the NCS machine tool industry.

Table 2 defines key IPCs for NCS.

Finally, we examine the patent data from SMTCL drawn from SIPO. Fig. 7 shows the growth trend for the patents and their IPC constitution. Comparing SMTCL?s growth tendency and IPC constitution with FANUC?s and MITSUBISHI?s, we find SMTCL did not apply for its first patent until nearly 9 years later than FANUC and MITSUBISHI; also, SMTCL is focused on IPC B23Q, while  the IPC constitution of FANUC and MITSUBISHI is more varied, and G05B19ranks first in quantity . From Table 2, we obtain the IPC definitions for FANUC?s and MITSUBISHI?s main patents. In summary, SMTCL?s weakness is G05B19?the numerical control system, especially interpolation, the programmable controller, PLC, compensation and compatibility.

D. Technology acquisition candidates SMTCL, established in 1993, is the biggest machine tool  manufacturer in the world. From 2000 to 2004 the company was in its rapid growth period. It became one of the top 15international machine tool companies about 2003. Then it began to acquire other companies. The first target was German -- SCHIESS. After a series of M&A activities, it rose to the top 10 companies in the world in 2007. It has successfully transformed itself into an international enterprise. In 2010, SMTCL has turned out to be the biggest machine tool manufacturer in the world.

Fig. 8 shows the history of SMTCL?s M&A events. Each M&A activity brings in more patents and business income.

We believe that M&A has helped SMTCL to obtain technology very quickly, which has strengthened its rise to the number 1 in the world.

Although SMTCL is number 1 globally now, that doesn?t mean that its technology is highly advanced in the world. As we observed in part A, Japan, the USA, and Germany are most actively patenting core NCS technology. China has had a large number of patents, but the correlation with other countries? areas of emphasis is weak. The most important part of a machine tool is its numerical control system. In part C  (Leading company analysis), we compare SMTCL with FANUC & MITSUBISHI. We find that SMTCL?s research focus is very different from that of the other two companies.

In fact, a considerable gap in the development of numerical control systems can be seen between SMTCL and FANUC & MITSUBISHI. We suggest that SMTCL ought to pay more attention to the emerging technology of NCS, or it could be outpaced by other companies.

There are many ways to obtain an emerging technology.

Considering SMTCL?s actual situation, we believe that M&A is the better way for them to obtain emerging technology capabilities quickly. Many companies are developing numerical control systems in China. We have to select candidates from hundreds of companies. In part C, we point out the weaknesses of SMTCL. According to the key technology area patents that SMTCL lacks, we develop a new search strategy. Then we use that to download patents from SIPO representing the period 1990?2010. The search yields 20960 patents in total.

The 20,960 patents represent more than 100 organizations.

However, we are really interested in a smaller group of organizations. To identify the target companies from these organizations, we develop a patent filter. We derive from part        Fig. 8. SMTCL: History of M&A events    2013 Proceedings of PICMET '13: Technology Management for Emerging Technologies.

C that SMTCL lacks patents belonging to the IPC classification G05B. Accordingly, we pick out the companies that have applied for patents in the G05B classification. We obtain a list containing10 companies. We then analyze the patent portfolios of these potential candidates using a number of metrics. A summary of the patent analysis metrics is shown in Table 3.

The first metric is whether the company has applied for more than one patent in the past years since the company was established. The second metric examines whether the company has applied for at least one patent each year in the recent three years from 2008 to 2010. This can enable us to make sure the company is continuously and currently involved in innovative research. The third metric involves the legal status of the patent. Once a patent is granted, that means that it is valuable, and the technology is useful. The fourth metric identifies whether a company has applied for the same patent in another country. The fifth metric indicates whether a company produces any emerging technologies. This can help us to identify whether a company is actively deploying new technology.

Companies whose patents meet at least three of the conditions outlined above are regarded as good candidates.

Table 3 shows that Dalian Guangyang, LT-CNC, and Shenyang Institute of Computing Technology Co., Ltd, are the most attractive acquisition targets, based on patent analysis.

We know that the success rate of M&A is not very high in general. One of the reasons may be that the necessity for knowledge relatedness between the acquiring and acquired companies has not been fully assessed. This concept of knowledge relatedness has been typically equated with knowledge similarity and complementarity. If company A acquires company B, whose knowledge background is totally different from A?s, the M&A could result ina disaster after acquisition because this mismatch complicates the integration process for both companies, and staff have to learn a lot of new things. Sometimes, in these cases, the M&A results in failure. If company A acquires company B with an identical knowledge background, this will cause a lot of redundancies and waste a lot of resources.

In general, knowledge relatedness includes science relatedness and technology relatedness. In this context, ?science? refers to the publications and ?technology? refers to the patents. Here we only discuss technology relatedness as the particular candidates in our example have few publications that can support our research about science relatedness. Technology relatedness involves technology similarity and technology complementarity. Technology similarity describes the degree to which the technological problem solving of two companies focuses on similar narrowly defined areas of knowledge. Technology   TABLE 3. COMPANIES?

V. CONCLUSIONS   This paper provides a method based on text mining of  patents to help extract technology intelligence to facilitate M&A. We take the NCS industry as an example. NCS is the most important part of numerical machine tools. The paper follows a technology forecasting approach and outlines a technology synergy analysis based on a multi-term Boolean search to distinguish NCS records.

This study has a few limitations. Some doubt remains regarding the reliability of patent data. Sometimes patent data cannot reflect the core technology of a company because some patent-based indicators could be obscured by strategic behavior; that is, sometimes an emerging technology is not yet permitted for patenting. Another limitation is that the latest patent data we studied are2 years old because of the 18-month patent application period. In the meantime, some changes in NCS-related technology may well have occurred.

Within these limitations, the paper sought to forecast developmental trends for key candidate technologies, and based on the technology trends revealed, look for technology acquisition candidates for a certain company.

The technology forecasting results suggest that NCS has become a global research hotspot in the field of machine tools in recent years, and patents have reached increased significance in corporate activity. The analysis of country-topic correlation leads us to conclude that there are two research clusters in the world, one centered in Japan and the USA, the other centered on Germany. While China is geographically far away from the other countries, it has only a faint relationship with Japan and Taiwan; in this relationship the key words are ?control,??signal? and ?compatibility,? which are different from other countries and do not represent NCS core technology. In addition, publication keywords correlation analysis also indicates that control system is a current research hotspot and focus.

We then examine the top patent applicants and top publication institutions. As shown, the top patent applicants are mainly Japanese and German corporations, while top publication institutions mainly come from China and the USA. This divergence is logical since the nature of patents and publications is different in that patents focus on applications whereas literature researches theories and methods.

At the same time, we find that Japanese corporations are powerful in the NCS machine tool industry. Hence we choose the companies FANUC and MITSUBISHI as study targets.

Comparing SMTCL with them, based on IPC analysis, we observe that G05B19 is the main weakness?incidentally, this is a part of the NCS core technology.

Looking at SMTCL?s M&A history shows us that M&A did increase their patent portfolio and business income. We also learn that SMTCL is behind the leading NCS-related companies in patenting, although it?s number 1among machine tool enterprises in the world. To make up for its weaknesses, we search for some technology acquisition candidates for SMTCL. We first download all patents related to the technology where SMTCL is lacking. Then we develop a patent filter to select a list of companies as potential targets.

We analyze the targets? respective patent portfolios, filtering out all but 3 companies. Finally, we measure the technology synergy among the 3 companies, and analyze the similarity and complementarity between the targets and SMTCL.

In conclusion, we have grasped the development trends of some candidate technologies by patent data and find the disadvantages of SMTCL. To compensate for the disadvantages, we look for technology candidates for SMTCL M&A.
