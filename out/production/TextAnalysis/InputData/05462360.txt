I. INTRODUCTION Association rule[1,2] mining is an important data mining  method for determining consumer purchasing patterns in transaction databases. Nowadays, many applications have used to discover useful information.

Concept lattice was presented by R. Wille[3], reflects entity-attribute relationships between objects, and represents knowledge shown with hierarchical structure on the Hasse diagram, thus it is properly applied to the description of association rule mining in databases. Apriori algorithm employs an iterative approach known as a level-wise search, where k-itemsets are used to explore(k+1)-itemsets, the set of frequent 1-itemsets is found by scanning the database to accumulate the count for each item, and collecting those items  that satisfy minimum support. The resulting set is denoted L1.

Next, L1 is used to find L2, the set of frequent 2-itemsets, which is used to find L3, and so on, until no more frequent k- itemsets can be found. The finding of each Lk requires one of full scan of the database. The Apriori algorithm[4,5,6] is used to discover frequent itemsets in order to mine association rules from frequent itemsets.

The shortcoming of Apriori algorithm is that it needs scan the database for many times in the course of finding frequent itemsets, and in the join step, to find Lk, a set of candidate k- itemsets is generated by joining Lk-1 with itself, costs a great deal of CPU time.

FP-growth(Frequent Pattern-growth)[7-13,27] adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy as follows. First, it compresses the database representing frequent items into frequent-pattern tree, which retains the itemsets association information, it then divides the compressed database into a set of conditional databases, each associated with one frequent item or ? pattern fragment? ,and mines each such database separately.

A study on the performance of the FP-growth method shows that it is efficient and scalable for both long and short frequent pattern, and is magnitude faster than the Apriori algorithm.

Bioinformatics is a promising young field that applies computer science and technology in the molecular biology and develops algorithms and methods to manage and analyze biological data. Because DNA and protein sequences are essential biological data and exist in huge volumes as well, it is important to develop effective methods to compare and align biology sequences and discover biosequence pattern.

And, association rule mining is an effective method and algorithm to apply to bioinformatics.

Association rules(or Genetic Association) in gene, biology sequences and biosequence patterns are mainly implemented using the method: On the basis of hypothesis- driven theory, candidate gene analysis is directly connected with systemic knowledge of biological function, whereas a whole-genome association theoretically investigates the entire genome simultaneously[14,15]. However, there are few methods to analyze the entire genome for complex diseases have been established with respect to the availability of unbiased reliability and cost efficiency. Literature[16-21] has     developed a practical and efficient strategy for an extensive region-wide association with evenly spaced dense SNPs markers[16,17].

In this paper, the contribute is that association rule mining based on concept lattice has been applied to discovery of disease-causing gene connections and gene-drug interactions as an effective method, and the Hasse diagram of concept lattice represents the association rules more visual, vivid and concise than Apriori and FP-Growth algorithm .

The paper is organized as follows: In section II, we review the preliminaries of association rules, basic notions of concept lattice, association rule mining on concept lattice is described in section III, , an example of mining association rules based on concept  lattice is illustrated in section IV, finally, we reach the conclusion in section V.



II. BASIC NOTIONS OF ASSOCIATION RULE  AND  CONCEPT LATTICE  A. Basic notions of association rule Mining association rule is an important branch of data  mining, which describes potential relations among data items (attribute, variant) in databases, The well-known Apriori algorithm was proposed by R. Agrawal et al., in 1993. Mining association rules can be stated as follows:  Let I={i1, i2, ? ,im} be a set of items. Let D, the task- relevant data, be a set of transactions, where each transaction T is a set of items such that T?I. The quantities of items bought are not considered. Each transaction is assigned an identifier, called TID. Let A be a set of items, A transaction T is said to contain A if and only if A?T. An association rule is an implication of the form A?B, where A?I, B?I, and A?B=?. The rule A?B holds in the transaction set D with support s, where s is the percentage of transactions in D that contain A?B (i.e., both A and B). This is taken to be the probability, P(A?B). The rule A?B has confidence c in the transaction set D if c is the percentage of transactions in D containing A that also contain B. This is taken to be the conditional probability, P(B|A).

That is, Support (A?B)=P(A?B)=s; Confidence(A?B)=P(B|A)=Support(A?B)/Support (A)=c.

Association rule mining should be mining strong association rules that satisfy the user-specified both minimum support threshold and confidence threshold.

B. Basic notions of concept lattice A context is defined as a triple C=(O,D,R?, where O is a  set of objects, D is a set of attributes, and R is the binary relation between O and D, according to the inclusion relations between extents and intents, there is an unique ordered set that describes the structure of inherent lattice, which defines natural groupings and relationship descriptions between the objects and their attributes in the context, this structure is also known as (Galois) Concept Lattice[3,22](for short, CL).

Definition 2.1: Each pair such as (A,B) derived from the context is called a concept, where A?P(O), B?P(D), and  P(O), P(D) are the power sets of O and D respectively, A and B create a connection in terms of the following properties.

A?={m?D|?g?A, gRm}, B?={g?O|?g?B, gRm}.

Where A?=B, B?=A. A is called the extent of concept, and B is called the intent, denoted as Extent(C) and Intent (C) respectively.

Definition 2.2: In a CL, partial order relation ?< ? between concept C1=(A1, B1) and C2=(A2, B2) is defined as C1<C2?B2?B1, then C1 is the sub-concept (son) of C2, and C2 is the sup-concept (father) of C1, that is, the relation between C2 and C1 is the relation as that of father and son.

If C1<C2, there exists no a concept C=(A,B), such that satisfies C1<C<C2, C1<C2 is called a direct-sub-concept-direct- sup-concept-relation between C1 and C2, the Hasse diagram of concept lattice is generated according to the partial order relation: If C1<C2 is a direct-sub-concept-direct-sup-concept, there exists an edge from C2 to C1.

From the definitions, the hierarchical relations between the concepts are shown to us, which can be used as an efficient tool for data analysis and knowledge acquisition. And how to build concept lattice, please refer to the generation algorithm of concept lattice in literature[22].



III. MINING ASSOCIATION RULES BASED ON CONCEPT LATTICE  As for concept C=(A, B) in a CL, we can introduce support(B)=|A|/M of intent B to concept C, M is the sum of transactions in D, |A| is the extent cardinal of concept C.

Definition 3.1: If Support (B) of concept C in a concept lattice is big than the support threshold, the concept C is called a frequent concept, where intent B of concept C is frequent items.

Theorem 3.1: Frequent items is corresponding to the intents of concepts lattice each other.

Theorem 3.2: If C=(A, B) is a concept in a concept lattice, the support of B is |A|/M, where |A| is the extent cardinal of C, M is the sum of transactions in D. If B is frequent itemsets whose support is bigger than the support threshold, B must be a group of equivalent intents of the concepts.

According to the theorems mentioned above, association rules mining based on concept lattice should abide by the theorems as follows[23-25]: Theorem 3.3: If concepts C1=(A1,B1), C2=(A2,B2) satisfy C2?sup(C1), we can min association the rule: B2 ? B1-B2, its confidence is |A1| / |A2|, otherwise, B1-B2 ? B2, its confidence is 100%.

Theorem 3.4 If concepts C1=(A1,B1)?C2=(A2,B2) do not satisfy C2?sup(C1), and there exists nonempty common maximum-sub-concept C=(A,B), namely, ?C?=(A?,B?), which makes C? sup(C?)?C1?sup(C?)?C2?sup(C?) true, there are association rules between B1 and B2: B1?B2, B2? B1, their confidences are |A|/|A1|, A|/|A2| respectively.



IV. AN EXAMPLE OF MINING ASSOCIATION RULES BASED ON CONCEPT LATTICE  From the definitions and theorems above mentioned, we can mine association rules on concept lattice. Taking a typical Example as market basket analysis on page 236 in literature [26], There are nine transactions and 5 items in this ALLELectronics  transaction database D, that is M=9. Here, assumed that there are nine gene sequences(namely,9 transactions), and the longest sequence is 5 genes(namely,5 items) in each gene sequences, less than 5 genes is permissible.

Next , we want to know how  the 5 genes are arranged in a particular order, then find each sequence with a unique role in cellular function, such as disease- causing gene connections and gene-drug interactions by the method of association rule mining based on concept lattice.

According to the items in Table I, the Hasse diagram of concept lattice can be built as shown in Figure 1.

The support of frequent itemsets is not divided by M=9 in order to be convenient for explanation. We can easily obtain frequent itemsets, for example, such as the support of frequent itemsets {I1} is the extent cardinal of concept({145789},{I1}), whose support is 6,thus,the rest may be deduced by analogy, the support of frequent itemsets {I2} is the extent cardinal of concept({1234689},{I2}), whose support is 7; the support of frequent itemsets {I3} is the extent cardinal of concept ({356789}, {I3}), whose support is 6; the support of frequent itemsets {I1I2}, {I1I3},{I2I3},{I2I4,I4} is 4, 4, 4, 2 respectively, the support of frequent itemsets {I1I2I3}, {I1I2I5,I5}, {I1I2I4} is 2,2,1 respectively.[26]  Similarly, we can generate association rules from the Hasse diagram in diagram, for example, association rule I1? I2?I5, the support of frequent itemsets {I1I2} and {I1I2I5,I5} is 4,2 respectively, then the confidence of association rule I1? I2?I5 is 2/4, as such I2?I5?I1,I1?I2?I5,I2?I1?I5, whose confidence is 2/2,2/6,2/7 respectively. However association rule I2?I5?I1, Since concept {I2I5} does not exist, there exists an common maximum-sub-concept {I1I2I5,I5}, whose support is 2, we can obtain the association rule I2? I5?I1,whose confidence is 2/2. The results are the identified with Apriori to generate association rules.

Association rule is applied to biosequence pattern, which has mostly advantages over rough set[27], Apriori algorithm and FP-growth, we can easily  find the biosequence on the Hasse diagram of concept lattice, and the display pattern is very visual, and concise for us to see the genes, nucleotides and amino acids occur in nature with different probabilities.

As shown in Figure I, taking the 3 concepts ({1234689}, {I2}), ({356789},{I3}) and  ({3689}, {I2I3}) as an example, Gene I2 and I3  generate a new gene sequence  Gene I2I3, as for Gene I2 and I3 ,which occur in nature with different probabilities,  4/7 for Gene I2,  and 4/6 for Gene I3 respectively, 4, 7, 6 are the support of frequent itemsets{I2I3},{I2} and {I3} respectively, namely, in turn are the extent cardinal of concept ({1234689}, {I2}), ({356789}, {I3})  and  ({3689}, {I2I3}). On the other hand, from the Hasse diagram of concept lattice, we can clear watch the biosequence pattern relationships, easily find ancestor-child relations and probabilities of biosequence, for example, concept ({3689}, {I2I3}) is the common child of concept ({1234689},{I2}), ({356789}, {I3}) , and. concept ({3689}, {I2I3}) is the ancestor of concept ({89},{I1I2I3}), and ({8},{I1I2I3I5}), concept ({89}, {I1I2I3} is the father of concept ({8},{I1I2I3I5}).



V. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, from the above discussion, we can reach the  conclusion: From itemsets(intents of concept lattice), we can intuitively generate association, easily find the biosequence pattern relations on the Hasse diagram of concept lattice, the approach is visual, vivid and concise, users can interactively discover useful association rules in Hasse diagram of concept lattice according to his interest, improve the efficiency of mining, avoid the blindness.
