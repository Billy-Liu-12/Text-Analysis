I.  INTRODUCTION  The five-year survival rate of liver cancer is low, 14% according to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program database of the National Cancer Institute from 2003 to 2007 [3]. Since in the early stages of liver cancer, patients usually do not show signs or symptoms, improving early diagnosis is essential in order to reduce morbidity and mortality rates.

Association rule mining, a popular method for discovering interesting hidden relationships or patterns between variables in large databases, has demonstrated benefit when applied to cancer detection and management. To date, however, no studies have applied it to liver cancer. The objective of this study was to apply the FP-growth association algorithm to discover patterns from liver cancer data, which can hopefully be used for early detection.



II. METHODOLOGY  This study used anonymized data obtained from the British Columbia Cancer (BC) Agency, consisting of a total of 6,064 patients (6,047 from BC, 17 from the Yukon), diagnosed with liver cancer between January 1, 1970 and December 31, 2010. The diagnoses include ICD-O-3 cancer sites C220 (liver) and C221 (intrahepatic bile duct).

The attributes below, properly pre-processed and encoded, were selected for analysis:  1. Gender 2. Diagnosis age range 3. Current health authority (geographic division of the province of BC for health administration), BC only  4. Diagnosis health authority, BC only 5. Cancer site 6. ICD-O histology code 7. Tumor subgroup (liver, Hodgkin?s, non-Hodgkin?s, undefined, other), BC patients only  8. Death age range 9. Patient status code (alive or deceased) 10. Treatment (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery), BC only  The data were then submitted through the FP-Growth algorithm using varying levels of support.



V. RESULTS  A. Preliminary data analysis: In BC, 4,173 liver cancer patients were men, compared to 1,874 women. This shows an incidence rate of liver cancer in men being 2.226 to that of women. However, the life- death ratio (number of living to deceased patients) is the same (0.1) for both men and women. In the Yukon Territory, men are affected about three times as much as women, although the number of patients is small. The life- death ratio is 1.0 for women and 0.3 for men.

BC liver cancer patients who are alive at the time of data analysis were diagnosed at a younger age than those who were already deceased. In the Yukon Territory, the opposite trend is observed.

Liver cancer incidence in BC is highest for in the Vancouver Coastal and Vancouver Island Health Authorities, although the Fraser Health Authority actually has the largest population.

B. Association rules: The main outcome of this study is a group of association rules, which are developed, tested and validated on real liver cancer patient data.

The main factors associated with increased liver cancer incidence in BC included:  ? age ranges 60 ? 69 and 70 ? 79, with 91-97% and 87? 97% confidence, respectively  ? male gender, with 88-100% confidence ? geographic location in the Vancouver Coastal and Fraser Health Authorities, which cover the Greater Vancouver Area, with 96% and 88% confidence, respectively The main factors associated with decreased survivability in BC included:  ? age range 70 ? 79, with 100% confidence and 27% support  ? male gender, with 87-100% confidence and 29-63% support The main factor associated with both increased liver cancer incidence as well as decreased survivability in the Yukon was age range 60 ? 69, with 100% confidence and 18 to 30% support.
