Integrating Sensor Webs with Modeling and Data- assimilation Applications: An SOA Implementation

Abstract A sensor web framework is implemented to enable two-way interactions between sensors and traditional modeling/data-assimilation applications for the Land Information Sensor Web (LISW). A service-oriented architecture (SOA) is adopted and implemented with REpresentational State Transfer (REST)-style web services.

The web services are built upon a message-oriented middleware with a publish/subscribe model. Prototype sensor observation service (SOS) and sensor planning service (SPS) are implemented as REST-style web services.
