I. INTRODUCTION  ith the developments in database technology, spatial  ever-increasing attentions of the sectors that use spatial information, such as urban planning, the utilities industry, and transportation management. However, the lack of analytical funclions on spatial data has been the boltleneck of their extensive application. To improve the processing capability of spatial data, it is of great importance to build on the spatial database platform and its basic analysis functions, to introduce machine learning and artificial intelligent algorithms based on the characteristics of spatial information, and to create uniform data models for spatial data analysis and mining.

The application of information technology in railway systems places great demands on the management. analysis, and application of spatial data. RGlS is created to meet this challenge and integrates existing railway management information systems (MIS). One key component of RGIS is the distributed spatial database and its shareware platform built on the railway base information, the environment in which spatial data analysis and mining tools customized to 0-7803-8la5-4/03/S17.00 0 ZW3 IEEE  W data management and applications have captured the  the railway industry are designed. For a railway base data platform and RGIS, providing support for analysis and decision-making related to spatial locations is necessiuy. The Chinese railway industry has invested billions of RMB in building a large number of railway MIS successhlly in the nation-wide railway systems. These systems play a very important role in railway operations and have accumulated a tremendous amount of data Due to the lack of platform and tools to process spatial data, it is difficult for these systems to adequately present. utilize, and proccss the intrinsic spatial distribution of the information and resources in the railway systems. This results in low efficiency and flexibility of the query and presentation mechanisms, and obstrucu the development of analysis, decision-making support, and other services that utilize spatial locations. Consequently, sfatc-of-the-art techniques of spatial data analysis and data mining can enhance the intelligence of railway information systems and extend railway base data platform with the ability to perform detailed analysis and assist in decision-making.

Currently, research on spatial data mining is being actively conducted. The characteristics of spatial data representation, data structures, and operations make spatial data mining techniques fairly complex. Practical tools that meet industry requirements are rarely seen. This paper will introduce spatial data mining techniques into RGlS to extend RGlS with complicated spatio-temporal analysis and decision-making support, beyond the generic functions such as spatial data presentation. query, and statistical analysis.

This paper is structured as follows. In Section I1 is discussed the design and implementation of RGIS. Following the retrospection is the complete description of applications of spatial data mining techniques in RGlS in Senion m. In Section N the conclusions are given.

II .  DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF RGlS  RGlS is a system based on GIS and underpinned by computer networks, and serves the need of railway planning,     managemen< applications, and decision-making. It can efficiently store various kinds of data, blueprints as well as multimedia information, and supports railway operation, thematic management, spatial analysis, strategic decision-making, and public service. It provides efficient query of track resources and environmental information along a railway line, and helps to standardize the operation techniques and data management [I].

A. Requirement Analysis of RGIS RGIS can be @plied in the following areas: operation and  maintenance of railway facilities; organization of train operation, disaster rescue, marketing, and railway-related decision -making.

Facility operation and maintenance is one of the daily tasks of the railway operators.,Using RGIS, information on railway equipments can be collected, stored, and analyzed to provide statistical data Various kinds of information, such as railway transportation, signaling and communications equipments, lowmotives and track maintenance, can be visualized by electronics maps (E-map). Combined with TMIS, RGlS can simulate new operation graphs and train schedules on the E-map. RGlS can provide detailed information about accident sites including topography and physiognomy of the sites, railway facilities, and the distribution of  rescue facilities so that rescue plans can be created quickly and railway operations can be restored as soon as possible. RGlS can also provide dynamic,, real-time information about freight, passengers, and ticketing to enhance the competitiveness of railway transportation RGlS can perform analysis on traffic volume and transportation capacity for specific tracks or railway stations to support decision-making in new railway construction and pricing [ I].

The modular structure of RGIS is shownin Fig.2.

B. Data managemenf in RGIS Data in the RGlS should include digital maps stored in the  railway spatial database (base data on tracks, stations, bridges and culverts, NMeIS, power supply, water supply, and other equipmenls in the railway network), associated attribute database, shadow database, and DEM database. By building the spatial data sharing platform, spatial information and .

related non-spatial information on the operation of the whole railway network can be handled in a scientific way and shared within the railway industry. Uniform services can be provided for applications in railway planning, construction, and management [I]. The RGIS data model is s h o w  in Fig.1.

Display control refers to zooming in and out, and layer management of maps. Data editing refers to appending, modifying and deleting spatial data  111. APPLICATIONS OF SPATIAL DATA MINING TECHN~QUES IN RGIS  Currently, research on spatial data analysis and mining is becoming more active. The group led by Han liawei, professor in the Department of Computer Science at Simon Fraser University in Canada, created a prototype system for spatial data analysis and mining on the Maplnfo platform.

The system performs spatial data mining operations such as spatial data feature description, spatial comparison, spatial correlation, spatial clustering and classification [2]. De Ren LI, professor from the Wuhan Surveying Technology University, proposed that multiple kinds of knowledge such as geometrical information, spatial correlation, relationship between geometrical nature and other attributes can be discovered from a spatial database. Using data mining, finite spatial data might produce knowledge in unlimited ways.

However, not all data can be effectively processed by general data analysis and mining tools. If spatial data mining techniques are applied in RGIS, it will greatly improve the utility of RGIS.

A. Spatial data mining techniques  Spatial data- consist of objects that w-occupy a certain space and are interrelated. In other words, spatial data are the symbols rewrding spatial position, thematic features, and time information, which are the there basic elements expressing physical world space changes. Spatial objects are defined by spatial data types and their spatial inter-relation.

The vast amount of  data stored in spatial databases can represent the objects' spatial topological features, non-spatial attributes. and state changes in time.

Spatia1,data mining is the process to discover knowledge in spatial data sets. to extract spatial modes and features in which the users are interested, to identify the relationships between spatial data and non-spatial data  Spatial data mining tools include characterization and induction on spatial data, spatial correlation 'rule mining, spatial classification and clustering, spatial trend analysis and spatio-temporal mining ofdynamic data [3].

I) Spatial Analysis Using the various spatial analytical models and spatial  operations in GIS. spatial analysis processes the data in spatial databases to generate new information and knowledge.

Common spatial analysis techniques include topological analysis. buffer analysis, distance analysis, overlay analysis, network analysis, topography analysis, surface analysis, and  ' forecast analysis. The goal is to identify object correlations such as interconnection, neighborhood, and interdependency, or to determine the shortest or optimum path among objects.

knowledge that supports decision-making.

2) Staristical Analysis Statistical analysis is widely used on spatial d a w  focusing  on non-spatial features of spatial objects and phenomena. The statistical approach has a solid theoretical foundation and a large number of maNre algorithms.

3) Induction Induction is widely used in machine learning. It centers on  extracting general rules or modes from a large amount of empirical data In GIS, spatial relationship concept tree.can be built for knowledge discovery.

4) Classification and clustering approach By either the classification or the clustering approach, data  can be divided into a series of differentiated groups in accordance with a certain distance or similarity measure.

Both approaches can be applied to spatial data analysis by making spatial division of the subjects, based on the criterion that intra-group differences are smaller than inter-group differences. For classification, the number of groups and the characteristics of each group are known beforehand, whereas for clustering, these %e determined in the clustering process.

5) Sporial characlerislic and trend analysis approach These are mining algorithms based on neighborhood plots  and neighborhood paths. A spatial characteristic is defined as the set of objects with certain spatial or non-spatial properties.

The values of interest are the relative frequency of  the occurrence of non-spatial attributes and that of objects in different spaces. Spatial rules are extracted from the change in relative frequencies when a spatial object set is extended to its neighborhood set. Spatial trend analysis starts from a specific spatial object, and finds .out the rules of change in one or more non-spatial attributes. The efficiency of these algorithms, to a large extent, relies on the ability to deal with the neighborhood relationship.

6) Digitai map image analysis andparrern recognition . Spatial databases store alarge number of figures and image  data. Some image analysis and panem recognition techniques can be directly employed to data mining and knowledge discovery, or to preprocessing before other data mining approaches are used.

Artificial neural networks. genetic algorithms, fuzzy set and rough set approaches, and visualization techniques can also be applied to spatial data mining. Because the majority of spatial data are image data with a vast amount of information. algorithm efficiency is a very important reswch problem.

E. Applications ofspatial data mining in RGIS Up to now, the applications of RGIS.are limited to railway  facility management, track maintenance management, 3-D visualization and visual imaging of railways, railway land zoning, railway reconnaissance and design, train positioning, monitoring, and scheduling as well as in combination with TMIS. RGIS that offers advanced spatial analysis and decision-making support is rarely seen.

Spatial data mining is not the .simple application of classical data mining techniques to spatial data, nor a copy of     classical geological analysis functions. It utilires the powerful spatial analysis functions in GIS and intelligent data mining approaches to discover the knowledge and association rules hidden in spatial data, to forecast future trends on the basis of available data, and to perform intelligent spatio-temporal analysis. RGlS serves the purpose of providing scientific, railway-specific, space-and-time related analysis, forecast, and decision-making support.

darn  Traditional sequential panern mining is based on the time factor, and spatial sequential pattern mining is based on the space factor. The mining of the spatio-temporal sequential panems in railway data with spatial attributes in the RGlS should be based on both the space factor and the time factor (so called spatio-temporal pattern [4]). The mining of spatio-temporal sequential panems differs from the normal mining of sequential panems: the time-based frequent item sets will first be computed with a variation of the a priori algorithm, and the space-based frequent item sets will then be computed with the corresponding spatial algorithm, then the reduction set will be created from these two group of sets by the joining algorithm. The pseudo code of this basic algorithm is:  Spnrio-temporal sequenrinlpnttern mining of spatial     131 Kaichang DI.
