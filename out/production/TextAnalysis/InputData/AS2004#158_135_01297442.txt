Abstract - Data mining aims to excavate new knowledge from existing information. When it comes to test mining, a better way is to take the context into account. The association rule, a method gaining increasing currency among scholars, enables multiple classifications of a same set of high frequency words and achieves high performance even with unstructured text data in terms of rehieval eficiency and qlanatory power of the final results. In this paper, the process of text data mining approach will be discussed. A case study from Tzu Chi University in Taiwan will be used to demonshate the implication ofthis approach.

Keywords: association rule, data mining, text data, multiple classifications.

1 Introduction A fundamental concern about data mining is to making sense of data by using pre-acquired knowledge.

Without the knowledge, data remains to he information instead of knowledge. This paper addresses the issue of "meaningful" classification of text data. Meaningful, that is, to human users and for machines. Classification rules, if not meaningful to the human users, certainly do not yield much value. The experimental database employed a logic that fits very close to class association rules (CARS) mining, a very important technique gaining increasing currency lately (Li, Han, and Pei 2001; Liu, Hsu and Ma 1998; Z a h e  and Antonie 2001, 2002). We used news stories gathered from journals and newspapers as raw material, uncovered associations needed, and used these associations to apply to classification tasks. Finally, we queried the database and generated very meaningful 3-D graphs that even end users without specific knowledge of data mining may quickly grasp the meanings of the graphs.

2 Text Mining Application - Associating Identities with Projected Actions There are three steps for using the text data mining approach in this study, which are [ I ]  data pre-processing, [2] data selection, and [3] data mining. For the purpose of illustrating the text data mining approach, the following three sections detail the processes and use the case study for demonstration. The data is collected from two official Tzu Chi Journals, United Daily and China Times. We then extract events from those materials. Every event involves a number of named entities, which belong in different semantic classes, and some relationships that hold among these named entities.

2.1 Data Pre-processing Data cleaning: we hypothesized that members of Tzu Chi had been well indoctrinated through their routine interaction within group meetings. That  enables them to cany out emergency relief tasks collectively without the need or presence of a well-organized bureaucratic structure. Based on this hypothesis, we try to locate different patterns of association among various identities and projected actions related to different clusters of    projected actions related to different clusters of Tzu Chi members. Therefore, the preprocessing task was to identify all the nouns within those sentences, which are the units of analysis, wherein anything related to Tzu-chi was identified. While retaining all the original documents in the database, we selected, numbered, and stored these sentences as database entities.

Data Integration: next, we look at those sentences, and try to locate all the verbs, where there are, within the same sentence. It should he noted that semantic inferences is not our concern here.

Rather, we are trying to locate association and/or correlations between nouns, verbs, and their relationships, known or unknown previously. The verbs were subsequently categorized, using lexicon knowledge, into nine categories.

Data selection, transformation and reduction 2.2 Relational database design: an E R  model was 0-7803-81 93-9/04/$17.00 02004 IEEE 243 developed to offer a unified view of text data.

Extracted features within those sentences are defined to different entities. Relationships are built up with the associations among these entities.

We use MS SQL Server as the relational database management and analysis system. (see EIR Model in the Appendix) Attributes and constrains definition: define all attributes on entities to show the information associated with each feature in a data layer. In addition, we also constrain database values to the valid ranges as defmed by the thematic rules.

Normalization: use 4NF (see Ghosh 1991) to organize the contents of the tables for transactional databases to prevent update anomalies and data inconsistencies and to deal with multi-valued facts.

2.3 Data Mining Time sequence analysis: show the overall pattern of the nouns and verbs in terms of frequency appearances. Further, to generate an interactive timeline displaying the major identities and projected actions covered by the corpus.

Statistical analyses are sample-specific. By drawing statistical inferences, text analysis should also follow the same rule. Our sample is limited to those appearing between September 6 and December 3 1, 200 I concerning typhoon Nari and its aftermath.

Classification analysis: analyze extracted features from sentences and discriminate these features into classes. For nouns, following the official organization structure of Tzu Chi, we classified the general identities into six categories: Charity, Culture, Medicine, Education, Volunteers and the Headquarters. For verbs, referring to their attributes, we classified them into 9 categories (V-Class): direct personal assistance, medical care, cleaning, coordinatiodcommunicatiou, counselinglvisiting, food, organizatiodcommand, interaction, and others. This step can only be done with domain knowledge and under supervision.

Thus, it qualifies as a classification analysis.

Statistical analysis: frequency distribution of nouns and verbs enabled us to fit cross-category analyses. For instance, what are the projected actions appear most frequently? To which identity group do these projected actions most often belong? And, over time, is there any particular pattern in nouns, verbs, and their interactive relationships, in terms of frequency distribution?

3 Analytic Results    3 Analytic Results We associated the unit of analysis, nouns, verbs, analysis of nouns, analysis of verbs, media type and time frame, and generated a series of graphs. With data consistency and integrity secured, these information can not only he shared but enable accurate and efficient storage, retrieval and analyses of the data. For instance, by fitting all identities with frequency higher than one with the five group categories, we discovered that the single most important identity during the whole time span was the neutral term of ?volunteers,? i.e., the rank and file of the organization. This label, in turn, belongs to the charity group. The second most significant identities were ??0 @?(Tzu Chi) and ??%%A?? (memben of TN Chi), again do not suggest any organizational linkage. Clearly, the bureaucratic sector did not play an important role in the whole operation (see Figure 1.).

Another instance is the projected actions. Over time, we discovered that action terms used by the two official Tzu Chi journals highly concentrated in September and October, suggesting that projected actions may have been timedependent. Some activities are more needed in a specific time than in others. Among the nine major action categories, communications, cleaning, interaction, food and direct personal assistance have the highest frequencies.

OrganizatiodCommand? ?was far less significant. (see Figure 2) By comparison, the two national newspapers, United Daily and China Ernes, associated ?command? category most (graphs not shown). This finding is highly suggestive: either the mass media may have been covering the story with their own ?frames?; or, the Tzu Chi journals might have been intentionally framing their organization in a way that was notably different from most other similar groups.

Given that all mass media tend to follow similar professional guidelines in covering stories, we believe that it is more like to the former case, namely the two national dailies simply followed their own frames instead of looking into the actual mobilization process of Tzu Chi.

This is a very good example demonstrating what text data mining can he capable oE bring up previously unknown inferences from readily available information, with, of course, the help of pre-existing howledge ahout the subject matter.

The most complex analysis we experimented was to locate some relationship between identity, identity categories, projected actions and actions categories over time. We complete this process by first creating three-dimensional graphs through cross analysis, then repeating the same procedure for each period of time. For instance, we excavated the top 10 identities with the highest frequencies and their distribution pattern among the identity categories. We did this using only September data. Then, we refit the analysis, using October data. Then  repeat the other months. The mining results were then juxtaposed in sequential order and created a 4-D visualization (see Figure 3).

Associational Patterns of Identities and Identity Groups over Time 4 Concluding Discussions This study experimented to test the association rule approach of data mining on a text database. The primary goal was to excavate previously unknown ?knowledge? from readily available information. To that end, we have succeeded. We have also tried to demonstrate that utilizing pre-existing knowledge of the subject matter, i.e., domain knowledge, researchers may be better-off in creating user-friendly mining    may be better-off in creating user-friendly mining rules. At least for our sample, we consider this to be another achieved goal.

So, where does this lead us to? There are many methods being employed for conducting data mining now. Most of them deal with numerical data. For this kind of databases, researchers are mainly pondering upon the fastest and most efflcient way to store and retrieve data. Interpretation of the retrieved results, in turn, was considered the job for end users. This logic does not apply to text databases, especially those containing unstructured texts written in .natural language. The distinction line is the ?context? (Cohen and Singer 1999). Isolated words, phrases, and sentences do not yield as many meanings as when they are put into contexts. For instance, ?direct personal assistance? may not sound particularly interesting in any text. However, when the reader clearly understands that this action was executed in emergency relief tasks and by a group of like-minded volunteers, its implication clearly is different. Both natural and social sciences have witnessed significant increase of text data recently. If we keep in mind that all sciences require effective communication, or ?sense making,? if you will, then the issue salience of ?meaning? in text data mining is self-evident.

Locating the themes and making sense of this finding can be used as effective tool for business operation (Dorre et al. 1999). Simply sorting what part of the texts in daily corporation communications is relevant or useful may constitute a burden for any business. Using our approach of exploring association patterns between different categories, such as between identities and projected actions, it is possible to prepare unstructured textual data toward creating knowledge. Ideally, it should be noted, such mining process should be automatic to achieve the maximum efficiency and speed. Nevertheless, our study used texts written in Chinese characters. Up to now, there is not automatic process of data retrieval for any Chinese character-based databases. Creating an algorithm for this purpose was never our goal. However, this issue certainly deserves further exploration by other researchers, Indeed, our approach indicated that small corporations may particularly benefit themselves from this technique, if their objective is to sorting out their own text data. Since the association rule is sample-specific, the initial sample serves as a key map to smooth the way for future data classification and  management, even without an algorithm tool. Over time, of course, this key map should be updated to he commensurate with internal changes of the organization.

As a method of research, association rule mining needs to deal with some potential problems still.

Among other things, this method is highly dependent on statistical inferences generated from word frequencies, As such, it would have to address two fundamental issues in statistics: reliability and validity.

Space does not allow for a full-scale discussion for these issues. It sufftces to say this much once the relational database is created and mining rules established, the overall reliability is sufficiently high.

Nevertheless, the ultimate concern is on validity, wherein the scheme, definitions, classifications, and analytical results make sense to the largest amount of end users. That issue along demands for an independent investigation. Our study at least points to one direction: such validity is not impossible to acquire from a text database.
