Abstract: WiMAX (Worldwide interoperability for  microwave access) is an anticipating technology in rendering the wireless link over large distances since they provide eminent data rate, could be deployed at a small price and covers a big region. It is based on IEEE 802.16e standard, which specify five dissimilar service classes of data delivery for providing better QoS (Quality of Service) demand of certain applications like VoIP, video conference, Web, etc. Mobility in a network represents nodes distribution and movement over the network. Group mobility is a concept in which a group of MN?s moves at a same time particularly in the same direction with small space of the interval between individual nodes in a particular group. Such a Group mobility scenario is usually seen in military and emergency applications, in which battalion MNs moves in a same direction with a minor separation between the MNs in a group. There are various challenges associated with group mobility concept. In the group handover, as a lot of users in a group try to initiate a handover at the same time, it causes network congestion and increases the probability that the handover would be blocked. When a group of MNs moves out of coverage of currently serving BS (Base Station) into another BS, multiple handovers has to be performed at the same time which introduces large handover latency due to collision and back off. At the same time, MS does not get the coverage when the serving mobile BS moves out of its coverage and the other BS is far away from it. So, when a leader MS concept is introduced, it paves a solution for all these problems. The Leader MN integrates numerous handover processes from the group of MN?s into solitary, which could eradicate the collision of the ranging request at the base station and reduce the latency found in the network. In addition, it also overcomes communication crack problems by handling local communication by acting as a temporary BS when there is no suitable target BS to perform handover. The main aim of this paper is to analyse the impact of VoIP on the group mobility concept with leader MN in WIMAX networks using various service classes. Some QoS parameters are analysed for the network with the leader MN concept using different service classes for VoIP applications. The results demonstrate that, ertPS and rtPS paves as a good service for VoIP applications. Since ertPS and rtPS are real time service classes, it outperforms other service classes in various aspects.

It also reveals that the introduction of leader MN concept results in better reduction of handover latency, Average Delay, Jitter and paves a way for improvement in other QoS parameters like Throughput, PDR (Packet Delivery Ratio) and MOS (Mean Opinion Score). The delay is found to be high for the network with no leader MN concept as the there is no integration of the ranging request of the individual MNs in a group into a single request and no local communication handling to defeat the communication breakage. Also, as the network QoS parameters are analyzed by increasing the number of groups in a network, it is found that there is degradation in their performance due to the congestion that  occurs in the network. Thus the introduction of leader MN overcomes all these drawbacks and shortens the latency incurred in the network and also improves QoS parameters.

I. INTRODUCTION WiMAX is a fourth generation wireless communication  technology and it is based on IEEE 802.16 specification, which is a standard for Wireless Metropolitan Area Network (WMAN). It is a highly hopeful technology that offers higher data rate, supports large number of users and covers a larger area. Mobility in a network describes the movement of the nodes involved in the network [1]. Group mobility is a concept in which a group of MN?s moves at a same time particularly in the same direction with small space of the interval between individual nodes in a particular group.

Military tactical communication, disaster recovery, emergency and rescue operations are some of the widespread scenarios of group mobility. In a military environment, there are chances of destruction of the Base Station (BS) due to bombing. So, it could lead to the entire communication breakage. Therefore, a mobile BS is a good choice when compared to the stable base station. Handover is one of the most essential process because mobile nodes cannot acquire contact to the same BS during mobility [2].

There are various challenges associated with the concept of group mobility handover. In a group handover mechanism, network congestion would occur as a large number of mobile nodes in a group initiates handover at an equivalent time, which in turn raises the chances of handover blocking and also raises the handover latency due to collision involved and the corresponding backoffs.  At the same time, there is a breakage in the communication link when the MN?s does not get the coverage from the serving mobile BS.

This out of coverage condition occurs due to two reasons.

First, when the serving mobile BS moves out of its coverage of the MN?s and other BS is distant from it. Second, when the MN?s moves out of coverage from the serving mobile BS and the other BS is too far away making handover. So, when a leader MN concept is introduced, it paves a solution for all these problems. The Leader MN integrates numerous handover processes from the group of MN?s into solitary, which could eradicate the collision of the ranging request at the base station and reduce the latency found in the network [3]. In addition, it also overcomes communication crack problems by handling local communication when there is no suitable target BS to perform handover. Voice application over the internet can be achieved using VoIP.

WiMAX provides different classes of services with good QoS for VoIP [6].

In this work, a scenario is constructed with two WiMAX networks and a group of MN?s involving in each network. Among various MN?s in a group, a MN is chosen as a leader MN for reducing the handover latency and the communication link fracture. The scenario is analysed with VoIP connections between the two groups and with different service classes of a WiMAX network. The work is implemented using Qualnet 5.0.2.

The paper is structured as follows: Section II deals with the related work, Section III analyses the impact of VoIP over WiMAX with group mobility for various service classes, Section IV deals with the results and discussion and Section V concludes the paper.



II. RELATED WORK Mobility models depict the movement pattern, location,  acceleration change over time and the velocity of the mobile nodes. This movement pattern is responsible for determining the performance of the protocol. In the Random waypoint model [7], node selects a random destination and random speed. The random speed has a maximum and minimum speed. The movement of the nodes is to the selected destination. After reaching the destination, a node waits for some time and then a new destination is selected similarly as the above process. In Random walk mobility model [8], node selects a direction in which it has to be moved from the range (0?. 2?). Here, the speed given to the node is user defined. The node stops and chooses a fresh direction and velocity after the randomly selected period of time. In Random direction model [9], each node moves until they are near to the boundary of the simulation. When it reaches the boundary, it starts to move in a new direction. All these mobility models support for the mobility of individual nodes. Reference Point Group Mobility (RPGM) model [10] differs from all these models of mobility. RPGM supports group mobility concept. In this model, groups of nodes travel collectively. The complete group travels following the Random Waypoint model, and each node travels within the group also follow the Random Waypoint model.

In [11], the authors suggest a group handover scheme using the deployment of a mobile router over the train which helps in the initiation of group handover in order to reduce the latency caused due to the group handover mechanism. In [12], the channel borrowing scheme is used for reducing the handover dropping probability when mobile relay station exists. The major drawback with this idea is, in real environment, mobile relay station does not exist and thus it could not be used for group handover. In [13], tunneling approach is used at the transport layer to assist handover mechanism. But the disadvantage is that it could be valid only for soft handover. In [14], for congestion avoidance, an algorithm for target BS selection is used. It helps to roam in the heterogeneous communication network. But it is found to establish additional delays for handover. In [15], link layer and the network layer are integrated to minimize the latency of handover. A channel borrowing algorithm is used to get the better group handover mechanism. In all these cases, the structure of the moving group is unalterable, that is, any MN cannot remain the group and the other MN  cannot join the group vigorously. So a leader MN concept is used in which a MN is chosen as the leader MN when the mobile nodes in a group moves out of coverage of the serving base station and the other base station is far away from that particular group [3].



III. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE The system architecture of the work is shown in the figure 1.

In a military environment, there are large numbers of troops of soldiers moving from one end to the other. This troop of soldiers represents the group. Group mobility scenario is usually seen in military and emergency applications, in which battalion MNs moves in a same direction with a minor separation between the MNs in a group. In such an environment, static BS is not a right choice since the probability of bomb blasting over a static BS is quite easier.

So, mounting the base station over a moving object like a helicopter or aeroplane is a better choice. As the military environments are found to be large, several moving BSs are required for providing a good communication. But, it is not possible to have numerous movable BSs for better communication. So, these moving BSs are interlinked through the wireless links using a different channel with more eminent transmitting power to form the infrastructure network. Figure 2 illustrates a simple military environment with two groups and each group consisting of ten soldiers holding MNs. The base station is found to be mounted over the aeroplane. As illustrated in Figure 1, Handover process gets initiated when the signal strength of the mobile nodes goes below the threshold value. It is then followed by the scanning procedure to choose the proper target BS. This could be done by measuring the strength of the signals from all the neighboring base stations and choosing a better target BS based on the signal quality. The next process is network entry in which for establishing new connections with the target BS, ranging, capability negotiation, authentication and registration are performed one by one.  If the signal strength with the current BS falls below the threshold value, the connection with current BS gets released and starts network entry to the target BS.

Ranging is performed for synchronization with the target BS. The successful completion of ranging is followed by negotiation about resource allocation and then authentication. After completion of all these processes, MNs starts data transmission with the target BS. Due to the group handover mechanism, the collision of ranging request occurs as a large number of mobile nodes in a group performs handover and ranging at the similar time. This ranging request collision introduces backoff mechanisms and thus leading to a larger delay in the handover.  This problem could be overcome by using the concept of leader MN. A leader MN integrates the ranging requests from all the MNs into a single request and supplied to BS and thus the latency is minimized by avoiding collision. Figure 3 describes that when the coverage area of the two groups overlap, handover between the two base stations is made easier since the signal strength of the MNs is above the handover threshold. The signal strength of the mobile nodes goes under due to two reasons. First, when the MNs moves out of coverage of the base station. Second, when the base station moves away and MNs are not in its coverage area and the BS to which handover has to be made is far away.

During such situations, leader MN will maintain local communications among the other MNs within its group.

When it gets the signal strength of the new base station, leader MN obtains DCD (Downlink Channel Descriptor) /UCD (Uplink Channel Descriptor) from the new base station and performs the network entry procedure to start the connection. At the final stage, MNs of group 1 gets connected to the new base station serving group 2. It is clearly explained in figure 4. The capability of maintaining local communication with the MNs by the leader MN when there is no signal strength from any BS is one of the rewards to leader MN.

The work is based on the assumption that the troop of MNs is moving towards the same direction and there is no separation of MNs from the group and each group consisting of a leader MN. When the number of MNs in a group increases cause extra handover latency and the network performance gets degraded gradually.

WiMAX is a promising technology that supports higher data rate and covers a large area. When such a network is deployed in a military environment, it provides greater reward. It offers higher data rate, covers a larger area and it holds a large number of users since it is the hottest fourth generation wireless technology. It provides high data rate services up to 30 miles and thus supports last mile connectivity. WiMAX provides bandwidth up to 100Mbps by using multiple channels for transmission. The usage of orthogonal channels avoids interference [16 & 17].  An attractive application of WiMAX networks is VoIP which supports bidirectional voice communication. The services provided by IEEE 802.16 are:  UGS, rtPS, nrtPS, BE and ertPS.

1. UGS: Unsolicited Grant Service supports real time data streams which generate fixed size burst periodically similar to CBR (Constant Bit Rate) service in ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode). Though it is found to useful for VoIP, it is not well preferred since it tends to waste bandwidth during the off period of voice calls.

Figure 4: Illustrating the concept of signal strength step down below the threshold and functioning of the leader MN  2.  rtPS: Real Time Polling Service is for variable bit rate real time services like VoIP. It offers periodic, real time, unicast request opportunities in order to achieve the needs for real time service and it permits the subscriber station to define the size of the desired grant. It requires a higher number of request overhead compare to UGS, but it provides variable grant service for achieving better efficiency for data transmission.

3. nrtPS: Non Real Time Polling Service supports delay tolerant data with variable packet sizes. Unlike rtPS, it grants contention based polling. It is mainly meant for flows of non real time services and minimum data rate services like FTP.

4. BE: Best Effort Service supports data streams where no minimum data rate is required and packets are handled based on the available bandwidth and the allocation is contention based using ranging channel.

In case of these services, packets take more time to transfer the packets under congested network condition. It could be used for the applications where latency is tolerable.

5. ertPS: Extended real-time Polling Service supports real time variable rate services like VoIP and video streaming. It involves scheduling algorithm for VoIP with variable data rates and silence compression..



IV. SIMULATION RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The simulation of the work is done using Qualnet version 5.0.2 The simulation parameters and VoIP parameters used  for the work is shown in the table1 and table 2 respectively.

Figure 5 shows the constructed scenario of group mobility concept with VoIP applications, two groups are created by each group consisting of ten MNs. The group with green colour MNs (1 to 10) represents group 1 and the group with red colour MNs (11 to 20) represents group 2. The base station of group 1 is node 3 and whereas group 2 is node 12.

The leader MN for group 1 is node 10. Figure 6 illustrates the voice transmission for the above mentioned scenario during simulation. VoIP application is given to all MNs in a group in order to analyse the efficiency of the leader MN due to heavy collision. QoS parameters are then analysed by varying the service classes of mobile WiMAX networks. In order to analyse the performance of the network With Leader MN to that of Without Leader MN, similar network is constructed that does not use Leader MN and some QoS parameters are compared for ertPS service class using VoIP applications. Figure 6 illustrates the voice transmission for the above mentioned scenario during simulation.

Degradation in network performance has been encountered as the number of group increases in a network. Figure 7 represents the scenario of increasing group in a network.

Here, four groups are created by each group consisting of ten MN?s. The group with green colour MN?s (1 to 10) represents group 1, the group with red colour MN?s (11 to 20) represents group 2, the group with blue colour MN?s (21 to 30) represents group 3 and the group with yellow colour MN?s (31 to 40) represents group 4. Figure 8 illustrates the voice transmission for the above mentioned scenario during simulation. Certain QoS parameters are analyzed by  IEEE - 31661  4th ICCCNT - 13 July 4 - 6, 2013, Tiruchengode, India     increasing the number of groups in a WiMAX network and comparison is made between Without Leader MN concept and With Leader MN concept for increasing groups involving ten MN?s in a group with ertPS service classes.

Performance Metrices i). Packet Delivery Ratio  Figure 9 depicts that, ertPS and rtPS have good voice packet delivery ratio as they are real time service classes.

Also, it depicts that increase in network traffic declines the PDR value due to the collision occurring in the network because of congestion. As ertPS holds well for VoIP applications, network With Leader MN and other network Without Leader MN is compared for Packet Delivery Ratio using only ertPS service class. It is shown in the Figure 10.

It says that, network With the Leader MN concept provides good Packet Delivery Ratio in comparison to the network Without Leader MN concept. Also, as the number of nodes in a group increases, there is a corresponding degradation in the PDR value due to the collision of ranging requests and backoff mechanisms involved. Figure 11 shows the Packet Delivery Ratio comparison of the network Without Leader MN and With Leader MN concepts for increasing groups involving ten MN?s in a group with ertPS service class. It depicts that the PDR of the network With Leader MN concept found to be high in comparison to the network Without Leader MN concept and there is degradation in the PDR value as the number of groups involved in the network increases.

ii). Throughput Figure 12 says that throughput for ertPS and rtPS classes are higher compared to other service classes since they are high priority service classes for real time services.

As the traffic in the network increases by increasing the number of MNs in a network, only limited resources are reserved for the service classes. So, only the lesser number of free slots is reserved for the service classes and thus the throughput drops when the network traffic is increased further.

Figure 12: Throughput for various service classes in WiMAX networks using VoIP   Figure 13: Throughput comparison of the network Without Leader MN  and With Leader MN using VoIP with ertPS service class From figure 13 it is analysed that, the network With Leader MN supplies higher throughput comparable to network Without Leader MN, also as the network size is made large by adding more number of MNs in a group, throughput gets degraded by the collision of ranging request by the MNs in a  group and the corresponding backoff in either case. It is analysed from figure 14 that due to network congestion there is a decrement in throughput value as the number of groups in a network gets incremented.

Figure 14: Throughput comparison of the network Without Leader MN and With Leader MN for increasing groups involving ten MN?s in a group  with ertPS service class iii). Average Delay  Figure 15 tells the Average Latency in the network with various service classes. It shows that UGS, rtPS and ertPS have low latency for voice packet transmission when compare other service classes. ertPS is chosen as service class for comparing the Average Delay performance of the network Without Leader MN and With MN respectively in figure 16. As a result of comparison, it is found that, introduction of Leader MN reduces the delay incurred in the network. As network congestion increases by increasing the number of MNs in a group, latency tends to increase due to larger collision of ranging request by all the MNs in a group.

It depicts that the latency tends to increase due to the congestion by increasing the number of groups in a network.

iv). Jitter or delay variation  Figure 18 shows the Average jitter value for various service classes of WiMAX with group mobility concept. It reveals that, BE services introduces more jitter when compare to other service classes since the latency of BE services gets increases under heavily congested network condition. From the graph, it is analysed that the average jitter is almost similar when a group involves up to 15 numbers of nodes. When a group tends to get highly populated by 20 numbers of nodes, there is step up in average jitter value. Among all these service classes, ertPS shows small jitter value. Hence, ertPS is chosen as a service class for comparing Average jitter performance of the network Without Leader MN and With Leader MN using VoIP as shown in figure 19.

Figure 18: Average jitter for various service classes in WiMAX networks  using VoIP    Figure 19: Average Jitter comparison of the network Without Leader MN  and With Leader MN using VoIP with ertPS service class     Figure 20: Average Jitter comparison of the network Without Leader MN and With Leader MN for increasing groups involving ten MN?s in a group  with ertPS service class.

The results depict that network With Leader MN offers small jitter compare to the network Without Leader MN. As the number of nodes in a group increases, there is gradual increase in jitter value due to larger collision involved in the network. Figure 20 tells that there is a greater variation in delay as the number of groups in a network increases.

v). Handover Latency  From the figure 21 it is analysed that the handover latency for BE and nrtPS as high in comparison to the other service classes. From figure 22, it is analysed that the introduction of the Leader MN concept in a network outperforms the network Without Leader MN by reducing the handover latency. As the groups increases, the networks take more time to handover and thus the handover latency is found to be high. This is represented in the figure 23.

Figure 21: Handover Latency for various service classes in WiMAX  networks using VoIP      Figure 22: Handover Latency comparison of the network Without Leader  MN and With Leader MN using VoIP with ertPS service class      Figure 23: Handover Latency comparison of the network Without Leader MN and With Leader MN for increasing groups involving ten MN?s in a  group with ertPS service class.

vi). MOS Figure 24 shows the MOS value for an increasing  number of mobile nodes in a network. It is observed from the figure 24 that ertPS, rtPS service provides good MOS value compare to other service classes of WiMAX network since the delay in the network due to ertPS and rtPS is very less compared to other service classes. The average MOS value for ertPS and rtPS service classes up to 25 nodes in a group is 3.23 and 3.20 representing the fair quality of voice packet reception. Figure 25 shows the performance analysis of the network With leader MN and Without Leader MN which uses ertPS service class and VoIP application. It is found to have the good MOS for network With Leader MN.

V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK  In this paper, the group handover scheme in WiMAX networks with VoIP application is implemented for the troop of soldiers in the military environment with the aid of leader MN concept introduction in the WiMAX network.

The leader MN integrates the ranging request from the individual MN in a group during handover into a single request to the BS and thus the collision of the ranging request at the base station and the corresponding backoffs gets avoided. At the same time, leader MN overcomes communication breakage by providing local communication to the other MNs in a group by acting as a temporary BS when the group of MNs moves out of coverage from the serving BS and the target BS is far away to get the coverage.

Some of the QoS parameters of WiMAX networks are analysed for this concept by using VoIP applications. The results demonstrate that there is an increment in latency and Jitter with decrements in Throughput, Packet delivery Ratio and MOS as the network size increases. Since the rtPS and ertPS are real time service classes, it outperforms other service classes in various aspects. When the comparison was made between network With Leader MN and Without Leader MN using ertPS service classes, QoS parameters are found to be improved by the introduction of Leader MN concepts. As the comparison was made between the increasing numder of groups in a network With Leader MN  concept and Without Leader MN concept, improvement has been found for the network With Leader MN concept. But, degradation in the performance of QoS parameters has been encountered for the increasing number of groups in a network. The reason for degradation in QoS parameters performance is due to heavier network congestion. In future, Leader MN can be chosen by using some of the clustering algorithms like LCC (Least Cluster Change) and the LEACH (Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy).
