Personalized Automatic Recommendations for the Web-based Autonomous  Language Learning System Based on Data Mining Technology

Abstract?Web-based autonomous language learning system enjoys great popularity among college English learners in China. It provides abundant educational resources for the learner. Efficient use of available materials on the system needs intelligent resources recommendation and personalized guidance in learning strategies. This paper uses the data mining technology to build an automatic recommendation agent to enhance the function of web-based autonomous language learning system. The automatic recommendation agent serves two functions. One is to push related resources to the learner based on the results from association rule mining of all users? resource navigation patterns. The other is to provide immediate and individualized guidance for the learner concerning strategies of online language learning. The knowledge of personalized guidance comes from the machine learning of strategies adopted by students with varied level of achievements in language learning. The framework and data structure of its implementation have been presented in this paper. Experiments show that the automatic recommendation agent improves the management of educational resources on web-based autonomous language learning system and better facilitate students? language learning.

I. INTRODUCTION With the fast expansion of educational resources  available online, learners are blessed with a great variety of learning materials. Governments and educational institutes across the whole world are well aware of the significance of setting up web-based learning environment for language learners. In the last decade, China witnessed the increasing application of web-based autonomous language learning (hereafter WALL) mode in college English teaching among Chinese colleges. WALL emphasizes learner autonomy and individuality in learning style [1]. Students study English language online without immediate or real-time supervision from teachers. It gives more freedom to learners and saves the time and efforts of English teachers.

However, confronted with profuse educational materials and free choices of study schedules, many students cannot take full advantage of the WALL system. Many valuable educational language resources are buried in the sea of teaching materials on the website. Due to lack of domain knowledge of language education on the side of computer  professionals, few systems for language learning have been developed to the extent as being intelligent enough to facilitate language learning. Behaviors of online learners remain to be fully processed to provide information for the decision-making and assessment in language teaching profession. Current WALL systems lack of certain intelligence to retrieve useful information to give appropriate recommendation and advices.



II. DATA MINING TECHNOLOGY IN WEB-BASED EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENTS  Data mining (also called Knowledge Discovery in Database, KDD and knowledge extraction) refers to the process of discovering tendencies and patterns, obtaining valuable knowledge and finding nontrivial, novel, and potentially useful models from collected data. It mainly involves researches from artificial intelligence, machine learning and statistics, etc. A universally agreed brief definition of data mining is ?the non-trivial extraction of implicit, unknown, and potentially useful information from data?, put forward by Frawley, Piatetsky-Shapiro, and Matheus[3]. Simply stated, it is the process of extracting or mining knowledge from large amounts of data[4][5].

Web-based educational environment is often a choice for distance education [6]. It extends the learning space for every learner and makes study time more flexible. Many learning systems enable students to receive tutoring, submit assignments, download resources, etc. Tracking activities of learners in the system would be very useful for educators to follow the learning process and assess the effectiveness of a course. A smart recommender in e-learning has been developed based on web usage mining through using association rules to discover patterns from web access history[6]. Some other researchers have taken into account the contents of learning materials by integrating information retrieval to guide and support e-learners [7][8].

Up to the very recent years, most e-learning systems have not been personalized [8]. Few web-base language educational environments provide any intelligent services to help students improve their online study.

III. DESIGN OF THE SYSTEM  A. Analysis of the System Objectives In view of the current development of WALL system and  data mining technology, we need to design an automatic personalized guidance agent on the WALL system. The autonomous agent collects the attributes and preferences of the language learners and traces their online learning behaviors. From those raw data, it discovers interesting rules and patterns, which can be used to give personalized language learning assistance for individual learners.

Generally, it attempts to fulfill two functional objectives.

One is intelligent resources recommendation, and the other is individualized advices concerning language-learning strategies. Experiments results show that the designed model has achieved better teaching effects and enjoyed popularity among student learners.

B. A Framework of the System The proposed system consists of many interrelated  components. Their connections are illustrated in Figure 1.

For our purpose, three modules among other components need special attention. They are feature extraction module, resources recommendation module and learning advice module. The main functions of the modules are explained in detailed as in the following.

Figure 1. A Framework for the Personalized Web-based Autonomous Language Learning System.

1) Feature Extraction Module. It collects and preprocesses information related to a certain user. The browsing behaviors of every user will be recorded and stored in the User Information Database. The user information data is the raw data to be further processed.

Through analyzing the user information via data mining technology, the system is able to discover the learning patterns of each learner. Features of individual learner are  updated into the Personalized Feature Database according to a frequency threshhold customized by the user. This Personalized Feature Database serves to dynamically trace and record each language learner?s individualized feature.

2) Resources Recommendation Module. This part serves as an intelligent web recommender agent to push forward the shortcuts to the potential interesting web resources onto the user?s interface. It is realized through counting the frequency of pages visited by the user and that of the other learners of the system. This module facilitates learners? use of the system and reduces the time used by the learner to search for resources that may interest him or her.

3) Learning Advice Module. This module is to discover the language-learning pattern of the learner, which is matched against the suggested language-learning strategy.

This module aims to give suggestions to each learner and in this way, to balance their study of language. The suggestions make learners more aware of their learning behavior and thus, it is beneficial for the leaner to self- regulate their language learning on the system.



IV. ANALYSIS OF MAJOR DATA STRUCTURES 1) Learner Behavior Mining: The system mainly uses  association rules mining to discover interesting patterns of learning resources accessed by learners and the correlation of users? online learning strategies and their achievements (evaluated by examination and exercise scores). Discovering frequent resources accessing pattern is one of the domain applications for association rules mining. Market basket analysis is the typical example of frequent item set mining[4]. Similarly, we can use the records of online learner behavior to discover the co-occurrence of different resource pages. We need to eliminate the transitional pages (such as pages containing only links to other pages) and set a threshold of minimal visit duration to filter out the meaningless pages on the click stream of a learner. The frequent visited page groups discovered by association rules mining can be used to provide page-view recommendations for the user. When a user is studying on a page, it is helpful to remind him or her of other related resources. Based on the hypothesis that most good language learners has better learning strategies, the system uses the technology of data classification to find out the online learning strategies of those categorized as ?good? students by scores of their online testing and, with this knowledge, to give suggestions for language learners to improve their study.

2) Learner Feature Extraction.

a) Description of personalized learner feature:  Personalized learner feature refers to the individual characteristics of each student. It reflects the tendency and preferences of a language learner when he or she has free access to varied educational resources. After indexing educational resources with descriptive key words, the system may describe learners? language learning interests by    their visit frequency, duration and last access time of a certain category of resources.

b) Constructing learner feature: Conventionally, learners of WALL in Chinese colleges are restricted to registered students. They log on the system by their student number. The system identifies each user by their user student number.There are two ways to obtain learner feature.

One way is to ask the learners to fill out a form to report their basic personal information, including language learning interests, demographic information, strategies etc.

This is the explicit feedback from the web learner. The other way is to follow up what a learner does on WALL system and, with those obtained data, to construct learner features.

The former is fast and direct, but sometimes not so accurate (because people often do not know what they really like to do). The latter is more objective, but requires certain data accumulation to achieve expected accuracy. Our system combines the two methods to construct the learner feature database. It classifies two kinds of user information, i.e. the static and the dynamic information. Both the two kinds of information will be stored in the personalized feature database.

3) Basic Data Structures.The data structures of the two kinds of learner feature information are defined as follows.

Student_Info_Static is the data structure to store static and unchangeable basic information of a user, while Student_Info_Dynamic is to store the dynamic information of web learning student.

Structure Student_Info_Static {  // The ID of student; using student number here long int Student_No; // The name of the student string Student_Name; // The major of the student string Student_Major; // the grade of the student int Student_Grade;  };  Structure Student_Info_Dynamic {  //The ID of student; using student number here long int Student_No; //Total online learning long int Total_Learning_Duration; time //The most frequently accessed pages by the student Hashtable<String, int>  Most_Frequented_Pages; //The longest learning pages Hashtable<String, int>  Longest_View_Pages;  /*The most frequently accessed target words  The target words list is set by the educator for the language learner to study The access frequency of a certain word can be  counted through extracting the textual contents of the pages browsed by the learner.*/ Hashtable<String,int>  Most_Frequented_Target_Words; }; In addition, the automatic guidance agent needs to  maintain for each learner a data list as showed in the following table (Table 1). We combine both web usage mining and web content mining in our system. Particularly, in the web content mining, we use a customized list of target words as our matching goals. The matched words and their frequencies in a web page are viewed as the contents of the given page. Our system is so designed as being able to inform the web learner how many target words he or she has learned and the frequencies of those words appearing in your readings, and remind you of the other target words that you probably need to pay more attention to by studying related pages and/or resources.

V. EXPERIMENTATION To implement our conceived recommendation system,  we adopted java language to construct a model of system as illustrated in Figure 1. About 50 volunteer students took part in our experiments. The experiment lasted for a semester (about 4 months, from February to July 2011). Tables from Table 2 to Table 4 are partial results of our experiment. The exhibited data are simplified for conveniences. Web access log can be used to discover associations between/among pages and resources. Classification of accessed web pages reflects the pattern of learners in their resources browsing.

The scores of online tests can be used as the dimension to find the association of learner strategy and their learning achievements. The system discovers the frequent patterns of good learner strategies to guide low achievement learners.

VI. CONCLUSION Web-based Autonomous Language Learning System  exploits the advantages of web technology, stresses the centeredness of the learner and emphasizes autonomy on the part of the learner. Meanwhile, it puts more demands on the system to support personalization and meet different needs of varied students. This paper aims to provide personalized recommendations and advices for the language learners on WALL system. The writer outlines the framework of a personalized recommendation language learning system and analyzes the major data structures. Experiments have been carried out, showing the feasibility of this application.

In the future study, there are three directions in need of our efforts. Firstly, the mining algorithm, particularly online mining, should be further optimized to adapt to the real time  feedback requirements for the WALL environments.

Secondly, information retrieval technology should be further integrated with data mining to achieve better accuracy in discovering learning patterns. Webpage view frequencies and the duration time records are only partial reflection of the learner behaviors. In this paper, words frequencies of a page are computed to retrieve the learning contents.

Obviously, it is far from enough. Thirdly, domain knowledge of foreign language teaching should play an even more important role in the recommendation system. Expert knowledge is a useful source to improve the efficiency of learner strategy discovery in the WALL system.
