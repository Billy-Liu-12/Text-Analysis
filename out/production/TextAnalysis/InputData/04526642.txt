Systematic Improvement of Fleet Operations by Integrating Enterprise Health and Maintenance Data

Abstract The punch line of the paper is the use of the Theory of Constraints by Goldratt to iteratively improve the process of maintaining a fleet of aircraft. The idea is to treat support as a process rather than doing the typical analysis and focus on improving the individual elements of the process without considering the effects on the process as a whole. The approach described is iterative and adaptive to address the nature of a complex support system.
