Satellite-Based Nowcasting of Extreme Rainfall Events Over Western Himalayan Region

Abstract?Western Himalayan (WH) region is considered to be one of the most vulnerable spots for flash flooding-related natu- ral disasters in the world. The confluence of moist air advected from Arabian sea with complex terrain has produced a series of extreme rainfall triggered disasters in recent past. However, the causal events leading to these enhanced episodes of precipi- tation lack clarity and thus flash flood forecasting still remains a big challenge. In this paper, we address the problem by studying cloud development over this region and its relationship with the underlying topography. Our results demonstrate that WH region is mostly inhabited by low-medium level clouds and governed by warm rain processes. Satellite-based analysis shows that in com- parison to cloud top temperature, cloud top cooling rate (CTCR) is a better indicator for extreme rain producing events over this region. A model for nowcasting of extreme orographic rain events has thus been developed using the spatial characteristics of CTCR to predict potential locations for orographically induced severe precipitation events. The heavy rainfall nowcasts produced by this methodology, when compared with global precipitation fields, show very encouraging results. The probability of positive identification of a heavy rainfall event is 82.8%, with a false alarm rate of 29.7% and average lead time of 2?3 h. The insights provided by this study will give an impetus to the flash flood advance warning over WH region bringing about a significant beneficial societal impact.

I. INTRODUCTION  F LASH floods in the Himalayas are estimated to cause theloss of at least 5000 people every year [1]. Timely alert of such events thus has a huge societal benefit. Though efforts to forecast these high impact precipitation events are being car- ried out [2], the desirable prediction expertise in this direction is yet to be achieved. A recent study [3] on the capability of current numerical weather prediction systems for forecasting an extreme precipitation event showed that though models pro- vided guidance regarding intensity of rainfall, the locations were not correctly predicted. The location information becomes more crucial in a topographically complex domain where rainfall forc-  Manuscript received January 18, 2016; revised April 28, 2016, July 19, 2016, August 31, 2016, and October 21, 2016; accepted January 6, 2017.

ing in hydrological processes may culminate in flash-flooding which may allow for an inadequate lead time for warnings [4].

High-resolution observation networks such as Doppler weather radars, automatic weather stations, wind profilers, ra- diometers that monitor and provide accurate data at short spatial and temporal intervals, are the most essential components of an extreme rainfall nowcasting system. In the regions where the ground-based observations are scarce, the data acquired from geostationary satellites are helpful [5]?[7] in predicting the evo- lution of convective systems due to their vertical development [8]. However, in an orographic terrain, strong updrafts leading to heavy precipitation are forced rather than dynamically driven.

The forced uplift generally does not attain the heights asso- ciated with free convection [9], resulting in relatively warmer cloud tops which are difficult to observe in satellite images.

This paper aims to provide a spatial characterization of cloud development and extreme rainfall events (ERE) leading to flash floods over Western Himalayan (WH) terrain. It also addresses the problem of satellite-based nowcasting to predict potential locations of heavy rainfall in the orographic region. Accord- ingly, in Section II, description of the data and their sources is discussed. Section III describes the spatial variability of ex- treme events over the Indian region including the ones produced due to hilly terrain. This is followed by details about the devel- opment of model for Nowcasting of ExTreme orographic Rain (NETRA) events in Section IV, validation and application of the model in Section V, and the conclusions in Section VI.



II. DATA USED  In the present study, half-hourly thermal channel observa- tions from Indian geostationary satellite Kalpana-1 have been used. Kalpana-1 consists of a very high resolution radiometer.

It has three bands comprising of visible channel operating in 0.55?0.75 ?m, water vapor in 5.7?7.1 ?m, and thermal infrared (TIR) in 10.5?12.5 ?m [10]. The Kalpana data have been down- loaded from the portal www.mosdac.gov.in. Also the Rainfall Estimation Algorithm Version-2 (RFE-2) [11], which is daily precipitation product on a 0.1? latitude/longitude grid over south Asia (70 ?110?E; 5?35?N) from the climate prediction center (CPC) of National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Adminis- tration, USA for the years 2001?2013, has also been used for model development and validation. The data were acquired from ftp://ftp.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/fews/S.Asia/.

For validation, we have used CPC MORPHing technique (CMORPH) data which produces global precipitation using low orbiter satellite microwave observations exclusively, and  See http://www.ieee.org/publications standards/publications/rights/index.html for more information.

III. SPATIAL CHARACTERIZATION OF ERE  The interrelationship between orography and rainfall spa- tiotemporal distribution is very complex. Fig. 1 shows the spatial distribution of ERE over Indian region for the monsoon months of July?September over the period 2001?2012 using CPC-RFE data. In this figure, those locations are marked with dots where there has been at least one ERE (daily rainfall greater than 244.5 mm, as defined by India Meteorological Department) in the past 12 years. It can be seen that the western coast of Indian land mass mainly the Western Ghats and the Himalayan region are vulnerable zones. In particular, the WH region is impacted severely by heavy rainfall incidences. Such high precipitation events are fairly common over the region during monsoon sea- son and cause significant damage every year [14]. In this paper, we have chosen the WH region as our study area, which has been marked with rectangle in the plot. The typical terrain of this region provides conducive environment for heavy rainfall, flashfloods, cloudbursts, landslides etc., due to a combination of different factors like deep valleys, steep gradient, vegetal cover, and geology of area. To characterize the spatial distribution of heavy rainfall events over WH, we again use the CPC-RFE data to plot the mean daily rainfall (millimeter) which exceed 100 mm [see Fig. 2(a)]. We observe that there are little data gaps, implying the prevalence of high rainfall over the entire region.

Here, we are not only interested in the maxima of observations, but also in the pattern of large observations which exceed a high threshold (>100 mm) of daily rainfall. This can also be seen by plotting the heavy rainfall probability density over WH [see Fig.

Fig. 2. (a) Map of mean heavy rainfall (daily rainfall >100 mm) over WH region. (b) Probability density curve of heavy rainfall (millimeter) over WH region.

2(b)]. We also fit the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) to the heavy rainfall dataset using maximum likelihood estimation.

GPD is a family of continuous probability distributions which is often used to model the tails of another distribution.

The GPD with shape parameter k ?= 0, scale parameter ?, and threshold parameter ? is defined as follows:  f(x|k, ?, ?) = 1 ?  ( 1 + k  (x ? ?) ?  )?1?1/k (1)  for ? < x,where k > 0 or for ? < x < ? ? ?/k,where k < 0.

In the extreme event cases, the tail behavior is of utmost im-  portance [15]. The fitted GPD has a thick tail which emphasizes the occurrences of extremely heavy to exceptionally heavy rain- fall episodes in this region. The high incidences of such natural disasters point toward smaller return periods of ERE. To analyze the frequency of ERE using CPC-RFE data over WH region, we have computed their number of occurrences at each grid point.

This has been plotted in Fig. 3 and overlaid on digital elevation map of the region. We find that there are locations which have recurrent extreme rain episodes. It is observed that occurrence of more than one ERE usually takes place at terrain heights greater than 2 km, though there are certain lower regimes which are also ERE prone.

IV. MODEL DEVELOPMENT: NETRA  A. Background and Motivation  The enhancement of rainfall over orographic regions may be governed by different physical mechanisms such as forced lifting, differential advection of moist air, cooling of warm moist air over snow covered mountains, etc.

To investigate the cloud properties, CALIPSO-GOCCP cloud fraction vertical profiles are plotted in Fig. 4 for June?September (2006?2010), both for a) Indian region; and b) WH.

Here, the mean vertical profiles and the standard deviations of cloud fraction are plotted. For the whole Indian monsoon region (which includes the WH region as well), the clouds are climatologically found to be present in the upper strata of the troposphere, although the high level cloud variability is also found to be higher. This is expected, since it belongs to Tropical deep convective zone. In contrast, for the WH, the low-medium cloud fraction is predominant as compared to high clouds and there are no sharp jumps in variability too. This is surprising, when we compare with the statistics of heavy rainfall over this region, since high clouds are conventionally more associated to heavy rainfall. However, a recent study [16] demonstrates the weak linkage between the tallest storms and the heaviest rainfall where a structure of low echo top height with large downward increase of reflectivity is found to be associated with flash flood events.

Most satellite-based rainfall estimations rely on the coldness of the cloud top as a valuable signature. Thus, the low-topped precipitation systems are difficult to identify in satellite im- ages [9]. These features associated with precipitation in WH present a challenging task in their prediction using satellite data. However, it is seen that most of the orographic rainfall is triggered by moderate to strong updrafts, which may hold the key for forecast of terrain forced severe rainfall. The mech- anism responsible for initiating precipitation in warm clouds such as in case of orographic storm is coalescence among cloud droplets, which usually requires a high sustained up- draft. High updraft velocity is also postulated to be directly related to larger drop-size resulting in intense spell of rainfall.

The updraft speed of growing convective clouds which is re- garded as the most direct measure of the strength of a storm, can be measured from satellites as the cloud top cooling rate (CTCR).

B. Algorithm Details  Earlier studies [17] have shown that CTCR can be very useful for identifying vigorous cloud growth if cloud-top parcels are much warmer than the environment. Thus, a model for Nowcast- ing of ExTreme orographic Rain (NETRA) has been developed based on the premise that the updrafts characterizing orographic lifting bear a strong relationship to the spatial distribution of CTCR pixels. NETRA comprises of three major components: first is computation of CTCR from half-hourly satellite data, second is calculation of thresholds, and third is the process of choosing those pixels which have a potential for causing flash floods.

1) Computation of CTCR: The computation of CTCR is based on the University of Wisconsin Convective Initiation (UWCI) algorithm, which utilizes geostationary satellite TIR data to compute cloud-top cooling (UW-CTC) rates [18]. In the present case, 30 min TIR channel data of Kalpana satellite are taken to first calculate a two-box mean brightness temperature (BT), centered on each pixel. Here, the smaller box considered is the pixel itself and the larger box is its (3 ? 3) pixels neigh- bourhood. First, a gross cloud test is applied to delineate cloudy pixels based on a combination of a spatial coherence test and threshold after using a median filter [19]. Similar to the UWCI technique, in this paper for each pixel, we have computed the average BT for cloudy pixels for the small box and a larger box.

This is then followed by temporal differencing of box-averaged BTs to produce unfiltered CTCRs. This is done by computing the change in BT in a cloudy pixel in two half-hourly succes- sive frames (current?previous frame). Finally, we apply a series of tests using small and big boxes to produce the final filtered CTCR field. Small/large box approach eliminates most of false alarms due to cloud motion associated with horizontal advection and motion of thin cirrus clouds over generally clear areas or small cumulus fields. The main goal of these filters is to retain only the true cooling due to storm updrafts. However, in situa- tions where there is fast cloud movement and thick cirrus cover, the algorithm may not perform well.

2) Exceedance Thresholds of CTCR: Considering the com- plex orography, the most challenging aspect was to com- pute exceedance thresholds for CTCR. Most operational al- gorithms use BT threshold (BTT) or a fixed threshold (FT) for CTCR. However, due to orographic forcing, the cooling of a cloud mass will be dependent on underlying terrain and thus exceedance thresholds cannot be assumed to have a con- stant value for the entire study region. Thus spatially vary- ing thresholds (SVT) were computed. For this, half-hourly Kalpana TIR data were used for the entire monsoon period of 2012, which was regridded at 0.1 ? 0.1 degree grid. For every grid point, a dataset of CTCR was constructed from a time series of TIR values, using the method described in Section IV-B1. Next, every CTCR dataset is fitted with a prob- ability distribution function (PDF). It was found that Gamma distribution f(x|a, b), which is defined by (2) was most suited to model the distribution of CTCR:  f(x|a, b) = 1 ba?(a)  xa?1 e ?x b , x ? (0,?) (2)    1684 IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING, VOL. 10, NO. 5, MAY 2017  Fig. 5. Gridwise CTCR thresholds (K/min) for identifying potential updrafts.

where ? is the Gamma function given by  ?(a) = ? ?  ya?1e?xdx, a ? (0,?) (3)  a is the shape parameter and b is the scale parameter. Here, we have considered the absolute value of CTCR so that it lies in the range (0,?). The threshold at every grid point is then calculated as the 95th percentile of the each fitted PDF. A spatial plot of CTCR thresholds over WH region presented in Fig. 5. It is found that the CTCR computed for the region has a high correlation (0.78) with the elevation of the region, since the updraft velocity as a consequence of forced lifting will have a strong linkage to terrain undulations. There are some regions having low CTCR thresholds (<0.7 K/min) which are more prone to recurrent heavy precipitation and thus more vulnerable to flash floods.

3) Selection of Potential Locations of Heavy Rainfall Alerts: A cloud system over WH region is considered to be a potential candidate for causing heavy rainfall and flash floods if its CTCR exceeds the thresholds defined in previous section. In real time, TIR data are acquired and CTCR is computed, and those pix- els are chosen for which, cloud cooling exceeds the extreme event frequency at 95 percentile. In other words, CTCR(i, j) > Threshold(i, j), where i and j are row and column indices. The next important step is to perform connected components opera- tion to group selected pixels into maximal connected regions so that total area of heavy rainfall may be considered. In this pa- per, we have used the iterative algorithm given by Haralick and Shapiro [20]. Moreover, there is a recurrence of ERE at specific locations (as plotted in Fig. 3). These recurrences are specially observed in case of cloudburst events (rain rate > 100 mm/h), which are very frequent in the WHR. To identify potential of a cloudburst event, we further define a vulnerability quotient index (VQI) for each grid point as VQI(i, j) = No. of ERE oc- currences (2001?2012). A flow diagram of the entire NETRA algorithm is given in Fig. 6.



V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  A. Validation for Monsoon Season (2013)  The developed model NETRA was tested extensively with CMORPH precipitation estimates for every half-hourly model output over the entire monsoon season (June, July, August and September) of 2013. The year is so chosen so that the thresholds  Fig. 6. Flow diagram describing different parts of NETRA (see Section IV-B).

The contingency table used for statistics is given in Table I.

Here, number of hits is determined as the number of pre- dicted events which have a corresponding occurrence of heavy rainfall within 6 h in a 1 degree search radius of CMORPH data. Similar procedure is followed for the other statistical parameters. SVT is compared with conventionally used BTT and FT method. BTT refers to detection of cells based on BTT (BT < 235 K), while FT refers to fixed thresholding on CTCR (CTCR > 0.5 K/min). It can be seen that the false alarms associ- ated with FT are considerably higher. However, the hits for BTT are lower than those obtained by SVT. The different statistics used in this case are defined and tabulated in Table II.

In Table II, POD = probability of detection, FAR is false alarm rate, and F is probability of false detection = Z/(Z + W), where X, Y, Z, and W are number of hits, misses, false alarms, and correct negatives, respectively. ar = ((X + Z) ? (X + Y))/n, where n = total number of samples. An ideal value of 100 and 0 is desirable for POD and FAR respectively. The equitable threat    SHUKLA et al.: SATELLITE-BASED NOWCASTING OF EXTREME RAINFALL EVENTS OVER WESTERN HIMALAYAN REGION 1685  score (ETS) measures the fraction of observed and/or forecast events that were correctly predicted, adjusted for hits associated with random chance. A higher value of ETS is desirable. For extreme events, symmetric extreme dependency index (SEDI) is also considered to be a useful testing measure, which takes into account the very low base rate of extreme events [21].

It can be seen from Table II that though POD is the highest for FT, FAR is also very high. Similarly, for BTT, the FAR is very low, but POD is also low. In contrast, SVT exhibit a high POD with a low FAR. The ETS is thus the highest for SVT, highlighting its best performance. SEDI score for SVT is found to be 96.9, which shows the capability of the proposed model for operational application. The probability of positive alert of a heavy rainfall event within 1 degree search window is 82.8%.

B. Application Of NETRA Over Two Major Cloudburst Events  We further apply the NETRA model over two cloudburst events. Both these events were warm cloud processes, developed rapidly, and caused immense damage within short span. These events were so chosen, so as to exemplify the performance of NETRA in cases which are otherwise difficult to predict.

1) Description of Case 1: Kedarnath (30.73N, 79.07E), 16? 18 June 2013: In this case, there was catastrophic heavy rainfall and flash flooding in WH region, in the state of Uttarakhand, which caused loss of thousands of lives and mass scale de- struction of enormous proportion. There have been several hy- potheses regarding the causative factors of the incessant rainfall triggering such a disaster. During the period, there was con- fluence of two branches of monsoon: Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal. Due to this, there was a rapid advancement of the mon- soon trough which was dragged by upper air westerly system towards north which propelled the low pressure system to the north-west [22]. The largest impact has been around Kedarnath, the religious destination, which was attended by thousands of people during the annual pilgrimage season.

2) Description of Case 2: Ukhimath, Rudraprayag (30.51N, 79.10E), 13?14 September 2012: An incident of cloud burst happened in Ukhimath in Uttarakhand state around 0100 hours IST in the night of 13?14 September, 2012 majorly affecting 34 villages [23]. The incident caused a major loss to life and property with nearly 50 persons found dead and many reported missing. The TRMM observed rainfall amount for the specific events is found to be 812.2 and 464.5 mm for Kedarnath and Ukhimath, respectively [24].

In Fig. 7, the first row illustrates the results for Kedarnath, while the second row presents the results for Ukhimath. Fig. 7(a) plots the BT of the cloudy pixels as observed by TIR channel of Kalpana satellite for the two events.

For Kedarnath event, it can be observed that although a large-scale system is present in the western part, the clouds are warm as evident from the BT values, which are in the range of 230?240 K. However, when we plot the BT difference [see Fig. 7(b)] in the course of half an hour (0700 GMT to 0730 GMT, 16th June), it is observed that there is a de- crease in the BT values of the order of 30 K around 30?N, 79?E. This indicates that the cloud tops have rapidly become colder, implying strong updrafts. It can be concluded that the  Fig. 7. (a) Observed TIR BT. (b) Rate of change of BT (K/min) using two consecutive images. (c) Predicted region for heavy/extreme rainfall using FT.

thermodynamic instability is brought upon by the rapid as- cent of the parcel in this case resulting in extreme precip- itation. On applying the NETRA model, an area with cen- troid at 30.44?N, 78.69 and radius of influence of 58.71 km was predicted for intense rainfall activity. The same has been shown in red in Fig. 7(d). The VQI of the location is also high, demonstrating that the location is prone to recurrent ERE.

Interestingly, this was the worst affected region during the Uttarakhand catastrophe (shown by a star), where continuous and strong episodes of rainfall ultimately led to the collapse of the Chorabari Lake (30?44?N, 79?,1?E) [25] causing unprece- dented flashfloods. Needless to say, the terrain (Terrain Map, Fig. 3) was catalytic to the disaster not only in terms of slope instability but also in triggering intense spells of rainfall. The convergence of strongly favorable meteorological conditions with topography region was responsible for large-scale inces- sant precipitation. Interestingly SVT [see Fig. 7(d)] in contrast to FT [see Fig. 7(c)] pick up only the region corresponding to the area of maximum impact. However, the supposed false alarms by FT in the plain region could not be verified due to the absence of dense grid of rain gauges in the location.

Similarly for Ukhimath event, it is demonstrated that the NE- TRA model is able to predict exact location. The lead time (difference in the time of the satellite image and the actual oc- currence of cloudburst) of more than 4 h in both cases, along with accurate forecasted region, illustrates the operational ca- pability of the model. At present, the model is being used to provide real-time alerts over WH region through Indian Space Research Organization?s web portal www.mosdac.gov.in.



VI. CONCLUSIONS  A satellite-based investigation is carried out to analyze the recurrent occurrences of flash flood producing extreme rainfall over WH region. The study revealed that the WH region is predominantly inhabited by low-to-medium level clouds. The vertical growth of clouds in this case is more conducive to warm rain processes, and bears a strong relationship with the under- lying orography of the region. A nowcasting model NETRA has been developed by considering the spatial distribution of satellite derived CTCR, to forecast potential locations of heavy precipitation. The model is validated for the year 2013 monsoon    1686 IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING, VOL. 10, NO. 5, MAY 2017  season and is especially applied to investigate the catastrophic rainfall and flash flooding at Kedarnath in mid-June. The probability of positive alert of a heavy rainfall event within 1 degree search window is 82.8%, while that within a search window of 0.5 degree is 63% with modal lead time of 2 h.
