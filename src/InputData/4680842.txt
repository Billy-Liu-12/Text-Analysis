I. INTRODUCTION  In recent years, with the rapid development of science and technology, as well as the social requirement for college students, the number of university students has constantly increased. Simultaneously, the college education quality becomes one of important issues in the college education and management. Therefore, how to ensure the quality of education and promote the reform and development of college education is an urgent task.

In order to make teaching reform strategy, guide teaching practice and increase teaching quality, it is necessary to find inherent, meaningful and valuable information [1] from student-related data. These data include student profile information and score data, which can be available from a university and are accumulated every year. Data analysis for these data is helpful for understanding the college education quality. The analysis results will help discovering the hidden patterns inside these data, avoiding students to become pre- warning ones.

This paper describes a case study of the score data analysis for pre-warning students. The given score data are provided by a university in China. The given datasets are transformed to a variety of data marts for objective analysis. Statistical analysis and association rule mining [2,3] are used in the data analytical process.



II. INVOLVED DATA AND RELATED TERMINOLOGY  In a university, the gained scores or credits of a student are a critical standard for student evaluation. At the time of graduation, every college student should gain credits, which  should be not less than the required credits. However, if a student does not pass a course, his/her pre-warning credits increase. A pre-warning student in our selected university is defined as a student, whose total credits for failing courses are more than 12 credits, not including the course credits which are gained in next exams or re-selecting course?s examinations.

Of course, a pre-warning student can become a normal student if his/her failing credits are less than 12 by passing the re- examination of the failing courses.

The analysis data are collected from four semester score data among 2005-2007. For example, the data in 2005-2006 first semester (abbreviated to ?05-06 FS?) include all the pre- warning students and their score data at the end of 05-06 FS.

The score data of the pre-warning student are collected from original data by semester, which include student No., student name, gender, pre-warning courses, pre-warning credits, specialty, enrollment college, enrollment class. Among these fields, student No. is used as the key field.

A dataset of pre-warning students can be defined as T={S1, S2, S3, ?, Sn}, where the number of  pre-warning students is n.

Assume A={S1, S2, S3, ?, Sa} is a current semester dataset and the total enrolled students in the current semester is ta; B={S1, S2, S3, ?, Sb} is the previous semester dataset of pre-warning  students; and P={S/S A & S B}, i.e. P is a intersection of A and B, and the number of P is p.

One student may have many records. These datasets are used to analyze courses incurring pre-warning credits.

Another student-course dataset is extracted from the pre- warning course datasets, which includes student No. and all his/her pre-warning course names. One student has only one record in it. This dataset is used to analyze association rules among the pre-warning courses.



III. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  A. Inverting rate and newly increasing rate  From the above definition, inverting rate is used to evaluate how many students can convert to the normal ones by taking the re-examinations in the current semester. Newly increasing rate denotes how many students are added to the pre-warning student set. And pre-warning rate can be used to learn the failing credit outline of the enrolled students in a university.

If the pre-warning rate declines, the teaching quality of a university becomes better in a certain extend; On the contrary, if the pre-warning rate increases, then it needs thinking about if there are problems in the teaching and management processes.

The objective of a university is to increase its inverting rate and decline its newly increasing rate.

With the given pre-warning course datasets, assume that ?2005-2006 Second Semester (05-06 SS)" as current semester (A). In the whole university, there are 1120 pre-warning students in 05-06 SS, 1303 pre-warning students in 05-06 FS, and 789 students both in 05-06 FS and 05-06 SS.

%45.39  7891303 =?=irA ; %55.29  7891120 =?=nirA  In 2005-2006 second semester, 39.45% of the pre-warning students are converted to the normal ones, 29.55 % of the pre- warning students are new increasing pre-warning ones.

The Air and Anir of the other semesters can be computed by the similar way. These results are described as Figure 1. In this figure, the inverting rate of ?2006-2007 Second Semester (06- 07 SS)? is the highest among the given three semesters, and the newly increasing rate of the same semester declines. These results show that the pre-warning rate in 2006-2007 is well controlled.

Comparison of the inverting rate and newly increasing rate  B. Trends of pre-warning students grouping by grade  The trend analysis of the pre-warning students can be carried out through grouping by grade. The courses taken as elective ones in the first semester and the second semester are different. And these courses are also of different difficulty levels. Therefore, the pre-warning rates in every semester are of different reasons.  The score data are separated according to semesters, such as 05-06 FS vs. 06-07 FS; 05-06 SS vs. 06-07 SS. A fresher is enrolled in the first semester and the senior is graduated at the end of the second semester.

Pre-warning rate describing by grade (First Semester)  Figure 2 is the comparison of the pre-warning rate between 05-06 FS and 06-07 FS. The pre-warning rate of each grade (corresponding to fresher, sophomore, junior and senior) is given. From the figure, we know that both sophomores and juniors are of higher pre-warning rate; the pre-warning rate of seniors becomes small since some of the pre-warning students may have passed the re-examination. The pre-warning rates of the four grades in both 05-06 FS and 06-07 FS have the very similar trend. Figure 3 is similar to that of Figure 2. From Figure 2 and 3, the students in the previous year have higher pre-warning rates except seniors. At the time of sophomore and junior, the pre-warning rate becomes higher since the study task is heavier in these semesters. It also tells us that college teaching and management should focus on the sophomores and juniors to reduce the pre-warning rate probably by carefully adjusting teaching plans and balancing courses. At the same time, we should pay great attention to the seniors and do the pre-warning inverting work well before graduation in order to ensure most students to graduate.

Courses easily incurring pre-warning credits  In the pre-warning course datasets, there are 706, 601, 635 and 553 courses in 4 semesters during 2005-2007, respectively.

It is interesting to find what courses are the most easily to incur pre-warning credits. The courses are ranked by the failing times. Among them, the top 20 courses in every semester are selected. That is, these courses have higher probably to become the pre-warning credits of students.

Among the top 20 courses, except for College English (which is divided into College English Reading & Writing and College English Listening & Speaking since 2005), there are still 11 courses incurring pre-warning credits in every     semester. These courses are Higher Mathematics II (CN1); Basis of Computer Technology (CN2); College Physics II (CN3); Linear Algebra (CN4); Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics (CN5); College physics I (CN6); Higher Mathematics I (CN7); Theoretical Mechanics (CN8); Engineering Mechanics (CN9); Electro-engineering (CN10); Material Mechanics (CN11). Figure 4 shows the pre-warning times for each course in the 4 semesters. Higher Mathematics II (CN1) and College physics I (CN6) are the most easily ones to incur the pre-warning students. In 05-06 FS, there are almost 600 students cannot pass Higher Mathematics II (CN1).

This figure declines to 43.17% in 06-07 SS.

Proportion of the top 20 and basic 3 courses  In fact, in the analytical process, the similar courses are merged, for example, College English I to IV, College English Reading & Writing and College English Listening & Speaking are merged to College English; Higher Mathematics includes Higher Mathematics I and Higher Mathematics II; College Physics comprises College Physics I and College Physics II.

Then the top 1-3 courses after re-ranked are College English, Higher Mathematics and College Physics. The failing times of students in these three basic courses is about 31% of all the incurring courses (as shown in Figure 5), which tells us that these three basic courses are quite stable among courses incurring the pre-warning credits.

In Figure 6, the proportion of the students who cannot pass these basic three courses to the total pre-warning students (BCR denotes this proportion) is about 80%. It indicates that 80% pre-warning students failed in these three courses. Even the proportion in 06-07 SS declines, but it is not obvious. As these three courses are the basic courses of a university, these are to be taken as elective courses by students. Therefore  students have higher probability to fail in these three basic courses. These results still show that these three basic courses are critical for college students in their pursuing bachelor degree. It also means that a university should focus on the basic courses in both teaching and management.

IV. MINING ASSOCIATION RULES  Data Mining (DM) is the process of digging data through sophisticated algorithms to uncover meaningful patterns and correlations that may otherwise be hidden. It has been described as ?the nontrivial extraction of implicit, previously unknown, and potentially useful information from data? [4] and ?the science of extracting useful information from large data sets or databases? [5].

Finding association rules in data mining is discovering interesting relationships among variables in large databases. A  rule is defined as an implication of the form X=>Y (X?Y=?).

X is called antecedent (left-hand-side or LHS) and Y is called consequent (right-hand-side or RHS) of the rule. For example, that students failing in Higher Mathematics are possible (with 73% probability) to fail in College Physics is an association rule.

Apriori [6,7] is a classic efficient algorithm for learning association rules in computer science and data mining. Apriori employs an iterative approach known as a level-wise search, where frequent subsets are extended one item at a time (a step known as candidate generation), and groups of candidates are tested against the data. It generates candidate itemsets of length k from itemsets of length k 1. Then it prunes the candidates that have an infrequent sub pattern. The algorithm terminates when no further successful extensions are found.

Apriori rules must satisfy minimum thresholds on support and confidence at the same time [8,9].

A. Association rule analysis for basic three courses  From the above section, some basic courses (such as: College English, Higher Mathematics and College Physics) usually incur pre-warning credits. Therefore, we use association rule mining to provide more guiding information for basic teaching.

With the data in 06-07 SS, there are 1250 pre-warning students, of which 601 students cannot pass 2 or 3 these three basic courses. These 601 records are used to mine association rules. Set support=0.3, confidence=0.5, the mined results are given as Table I.

TABLE I. ASSOCIATION RULES AMONG BASIC COURSES  No LHS RHS Support Confidence  1 College Physics Higher Mathematics 0.60 0.78  2 College English Higher Mathematics 0.55 0.76  3 Higher Mathematics College Physics 0.60 0.73  4 College English College Physics 0.50 0.69  5 Higher Mathematics College English 0.55 0.67  College English, College Physics  Higher Mathematics 0.33 0.66  7 College Physics College English 0.50 0.64  College English,  Higher Mathematics College Physics 0.33 0.59  Higher Mathematics, College Physics  College English 0.33 0.54  The results in Table I show there are association relationships among them. For a student to take a course, this taken course may cause another failing course. For example, the rule 3 of Table I is explained as there are 363 students failing in College Physics of 498 pre-warning students, who also fail in Higher Mathematic. That is, a student failing in Higher Mathematic has 73% possibility to failing in College Physics. There are 60% students failing in both two courses.

From these rules, we find that three basic courses are potentially relevant and mutually influencing.

B. Association rule  analysis for major courses  There is a course "Engineering Mechanics" that ranks 16th among the pre-warning courses in 05-06 SS. However, this course ranks 2nd in School of Materials Science and Metallurgy of the selected university. In this school, there are only three specialties (Inorganic Non-Metallic Materials Engineering, Metallurgical Engineering, and Metallic Materials Engineering), where this course is taken by students in the fourth semester. Moreover, this course ranks 1st in the incurring pre-warning courses in these three specialties.

With the pre-warning score data of Metallurgical Engineering Specialty, the association rules among the pre- warming courses are uncovered. "Engineering Mechanics? is regarded as class attribute, the other antecedent courses as normal attributes. MCN1, MCN2?MCN14 denotes each course in the mining process; MCN14 is ?Engineering Mechanics?. We set support =0.12, confidence=0.8. The mined rules are given as Table II.

TABLE II. SOME ASSOCITAION RULES AMONG THE MAJOR COURSES  No LHS RHS Support Confidence  1 MCN11 MCN14 0.22 1  2 MCN12 MCN14 0.17 1  3 MCN2,MCN4 MCN14 0.17 1  4 MCN2,MCN8 MCN14 0.15 1  5 MCN13 MCN14 0.13 1  6 MCN2,MCN9 MCN14 0.13 1  7 MCN2,MCN12 MCN14 0.13 1  8 MCN4,MCN9 MCN14 0.13 1  9 MCN2,MCN4,MCN6 MCN14 0.13 1  10 MCN3,MCN6 MCN14 0.15 0.88  11 MCN4,MCN6 MCN14 0.15 0.88  12 MCN2 MCN14 0.28 0.87  13 MCN2,MCN3 MCN6 0.13 0.86  14 MCN2,MCN3 MCN14 0.13 0.86  15 MCN8,MCN9 MCN14 0.13 0.86  16 MCN4,MCN6,MCN14 MCN2 0.13 0.86  17 MCN3 MCN14 0.24 0.85  18 MCN4 MCN14 0.22 0.83  19 MCN2,MCN6 MCN14 0.20 0.82  20 MCN4,MCN14 MCN2 0.17 0.80  From Table II, we find most courses have association with MCN14 (Engineering Mechanics). From this table, we learn that MCN2 (College Physics), MCN11 (Metallography & Heat Treatment) and MCN12 (Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics) appear particularly important in promoting MCN14 teaching. These rules also show that some antecedent courses are very critical to the subsequent courses in some specialties.



V. CONCLUSION  This paper presents a score data analytical process. With statistical analysis and data mining, some hidden patterns of the pre-warning students are well uncovered. This kind of study is a well data analysis model to make use of a large amount of data in teaching and management in universities.

The discovered patterns or rules can be used to effectively promote education management and improve college education quality.
