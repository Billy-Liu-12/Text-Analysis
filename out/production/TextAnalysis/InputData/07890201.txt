Big Data Analysis in Hotel Customer Response and  Evaluation based on Cloud

Abstract? Traveling has always been a popular way of relaxation.

With the ongoing stress cause by work and daily labours, the need of reducing stress via traveling has grown immensely, making trips a major part of human life. The core of vacation is to relax not only the body, but also the soul. However, there are so many information scattered around the internet, making it very hard to pin point the perfect hotel. This paper provides a solution based on cloud computing combined with big data. By gathering and sorting the information on the web, then analysing and ranking the results, they can be shown in a way that is easy to read and understand. The research started with the implementation of a cloud server and installing software, then gather information on the internet for processing, the next stop is programing the code for cloud computation, and at last, design the web UI for data presentation. At first, the cloud server is equipped with Hadoop [13] for distributed computing. After installation, WebCrawler [15] is used to gather information and review from the internet, then using neural network and unsupervised learning to teach the server how to break down the reviews. Through analysing these results to understand the emotions behind the sentences, transforming it into data for Hadoop to do distributed computing.

Lastly, using K-means [6] algorithm to sort all the data, and updating the database every day. This solution combines a lot of popular technologies, sorting the cluttered reviews of hotels on the internet, making them easier to read and understand. Allowing travelers to easily pick out the perfect hotel for their needs.

I. INTRODUCTION Nowadays, due to innovations in the industry, ?cloud?  becomes a popular topic among many companies. Cloud platform can be used to establish the public cloud, private cloud, hybrid cloud, or social cloud. In addition, service models like infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service(PaaS), and software as a service (SaaS) are all examples of application of clouds.

Most data today are stored on public clouds like Google drive or Dropbox. However, since users are using services provided by a company, the privacy and data protection is a major issue.

In addition, based on the progression of cloud, big data becomes a major topic. In many categories, the data for further processing is too huge for a single computer to calculate.

Therefore, applying cloud computing and clustering multiple computers to enable parallel process has become the solution.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the literature review. Section 3 shows the proposed system structure of solution for review collection and analysis.

Implementation is explained in section 4. The conclusion is given in section 5.



II. LITERATURE REVIEW  A. Hadoop Hadoop [13] is a cloud computation platform used to process  and store massive amount of data [10]. it is part of Apache?s Top-Level Project. Hadoop includes Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), MapReduce structure, and HBase.

HDFS [12] will organize scattered data into an environment with high fault tolerance, great efficiency, and massive capacity.

MapReduce [10] is divided into 2 parts, Map and Reduce.

Map turns the inputs into many parts, distributing them to multiple nodes for computing. Reduce then collects the parts and combining them back together for output.

HBase [8] is a NoSQL database that runs under HDFS, it has high availability, efficiency, and easy expansion of capacity.

Figure 1 shows the structure of Hadoop.

It can tap into multiple databases for results. The WebCrawler can be based on Python and allows more variant results.

WebCrawler, first formed from Googles? search engine, is low-threshold and old technology. It uses HTTP protocol?s search command and regular expressions [7]. Then, a sites? useful data can be picked out. The flow chart is shown as Figure 2.

Figure 2. WebCrawler flow chart [14].

C. Python Python is an interpreted and object oriented programing  language. It can be executed under most operating system [5].

All functions, modules, numbers, strings are objects in  Python. It means that these function, etc., can be inherited, overloaded, and polymorphed. It also enhances the usability of the original code. Compared to function-based languages such as Lisp, Python has the limited support towards function design.

With only two standard libraries, functools and itertools, having function-like tools.

Even though Python can be considered as a script language, a lot of big scale projects like Google are still using Python.

Python?s followers often calls it a high-level dynamic programing language, since most script languages such as shell script or VBScript are only used for simple tasks. Python?s structure is shown in Figure 3.

D. Neural Network A neural network is a calculation model based on how a  biological-neural network would process and calculate data. It has the ability to do parallel processes, a high tolerance to faults, and Associative Memory. Recurrent and Feed forward are the two main structure of neural network.

A recurrent structure?s process is as follows: 1) During the learning stage, it will detect the part of  the question that needs to be memorized.

2) Decide the weight of it through a Hebbian Learning  machine.

3) At the recall stage, it will find if the presented  question has something in common with the data in its memory.

A feed forward structure [14] works like this: 1) During the learning stage, users will provide a  question and an answer.

2) By adjusting weight using steepest-descent method,  the system will attempt to output the right answer.

3) At the recall stage, an untrained question will be  proposed. By sorting and predicting the algorithm needed, it will output the most possible answer.

Its structure is as shown in Figure 4.

E. K-means and Lexical Emotional Evaluation K-means is a data mining solution based on vector  quantization and Cluster analysis.

ISBN 978-89-968650-9-4 ICACT2017 February 19 ~ 22, 2017    Its equation is as follows:     K-means will first randomly pick k number of nodes as the cluster centers (u1~uk). Then, the algorithm adds up the shortest distance between each center to node. By using this result, the algorithm continuously re-group each node to a group. The flow chart is shown as Figure 5.

Because of the continued growth at the data processing field,  some researchers tried to add lexical emotional evaluation to improve on the system?s accuracy. Based on the emotion presented behind the words, the collected data can evaluate if the sentence has a positive or a negative tone to it.



III.  PROPOSED HOTEL EVALUATION ANALYSIS SYSTEM The process starts with implementing Hadoop environment  and Hadoop Multi Node Cluster on the cloud server for it to update its database actively. After implementing, a WebCrawler written with Python will gather reviews on the internet and saving it to the server for further analyzation.

The data will first run through jieba text segmentation [2] to allow the system to understand the text and find key adjectives in a review. Then these adjectives will run through Hadoop?s WordCount program for counting the times each word is used. Next, using a Feed-Forward structure neural network [1], the system will be provided with some test inputs and their expected solution based on the data, the network will learn to give each adjective a score between +25 and -25 with a positive number being an adjective with a positive meaning and negative number with a negative adjective. After every test, the system will do small adjustments to the weight of each word and the adjustment itself. Things like how much to adjust and  the sensitivity of adjustments are all being changed with each test. After multiple processes, the final answer will start to be much more similar to the expected output. With the system understanding if the word has either a positive or negative tone and how strong the emotion is based on the score. Forming a basic table of the weight of each adjective.

Next, using K-means, the system will group different adjective into clusters. With every word in the cluster having the same weight. By setting the number of clusters(k). To  minimize the result of , meaning sum of the distance between every node(xj) and the centers (ui) must be minimized. The goal is to find the cluster with the best center and node, and as the result, optimize data classification. For this system, this means to optimize the weight of each adjective.

Finally calculating a score based on the average score of the hotel and the number of reviews. Lastly, the results will be shown in a website for users to view. The flow chart and structure of the system is shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7.

IV.  IMPLEMENTATION Stating with WebCrawer, the system will gather reviews on  the internet and transforming them into data for Hadoop to process as shown in Figure 8.

Figure 8. Transforming reviews into data using WebCrawer.

Using Hadoop MapReduce in conjunction with jieba text segmentation, the paragraph will be cut into individual vocabularies and counted as shown in Figure 9.

Figure 9. Result of WordCount after jieba text segmentation.

These vocabularies will next run through a neural network for weighting. Words like ?Awesome?, ?Nice?, and ?Great? will be given a positive score while vocabularies like ?Awful, ?Bad?, and ?Expensive? will be assign with a negative score, K-means will group similar words together for analysis as shown in Figure 10. Figure 11 shows some example scores generated by reviews based on these vocabularies.

Lastly, these hotels will be ranked with others in the same area. Figure 12 is the result of the proposed system.

V.  CONCLUSIONS This paper proposed a system to evaluate a hotel based on  reviews from multiple websites. By analysing and processing the text, the system can make the reviews into a graph that is easy to read and understand. By intelligent learning, the system allows the user to understand how well the hotel effortlessly.

With some tweaking, the system can be customized to the user?s needs.
