An Improved Pre-Processing Technique with Image  Mining Approach for the Medical Image

Abstract -- The proposed system mainly concentrates on the diagnosis of brain tumor from the CT-Scan (Computerized Tomography) brain images. This work gives the neuroradiologist a second option for the easy identification of tumor cells from the brain image. The important data mining concept that has been included in the proposed work consists of pre-processing of the CT- Scan brain image. The method used for pre-processing includes Shape priori technique. The feature selection from the brain image has been done using the association rule mining. The rules generated for extracted features are stored in the transactional database have been classified using the data mining concept called Decision Tree Classification. The combination of both the association rule mining and the decision tree classification gives the high degree of accuracy and efficiency for the proposed system.

Keywords ?Data mining, Image mining, Shape priori algorithm, Association Rule Mining, Decision Tree Classification.



I. INTRODUCTION  Medical diagnoses of brain tumor from the brain tissues were very important in medical treatments of brain cancer. There exist many types of techniques for the detection of brain tumor [1] for instance conventional radiology, ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, computerized tomography and etc.

Among the various types of screening procedures, computer aided position Emission tomography provides the cost effective, lass radiation and accurate identification of brain tumor.

The process of diagnosing a number of CT-Scan images after analysis becomes tiresome and more consequently susceptible to errors. Hence a computer aided diagnosis (CAD) system can be used to assists the physician?s as a second option to reduce the mistakes and errors [2]. Thus, in medical centers and in hospitals building CAD system is becoming of high important.

Pre-processing of images is an essential task in the field of object based motion estimation, medical image processing, computer vision, etc. In order to analyze the object properties,   Pre-processing techniques have been used t o isolate the desired object from the image [3] [4]. The medical image pre- processing is a challenging problem. Its results are needed for the estimation of boundary of an object, classification of tissue abnormalities, shape analysis, contour detection and texture segmentation. Several diagnoses are based on the proper pre- processing of digitized image.

Feature selection is a classical problem in the field of statistics, and also an important topic in machine learning which is mainly studied from the perspective of statistics and information processing. According to the mode of combining the learning algorithm, the existing feature selection strategies [5] can be mainly categorized into three groups: embedded methods filter methods and wrapper methods [6]. In the proposed work, a great effort to apply association rule mining techniques to solve feature selection problems, and attempt to produce a small size feature subtypes that is acceptable for classification tasks.
