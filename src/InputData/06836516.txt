Abstract?As the first interplanetary mission managed by the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) had three IT security goals for its ground system:  COMPLIANCE, (IT) RISK REDUCTION, and COST REDUCTION.  In a multi- organizational environment in which government, industry and academia work together in support of the ground system and mission operations, information security governance, risk management, and compliance (GRC) becomes a challenge as each component of the ground system has and follows its own set of IT security requirements.  These requirements are not necessarily the same or even similar to each other?s, making the auditing of the ground system security a challenging feat.

A combination of standards-based information security management based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Risk Management Framework (RMF), due diligence by the Mission?s leadership, and effective collaboration among all elements of the ground system enabled MAVEN to successfully meet NASA?s requirements for IT security, and therefore meet Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) mandate on the Agency.

Throughout the implementation of GRC on MAVEN during the early stages of the mission development, the Project faced many challenges some of which have been identified in this paper.  The purpose of this paper is to document these challenges, and provide a brief analysis of the lessons MAVEN learned.  The historical information documented herein, derived from an internal pre-launch lessons learned analysis, can be used by current and future missions and organizations implementing and auditing GRC.
