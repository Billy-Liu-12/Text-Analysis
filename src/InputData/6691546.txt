Abstract  It may sound contradictory to use humans to analyze big data, since humans cannot process huge amounts of data, may be error prone and are relatively slow. However, humans can do certain tasks much better than machines, e.g., tasks that involve image analysis or natural language.

In this talk I will discuss how humans can be judiciously used to improve data analytics by cleansing, clustering and filtering critical data. I will also briefly describe ongoing work at our Stanford InfoLab in this area  Biography  Hector Garcia-Molina is the Leonard Bosack and Sandra Lerner Professor in the Departments of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at Stanford University, Stanford, California. He was the chairman of the Computer Science Department from January 2001 to December 2004. From 1997 to 2001 he was a member the President's Information Technology Advisory Committee (PITAC). From 1979 to 1991 he was on the faculty of the Computer Science Department at Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey. He received a BS in electrical engineering from the Instituto Tecnologico de Monterrey, Mexico, in 1974. From Stanford University, Stanford, California, he received in 1975 a MS in electrical engineering and a PhD in computer science in 1979. He holds an honorary PhD from ETH Zurich (2007).
