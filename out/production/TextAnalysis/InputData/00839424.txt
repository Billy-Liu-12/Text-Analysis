Mining Bases for Association Rules Using Closed Sets

Abstract We address the problem of the usefulness and the relevance of the set of discovered association rules. Using the fre- quent closed itemset groundwork, we propose to generate bases for association rules, that are non-redundant gener- ating sets for all association rules.

1. Introduction Association rules are conditional implications between  frequent itemsets. The problem of the usefulness and the relevance of the set of discovered association rules is re- lated to the huge number of rules extracted and the presence of many redundancies among these rules for many datasets.

We address this important problem using the Galois con- nection framework and we show that we can generate bases for association rules using the frequent closed itemsets ex- tracted by the Close [4] or the A-Close [5] algorithms.

2. Galois connection framework The association rule extraction is performed from a data  mining context that is a triplet D = (O; I;R), where O and I are finite sets of objects and items respectively, and R ? O ? I is a binary relation. Each couple (o; i) 2 R denotes the fact that the object o 2 O is related to the item i 2 I. The closure operator h of the Galois connection [1] is the composition of the application f , that associates with O ? O the items common to all objects o 2 O, and the ap- plication g, that associates with an itemset I ? I the objects related to all items i 2 I . The closure operator h = f ?g as- sociates with I the maximal set of items common to all the objects containing I , i.e. the intersection of these objects.

Using this closure operator, we define the frequent closed itemsets that constitute a minimal non-redundant generat- ing set for all frequent itemsets and their support, and thus for all association rules, their support and their confidence.

This property comes from the fact that the support of a fre- quent itemset is equal to the support of its closure and that the maximal frequent itemsets are maximal frequent closed itemsets [4, 5].

Definition 1 (Frequent closed itemsets) A frequent item- set I is a frequent closed itemset iff h(I) = I . The smallest (minimal) closed itemset containing an itemset I is h(I), i.e.

the closure of I . We denote FC the set of frequent closed itemsets in D.

3. Bases for association rules We adapt the Duquenne-Guigues basis for global impli-  cations [2, 1] and the Luxenburger basis for partial impli- cations [3] to the exact association rules (100% confidence rules) and the approximate association rules respectively.

Theorem 1 (Duquenne-Guigues basis) A frequent pseu- do-closed itemset is a frequent itemset that is not closed and that contains the closures of all its subsets that are fre- quent pseudo-closed itemsets. Let FP be the set of frequent pseudo-closed itemsets in D. The Duquenne-Guigues ba- sis for exact association rules contains all rules of the form I1 ! (I2 n I1) for I1 2 FP , I2 2 FC and h(I1) = I2.

Theorem 2 (Luxenburger basis) The Luxenburger basis for approximate association rules contains all rules of the form I1 ! (I2 nI1) for I1; I2 2 FC and I1 ? I2. The tran- sitive reduction of this basis, i.e. for I1 ? I2 and @I3 2 FC such as I1 ? I3 ? I2, is also a basis for all approximate association rules.

All approximate association rules, their support and their confidence can be deduced from the Luxenburger basis, or its reduction, and all exact association rules can be deduced from the Duquenne-Guigues basis. They are minimal non redundant sets of association rules.
