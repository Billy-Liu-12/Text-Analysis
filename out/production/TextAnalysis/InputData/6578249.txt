Geo-Pathogenic Zones as a Social Task  Outdoor and Indoor Cartography Technology

Abstract?Recent statistical accumulated data strongly indicate that long?term exposure to geo-pathogenic zones, GPZ, can result in serious impact on human health. The list of related diseases is broad, including cancer atop. Moreover, GPZs contribute to the road accidents due to their influence on the performance of the drivers.

For this reason, cartography of regular and irregular GPZs is an important social mission, requiring indoor and outdoor mapping systems, both of them have GPZ detecting instrument like Spinning Electric Vector Analyzer, SEVA. The indoor mapping systems necessitate steady centimeter resolution due to the width of GPZ line count as order of 20-21 cm. They are intended to reveal inauspicious patterns inside a human dwelling. Limited size of the dwelling implies participation of a trained operator and a manual mode of mapping. In contrary to the indoor monitoring, the outdoor one is intended for big spaces like backyards, lawns, parks, highways as well as other public places.

Different approaches to both methods, in particular ? position sensors, GPS interaction and other details of both technologies are considered in this paper.



I. INTRODUCTION This Numerous amount of facts witnessing the harm inflicted by Geo Pathogenic Zones in different countries accumulated thus far by researchers [1, pp.267-299; 2].

GPZs can be subdivided to three major categories:  1. Regular GPZ caused by natural Earth?s energy grids;  2. Irregular GPZs caused by subterranean waters, geo- faults and other irregular structural heterogeneities;  3. Artifacts caused by the human activities.

As theoretical developments and experiments show all three types of GPZs are united in developing specific spinning electromagnetic fields as well as extremely low frequency fields.

The first category manifests itself as well known Curry, - Hartmann and other grids [1, pp. 345-350]. They are very stable periodic structures with calculated dimensions depending on a geographic longitude. Their physical origination is still being discussed [1-4]. The width of lines forming such grids varies within 20-21 cm.

The second category is associated with vast subterranean irregularities and sometimes looks controversial: prospecting underground water is very important social task, whereas, the underground waters are also sources of some by-side  unwanted processes like generating harmful fields and emanation of radon.

The third category GPZ is associated with the human activities: erected constructions are the cause of specific harmful distortions of electromagnetic fields, also underground communications act as geo-faults ?.

GPZs produce extremely low frequency electric fields, ELF [2] it was shown in 1975 by Robert Beck, that ELF can cause brainwave entrainment, this was supported experimentally.

Another aspect of the work [2] is in that GPZs produce spinning electromagnetic fields, which, in turn produce specific Torsion Fields, hence can impact space-time metric with following serious local consequences.

Various forms of the spinning fields in proximity of different objects are shown in Fig.1.

Specially developed instrument, Spinning Electric Vector Analyzer, SEVA was the first one designed for detection of electromagnetic spinning as a source of GPZ [5].

II. CATEGORIES OF GPZ-MAPPING GPZ cartography can be subdivided for indoor and outdoor, and both are socially important.

The indoor mapping serves to bring awareness and prevent people from extended exposures of both regular and irregular manifestation of local GPZs within their dwellings.

Fig.2 shows regular GPZ-lines projected onto exposed human bodies which affect the corresponding organs.  In that case, an operator of special equipment has to show to residents a         map of their dwelling with superimposed regular GPZ grids as well as possible GPZ-irregularities. For instance, sometimes it?s enough to move a bed from the crossing GPZ lines into a space between them to protect the person from a serious risk.

Fig.2 illustrates the danger of exposure of humans to energy lines of GPZ, [2]. The organ of a human body, crossed by the line is most vulnerable to progression risk of disease.  The figure shows two kinds of grids, 1 and 2, where continuous exposure to their crossing is most dangerous for humans.

Statistics of influence of GPZs on human health indicate that long-term dwelling in these zones increases the risk of cancer up to 5 times! [2].

The outdoor mapping of GPZ is conducted on a much larger scale with faster scanning rate, with main tasks of revealing bad zones. These zones are intersections of GPZ with roadways, which have statistically higher rate of accidents [1].

For instance, according to data of [6, 7] on Baltic countries, traffic accidents, TA, have the following statistics per 1km:   TA with victims in neutral zones: 0.877; TA with victims in GPZ: 4.151. The lethal statistics per 1 km is following: TA in neutral zones: 0.158; TA in GPZ: 0.909.

In Europe regulating this problem had been legislated, and a measure to notify drivers about danger of these places initiated by Verona Declaration of the European Union in 2003 had been undertaken.

Specific physical differences between indoor and outdoor GPZ-cartography, such as influence of image charges in a wet soil is important for the outdoor mapping, while the indoor mapping operating inside dry dwellings would not encounter this problem.



III. INDOOR MAPPING The indoor mapping is characterized in relatively small scale with a slow scanning rate. Unlike the outdoor mapping, the indoor requires high resolution since the width of GPZ line is about 21 cm.

One of possible realization of the indoor mapping is shown in Fig.3.  The installation comprises of an instrument  like SEVA, having a special feedback from its processor to a laser which sends a beam through a hole in the sensor onto the floor. The laser shots a pulse of light which leaves a spot on the floor. The panoramic photo camera installed above, operating in a delay shot mode, develops an integrated picture of the session.

Fig.3. General Allocation of equipment for indoor GPZ  mapping Presence of the operator will be also visible in the integrated picture of the camera as a scattered object. However, this effect can be drastically reduced by means of placing a filter before a lens of the camera or wearing a special dark cloth of the operator. Presence of the operator also will be visible in integrated picture developed by the camera as a scattered object. However, this can be eliminated by a simple method: installing a color filter before the lens of the camera. In this case the picture of the room is made two times: without the color filter in a regular mode, followed by the delayed mode session picture with the filter. The bandwidth of the filter corresponds to the wavelength of the laser beam subsequently both images are superimposed on each other. Wearing a dark cloth also will reduce unwanted effect of presence of the operator.

IV. OUTDOOR MAPPING In the outdoor mapping, specific features like a vast scale of the monitoring, relatively high rate scanning, influence of image charges, affect the results.

The specifics of the outcomes utilized in design of the GPZ- scanning instrument.

The photo camera technology cannot be directly employed here. However, it?s still possible to employ a teased air balloon with the photo camera for limited areas like one squared mile.

For the bigger scale, GPS technology combined with the scanning instrument can be employed.

Fig.6 shows a simplified presentation of such an approach.

It?s also possible to engage specially trained animals like dogs for scanning approximate hundred meters square areas: GPZ-scanner, GPS receiver and a data transmitter are attached to a dog?s collar. As running back and forth in a scan-like approach on a field, the dog transmits signals from the collar-attached instruments to a remote processor which develops an integrated GPZ- cartography of the scanned area.



V. CONCLUSION 1. Both regular and irregular GPZs are an extreme  social hazard especially in areas of dense population.

2. Regular GPZ- scanning of human dwellings and public  places is required in order to be avoided hence to prevent possible dangerous diseases.

3. ?Black spots? on roads has to be scanned and marked country-wide, for public awareness.

4. SEVA instrument, detecting spinning electromagnetic fields, as an adequate means of GPZ-scanner, for public knowledge and alertness.

5. Indoor GPZ- mapping, employing a delayed shot mode panoramic camera atop, combined and controlled with a laser marker on the GPZ-instrument as crucial techniques to detect and prevent exposure to bad spots for extended period of time.

6. The outdoor GPZ-mapping for roadways can be realized with mobile means carrying GPZ-scanner, GPS-receiver and data transmitter to send the data about coordinates and spinning electromagnetic fields, as well as ELF? activity to a processor which develops an integrated GPZ-cartography.

7. The outdoor GPZ-mapping for limited areas of one squared mile can be done with a teased air balloon carrying the camera and the GPZ scanner having a powerful light marker. For more limited areas like meadows and lawns, specially trained animals, carrying the set of GPZ ?scanning instruments and GPS, can be deployed.
