Association Rule Analysis of Spatial Data Mining Based on Matlab  ??A Case of Ancheng Township in China

Abstract   Though there are many methods for spatial data  mining?it is also a desirable problem that how to carry out this operation fast. Matlab is called full-purpose calculation paper. And it has certain advantage in carrying out data mining because of its powerful matrix calculation function. According to the association rule method of data mining, spatial data of land use and slope was processed and extracted on Geographic Information System(GIS) at first, and data mining was performed by the program, which was wrote in M-language of Matlab. The study area was Ancheng township in Shandong province of China. The confidence and the support between different land use types and slope levels were mined, and the association rules were set up. Through the empirical study, it has been proved that this study method is feasible and the conclusion can provide instruction for local land use planning.

1. Introduction  Data mining is a new method to discover knowledge from mass data. At present, researchers prefer to use special tools of data mining, such as Clementine and DBMiner, to perform it[1?2?3], but rarely use Matlab as the mining tool. Matlab is a kind of engineering mathematical software, and it has been applied in many fields because of its powerful data-process function [4?5?6?7]. There is plentiful spatial data about land use and it is a new idea that making use of the powerful function of Matlab to deal with the mass data. Forasmuch we have made the attempt of association rule mining in Matlab on base of great test  work. In this study, we wrote association rule mining program coded by M-language in Matlab[8], performed the association rule mining between land use data of Ancheng in 2004 and slope data, and aimed to find out the association rule between the distribution of land use type and slope in the study area. We expect that this study should provide decision-making reference for land use planning and land use structure optimizing in local area and other similar region.

2. Methods 2.1. Study area and data resources  The study area is Ancheng township of Pingyin county in Shandong province in China and it is in the southwest of Jinan city. This township lies to the west part of Taishan Mountain and the lower reaches of Yellow River, and has monsoonal climate of warm temperate zone, and it is a foothill. It is 65 km2 around, and there are 65 villages, and 4397 doors, 16067 persons in all. Figure 1 shows the location of Ancheng township.

Figure 1.The location of study area    2008 Workshop on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining  DOI 10.1109/WKDD.2008.21   2008 Workshop on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining  DOI 10.1109/WKDD.2008.21   2008 Workshop on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining  DOI 10.1109/WKDD.2008.21   2008 Workshop on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining  DOI 10.1109/WKDD.2008.21   2008 Workshop on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining  DOI 10.1109/WKDD.2008.21     Because of its special geographic location, there are kinds of land use types in Ancheng township.

According to the land classification criterion in China [9], there are 24 land use types in the study area, and they distribute in different topographic forms. Because of the technical methods and other limitations, people?s knowledge of land use mode in different topographic forms is fuzzy. Nowadays, we pursue a high efficient utilization mode of land resource, so the fuzzy cognition must be improved under the support of advanced concept and technical method, then the comprehensive production ability of land resource may be exploited better.

The data we used comes from: 1) the production of Ancheng 1:10000 land use renewed survey database in 2004, which is in .tab format of MapInfo. It makes the foundation for land use data process. There are 1894 land parcels in this township, and each parcel has 31 attribute fields, so the land use database has 58714 attribute fields in all. If added the spatial location coordinate data and the geometric character data of the parcel, the data size is much larger. 2) the 1:10000 geographical map of Ancheng in 2004, which is in .dwg format of AutoCAD. We use it to derive and grade slope.

In 2004, there are 45.04 km2 agricultural land, 6.09 km2 construction land, and 14.30 km2 idle land in Ancheng township. Cultivated land, forest land, land for water facilities and idle land account for 50.25%, 12.33%, 1.21% and 21.86%, separately. The characteristic of cultivated land?s makeup is that dry land (accounting for 83.92%) is the most, followed by paddy field (15.38%) and land for vegetables (0.70%).

2.2. Data processing 2.2.1. Data pre-processing. The general procedure of data mining is: question raise ? data preparation (including data selection, data pretreatment and data transformation) ? data arrangement ? model building/data mining ? result evaluation and explanation. Data preparation is the key which determines the success of data mining. The process of spatial data is much more complex. In order to realize mining objects, the technical methods applied in data process of this study are as following.

(1) Obtaining the slope data The topographic data we have does not contain  slope data, so we need to extract it from obtained data and materials. In topographic database, the elevation points and their label information are known to us.

Under this condition, through fully analyzing the structure of topographic data in AutoCAD and the requirement of spatial data in GIS, we program by  MapBasic V7.0 in order to extract the discrete elevation point and their labels from .dwg file.

Furthermore, we change the label texts to the attributes of elevation points. The transformed data can be used to build DEM and then derive slope by GIS software easily [10?11]. The specific procedure is as following.

a) Use FME [12] to transform .dwg file of AutoCAD into .tab file of MapInfo.

b) Program by MapBasic to make elevation points and their labels in topographic files match automatically.

c) Check the error in MapInfo.

d) Transform .tab file of MapInfo into .shp file of  ArcView by FME.

e) In ArcView, use ?derive slope? that is under the  menu of ?surface? to generate the slope map directly.

Figure 2 shows the slope map of the study area. In our study, slope levels 0,1,2,3,4,5 denote slope range that is <2?,2?- 6?,6?- 10?,10?- 15?,15?- 25?and >= 25?,separately.

f) Transform the slope data into .xls file of Excel for the next operation.

(2) Obtaining the land use data a) Export the 1:10000 land use database in 2004  to .xls file by table export function in MapInfo.

b) Integrate the slope data and land use data in Excel,  and build up the data resource for the next data mining in Matlab. Table 1 displays the data structure of part fields in data resource.

Basic principle and calculation of association rules. Association rules mining is finding out the patterns whose appearance probabilities are much higher than any other transaction to instruct the decision-making. In nature, it is a simplification of conditional probability and joint probability [13].

The basic principles and concepts of association rule are as the following:  I ( { }miiiI ,...,, 21= ) is a group of items and D ( { }ntttD ,...,, 21= ) is a transaction database.

{ }ikiii IIIt ,...,, 21= , and II ij ? . An association rule is an implication formula such as YX ? . In this formula, X and Y are called itemset which is composed of items, and ?=?YX .

In transaction database D , if there are %s transactions that contain YX ? , then the support of association rule YX ?  is %s , and it is recorded as %)(sup sYXport =? . We can see that the support of YX ?  is the percentage of the transaction containing YX ?  in D . In this way,  )()(sup YXPYXport ?=? .

If the ratio of transactions containing YX ?  to  transactions containing X is %c , then the confidence of association rule YX ?  is %c . So,  )()( XYPYXconfidence =?  [14].

Support and confidence of an association rule are  method to measure its interest [15]. Moreover, support is an importance criterion (or applicability criterion) for association rule. In other word, we can see the representative degree of the association rule in all transactions through it. On the other hand, confidence weighs the veracity degree of the association rule [16?17].

According to the above concept description and analysis, by taking the land use database of Ancheng township in 2004 as the example, we programmed in Matlab to calculate support and confidence of association rule ?land use type? slope?, and made preparations to discover the association between land use type and slope.

2.2.3. Exploring data in Matlab. On the basis of the algorithm of association rule[12?14], we programmed to complete the calculation in virtue of M-language in Matlab. The specific procedure is as following.

(1) Take advantage of ?import wizard? in Matlab to accomplish the import of data file. Until now, the data  matrix has been established. In Matlab, numerical fields and character fields are saved separately. For example, the default uses a matrix named ?data? to keep numerical fields and a matrix named ?textdata? to keep character fields.

(2) Run the association rule program to calculate total area of study area, area of each land use type at every slope level and the area ratio, support, and confidence separately. Figure 3 illustrates the program segment in Matlab.

Figure 3. Program segment in Matlab   (3) Repeat the above steps until we have got the  satisfactory result. The final results are showed in table 2.

3. Results and discussion   As showed in table 2, X denotes the land use type and Y denotes the slope level.

(1) At the slope level 0, the kinds of land use types are more than any other level. The land area at this slope level is 29.01 km2, accounting for 49.43% of entire study area. There are 24 kinds of land use types in study area in which there are 21 kinds whose confidences are highest at this slope level. In addition, their supports are all between 49% and 50%.

The confidences of land for vegetables and land for rural residential areas at this slope level are 73.80% and 63.01% separately. We can see the production and living of people in this region concentrate on the land where the slope is less than 2?.

Meanwhile, at this slope level, the area of wild grass ground is the largest, accounting for 35.24% of total wild grass ground. Woodland is in the next place, accounting for 21.71% of total woodland.

(2) The confidence of irrigable land is the tiptop (58.74%) at the slope range of 2?-6?, while its support is 22.57%. Limited by topographic condition, there is little irrigable land at the slope level 4 and 5 where the slope is more than 15?.

At this slope range, dry land distributes more widely than any other range. It is indicated that the slope influence on land use has changed regularly as the increasing of slope.

(4) The confidence of livestock land is the tiptop (51.93%) at the slope range of 10?-15?, while its support is 9.60%.

(5) On the land where the slope is less than 2?, there is more woodland while it is shrubbery where slope is more than 15?. It is showed that the effect of reforestation is explicit.

(6) Land for mining is most at the slope level 0 (support is 95.41% and confidence is 49.36%). The secondary is at the slope between 10?and 15?. There is little land for mining where the slope is more than 15?.

We can see that the industry in this area is depending on resource. That is to say, the industry distribution is related with the resources distribution. Where the slope is soft, there are more factories for resources machining, while there are more factories for mineral resources machining where the slope is hard.

4. Conclusion and suggestion   (1) We have got the expectant result to do data mining in Matlab. Compared with special data mining tools, Matlab can improve the efficiency of data process in case that it has strong and well-suited matrix calculation function. This study has put forward a feasible method for the association analysis of multi-dimension data.

(2) We have done the data mining of non-spatial data after transforming and processing spatial data, and gotten the conclusion which has spatial characteristic.

It is a new attempt for spatial data mining. Through our experiment, the application extension of Matlab has been broadened, and more kinds of data have been used in data mining. What is more, we have found more general rules and modes to support decision-making.

(3) Through the data mining of land use in hilly region?Ancheng township, we see that most of the utilized land is distributing on land where the slope is less than 2?,and production and living of people in this region mainly concentrate on plain land. The idle land in this township accounts for 21.86% of the entire region, and mainly distributes at the slope level 0. The local government should implement land exploitation and consolidation, and develop agriculture and industry  actively. Forest planting work in this township should also be strengthened because forest is lack at the slope level 4 and 5. The above conclusions are all directive to local land use planning.

(4) True spatial data mining should be carried out in pure spatial database. In order to prove the practicability of Matlab in data mining, this study just has done the primary experiment. The next attempt is to treat Matlab as a component or the exterior program of spatial data mining software aiming to carry through the true spatial data mining [18], or to implement spatial data mining directly in the environment of Matlab.
