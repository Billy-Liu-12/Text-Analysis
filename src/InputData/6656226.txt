Power Data Fusion for Train and Railway  Electrification System

Abstract? The reduction of energy consumption in electric trains is a big challenge of the next years. Lower consumptions means a more convenient design of the electric power supply network of the trains; in particular increasing the margin between peak demand and maximum power limit of the network improves the overall reliability. To this aim, the energy recovered from braking of one train may be used to aid the acceleration of the same or another train. Recovering energy from braking is a well-known idea, and the possibility to exchange energy between breaking trains and departing trains is very attractive. With this goal in mind the train vectors need to exchange information about their instantaneous power consumption and the data should be available for comparisons in a common time scale. In this paper will be presented an Android based measurement system for electric trains able to make synchronous measurements. The measurement system presented is composed of wireless sensors making it easy to install on modern train vectors.

I. INTRODUCTION Wasting energy is one of the biggest problem of modern  civilization: environmental sustainability and energy savings are fundamental subjects in our society. Energy demand is growing rapidly and forecasts present an energetic request not likely to be sustainable with the modern technologies in energy generation, transport and distribution. The European Union defined essential goals for 2020, among which is stated the increase of the energetic efficiency by 20% with respect to 1990.

Electric trains are more energy-efficient than diesel- powered trains. Moreover if powered by low-carbon generating stations, an electric train can produce a lower carbon dioxide footprint. Electric trains are characterized by simpler mechanics and do not need to carry the weight of fuel.

This is partly offset by the weight of electrical equipment.

Nowadays railway-related consumptions of electric energy have a great impact on the power grid [1]. Moreover they are increasing, due to the rising number of trains operating on the railroad at the same time and to the increase in electric trains average speed (which requires more energy and renewed efforts in safety and control systems). The moderrn trains have  an ample range of variation for energy demand: being a heavy weight system, they absorb a relevant amount of energy when accelerating (especially in the acceleration from still), and in turn have to dissipate a lot of energy to brake. Therefore they produce consumption peaks whose values go way beyond the average electric current: thus all the production plants, transmission and distribution infrastructure need to be sized up to sustain the peak, resulting however oversized for the average demand.

Regenerative braking returns power to the electrification system so that it may be stored locally, or used elsewhere by other trains on the same system or returned to the general power grid. Given a system that is able to both store energy and exchange it with the power grid, it could be possible to smooth the peak electric current consumption: the kinetic energy otherwise wasted during braking of one train can be used by the same or another train that needs a big amount of energy during departures or positive variations of speed. To implement any kind of strategy of energy management like the one just presented, it is required a specific measurement system: there is the need for tracking the train electricity consumption and for coordinating departures and arrivals of the trains in the stations so to reach absorption peaks leveling.

To ensure coordination of energy flows it is necessary to have an energy-buffering system. Nowadays it is possible to store energy in many ways, but the more suitable for train applications seem to be electrochemical storage systems and supercapacitors. Both present advantages and disadvantages.

Among electrochemical storage systems, research is focusing mainly on lithium batteries for their good performances and room for improvements. They present several advantages: compared to other battery technologies, lithium batteries may reach higher specific energy and higher power density. The latter is particularly of interest in the context introduced, since both the charge and discharge electric current may reach high values, not always manageable by other battery technologies. Moreover, the high specific energy means being able to realize lighter trains without sacrificing the storable energy, therefore increasing the overall efficiency.

The supercapacitors differ from regular capacitors for their very high capacitance (rated in farads, thousands of times higher than the typical values for electrolytic capacitors). They     are ideal for energy storage in case of frequent charge and discharge cycles at high electric current and of short duration.

Not being able to hold the charge for a long time, they can be used in the same way of batteries in applications where the charge and discharge are separated by a short time interval.

The modern supercapacitors can withstand up to 2.5-2.7V; higher voltages are possible but they would reduce the service life. The typical charge time of a supercapacitor is about 10 seconds and the charge electric current can usually reach values so high that can generally be considered limited by the charger. The charge characteristic is similar to the case of electrochemical batteries: the initial charge can be made very fast resorting to constant electric current, and the topping charge will take extra time and generally happens at constant voltage. The supercapacitor cannot go into overcharge and does not require full-charge detection: the electric current simply stops flowing when the capacitor is full. The supercapacitor can be charged and discharged virtually an unlimited number of times. Unlike the electrochemical battery, which has a defined cycle life, there is little wear off by cycling a supercapacitor. Nor does age affect the device as heavily as it would in case of a battery: under normal conditions, in a service life of 10 years, supercapacitor capacity typically fades by just 20 percent. Finally, the supercapacitor works well at high and low temperatures.

This paper presents various problems related to a measurement system that implements synchronous measures for trains. The main topic of the paper is to describe a system that is able to monitor the trains and to collect data useful to optimize the energy flow. This measurement system can acquire the value of electric current, voltage and coordinate positions of trains simultaneously: these information are available for fusion and then for a possible optimization of the energy flows. Each train is equipped with an acquisition system for onboard measurements and the electrical substation  is equipped with its own acquisition system: they all manage to execute synchronous measurements. They then communicate their data to a central server which merges and refers to the same time scale the measurements coming from all the different sources.

The software is implemented on Android platform, and all the information are accessible from any portable device, like Android smartphones and tablets.

The measurement system proposed adds to similar systems available on the market, like the train energy measurement system produced by FAR Systems [5], for its ability to acquire synchronized data and to entitle several mobile devices to access the information. Moreover, being Android-based, it is cheaper and more flexible.



II. THE PROBLEM The implemented system is intended to manage the energy  flows between different trains so to increase the overall efficiency. During train operation, a large amount of energy is spent when the train accelerates from still; therefore, if it were possible to reduce the energy demand to the electric network during this phase, the overall impact on the power grid would be much lower.

The idea is to use the energy recovered from the braking of other trains to propel the subsequent acceleration of the same train or the start of another train [6]. An electric motor may be used as a generator, reversing the transformation of electric energy into torque and, ultimately, kinetic energy. Currently electric trains make use of electric braking [7],[8](not feeding the motors with electric current, they oppose a mechanical resistive torque dependent of the electric impedance seen by the motor) together with the mechanical ones: usually the power so produced is dissipated using resistor banks. Such energy can however be stored for sequent use.

Figure 1: Speed, Power and Drive Force.

The implemented system aims to manage the train energy demand: the train traffic must be managed so that more trains do not start at the same time. To speed up a train at the start it needs a big amount of energy, whereas is possible to take advantage of the trains? ability to generate electricity while braking and transfer that energy to other trains; the motors feed power back and these can be put into the grid or into a storage system.

To intelligently handle the high number of starting and stopping trains a central control system is needed. To put in place the correct management policy, the central control system needs to have at disposal measurements of voltage and electric current absorption of the trains. There is the need for timely measurements: therefore a smart, non-intrusive, time effective measurement system is needed onboard the train.

The proposed architecture exploits the advantages of wireless sensor networks to sense the quantities of interest without the need of re-wiring train coaches. Furthermore different Wi-Fi communication channels can be selected to avoid interference with other Wi-Fi systems inside the train. Relevant data, with particular focus on the curves of electric current and voltage of trains during travel and acceleration/braking, is acquired and sent to a central server.

In Fig. 1 speed, power and drive force curves for a metropolitan train are reported. Metropolitan trains are particularly relevant in the light of the proposed system, since the limited distance among sequent stations determines highly frequent starts and stops.

The graphs in Fig. 1 makes clear the train operation during acceleration and braking. At vehicle departure, while speed gradually increases, the absorbed electric current raises instantly (positive peak) to overcome inertia; on the contrary, while braking, speed gradually decreases, resulting in a reversed absorbed electric current that determines a negative peak. The positive peak represents electric current that has to be provided to the train to depart, and the negative peak represents electric current that can be stored for subsequent use.

In Fig. 2 are reported the load curves, in a three train scenario, for a single train (dashed line) and the total power consumption (red line): Fig. 2a shows the case in which there is no synchronization among trains acceleration and braking (casual case); Fig. 2b instead shows the total load profile attainable when there is synchronization (ideal case). As it can be seen, simply shifting arrival and departure of trains (therefore even in absence of proper storage system) can already be beneficial in reducing load peaks. Of course resorting also to some energy storage system, the load for the power grid is further reduced, leading to less stress for the grid itself. It is possible to use the proposed measurement system to optimize the power curve profile.



III. THE PROPOSED SYSTEM The Fig. 3 shows the block diagram of the whole  acquisition system. Three acquisitions system are reported, two for trains and one for an electric sub-system.

In the following sub-section, the hardware setup (A) and the implemented software (B) are described in detail.

Figure 2: Power train graphs: Casual case (a) and ideal case (b)     Figure 3. Block Diagram of the whole proposed system.

A. Hardware setup To measure the DC voltage and electric current high input  range sensors are needed. Specifically the chosen voltage sensor is the LEM LV 100-3000/SP3, characterized by an input range of 2 kV. The electric current transducer adopted is the LEM LT 2005-S/SP9, it has 1 kA input range.

The acquisition device used in the tests is composed by NI cDAQ-9191 chassis with the NI-9215 acquisition module (Fig. 4). The NI cDAQ-9191 is a 802.11 Wi-Fi chassis which    b  b  a    can be paired with several NI acquisition modules to implement compact distributed measurement systems; it can send sensor data or stream continuous waveform measurements to a host PC over Ethernet or IEEE 802.11 Wi- Fi. The cDAQ-9191 has been coupled with a NI-9215 module for voltage measurements.

Figure 4. Acquisition and communication system.

By its own nature the system is modular and flexible and is able to achieve high transmission rates. This kind of architecture ensures that precise measurements are made and sent over Wi-Fi to a host, extending PC-based DAQ to measurement applications for which cables are inconvenient or uneconomical. In such context security becomes a key issue: built-in NIST-approved 128-bit AES encryption and advanced network authentication methods ensure that the communication is adequately protected.

Each module combines sensor connectivity, signal conditioning, and A/D converters, with a range from three to 32 channels to accommodate a wide variety of application requirements.

From the software point of view, an application capable of interfacing with this system can be programmed into a variety of different languages, including NI LabVIEW, ANSI C/C++, C#, Visual Basic. NET. Moreover, manufacturer?s libraries allow for both high and low-level programming.

Figure 5. Block diagram of implemented application.

The acquisition device is connected via Wi-Fi to an  android-based Google Nexus 7 tablet computer. It receives the data from the acquisition system and sends them to the server using its UMTS connection (see Fig. 4). Moreover, the tablet is equipped with a GPS receiver: assuming a tablet is present on the train to collect the measurement from the wireless sensors, using its embedded GPS system is possible to measure the coordinate position of the train itself.

B. Implemented software The tablet used as base for the software implementation  runs the version 4.2 of Android operative system. Based on Linux kernel (version 3.4), it includes a set of C-coded libraries which serve as interface between the kernel and the higher software levels, which are coded in Java and make use of a Java virtual machine (in the form of Google?s own Dalvik Virtual Machine, DVM).

Starting from the experience of the authors [9]-[17], and making use of the Android SDK [18] with Eclipse IDE, an application to manage the remote sensors has been developed.

AcquiringApp is the software application developed for Android that gives the possibility to the user to control the data acquisition system: basic operation is described in Fig. 5.

The acquisition device is connected to the Android device using the Wi-Fi ad-hoc connectivity, for a point to point communication. National Instruments releases a set of APIs for the cDAQ-9191, called WebAPI, which allow to wirelessly configure the device and acquire the measurements.

The communication with the acquisition board relies on the http commands GET and POST, made available by the cDAQ- 9191 WebAPI. By means of the GUI the user can: configure the acquisition mode of the cDAQ-9191, manually start and stop an acquisition or program the cDAQ-9191 to do it by itself, manage data flows displaying data on the tablet or send them to a remote server.

GUI of the realized application, in particular the screenshot is of AcquiringApp of the processed samples. A maximum of 4 channels can be set for each acquisition device, and the acquired data takes place in the form of a string composed of a sequence of 32 bit floats representing the measurements relative to the enabled channels. It is possible to set the sampling frequency and the acquisition device can be set to stream the data continuously or programmed for the acquisition and processing of a finite number of samples: in this last case, it is possible to show only the results of processed data (Show Data) or all the points acquired. Finally, with the Store Data option, choice is given whether to save the data in the tablet memory. Default values can be set so that when launched, the application starts with the default settings, allowing for immediate acquisition.

In this way measurements regarding voltage, electric current and power consumption are obtained. To these is to be added the position of the train, obtained using the GPS receiver of the tablet. The collected information is then sent to the server through the UMTS connection of the tablet. The server is then entitled to apply a specific management policy basing on the data coming from the trains and the electrical substation.

Another Android application still in development will interact and interface directly with the central server, making available on the device the indication (i.e. where and when to start braking or accelerating) resulting from the application of a specified energy policy. Moreover it will be possible to have an overview of all the train fleet, the total and individual train consumptions and the status of the fleet.

Even though generally adoptable, the system is intended particularly for subways, where is possible to manage synchronized departure and arrival of trains, without having  special complications related to traffic on the individual lines and from/to stations.

C. Results and simulations The entire system makes possible to access the data from all  the trains by means of a tablet, or by directly accessing to the server: it is possible to display on the tablet the waveform of voltage and electric current, acquired by the sensors and connected to the acquisition system, furthermore the software is able to evaluate some parameters of interest from the acquired samples, like average value, root mean square, maximum and minimum value and offset of the waveform, using the processing abilities of the processors present on the modern portable devices. In the developed application these values are show; it is possible, just modifying the code loaded on the devices, to calculate other useful parameters or anything else required by the specific user?s application (without hardware modifications). In Fig. 7 are shown the data acquired in laboratory connecting the acquisition board with a waveform generator (Hewlett Packard 33120A): the ad-hoc signal, built for this measurements, looks like the typical run of the absorbed current by a train (very similar to the waveform of Fig. 1).

Some measurement have been taken to assess the capability of sending the acquired data to the server: the implemented application can manage the acquisition board in order to put in practice two different modes, finite mode and continuous mode, with sampling frequency variable from 100 Hz to 100 kHz. In finite mode the board acquires a temporal window of the signal, with a certain number of points selectable by the user. In continuous mode the signal is analyzed for an indefinite time interval and it ends only when the user decides to stop the process manually, various solutions have been analyzed to send data to the server. The data transfer operation is the slowest and represents the bottleneck that limits the management of the buffer memory used to implement this kind of acquisition: the memory is used like a circular buffer.

Finite length buffer is filled with acquired data flux; reached the end, writing restarts from the start index, overwriting the previously stored data. So, the speed of the data sent from buffer to server have to be reasonably higher than the loading speed of the buffer; the time employed for the posting restricts, necessarily, the sample frequency.

In order to find the best way to transfer data to the server, sequential and parallel methods have been tested: the   Figure 6. Screenshot of the implemented application: presentation of  results.

Figure 7. Screenshot of current profile acquisition    sequential sending of data consist in a simple send of samples by means of an asynchronous task, that it is sent when the previous task has exhausted its function and it was closed; the sending can also be done by launching multiple threads in parallel, using a FIFO queue; have been made some tests both with ten tasks and twenty tasks in parallel. In the following table are shown the measured time, that are congruent with the data contained in the information that includes also the time of the GPS; the measurements are made on the same signal, a sine wave of amplitude 5V, frequency 20 Hz and without offset.

To perform a continuous acquisition correctly the maximum  sampling frequency coincides with the inverse of the Tsample, it is therefore convenient to use tasks in parallel, being able to arrive at a maximum sampling rate of almost 10Hz.



IV. CONCLUSION In this paper the hardware architecture and the software for a  measurement system, that is able to make the possibility of data fusion for trains in motion, by means of wireless sensors, are presented. Also a solution to send and collect data referenced to a common time scale to a management center are presented that, if well programmed, could arrange intelligently increases and decreases of trains? speed letting trains exchange energy flows that will mitigate electric current peaks. After that, the electric supply of the trains could be considered more reliable because there is more margin between the maximum electric current that the network can supply and the maximum of the peak of electric current reached in the train movement schedule. That system can be optimized especially for the subway, whereas is possible to manage, for example, synchronized departure and arrival of train, without having special complications related to traffic on the individual lines and to stations.

The research work will continue with the tests of the entire system on train board and reducing the transmission delays in the process of sending data to the server, in order to be able to increase the sampling frequency in continuous mode; similarly, it will be developed an algorithm for the acquisition of a window in finite mode when the electric current, and therefore the speed, suddenly change. A possible application  development could be the addition of visual alerts for the driver in software; another interesting possible development is the addition of a section dedicated to monitor the state of charge of the storage systems. With an efficient acquisition system of the voltage, current and state of charge of the batteries it will be possible manage the power flux efficiently and so more convenient from the economic and environmental impact point of view.
