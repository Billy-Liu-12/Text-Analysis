Analysis & Visualization on movie?s   popularity and reviews

Abstract? Information visualization with the movie's trend of audiences and reviews becomes important. Movie makers are not only want to know their movie's popularity based on the number of audiences but also check their movie?s evaluation from people who see the movies. If they hope that the movie is a box office hit, they should identify the correlations between audiences and reviews. Our visualization tools try to find the movie?s moods by using normalized graphs and showing the relationships. Experiments on real dataset from a movie site (naver-movie.com) and Korean Film Council containing the number of customers in each movie. We find some unique relations and discover the word-of-mouth effects from our results.



I. INTRODUCTION With advanced internet and mobile environments,  audiences benefit from convenient and more efficient way of accessing information. Nevertheless, this pool of overloading data makes it more difficult to find what is meaningful to the audiences. Similarly, since there are many movies in the world, it is hard for audiences to decide what a movie is the best for them. They usually refer to the movie-portal web-sites to check other people?s reviews or ratings and web portals become one of the important factors in terms of getting profit for movie producers [2]. Also, the rapid increase of social network, the information diffuses to others (i.e. social friends) very quickly [1, 4, 5]. People tend to believe that more positive ratings on a movie imply that the movie is good one.  However, sometimes, it is true but not always. Some people manipulate the ratings intentionally in order to take users into their targeted movies or to decrease competitive movie?s audiences [3].

In the movie maker?s view, they should be interested in knowing their movie is now getting positive reputations from reviews or ranking in the market because it is strongly related with their profits. Together with them, they may want to know the relations between ranking and reviewer?s feedbacks (ratings). In the audience?s view, they may want to know what a movie is really good or not. They also wish to know the popularity of a movie come from huge advertisement or reviewer?s positive feedbacks.

In our work, to address these aspects, we identify to make a visualization of movie ratings and ranking based on time series. Clear visualization on huge user?s data is important since compact abstraction or a large amount of information helps people decide proper choices. Crawling the online movie reviews data to recognize relationship between users and reviews. Even if we tackle two aspects (movie maker, audience), our main target is movie distributors (i.e movie makers). We explore the movie?s audience patterns and influence the reviews on movie.

The main contributions in this paper are summarized as follows:  ? We propose a visualization approach to find clearly hidden relations between movies and their evaluation.

? Analyzing the patterns with reviews, we find out influence of the word-of-mouth effects.

The rest of paper is organized as follow. In section II, we demonstrate our visualization approach and details the concept of user interface and visualization methods in section

III. In section IV we explain the implementation environments, then analyze the findings. Finally, we conclude the paper and discuss our future work in section V.



II. VISUALZATION APPROACH Let assume one has a movie in the market, and he is the  one of movie makers in the market. He can easily understand the success of the movie by monitoring the number of customers or the gross income from the box offices. However, it is hard to know or compare what a movie is successful or not in the market if he has a bunch of movie information. Also, he may feel difficulties to analyze his marketing strategy gets positive response from the reviewers. To address these challenges, we try to put all information on a screen. The information displayed on the screen is considered to solve the following questions: (i) Can we know the effect of the movies is successful or not? (ii) What is a pattern between profit and marketing cost? (iii) Is there a significant difference between domestic and overseas movies? (iv) Can we compare the several movies at a glance? Each question is implemented with the approaches of visualization as the following ways.

We display the total number of movie customers on the time axes. This approach will give users the clear identification of which movie is popular or not (i.e., the success of the movies).

Together with the plotting, we put a bar chart beside the customers plot. The bar chart will compare pre-attentively which movie has the largest or the least number of customers.

In this approach, we give intuitive comparison to any users addressing the question (i).

We assume that the response from the marketing strategy can be estimated using the number of reviews from online movie review site. The more reviews mean more intensive and positive response to the marketing on a movie. To visualize market response, we propose two kinds of visualizations on the screen. First, we draw the line chart with normalized values from the number of customers and reviews. The difference between two values on each time point (each day in our visualization) has color coding with blue or red. The blue color means that the normalized number of customers is greater than that of the reviews otherwise we give red color to the difference. The reason we differentiate the color is that a movie maker will be happy (blue) if the number of customers     are larger than reviews (could be interpreted as marketing cost and response). On the other hand, if the number of reviews are large but the number of customers are small, he may conclude that the customers does not enjoy his movie even the marketing is vastly launched. To clearly identify the pattern, we put visualization under the plots showing the difference from zero value.

To compare the patterns between movies, we give an option that user can modify the monitoring time period. For example, each user may want to see the pattern for one week or one month since a movie has different customer pattern.

This option allows the users to easily navigate and explore the large dataset. This approach is addressing the question (ii) stated above.

To analyze the difference between any movies (ex., overseas vs. domestic movies), we implement the user option to be able to select any movies from the dataset. This approach makes users easy to compare any movies. This approach can solve the question (iii) and (iv).



III. IMPLEMENTATION & FINDINGS  A. Dataset We have crawled the movie dataset from a famous  internet movie review site (movie.naver.com). We note that any other online movie site can be applied our approach. The dataset contains all user ids, movie ids, and rating scores from Jan. 1, 2006 to Jul. 30, 2012. The dataset consists of 1,160,448 users, 13,129 movies, 3,047,960 ratings. Again, to analyze this size of data is non-trivial.

B. Relation between Users and Reviews For easy explanation, we take 4 movies to show our  findings. First of all, in Fig 1(a), most movies released within only one month and more than half of the total audiences watch the movie within 2 weeks. Movie reviews have similar patterns compared to the audiences. These results are caused by the movie maker's marketing. Before releasing the movie, a movie maker makes an attempt to advertise their movie on TV, radio, internet etc. People who have been exposed to the advertising may watch the movie when the movie is released with high expectation. After watching the movie, if audiences satisfy that movie, they leave a good rating on the movie- review site. Otherwise, they leave a bad rating or even they do not give rating score anymore.

Secondly, there are some patterns with audiences and reviews. At first, people watch the movie and then leave ratings. This phenomenon is repeated several times. It is  shown that many people observe the movie-review site's ratings and decide to whether watch the movie or not. If some movie has good reviews on many audiences, it is more likely to watch a movie than has bad reviews. Last but not least, we find villains who intentionally manipulate the reviews in order to deceive people to watch the movie they want. In Fig. 1(b) the ?PungSan-Dog? shows such a situation. Even though only few people watch the movie, there are a lot of reviews on that movie with good ratings. After observing that reviews, many people watch that movie and they recognize this movie is not fun. These results can be identified by checking the changes of average ratings.



IV. CONCLUSION Until now, we learn the patterns between movie audiences  and reviews. Making graphs is in regard to the audiences and reviews by normalizing results which are meaningful in terms of identifying and comparing the patterns. It is proved that there exists the word-of-mouth effects which an influence the movie's profit significantly. Moreover, we find that there are some correlations between audiences and reviews with recurring way. Our approach could successfully demonstrate the existence phenomenon by interacting people and our system with simple visualization. For our future work, we do research on how to verify manipulated reviews.
