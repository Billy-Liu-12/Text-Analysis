Abstract-In research of molecular biology, it is essential to characterize proteins functionally. One of such characterization method is to predict function from its amino acid sequence. Motifs are representative features of functions in a protein. However, little is known about relations in more than two motifs. In this paper, we will find association rules on motifs using data mining algorithm. Our  result shows about 1,300,000 rules with lower bound of 95% confidence and 0.003% support. The rules have enriched biological meanings.

As a n  example of pattern interpretation, we examine two intracellular CaZt-release channels: ryanodine receptor and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor.

I. INTRODUCTION  To understand biological activities in cell, it is essential to characterize functions of proteins. From particular function of a protein, there could be complex biological processes. One of the methods for characterizing proteins is to predict biological functions from basic building units - amino acids.

As the size of protein sequence database grows, it becomes more powerful to predict functions by sequence comparison. Rather comparing whole protein sequences, we use protein sequence motifs that are representative feature of proteins and their functions. Every protein can be characterized by either a distinct motif or a combination of motifs, understanding motif association is crucial to understanding the nature and extent of biochemical functions [ I ] .  Various motif combinations are interesting because combining with other motifs a motif can give more complicated and specified function to a protein.

Nevertheless, little is known about the relations in more than two motifs. There are several motif finding algorithms and protein motif databases such as PROSITE [2], PRINTS [3], PFAM [4] using those algorithms. In this paper, we use Interpro database [5] that provides integrated and non- redundant protein-to-motif data and find association rules on motifs using data mining algorithm. Biological meaning of the association rules is also present with an example.

METHODOLOGY  We used Interpro database that provides integrated and non-redundant view of protein-to-motif data (see Table I) for extracting the associations among protein motifs using IBM Intelligent Miner for Data [ 6 ] .  The protein-to motif data was built from InterPro database with IDS to DB2. (see Table E )  1) An example of associalion rules amongprotein motif: Here is an association rule simplified form of the real association rules of motif data; (ml AND m2 AND '.. mk) + mk+l. Symbol m, means a protein motif, and the arrow shows a subordinate relation in math. Therefore, the symbolized association rule, (ml AND m2 AND ... mk) + mk+l, has meaning; "if one or more motif(s) ml, m2, . ', mk are in a protein, then motif mk+lwould exist in protein."  2) Parameters in associalion rules: Like other statistical results, several values are shown with association rules for interpretation of the meaning. The values are support ( I ) , confidence (2), expected confidence (3), p-value (4) and lift (S), and their definitions are shown below.

Mining association rules  In Intelligent Miner for Data, it is possible to set up values for mining association rules and clustering the results into groups. We had expected there could have been some kind of special association rules beyond our knowledge: rules that can't be explained by our established knowledge from experiment or else. So, we applied the mining tool several times with different support value from I %  to 0.003%.

Afier that, we extracted associations among protein motifs and sorted them according to groups. The number of protein entries and motif entries are 643,332 and 6,707. The number of motifs per protein is 20 in maximum and 1.72 on average. The length of resulting association rules are vary.

Fig. I shows log-scale number of the resulting association rules.

B. Selected association rule set  We extracted associations among protein sequence motifs in Interpro as explained previous part. From them, we selected a set of association rules with minimum 95% confidence and 0.003% support value. In the selected set,  16 I  111. DISCUSSION  We selected a set of association rules with minimum 95% confidence and 0.003% support value among varies rule sets. In this set, almost 1,300,000 rules are shown. Here is simple and well-understood example of protein sequence motif association. Atter seeing that, we are going to talk about contribution of our work for analysis of protein functions. For better understanding, it is usetid to draw the rules to directed graphs. And we also attached InterPro annotations for the same purpose.

N = N ~  log-sale numben of association d e s     There are several Ca2+ channels in a cell for biologically diverse functions. Ryanodine and inositol 1,4,5- trisphosphate (IP,) receptors are intracellular &*?-release channels. Their major function is transferring Ca? ions through cellular membrane like other Ca2? channels.

However, they are integral channel proteins with trans- membrane helices and form homo-tetramer for their functions unlike other Ca2+ channels. The functional schemes of ryanodine and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP,) receptors look same. Both types of channels are structurally similar and regulated by positive feedback, in which the released Ca2?can bind back to the channels to increase the Ca*?-release, which tend to make the release occur in a sudden, all-or-none fashion. In many cells, including muscle cells, both type of Ca2+-release channels are present [7].

At the same time, the detailed mechanisms of them are quit different. (see Table IV) They become activated upon binding of their respective ligands, Ca*+ and IP,, opening integral Ca2+ channels. Ryanodine receptor activation is a key component of muscular contraction. Their activation allows release of Ca? from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR).

And ryanodine receptors are involved in communication between transverse-tubules and the sarcoplamic reticulum of cardiac and skeletal muscle [SI. In contrast, inositol 1,4,5- trisphosphate (IP,) receptors exist in most kind of cells that have endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mediate diverse cellular responses according to their cellular context.

Consequently, mutations in each channel cause different abnormalities in organism.

In Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL databases, there are 25 ryanodine receptor proteins. 24 of them have 8 InterPro motifs: IPR002048, IPR005821, IPR003877, IPR001682, IPR000699, IPR003608, IPR0012 15 and IPR003032. And, one of them - ryanodine receptor of sea urchin- has 7 Interpro motifs: all of the mentioned motifs without IPR001215. A association rule of those 8 motifs are shown in fig. 2 with 0.0034% of support, 100.00% of confidence, 100.00% of p-value and 26804.67 of lift.

Motif lPR002048 represents 305 1 Ca2+-binding EF- hand and IPROO5821 is common feature in 1160 ion transport proteins.

, IPR003032 is specific feature of ryanodine receptors that sorts out 24 ryanodine receptors from other proteins. In table ID, you could see several association rules that have IPR003032 as ?tail? of ?head -tail? rules. With these rules, we discover representative motifs for ryanodine receptor proteins and their function.

Because there are eight motifs for ryanodine receptors and two of them-IPR001215 and IPR003032- are the implying motifs for ryanodine receptors, we make the shortest rules for ryanodine receptors that have IPR003032 as ?tail?. The shortest rules have combinations of three motifs as ?head? elements and there can be non-redundant 20 (=&,) combinations with the remaining six motifs. We compare real resulting rules of 100.00% confidence with these candidates to find out active or the most important sites that make ryanodine receptors to function as ryanodine receptors (see Table V, VI).

As we mentioned, ryanodine and inositol 1,4,5- trisphosphate receptors are similar in function and structure.

Table VI shows several motifs that are shared in both receptors and are individually possessed by each receptor.

As you see, if there are two or three motifs that exist not in IP, receptors but in ryanodine receptors as ?head?, they show rules for ryanodine receptor. And, almost every case has a motif that exists not in IP1 receptors but in ryanodine receptors as ?head?, they also show rules for ryanodine receptors with confidence 100.00%. However, #16 rule is exception. It has IPR002048, a motif exists not in IP, receptors but in ryanodine receptors, but it isn?t shown for ryanodine receptors with 100.00% confidence.

Comparing with other rules, which has only IPR002048 as a motif exists not in IP, receptors but in ryanodine receptors, in table V(#S, #6, #13, and #14) with # 16 rule, there are different clustcrs according to different motif combinations. A rule (#S) of IPR002048 with IPR005821 and IPR000699 as ?head? exists with 100.00% confidence. However, a similar rule, which has IPR001682 instead of IPR000699, does not exist with confidence 100.00%. In fact, #I6 rule is also supported by seven variou  \\ //  / \  Fig. 2.

v. CONCLUSION Up to now, we have looked at an example of motif  associations gained from data mining tool. Our study of protein sequence motifs with IBM Intelligent Miner for Data shows about 1,300,000 rules with lower bound of 95% confidence and 0.003% support. The rules have biologically enriched meanings.

We could separate ryanodine receptors and IP, receptors only with three sequence motifs. And we insure the hypothesis: motifs are key features of protein function and "words" for biologically meaningful "phrases". We also  I  protein sequences.

The number of proteins that has more than one motif  isn't many enough to find out novel associations, because 68.3% of protein entries aren't have any sequence motif or have only one. However, the number of motifs is increasing day by day. In this way, as .protein motif databases grows, the number of association rules by our method will increase to provide better understanding for protein functions.
