The Application of Fuzzy Data Mining in Coal-Fired  Boiler Combustion System

Abstract?Coal-fired boiler combustion system is a complex multi-input and multi-output plant with strong nonlinear and large time-delay. Currently the research of optimizing the combustion process is monitor oriented instead of decision oriented. So it lacks the interaction and decision making with the user. To improve the performance of combustion process, the key point is to decide the optimization values for the main controllable parameters. This paper proposed a fuzzy data mining algorithm to decide the optimization values from the history data sets. In order to soften the partition boundary of the domain, the fuzzy sets theory was introduced into the association mining process. This method can translate Quantitative Association Rules Problem (QARP) into Boolean Association Rules Problem (BARP). Finally some results of instance analysis based on the practical parameters of 300MW power plant unit are given to prove that the fuzzy mining method has good accuracy and interpretability. The effective results are achieved by guiding actual operating based on the optimizing values gotten from the fuzzy data mining process.



I. INTRODUCTION The research on the performance monitoring and  optimizing running in power plant is very active in recent years.

Generally the unit states was judged and modified based on the analysis and measurement the parameters in power plant system off-line. By considering the safety and economy, the controllable factors that affect the thermal efficiency were analyzed to optimize the running process. In this course, the crucial problem is to decide the optimal values of the mostly controllable parameters [1]. The quantitative values of these parameters can provide the decision-making for optimizing the system. Coal-fired boiler is a typical complex multi-input and multi-output plant with strong nonlinear and having no self- balance ability. Combustion process can be affected directly by parameter changes such as the quantity of air feeding, induced air, load, coal feeding, etc. So the problems of deciding optimization values have not been solved till now.

With the development of database and information technology, electric industry accumulated a mass of data. Many important information and knowledge which can guide the decision-making are hidden in the mass data. Data mining or knowledge discovery from databases has been recognized by many researchers as a key research topic in database systems and machine learning and by many industrial companies as an important area with an opportunity of major revenues. The association rule mining is an important task of data mining.

Given a transaction database, it is desirable to discover the important association among items such that the presence of some item in a transaction will imply that of other items in the same transaction. Data mining provided a novel method for deciding the optimization values.



II. COMBUSTION OPTIMIZING CONTROL BASED ON FUZZY ASSOCIATION MINING  Main influential parameters of boiler combustion process are oxygen content in flue gas, furnace pressure, main steam pressure and main steam flow. Oxygen content in flue gas embodies boiler?s thermal efficiency. And main steam flow (is also called load) is random variable that is unpredictable while combustion process must adapt to it. Regulating method is air flow and the quantity of coal-feed. So the combustion optimizing process in power plant unit is a synthesized question [2]. The key is to decide the optimization values for those parameters. The optimizing target in combustion process is to get the point where the thermal efficiency is highest. The problems of deciding optimization values have not been solved till now due to the complex of combustion process.

This paper proposed a fuzzy data mining algorithm to decide the optimization values base on the archived data in electric industry. Association mining method is used to find the relationship among data sets in mass history data. Agrawal and his co-workers proposed Apriori algorithms base on the concept of large itemsets to find association rules from transaction [3,4]. They decomposed the mining process into two phases. In the first phase, candidate itemsets are generated and counted by scanning the transactions. If the number of an itemset appearing in the transactions is larger than a predefined threshold value (called minimum support), the itemset is thought of as a large itemset. Itemsets with only one item are first processed. The large itemsets with one item are then combined to form candidate itemsets of two items. This process is repeated until all large itemsets are found. In the second phase, the desired association rules are induced from the large itemsets found in the first phase and their confidence values are calculated also. The rules with calculated confidence values larger than a predefined threshold (called minimum confidence) are output as desired association rules [5]. After that, many researchers applied themselves to the improvement of this algorithm. The speed and validity of the algorithm have been improved greatly and many other algorithms were put    forward. These algorithms are very effective in mining Boolean Association Rules Problem.

Quantitative association rules were defined over quantitative and categorical attributes. The value of categorical attributes was mapped to a set of contiguous integers. While the domain of quantitative attributes was discretized into intervals by fine-partitioning the values of the attributes and combing the adjacent partitions as necessary, the intervals were then mapped to contiguous integers. As a result, each attribute had a form of <attribute, value> where value was the mapped integer of an interval for quantitative attributes or a single value for categorical attributes [6]. Then the algorithm for finding Boolean association rules can be used on the transformed database to discover quantitative association rules.

Because distinct intervals will exclude those potential elements which are neighbouring the boundary, the data which are close the boundary and contribute to both intervals will have to partial to one interval. To solve this problem, the fuzzy sets theory was introduced into the association mining process to soften the partition boundary of the domain and generalize and abstract the data. The fuzzy concept is better than the partition method because fuzzy sets provide a smooth transition between member and non-member of a set [7]. The fuzzy association rules is in the form of ?If X is A and Y is B then Z is C? where X, Y and Z were sets of attributes,  A, B and C were fuzzy sets which described X, Y and Z respectively. The definition of fuzzy concepts is based on fuzzy set theory, which is especially useful when the discovered rules are presented to human experts for examination and is easy to be understood by users.

The process of mining fuzzy association rules can be divided into two steps:  (1) Generate large fuzzy patterns by scanning the database.

(2) Get fuzzy association rules: Having gotten large fuzzy patterns, the desired fuzzy association rules with the minimum confidence are generated.



III. FUZZY ASSOCIATION MINING ALGORITHM In this paper the fuzzy sets theory was introduced into the  association mining from quantitative data. The proposed fuzzy mining algorithm first transforms each quantitative value into a fuzzy set with linguistic terms using membership functions.

The algorithm then calculates the scalar cardinality of each linguistic term on all the transaction data using the temporary set fC . The linguistic term with the maximum cardinality was used in later mining processes only, thus keeping the number of items the same as that of the original attributes. The mining process based on fuzzy counts is then performed to find fuzzy association rules. The detailed mining algorithm is described as follows.

The fuzzy association mining algorithm:  Input: A body of n transaction data, each with m attribute values, a set of membership functions, a predefined minimum support value and a predefined confidence value. The p-th attribute in the j-th (j=1, 2, ?n) transaction can be described by k membership functions ( )( 1,2,..., )j pp sR s k? = ,  ( 1, 2,..., )psR s k=  is fuzzy set.

Output: A set of fuzzy association rules.

Step 1: Transform the quantitative value ( 1,2,..., )jpt p m=  of  each transaction ( 1,2,..., )jT j n=  in D into a fuzzy set j pf .

j pt  is described by fuzzy sets as:  1 2  1 2  ( ) ( ) ( ) ...

j p j p j p p p p kj  p p p p k  R R R f  R R R ? ? ?  = + + + . (1)  where ( 1,2,..., )spR s k=  is p-th fuzzy region of attribute ( 1,2,..., )jT j n= , and jT  is j-th transaction in D.

Step 2: Build a temporary set 1C  including all the pairs ( spR , ( )  j p p sR? ) of each data, where p=1, 2, ?m, s=1, 2, ?k.

For each region spR  stored in 1C  calculate it scalar cardinality for all transactions:  ,  ( ) n  j j p p s p s  j weight R?  =  = ? . (2)  Step 3: Find max ,1max( ) k  j p p ss  weight weight =  = , for p=1 to m, where  k is the number of fuzzy regions for transaction ( 1,2,..., )jT j n= .

max pweight  will be used to represent this  attribute in later mining processing.

Step 4: Check whether the maxpweight  of each  max ( 1,2,..., )pR p m=  is larger than or equal to the predefined  minimum support. If max ( 1,2,..., )pR p m=  is equal to or greater than the minimum support, put it into the set of large 1- itemsets ( 1L ). That is,  max max 1 { | ,1 }p pL R weight minsupport p m= ? ? ? . (3)  Step 5: Set r=1, where r is used to represent the number of items kept in the current large itemsets.

Step 6: Generate the candidate set 1rC +  from rL . Restated, the algorithm joins rL  and rL  under the condition that 1r ?  items in the two itemsets are the same and the other one is different.

The itemsets which have all their sub-r-itemsets in rL  are put into 1rC + .

Step 7: Do the following substeps for each newly formed (r+1)-itemset 1 2 1( , ,..., )rt t t t += in 1rC + : (a) For each transaction jT , calculate its fuzzy value on ( 1,2,..., 1)t r? ? = +  as:  1 1 2 2 1 1  max max max( ) ( ) ... ( ) r r  j j j j t p p p p p pR R R?? ? ? ? + += ? ? ? . (4)  where j=1 to n. If the minimum operator is used for the intersection, then    maxmin ( )  r j j t p pR? ? ??? ?  +  = . (5)  ?  + ?  = ?. (1) (1)  (b) Calculate  n j  t t j  weight ? ?  ? =  = ?  using 1rC + .

(c) If tweight ?  is larger than or equal to the predefined  minimum support, put 1 2 1( , ,..., )rt t t t +=  into 1rL + .

Step 8: If 1rL +  is null, then do the next step; otherwise, set r=r+1 and repeat Steps 6 to 8.

Step 9: Construct the association rules for all large q-itemset t with items 1 2( , ,..., )qt t t , 2q ? using the following substeps: (a) Form all possible association rules as follows:  1 1 1... ... , 1, 2,...,k k q kt t t t t k q? +? ? ? ? ? ? = . (6)  ?  + ?  = ?. (1) (1)  (b) Calculate the confidence values of all association rules using:  1 1 1   ( ... ... ) k k q  n j j j j t t t t  j n  j t  j ?  ? ? ? ?  ?  ? + =  =  ? ? ? ? ??  ? . (7)  ?  + ?  = ?. (1) (1)  Step 10: Output the rules with confidence value larger than or equal to the predefined minimum confidence.

After Step 10, the rules constructed are output and can act as the meta-knowledge for the given transaction. It is expressed based on reasoning and is easy to be understood.



IV. THE APPLICATION OF FUZZY DATA MINING IN POWER PLANT COMBUSTION PROCESS  Based on the history data of a 300MW power plant unit whose type is N300-16.7/537/537-3, the typical parameters which are related to combustion process are analyzed. Those parameters include load, excessive air coefficient ? , the carbon content in fly ash, flue gas temperature and thermal efficiency, etc. Take the data set which includes 10 transactions as an example to explain the application of fuzzy data mining algorithm. The data set is gotten by sampling in the database at random, and it is shown in Table 1. Each case consists of five course parameters: Load (denoted Ld), Excessive air coefficient ?  (denoted Eac), Unburned carbon content in fly ash (denoted Uca), Flue gas temperature (denoted Fgt) and thermal efficiency (denoted Effi). Assume in this process, minsupport is set at 3.0 and minimum confident is set at 0.75.

Each course is thought as an attribute in the mining process and each attribute has three fuzzy regions: Low, Middle and High. Thus three fuzzy membership values are produced for each course according to the predefined membership functions.

The membership function of load is shown in Figure 1. The membership functions of other parameters are similar to that of load.

Figure 1. The membership function of load.

TABLE I. THE SET OF COMBUSTION PARAMETERS IN TYPICAL STATES  The transaction data in Table 1 are first transformed into fuzzy sets, with the results shown in Table 2.

TABLE II. THE FUZZY SETS TRANSFORMED FROM THE COMBUSTION DATA IN TABLE 1  The  large 1-itemsets ( 1L ) is built as shown in Table 3.

TABLE III. L1-LARGE 1-ITEMSETS  Item sets Weight Ld       H 4.6 Ead     M 3.9 Uca     M 3.8 Fgt      H 3.8 Effi     H 4.4    The candidate 2-itemsets 2C  is built base on 1L  as shown in Table 4.

TABLE IV. C2-CANDIDATE 2-ITEMSETS  Item sets Weight Ld   H, Eac   M 3.7 Ld   H, Uca   M 2.5 Ld   H, Fgt    H 2.2 Ld   H, Effi   H 3.8 Eac  M, Uca  M 2.4 Eac  M, Fgt   H 2.2 Eac  M, Effi  H 3.1 Uca   M, Fgt  H 1.7 Uca   M, Effi  H 2.1 Fgt   H, Effi   H 1.4  The large 2-itemsets 2L  is built based on 2C  according to minsupport=3.

TABLE V. L2-LARGE 2-ITEMSETS  Item sets Weight Ld   H, Eac   M 3.7 Ld   H, Effi   H 3.8 Eac  M, Effi  H 3.1  The candidate 3-itemsets 3C  is built based on 2C according to minsupport=3.

TABLE VI. C3-CANDIDATE 3-ITEMSETS  Item sets Weight Ld   H, Eac   M, Effi  H       3.0  The support of sup( Ld   H, Eac   M, Effi   H)=3.0 is larger or equal to minsupport, so 3L  is built. Because the thermal efficiency is determined by the other running parameters of the combustion process, we would like to get the influencing results of those parameters to the thermal efficiency. So the fuzzy association rule  H, M HLd Eac Effi?  is obtained according to Step 9. The confidence of this rule is as follows:  confidence( H, M H)= sup( H, M, H) 3.0 81.1%  sup( H, M) 3.7  Ld Eac Effi Ld Eac Effi  Ld Eac  ?  = = (8)  The confidence of this rule is larger than minconfidence (75%). Thus it is output as meta-knowledge concerning the given transactions. From the results of the fuzzy mining we can conclude that the combustion thermal efficiency reaches maximum value (no less than 92%) when the unit is almost running at full load (296MW~300MW) and excessive air coefficient ?  is set at 1.34~1.43. The middle value or the weighted average of intervals can be adopted to decide the  optimization point. The optimization value of excessive air coefficient ?  is 1.42 when the load is 300MW (100%) by using the weighted average method. According to the method mentioned above, by utilizing the fuzzy association mining to mine the important parameters in power plant history records when the typical load of 100%, 90% and 75%, etc, a set of optimization values is obtained. The model related to the optimal states can obtained by regression analysis of those optimization values. The model related to the optimal states can obtained by regression analysis of those optimization values. Take the excessive air coefficient as an example. The optimization value attained by data mining and the design value is shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2. The comparative curves of optimization value and design value of the excessive air coefficient  From Figure 2, we can see that the optimization curve achieved by data mining is in accord with the actuality. The unit efficiency is affected greatly by the excessive air coefficient. The unit efficiency is high in lower excessive air coefficient under the condition of stabilized combustion and security. The heat loss 2q  will increase when the excessive air coefficient is increased, while the content of CO and unburned carbon content in fly ash increases when the excessive air coefficient is decreased. So an optimization value exists to a specified load. The unburned loss increases and the heat loss decreases when the excessive air coefficient is decreased in 300MW. But when the excessive air coefficient is larger the 1.42, the increase of the unburned loss is far less than the decrease of the heat loss as the excessive air coefficient is decreased. So the optimization value is set at 1.42 when 300MW. In lower load range the excessive air coefficient is larger by considering the completely combustion and security.



V. CONCLUSION This paper proposed a fuzzy data mining algorithm to  decide the optimization values in power plant combustion process. The fuzzy data mining method has the following virtues: (1) The rules of deciding the target values are straightforward and easy to guide operation. (2) Base on the actual data in practice, the rules can reflect the actual status. (3) The target value can be dynamically regulated to reflect the variety of the unit status. (4) The target value is presented in an interval, so the operator can have more choices in the interval to optimizing the running course according the actual state of the unit.

In order to soften the partition boundary of the domain and generalize and abstract the data, the fuzzy sets theory was introduced into the association mining process. The transaction data with quantitative values was analyzed and processed to discover fuzzy association rules among them.

Each item uses only the linguistic term with the maximum cardinality in the mining processes, thus the number of fuzzy regions is the same as that of the original items. The algorithm therefore focuses on the most important linguistic terms [8].
