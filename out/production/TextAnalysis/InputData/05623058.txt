A Data Mining Method on the Study of Medical Information

Abstract?For a long time, the cause of diabetes has been an unsolved problem. And with the deepening of diabetes research, much information has been collected. There may contain lots of interesting information within the collected medical information. But, the traditional medical methods can only study the human organ from the microscopic view, and lack of the capability of process large medical data set. So, in this paper, an data mining method is introduced to provide a new way to find the diabetes etiology.

I.  INTRODUCTION Next to cardiovascular disease and tumor, diabetes has  been as the third major disease all over the world. But, for a long time, the etiology of diabetes has still been unidentified, which makes the treatment and prevention of diabetes much difficult. The traditional research methods on the diabetes etiology mainly focus on the microscopic medical methods, which studies human body only. Over a hundred years of Modern medical research makes it clear that pancreas is the organ that causes diabetes. Furthermore, islet cells, ? cells and insulin have been found. And now, hundreds of diabetes pathogenic genes have been found by the gene method.

However, until now, we just know the pathological change of pancreas, islet and the ? cells causes the diabetes [1, 2, 3], but, how? How can these pathological changes cause the diabetes? Further, what causes the changes? Dose this relates to human?s living habit or dose this relates to inheritance?

Those are still questions, which makes the diabetes an incurable disease. And, the key to find the answers of above questions is to make the relations among those factors clear.

Unfortunately, the traditional medical methods of diabetes research can only process small amounts of tissue samples, and lack the capacity to find relations from large amount of  medical information gained from the patients. Thus, the key to the answer slipped through the fingers.

Data mining is a process of extracting valid, previously unknown and actionable information from large data set. We can find the relations which are hided in the large medical data set using the data mining technology. But, the researches on the using of data mining method into the medical studies are not too much [4, 5].

According to the limitation of traditional medical methods, a data mining method is put forward in this paper, and we hope it can pick up the lost key to open the door of finding the diabetes etiology. For finding the relation of the diabetes factors, an attribute important degree measure methods is introduced first, and then a correlation algorithm is put forward, finally, a method is proposed to combine them to find the factors and their relation that causes the diabetes.



II. THE IMPORTANT DEGREE OF ATTRIBUTES  A. rough set theories[6] Information Systems: A Information Systems can be  define as L=(U, Q,V ,f) in which U={x1,?,xn}is the domains of discourse, Q?A ? D is attribute set, in which A is condition attributes set, D is decision attributes set, V is attributes value set, f is the map of U?Q?V.

Indiscernibility relation: For x, y U, P? ? Q, if q P F? ? q( X) = Fy ( y), then for the attributes set P, x and y is  indiscernible, if x and y are not discernible. The Indiscernibility relation of P notes for ind(P).

upper approximation and lower approximation: Set P?Q, [ x ]P = { y U | x ind ( P) y}, Y ? ?U, then the lower approximation of Y is PY={ x U | [ x ]? p ?Y}, and the upper approximation is PY  = {x U | [ x ]? p ?Y ??}.

approximation accuracy: Set P?Q, L is a division of U determined by decision attribute D{Y1 , Y2 , ?, Yk}, Y U, ?  V9-183   C978-1-4244-7237-6/$26.00     2010 IEEE    then the approximation accuracy of Y according to P is ap ( Y ) =card ( P Y) / card ( PY ) , in which card(Y) is the element number of Y. The approximation accuracy of L according to attribute set P is as (1), and the rough approximation accuracy of L according to attribute set P is as (2).

( ) ( ) / ( )  k  p i i  r L card PY card U =  =?   (1)   1 1 ( ) ( ) / ( )  k k  p i i i i  a L card PY card PY = =  =? ?   (2)  B. The important degrees of attributes The important degree of attribute is computed by the two  approximation accuracy (1)(2)of rough set. Set decision attribute set is D, and condition attributes set is F = {f1 , f2 , ?, f m }. The division L determined by D is {L1 , L2 , ?, Lk }. For each condition attribute fi, compute K+2 parameter: af i ( Y j ) , j = 1 , 2 , ?, k, and afi ( L) and rf i (L), in which af i ( L) and rf i (L) is the mean value and variance of the K+2 parameter[7].

The important degree of attribute fi is Wfi = (1 j k? ? ?  afi (Yj) + afi (L) +rfi(L) ) / ( k + 2)), and We should take the advice of expert into account. Set the important degree of attribute fi given by expert be Wpi.

Then the final important degree of attribute fi is Wi = Wfi + Wpi.



III. FIND THE RELATION FROM MEDICAL DATA SET The purpose of us is to find the factors that cause  diabetes and their relations with diabetes. First, we have to gain sufficient diabetes information, which include the patients? basic condition (including the weight, age, sex etc.), medical history, their relatives? medical history, habits and customs and examination results (including the hemogram, CT, and B ultrasonic result etc.). For the integrity and consistency of the information, a mature information gathering system should be built among several hospital, including well designed unified diagram, table data expression and storage format.

We use the correlation algorithm of the data mining to find the potential relation from the medical information. The apriori algorithm [8, 9, 10] is one of the most famous correlation algorithms, which can find the frequent itemsets from large scale data set. And, there are many improved algorithm based on it. Most of them focus on the improving of the mining efficiency. But, for the medical research, mining efficiency is not the most important factor, and we want to find more useful association rules and abandon more useless association rules. So, a new association algorithm which is suitable for finding diabetes etiology is introduced in this section.

The data set we got is all the diabetes patients information, and is stored as a table, which has the form of (Name, Sex, Height, Medical History, ? , Diabetes), and if the attribute value of diabetes is 1 means the patient gets the diabetes. For the diabetes research, we just analyze the  records whose diabetes value is 1.So, when we use the apriori algorithm on such a data set (all records diabetes value is 1), the attribute diabetes seems to be nonsense, and the frequent itemsets we find seem to be independent of attribute diabetes, which conflicts with our purpose. So, the important degree of attribute diabetes which is defined in the former section is used to solve the problem. The apriori algorithm is used to analyze the data set without attribute diabetes to find all the frequent itemsets, and then, they are matched with the important attributes we find, and those matched frequent itemsets are selected. Then the attribute diabetes is added into all the frequent itemsets to find the association rule. Among all the rules, the rules with the pattern ?*=>*, diabetes, *? (which contain the diabetes etiology information) are chosen, and those with no attribute ?diabetes? appears on the right side of the ?=>? are ignored (because we want to find what causes diabetes, but not diabetes causes what). The rules we find contain the direct cause of diabetes, e.g. b=1 => diabetes=1 means b=1 may cause diabetes. Furthermore, we want to find what causes b=1, and we can not use the frequent itemsets we find by upper apriori algorithm, because the data set we used is focus on the diabetes information (all the attribute value of diabetes is 1). So, we have to extract the records that the attribute value of b is 1 from the original data set. And then, we find the association rule with the pattern of * => *, b=1, * using the method we find the rule *=>*, diabetes, *, and this time the attribute diabetes is replaced by attribute b. After this, we can find an association chain such as c=1 => b=1 => diabetes=1, which means b=1 is the direct cause of diabetes, and c=1 is the direct cause of b=1 and may be the indirect cause of diabetes=1. The algorithm is shown in algorithm 1.We can set an iteration time N, which makes the iteration run N times to find N length association chains.

DiaApriori(D, FA, Fa, V, N) Input: D The medical dataset FA The attribute set of D  Fa The attribute for which we want to find the association, and the value of the first call is diabetes V The value of Fa N iteration time Begin N=N-1;  If N>=0 Begin  Select the subset from D, in which the value of attribute Fa for all the records is V.

Remove attribute Fa from the selected subset, and the remained dataset is Da.

Compute the important degree of attributes using  equation 3. Set the threshold value be t, and select the attributes whose important degree is higher than t. Set the select attribute set be IA={Fi1, Fi2, ?, Fim}.

Select all Frequent Itemsets FI from Da , using the apriori algorithm.

For each itemset in FI Begin If 80% attributes is in IA, put the itemset into attribute  set FIS, and put attribute Fa into the itemset.

V9-184     End For Compute association rules from FIS using apriori  algorithm, and select the rule with the pattern of * => *, a=V, * into rule set RS.

For each rule AR in RS (AR may has the pattern *, Fb=Vb, *=> *, a=V, *) Begin For each Fb=Vb in AR  Begin DiaApriori(D, FA, Fb, Vb, N-1).

End for End for End if  End DiaApriori Algorithm 1: The improved apriori algorithm for diabetes  data If we just want to find the direct association, set N=1 at  the first call of DiaApriori.



IV. EXPRIMENT An information gathering system was established for the  experiment, and the medical data were got from 3 first-level hospital of Handan, China. We used the data structure of [11], which includes 40 attributes. A data set of 57291 records was got with the time span form april, 2007 to april 2009. And among all the data, 13748 records are from diabetes patients, and the value of DIABETES is 1 for them. Among the 13748 record, 12956 records are valid for algorithm 1.The data structure is shown in table 1.

We used the data structure of [], which includes 40 attributes. A data set of 57291 records was got with the time span form april, 2007 to april 2009. And among all the data, 13748 records are from diabetes patients, and the value of DIABETES is 1 for them. Among the 13748 record, 12956 records are valid for algorithm 1. We call DiaAprior with DIABETES=1, N=2. A total 174 direct association rules, and 563 two level indirect association rules are found. It can be seen that the rule number is much smaller than traditional apriori algorithm, because we just choose the rule with the pattern *=>diabetes=1. And some of the meaningful results are shown below.

Age=3 => diabetes=1; DME=3 => diabetes=1; AGE=3, dme=3 => diabetes=1; DIETD=2 => diabetes=1; JOB=1 =>diabetes=1; EDU=2, job=1 => diabetes=1; GLU=3 => diabetes=1; DIETA=5 => diabetes=1; TC=3, DRINK=0 => diabetes=1; WEIGHT=0 =>diabetes=1; AGE=3, DME=6=>diabetes=1; SLPA=3 => diabetes=1; DIETC=5 => diabetes=1; BYC=0 =>dizbetes=1; BYC=0, DRINK=3, DIETD=2 =>diabetes=1; EXER=0 => diabetes=1; DRINK =3=>DIETC=5 => diabetes=1; JOBA=1 => JOB=1 => diabetes=1; JOB=1=> BYC=0=>diabetes=1; DIETD=2 => WEIGHT=0 => diabetes=1; PSYSTR=3 => SLPA=3 =>diabetes=1.

JOBA=1 => DIETC=5 => diabetes=1; JOBA=0 => DIETA=5 => diabetes=1;  V9-185     From the result we can see that some of the rules we find are similar to the known cause of diabetes, which means the method can get meaningful knowledge, such as Age=3 => diabetes=1(Patients age are above 45 may cause diabetes), DME=3 => diabetes=1 ( Above 30% immediate families have diabetes) and DIETD=2 => diabetes=1( The carbohydrate intake is more than normal level). The method can get some unknown association rule, such as PSYSTR=3 => SLPA=3 =>diabetes=1 which means high psychological pressure may cause too little sleep and may indirectly cause diabetes, .TC=3, DRINK=0 => diabetes=1 which means Cholesterol is higher than normal level and no drink may be one of the diabetes symptom, JOBA=1 => DIETC=5 => diabetes=1 which means high strength brainwork may cause intake too mach fat which may cause diabetes and JOBA=0 => DIETA=5 => diabetes=1 which means physical work may cause gluttony which may cause diabetes.

From the result we can see that the cause of diabetes is most likely be living habit including food habit and job condition, and seems to have nothing to do with height, heart disease, Nephropathy history, Liver disease and sex.

Limited by the conditions, the patient data set is just got form 3 hospitals, and there are only 40 attribute in it, so although some interesting rules were found, the origin that causes diabetes is still not clear, and the next stage of our work is to expand the data set, including add some more specialized attributes, and improve the record number.



V. CONCLUSION A data mining method is introduced in this paper to solve  the problem that traditional medical method can not find the complicated relations of the factors that cause diabetes from large scale patients? data. Using the algorithm that improved from apriori, direct and indirect association can be found from the patients? data set. The method not only can find the direct factors related to diabetes, but also can find the indirect factors that cause diabetes, which gives a new way to the research of diabetes.
