Phoenix Mars Scout Landing Risk Assessment Douglas S. Adams

Abstract The Phoenix Mars Scout lander touchdown event is described along with critical variables that determine the risk to its success. Hazards due to terrain slopes and surface rocks are considered in terms of both basic touchdown survival and science team requirements. Dynamic analyses of the landing are described as well as geometric static analyses of potential rock interferences with the solar array deployments. These data are summarized and the total risk to the lander is quantified for use in landing site certification.
