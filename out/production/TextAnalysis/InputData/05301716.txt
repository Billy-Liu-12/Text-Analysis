The quantitative analysis on

Abstract? The distance and retail store attraction have effect on  consumer shopping action. Recently most relative quantitative  modeling study on retail location did not simultaneously consider  those factors including traffic network, traffic grade, store  attraction and competition based on GIS. This paper aims at  these shortages and attempt to integrate above factors and make  quantitative analysis about large scale shops based on  accessibility method, breaking point laws and GIS technique.

The result indicates that accessibility of large scale  supermarket in Shanghai central city is good, the west of city is  better than east. Shops? market region areas in near out ring are  greater. Trade areas between inner loop and middle loop are  smaller. Market size near out loop and inside inner loop is  greater. Market scale of between inner loop and middle loop is  smaller. This study can make urban planner know about retail  network layout. Managers can quickly understand the shop  trade areas and provide the consult for choosing shops location.

I.          INTRODUCTION  Managing trade areas is an old marketing problem and a major concern for retail and service firms, especially with the development of retail and service networks. According to Ghosh and McLafferty (1987) [1], the trade area is ??the geographic area from which the store draws most of its  customers and within market penetration is highest??. In the 1980s Chinese retail location studies emphasized particularly on applying the Central Place Theory to research on the center business district market area [2]. Since 1990, investigate measures tend to became diversified which include model analysis and GIS techniques such as Voronoi diagram and behavior means to delimit retail trade areas [3-6]. In other countries, many new methods were use to delineate store trade areas including empirical methods such as the analog method, the statistical methods such as the regression method and clustering method, and theoretical methods such as the gravity models and some new methods such as higher-Order and Multiplicatively Weighted Voronoi Diagrams and morphological analysis[7-8]. Other countries? urban geography researchers do forepart investigation toward spatial accessibility. In 1959 Hansen firstly brought forward the concept of accessibility which defined the number of interactive opportunity among the traffic network node.

Relative researchers carried out the argument and survey toward the different type community service facilities widely and deeply [9-14]. Recently Chinese relative researches mainly lay emphasis on the accessibility of community service facilities based on GIS spatial analysis[15-16].

According to above-mentioned study, so far most of spatial analysis method about retail facilities accessibility and trade areas delineating adopt homogeneous Euclidean distance and buffer methods which neglect the effect of road network and     grade. Some studies consider the scale factors or the road network which didn?t involved road grade factors[17] .

This article analyzes spatial accessibility of stores and delimits trade areas based on GIS spatial techniques and breaking point laws. These methods takes into account the traffic network, road hierarchy, the natural conditions and competitive factors which can more comprehensively simulate realistic retail location elements. The main contribution of this paper is to extend the existing trip cost analysis methods and to combine the store attractive factor weighed with traffic condition to delimit the trade areas by incorporating an additional assumption that customers select stores on the basis of distance and attractiveness. Since such a result is more consistent with real trade areas, we contend that the model we introduce represent improvements over the existing methods. This study takes the large scale supermarket in Shanghai central city for example and mainly falls into two parts. On one hand, calculate supermarket accessibility. On the others, delimit trade areas based on breaking point laws.



II.         THE RESEARCH METHODS  A. The Trip Cost Analysis Method  By this method we can acquire the supermarket?s accessibility and visual trade areas. There are lots of accessibility calculating ways. We select the trip cost analysis method which applies network distance from the nearest store to residential spots. Compared with other methods which employ Euclidean distance, the trip cost analysis method has obvious advantages, however does not consider their attractive factors. This article applies ARCGIS software to organize the urban spatial data and social-economic property data which include supermarket spot data, water areas surface data, road line data and street administration property data in study areas.

Then employ the trip cost analysis to acquire the shortest time analysis map. The specific principle lies in the preference [15].

B. Breaking Point Laws and Accessibility Evaluation Index  In general breaking point laws are used to delimit the trade areas among stores. The breaking point laws basic principle: the attractiveness of shop is Proportional to passenger traffic capacity and negatively correlated with time distance. This laws originate from William Reilly, Law of Retail Gravitation(1929), the progressive development includes P. D.

Converse (1949) laws and Applebaum laws(1966) and Gasa laws. Gasa laws come from Converse law (breaking point formula).                  The formula for  ?? ?  ? ?? ?  ? +=  A  B ABB S  S1TT (2)  Where TB is the time from city B to breaking point, TAB is the shortest travel time from city B to city A and SA, SB for the two city scale or attraction, which refers to business areas in this paper. We obtain formula 3 from formula 2  B  B  A  A  S T  S T =  (3-1)  N  N  C  C  B  B  A  A  S T  S T  S T  S T =??????===  (3-2) Formula 3-1 only may calculate one breaking point between  two shops, formula 3-2 can get lots of breaking point which can converge into trade boundaries among many shops.

Spatial accessibility refers to convenience degree of the use  of a specific transport system from a given retail location to other residential location, which refer to time cost in this paper. So we define accessibility evaluation formula for facilities by using shortest time. Accessibility evaluation index:  )min( iji TMA j=                    (4)  where ,i as anyone point in the region, Tij as shortest travel time from any point i in the region to store j by traffic network, Mj as weighted of store shortest time. In this article, I take business area S as store weighted. Ai as accessibility of anyone point. This formula is based on the assumption that consumer always go to the most proximate store by the most convenient traffic ways. At last we can get formula 5 from formula 3 and formula 4.

)min( jiji STA =                   (5)  We demonstrate the formula 5 by GIS spatial techniques based on the trip cost method. Specific methods are included in part three.



III.      TECHNICAL ROUTE  A.  The Study Area and Data Origin  The Study area: In this paper, the scope of the study refer to Shanghai central city district (shanghai city overall plan    definite for 1999-2010). That is in the outer ring (A20 highway) which area is approximate 667.8km2. In this paper, the region within the outer ring is called the Center City District.

Data Source: Shanghai Commercial Net's City Center 75 big scale supermarkets spatial and attribute data in 2005, road spatial data (Road grade) in 2002, the main water system map and the Fifth National Census data of 128 street administrations in Shanghai Center City.

B. The Accessibilities Classification and Trade Areas Visualization Based on Trip Cost Analysis  The trip cost analysis could determine the shortest weighted distance. Based on cost-weighted distance method principle, accessibility calculation process as follows:  Step 1  determine velocity of grid At first, we define cost time through 10 kilometers by  different traffic way as the reference value. Formula  for 6010)(cos ?=  V timet  , where V refers to velocity of different  spatial objectives. We determine the velocity of each grade?s road according to average velocity in study areas. If there is no road or trail, use walk model that V is set for the average walking velocity of 4km / h. If there is the road, the different velocity is set based on road grade. Set express road velocity as 40km/h?major road velocity as 30 km/h, subordinate road velocity as 15 km/h (tab 1). At last we assign a default value of 10 m?10 m to one cell for ensuring the accuracy of research.

average trip  Velocity?  km/h?  Express  road  Main road Subordinate  Road  general  road  40 30 15 10  Cost  15 20 40 60  Average trip  Velocity?  km/h?  No road Huangpu  River  Wu song  River  Other  river   Cost  150 1500 1000 500   Step 2 calculate accessibility and generate the  accessibilities? classification layer Firstly, we integrate all cost layers by overlaying and  produce cost grid layer (fig. 1). Secondly combine cost grid  layer with spatial spot layer of all the supermarkets.

Furthermore use cost weighted distance method to calculate accessibility. Then we obtain accessibility grid layer. At last the accessibility grid Layer is reclassified into 6 grades and generate accessibilities? classification map (fig. 2).

Step 3  delimit trade areas and calculate trade volume base on store size weighted  Firstly calculate every supermarkets separately accessibility grid layer, 75 piece of accessibility grid layers are generated by repeatedly using step 2 method. Secondly separately add store size weight according to formula 5 to the 75 sheet of grid layer. Thirdly all separate weighed layers are overlaid by minimum value way in GIS and acquire trade areas delimitation map (fig. 3). Fourthly transform trade areas delimitation grid layer into vector layer, then combined with population density of every administrative unit who live more than half year in 2000(fig. 4), trade volume layers can be obtained. Finally we can calculate every store?s serve population and visualize them by map.



IV.      ANALYSIS OF THE RESULT                      A. Analysis of Accessibility Result  Accessibility classification grid layers are converted into vector layer in order to obtain accessible area value in different time interval and accessible area analysis table (table 3).

Combined figure 2 with table 3, we can conclude that  Fig 1 Shanghai central city cost grid  layer based on trip cost method  Fig 2 large scale supermarkets? time  accessible classification?s map in  shanghai central city.

In 15 minutes, accessible areas account for 65 percent of central city area. In half hour, accessible areas account for 93 percent of central city area. In sum, accessibility of supermarket in this district is better.

Analysis of Trade Areas Delimitation Result  With the help of ARCGIS software and techniques method and breaking point laws, visual trade areas can be realized.

Judged from Figure 3, this method takes into account the spatial competition, network traffic conditions and the gravity of store scale. Most realistic factors simulation simultaneously makes the result closest to realistic store trade areas.

trade areas spatial characteristic analysis As far as the store trade areas are concerned, the outlets have the largest trade areas that located in central business district and nearby the outer ring. Nearby the inner ring lie the smallest trade areas? outlets, especially in the north-west and south-east, more dense distribution. The outlets who have highest market size locate nearby outer ring and central business district. The mainly outlets which have lowest market size locate in the vicinity of the outside of inner ring, especially in the north-west and south-east (fig.3).



V.           CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION  This study applies GIS spatial analysis techniques to accessibility and trade areas of supermarket in Shanghai. By visualizing the results, it directly reflects supply and demand situations in different regions. Regions with weak accessibilities are identified to evaluate problems in commercial distribution. This method can provide the basis for road planning and selection of retail locations.

Accessibility in the down town area of Shanghai is generally good. The west part of the city has a higher accessibility value than the east part. Regions with larger trade areas are located in central business district and near the outer ring of the city  while along the inner ring, regions with small trade areas are distributed as several clusters at the north-west and south-east.

It also suggests that intensely competitive market regions and weak competitive areas are co-existing.

Although our research suggests that we provide more  effective methods toward trade area definition, several problems will be explored. This method only begins from supply angle and don?t considers the demand too much, purchasing ability and residential trip habits from consumers too much.
