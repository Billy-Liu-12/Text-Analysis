The UHF relay link from Curiosity to the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) incorporates new features enabled by the Electra and Electra-Lite software-defined radios on MRO and Curiosity, respectively.  Specifically, the Curiosity-MRO link has for the first time utilized frequency- agile operations, increased data rates from 256 kbps up to 2048 kbps, employed suppressed carrier modulation and a new Adaptive Data Rate algorithm in which the return-link data rate is varied to match the observed channel condition.  During the first 200 sols, the telecom operations team has been able to tune the radio and protocol parameters to maximize return- link data volume, which is now averaging roughly 500 Mbits per sol or twice the design requirement of 250 Mbits per sol.

The telecom team has also derived new predict models that reduce data volume prediction errors and that quantify the impact of operational modes and link parameters, providing further planning insight for MSL mission operations team.
