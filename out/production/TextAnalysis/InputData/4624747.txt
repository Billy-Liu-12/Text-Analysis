DT-miner: data mining for the people

Abstract   DT-miner, a system that integrates association rules  in the exploration framework of dynamic taxonomies, is presented. Dynamic taxonomies are a general model for the user-centric systematic and guided exploration of complex information bases.

The goal of DT-miner is two-fold: from the one side, it provides a highly interactive, user-centered environment for the exploration of significant association rules according to users? interests. From the other side, exploration through dynamic taxonomies can significantly benefit from association rule metrics that improve user understanding of the information base and can inform the selections he makes.

1. Introduction  Association rules are used to describe interesting patterns in large databases. Research on association rules was prompted by the ?market basket? analysis, where patterns in purchase transactions are to be identified. Their application range is however much larger, as they can used to describe interesting patterns in multidimensional classifications, where items are classified under several concepts.

There are two major problems in traditional techniques for association rule mining. First, since the number of association rules is exponential in the number of purchase items, only frequent itemsets (that is, sets of items that appear in at least a user-defined fraction of purchase transactions) are considered. This reduces the total number of association rules that are considered, but also loses some association rules that can be interesting for the user. Second, a significant portion of mined rules is often irrelevant for the user, so that the task of finding interesting rules within the set of mined rules can be a problem.

Dynamic taxonomies [5, 6, 7] are a general knowledge management model based on a multidimensional classification of heterogeneous data items and are used  to explore/browse complex information bases in a guided yet unconstrained way through a visual interface.

One of the important features of dynamic taxonomies in this context is that they tame the exponential growth of the space defined by all the possible combination of concepts, by dynamically synthesizing specific combinations on demand, according to user?s interests.

This type of exploration, described in the following in more detail, can be used in mining association rules, and it produces rules that are relevant for users and does not require any a priori pruning of the solution space. As we show in the following, association rule mining requires a minor computational overhead on normal dynamic taxonomy operations, and high- performance architectures for dynamic taxonomies are able to manage very large databases with real time operations [8].

On the other side, we believe that association rule metrics are fundamental information for normal dynamic taxonomy exploration because it improves the user understanding of the information base, so that the exploration itself can be improved. Since dynamic taxonomies are geared to casual, untrained users, there is an obvious HCI challenge in making association rule metrics easily understandable and usable. The present paper provides a starting point in this direction.

2. Dynamic Taxonomies Reviewed  The intension of a dynamic taxonomy is a taxonomy designed by an expert. This taxonomy is a concept hierarchy going from the most general to the most specific concepts. Directed acyclic graph taxonomies modeling multiple inheritance are supported but rarely required. A dynamic taxonomy does not require any other relationships in addition to subsumptions (e.g., IS-A and PART-OF relationships).

In the extension, items can be freely classified under n (n>1) topics at any level of abstraction (i.e. at any level in the conceptual tree). This multidimensional classification is a generalization of the monodimensional classification scheme used in   DOI 10.1109/DEXA.2008.60     conventional taxonomies and models common real-life situations. First, items are very often about different concepts: for example, a news item on September 11th, 2001 can be classified under ?terrorism?, ?airlines?, ?USA?, etc. Second, items to be classified usually have different features, ?perspectives? or facets (e.g. Time, Location, etc.), each of which can be described by an independent taxonomy.

In dynamic taxonomies, a concept C is just a label that identifies all the items classified under C. Because of the subsumption relationship between a concept and its descendants, the items classified under C (items(C)) are all those items in the deep extension of C, i.e. the set of items identified by C includes the shallow extension of C (i.e. all the items directly classified under C) union the deep extension of C?s sons. By construction, the shallow and the deep extension for a terminal concept are the same.

There are two important immediate consequences of this approach. First, since concepts identify sets of items, logical operations on concepts can be performed by the corresponding set operations on their extension.

This means that the user is able to restrict the information base (and to create derived concepts) by combining concepts through the normal logical operations (and, or, not). Second, dynamic taxonomies can find all the concepts related to a given concept C: these concepts represent the conceptual summary of C.

Concept relationships other than subsumptions are inferred through the extension only, according to the following extensional inference rule: two concepts A and B are related iff there is at least one item d in the knowledge base which is classified at the same time under A or under one of A?s descendants and under B or under one of B?s descendants. For example, we can infer an unnamed relationship between terrorism and New York, if an item classified under terrorism and New York exists.

2.1 Exploration  The user is initially presented with a tree representation of the initial taxonomy for the entire knowledge base.

Each concept label has also a count of all the items classified under it, i.e. the cardinality of items(C) for all C?s. The initial user focus F is the universe, i.e. all the items in the information base.

In the simplest case, the user selects a concept C in the taxonomy and zooms over it. The zoom operation changes the current state in two ways. First, concept C is used to refine the current user focus F, which becomes F?items(C). Items not in the focus are discarded. Second, the tree representation of the taxonomy is modified in order to summarize the new  focus. All and only the concepts related to F are retained and the count for each retained concept C? is updated to reflect the number of items in the focus F that are classified under C?. The reduced taxonomy is derived from the initial taxonomy by pruning all the concepts not related to F, and it is a conceptual summary of the set of documents identified by F, exactly in the same way as the original taxonomy was a conceptual summary of the universe. In fact, the term dynamic taxonomy indicates that the taxonomy can dynamically adapt to the subset of the universe on which the user is focusing, whereas traditional, static taxonomies can only describe the entire universe.

The retrieval process can be seen as an iterative thinning of the information base: the user selects a focus, which restricts the information base by discarding all the items not in the current focus. Only the concepts used to classify the items in the focus and their ancestors are retained. These concepts, which summarize the current focus, are those and only those concepts that can be used for further refinements. From the human computer interaction point of view, the user is effectively guided to reach his goal by a clear and consistent listing of all possible alternatives, and, in fact, this type of interaction is often called guided thinning or guided navigation.

3. Association Rule Mining  Following Agrawal et al. [1], association rules can be formally stated  as follows: Let  I  =  {il,  i2, ... , im}  be a set of m distinct literals, called items.  Let DS be a set of transactions D, where each transaction D is a set of items such that D?I. We say that a transaction D contains X, a set of some items in I, if X?D. An association rule is an implication of the form X?Y, where X?I, Y?I and X?Y=?. In an association rule X?Y, X is called the antecedent, and Y is called the consequent of the rule.

The traditional (and minimal) measures for association rules are support and confidence [1].

Support(X?Y) measures the ?coverage? of the association rule, that is the probability P(XY) that the rule holds. Confidence(X?Y) measures the conditional probability of Y given X, that is P(Y|X)=P(XY)/P(X).

Other additional measures were proposed. Of these, lift [2], Lift(X?Y)=P(XY)/P(X)P(Y), that measures deviations from uniformity, is widely used. Lift measures how many times more often X and Y occur together than expected if they where statistically independent. Lift is susceptible to noise in small databases and rare itemsets which per chance occur a     few times (or only once) together can produce very large lift values.

3.1 Dynamic Taxonomy Foci and Association Rules  The market basket model underlying association rules can be mapped into the dynamic taxonomy model, by observing that the set I of items can be mapped into the set of terminal concepts in dynamic taxonomies, and that the set D of transactions in association rules is equivalent to the set of abstract documents to be classified under concepts in dynamic taxonomies. The dynamic taxonomy model inherently extends (in a manner analogous to [9]) the base association rule model, because it considers a taxonomic organization of items, rather than the flat organization assumed by most research on association rules.

The key concept in dynamic taxonomies is the reduced taxonomy that summarizes the focus set through the original taxonomy, by pruning from the taxonomy those concepts that are not extensionally related to the focus set. Such a pruning can be implemented by eliminating unrelated concepts altogether, or by showing them in an appropriate format (e.g. grayed) while inhibiting their use for further focus refinements. If selected to refine the current focus, in fact, unrelated concepts would produce an empty focus.

In producing such a reduced taxonomy for a focus F, RT(F), dynamic taxonomy systems usually count the cardinality of the intersection of each concept C in the taxonomy T with the current focus F: count(C|F)=| items(C) ? F |, for ? C?T.

Although the computation of counters is more time consuming, it is widely accepted that it gives an important feedback to the users. In fact, it indicates the effect of a zoom operation on that concept so that the user can easily decide whether additional zoom operations are required. A concept C with count(C|F)=0 is to be pruned, as it is unrelated with the current focus F. Count(C|U) counts items(C), that is the intersection of the deep extension of C with the universe U.

If we consider the reduced taxonomy RT(F) for the current focus F in terms of association rules, every concept C in the reduced taxonomy RT represents two association rules: F?C and C?F, where F is, in general, the conjunct of several concepts, although all boolean operations can be supported.

In this framework, confidence and support can be easily computed as: support(F?C)= support (C?F)=P(FC)=count(C|F)/|U| confidence(F?C)=P(C|F)=P(FC)/P(F)=count(C|F)/|F|  confidence(C?F)=P(F|C)=P(FC)/P(C)= count(C|F)/count(C|U)  The time overhead for computing these quantities is negligible. As regards storage overhead, we need to store, for each concept C?T, count(C|F), that is usually computed in normal operations anyway, and count(C|U), i.e. items(C) in the original taxonomy, which is a constant quantity. In addition, we need the total number of items in the database, and the cardinality of the current focus.

4. Integrating Association Rules with Dynamic Taxonomies  Each zoom operation in a dynamic taxonomy updates the current focus F and produces a reduced taxonomy RT(F) that summarizes that focus. At the same time, each concept C in RT(F) acts as a representative of two association rules: F?C and C?F.

Differently from normal data mining systems, the discovery of meaningful association rules is interactive. The user can freely focus on the concepts he is interested into, at any level of abstraction, and, through the zoom operation, be presented with ?meaningful? association rules that bind the current focus to other concepts. It must be pointed out that a taxonomic organization is at the basis of the dynamic taxonomy model, so that zoom operations can be applied and, consequently association rules discovered, at any level of abstraction.

Clearly, in addition to data mining techniques, human- computer interaction plays a paramount role here. A sequence of numerical measures will not be quite informative to untrained users and probably not useful for experienced users as well. Instead, we focus on a graphical and concise representation of the relevant information. The main indicator chosen is confidence and it is represented on a graphical percentual scale.

On the same scale, the expected confidence ECF is indicated. ECF is computed assuming a uniform distribution of values and antecedent/consequent independence: ECF(X?Y)=P(X)P(Y).

Scaled confidence and scaled expected confidence give an immediate graphical indication of whether the cooccurrence of X and Y is larger or smaller than the one expected under the independence of the two parts of the association rule.

A central point is still missing in the indicators: how statistically significant is the deviation of observed from expected confidence? Measures such as lift (reviewed above) show the ratio between the two values but do not report the statistical significance of deviation. We apply the ?2 test [3], a well-known     statistical test that can be used to evaluate statistically significant differences between proportions for two or more groups in a data set. In particular, we want to determine whether the deviation from independence is significant in the two rules associated to each concept in the reduced taxonomy. We do so by using the contingency 1-degree of freedom tables shown in table 1 and table 2. The ?2 value is computed using Yates? correction for continuity [11] in order to avoid the overestimation of statistical significance when frequencies are small:  ? =  ?? =  N  i i  ii Yates E  EO   2 )5.0|(|?  where Oi are observed values and Ei are estimated values. We conservatively reject the null hypothesis that states that the antecedent and the consequent in a rule are independent at a confidence level of 95% (?2 = 3.841). The default confidence level could be varied by knowledgeable users.

Table 1 ? Contingency table for F?C  F?C Observed Estimated  C count(C|F) (F/|U|)*count(C|U)  ~C F-count(C|F) F-(F/|U|)*count(C|U)   Table 2 ? Contingency table for C?F  C?F Observed Estimated  F count(C|F) (count(C|U)/|U|)*F ~F count(C|U)-  count(C|F) count(C|U)- (count(C|U)/|U|)*F   Statistical significance is indicated in the graphical indicators by color-coding. Thus, a non-significant difference is indicated with a gray color. A statistical significant difference in which observed values are below expected values is color-coded in red, whereas a statistical significant difference in which observed values are above expected values is color-coded in green. Such a color-coding makes the implicit rules: F?~C and C?~F more easily visible.

Finally, we do not use support as normally defined, but for each concept we indicate the ratio count(C|F)/|F|, which gives the support within the focus and gives a picture of how items in the current focus are subdivided among concepts.

5. An Example  The example presented in the demo is taken from a wine database, tracking Italian wines on sale on wine.com in 2006. The demo is powered by  Knowledge Processors? Universal Knowledge Processor (UKP, [4]), the first system to implement dynamic taxonomies and commercially available since 1999 as a web-based system.

Figures 1 to 3 provide sample interactions. Figure 1 shows the entire database. As you know, red wines tend to improve with aging, while white wines do not.

This is confirmed by figure 2, where a zoom on red wines is performed. As you notice, the second bar in the years 1999 to 2002 indicates that 100% of wines from this vintage are red wines (the second bar represents the C?F association rule, while the first bar represents the F?C association rule). In addition, Figure 2 indicates that red wines are mainly from Tuscany (and significantly so), Piedmont and Southern Italy.

Figure 3 reports a zoom on red wines and Piedmont.

Here we notice that there is a significant correlation with the 2001 vintage, that red wines from Piedmont tend to be aged, and on the expensive side. If price is an indication of quality, then they are also pretty good, with prices above average and more than 50% of over 100$ wines being red wines from Piedmont.

6. Conclusions and Future Research  We have shown that dynamic taxonomies can be extended with data mining measures, and offer substantial advantages in terms of unconstrained user- centered exploration, of the ability of selecting an appropriate level of abstraction for the task at hand, and, last but not least, of real-time interactions even for very large problems.

One of the important benefits of dynamic taxonomies is the fact that they make knowledge that is otherwise buried inside the raw data, visible and usable. Such knowledge plays a fundamental role in informed exploration. Beside the pragmatic use of this knowledge in finding the right object, the insights gained in exploring the corpus can be interesting per se, and often more interesting than the task at hand.

Even in the simple exploration we described as an example, unknowledgeable users can get important insight in the internal ?laws? of the corpus: namely, that red wines tend to be aged, that 2001 was a pretty good vintage, that Tuscany produces mostly red wine (Chianti and Brunello are examples), etc. In short, a better understanding of the corpus, that generates knowledge which can be exploited for more informed selections.

The system described here (online at [12]) is an initial prototype that is intended as a test bed. Work on extending the current framework for increased expressivity is under way. In particular, we are     addressing the production of general association rules.

Association rules that are used in the current implementation are currently restricted to rules having a general boolean combination of concepts for the antecedent, but a single concept for the consequent, or vice versa (since the rule shown are both F?C and C?F). It can be useful to remove this restriction in order to have both the antecedent and the consequent represented by general boolean expressions on concepts.
