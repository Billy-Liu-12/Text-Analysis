Fishery Knowledge Discovery Based on SVM and Fuzzy Rule Extraction

Abstract? In the area of ocean fisheries research, one hotspot is the use of marine environment factors for fisheries forecast.

This paper fits in the category using fishery knowledge discovery based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) and fuzzy rule extraction. It takes the Indian Ocean big-eye tuna fishery as its testing ground. Firstly, the support vectors are obtained by training the SVM with some sample data. Then the rules are extracted by the fuzzy classifier method. Meanwhile, a fishery forecasting model is established based on Support Vector Regression (SVR). Experimental results show that the fishery knowledge obtained is of a forceful interpretive capacity, which is ideal for explaining the formation mechanism of fishing grounds. The established fishery forecasting model provides a high level of information accuracy which can be further enhanced by additional fishing effort.

I.  INTRODUCTION With the development of pelagic fishery, the  investigation into the effective forecast of fishing ground has become a hotspot of ocean fisheries research. In China, some researches have been conducted to predict the fishing grounds in terms of their quantity. For example, Chen et al [1] analyzed and investigated the relationship of temperature and the catch per unit effort of North Pacific squid and built a predictive equation. Xu [2] selected a group of strong impact factors from a large number of marine environmental factors and established a mathematical prediction model of Western and Central Pacific Ocean tuna purse-seine production through multiple linear regressions. However, the dynamic marine environment factors are inconsistent with the premise of multiple linear regression analysis, which requires that the variables must be independent and meet normal distribution.

This paper utilizes several theories including Support Vector Machine (SVM) and fuzzy theory. It proposes a novel fishery knowledge discovery model based on SVM and fuzzy rule extraction. It establishes a fishery forecasting method based on support vector regression (SVR). Indian Ocean bigeye tuna is used as a testing ground for this research.



II. SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE Support Vector Machine, first proposed by Cortes and  Vapnik in 1995[3], has had a huge influence on machine learning in recent years. The basic idea involves mapping the training data set into high dimensional feature space by non- linear mapping. The purpose is to change the linear inseparable data sets of the input space into the linear separable data sets by mapping the linear inseparable data sets into high dimensional feature space, and then to build an optimal separating hyperplanes of maximum range in feature space. This is equivalent to establishing an optimal non- linear boundary in input space[4].

SVM is widely used to solve the problem of classification and regression. According to the different problems to be solved, it can be divided into support vector classification (SVC) and support vector regression (SVR)[5] Support Vector Machine in the classification applications (pattern recognition) actually estimate the indicator function.

If it is extended into estimating real function, it can be changed into a regression problem[6].

Forecasting is to construct and to use models in order to estimate non-label samples, or the attribute values and value interval of the given samples. The goal of forecasting model is to predict the unknown variables under the situation of other given variables.



III. FUZZY RULES MODELS The fuzzy set theory and fuzzy logic proposed by Zadeh[7]  largely reflect the process of human cognition about objective things. It is easy for us to understand the reasoning process using the fuzzy rules to do pattern classification. The fuzzy rules model is as follows:  1 1 2 2: . , . , ..., .

j j j  j m mR IF x A x A x A . 1, 2,...,jTHEN y B j n=  where, 1 2( , , ..., )mx x x x= are input variables, j  iA is the semantic value of the ith input variables in jth rule, y is the output variables, jB is the semantic value of the conclusion y in jth rule.

Fuzzy sets make some feature belong to some set with a certain degree. The degree is a value between ?0? and ?1?, that is, degree of membership. The implement of mapping a certain element into a proper membership   _____________________________    degree is determined by membership function.

Membership function can be any curve of arbitrary form.

Thus the unique constraint condition is the range of value must be in [0,1]. According to the characteristic of the marine environment factors, and the advantage that the triangular membership function can meet normal demands, the triangular membership function is adopted and expressed as follows:  ( )   ,  ,  0                       otherwise  x mid  x left x left x mid  mid left x  right x x right x mid  right mid  ?  =  ? ? <  ? =  ? ? >  ?  ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ??

IV. KEY TECHNOLOGY  A. Fishery knowledge discovery based on SVM and fuzzy rule extraction  1) Acquire support vectors Support Vector Machine classification algorithm is used  to acquire support vectors through training the randomly selected marine environment data and fisheries operating data. This problem belongs to non-linear classification problem, which mainly uses non-linear transformation to change the problem into linear problem of a high dimensional space. It is related to the inner product operation between training samples, so according to Functional Theory, instead of computing the dot product on the transformed data tuples, it turns out that it is mathematically equivalent to applying a kernel function to the original input data instead.

Kernel function is a function K, for all ,i jx x K? to meet:  ( , ) ( ( ) ( ))i j i jK x x x x? ?= ?                       (2)  Where, ?  is the mapping from X to (inner product) feature space F .

The kernel functions are as follows: ? Gaussian radial basis function kernel:  2|| || ( , ) exp 22  x xiK x xi ?  ? = ?  ? ? ? ? ? ?  (3)  Where, ix is the center of the kernel function, ?  is the width parameter.

? Polynomial kernel of degree d :  ( , ) ( )i i dK x x x x c= ? + , 0, 1, 2, ...,c d N? =        (4)  ? Sigmoid kernel: ( , ) tanh( ( ) )i iK x x v x x c= ? + , ,v c are constants  (5)  2) Extract rules based on fuzzy classification  When the fuzzy basic function is the Gaussian membership function or kernel functions of SVM meet the Mercer conditions and simultaneously they are the bounded functions, Support Vector Machine problem is similar to general fuzzy rules model. Therefore, rules extraction can be achieved through a method that combines support vector machine model and fuzzy rules model algorithm.

In SVM classification problems, the final separating hyperplane is defined as:  ( ) ( , )i i i SV  f x K x x? ?  = ?     (6)  ( )i i i SV  w x? ? ?  = ?    (7)  Where i i iy? ?= , i? is Lagrange multiplier, w is the weight vector.

In formula (6), only a few of sample points 0i? ? , that is support vectors, suppose support vectors  { }1 2, , ...,i i i SVSV x x x= , SV is the number of the support vectors, ijx expresses the ith input value of the jth  support  vector. Coefficient sets { }, , ...,1 2 | |CO i i i SV? ? ?= , so formula (6) and (7) can be written as:   | | ( ) ( , )ik  k  SV f x K x xik?  = ?=                    (8)   | | ( )ik ik  k  SV w x? ?  = ?=    (9)  As i i iy? ?= , SV  and CO  can make the following forms of fuzzy rules tenable:  IF x close to ikx  THEN i?  close to | |ik? , 1, 2, ..., | |k SV=   Figure 1.  Principle of extracting fuzzy rules  Because the support vectors are the points nearest to the separating hyperplane, they are often distributed on the edges of two fuzzy sets[8,9]. For the ith  factor in this experiment,     ijC is the jth  level, k iju is the degree of membership of ix on  ijC , where ix is the factor of the kth  support vector. The principle of fuzzy rules extraction is shown in Figure 1 .

Figure 1 shows fuzzy rules extraction about a two-factor  two-level experiment where input sample is 1 2( , , )x x y ,  11C and 12C are the semantic values of 1x , 21C and 22C are the semantic values of 2x . Through SVM training, two support  vectors can be acquired, namely 1P =(0.7,0.7,? ), ?  2P =(0.95,0.9,??)?  According to Figure 1, for 1P , 1 1 11 12u u< ?  1 1 21 22u u> , so  12C and 21C  are selected, as the semantic values of this rule, the rule is:  1 1 12 2 21: . , .    .R IF x C x C THEN y I  For 2P , similarly, the other rule is:  2 1 11 2 22: . , .    .R IF x C x C THEN y II  B. Establishing fishery forecasting methodl based on SVR SVR? ? , SVR? ? and LS SVR? are three of the most widely  used SVR forms applying to regression estimate[5]. In order to regression estimate nonlinear functions, the insensitive loss function ? is introduced, ?  directly controls the estimated accuracy of functions, thus SVR? ?  has robustness and sparsity. And this kind of sparsity is very important in estimating  dependency relationship of  huge amount of  data in high dimensional space.

Given a training set ( ){ },T x yi i=  ( )( 1,2,3,..., , ), ( x=R , )ni m x y y Ri i= ? ? =  Where, input xi and associated targets yi  , the goal of regression problem is to fit a flat function ( )f x  which approximates the relation inherited between the data set points and it can be used to infer the output y  for a new input data point x . Through using nonlinear transformation ( )x x???? , map input space into high dimensional feature space (Hilbert Space), thus the nonlinear function estimate problem can be transformed into linear function estimate problem of high dimensional feature space[6].

Taking the living habits and habitats of Indian Ocean fisheries big-eye tuna into account, make xi to be marine environment factors, n is the number of the elements, yi?R is the number of catch of the big-eye tuna, m is the number of input data.

Suppose the function f(x) is expressed as: ( ) , ( )f x w x b?= + , : , ,nR F F b R? ? ? ??     (10)  Where, b is a bias term, ? is a nonlinear map which mapping the input x  into a high-dimensional feature space F.

Select the proper positive number ? and C, and the proper kernel function K ? ?-insensitive loss function is defined as:  { 0 | ( ) |( , ( )) | ( ) |  y f x L y f x  y f x otherwise ?  ? ? <  = ? ?  (11)  Thus, the regression problem can be written as a convex optimization problem:    1 *min || || ( )  m i ii  C? ? ? = ?+ +             (12)  y -<?,j(x )>-b ?+?  s.t.    <?,j(x )>+b-y ?+?  ? ,? 0  i i i  i i i  i i ?  ?  ?  ?  (13)  Through introducing a Lagrange function, the optimization problem (12) and (13) can be solved in their dual formulation, which is expressed as follows:  max ( )( ) ( ), ( )  , 12  ( ) ( ) 1 1  m x xi i j j i ji j  m m yi i i i ii i  ? ? ? ? ? ?  ? ? ? ? ?  ? ?? + ? < > ?? =  ? ?+ + ?? ? = =    (14)  ( ) 0  s.t.

, [0, ],  i=1,2,...,m  m  i i i  i i C  ? ?  ? ?  ?  = ?  ? =?  ?                         (15)  The support vectors can be obtained,  ( ) ( )  m  i i i i  x? ? ? ?? =  ?= ?    (16)  The value of b can be computed according to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. Select different kernels K to be cyclotron of the inner product, support vector regression is expressed as:    *( ) ( ) ( , ) m  i f x K x x bi i i? ?=  ?= ? +                       (17)  Using support vector machine to solve the regression function estimate problem requires three free parameters: insensitive value ? , regularized parameter C and kernel parameters. Through controlling C and ? , the generalization ability of support vector machine can be enhanced.



V. EXPERIMENTS  A. Data preparation Fisheries operating data for the testing of the model is  taken as original sample data from the Japan based Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) official website. The selected statistical data are abundant and normative. The corresponding Indian Ocean environment data is extracted from the environment database owned by Columbia University using our own purpose built software. The original data is sorted by month and year with a     corresponding record for every specific area in the Indian Ocean.

B. Fishery static knowledge discovery On the basis of the research by domain experts in relation  to the living habits of the Indian Ocean bigeye tuna, the following six environmental factors are chosen as the training samples: temperature of sea water in depth of 187.5 meters, 212.5 meters, 237.5 meters and 262.5 meters; salinity of sea water in depth of 212.5 meters; vertical flow of sea water in depth of 225 meters, and the corresponding fisheries operating data of these depths above. The support vectors are acquired by support vector machine training. Then fuzzy rules are extracted by the principle of fuzzy rules extraction.

In this experiment, 14 pieces of static knowledge can be discovered with a list of three of them shown below:  In Table I, T represents the temperature of sea water, S represents the salinity of sea water, and VF represents the vertical flow of sea water.

Fishery forecasting model establishing The catch forecasting model can be established using the  data from 2000 to 2005 as the training samples, the data of 2006 as the test sample and taking into account the fishing effort factor. The fishing effort is a key impact factor, especially in long-lining operations.

Comparing the pre and post adding fishing effort, the forecasting results of every kind of kernel function are shown in Table II, the forecast accuracy are apparently improved.

After adding the fishing effort, the forecasting result of Polynomial kernel function is improved more obviously than other two kernel functions. Part of forecasting result of Polynomial kernel function is shown in Figure 2.

VI. CONCLUSIONS This research proposes a novel fishery knowledge  discovery model to address the challenges posed by the dynamic marine environment factors. In the case of reference to the abundant Indian Ocean big-eye operating data and the Indian Ocean environment data, the authors argue that the marine environment remote sensing data can not satisfy the postulation of the multiple linear regressions because it has neither normal distribution nor independent identity distribution. The model presented in this paper is based on Support Vector Machine, fuzzy theory, and extracting the knowledge expressed as production rule. Meanwhile, a fishery forecasting method is established using support vector regression. The resulting model can acquire the fishery knowledge with a forceful interpretive capacity and enhance the universality and sharability of forecasting knowledge. It can also provide theoretical and methodological development for intelligent information processing applied to pelagic fishery forecasting.
