A New Weighted Association Rule Suitable for Causes and Effects Analysis

Abstract  A new weighted association rule algorithm is discussed. It is based on the mining algorithms of minwal(0) and minwal(w). The new algorithm can effectively mine the association rules which define some attributes as antecedent partial, while others as consequent partial. The new algorithm also can effectively mine the association rules with low support and high confidence, and these association rules have greater significant in some application.

1. Introduction  When using ordinary association rule algorithms to  mine a database, each attribute in a record?s attribute  set is considered to have same function. The ordinary  association rule algorithms can not effectively discover  the association rules which can reveal causes and  effects relationships between attributes. But sometimes,  the causes and effects relations in a database are  valuable. Therefore, a new weighted association rule  algorithm was promoted to study the relationships  between antecedent attributes and consequent  attributes.

Launching the discussion from a example. In  highway maintenance information system, the road  examination data on one road section is saved as a  record in the database. Considering the expression  ? ?nmmll jjiiii ,,,,,,,, 111 ??? ??  as the attribute set. The expression ? ?mll iiii ,,,, 11 ?? ? represents the antecedent attribute set. The expression ? ?lii ?,1 represents the Boolean attribute partial of antecedent  attribute set, including surface layer structure, roadbed  structure, highway ground type. The expression  ? ?ml ii ,,1 ??  represents the value attribute partial of antecedent attribute set, including construction quality  (compactness, issn, geometry size, smoothness),  climatic conditions (solar radiation, high temperature  process, precipitation, high-low temperature cyclic  changing process and extreme low temperature  condition) traffic flow, service time and so on. While  The expression ? ?nm jj ,,1 ??  represents the consequent attribute set which is caused by the  antecedent attribute set. The Boolean attributes in the  consequent attribute set is used to describe road  damage form, such as, the crack types (transverse  crack, longitudinal crack, chap), the distortion types  (wheel rut, heave and frost heave, settlement), the  surface damages (grinds, looseness, pit, weeping). The  value attributes in the consequent attribute set is used  to describe the road surface condition index (PCI), the  road surface travel performance index (RQI), the  strength of pavement index (SSI), the road surface  anti-slippery performance index (BPN) and the road  surface performance figure (PQI), they can be divided  into 4 ranks, respectively, superiorly, good, center,  miss.

When mining association rules from the road  examination database, meeting two questions.

First question, the highway maintaining personnel want to obtain association rules like this YX ? , and X  is the subset of? ?mll iiii ,,,, 11 ?? ? , while Y  is  subset of? ?nm jj ,,1 ?? . The expression ???YX has been established automatically. When an ordinary  association rule algorithm is used to mine association  rules, the function of each attribute is considered as   DOI 10.1109/FGCN.2008.32     same in attribute set. That is to say, the associations  rules obtained by an ordinary association rule algorithm are only like this YX ? , while X and Y are the subset of? ?nmmll jjiiii ,,,,,,,, 111 ??? ?? .

Second question, for most roads, the most road sections are in their effective service life. All kinds of road damages occur only in the small number of road sections. Therefore, the association rules related with road damages has very small support. Possibly, the association rules related with road damages cannot be excavated with ordinary association rule algorithms. If through reducing-support way to mine the association rules related with road damages, these association rules may be submerged in the middle of massive other rules.

The highway maintaining personnel exactly care for these association rules related with road damages. This article proposed an improved weighted association rule algorithm to solve above two problems.

2. An improved weighted association rule algorithm  Supposing ? ?mjjiiii ?54321 ,,, is the record attribute set of a study data.  In the improved algorithm, firstly, specialized knowledge should be used to divide  the attribute set ? ?mjjiiii ?54321 ,,,  into two parts which are antecedent attribute set and consequent attribute set, and respectively expressed as  ? ?4321 ,,, iiii , ? ?mjj ,,5 ? .

Then the antecedent attribute set ? ?4321 ,,, iiii  should be treated. This treating process also can be regard as one kind of mapping. Supposing the  antecedent attributes 21 , ii  are Boolean attributes, the  value is 0 or 1; the antecedent attributes 43 , ii  are  value attributes. The attribute  3i  is divided into  3n parts, and the attribute  4i  is divided into 4n parts.

The arrangement 4321 iiii  has 4322 nnR 			? kinds of result, namely 4321 1100 , 4321 1101 , 4321 1110 ,  ,,1111 4321 ?? 432111 nn . So the antecedent  attribute set ? ?4321 ,,, iiii can be mapped to a new attribute set ? ?Rkkk ,,, 21 ? . The attribute  Riki  1, is a Boolean attribute, and represents one result of the arrangement  4321 iiii  . Now  ? ?Rkkk ,,, 21 ? is the new attribute set of the study  data. For any record in data, only one attribute  Riki  1,  is 1 value, others are 0 value. After mapping, the original attribute set  ? ?mjjiiii ?54321 ,,,  will be expressed as a new one? ?mR jjkkk ,,,,,, 521 ?? .

The literatures [1] [2] [3] [4] proposed a weighted association rule concept for Boolean attributes, and produces two kinds of weighted association rule algorithm: minwal(0) and minwal(w). This article borrows the weighted thought. Establishes the powers  Rwww ,,, 21 ?  corresponding to the new attributes  Rkkk ?,, 21 . Supposing the number of those record  attribute 1?ik is ikn , the power value of the attribute  ik  is  i  i  k  R  i k  i n  n w  ? ?? 1 .                                                 (1)  Defines the weighted support of rule Yki ?  as  ?  ?  ? ?  ? ??  R  i k  i ii  i n  YkSupport wYkWSup   ,    (2)  and  ? ?mjjY ,,5 ?? .                                        (3) Then the weighted support is equal to  ?  ?  ?  ? YkWCon n  YkSupport  n  YkSupport  n  n YkWSup  i  k  i  R  i k  i  k  R  i k  i  i  i  ii  i  ??  ? ?  ? ??  ?  ?  ?  ?    (4)  In above formula, as we know ? ?  ? R  i kk ii  nn  , so the  change that ? ?  R  i ki  n  is substituted by ik  n  in the  denominator can enlarge the influence of the support  number ? YkSupport i ?  which possible is small.

Now ? ikWSup  are equal to 1. Namely, the weighted support ? YkWSup i ?  is the confidence of Yki ? .

Thus this algorithm can concentrate to mine those high-confidence rules, and ignore the influence from     small support number ? YkSupport i ? . Moreover, this weighted support also conforms to such a habit in the practical application that the support is smaller than 1.

The existing weighted association rule programs can be used to realize this improved algorithm. The existing algorithms which produce frequent set are suitable to Boolean attribute set. So the attribute set  ? ?mR jjkkk ,,,,,, 521 ?? need be transformed into the Boolean attribute set? ?sRR jjkkk ?? ,,,, 121 ? .

A power Vector ? ?11,1,,,, 21 ?? Rwww  is assigned to the Boolean attribute set. Set a value to the weighted  support ? YkWSup i ?  which is equal to the confidence ? YkWCon i ? , and mine the frequent set.

Because all ? ikWSup is equal to 1, all frequent set certainly includes ik , and only one ik . In this association rule algorithm, the condition that  confidence ? YkWCon i ?  is equal to the weighted support ? YkWSup i ? guarantee the association rules form is Yki ? .

Last step is the mergence of the association rules. It is possible that one consequent attribute set is related with many antecedent attributes. For instance, if the  antecedent attribute sets 4321 1101 and 4321 1111 cause  the same consequent attribute combination ? ?5jY ? with same or close confidence. Then 4321 1101  and 4321 1111  can be merged into 431 111 . Like this, the number of association rules can be reduced further.

Some clearer and simpler association rules can be obtained.

3. Application  Take the maintenance data of Dalian to Dandong highway as an example. The data is shown in Table 1.

Firstly organize the data waiting for mining to transaction table. Then use the improved weighted association rule to analysis the data. There are two important discoveries: the SSI index of 75% road sections with low constructing-quality is also low, and the SSI index of 61% high traffic flow road sections is low  Table 1. Maintenance data Road  section Current pavement  strength (issn) Construction  quality Traffic load Climate  type  0 0.553 60 high 1 1 0.682 92 high 1 2 0.564 91 high 1 3 0.734 79 high 1 4 0.653 80 high 1 5 0.912 75 high 1 6 0.921 83 high 1 7 0.836 77 high 1 8 0.967 93 high 1  ?? ?? ?? ?? ??  109 0.682 96 medium 3 110 0.55 88 medium 3 111 0.506 90 medium 3 112 0.493 71 medium 3 113 0.648 75 medium 3 114 0.877 89 medium 3 115 0.622 78 medium 3 116 0.919 94 medium 3  4. Conclusion  This improved algorithm can effectively make causes and effects analysis, and also can effectively mine the association rules with lower support and high confidence.

The limitation of the new algorithm lies in the fact that the new algorithm can fall into computation load oversized disaster, when the number of origin attribute is more. This algorithm is suitable for the data which origin attribute number is generally few.
