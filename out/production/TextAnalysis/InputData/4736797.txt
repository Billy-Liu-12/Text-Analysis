Visualization and Analysis of GPU Summer School Applicants and Participants

Abstract?With the recent development of petascale computing systems, a long-term effort is needed to educate and train the next generation of researchers. As part of its graduate education component, the Virtual School of Computational Science and Engineering held a summer school in August 2008 entitled ?Accelerators for Science and Engineering Applications,? providing participants with knowledge and hands-on experience with graphics processing units (GPUs). In this paper, we present visualizations exploring the broad spectrum of summer school applicants and participants. We examine demographic information of the overall applicant pool, accepted and attending applicants, and remote participants, as well as apply hierarchical clustering and rule association techniques to all applicant data. These statistical and data mining analyses demonstrate the wide range of fields of study where research applications can be readily accelerated through the use of massively parallel computing resources.

I. INTRODUCTION The Virtual School of Computational Science and  Engineering held its first summer school ?Accelerators for Science and Engineering Applications? August 18-22, 2008 at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) as part of the educational component of the Blue Waters petascale project.  Blue Waters is a joint effort by NCSA, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), IBM, and the Great Lakes Consortium for Petascale Computing (GLCPC), and it is supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF). The lead instructors for the summer school were Wen-Mei Hwu, professor in Electrical and Computer Engineering at UIUC, and David Kirk, Chief Scientist at NVIDIA Corporation. The Director of the Virtual School is Sharon C. Glotzer, and the Director of NCSA is Thom H. Dunning.

The summer school provided attending students the opportunity to learn about using graphics processing units (GPUs) and multi-core technology for accelerating research applications through lectures, hands-on labs, access to NCSA?s 16-node cluster of GPUs, and networking and collaboration with fellow participants.  Remote participation was made possible through streaming video, an online discussion board, and other web content.

A total of 179 students and researchers applied to the summer school, and 49 were accepted to the program. Forty- two attended the five-day program, and 30 applicants signed up in advance to participate remotely. Not included in these lists are the Virtual School Director, UIUC Engineering faculty, graduate teaching assistants, and NCSA staff.

We present four sets of visualizations, based on information about the original applicant pool and two subsets of this population: accepted/attending applicants and remote participants. We also analyze the IP addresses and access timestamps to the streaming video of summer school lectures and presentations. Finally, we apply data mining algorithms to the applicant pool to create interactive visualizations.

Our goal is examine the wide range of students who applied for and who participated in the summer school. This will serve to give insight into the students and the fields of study for which GPU and multi-core technology will be useful and readily applicable. We focus on demographics (gender and graduate status), institutions, and departments of applicants and participants. Other aspects we investigate include fellowships received and GPU-related research. We also analyze responses from a confirmation survey completed by attending and remote participants.

The visualizations were created using Microsoft Visio and Processing, an open-source language and development environment. For the data mining analysis, we used Meandre, an open-source data flow execution engine created by the Automated Learning Group at NCSA, of which Loretta Auvil is project lead.

II. ALL APPLICANTS A total of 179 students applied to the summer school  through an online form. Doctoral students were predominant.

Nearly a fifth of the applicants were female.

These applicants came from 51 institutions across the United States and internationally. All institutions in the Committee on Institutional Cooperation (CIC), a consortium of 12 Midwestern research universities, were represented.

There were several international applicants, including students at seven universities outside the United States and on three continents.  The 179 applicants conduct research in 30 distinct departments, institutes, and research laboratories.

Fifty-four are fellowship recipients, and 13.41% mentioned the usage of GPUs in their research descriptions.



III. ACCEPTED AND ATTENDING APPLICANTS After an evaluation of the applicants, 49 were accepted to  the summer school. Forty-four were initially confirmed to participate on-site, and 42 attended the program. Over a quarter of attending applicants were female, in contrast to 19.55% of the overall applicant pool.

Twenty-eight institutions are represented by the 49 accepted candidates, including at least one accepted applicant from each CIC institution. The 42 attending applicants come from 24 institutions.

Over half (64.29%) of the attending 42 applicants have been awarded a fellowship, and three applicants have two fellowships each.  In addition, 20.45% of the 42 who attended the program do GPU-related research, as compared to 13.41% of the total applicant population.



IV. REMOTE PARTICIPANTS Remote participation in the summer school was possible  via streaming video feeds of the presentations, including a live high-definition feed hosted by the Electronic Visualization Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). Training accounts on NCSA?s GPU cluster were provided to students who requested access.

An invitation for off-site participation was sent to all initial applicants who were not accepted to attend the summer school. Of these, 30 elected to participate remotely prior to August 18, 2008. Two institutions outside the United States were represented.

The IP addresses, access times, and other system information of anyone who viewed the streaming videos were logged by NCSA. The organization and geographic location associated with each IP address was determined through a lookup to online WHOIS servers, selected based on region. Fig. 1 shows the 172 unique IP addresses logged.

The predominant country of origin for the IP addresses was the United States, but five other countries were recorded as having accessed the video. Prior to the program, students from 17 institutions expressed interest in remote participation, and 15 institutions were logged.  Three institutions were not represented by any applicants in the original pool of 179.



V. DATA MINING ANALYSIS We used data mining techniques to further investigate the  summer school participants based on their application information. The two methods we chose to analyze the pool of 179 applicants were hierarchical clustering and association rule algorithms. We applied the algorithms to the data in Meandre to create interactive visualizations. The rule association algorithm used implements FP-growth using 6 maximum items, a minimum support of 10% and a minimum confidence of 70%. The clustering algorithm used hierarchical clustering with a distance threshold of 0.1, and prior to applying the algorithm, we converted nominal data such as gender and institution to numerical values.

We generated association rules for applicants? degree, departments, gender, publication, and received fellowships.

The major patterns that the algorithm revealed confirmed our intuition. For example, applicants without publications were unlikely to have a fellowship; applicants pursuing doctoral degrees were more likely to have publications. We did not find any significant association between gender or department and publication or fellowship status.

We also created clustering models of the applicant data, focusing again on demographics as well as text mining analysis of applicant research descriptions. In particular, the use of clustering for text mining produced interesting insight into the applicants. Frequently mentioned words included ?time,? ?performance,? ?rate,? ?simulation,? ?modeling,? and ?optimization.? This implies that the applicants were motivated to participate in the summer school because of the time and performance concerns for their research or due to the use of GPUs for simulation, modeling, and optimization.



VI. CONCLUSIONS The goal of the summer school was to provide graduate  and doctoral students from all disciplines with knowledge and hands-on experience with massively parallel computing resources, and these visualizations on demographic data provide a closer look at the backgrounds and fields of study of applicants and participants of the summer school. We also produced interactive visualizations through our data mining analysis, which confirmed our intuition about the applicants and also granted new insight.

Students applied from many institutions, both in the United States and abroad, and are currently conducting research in a wide spectrum of areas. Many participated remotely through the resources available, such as streaming video and other online content.  Of the students who participated, some are already utilizing GPUs in their current research.  With the exposure from the summer school, all participants have gained knowledge on how to develop their own software for accelerating their research applications through the use of massively parallel computing resources.
