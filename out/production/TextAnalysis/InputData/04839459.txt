An FPGA-Based Data Acquisition and Processing

Abstract?The MATMOS Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR)  spectrometer is a concept instrument designed to measure the  Mars atmospheric composition using solar occultation from  orbit. MATMOS requires high sampling rate (up to 300 kHz),  high dynamic range (up to 22 bits) data acquisition to record  time-domain interferograms which get converted to spectra  on-board the spacecraft. Our previous work presented a sys-  tem that utilized the Xilinx Virtex-4FX hybrid-FPGA to pro-  cess raw interferogram data in a mixed HW/SW environment.

We are now expanding the role of the FPGA to the analog data  acquisition domain by interfacing it to high bandwidth, high  data rate analog-to-digital converters. The quality of the col-  lected data is verified by recording ground-based solar spectra  with the existing JPL MkIV interferometer using the new ac-  quisition system in parallel with the standard MkIV electron-  ics. Processing time is reduced by upgrading to the Xilinx  Virtex-5FXT FPGA.
