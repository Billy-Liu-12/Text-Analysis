Privacy Preserving Association Rules Mining Based on Data Disturbance and  Inquiry Limitation

Abstract?Privacy is an important issue in data mining and knowledge discovery. In this paper, we use the randomized  response technology to conduct association rule mining. We  propose a privacy preserving association rule mining  algorithm which is called DDIL based on data disturbance and  inquiry limitation. Applying DDIL on the data set, the original  data can be disturbed and hidden and the degree of  privacy-preserving is improved effectively. Specially, a high  effective method of generating frequent items from  transformed data sets is proposed. Our experiments  demonstrate that when the random parameters are chosen  suitably, our methods are effective and provide acceptable  values in practice for balancing privacy and accuracy.?

Introduction   As the rapid development of the database and network technology, various businesses have accumulated massive useful data. How to extract knowledge for the decision making from the data has become essential. As a powerful data analysis tool, data mining can discover the potential patterns and rules from the data. However, because the mined information or data contain some sensitive information which must be preserved, data mining should be carried out on the premise of the privacy protection.

Especially at this time, data mining and knowledge discovery have made great progress. They increase the risk when the information is open to the public, which may constitute a threat to the privacy and information security.

Therefore, privacy-preserving data mining will be a vital and challenging subject in the future.

Association rules mining is one of the most active research areas in data mining, and it was firstly proposed by Agrawal[1] in 1993. Association rules mining brings us many privacy questions as well as many conveniences. Such  as, we can find out connection of many diseases through data mining on data sets about patients? cases. However, it is inevitable to expose data of cases in the process of data mining with general approaches, and result in leakage of patient privacy. Besides, related information among illegal records, insurance claims cases, customer's bank card transactions and so on are vital for governments and enterprises to make decisions, and at the same time are individual privacy concerned by people greatly[8]. In future, it is a challenging topic to protect customers? privacy data while we are carrying on data mining.

2. Related Work  2.1 Association Rules Mining  Association rules can be expressed as: X => Y, where X and Y are set of items. Each rule has two measures of value: support and confidence, which indicate the frequencies of the occurring patterns. And the detail of association rules is in [1], [2] and [3]. Association rules mining is to find all the association rules whose confidence and support are larger than the given minimum thresholds. Mining association rules can be reduced to two steps: (1) Find all large itemsets for a predetermined minimum support. (2) Generate the association rules from the large itemsets. The most crucial factor that affects the performance of mining association rules is to find efficient method to resolve the first problem.

2.2 Data Disturbance and Inquiry Limitation   According to the basic strategy, privacy-preserving data  mining approaches were mainly divided into two categories: data disturbance and inquiry limitation[3]. The data disturbance strategy firstly carries on the disturbance to the original data through the methods of data transformation, data discrimination and putting noise in the data, then the disturbed data is carried on data mining, and the patterns and rules are obtained[8].The inquiry limitation strategy uses data hiding, data sampling and data partition to avoid the whole original data being held by the data miner, then the   DOI 10.1109/ICICSE.2009.30     data mining results are obtained through using the probability statistical methods or distributed computational methods[9]. However, these two kinds of strategies both have some inherent defects. When the strategy of data disturbance is used, all transformed data are directly related to original data. However, when the strategy of inquiry limitation is used, all provided data are the real original data.

Those methods can reduce the privacy-preserving degree of the methods preserving privacy data [9]. In order to make up the two strategies and improve protection degree to privacy data, this paper proposes an algorithm which unifies the two strategies at the same time.

3. Privacy Preserving Association Rules  Mining Algorithm  3.1 Randomized Data Disturbance Approach  It is supposed that D is a Boolean transaction data set in which each row denotes a transaction record, k is the number of distinct items in D, and a transaction record T can be expressed as T=[ i1?i2???ik ], in which ij (1?j?k) denotes the value of the jth item whose value is 0 or 1.In order to protect each transaction data in D ,we adapt a randomized disturbance approach upon D to generate disturbed transaction set D?. Then association rules are discovered in the original transaction set D by reconstructing the support of the frequent itemsets founded in D?.

Given randomized parameters p1?p2 and p3 which are satisfied with 0 ? p1,p2,p3 ? 1 and p1+p2+p3=1. By randomized disturbance approach, we can transform each transaction T=[i1, i2, ?, ik] in D to T?=[i1? , i2,?, ik? ] , in which ij? is equal to ij by the probability p1, ij? is equal to 1? ij by the probability p2 and ij? is equal to 0 by the probability p3.

When the probability p1 or p2 is randomly selected, the algorithm implements the strategy of data disturbance.

When the probability p3 is randomly selected, the algorithm implements the method of data hiding and is the application of the inquiry limitation strategy.

The pseudo-code of the randomized data disturbance approach is as follows:  Input: original transaction sets D, random parameters p1, p2 and p3.

Output: transformed transaction sets D? 1. for each transaction T=[ i1?i2???ik ]?D { 2. for each item ij?T { 3.  Producing a random number r; 4.  if (r ? p1) then 5. ij? ?ij 6. else 7. if(p1? r ? p1+ p2) then  8.ij? ?1 - ij 9. else 10. ij?? 0 11.} 12.Put T?=[i1? , i2???, ik? ] into D  ? 13.} During the process of mining, the disturbed data sets D?  and parameters p1?p2 and p3 are known. By analyzing the process of support reconstruction of 1-itemset, we can deduce the process of support reconstruction of n-itemset.

3.2 1-Itemset Support Reconstruction  c1D and c0D represent the number of 1 and 0 contained in the ith column in D respectively. And c1D and c0D represent the number of 1 and 0 contained in the ith column of D? respectively. We use the formula below to reconstruct the support 1-item {i} in D:  '1 DD CMC ?=  (1)  ? ?  ? +??  ? +  =     pp p  pp p  M  ? ? ?  ?  ? ? ?  ? =  D  D D  c  c C   ? ? ?  ?  ? ? ?  ? =  '  ' 1'  D  D D  c  c C  So, Dc1 can be solved as follows:   '  '  '  1 pp ccpc  c DDD  D  ? +?  = ??  (2)   3.3 k-Itemset Support Reconstruction   Randomized Disturb technology proposed in the paper  is operated independently between each item, so we can extend the formula of support reconstruction of k-itemset.

Suppose I={il, i2, ?, ik} is a k-item sets?when all the items use the same random parameters? the probability mi,j represents k-itemset j in D changed into k-itemset i in D?.

Mk=[mi,j] is a matrix of 2k*2k. When Mk is invertible? ][1 ijk aM =  ? ?  '1 D k  D CMC ?= ?then the support of k-itemsets in D can be calculated as follows:   cacacac DDDD ' 12k1k2,1k2 '  11,1k2 '  00,1k212k ...

?????? +++=   The usual method computing Mk-1 which is used by  MASK is as follows: Firstly, we get Mk.. Next, we inverse Mk and get Mk-1. However,  1? kM satisfies the recursive  relationship. So, we don?t have to get Mk at all. We can get Mk-1 directly by M2-1.We use this method in this paper.

As we know, the orders of both Mk and Mk-1 are 2k. So the time complexity getting Mk is O(2k*2k). At present, the general method to get inverse matrix is Gauss algorithm.

And the time complexity of Gauss algorithm to get inverse matrix is O(23k). So the time complexity of the usual method to get Mk-1 is O(2k*2k)+ O(23k).However, the time complexity of the method to get Mk-1 proposed in this paper is only O(2k*2k). Obviously, the time complexity of the method proposed in this paper is better than that of MASK.

4.1 The Measure Standard of Privacy   The measurement of privacy preserving level is the quantitative information for user privacy protection degree of privacy preserving mining algorithm. Suppose a certain client U had bought commodity i, then the initial value of i is 1, and the probability can be reconstructed accurately from transformed data before mining. Suppose is  is the support level of item i, it means the probability of a random client buying item i is is . Suppose original item is Ui , the disturbed item with the corresponding components is Vi . It can be known from the total probability formula that the right probability of reconstructive initial value is:  ( ) ( )1|11|1)(1 ===== iiiii VUPUVPsR  ( ) ( )0|11|0 ====+ iiii VUPUVP   (5) It can be known from the definition of conditional probability?  )1( )11()1|1(  = =?====  i  ii ii  VP VUPVUP  )1( )1|1()1(  = ====  i  iii  VP UVPUP  )0|1()0()1|1()1(  ===+=== ?=  iiiiii  i  UVPUPUVPUP ps  There is:       )1( )1|1(  psps psVUP  ii  i ii  ??+? ?===   (6)  The same:  )1()1()1( )1()0|1(    psps psVUP  ii  i ii  ???+?? ??===   (7)  So:  ( ) i  i  ii  i i  sppp sp  spsp spSR  )(1 )1(  )1( 122     ?+?  ?+ +?  =   (8)   The total reconstruction probability of the item whose  original value is 1:  ? ?=  i i  i ii  s sRs  R )(1  (9)   When all the items in the database adopt the same support level, R1 is the minimum. As an estimate value, we use s0 instead of support level of each item, R1 is simplified as:         )(1 )1(  )1( sppp sp  spsp spR  ?+? ?+  +? =  (10)   Using the same way, the total reconstruction probability of the item which its original value is 0 can be derived:       )0   )(1 )1()1(  )1( 1(  sppp sp  spsp spR  ?+? ??+  +? ?=   (11)   The total reconstruction probability is:  01 )1( RRR ?? ?+=  (12)  where ? is the percent of the numbers of ?1? in 0-1 database.According to the definition of reconstruction probability, privacy can be simply defined as: P=(1-R)*100   4.2 The Measure Standard of Mining Accuracy  The target of privacy preserving association rules mining is allowing miner to discover the frequency sets within the accurate scope while protecting data privacy. However, the privacy protected technique of random perturbation uses probabilistic approach; in fact the value of reconstruction support can not be the same as the real value. This means that there is error in the support of the estimated frequency set, that is, larger or smaller than the actual support. The error of estimated support is more harmful than that of frequency set statistics support, for they can induce the error  of frequency set identification. So, the mining error of association rules can be measured according to two standards: support error and identity error.

Support Error ( ? ).f represents the set which was structured by the actual frequent item sets in reconstructed frequent item sets. It means the average errors between the estimated values and actual values of the item sets support degree in f. This standard influences the average relative errors of the reconstructed support degree. Defined as follow:    100* _  |___| |f|  1 ?= supact supactsuprec?  (13)   Identity Error (? ). R represents the set which was  structured by the reconstructed frequent item sets. F represents the set which was structured by the actual frequent item sets. It is used to measure the error degree of R, includes +( overestimation frequent item sets?means those are thought as the frequent itemsets by mistake.) and -(underestimation frequent itemsets, means those actual frequent itemsets which are not thought as frequent itemsets by mistake), defined as follow:  100* ||  |FR| F ?=+? 100*  || ||  F RF ?=??  (14)    5. Experiments and Results Analysis  In this section, we contrasted the performances of MASK algorithm and DDIL algorithm by experiments. We took the data privacy and the accuracy of mining results as measures of algorithm performance, and explained the relations between the data privacy, the accuracy of mining results and the random parameters.We used Synthetic Data Generator, which was developed by IBM Almaden Research Center, to produce transaction set D whose parameters were T10I4D100KN1K (T: Average length of transactions, I: Average length of frequent item set, D: Number of transactions, N: Number of items).

Due to space constraints, we analyzed the experimental results of the minimum degree of support of 0.3%.

Minimum support of 0.3% compared to a huge number of frequent itemsets is low enough, therefore it could reflect the performance of the algorithm DDIL.

Table 1 indicates the privacy of DDIL algorithm when p1, p2, p3 take different random numbers.

Fig.1 indicates the time consumed to compute M-1 by DDIL and MASK when minimum support-threshold takes 0.2 and p1= p=0.4.

Figure 1. Time Consumed to Compute M-1  The result of Table 1 indicates that when the DDIL algorithm's minimum support takes 0.3% and the combinations of p1, p2 and p3 take different values, the privacy is larger than 88%.

The result of Table 2 indicates that when the DDIL  algorithm's minimum support takes 0.3%, and the combinations of p1, p2 and p3 take different values, item set error and the support error of each mining results are very low.

The result of Figure 1 shows that the time efficiency of DDIL is much better than that of MASK.

However, there does not exist one kind of parameter combination which is superior in each aspect, it need to adjust according to the actual demand. When p1 is larger, the error rate is lower; when the value of p1 decreases gradually, the error rate will increase. When the degree of privacy-preserving increases, correspondingly, the error rate increases. Thus, how to achieve the balance between error rate and privacy needs a further discussion.

6. Conclusion  In view of the deficiencies of MASK algorithm, in this paper randomized response technology and association rule mining algorithm are integrated and a multi-parameters randomized disturb algorithm is proposed, which is called DDIL algorithm. When the data sets are processed with different random parameters, the original data can be disturbed and hidden, and the defects of using data disturb and data hiding strategy singly are solved, and the privacy-preserving degree of the algorithm is improved effectively. On this basis, the algorithm of generating frequent items from transformed data sets is proposed.

Finally, the experiments show that when the parameters are chosen suitably, all the privacy, accuracy and time efficiency of DDIL algorithm can satisfy people?s need.

At present, taking uniform disturbance probability to change data sets, the simplex of disturbance probability reduces the reveal of privacy. Therefore, to a different attribute can adopt different parameters according to its security classification in the future.
