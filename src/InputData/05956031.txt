Abstract - Association rule mining is based on the assumption that users can specify the minimum-support for  mining their databases. It has been identified that setting the minimum support is a difficult task to users. This can hamper the widespread applications of these algorithms. This paper proposes a method for computing minimum  supports for each item. It therefore will run the fuzzy multi-level mining algorithm for extracting knowledge implicit  in quantitative transactions, immediately. More specifically, our algorithms automatically generate actual minimum-  supports according to users? mining requirements. In order to address this need, the new approach can express tow  profits includes computing the minimum support for each item regarding to characteristic for each item in database  and making a system automation. We considered an algorithm that can cover the multiple level association rules  under multiple item supports. We experimentally examine the algorithms using a dataset, and demonstrate that our  algorithm fittingly approximates actual minimum-supports from the commonly-used requirements.
