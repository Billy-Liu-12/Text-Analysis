Abstract? Image mining deals with the extraction of image patterns from a large collection of images.  Clearly,  image  mining is different   from  low-level  computer  vision and image processing  techniques because the focus  of image mining is in extraction of patterns from large  collection  of images, whereas  the focus of computer  vision  and image  processing techniques  is  in  understanding  and  / or extracting  specific features from a single  image. While  there seems to be some overlaps between image mining and  content-based retrieval (both are dealing with large  collection of images), image mining goes beyond the  problem of retrieving relevant images. In image mining, the  goal is the discovery of image patterns that are significant  in a given collection of images.

I. INTRODUCTION  Image mining deals with extraction of implicit knowledge,  image data relationship or other patterns not explicitly stored  in images and uses ideas from computer vision, image  processing, image retrieval, data mining, machine learning,  databases and AI. The fundamental challenge in image mining  is to determine how low-level, pixel representation contained  in an image or an image sequence can be effectively and  efficiently processed to identify high-level spatial objects and  relationships. Typical image mining process involves pre-  processing, transformations and feature extraction, mining (to  discover significant patterns out of extracted features),  evaluation and interpretation and obtaining the final  knowledge. Various techniques from existing domains are  also applied to image mining and include object recognition,  learning, clustering and classification, just to name a few.

Association rule mining is a well-known data mining  technique that aims to find interesting patterns in very large  databases. Some preliminary work has been done to apply  association rule mining on sets of images to find interesting  patterns[4,5,7].
