Using Concept Maps as a Cross-Language Resource  Discovery Tool for Large Documents in Digital Libraries

ABSTRACT Project Gutenburg, the Million Book Project, the Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations, Amazon?s book search service, and the recently announced collaboration of Google and leading libraries, all aim to make available large numbers of book-length objects, in a variety of languages.

Traditional approaches to discovering a suitable book for a particular purpose have generally relied on catalog records, sometimes enhanced with abstracts. Full-text searching ? popular, e.g., with legal and government documents ? and passage retrieval techniques, suitable for encyclopedias and reference works, have not been adequately tested with large collections of large objects.

Figure 1: Automatically generated  We demonstrate an alternative approach, integrating visualization, text mining, and simple machine translation techniques.  We show how electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs), in both English  and Spanish, can be summarized as concept maps, according to three different design layouts: whole document maps, chapter- level maps, and table of contents-based maps.  Our initial experiments are in the computer science and industrial systems engineering fields.

Concept maps (see Figure 1) are ?graphical representations of knowledge that are comprised of concepts and the relationships between them? [4].  Concept maps allow students to acquire knowledge more quickly than usual [2].  However, concept maps have yet to be extensively researched as aids to knowledge discovery. Our demonstration will show how this can work, including for multi-lingual collections. We argue that 1) users can more quickly grasp the key ideas of a work from a concept map than from an abstract alone; 2) it is easier to automatically generate concept maps than good abstracts; and 3) it is easier to automatically translate concept maps than abstracts.

We have tested several methods of finding relations in the texts, such as association rules [1], t-scores, Pearson?s ? 2, Dice?s coefficient, and mutual information. Using part-of-speech information from MontyTagger [3], we can find noun phrases which appear as nodes in the maps.  Other parts-of-speech, usually verbs or prepositions, are used as the links between the nodes.  Our demonstration highlights these techniques.
