Learning Performance Assessment Approach Using Learning Portfolio for

Abstract  Learning performance assessment aims to  evaluate what learners learnt during the learning  process. In recent years, how to perform the learning  performance assessment is a critical issue in the  web-based learning field. The traditional summative  evaluation can be applied to evaluate the learning  performance both for the conventional classroom  learning and web-based learning. However, it only considers final learning outcomes without  considering the learning progress of learners. This  paper proposes a learning performance assessment  approach which combines four computational intelligence theories including grey relational  analysis, K-means clustering method, fuzzy  association rule mining and fuzzy inference to  perform this task based on the learning portfolio of individual learner. Experimental results indicate that  the evaluation result of proposed method is positive  relevance with those of summative assessment.

Namely, this method can help teachers to precisely perform the formative assessment for individual  learner utilizing only the learning portfolio in  web-based learning environment.

1. Introduction Gagn?s? research on the internal process of  learning indicated that the complete learning process  cannot occur without learning performance assessment  [1]. The learning performance evaluation instruments  could be classified as the summative assessment and  formative assessment. The summative evaluation is  performed after finishing an instruction unit or class,  but the formative assessment emphasizes the learning  process. Recently, the popular formative assessment  instrument utilizes the learning portfolio for learning  performance assessment. The learning portfolio can be  gathered when people learn in an e-learning system.

Carrieira?s study [2] proposed to monitor the users?  reading behaviors in order to infer their interest in  particular articles. The information of the learning  process is quite impossible to be completely gathered  by the traditional written examination method. Hence,  Rahkila?s study [3] proposed the idea of using the user  profiles with log data for the learning performance  assessment.

Knowledge discovery, whose objective is to  obtain useful knowledge from data stored in large  repositories. Data mining has been considered as an  appropriate method of knowledge discovery to  excavate the implicit information. In this study, the  proposed learning performance assessment approach  integrates four computational intelligence techniques  to evaluate the on-line learning behaviors. They  include the grey relational analysis [4][5], K-means  clustering algorithm [6], fuzzy association rule [7][8],  and fuzzy inference [9]. The four computational  intelligence techniques are employed to perform the  factor analysis for extracting the main factors of  effecting the learning performance, determine fuzzy  membership functions for the fuzzy association rule,  discover the fuzzy association rules related to the  learning performance assessment, and infer the  learning performance by the discovered fuzzy  association rules, respectively.

The proposed learning performance assessment  approach has been demonstrated its effectiveness for  the personalized e-learning system presented in our  previous study [10]. Experimental results show the  proposed learning assessment approach can correctly  evaluate learners? learning performance according to  their learning portfolios as well as help teachers to  save a lot of time for learning evaluation during  learning processes.

2. Problem description 2.1. Personalized e-learning system (PELS)  The personalized e-learning system (PELS)  based on the Item Response Theory, which includes  an off-line courseware modeling process, four  intelligent agents and four databases, is presented in  our previous study for adaptive courseware  recommendation [10]. In this paper, the features of  the PELS system are extended to include the learning  performance assessment agent in order to perform  learning performance evaluation using the gathered  learning portfolio for individual learner.

2.2. Learning portfolio in the user profile  database The formative assessment strongly emphasizes      the integration of ?what people learned? and ?how  people learned?. The formative assessment occurs  when teachers feed information back to students in  ways that enable the student to learn better, or when  students can engage in a self-reflective process.

Hence, to grade the learning performance based on  the learning portfolio contains learners? learning  processes on e-learning platforms. Table 1 presents  those inclusive learning factors gathered by PELS.

Learning performance assessment  approach based on learning portfolio 3.1. Flowchart of learning performance  assessment Figure 1 reveals the entire flowchart of the  proposed learning performance assessment approach.

In the beginning, the grey relational analysis is first  applied to perform learning factor analysis, and then  K-means clustering algorithm is employed to  logically determine fuzzy membership function based  on data distribution for discovering fuzzy association  rules. After the fuzzy rules for learning performance  assessment are discovered, the fuzzy inference is  used to grade learning performance for learners. The  following sections will give details for the proposed  learning performance assessment approach.

3.2. Learning factor analysis using the grey  relational analysis Learning factor analysis is a vital process for the  proposed learning performance assessment approach  because it can filter out the irrelevant factors with the  learning performance from the learning portfolio to  promote the efficiency of learning evaluation.

Professor Deng Julong proposed the grey relational  analysis (GRA) which can rank the relational degree  for numerous sub-factors with the main factor  according to the grey relational grade [4][5]. The  importance of single data sequence could be explored  by the grey relational grade. The mathematics model  of grey relational analysis is described as the  following steps:  Step 1: Determining the referred and comparative  sequences  To employ GRA for factor analysis, the prior step  is the referred sequence 0I  and comparative  sequence iI  must be first determined. Grey  relational grade will be a large value if both the  referred sequence and comparative sequence  mutually resemble in the geometric curve. The  notations for the referred sequence 0I  and  comparative sequence iI  can be respectively  represented as follows:  = =  ))(),...,2(),1((  ))(),...,2(),1((  kIIII  kIIII  iiii  (1)  where 0I represents the referred sequence,  iI  is the  comparative sequence, and Zk ? .

Step 2: Grey generation  Before continuing the GRA, the comparability  among data sequences should be satisfied. Otherwise,  data sequences must be transformed through the grey  generation. To satisfy the comparability, the  larger-the-better transformation [5] is adopted and  formulated as follows:  )]}(min[)](max[  )](min[)( )(  )0()0(  )0()0(  *  kIkI  kIkI kI  ii  ii  i ?  ? =   (2)  where )](max[ )0(  kIi  denotes the maximum value of  the original sequence, )( )0(  kIi  represents the thk ?  data of the original sequence i , and )( *  kIi  is the  generated sequence.

Step 3: Calculating the grey relational grade  Let )I,I( i0? denote the evaluation value of grey relational grade between the data sequence 0I  and  iI , then the mathematical formula of the grey  relational grade can be formulated as follows:  =  = n  k  ii ))k(I),k(I( n  )I,I(   1 ??           (3)  where  max  maxmin  )( ))(),((  ?+? ?+?= ?  ?? k  kIkI oi  i ,  )()(maxmaxmax kIkI io ki  ?=? ??  ,      )()(min minmin kIkI io ki  ?=? ??  ,  )()()( kIkIk iooi  ?=? , and ?  is the distinguished coefficient.

The distinguished coefficient is usually set as 0.5.

It can be adjusted to satisfy various problems. A large  value of )I,I( i0?  stands for a higher grey relational  grade between the referred sequence ( 0I  ) and  comparative one ( iI ).

The flowchart of learning performance  assessment  3.3. Determining fuzzy membership function  for fuzzy association rule mining In this study, the fuzzy association rule is  employed to explore the fuzzy knowledge rules from  the learning portfolio for learning performance  assessment. Generally, the fuzzy association rule only  considers so-called large itemsets for fuzzy  association rule mining. In order to find out the large  itemsets for the fuzzy association rule mining, the  transaction data with quantitative value must be first  transformed into fuzzy degrees. To logically  determine fuzzy membership functions, the K-means  clustering algorithm [6] is applied to automatically  determine the centers of triangle fuzzy membership  functions for the fuzzy association rule mining  herein.

3.4. Fuzzy association rule mining Let I  be a set of items and T  be a set of  transactions with items in I . Association rules is  regarded as a method of data mining to clarify large  itemsets and presented as the form YX , where  ?=???? YX,Y,X,IY,X . The rule YX , Boolean association rule, means that most part of  transaction set of T that simultaneously contains both  the X  item and Y  item [6]. In contrast with  Boolean association rules, Hong?s study [8] proposed  the fuzzy association rule to overcome the defect in  the Boolean association rule for handling the  quantative transaction data. In a fuzzy association  rule YX , where X  and Y  are linguistic  terms. To judge a fuzzy association rule whether is  strong or not, two conditions must be deliberated.

First, the support and confidence respectively have to  satisfy the threshold, i.e. minimum support and  minimum confidence [6]. Second, the certainty factor  is used to evaluate the dependency between  antecedent and consequent [7]. To discover the fuzzy  knowledge rules related to the learning performance  from learning portfolio, the fuzzy association rule  presented in [7] is employed to perform this task  herein.

3.5. Fuzzy inference for learning performance  assessment This section describes how to infer the learning  performance according to the discovered fuzzy  association rules by fuzzy inference process. The  discovered fuzzy production rules have the form of  IF-THEN rules shown as follows: BYTHENAXandAXIF === 2211  where iX  and Y  are linguistic variables, iA  and  B  are linguistic terms.

A defuzzification strategy aims to transform the  outcome of fuzzy inference into crisp value. The  center of gravity (COG) [9], which is one method of  defuzzification methods, computes the crisp value  COGZ  from the most typical values and respective  degrees of membership function. Therefore, the  defuzzification method of center of gravity is used to  obtain the crisp value of learner?s learning  performance, and the mathematical formula is shown  as follows:  =  == n  j jz  n  j jjz  COG  z  zz z    )(  )(  ?  ? (4)  where n  is the number of quantization levels of the  output, j  z  is the amount of conttrol output at the  quantization level j , and )( jz  z?  represents its membership value in the output fuzzy set Z .

4. Experiments  To verify the quality of the discovered fuzzy association rules for the learner performance  assessment, some university students who have  majored in the course of C language programming  were invited to test this system. The experimental  results are described as follows.

4.1. The learning portfolio gathered by PELS In our experiment, six learning factors listed in  Table 1, which is supposed to be relevant with the      learning performance, are performed factor analysis  by GRA. Herein, the learning factor G is regarded as  referred sequence 0I and the other learning factors  {RA, DD, UD, LA, RT} are comparative sequences iI .

Table 2 illustrates a partial learning portfolio in the  user profile database gathered by PELS.

Learning factor analysis Table 3 illustrates the grey relational grades  between the referred sequence with various  comparative sequences. To observe the results, we  find that the five considered learning factors are  highly relevant with the final testing score due to the  grey relational grades are over the threshold 0.5. Thus,  the five learning factors will be preserved to perform  the fuzzy association rule mining in order to discover  useful fuzzy rules for learning performance  assessment.

Fuzzy membership function determined  by K-means clustering algorithm Since those quantitative transactions listed in  Table 2 must be transferred into fuzzy transactions  for fuzzy association rule mining, the K-means  clustering algorithm is employed to perform  clustering task and further logically determine the  optimal membership function. After performing the  clustering procedure, each learning factor can be  clustered as appropriate groups according to its data  distribution. Figure 2 shows an example of fuzzy  membership function automatically determined by  K-means clustering algorithm for the learning factor  G.

The discovered fuzzy rules for learning  performance assessment To explain the discovered fuzzy association  rules for learning performance assessment, the  simplified representation notations of the linguistic  variables are listed in Tables 4. Table 5 illustrates the  fuzzy rules discovered by the proposed learning  performance assessment approach that can evaluate  learners? learning performance for learners with high  testing score. To judge the discovered fuzzy rules whether is strong or not, two conditions that include  the minimum support and minimum confidence are  first deliberated. Besides, to ensure that the  discovered rules are interesting and accurate, the certainty factor is further employed to identify the  discovered fuzzy rules in this study. Table 6 lists the  assigned threshold for fuzzy association rule mining  task. From the discovered fuzzy rules listed in Table 5, we find that rule 1 has negative value of certainty  factor. Therefore, we filter out this rule to obtain the  verified fuzzy rules listed in Table 7 for learners with  high testing score.

4.5. Learning performance assessment by  fuzzy inference In this section, we give an example of learning  portfolio listed in Table 8 to demonstrate whether the discovered fuzzy rules can correctly evaluate the  learning performance based on learning portfolio or  not. Table 8 shows the grade of the final test of the  learner with STUD. No. 11373 is 50. Next, the discovered fuzzy rules listed in Table 7 are applied to  infer the grade of the final test for the learner with  STUD. No. 11373 according to the learning factors  RA, DD, UD, LA, and RT. The fuzzy inference  process and the defuzzification method of center of  gravity are used to evaluate the learning performance  for the learner with STUD. No. 11373, and the final  grade is calculated as follows:  =  == n  j  jz  n  j  jjG  COG  )I(  I)I(  Grade      ?  ?       0.010.110.260.410.560.710.870.970.690.400.12  0.01*840.01*840.11*800.26*750.41*700.56*650.71600.87550.97500.69450.40400.1235  =  ++++++++++ ++++++?+?+?+?+?+?  =  To compare with the grade of final test, the  evaluation result is very close to the grade of the final  test. In another word, the proposed method can help  teachers to precisely perform the formative  assessment for individual learner under only utilizing  the learning portfolio in web-based learning  environment.

5. Conclusion In this study, an effective learning performance  assessment approach is presented to help teacher to  precisely perform formative assessment for  individual learner under only utilizing the learning  portfolio in web-based learning environment. The  inferred learning performance can be served as a  reference guide to teachers as well as be regarded as a  learning feedback to learners. By such a feedback  mechanism, learners can understand his current  learning status and make appropriate learning  adjustment. Meanwhile, teachers could devote  themselves to teaching work due to saving a lot of  time for learning evaluation.
