Writing On Plaid Paper R. Bruce MacLeod

Abstract?This paper concerns the adaptive coding of digital data transmissions in complicated interfering environments.

The contribution made here is to extend the popular dirty paper concept to include interference environments that are only partially known in structure to the transmitter. The adaptations we describe happen at the PHY layer of a protocol stack, rather than the higher layer adaptations which dominate the literature.
