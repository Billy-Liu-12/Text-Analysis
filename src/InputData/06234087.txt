Abstract?Fuzzy association rules (FAR) are well suited for the thinking of human subject and will help to increase the flexibility for supporting user in making decisions or designing the fuzzy systems. The classic extraction of associative rules suffers from a high number of generated rules. To overcome this problem, several studies have been developed to extract a generic subset of all rules. These generic databases are particularly suitable for dense contexts. The fuzzy contexts are highly dense contexts. So it is necessary to define a generic basis for all FAR. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for extracting FAR based on the extraction of generic basis of these last. This generic basis constitutes a compact nucleus of FAR which is based on the extraction of fuzzy closed itemsets and their corresponding fuzzy minimal generators.

I.  INTRODUCTION Data mining is the set of techniques to intelligently interpret  the information available in database in order to achieve operational knowledge. This knowledge will be used for applications related to several areas such as management, production control, market research, e-commerce.

The techniques and tools for extracting knowledge from some traditional certain contexts have developed each time more effectively.

However, they appear to be unsuitable for mining real contexts containing quantitative attributes as they generate for users knowledge with prohibitive size. To overcome this problem, some introduced the theory of fuzzy set to extract fuzzy association rules (FAR).

There are very appealing from a knowledge representational point of view. The idea of fuzzy sets is to act as an interface between a numerical scale and a symbolic scale which is usually composed of linguistic terms. Thus, the rules discovered in a database might be presented in a linguistic and hence comprehensible and user-friendly way.

Moving from set-based to fuzzy associations is formally accomplished by replacing sets by fuzzy sets. While the formal specification of fuzzy associations is hence more or less straightforward, the evaluation of fuzzy associations through appropriate quality measures, notably the well-known support and confidence measures is more intricate. Especially, it assumes an understanding of the semantics of a fuzzy rule.

In this paper, we focus on the extraction of FAR from quantitative data. In addition, we propose to extract generic bases of AR, in which appear in premise and conclusion fuzzy properties, based on Fuzzy Closed Itemsets (FCI) and their Fuzzy Minimal Generators (FMG).

This generic basis of FAR is particularly suitable for dense environments. The fuzzy contexts are highly dense environments. So it is necessary to define a generic basis for all FAR.

The results of our research are summarized in this article which is composed of three parts. In section 2, we present quantitative approaches for extraction FAR. In section 3, we present a new algorithm for extracting FAR based on the extraction of FCI that will be used to extract a generic basis of FAR. Section 4 evaluates the extracted generic basis of FAR.

Finally, section 5 concludes the paper and gives future work.



II. MINING FUZZY ASSOCIATION RULES: QANTITATIVE APPROACHES  Based on classical association rule mining, a new approach has been developed expanding it by using fuzzy sets. Mining FAR approaches emerged out of the necessity to mine quantitative data frequently present in databases efficiently.

Kuok et al. [1] describe fuzzy association rules as follows: ?Mining fuzzy association rule is the discovery of association rules using fuzzy set concepts such that the quantitative attribute can be handled? As in classical association rules,  { }miiiI ,...,, 21= represents all the attributes appearing in the transaction database { }ntttT ,...,, 21= . I   contains all the possible items of a database, different combinations of those items are called itemsets. Each attribute ki  will associate with several fuzzy sets. In order to represent the fuzzy sets associated with ki , we use the notion { }iklikikik fffF ,...,, 21= where  ikjf is the thj  fuzzy set in ikF  .

For example, the attribute age could look as follows: { }OldAdultYoungChildFage ,,,=  .

Fuzzy sets and their corresponding membership functions have to be defined by domain experts. Each of the fuzzy sets can be viewed as a [0,1] valued attribute, called fuzzy attribute.

A fuzzy association rule has the following form: BisYthenAisXif .

In this case, { }pxxxX ,...,, 21=  and { }qyyyY ,...,, 21= vare itemsets which are subsets of I . It is important to notice that those two sets must be disjoint and thus do not have any attributes in common. { }xpxx fffA ,...,, 21=  and { }yqyy fffB ,...,, 21= contain the fuzzy sets that are associated with X and Y  .

AisX is the condition; BisY  is the consequent. If a sufficient amount of records approves this rule, we will call it satisfied.

When we are dealing with quantitative attributes mapped to fuzzy sets we might, depending on the membership function, find that the membership values to the sets of one single entity does not add up to one [2]. This depends on how we defined our fuzzy sets and the corresponding membership functions in advance.

If we are dealing with a mix of quantitative and categorical attributes, we might find it unreasonable that the quantitative attribute has the potential to contribute to a rule more than a categorical one.

Table I presents Quantitative attribute without fuzzy normalization.

TABLE I.  QUANTITATIVE ATTRIBUTE WITHOUT FUZZY NORMALIZATION  Level:Junior Level:Senior Age:Young Age:Adult Age:Old 0 1 0.2 0.8 0.1  The categorical attribute Level can have any number of attributes, and still only one of them will contribute with the value 1 and the others will show 0.

The quantitative attribute Age represented by fuzzy sets, however, in this case it contributes with 1.1. It is unreasonable for one transaction to contribute more than others. Here, the fuzzy normalization process takes place. It will further transform the transaction to values of age that sum up to 1. The new values can be calculated easily by dividing the value of a single element by the sum of all the fuzzy values corresponding to that attribute.

Table II presents quantitative attribute with fuzzy normalization.

III. EXTRACT-FAR: AN ALGORITHM FOR MINING FAR In this section, we present an algorithm for extraction FAR.

We test it by an example.

The terminologies used by the algorithm Extract-FCI are:  ? ( )RIOK ~,~,=  : Formal fuzzy formal context.

? FMG : set of fuzzy minimal generators.

? kFMG : set of fuzzy minimal k-generators.

? FIG  : Fuzzy Intermediate Generator ? FCI : set of all Fuzzy Closed Itemsets.

? MinSup : The minimal support.

A. Calculation of Fuzzy Operations Calculating the support and confidence are important for  generating the FCI and FAR.

For all rules:  1 2:R I I? : 1 2| ( ) |( )  | | g I ISupp R  o ?=      (1) 1 2   | ( ) |( ) | ( ) |  g I IConf R g I  ?=     The extraction FCI algorithm uses  two procedures using the operators of correspondence of fuzzy Galois latticewhich are Calcul-Domain()  and Closure().

Calcul-Domain() function (line 4) will determine the respective domain of the elements of this set. This function is used to apply the operator g~ of the correspondence of fuzzy Galois generator for each FIG .

It comes to applying the operator f~ of the correspondence of fuzzy Galois on FMG domains.

It is an iterative algorithm adopting the strategy ?Test-and-generate? for the Exploration of the search space. At each level k , a set of FMG  of size k  is generated from those used during the iteration ( )1?k and their respective domain. The domain of these generators will be used to construct the set of FCI . The pseudo-code of the algorithm  FCIExtract ? is presented by Figure 1.

Extract- FCI: An Extraction algorithm of Fuzzy Closed Itemsets  To illustrate the progress of Extract-FCI, we will apply our test database. It consists of food consumption by customers of different ages. It?s given by Table III.

The client ID which is a numeric attribute,  ? The age is an uncertain information, which may be child (1-15 years), young (15 to 30 years), adult (30-45 years) or old (more than 45 years)  ? And the food: sugar, dairy and lipid which are also uncertain information identified by their amount of consumption that can be say low, medium, high and excessive.

To simplify the representation of the example, we will reformulate the attributes of our table which are the clusters by simple identifiers. The following correspondence between attribute and identifier will be used (see Tabe IV):  TABLE IV.

Extraction of generic basic of FAR (GFAR) The generic basic of fuzzy associative rules ( GFAR ).is  defined as follows:  ( ){ }IiFMGiFCIIiIiRGFAR I ~~~~~~~:~ ???????=  (4) For all rules ( )iIiR ~~~:~ ?? included in GFAR , the fuzzy  itemset i~  is a minimal generator of the FCI  I~  so if ( ) ( ) IIgfigf ~~~~~~~ == ( i~ and I~  belong to the same  equivalence class).

Therefore, i~ and I~  have the same value of support and as  a result the confidence of  ( )( )iSupport ISupportR ~ ~~ =  is equal to 1.

The condition Ii ~~ ? ( ) ( )( )iigf ~~~~ ?  is necessary because the FAR generated from a fuzzy generator i~ of fuzzy closed itemset  I~  such as Ii ~~ = are in the form of ??i~  and do not belong to all set of valid rules (rule not informative).

IV. EVALUATION OF GENERATED FAR To evaluate our work, we presented some association rules  generated from the GFAR . The generated rules have a confidence equal to 1. We evaluate these rules according to some quality criteria.

Assessing the value of a rule can be measured according to the high number of examples of the rule or by the low number of its anti-examples [7].

C1  If abn = abn   then this rule has as much of example  than anti-example. therefore abn = a2 n  If abn < a2 n  then this rule has more examples of the  form BA ? .

If abn > a2 n  then this rule has more anti-examples of  the form BA ? .

The interesting rules take a positive value for quality measures. According to Piatetstky-Shapiro [8], a good measure ? quality of the rule BA ?  should be:  C2 ?( A B? ) < 0 in the case of repulsion between the  premise and the conclusion of a rule, ( )bp a bp ?? ? ?  ? ? ? .

C3 ?( A B? ) = 0 in case of independence between the  premise and the conclusion of a rule ( )bp a bp =? ? ?  ? ? ? .

C4 ?( A B? ) > 0 in case of attraction between the premise  and the conclusion of a rule ( )bp a bp ? ? ?  ? ? ? .

To do this, we calculate, for each rule, the following  parameters an , bn , abn , ban  and ?? ?  ? ? ?  a bp .

R1 an = 2   bn = 5     C1 ab  n = abn = 1, then this rule has more examples than abn = 1 anti - examples.

abn = 1   abn = 1       C3 ( )bpa  bp =? ? ?  ? ? ? , then ( )BA ??  = 0 So  independence between the premise and the conclusion of the rule.

2b  p =    R2  an = 2   bn = 2      C1 abn = 0 < a  n = 1, then the rule has  just example and has no anti- example because abn = 0.

abn = 2   abn = 0  5b  p =  ? ? ?  ? ? ?  a bp =1   C4 ( )bpa  bp ? ? ?  ? ? ? , then ( )BA ?? > 0. So  attraction between the premise and the conclusion of the rule.



V.  CONCLUSION   A classic problem of data mining is the search for association rules through databases of sales transactions. Each transaction consists of a list of items purchased to identify the most popular items groups together.

At first, this technique is used to analyze the basket, and then it has spread to include all areas that seek to group products and services.

In this paper we have proposed a new method for extracting FAR. This method is based on the extraction of FCI that will be used to extract a generic basis of FAR.

The extracted generic FAR is particularly suitable for dense contexts.

To evaluate the generated rules, we have used sensitivity to the appearance of anti-examples and the baseline quality measures.

As future work, we propose to:  ? Explore the possibility of reducing the number of fuzzy minimal generators introducing the concept of succinct generators, and  ? To interpret and assess the FAR.
