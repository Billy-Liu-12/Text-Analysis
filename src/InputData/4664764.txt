A Finite Ranked Poset and its Application in Visualization of Association Rules

Abstract  We discuss the set of all Boolean association rules.

By defining special partial order on the set, we get an isomorphism between the set and a special finite ranked poset. Through discussing some basic properties of the fi- nite ranked poset, we can clearly represent the hierarchical structure of all Boolean association rules. Meanwhile, the Hasse diagram of the poset offers a visualization view of the structure.

1. Introduction  Data mining, also known as knowledge discovery in databases, has been recognized as a new very active re- search frontier of intelligent information processing. It has successful applications in many areas. Discovering associ- ation rules [1, 2] is one of the most attractive research sub- jects of data mining. Since the term association rule was first introduced by R.Agrawal et al. in 1993, the problem of mining association rules from large databases has been the subject of numerous studies. Some of them focus on de- veloping faster algorithms for the classical method and/or adapting the algorithms to various situations. Another di- rection is to define rules that modify some conditions of the classical rules to adapt to new applications. In [6], we proposed a generalized association rules model called weak ratio rules. Given minimum support threshold ms and minimum confidence threshold mc, an important subset of weak ratio rules is just an ideal [4] of a direct product of finite finite-chains. Through investigating the structure of the direct product of finite finite-chains, and the set of all Boolean association rules, we come to that a special poset called finite ranked poset can clearly represent the hierar- chical structure of all quasi-maximal weak ratio rules, all frequent itemsets and all Boolean association rules.

In Section 2, we introduce the concept finite ranked poset, a special finite ranked poset ?m, and discuss some important properties of them. In Section 3, we prove that  the structure of all Boolean association rules is isomorphic with that of ?m under a special given binary relation. So, the Hasse diagram of ?m offers a visualization view of all Boolean association rules. In Section 4, we summarizes our study and points out some future research issues.

2. Finite ranked poset  In this section, we will present some basic concepts and results about finite ranked posets and their Cartesian prod- uct.

2.1. Some basic definitions  Let P be a partially ordered set (briefly, poset) with the partial order ?. For and x, y ? P , we use the expression x < y to mean x ? y but x ?= y. We use the expression x ? y to mean x < y and whenever x ? z ? y it follows that x = z or z = y. A subset I of P is an ideal [4] if the conditions x ? I and y ? x imply y ? I . An element b of B ? P is called a maximal element of B if there is no element c in B such that b < c. Obviously, an ideal can be determined uniquely by its maximal elements and vice versa.

A poset P is called a finite ranked poset, called FRP briefly in this paper, if P is a finite poset, and there exists a function r from P to the set of natural number N (r : P ?? N), satisfying the following conditions:  (1). minx?P r(x) = 0; (2). x ? y ? r(x) + 1 = r(y).

Then we say that r is a rank function[7, 4] of P . rP ? maxx?P r(x), which is called rank[3, 4] of P . ?k ? {0, 1, ? ? ? , rP },  Lk(P ) ? {? ? P |r(?) = k},  we say that Lk(P ), or Lk for short, is k-th level[3, 4] of P .

Proposition 2.1 [3, 4] A Cartesian product P of finite ranked posets P1, P2, ? ? ? , Pm is also a finite ranked poset;    and if ri is the rank function of Pi(i = 1, 2, ? ? ? ,m), then r : P ?? N, r(?x1, x2, ? ? ? , xm?) =  m? i=1  ri(xi) is the rank  function of P .

Proposition 2.2 Let Vi = ? ? {xy|x, y ? {0, 1}, x ? y = 0} = {00, 01, 10},i = 1, 2, ? ? ? ,m, the partial order  ?i=??? {?00, 01?, ?10, 01?, ?00, 00?, ?01, 01?, ?10, 10?},  then the Cartesian product V of V1, V2, ? ? ? , Vm has unique ranked function, and  (1). rV = m; (2). ?k = 0, 1, ? ? ? , rV , Lk = {?x1y1, x2y2, ? ? ? ,  xmym?|?i = 1, 2, ? ? ? ,m, xiyi ? ?, m?  i=1  yi = k}; (3). Let ? = ?x1y1, x2y2, ? ? ? , xmym?, ? = ?s1t1,  s2t2, ? ? ? , smtm? ? V , then ? ? ? ? ?i0 ? {1, 2, ? ? ? ,m} such that yi0 = 0, si0ti0 = 01, and ?i ? {1, 2, ? ? ? ,m} \ {i0}, xiyi = siti.

Remark 2.1 From the Hasse diagram of FRP ? in Propo- sition 2.2, shown in Fig. 1(a), and that of the spider poset Q(1, 1) in [4], shown in Fig. 1(b), we know that ? is iso- morphic with Q(1, 1).

Finit ranked poset ?m  In this section, the FRP V in Proposition 2.2 is denoted by ?m, and the element ?x1y1, x2y2, ? ? ? , xmym? in ?m also be denoted by  ( x1 x2 ? ? ? xm y1 y2 ? ? ? ym  ) . By Proposition  2.2, for any k ? {0, 1, ? ? ? ,m},  |Lk| = Ckm2m?k,  |?m| = m?  k=0  |Lk| = m?  k=0  Ckm2 m?k = 3m.

The Hasse diagram of ?3  In ?m, we also discuss two partial orders. One is the product partial order ?, which is default, defined as  ? ? ? if and only if ?(i) ? ?(i) for any i = 1, 2, ? ? ? ,m, the other is the total order ?l defined as(  x1 x2 ? ? ? xm y1 y2 ? ? ? ym  ) ?l  ( a1 a2 ? ? ? am b1 b2 ? ? ? bm  ) if and  only if  (1).

m?  i=1  yi < m?  i=1  bi, or  (2).

m?  i=1  yi = m?  i=1  bi and ?y1, y2, ? ? ? , ym? <l ?b1, b2, ? ? ? , bm?, or  (3). ?y1, y2, ? ? ? , ym? = ?b1, b2, ? ? ? , bm? and ?x1, x2, ? ? ? , xm? ?l ?a1, a2, ? ? ? , am?, where ?l in (3) is usual lexicographic order, <l in (2) means ?l and ?=.

?m with ? is a FRP. In its Hasse diagram, elements in the same level are usually arranged from left to right ac- cording to the total order ?l.

3. Structure of Boolean association rules set  3.1. An isomorphism  Let D be a set of transactions, and I = {i1, i2, ? ? ? , im} be the set of all items [2]. Let ?(I) denote the following set:  ?(I) ? {?X,Y ?|X,Y ? I,X ? Y = ?}.

The element ?X,Y ? in ?(I) is also denoted by (X ? Y ) or  ( X Y  ) .

Define binary relation ? in ?(I) as follows: ?X2, Y2? ? ?X1, Y1? if and only if Y2 ? Y1 and  X1 ? X2 ? X1 ? (Y1 \ Y2).

The intuitive meaning of ?X2, Y2? ? ?X1, Y1? is that    ?X1, Y1? becomes ?X2, Y2? after a part of Y1 is transferred to X1 or lost.

Proposition 3.1 ??(I),?? is a poset.

Proof. We only prove the transitivity: If ?X3, Y3? ? ?X2, Y2? ? ?X1, Y1?, then Y2 ? Y1, X1 ? X2 ? X1 ? (Y1 \Y2), Y3 ? Y2 and X2 ? X3 ? X2? (Y2 \Y3). Hence, Y3 ? Y2 ? Y1, X1 ? X2 ? X3, X3 ? X2 ? (Y2 \ Y3) ? X1 ? (Y1 \ Y2) ? (Y2 \ Y3) = X1 ? (Y1 \ Y3), Therefore, ?X3, Y3? ? ?X1, Y1?. ?  In the following, if there is no specification, the partial order on ?(I) is always ?.

Proposition 3.2 Define mapping  ? : ?(I) ?? ?m( X Y  ) ???  ( ?X(i1) ?X(i2) ? ? ? ?X(im) ?Y (i1) ?Y (i2) ? ? ? ?Y (im)  ) ,  then ? is a isomorphism. i.e., ? is a bijection and ??, ? ? ?(I),  ? ? ? if and only if ?(?) ? ?(?).

Hence, ?(I) is a FRP, and its Hasse diagram is isomorphic to that of ?m.

Proof. Obviously, ? is a bijection. We only need to prove  that ?? = (  X2 Y2  ) , ? =  ( X1 Y1  ) ? ?(I),  ? ? ? if and only if ?(?) ? ?(?).

Firstly, if  ( X2 Y2  ) ?  ( X1 Y1  ) , we prove  ( ?X2(i1) ?X2(i2) ? ? ? ?X2(im) ?Y2(i1) ?Y2(i2) ? ? ? ?Y2(im)  )  ? (  ?X1(i1) ?X1(i2) ? ? ? ?X1(im) ?Y1(i1) ?Y1(i2) ? ? ? ?Y1(im)  ) ,  that is, ?i ? I , (  X2(i) Y2(i)  ) ?  ( X1(i) Y1(i)  ) . Consider the fol-  lowing three cases:  (1). If  ( X1(i) Y1(i)  ) =  (  ) , the conclusion is obvious.

(2). If  ( X1(i) Y1(i)  ) =  (  ) , then i ? X1 and i /? Y1, hence  i ? X2 and i ?= Y2, (  X2(i) Y2(i)  ) =  (  ) =  ( X1(i) Y1(i)  ) , the  conclusion is true.

(3). If  ( X1(i) Y1(i)  ) =  (  ) , then i /? X1 and i /? Y1. Since  X2 ? X1 ? (Y1 \ Y2), we get i /? X2. Since Y2 ? Y1, we get i /? Y2. Therefore,  ( X2(i) Y2(i)  ) =  (  ) ?  ( X1(i) Y1(i)  ) , the  conclusion is true.

Secondly, if ?(?) ? ?(?), we prove (  X2 Y2  ) ?  ( X1 Y1  ) .

?i ? Y2, we have i /? X2, (  X2(i) Y2(i)  ) =  (  ) . Since(  X2(i) Y2(i)  ) ?  ( X1(i) Y1(i)  ) , we get  ( X1(i) Y1(i)  ) =  (  ) . It fol-  lows that i ? Y1. Therefore, Y2 ? Y1.

?i ? X1, we have  ( X1(i) Y1(i)  ) =  (  ) , hence  ( X2(i) Y2(i)  ) =(   ) . It follows that i ? X2. Therefore, X1 ? X2.

?i ? X2, we prove i ? X1 ? (Y1 \ Y2). Since i /? Y2,  (  ) =  ( X2(i) Y2(i)  ) ?  ( X1(i) Y1(i)  ) , so  ( X1(i) Y1(i)  ) =  (  )  or  (  ) . When  ( X1(i) Y1(i)  ) =  (  ) , we get i ? X1, when(  X1(i) Y1(i)  ) =  (  ) , we get i ? Y1 \ Y2. i ? X1 ? (Y1 \ Y2)  is true. This means that X2 ? X1 ? (Y1 \ Y2).

By the definition of partial order on ?(I), we get(  X2 Y2  ) ?  ( X1 Y1  ) . ?  3.2. Maximal Boolean association rules  Given minimum support threshold ms and minimum confidence threshold mc, the set R of all Boolean associa- tion rules is that {(X ? Y )|X,Y ? I,X ?Y = ?,X, Y ?= ?, sup(X ? Y ) ? ms, conf(X ? Y ) ? mc}.

Obviously, R is a subset of ?(I). By properties of Boolean association rules and the partial order on ?(I), we know that R is an ideal of ?(I) \ L0(?(I)). For conve- nience, Boolean association rule is simply denoted by BAR.

A maximal element of R is called a maximal BAR.

The concept maximal BAR is just the concept atom as- sociation rule in [8]. The set of all maximal BARs is just the least set of rules in [9].

If we allow the consequent of a BAR to be empty, then ?X ? I ,  X is a frequent itemset if and only if (X ? ?) is BAR.

In the viewpoint, R is an ideal of ?(I).

If there is k(k ? 0) elements in the consequent of a  BAR, then the BAR is called a k-BAR. We use Rk to denote the set of all k-BARs, then Rk = R ? Lk(?(I)), i.e., Rk is the k-th level of R. R0 is just the set of all frequent itemsets.

R1 is just the set of all SAR [5], i.e., the set of all association rules in [1].

3.3. An Example  Let D be the transactional database in Table 1.

Table 1. Transactional database TID Items t1 c t2 a, b, c t3 a, b, c t4 b t5 c  Suppose ms = 0.2,mc = 0.8, then the Boolean associ- ation rules set R = {(bc ? a), (a ? b), (ac ? b), (a ? c), (ab ? c), (a ? bc)}.

If we allow the consequent of a BAR to be empty, then (a ? ?), (b ? ?), (c ? ?), (ab ? ?), (ac ? ?), (bc ? ?), (abc ? ?) are also BARs, and there are four maximal BARs: (b ? ?), (c ? ?), (bc ? a) and (a ? bc). The Hasse diagram of ?(I) and the ideal R are shown in Fig. 3.

abc  ab ab  c  ac ac  b  bc bc  a  a a  b  a  c  a  bc  b b  a  b  c  b  ac  c c  a  c  b  c  ab  a b c ab ac bc abc  Figure 3. Structure of BARs  The four bold nodes( a bc  ) ,  ( bc a  ) ,  ( b ? )  ,  ( c ? )  are the four maximal BARs. The bold lines, the nodes con- nected by the bold lines and the four bold nodes constitute the Hasse diagram of all association rules. The seven 0- BARs(  a ? )  ,  ( b ? )  ,  ( c ? )  ,  ( ab ?  ) ,  ( ac ?  ) ,  ( bc ?  ) ,  ( abc ?  )  correspond the seven frequent itemsets {a}, {b}, {c}, {a, b}, {a, c}, {b, c} and {a, b, c}. In the 1-th level, there are five 1-BARs(  bc a  ) ,  ( a b  ) ,  ( ac b  ) ,  ( a c  ) ,  ( ab c  ) .

In the 2-th level, there is only one 2-BAR (  a bc  ) .

4. Conclusion  In this paper, what we are concerned about is not as- sociation rule mining algorithms but the mining result, the structure of all association rules, the Hasse diagram visu- alization of the structure. By theory analysis and example, we can use finite ranked poset ?m and its Hasse diagram to study the structure of all association rules. Since ?m is a Macaulay poset, we can discuss the Macaulay properties of the set of all association rules. Meanwhile, like the Hasse diagram visualization of concept lattice based on the theory of formal concept analysis, we can collect some association rule nodes which have some similar relations or properties as a new virtual node, and then discuss relation of those vir- tual nodes in a new more concise Hasse diagram.
