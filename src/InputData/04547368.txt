Abstract- There is a strong relation between the size, the shape and the location of the illuminated part of a shallow-junction photodiode, and its series resistance 12, 3, 41. This relation creates an expectation for a big variation of the response time (the time for which the photo-generated charge will be removed from the photodiode) with the illuminated spot size. This is because the time constant of the photodiode, which is one of the main factors defining the response time, is a product of the series resistance multiplied by the junction capacitance.

In this work the dependence of the charge removal time of a shallow photodiode on the size of the illuminated area, is studied.

Simulation results, as well as measurement data, show that the response time is changing only slightly with the position and the size of the illuminated spot size, when very short light pulses are used. After the incidence light is over, the discharging of the photodiode continues with a time constant, which is highly independent of the size and the location of the illuminated part of the photodiode.

I. INTRODUCTION  R ecently, the demand for radiation detectors in the spectrum range bellow 200 nm has noticeably increased. For  example, the ever decreasing feature size of the projected on silicon wafers patterns has led to the development of deep ultraviolet (DUV, 1 93nm) and extreme ultraviolet (EBU, 13,5nm) lithography. The metrology and the dose control ofthe DUV/EUV pulsed sources require the use of fast and sensitive DUV/EUV radiation detectors. Photodiodes are good candidates for this type of applications. Due to the decreased penetration depth of EUV and especially DUV radiation in silicon, the depletion zone of the photodiodes, where the photo-generated charge is collected, has to be made very close to the surface [1]. Further, the electrode can not cover the active surface of the photodiode because it will absorb the radiation incidence. Instead, it is located at the edge of the active area, and is often called "ring" electrode. As a result of this, the photo-current, which removes the photo-generated  charge from the depletion zone, travels through a thin top layer with a relatively large sheet resistance. In fact, the series resistance of shallow photodiodes is dominated by the resistance of this thin top layer. The series resistance of the photodiode is of importance because it forms a time constant together with the photodiode junction capacitance, posing a lower limit to the response time of the photodiode. Recently reported research shows that the series resistance of the photodiode will be affected by the size and the location of the illuminated area [2]. This has led to the concern that the response time of the photodiode is also affected by the size of the illuminated area. In order to optimize the design of the readout circuit for DUV/EUV photodiode, we need to know its worst case response time.

For this reason, a study ofthe response time of shallow-junction photodiodes is carried out. Next in the paper we present: (II) an electrical model of the photodiode and SPICE simulation results of the photodiode response time; (III) these simulation results are compared with the simulation results from a FEM simulation; (IV) finally, an experimental test set up is presented together with the achieved experimental results, and conclusions are made.

II. EQUIVALENT ELECTRICAL CIRCUIT  The photodiode is generally read out by a trans-impedance amplifier (Fig. 1.), which effectively creates an AC short circuit across the photodiode, and converts the photo-generated charge/current into output voltage. The equivalent circuit of a conventional photodiode is shown in Fig. 2, where Rsh is the shunt resistance, C, is the junction capacitance and R, is the series resistance. The current source in parallel with the photodiode models the photo-generation of charge in the detector, as response to incident radiation. If the readout circuit has wide-enough bandwidth, the readout speed of the photodiode is mainly limited by the time constant created by the junction capacitance Cj and the series resistance Rs of the photodiode.

However, this simple lumped model does not represent accurately enough the behavior of shallow-junction DUV/EUV photodiodes. Therefore, instead of the lumped electrical model in Fig.2, a distributed RC network is proposed here, which is believed to represent in a more accurate way the photo-generated charge-transfer process, and in this way to more accurately model the response time of the photodiode.

The DUV photodiode, used as a basis for our model, has a circular active area with a diameter of 3.7mm and a sheet resistance of the top layer 10 kQ. If its illuminated area is also circular and concentric with the diode, the symmetry can simplify the model. The photodiode can then be divided into a number of rings, each of which is modeled by a RC-network (Fig. 4). The values of resistances and capacitances are derived from the following formulas:  Figure 4.

2,T (rjJ  C Cdiode ri , with Cdode = I OOpF rdiode  If a ring is illuminated, a current source is added to the node of the RC network of that ring. The value of the current is proportional to the area of the ring.

Under DC illumination, Cj can be neglected and the photodiode in reverse-bias mode (and also in short circuit mode, provided that the voltage drop over the series resistance is much smaller than the potential barrier of the p-n junction) can be looked at as a current source. As can be seen from Fig.4, the current, which takes away the charge generated near the edge of the active area can directly reach the ring electrode without seeing too much resistance on its way, whereas the current caused by the charge generated near the center of the diode active area needs to pass through all the distributed resistors.

The effective series resistance when the whole area is illuminated is thus smaller than when only a small central part of the detector active area is illuminated. This agrees with the result of a recent research [2]. Intuitively, charge generated in the photodiode center sees the whole RC ladder, while charge generated near the photodiode ring electrode sees the RC ladder divided into two parts - one, which leads to the ring electrode, and another, which reaches the center of the diode. Thus we would expect that the time constant ofa DUV photodiode, when only its center is illuminated, to be larger than when the whole surface of the photodiode is illuminated. Most of the existing EUV/EUV sources produce pulsed radiation at frequency, which can reach more than hundred kHz (for laser sources) and hundreds ofMHz for synchrotrons. The duration ofthe pulses is in the range from a few picoseconds to a few hundred nanoseconds. It is therefore important to study the response time of a DUV/EUV photodiode as a function of the size of the illuminated area, in order to determine the worst case value.

The RC ladder model ofa shallowjunction photodiode is put into a SPICE circuit simulator to extract its response time from transient simulations.

is modeled by arranging the current sources as is discussed above. The simulation results of two cases are shown in Fig.5.

The duration of the current pulse in the simulation is lOOns. As can be seen from the plot in Fig.5, with a logarithmic scale for the current, after a certain initial period the two current curves transform into straight parallel lines. This basically means that the time constants in both cases - when only the central diode area is illuminated, and when the whole diode area is illuminated, are the same with a value 46 ns.

One thing to comment on is the fact that during the illumination time, the output current of the photodiode behaves differently when the illuminated area size is different. When only the center is illuminated, the output current rise time is longer compared to the situation when the whole active area is illuminated. This difference affects the total time needed for the generated charge to be removed from the diode. It is important to mention that this time difference is small compared to the total charge removal time, and it gets even smaller for shorter incident radiation pulses.



III. FEM SIMULATION  The RC ladder model used in the previous section is a simplified model and does not take into account all the physical phenomena taking place when the photodiode is illuminated.

Previous works prove that the formulas for calculating the distributed series resistance are different with and without the presence of illumination [3] [4].

To verify the unexpected result from the SPICE simulations, the influence of the photon beam spot size on the response time of the detector has been investigated by three-dimensional (3-D) device simulations performed with Synopsys MEDICIT software [5]. In fact, this tool can be generally used to predict the behavior of semiconductor devices under arbitrary operating conditions by solving Poisson's equation and both the electron and hole current continuity equations based on a finite element method (FEM) in a 2-D structure. However, due to the symmetry of our device a full 3-D accuracy can be obtained by simulating the radial (r) and depth (z) dependence in a cylindrical coordinate system. In addition, photon generation models can be applied to study the perturbations in optical  Figure 6.

devices, such as a photodiode, caused by an incident radiation and the spectral response in steady-state or transient modes.

Therefore, we have simulated the electrical characteristics of a reverse-biased (VR = 7.5 V) photodiode when exposed to radiation with 193 nm wavelength and pulse energy of 0.55 nJ for different beam spot sizes (0. 1mm - 3.7 mm) in the center of the active area. The incident light pulse width is 120 ns. The simulated structure is representative for the measured sample in terms of circular geometry, lateral and vertical dimensions, metal electrodes, and doping profiles. Indeed, under the typical reverse-biasing conditions, the resulting sheet resistance of the active p+ top layer is about 13 kQ and the junction capacitance is about 110 pF. These values are in good agreement with the experimental data of the measured photodiode.

The results of the transient analysis in terms of photo-generated current are shown in Fig. 6. First, only a spot with a 100 ptm diameter exactly in the center of the active area has been illuminated, and a second time - the whole active area has been illuminated. Again, the exponential decay of the photo-generated current and, therefore, the time constant Tc 35 ns does not depend on the spot size of the incident radiation.

This result agrees well with the simplified SPICE RC ladder model with respect to the stability of the time constant and differs about 24% with respect to the absolute value of the time constant. The difference in the absolute value of the time constant can be explained with the different values of the sheet resistance in the two simulations, which is 23%.



IV. TEST SETUP AND EXPERIMENT RESULT Next to the simulations results, the dynamic performance of  a shallow p-n junction radiation detector has been experimentally verified. For this purpose a simple test setup for measuring the time constant of the photodiode has been created.

In the test set up we used a green light emitting LED. The penetration depth in silicon of green light (520nm-565nm) is approximately 1 gim, which is close to the penetration depth of EUV radiation (13.5nm) in silicon - 0.7 gim. In order to vary the illuminated area size, we used an optical system as shown in Fig.7. It consists of two lenses LI and L2 which focus the light  1u0    -,  v)  w:5 10   -0 LL -     LED  \ lb  Lenses  Fig. 7. Optical system for the measurement.

emitted by the LED into a point. By moving the photodiode back and forth we can vary the size of the illuminated area.

The LED was driven by a pulsed signal whose frequency was 100kHz and a pulse duration lOOns. The photodiode readout circuit is shown in Fig. 8. It is essentially a trans-impedance amplifier. The opamp used is OPA657, which has a gain-bandwidth product of 1.6GHz. The capacitance Cf in parallel with Rf is used to keep the opamp stable. The time constant related to the feedback pole is FB= RFCF= Ins which is much smaller than the simulated time constant of the photodiode (35ns - 46ns). This guarantees an authentic shape of the response characteristics of the photodiode, measured at the output of the trans-impedance amplifier.

The experimental result is presented in Fig. 9. It can be seen that the measured time constants are again the same, when the detector is illuminated, for different illuminated area. The time constant extracted from the measurement is about 98ns, which means that either the tested sample has higher sheet resistance or higher junction capacitance.

arbitrary position on the surface of the photodiode, this can easily be checked by experiment. The experimental results in Fig.eO show the difference in the photodiode response when the illumination spot is at the center ofthe photodiode and when the same spot is moved near the edge of the photodiode. Again, the measured time constant in both cases, in the time interval after the light is switched off, is practically the same.



V. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSIONS  It has been demonstrated by simulations, and also verified by experiments, that the response time of shallowjunction radiation detectors to pulsed radiation, is only slightly deppdent on the size and the location of the illuminated part of the detector active area. The existing difference in the response time is mainly a product ofthe electrical behavior ofthe detector during exposure, when it acts as a current source. After exposure, when there is no more charge generation, but only the photo-generated charge is in process of being removed from the photodiode, the size of the illuminated area does not have influence on the time constant. This can be understood in the following way: When the illumination is gone, the already generated charge tends to distribute itself over the junction capacitance of the photodiode toward an equilibrium state. This happens in parallel with the process of removing the charge from the photodiode. These two processes together provide a stable time constant, independent on the position and the size of the illuminated area.
