Abstract-Parallel association rules mining has been improved the efficiency of data mining, and meanwhile concerned with the privacy preserving problem. A simple and effective method of parallel association rules mining which based on privacy protection----Parallel Association Rules Mining Algorithm with Privacy preserving(PARMA-P)  has been introduced  in this paper; It could achieve effective concealment of frequent item-set and then the association rules by the means of using imported Hash assignment strategy in frequent item sets of FP sub tree could be protected. It has been used in HRM of an enterprise and experiments show that the algorithm can be simple and effective in protection of data privacy.

I.  INTRODUCTION The benefits brought by data mining  has  drawn the  attention of more and more businessmen and scientists.

Meanwhile  privacy and information security of that is indispensable  and it will become the key of  enterprise competition. Which made privacy data mining especially parallel privacy preserve  become a new research topic .

Many scientists and scholars  has proposed lots of algorithms in  parallel data mining field the past few years, such as CD[1] PDM[2] DD[3] FDM[4] et al.  The basic method of those  is based on the distributed processor principle[5][6][7],  that is each processor occupies its own memory and disk space and communicates to each other by internal interconnected mechanism of network.

The existing privacy protection techniques mainly include heuristic technology, security polytrophic technology and  reconstruction technology[8][9][10]. This article has introduced a privacy parallel algorithm  which combines with the characteristics of heuristic and security polytrophic technique, it can realize the concealment of frequent item sets then protect the privacy protect of association rules.  It has been applied to HRM of a company and can protect the privacy data effectively.



II. PARMA-P  ALGORITHM  A. Princeple of PARMA-P PARMA-P algorithms which could protect frequent item  sets by using  heuristic technology and input Hash allocation strategy, that is, host as the trust side is responsible for primary coding and the distributions of sub-FP trees by using Hash function. When the applications are  applied by sub computers, then, it will take the method of coding reversed with the composite sets of the results of sub parallel data mining to realize the privacy protect of association rules. ' FP  B. Description  of PARMA-P  Hash distribution and coding  Suppose 1 2{ , ,......, }n is a frequent 1-itemsets, then the subset of FP tree which suffix is  ( 1,2,...... )i i n being called Suffix FP-sub-tree group, donated as  ( 1,2,...... )i FP i n .The  front pointers of  those are  put in linear list and being set up distribution flags: '0' indicates undistributed and '1' indicates distributed. When there is application from sub-computer ,the host allocate the sub- tree according to Hash function randomly. The Hash function is as follows:  ( ) ( ( )*100)%( ( ))Hash group Rand count frequent itemsets (1.1) The results of distribution should be stored in the database which will be used in the process of reduction of frequent sets. The conflicts produced by the process of distribution can be resolved by  linear sampling method and then complete the  mapping of frequent 1-itemsets to a two- dimensional table by the following hash table:  ( ) ( (int( ( )* ), ))Hash value char convert Rand string (1.2) 2( ( ) , ( ) 100)count frequent itemsets Hash group  where  used to guarantee avoiding the emergent of coincident code and to ensure  the effectiveness of branch of suffix FP-sub tree group .

TABLE I.  THE DISTRIBUTION OF SUFFIX FP-SUB TREE GROUP  When there is application has been sent out ,the host verified the identity of sub computer, allocate the suffix FP- sub trees through Hash function, meanwhile  update IP  and flag of  Table-I. When collision occurs  it will take the hash soundex to resolve that. Fox example, the first produced hash pointer is b-FP , however, its  flag is '1' ,in other words, b-FP  is  allocated to others, it should  detect next suffix FP- sub tree's state until to find one which flag is  '0',then assign to the applicant. The  privacy protection of data is implemented by the use of  heuristic technique ,here, mainly by the use  of mapping  with frequent item sets. Tabl is the result of hash mapping about frequent 1-itemsets randomly .

TABLE II.  THE MAPPING OF FREQUENT 1-ITEMSETS          Because of taking random methods to generate hash code ,furthermore, each suffix FP-sub trees are taking different allocation strategy, the  original data  obtained the reliable privacy protection.

Process  of PARMA-P  Given a transaction database as shown in Table (min-sup=23%,that is the support counting equals 2).The result which generated by FP-Growth algorism illustrated as Figure 1 and  the distribution list is as shown in Table .

Then update the node elements of each sub tree according to Table  and obtained the mapping of them which called a'-FP tree (as shown in Figure 4) and c'-FP tree (as shown in Figure 5) and he others needn't map.  When there is new application occurred, the host will  execute similar process.

At last the frequent item sets of a'-FP  tree are reduced as follows:a:4,ba:4; the frequent item sets of c'-FP  tree are reduced as the following :c:6,ac:4,bc:4,bac:2.  In the process it shows that due to the differences of each elements of frequent item sets  and inability  of  reversing the frequent item sets ,the privacy protection of data is completed .

C. Related  Property and Theorem [11]  Property of frequent item sets: if an item set is frequent, then all of its subsets must also be frequent.

Monotonicity Property of support counting: Let I be a set of items, and J=2I be the power set of I. A measure f is monotone(or upward closed) if  , : ( ) ( ) ( )X Y J X Y f X f Y which means that if X is a subset of Y, then f(x) must not exceed f(Y). On the other hand ,f is anti-monotone(or downward closed) if  , : ( ) ( ) ( )X Y J X Y f Y f X which means that if X is a subset of Y, then f(Y) must not exceed f(X).

The experiments show that the algorithm for data privacy protection has played a good role and is practical.
