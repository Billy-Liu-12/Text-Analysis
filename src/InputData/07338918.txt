I. INTRODUCTION As the main course of mining association rules, frequent  item sets mining is a decisive factor affecting the qualities of the association rules. The problem of mining frequent item sets can be converted to mining maximum frequent item sets, because maximum frequent item sets include all the frequent item sets[1].

A large number of scholars have been paying attention to the problem of mining maximum frequent item sets since it was proposed in 1998[2]. They have made many achievements with their own efforts. Max-Min Ant Colony Algorithm (MMAS)[3] is a typical algorithm proposed earlier, and it is based on the idea of classic Apriori Algorithm and applies the strategy of breadth-first search mining maximum frequent item sets; Both DMFIA Algorithm[4] and MMFI Algorithm[5] are proposed on the basis of the classic FP-growth Algorithm, and they don?t need to generate conditional pattern tree and only need to scan the database twice; In addition, it is a new idea to mine maximum frequent item sets using Ant Colony Algorithm, and the mining efficiency is improved to a certain extent[6]. As an intelligent optimization algorithm, Ant Colony Algorithm has better performance and can effectively solve the problem of mining maximum frequent item sets, but the qualities of maximum frequent item sets mined by Ant Colony Algorithm are not high owing to uncertainty of initial pheromones. In order to improve the qualities of maximum frequent item sets, this paper combines Ant Colony Algorithm and Genetic Algorithm to mine maximum frequent item sets.



II. THE CONCEPTS OF MAXIMUM FREQUENT ITEM SETS  Let 1 2{ , ,..., }nI i i i  be a set of items and D be a transaction database, where each transaction T is a set of items such that T I  and each transaction has an identifier TID. Let X be a set of items of I, a transaction T contains X if T I  .

The support count of item set X is the number of transactions in D containing X, the formula can be decomposed in the following way:  sup (X) : ,port T X T T D                      (1)  Definition 1: If support count of item set A is not less than minimum support count(min_sup), then A is called frequent item set or all frequent item set.

Definition 2: For A I  , A is called maximum frequent item set if support(A) min_sup  and B , ( )B I A B  , we have support(B) min_sup . All the sets of A are called the set of maximum frequent item sets.

By the definitions above, we can know that the number of maximum frequent item sets is less than all frequent item sets when data set and the minimum support count are given.

Properties of maximum frequent item sets[7]: (1) If X is maximum frequent item set, any proper subset of  X is not maximum frequent item set .

(2) If X is not maximum frequent item set, any superset of  X is not maximum frequent item set .



III. HYBRID  ANT COLONY ALGORITHM OF MINING MAXIMUM FREQUENT ITEM SETS  A. The Idea of Hybrid Ant Colony Algorithm Although Genetic Algorithm (GA) has an excellent  capability of rapid global search, it doesn?t make use of feedback information in the system and often leads to useless redundant iterations. Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm (ACO) converges to the optimal path through accumulation and update of pheromone. What?s more, it has the capability of global convergence and the merit of parallelism. But ACO solves practical problems blindly for lack of initial pheromones.

To overcome shortcomings of both algorithms and form complementary advantages, it is a good way to take advantage of Genetic Algorithm generating the distributions of initial pheromones. Then, we make full use of the features of Ant  ICSPCC2015    Colony Algorithm to solve practical problems. As a result , we will find that Hybrid Ant Colony Algorithm have a better capability of application.

B.  Data Processing and Calculation of Support Counts Data in database must be processed before mining  maximum frequent item sets so that it can be identified by computer.

What have to do first is to sort items according to a kind of rule, and then delete the items that don?t satisfy the condition that support counts are not less than the minimum support count. Transaction database can be regarded as a two- dimensional matrix, rows represent transactions and the columns represent attribute items. (c )ij m nC , where  1, c  0, j i  ij  if I T  others , the support count of item ji  is:    sup ( )  m  j ij i  port I c                                               (2)  It is not necessary to re-scan the database through the process of previous step. The support count of item set  1 2{ , ,..., }kI I I  is the number of ?1?after the operation of ?and? of vectors of items, i.e.,  1 2  , ,..., m  k i i  support I I I v                   (3)  where 1 2 ...i i i ikv c c c ,  represents logic ?and?.

C. A Quality Assessment of Maximum Frequent Item Sets Maximum frequent item set is the set that support count is  not less than the minimum support count and any superset of it is no longer frequent item set, that is to say we should take both aspects into account about maximum frequent item sets:  (1) It is maximum frequent item set, i.e., for an item set X, we have sup ( ) min_support X  .

(2) Any superset of it is no longer frequent item set. We need to judge that all of its supersets are frequent item sets or not after adding an item to the subset every time, that means we will spend a lot of time in computing support counts. In order to save time, this goal can be converted into that the more the number of items item set contains, the better the quality of maximum frequent item set. i.e., (X) max( )w X .

Based on above two points, the evaluation function can be defined as follow:  sup ( )( ) * * min_ sup  port X H X l X s                        (4)  Where 0 , 1l s and 1l s , l represents the length of item set and s represents the sensitivity coefficient of support  count. We must ensure that X is frequent item set from beginning to end at the same time.

D. Design of Genetic Algorithm Mining Maximum Frequent Item Sets This paper determines the initial pheromones according to  the operating results of Genetic Algorithm.

(1) Coding: This paper uses the way of binary encoding.

(2) Fitness function: We will regard evaluation function as  fitness function.

(3) Initialization of population: All the individuals must  satisfy the condition that support counts are not less than the minimum support count.

(4) Selection operation: This paper uses the method of nonlinear ranking selection based on roulette . What?s more, we assign probabilities of selection for each member in descending order according to fitness values.

(5) Crossover operation: This paper adopts uniform crossover. First, the system generates a n-dimensional vector randomly. Its every element is 0 or 1, and then what computer should do is to find the corresponding serial numbers of 1 and 0 respectively. Finally, the progeny population selects which parent provides genetic gene according to these serial numbers.

(6) Mutation operation: The system generates a positive integer less than n randomly and then regards the integer as the number of points of mutation. What?s more, mutation rate will gradually increase with the evolution of population until it reaches 1/2 of crossover rate.

(7) Inversion operation: The system generates two numbers 1 2( )d d  less than n randomly and inverses the portion between 1d  and 2d .

(8) The end of judgment: If the number of iterations reaches eranum?the maximum number of iterations, iterations will be stopped, or the procedure will go to (4) and repeat the operations.

E. Design of Ant Colony Mining Maximum Frequent Item Sets This paper adopts Max-Min Ant Algorithm (MMAS) and  introduces a pheromone window min max, . The algorithm avoids the phenomenon of stagnation and has the advantages of positive feedback, distributed computing, parallelism, capability of global convergence and so on. On the other hand, MMAS will show its better performance after solving the problem of initial pheromone through Genetic Algorithm.

Design ideas are as follows:  (1) Construction of the maximum frequent item sets: It is different from the problem of TSP, and the feasible solutions of mining maximum frequent item sets are frequent item sets. Ant  1,2,...,t t m  will add new item into its subset according to state transition rules at every step of constructing solutions, and subsets constructed by ants contain different numbers of items. If subset becomes non-frequent item set because of adding new item to it, the system will delete the new item from the subset. Then, computer determines to stop the process of constructing subsets or not according to the form of probability as follow:    01, 0,  p p quit  others (5)  Where p is a random number dividing uniformly between 0 and 1. 0 00 1p p  is a parameter, if 0p p , ants stop constructing subsets and the results will be outputted, or ants add another new item into the subsets.

(2) Parameter settings: The parameter values of  , , and so on can affect the performance of algorithm. This paper makes use of repeated experiments to get their best combination.

(3) Determination of initial pheromone: For i I , initial pheromone 0 max min(i) GA i , GA i is the number of item i selected among the optimal solutions of each iteration of Genetic Algorithm.

(4) Rule of state transition: There are two kinds of different ways computing probabilities according to the value of parameter q0. q is a random number dividing uniformly between 0 and 1. If 0q q , rule is as follow:  arg max .

t i  l l l N  j                         (6)  If 0q q , probability equation is as follow:    .

,  .

t i  j j t i  j j j  j N  j N q  others  (7)  Where t iN  is the item set that ant t doesn?t select in the ith  iteration, j  is the pheromone of item j, j  is the heuristic information of item j and it is the average value of support counts of 2-item sets constructed by item j and all items in its subset.

(5) Local pheromone updating: The pheromone of item i will be updated immediately when ant selects item i, then the pheromone of item i will become low and the probability of being selected will become high for items non-selected. Update rule is as follow:  01i i i                         (8)  Where 0 i is the initial pheromone of  i.

(6) Global pheromone updating: Updating pheromone of  each item when all the ants finish their searches and rule is as follow:  1i i i                          (9)  i Q N i                             (10)  Where N i is the total number of support counts of maximum frequent item sets containing item  i.

Comparison of quality of maximum frequent item sets  As shown in Fig.1and Fig.2, the qualities of maximum frequent item sets mined by Hybrid Ant Colony Algorithm are better than MMAS. On the other hand, maximum frequent item sets contain all the frequent item sets, and the qualities of them determine the qualities of association rules to some extent. So, maximum frequent item sets mined by Hybrid Ant Colony Algorithm have better practical value.



V. CONCLUSION As a kind of algorithm of progressive decision, Ant Colony  Algorithm has the similar features compared with mining maximum frequent item sets and has advantages of positive feedback, parallelism and global convergence and so on, but the qualities of maximum frequent item sets mined by MMAS are not high because of lack of initial pheromones. This paper makes use of Genetic Algorithm to determine the initial pheromones. The simulation experiment is done under the condition of the best combination of parameters. Experimental results show that the qualities of maximum frequent item sets mined by Hybrid Ant Colony Algorithm are higher than MMAS. What?s more, maximum frequent item sets contain all the frequent item sets and their qualities determine the qualities of association rules to some extent, therefore, maximum frequent item sets mined by Hybrid Ant Colony Algorithm have better practical value.
