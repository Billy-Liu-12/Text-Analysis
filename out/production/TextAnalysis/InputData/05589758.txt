Abstract?Due to its intermittent nature, integrating large  quantities of wind power in power systems has serious impacts on power system operation. Wind power increases the load variation and the reserve requirements for contingencies.

Utilities are especially concerned about the wind power availability during the peak load demand time. Conventional generation can obtain capacity credit because they can produce ?firm? power during the peak load demand time. As wind power is intermittent it is normally given zero or small capacity credit.

In this paper, the wind variation and capacity credit for multiple wind farms distributed in Wyoming are analyzed based on actual wind data. Considering multiple wind farms as part of one big wind farm distributed over a large area can decrease the wind power variation and increase the capacity credits. As the method used here to calculate capacity credit is the same one used by electric utilities, the potential for awarding more capacity credit to multiple wind farms is very good.

I.  INTRODUCTION HE strength and duration of wind are location dependent.

The installed power capacity of a single wind farm ranges from a few MW to thousands of MW.

Wind power is an intermittent resource which varies continuously. The main concern about wind power is that there is not enough spinning reserve in the system when wind stop blowing, which may result in blackouts in high wind power penetration cases.

Wind energy can provide a part of the electrical demand, but consumers cannot rely completely on wind powered electric energy because it is not available all the time.

Conventional generators, such as coal-fired and hydro plants, have nominal ratings and their operational output can move between minimum and maximum rating freely. However, wind turbines are different from them because input wind speed is not controllable as steam or water flow. The output of wind turbines follow the wind speed when the wind speed is between the cut-in and nominal speed of the wind turbines.

Therefore, more reserve capacity is needed when more wind   Y. Zhang is with the Department of Smart Grid Research, State Grid  Energy Research Institute, Beijing, China (e-mail: zhangyi@sgeri.sgcc.com.cn).

turbines are integrated into the power system. Reference [1] reviewed some analytic and utility case studies on the impacts of wind power on existing power systems. There was not a definite conclusion given in [1], however, it showed that the integration costs increases with size as integrating wind power requires more reserve. The cost becomes more with higher penetration.

The availability of wind power during peak load demand hours is of more concern to the system operators than that of the off-peak hours. The load demand curves were drawn using MISO?s hourly actual load in Fig.1 [2]. It shows the daily load curve of Midwest Independent System Operation (MISO) on July 18, 2007, which is a typical summer day. The load demand increases during the morning hours and reaches the peak in the afternoon at about 4pm as indicated by ?A? in Fig.1. It is worth noting that during morning hours shown as ?B?, or late night hours shown as ?C?, the operating utilities have plenty of surplus generation available to take care of any reduction in wind generation. This is because of the fact that the utilities are prepared, based on their day-ahead or week- ahead generation scheduling, to satisfy this day?s peak demand of ?A?. During the peak demand time, more generation resources are needed to balance the load demand and the system reserve requirements for contingencies. All the units are pressed into service during these times including very high incremental cost peaking units. Therefore, availability of wind power during the peak demand time is much more valuable than at other times. As a result, the utilities award capacity credit for the firm output of generation resources which they can use at peak hours. However, wind power is intermittent and awarded zero or very small capacity credit by the utilities. It is extremely valuable financially for the wind farms to increase their capacity credit.

The time frames can be divided into four parts: 1. Real time, which ranges from several seconds to a few  minutes. Generators react to the system frequency and interchange among different control areas due to continuous load fluctuations caused by tens of millions of users freely turning on and off electrical devices. This is responded by Automatic Generation Control (AGC) with no opportunity for human intervention.

2. Short term, which ranges from approximately 10 minutes to several hours. The load changes slowly in this time frame. Economic dispatch operation is following the change of load.

3. Midterm, which ranges from several hours to several days. The start-up and shut-down time of generators? varies from minutes to hours depending on their types and characteristics. Unit commitment is made to schedule when and which generators start up and shut down ahead of time.

4. The long term time frame ranges from several months to several years. New load and generation are planned in this time frame as well as outage and maintenance schedules.

Although wind turbines have been producing electrical power, it is not generally considered for providing firm capacity in the system and only get credit for energy produced. For both large electrical power produces and users, kWh or energy cost is only about half or even less of the total electrical cost. The capacity or demand cost is most of the remaining cost which wind power produces miss out from benefiting most of the time. This paper focus on wind power?s impacts in time frame 2, i.e., short term, the most important time frame for maintaining system stability and hour-by-hour operation of the power system. This paper discusses the wind power availability and variation between individual wind farm?s location and their combination. Finally, the capacity credit is calculated separately for each location and their combination and the increase in the extremely valuable capacity credit awarded to four isolated wind farms compared to their combined effect is quantified. The difference of capacity credit rewarded between individual wind farms and multiple wind farm combinations are also presented.



II.  WIND DATA ACQUISITION One of the major challenges of wind power availability  analysis is the lack of reliable wind data. Over the last four years, the University of Wyoming Electric Motor Training & Testing Center has installed more than 30 wind measurement towers in the state of Wyoming and Nebraska. They covered a very large area of eastern Wyoming and western Nebraska.

The locations used for this study are shown in Fig. 2. The shortest and longest distances between two locations are 100 km between A and C and 300 km between B and D. The data were collected from April 1st, 2006 to March 31st, 2009. The data include the wind speeds at 60 meters, 50 meters, and 40 meters, the wind directions at 60 meters and 50 meters, and the temperatures at ground level. The quality of wind data captured by the data loggers used in this paper is over 98%  good. The data were averaged and recorded by the data loggers every 10 minutes. The time of data loggers at different locations were set via cell phones and watches. The time error of each location is estimated to be 1 or 2 minutes. The mean wind speed and the potential MW capacity of each location is shown in Table I.

III.  WIND POWER AVAILABILITY For this study, let us assume no scheduled outage or  maintenance in the wind farms. The generation only depends on the local wind speed, i.e., the wind turbines will produce electricity if wind speed is between the wind turbines? cut-in and cut-out speeds. The output of wind turbines will follow their power curves. The wind turbines used in this paper are GE 1.5XLE and its power curve is shown in [3]. Its cut-in, rated and cut-out speeds are 3.5 m/s, 14 m/s and 25 m/s, respectively [3].

10-minute-average wind speeds for four days of summer and winter are plotted from raw data and shown in Fig. 3.

From the 10-minute-average wind speeds of all locations, it can be found that the wind speeds of the four locations are seldom below the cut-in speed (about 3.5 m/s to 4 m/s) and above the cut-out speed (25 m/s) at the same time. In other words, these locations are able to partly compensate each other?s no wind condition due to geographcal dispersion.

Diurnal wind speed can describe wind speed variations in one day. The diurnal wind speeds of the four locations and the diurnal load demand of MISO are shown in Fig. 4. The wind speeds of locations A and D have similar trends as MISO load demands in both summer and winter. The wind speed of location B does not change much in a day. The wind speed of location C is fairly flat in winter and opposite to the trends of MISO load in summer. The peaks and valleys of the wind     speeds of the four locations occur at different instances of time.

(a)Summer     (b)winter  Fig. 3 10-minute-average wind speed for four days   The output power of the wind turbines cannot be estimated using average speeds because the power curves of wind turbines are not linear with speeds. Wind speed distributions, which are shown in Fig. 5, are needed to estimate output power.

The percentage of time wind power is unavailable (wind speed lower than 4 m/s or higher than 25 m/s) is from 19.4% to 29.3% in summer and from 10.6% to 23.2% in winter for an individual location. Transmission system  operators have to increase the reserve requirements to backup the wind power when a new wind farm is connected to the grid. Bigger wind farms need higher reserves. But if multiple wind farms are considered, the wind unavailable time decreases dramatically. The percentage of wind unavailable time is 3.6% in summer and 1.7% in winter when the four locations are considered together as one big wind farm distributed over a large geographical area.

The wind available time of each location is low, even the 5% wind power available time of the best location (C) is less than 85% in winter (Fig. 7). The 5% wind power available time of the lowest location (A) is only 59.74% in summer.

Therefore, much more generation resources have to be reserved for each wind farm. However, if all the four locations are considered, the 5% wind power available time (5% of total capacity of all the four location) is increased to 91.29% in summer and 96.24% in winter.



IV.  WIND POWER CORRELATION AND VARIATION Cross-correlation is used to measure the correlation  between two time series [4]. It is defined as:  ,  1 ( )( ) n  i i i  x y x y  x x y y nr  ? ? =  ? ? =  ?   where, x, y are the point of the time series, x , y  are the averages, ? is the standard deviation and n is the number of points of the time series. If the time series x and y depart, then  rx,y is near -1. If the two time series follow the same trend, then rx,y is near 1. If the time series are not correlated, then rx,y is near 0.

The cross-correlations shown in Table II are calculated based on 10 minute wind speeds. All the numbers are positive, which means any of two time series are correlated. The cross- correlations are related to the geographical distribution of the locations. Locations C and D are more correlated than other pairs because they are most close in all the locations. Location B and D are least correlated because they fall apart farthest.

One is that unpredictable wind power can increase the load variations and forecasting errors dramatically. This is true for large individual wind farms with high capacity, but if the capacity is distributed throughout many locations, the variation is not as big as an individual one. Fig. 8 shows hourly average wind power at the four locations and their combined effect. The capacity of each location is scaled from 30 MW to 120 MW ? the total capacity of the four locations, then the standard deviation of each location with scaled capacity can be compared with that of the combination.

The output power of the combination is the average of the four locations, but its standard deviation is minimum. All the four locations are not completely correlated, so they can cancel parts of the variations of each other, therefore, its variation is overestimated as far as the impacts on the system is concerned. Currently the impacts of wind farms on the power system are studied as individual farms.



V.  CAPACITY CREDIT FOR MULTIPLE WIND FARMS Capacity credit is a critical measure to power systems both  from technical and economic considerations. It indicates the amount of generating capacity that can be counted on to help meet peak electricity demand. It is directly related to system reliability. The capacity credit calculation methods and regional applications are reviewed in [5]. Some utilities and Regional Transmission Operator (RTO) use stochastic method to calculate the capacity credit. PacifiCorp is an owner of  wind power projects in Wyoming. The capacity credit of PacifiCorp is calculated using Z-method, which is a stochastic method to calculate peak load carrying capability of competing resources [7]. Others use a time-period basis to calculate wind capacity credit as shown in Table III.

Their calculations only focus on individual wind farm. The capacity credit varies from 5% to 30% of nominal ratings of wind farms depending on the methodology and the system conditions.

Z-method in [7], which has been used by PacifiCorp, can be used to calculate capacity credits for the four locations and their combination. The Reliability Test System (RTS) developed in [8] and assumptions in [7] are used because the     37,926 38,643  51,829  33,362 40,440  -10000        A B C D Combination  C ap  ac ity  (k W  )  Location   42,261  63,367 74,984  54,680 58,823  -10000         A B C D Combination  C ap  ac ity  (k W  )  Location   (a)Summer                           (b)Winter Fig. 8 Hourly average wind power with standard deviation   information from utilities is not complete. The assumption from [7] is shown in Table IV. The load carrying capability of new generation resources is defined as [7]:  L = R - Z (?L2+ ?R2) / 2?S where, R is the expected generation, Z is the ratio of the expected reserve to the standard deviation of the reserve, ?L is increment of peak load, ?R is the standard deviation of expected generation, ?S is the standard deviation of the reserve about mean. Details of calculations are given in [7].The installed wind power capacity in Wyoming is 814 MW as of April 30, 2009 [9] and the total generation capacity excluding wind power is 7,140MW. So the wind penetration in WY is 11%. The average load in WY is about 2,000 MW, which is not far from the assumption in Table IV. The four locations are scaled up to 350 MW (11% of total generation of RTS) to simulate Wyoming wind power. 4:00pm to 6:00pm in July and August is considered peak demand time in WY. The wind availability (power produced by wind is greater than 0) in four locations and their combination is shown in Tables V and VI.

The forced outage rate is the probability of zero output power of wind farms. In other words, the forced outage rate is one minus wind power availability.

TABLE IV MODEL ASSUMPTIONS  Generation Load  Reserve Mean 3197MW 2850MW 345MW Standard Deviation 231MW 200MW 307MW Z 1.126 Reserve Margin 19%   The load carrying capability is calculated for each location  with capacity of 350 MW. It is then compared with 87.5 MW each placed at those four locations, with a resulting total of 350MW, shown in the Tables V-VII as combination. The load carrying capability, i.e. capacity credit, is shown in Table VII.

The capacity credit awarded to the combination of the four locations is highest and it is over twice of the lowest location B. Even the capacity credit of the best location A is lower than that of the combination. Both the system operator and wind farm owners can benefit from the combination of the four locations: the system operator can decrease the reserve margin because combination of multiple wind farms can increase the firm output; the owners of wind farms can share the capacity  credit and lower the integration cost, which is proportional to the required reserve.

Their correlations become lower when they are distributed farther according to Table II.

If the wind farms in Wyoming and Texas 1,200 km apart are considered as one big wind power resource, a higher proportion of wind power could be considered a firm resource to produce electricity.



VI.  CONCLUSION Wind availability of a single wind farm is low, but if a  number of wind farms distributed over a large distributed area are combined and looked at as a whole generation resource, then the availability of wind power increases dramatically.

Real wind data from four locations in Wyoming is used in this paper. Compared with each location, the combination of the four locations can increase the wind availability and decrease the wind power variation. The capacity credit is higher when     the wind power from the four locations is combined. As the method to calculate capacity credit used here is also used by electric utilities, the potential for awarding more capacity credit to multiple wind farms is very good.
