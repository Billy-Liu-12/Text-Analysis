A Tree Based Data Mining Prediction Scheme for Wireless Cellular Network

Abstract  A centralized collaborative system between nodes and Base Stations (BSs) is developed, and a new prediction  mobility scheme with  Data Mining techniques is  proposed so that the service of the handoff calls can  be guaranteed.  This new approach belongs to the  Direct Group Mobility (DGM) prediction scheme and is based on the Tree Path Construction Algorithm  (TPCON) and the Merge Tree Algorithm (MTA). Two  Call Admission Control (CAC) algorithms are  developed for each BS according to the predictive or  adaptive policy for the reservation operation in order  to minimize the call dropping probability. This study deals with the system behavior only at exceptional  congestion time periods (periodical events).

1. Introduction  Many strategies have been  developed  that ensure  handoff connections are given priority over new call  attempts such as: the queuing of handoff request [1],  and the channel reservation schemes [2]. The  availability of the wireless network resources cannot  be guaranteed throughout the lifetime of a connection.

In [3] the mobile terminal with a data structure  mechanism  predicts the next moves.  The quality of  service (QoS) in cellular networks is mainly  determined by two blocking probabilities the Call  blocking probability (cbp),when    a new connection  request is not granted permission to enter the network.

and the Call dropping probability (cdp) when a  connection is violently ended during a handoff  between cells (lack of resources). We examine the  group mobility patterns of a user?s routes (going to  work, schools etc) on daily basis for a long time period  (> week) in order to discover periodical events (like  basketball game) at exceptional congestion time  periods.  During, before, or after  the events many  mobile users ask for bandwidth  all at the same  time,  which might cause dropping of the internal calls. In  this case a collaborative system between the wired and  wireless part of the network is developed. Data Mining  [4] with the terms of itemsets, association rules,  support and confidence provides us with the necessary  tools to elaborate this problem.

2. Model Description  2.1.  Wireless network structure  In our model of  the classical wireless/mobile network  with a cellular infrastructure we consider a wired  backbone and a number of base stations (BSs).

2.2. Data Mining concepts  Let I = { i1, i2,i3,?,im} be a set of literals called  items. An itemset  containing k  items is called an k-  itemset.    A transaction T (or itemset) is a set of items  such that T? I.   Let X be a set of items . A transaction T  is said to contain X if and only if  X?T [4], [5]. An association rule implies the form X=> Y, where X?I, Y?I, and X?Y = ?. For the association rules two are the basic measures, the support and the confidence.

Support (sp) of an itemset (string) stands for the  number of times that an itemset or sub-itemset appears  in the database. Common subpath (cs) is the common  part of the branch paths. The cs is the subpath ?abcd?.

Restricted Support is the support given by the first  same items that compose the cs. Extensive support is  given by extension of the support operation beyond  the first cs. The confidence c of the rule is computed  as the quotient of the supports for the itemsets c=  sup(A,B,C,D) / sup(A,B,C)[4],[5].

3.  The Direct Group Mobility  We use a collaborative system (cell-BS-node) with  the composition approach, in order to take the mobility  trend at special congestion times (periodical events)  without taking into account the user mobility profile.

The DGM based on  the groups? move, can guarantees  0-7695-2315-3/05 $ 20.00 IEEE    the service of handoff calls. The BS creates the  preprocessing phase. It gathers the tuples  according to  their arrival time and distributes them into a  predefined time period (dt). Periodically or at the end  of the day it follows the phase of sorting and  transferring the tuples (with support>ms[4])  to the  nodes for processing (finding first the paths in each BS  and among adjacent BSs and finally the most popular  group path).

Example: A group trend from cell a (BS1) to cell k  (BS2) : a ? b?d?j?k.

Fig. 1 The structure of node finding the group  trend  4. The proposed Algorithms  4.1. The Tree Path Construction Algorithm  (TPCON)  In order to find the group mobility trend  the  transformation of the routing table  into tree(s) is  needed. The purpose of Tree Path Construction  (TPCON) is to create tree(s) for each BS, while the  MTA finds the connection between the adjacent BSs.

According to the TPCON  the path with the maximum  support is considered as the root. Consecutive paths  are placed at the child positions. So ?jk? is consecutive  to the ?dj?. An order of the paths is considered at the  beginning of each BS (root), so that the  next (greater)  number (or successor path) will become the right child  of the root (or the previous node) while the path with  lower number (or predecessor path) will take the  position of the left child. Thus, for BS2 the path ?jk?  will be the right position of the root ?dj? (ord(k)>ord(j)  or 5>4), while the path ?gj? will take the left child  position of the  ?jk? (ord(g)<ord(k) or 1<5) .

4.2. The Merge Tree Algorithm (MTA)  The next step after TPCA  is the MTA. The necessity  of MTA is based on the ability to find the most critical  paths for predefined route or sequence of BSs by  finding the connection items among them. In other  words in Fig 2, we can find the most popular paths,  where users move from the starting point BS1 to the  BS2.  We compare itemsets (subpaths) starting from  the root node (or any node) of the BS1 with  the root  node of BS2. A path (? BS1, source) that has a connection with any node of  BS2  (target) can easily  be examined  (without searching the tree)  just by  focusing on the root node of BS2 and examining the  continuity of their second items.

Example: If ?dh? ? BS1  (Fig.2) then the ?dh ? cannot  be connected with any  itemset of the tree BS2 (root  ?dj?) since ord(h) < ord(j) or 2<4.

Example: A node ?dk? ? BS1 can probably have a  connection with a node of the BS2 (like the ?dj?),  since ord(k) > ord (j) or  5>4.

From the  conf BS1, BS2:  conf (dj, bd) = 65/90 =0.72,  and the  conf BS1, BS2:  conf (el, de) = 20/30 =0.66 we  finally  have the stronger confidence that is:  conf BS1,  BS2   (max (0.72, 0.66) = 0.72. The most popular path  is:?abdj?.

Example:  Fig. 2    The TPCON and MTA  5.  The predictive and adaptive Connection  Admission Control (CAC)  The CAC is executed  by the BSs.     Two values of  threshold, the th1  for the predictive case and the th2 for the adaptive case  are defined.   The adaptive CAC  is activated only when cdp>th2 .

6.  Simulation  For our experiments, we assume the uniform  mobility behavior of the users. This means that a user  BS1 (event)  cells: a,b,c,d,e,f  per  sp    cells   IC  10   100   ab      c  ?  10     90   bd      c  10     30   de      c  11     50   bk      c  BS2 cells: g,h,i,j,k,l  per   sp   cells  IC  11    65    dj     c  12    30    jk     c  12    15    kl     c  ?  13    60    gj     c  0-7695-2315-3/05 $ 20.00 IEEE    follows a cyclic pattern within a one day period. We  use time sub-periods during a day, for several weeks,  (in order to find periodical events) and examine the  mobility of each user. There are two phases of the  simulation; the initial and the main. The initial phase  contains the path generation and the discovering of the  favorite group path while the main one contains the  simulation of the arrival and service of users.   The  performance of the proposed algorithms is examined  for various user mobility patterns and three scenaria  are developed below:  1. All the kind of users. In Fig 3 we have the case of  the increase of the call dropping probability during the  rush hours. In Fig 4 we have the case of service  according to CAC (predictive) where the cdp<0.20. In  Fig. 5 the CAC (adaptive) is activated only when  cdp>0.30, and then the bandwidth is reserved only for  the handoff users. The local users are dropped (due to  lack of available channels) so that the handoff users  are serviced.

2. Users with branches and restricted support. A new set of  user mobility patterns with more branches is  considered.  Fig. 6 depicts the adaptive CAC with  restricted support. Later at t rs =49, the cdp takes lower  values than cbp  3. Users with branches and extensive support. Fig. 7 shows adaptive CAC with extensive support. Earlier,  from t es =34, the cdp takes the lower value (0.1) and  the cbp takes the higher values.

Conclusion  The innovation of our work lies on the fact that  we elaborate with a collaborative work (nodes  and BSs) discovering  periodical events over long  time periods, utilizing the critical routes.
