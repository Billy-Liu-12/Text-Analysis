I. INTRODUCTION ITH rapid development of mobile computing technology, network technology and wireless  communication technology which especially have been widely used in the area of education, mobile learning as a branch of e-learning, attracts  attention from a growing number of fields and becomes a hotspot of network education research [1]. Under the circumstance of great needs of society for continuing education ,lifelong education and more widespread individual learning, learners are often willing to take into consideration of various learners? condition as learning differences in need or motivation, etc. However, a lack of suitable course resources or teaching process will cause learners to lose confidence in the present learning environment, as a result, to cut their learning time, having an adverse impact on the learning effect [2]. To deal with those problems, authors extract a large number of information from the mobile learning system by means of Web mining technology, which as a basis provides learners with more appropriate teaching resource as well as teaching process.



II.  LITERATURE REVIEW  A.

learning, social learning, and informal learning [3].

That mobile technology provides new possibilities for  teaching has become one of the hot topics in the field of educational technology. In theory, its value lies in promoting teaching methods and performance, breaking the spatial and temporal boundaries of teaching, realizing integration of formal learning and informal learning; and in practice, it is able to remind us of how to provide high-quality education and teaching services when the base of network infrastructure and personal terminals has been laid.

B. Web Data Mining With the rapid development of information and database  technologies, people can easily access and store large amounts of data. While by the traditional data analysis tools, people can only make some surface processing on the massive data, but cannot obtain their inherent relationship and connotative information, thus fall into a ?rich of data, lack of knowledge? dilemma. To get rid of this dilemma, a technology and tool which can intelligently and automatically convert data into useful information and knowledge is urgently needed. This demand for a powerful data analysis tool brings in the data mining technology.

The 21st century has already become Network Era.

Under the circumstance, we need a valid information tool to discover?extract and filter information, as a result, web data mining comes into being. It is the application of data mining technology in the Web, which integrates different advanced technologies including web technology, data mining technology, computer technology and information technology [3]. Web mining is acquired to mine knowledge from a mass of data, and the steps of knowledge discovery are shown in figure 1.

Fig. 1.  The steps of Web mining  According to Wikipedia, web mining is the application of data mining technology to discover patterns from the web and can be classified into three different types as web usage mining, web content mining, and web structure mining [4].Web usage mining is the application that uses data mining to analyze and discover interesting patterns of user?s usage of data on the web; web content mining is the process of discovering useful information from the content of web pages that may consist of texts, images, audio or video data in the web; and web structure mining is the process of using graph theory to analyze the node and connection structure of a web site. An example below would be discovering the  Research on Mobile Learning System Based on Web Mining Zhengqiao Xu and Dewei Zhao  W  Knowledge Information Transformed Data  Data Processing  Target Data Web  Data  July 15-17, 2012 - Dalian, China     authorities and hubs of any web document, e.g. identifying the most appropriate web links for a web page [4][5].



III.  THE USE OF WEB MINING TECHNOLOGIES In a mobile learning system based on Web data mining  technology, the main data to be mined come from the recordation at the server left by the learning website?s visitors, as well as the learners? academic records, on line records, browsing patterns and etc. These data will be preprocessed and mined via Web data mining technology, and then based on that, the mobile learning system will provide targeted education to different learners according to their own knowledge structures, learning behaviors and etc., thus the learners? learning motivation and efficiency will be enhanced.

Web clustering technique is actually to find users with similar behavioral characteristics or information needs who have accessed the site, and thus gather them together, to help Web site designers have a better understanding of the access needs of different user groups and provide more personalized services after the in-depth analysis of users of cluster.

An agglomerative hierarchical clustering method uses a bottom-up strategy. It typically starts by letting each object form its own cluster and iteratively merges clusters into larger and larger clusters, until all the objects are in a single cluster or certain termination conditions are satisfied. The single cluster becomes the hierarchy's root. For the merging step, it finds the two clusters that are closest to each other (according to some similarity measure), and combines the two to form one cluster. Because two clusters are merged per iteration, where each cluster contains at least one object, an agglomerative method requires at most n iterations [6].

The thesis collects samples of learners' basic information, by means of Web mining, such as learners' gender, age, needs, learning resources, time, and location (see table 1).

And the hierarchical clustering is employed to cluster students.

TABLE 1 LEARNERS CLUSTERING ANALYSIS SCALE  Value Age Knowledge level Method Time Place Source  1 <18 Memorize Autonomy M_time (<1h) C_room C_ware  2 19- 25 Understand Collab orative  S_time (1h-2h) W_place V_tutoril  3 26- 32 Application Explor atory  L_time (<2h) Home Teach  4 >33 Analysis   Journey Book  5    Integrated  6  Evaluation  This experiment uses a questionnaire to conduct random checks on a part of the students of China West Normal University. Students sample is set as X, denoted as X = {xi | i = 1, i = 2, ..., i = n}. 500 samples are selected. Each of them has seven properties (Student_ID, Student_Gender, Educational_level, Method, Time, Place, and Source).

Quantization table based on student characteristics shown in  table 1, we process this information as a set of training samples, generate data matrix, and then convert it into dissimilarity matrix by means of Euclidean distance, as in (1).

(1)   i = (xi1, xi2, ?, xip) and j = (xj1, xj2, ?, xjp) are two p-dimensional data objects.

The algorithm starts by letting each object form its own cluster and iteratively merges clusters into larger and larger clusters, until all the objects are in a single cluster or certain termination conditions are met. The single cluster becomes the hierarchy's root [7]. In the merging step, it is found that the two clusters are closest to each other (according to the measure of distance between two clusters, as shown in (2), and then the two are combined to one.

,min ( , ) 'min  i j p pi j  p pc cd c c ? ?= ?            (2) where |p ? p?| is the distance between two objects or  points, p and p?;mi is the means for cluster, Ci; and ni is the number of objects in Ci.

We summarize different types of learners, and keep track of learners and inspect them, according to cluster analysis with SPSS, to improve the division of types of learners.

With accurate classification of learners, you can predict the behaviors of learners, and search the content that learners are interested in and better design teaching pattern for each class of students, so that learners could get as much satisfaction as possible from learning outcomes.

The data that learners are browsing can be collected from the Web servers, application servers, the clients and the proxy server ports. Taking the characteristics of mobile learning systems into consideration, we collect the data mainly from Web servers, which contain a large number of information about user accesses, such as the user's IP address, access URL, access time, access method, the number of bytes, etc. The Web logs are shown in table 2.

TABLE 2 WEB LOGS INFORMATION  Field name Directions Instance  Stu_IP The IP address of user 192.168.1.23  Stu_URL The URL user requested http://192.168.1.23/index.htm  Pre_IP the previous page user requested http://192.168.1.23/a.htm  Next_IP the next page user requested http://192.168.1.23/b.htm  Datetime The date of user access 2012.01.23,12:03:04  Agent The agent of user access Opera Mobile 12  S_byte The bytes sent 1367kb  The raw log records of the learners are not suitable for mining so that it must be processed properly [8]. The Web usage mining process can be divided into three parts, as shown in Fig.2. We divide the types of learners and partition and the session of learners into several transactions, discover the correlation between the  2 2 2 1 1 2 2  ( , ) ( | | | | . . . | | ) p p  d i j x x x x x xi j i j i j= ? + ? + + ?     knowledge points that students are interested in through using Apriori algorithm in association rules, and take advantage of the relationship of the sequence of events in the sequential patterns in students' learning process to identify the internal affairs of the mode. By studying learning content of learners, the system can predict what the students will learn next and make recommendations.

IV.  CONSTRUCTION OF MOBILE LEARNING SYSTEM In a mobile learning system based on Web data mining  technology, the main data to be mined come from the recordation at the server left by the learning website?s visitors, as well as the learners? academic records, on line records, browsing patterns and etc. These data will be preprocessed and mined via Web data mining technology, and then based on that, the mobile learning system will provide targeted education to different learners according to their own knowledge structures, learning behaviors and etc., thus the learners? learning motivation and efficiency will be enhanced.

The mobile learning system can be accessible by means of mobile phone, personal digital assistant PDA, Pocket PC connected with Internet or WAP. In order to design the system well, we need to consider a lot of factors, such as learning efficiency, learning resources, learning objects, learning costs ,etc. And mobile learning system consists of three parts: database layer, function layer, and construction layer, as shown in figure 3.

Fig.3.  Mobile learning system architecture  1) Database layer: The database has been established by using MySQL, which is in charge of three data modules: user database, knowledge database and transaction database.

User database stores the learners? data: registration information, exchange information and learning information; Knowledge database: teaching resource (courseware, video, work, etc.), test questions library and so on; transaction database contains mining data from Web mining module, e.g. learner?s characteristics, behavior, style, interests, browsing traces, etc.

2) Function layer: The core of system uses the Hierarchical Cluster of web mining to divide a large number of learners into groups, where a group of learners share similar characteristics. Based on the clustering analysis, it builds up different knowledge bases and recommends knowledge to the learners from different groups according to their own learning behaviors and statuses. Thus the learners? enthusiasm and initiative in learning can be mobilized. Meanwhile, the system can excavate learners? learning interests by association rules and update in time the knowledge base. It can also record the history of recently visited sites, monitor the students? performance, and combine automatically the available source with learner?s interests, thus to provide the learners with dynamically personalized teaching policy or content.

3) Application layer: It is the interface of users and system. The system adopts ASP.NET and SQL to realize the link between the platform and database, and keep the system run safely, make it easy, safe and dependable for the learners to use.



V. PERFORMANCE RECOGNITION To verify the customer recognition, practicability and  reliability of the learning platform, we tested the system by methods of questionnaire investigation and statistic analysis. This test was performed in a computer with processor Inter Core 2 Duo, main frequency 2.83GHZ and memory 2G.

We randomly sampled the data of 120 customers from the students of our school for a small-scaled test, and determined 7 attributes describing the students for data mining. The main contents of the questionnaire investigation are: is there any design error for system?s basic functions? Are the registration, the knowledge base creation and data collection of mining system accurate? Are the 7 descriptive attributes effective? Is the clustering method reasonable? Is the test result on system approved? Is the system helpful for promoting the mobile learning [9]?

According to the statistic analysis on the investigation result, 92.12% learners think the system collected learning behaviors data of learners are in line with the actual, 95.36% of teachers think that the 7 attributes describe accurately the students? online learning behaviors, the clustering method is reasonable, the system can recommend pertinent knowledge to each cluster and learners from different clusters can communicate and cooperate properly, and 96.67% of the investigated think this system is helpful for facilitating learning, but the knowledge recommendation database still needs to be improved [10].

Transaction database  Knowledge database  Pattern analysis  Database layer  Web usage mining  Association rules Web site file  Logs Data Preprocessing  Mobile learning system Learner  User database     Function layer            Clustering   Application layer     The author invited 120 learners to log in this system at the same time for a simulation test. He monitored the learning process of learners and tested the system?s capability to handle the concurrent events.

The test result indicates that the mobile learning system based on Web data mining allows any learner enter it through network to learn freely via any equipment anywhere anytime. The interactive interface is friendly, the question database is rich and the recommendation knowledge base is individualized. The system records and monitors the learners? information by the mining module, makes educational policies and contents fit to them. It meets the demands of mobile learners and reaches the expected goal of system designing.



VI.  CONCLUSION The scatter of mobile learning time determines the scatter  of mobile learning resources knowledge points, which breaks the integrity of learning system, so that it?s hard to build up systematical knowledge structure with the sole help of mobile learning. The article aims to the systematical study of Web data mining technology, mainly focuses on the study of Hierarchical clustering method, Apriori algorithm in association rules and Web usage mining.

Through the technology above as well as the mobile learning theory and the analyze of internet learners, it?s available to realize the combination of new technology and advanced learning theory, meet people?s needs to conduct mobile learning anytime, anywhere, freely, personalized, diversifying in order to improve the quality of education, balance the development of education and cultivate more excellent people.
