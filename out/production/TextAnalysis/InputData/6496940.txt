Creating Standardized Electronic Data Sheets

Abstract - The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) continues to develop infrastructure to enable the  modular construction of satellites using an open network  architecture and off-the-shelf avionics for space systems.

Recent efforts have included the refinement of an  ontology to formalize a standard language for the  exchange of data and commands between components,  including hardware and software, which is still evolving.

AFRL is also focusing effort on creating standard  interfaces using electronic data sheets based on this  recently defined ontology. This paper will describe the  development of standard interfaces that are documented  in terms of an electronic datasheet for a specific  application. The datasheet will identify the standard  interfaces between hardware devices and software  applications that are needed for a specific satellite  function, in this case, a spacecraft guidance, navigation,  and control (GN&C) application for Sun pointing.

Finally, the benefits of using standardized interfaces will  be discussed.
