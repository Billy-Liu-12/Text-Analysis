Geographically Targeted Information Dissemination System (GeoTIDeS)

Abstract This paper presents the architecture of a middleware platform called GeoTIDeS (Geographically Targeted Information Dissemination System) that enables the implementation of location based wireless applications.

The platform implements the following capabilities that can be accessed by applications through the GeoTIDeS application programming interface (API): 1) A geographically targeted information multicast service that enables an application to send data directed at mobile appliances situated within a specified geographic area; 2) A range-restricted information dissemination service that delivers data to mobile appliances within a given range of the information disseminator; 3) A banner-in-the-sky service that allows information to be "posted" within a specified geographic region. The posted information is then delivered to mobile appliances entering the region.

GeoTIDeS is implemented as a network service that runs over IP. Any Internet-connected wireless or wired device can use GeoTIDeS services to send or receive geographically targeted information. No changes to the existing network infrastructure are required to deploy GeoTIDeS'2.
