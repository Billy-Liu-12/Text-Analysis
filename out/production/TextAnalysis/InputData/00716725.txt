ABSTRACT Based on the physiological evidence, we propose a hypothesis on how association and dissociation of event  memories are made in the hippocampal-cortical memory system. It is postulated that the association / dissociation of memory is carried out by indexing the representations of events (memory contents) with temporal codes. The memory contents are supplied from the sensory association cortices, while the temporal codes are supplied from decision making / motivation area. The two inputs are mixed (indexing) in the ento-perirhinal area. Indexed signals are fed to hippocampus where connection / disconnection of memory contents occur depending on the kind of index.

Finally, association / dissociation of event memories is made in the association cortex according to a covariance rule: two events memories are associated when direct cortio-cotical inputs and indirect inputs from the hippocampus are positively correlated through the consolidation made in hippocampus, and they are dissociated when two inputs are negatively correlated in consequence of the disconnection made in the hippocampus.

Keywords: A hippocampal-cortical memory system, index theory, temporal pattern codes.

1. The hippocampal-cortical memory system corresponds to a neural network with three layers The hippocampal-cortical memory system consists of the following components; the neocortex, the hippocampus  and the ento-perirhinal (ento- perirhinal, and parahippocampal cortices) area. The entorhinal cortex (EC) is the major source of projections to the hippocampus. It receives projections from the unimodal and polymodal areas of the frontal, temporal and parietal lobes of the neocortex, via the adjacent perirhinal (PR) and parahippocampal (THDH) cortical area. The entorhinal cortex also receive other direct input from the orbital frontal cortex, the cingulate cortex, the insular cortex and the superior temporal gyrus. Thus, the ento-perirhinal cortical area makes up a part of the interface between the neocortex and the hippocampus. The hippocampal networks consist of the dentate gyrus (DG), and the CA3 and CA1 regions where cells are interconnected by widespread and overlapping projections [ l ] .

The widespread efferent projections leave the hippocampus by way of the subiculum (S) flow to the EC area and continue to the neocortex [2]. Physiologically Squire and Zola-Morgan [3] posited that the neocortex represents visual object quality (in area TJ3) and object location (in area PG) as long-term memory, while the hippocampus plays am important role at the time of learning in establishing long-term memory which is then stored in the neocortex. The hippocampal process, which works only temporary as short-term memory, serves as a device for forming conjunctions between ordinarily unrelated events or stimulus features which are processed and represented by distinct cortical sites. After learning, memory stored in the neocortex becomes independent of the intervening temporal lobe structure. Thus, we assume that the memory system is composed of neural networks with three layers; the input layer, the hidden layer and the output layer. The neocortex may be thought of as the input-output layer, where information is represented in terms of the activities of assemblies of neurons and it serves as long-term memory. The hippocampus corresponds to the hidden layer where short-term memory is developed. The ento-perirhinal cortical area is an interface between the neocortex and the hippocampus. Schematically this memory system is shown in Fig. 1.

2. Neural coding in the memory system Almost all of the models of the associative memory studied previously are based upon the algorithm of taking  auto- and cross-correlation of different inputs [4-71. This process is a kind of computation of similarity of input patterns. To ensure an accurate recall, the above models store different pattems by transforming them into mutually orthogonal signals. However, it would be generally accepted a simple psychological inspection that the event     _---- c  area TA) as long-term (b) The entorhinal and parahippocarnpal between the neoccrtex projections from of projections to cortices also making area (DN) these projections (c) The hippocanpus the dentate gyrus plays an import;,nt establishing  NEOCORTEX  memory.

The input-output layer of the network corresponds to the neocortex, the index layer corresponds to the ento- perirhinal cortical area and the hidden layer correspond to the hippocampus.

(a) Activation of an assembly of neurons in the neocortex represents a perceptual feature as a spatial code; visual object quality in area TE, visual object location in area PG, information for auditory recognition in area TA, etc..

(b) In the index layer, the spatial vector is indexed by a temporal code sent from the decision making area i.e., it is transformed into a spatio-temporal vector of which the temporal part represents the index and the spatial part represents the information content.

assemblies of neurons, as the distribution of synaptic strengths of neural networks. Pulm [lo] and Amari [ l l l theoretically demonstrated that a sparse cording by assmblies of neuron is the most desirable method from the view point of information capacity. Physiological evidence supporting a sparse coding has recently been found in Inferior Temporal [SI. We postulate that the spatial pattem of the sparse activities of assemblies of neurons in the neocortex represents events. Memories of different modalities and submodalities are stored in different cortical areas: visual object quality in area TE, visual object location in area PG, information for auditory recognition in area TA, etc.

2. 2. A temporal coding in the ento-perirhinal cortical area as an indexer of memory The ento-perirhinal cortical area may be functioning as an indexer to associate / dissociate memories by using  temporally modulated patterns. In the ento-perirhinal cortical area, inputs from the neocortex represented by spatial patterns (events) are modulated temporally by inputs (indexes) from the decision making area. One of important decision making areas may be the frontal cortex. The interaction between both inputs generates a spatio-temporal pattem. One of effective temporal modulation (temporal code) would be rythms with different second order statistics (serial correlation coefficients) of the impulse sequence. There is at present no direct evidence that the ento-perirhinal cortices use temporal code as an index. However, the possibility of using temporal code as an index is strongly supported by the fact that rhythmic activities are very common in the entorhinal cortex [I21 and related areas [13-161.

2.3. Learning rub at the early stage to associate I dissociate events in the hippocampus hased on the index  Hippocampus works as a hidden network to construct a new memory structure in the association cortex through the inferface of ento-perirhinal area. In this theory, it is assumed that hippocampal network associate I dissociate events according to the kind of indexes joined with them. We propose that hippocampus uses a temporal code as an index. We stress this because homosynaptic and associative LTP of CA1 neurons were shown to be highly sensitive to a temporal modulation of Schaffer collateral stimulation. Our observations showed that the stimulus with positive correlation of successive inter-spike intervals (ISIS) generated a large homo- and associative synaptic LTP, that of negative correlation was ineffective, and the stimulus with no correlation induced a moderate LTP [17,18,19]. Thus we hypothesize that the positive correlation works as the joining index code (T') which associate different events, negative correlation works as a disjoining index code ( T 9  which dissociates two events. No correlation works as a neutral code which mantains the present state. One more assumption is introduced. That is, to associate / dissociate indexed events, rough synchronization (spatial correlation) of input events is required. Our proposal is that when two spatial vectors (the representation of events) are in synchrony with the index T', they are associated, and when they are in synchrony with the index To, they axe dissociated.

This is shematically shown in Fig. 3.
