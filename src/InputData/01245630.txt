Associations: Abstractions over Collaboration*  Bent Bruuu Kristensen

abstractions but these relatiodassociations only cover structural aspects, not collahoration.

Sequence and colloboration d i a g r m  in UML [31 support the description of object interaction by means of method invocation, but not as abstractions and not integrated with the relations/associations of objects.

Complex associations [9] are object-extemal abstractions and. support only complex struchual relationships between complex, shuctured objects.

Subject-oriented programming [7 ]  and subjective behavior [13] support different views on objects respectively from an external and internal perspective, but not relationships between objects.

Activities [Ill,  [SI are abstractions over collaborations of objects, but include no support of roleification of objects participating in the c o U ab o ra ti on.

Roles [12], [lo] are abstractions over roleification of objects for various relationships of objects, but no explicit collaboration is included.
