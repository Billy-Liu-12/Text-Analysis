A Comparison of Performance between Two Cluster

Abstract? The K-means (KM) and Self-Organizing Map  (SOM) are two popular and very different techniques for  clustering data. Both techniques require a set of training  data which are used in an iterative process to find clusters  in this set. For the KM, the number of clusters must be preas-  signed before a training session begins, whereas, the number  of SOM clusters is determined after a single training is com-  pleted. In this paper we compare the clustering performance  of these two methods using data from three mineral spectral  libraries whose samples have been hierarchically labeled with  Class, Subclass, and Group names. These names are used to  determine the overall mineralogical purity of the clusterings  as a function of cluster number. The degree of cluster overlap  is also determined as a function of cluster number using the  Davies-Bouldin (DB) index. We show that, in general, the  purity and overlap of KM and SOM derived clusters differ  significantly for cluster numbers small compared to the num-  ber of training samples. The KM clusters are less pure and  overlap more than SOM clusters. The ramifications of these  results on the accuracy of classification of spectra not used  for training is discussed.
