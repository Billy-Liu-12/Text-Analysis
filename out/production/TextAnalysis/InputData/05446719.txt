Abstract? A 320 Mbps radiation-tolerant discrete wavelet transform application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chip has been developed.  12The ASIC chip implements the discrete wavelet transform functionality specified by the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) recommendation for Image Data Compression. Input sample precision is configurable up to 16 bit values, and the filter functions in both integer and floating modes are also highly configurable.  The design is implemented in 0.25um CMOS utilizing a custom library designed around radiation-hard- by-design (RHBD) techniques and targeted operation from -55 to 125 degree C.  The chip has been verified functionally and under radiated conditions demonstrating an LET onset threshold greater than 55 LET and latchup immunity beyond 120 LET.  A plan is in place to further test the functionality of this ASIC at extremely low temperatures at the GSFC cryogenic test facilities.
