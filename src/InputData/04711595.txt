CooLBIST  An Effective Approach of Test Power Reduction for LBIST

Abstract Low power design is becoming the mainstream in VLSI. However, since most of the technologies minimizing power consumption have only focused on normal mode operation, test mode operation is often posing the high power consumption because of the high switching activity during scan shift operation.

On the other hand, test data volume has become big issue as the size of digital designs continues to grow. Logic built-in self-test (LBIST) is well known as one of the technologies to reduce test data volume. In general, LBIST uses pseudorandom pattern generator (PRPG) with high switching activity. Therefore LBIST makes high power consumption during scan shift operation. As the results, it increases test time (costs) because test engineer has to slow down shift speed to solve power issue. Now, we propose new technique called CooLBIST that controls switching activity during scan shift operation of LBIST. Application result shows that new activity control technique succeeds in reducing the switching activity during scan shift operation without a decline in fault coverage.

1 Introduction Test data volume has been becoming larger as the size and the complexity of digital designs continue to grow. Therefore manufacturing test comprises a growing fraction of a modern VLSI device's total cost. LBIST is the technique of designing additional hardware and software features into LSI and allow them to perform self- testing, i.e., testing of their own operation using their own circuits, thereby reducing dependence on external automated test equipment (ATE).

We are using LBIST tool named SINGEN1 in order to reduce the test cost of VLSI. SINGEN possesses test clock controller (TCC) controlling a complex synchronous clock. Then, as a result, it supports intra-domain and inter-domain at- speed test. However, SINGEN causes high power consumption on test mode operation since it uses PRPG with high switching activity for supplying values to scan-chains. And it increases  test costs because of slowing down shift speed to solve power issue.

2 Power Reduction Configuration of SINGEN  As shown in Fig. 1, SINGEN has PRPG, multi input signature register (MISR), TAP controller based on IEEE1149 and TCC as the basic scheme. Then, in order to reduce a test power, it has the activity control logic (ACL) to decrease the switching activities, in the output side of PRPG. The dedicated PRPG (PRPG-A) controls whether ACL output is updated with either the value or the reversed value from PRPG or is kept with a previous value. These schemes can control switching activity and supply high randomized patterns.

3 Application Result Fig.2 shows the toggle rate of the pattern with ACL technique and without ACL technique.

Both of these patterns have similar test coverage.

New activity control technique is able to reduce the switching activity during scan shift operation without a decline in fault coverage.
