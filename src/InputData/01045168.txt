Association Rules and Non-Classical Logics

Abstract  Implication of association rules is compared with material implication and conditional in standard con? ditional models jor conditional logic. Then, association rules are shown to be translated into probability-based graded conditionals. Further co-occurrence as the ba? sis for confidence of association roles is examined and then evi dence-based confidence is newly introduced.

1. Introduction  Since Agrawal et aL[IJ proposed association rules in data mining, emphasis has been put on the impor? tance of their practical advantages and, in fact, a huge number of research have been contributed to the topic as a very active area. In the other hand, their logical foundation still seems not to be fully developed. What forms do the rules have precisely as logical sentences?

What meaning do the rules have from a logical point of view? In particular, it is an interesting task to compare the implication of association rules with other kind of implications in classical and non-classical logics.

Thus we must take a first step for such an approach to examination of association rules with respect to var? ious kinds of implications, in particular in this paper, concerning conditionals formalized by Chellas[2]. In [7, 8, 9J, the authors tried to understand the implication as conditionals in conditional logics and their measure? based extensions that allows graded conditionals. In this paper, after describing the works in a united way, we propose eVidence-theory-based treatment of confi? dence in the framework, where evidence is used in the sense of Dempster-Shafer theory[ll].

2. Association Rules  Let I be a finite set of items. Any subset X in I is called an itemset in I. A database is comprised of transactions, which are actually obtained or observed  0730-3157/02 $17.00 (0 2002 IEEE 1158  itemsets. In this paper, we define a database V on I as <T, V>, where T = {I, 2,???, n} (n is the size of the database), and V : T -> 2I. For an itemset X, its degree of support seX) is defined by  (X) ? I{t E T I X <;;; V(t)}1 s . ITI '  where I . I is a size of a finite set.

Definition 1 (Agrawal et a1.[l]) Given a set of items I and a database V on I, an association role is an implication of the form X ===> Y, where X and Y are itemsets in I with X n Y = 0. I The following two indices were introduced in 11J.

Definition 2 (Agrawal et a1.[1])  1. An association rule r = (X => Y) holds with confidence c(r) (0 :s c(r) S 1) in D if and only if c(r) = seX U Y)js(X).

2. An ass?ciation rule r = (X => Y) has a degree of support s(r) (0 :.:; s(r) :.:; 1) in V if and only if s(r) = seX U V). I  3. Crisp Association Rules in Condi? tional Models  In this section, we illustrate translation of associa? tion rules with full and no confidence, which is called crisp rules in this? paper, into standard conditional models for conditional logic.

3.1. Conditional models for databases  Given a set of items I, the language CedI) is con- .

structed in the usual way where we regard any item as an atomic sentence. That is,  1. If x E I then x E CedI).

2. T,.l E LcdI}.

3. If p E .cCL(I) then -,p E CcdI).

4. If p, q E .ccdI) then pll q, pV q,p--+q, p ...... q, pr> q E  .ccLCI), . where T(the truth constant), ...l (the falsity constant) ,  -, (negation) , II (conjunction), V (disjunction), --t (ma? terial implication) , ...... (equivalence), and r> (condi- tional).

.

Definition 3 For a given database V = <T, V> on I, its corresponding standard conditional model Mv is defined as a structure <W, I, V>, where (1) W = T, (2) for any world (transaction) t in Wand any set of itemsets X in 2I, I(t, X) ? X, (3) for any item x in I,  ( t) ? {I, if x E Vet), V x, ? 0, if x (t Vet). I  The model Mp just defined is called finite because so is W. Further, in this paper, we call the model Mp uniform since the function f in the model does not depend on any world in Mp.

Define a relation F between a model, a world and an atomic sentence by  Mp, t F x iff vex, t) = 1.

The relation 1= is extended for any compound sentence in the usual way. In particular, for conditional r>,  where IIpll MD, called the truth set or proposition of a sentence p in M p, is defined by  .

IIpIIMt:' ? {t E WIMp, t 1= pl? A sentence p is said to be valid in Mp just in case it is true at any world t in Mp. The uniformity means that, if some conditional is not valid, then its negation is valid, and vice versa.

3.2. Crisp association rules  In this subsection, we discuss correspondence of crisp association rules with material implication, con? ditionals, and relative modal sentences, respectively, in the conditional models for databases.

Basic properties. First , we show several lemmas.

Lemma 4 Given a database V = <T, v> on I, for an association rule r = (X ==> Y) in V, we have  c(r)::o 1 iffW E T (if X ? Vet) then Y ? Vet??, c(r) = 0 iff WET (if X <; Vet) then Y <; V(t)C). I   Definition 5 For an association rule r = (X ==> Y) in V, let X = {:r:l" ",Xk} and Y = {Vl'''',Ym}' Then, two sentences px and Py are defined by  df Px = Xl 1\ .. . 1\ Xk, df py = YI II . . . 1\ Ym' I  Lemma 6 G iven a database V on I and its standard conditional model Mv, for any itemset X ? I and any world (transaction) t E T, we have .

X<;V(tJifftEIIPxIlMt:'. I  By Lemmas 4 and 6, we have the following lemma:  Lemma 7 Given a database V on I and its stap? dard conditional model MD, for an association rule r == (X ==> Y) in V, we have  c(r) "'" 1 iff \lpx \1M." .;; IIpyIlM." , c(r) "" 0 iff IipxllM." ? lI-,pyIIM.". I  Association rules as material implication. By Lemma 6, we have the next theorem:  Theorem 8 Given a set of items I and a database 1) on I, for an association rule r = (X ==} Y) in V,  c(r) == 1 iff MD F PX --> py, c(r) = 0 iff MD F PX --+ -'Py? I  Thus we can understand association rules with full and no confidence by validity of the corresponding material implication in the model, which means we need help of a meta-language. Thus material implication does not allow us to represent association rules within the (ob? ject) l anguage .ccL(I). It is obvious because material implication is truth-functional, which means its truth value is determined at each world (transaction) . On the other hand, crisp association rules depend on the whole of transactions, so the characteristic of associ? ation rules is not truth-functional but modal. In this sense, it is insufficient to deal with association rules by material implication.

Association rules as conditionals. Next, we il? lustrate association rules as conditionals in standard conditional models (cf.17, 81). Again, by Lemma 6, we have the following theorem: Theorem 9 Given a database V on I and its corre? sponding conditional model Mv, for arbitrary associ? ation rule r = (X ==> Y), we have  c(r) = 1 iff Mp,t F PX l> py, 0< c(r) < 1 iff Mv, t 1= -'(Px l> py) 1\ -'(px l> -,py) ,  c(r) = 0 iff Mp, t 1= px r> -'py, for each world t in MD. I    Thus, we can assert the following two points:  1. Crisp association rules are explicitly represented within the (object) language CCL(I).

2. Association rules with intermediate confidence also have their (insufficient) counterparts in the (object) language.

Nevertheless, the language is insufficient to grasp inter? mediate confidence, then we need graded conditionals to describe the entire class of association rules. Before  . 'proceeding, we note another equivalent form of associ? ation rules in the same setting (cf. [91).

Association rules as relative necessary sen? tences. Given a database V on I, in its correspond? ing conditional model MD, the function f induces the following binary relation on W for each sentence p in .ccL(I):  Thus a standard conditional model is equivalent to the following Kripke-style model for multi-modal logic:  <W, {Rp}PE.ccdI)' V>.

From this point of view. conditional p [> q is regarded as the following relative necessary sentence [P]q (d.

Chellas[2]'p.269). That is,  Mvt 1= p!> q iff Mv, t 1= tFlq? By this translation, we have the following theorem:  Theorem 10 Given a database V and its corre? sponding conditional model Mv, for arbitrary asso? ciation rule r = (X """"* Y),  c(r) = 1 iff MD, t F [Pxjpy, 0< c{r) < 1 iff Mv,t F '([Px]py) /\ ,([Px]""PY).

c(r) = 0 iff Mv, t F [Px]'PY, for each world t in MD. I This form of association rules would be useful to con? sider them in the framework of rough set theory[lO] and granular computing[3].

4. Association Rules in Graded Condi? tional Models  4.1. Minimal conditional models  To begin with, we have to explain minimal condi? tional models, which are Scott-Montague-Iike extension of standard conditional models[2].

Definition 11 (Chellas[2], p.270) A minimal condi? tional model MMCL for conditional logic is a structure <W.g, V>, where Wand V are the same ones as in the standard conditional models. The difference is the  w second term g : W x 2w --.22 ? I  The truth condition for [> in a minimal conditionaJ model is given by  MMcL. W F p [> q ? ilqllMMCL E g(w, I!pIlMMCL).

Note that, if the function 9 satisfies the following con? dition  for every world wand every sentence p. then, by defin? ing  fg(w, IIp!lMMCL) ? ng(w.llpIlMMCL).

we have the standard conditional model <w, fg, V> that is equivalent to the original minimal model.

4.2. Graded conditional models for databases  Given a finite set I of items as atomic sentences, a language .cgcdI) for graded conditional logic is formed from I as the set of sentences closed under the usual propositional operators such as T, .i, " 1\, V, --., and ...... as well as [>k (graded conditional) for D<k:'Sl. The difference from CedI) is  ? If [p,qE.cgcdI) and O<k9] then p[>kqELgcdI).

A graded conditional model is a minimal conditional model whose function g is defined by some measure.

Definition 12 Given a database V on I, a graded conditional model Mgv for V is a structure <W, {gdO<k?lt v>, where Wand v are the same ones as in the standard conditional models for a database.

The second term is a family of functions defined by a measure m:  The model MgD is called finite because so is W. Fur? ther, in this paper, we call the model Mgv uniform since functions {gd in the model does not depend on any world in MgD.

The truth condition for [>k in a grade conditional model is given by  Mgv, w F P [>k q iff IIqUM?v E 9k(t, IIp!lMgv).

The basic idea of this definition is the same as in fuzzy? measure-based semantics for graded modal logic de? fined in [4, 5, 6].

4.3. Association rules and graded conditionals  The degree of confidence is nothing but the well? known conditional probability , so we define function 9k by conditional probability.

Definition 13 For a given database V on 1, its cor? responding probability-based graded conditional model MgD is defined as a structure <W, {9dO<k.$l,V>, where  gk(W,X) ? {Y ? 2w I Pr(Y!X) ? k}.

Pr is the familiar conditional probability: for any X, Y(? 0) in ZI  . jXnYI Pr(YIX) = 1Xl' I The truth condition of graded conditional is given by  We have several soundness results based on probability? measure-based semantics (cf.[4, 5, 6]) shown in Table l.

Then we can have the fonowing theorem:  Theorem 14 Given a database V on I and its cor? responding probability-based graded conditional model MgP, for an 3Ssociation rule r = (X =? Y) with a positive degree of confidence c(r), we have  err) ? k iff MgP 1= Px I>k py. I  5. Evidence-Theory-Based Confidence  5.1. Confidence and co-occurrences of items  The standard confidence!!] is based on the idea that co-occurrences of items in one transaction are evidence for association between the items. Since the definition of confidence is nothing but a conditional probability, even weights are a priori assigned to each? transaction that contains the items in question at the same time.

All of such transactions, however, do not necessar? ily give us such evidence because some co-occurrences might be contingent. Thus we need a framework that can differentiate proper evidence from contingent one.

5.2. Confidence space  We introduce a confidence space in order to dis? cuss how degrees of confidence are computed. Given a database V on I and an association rule r =   (X =7 Y) in V, let us call R = {T, f} a confi? dence space for r, where f denotes the negation of T. Then, we define a basic probability assignment (mass function) bpa on R. Let Mgt> be some graded conditional model for V, although, so far, functions {gd are not defined. Let a = IlIpxllMgPI and b = IlIpx ApyllMgDI? Then a - b = IlIpx 1\ -'py!IMgXlI and b/a = Pr(llpx t\ pyllMgD IlIpx IIM,XI),  In this paper, we make the following uniformity ? sumption for simplicity.

Al Each world (transaction) t in lIpx nM,XI is given an even mass (weight) !.

This does not lead any loss of the essential argument in this section. To generalize the distribution is of course another interesting task .

5.3. Probability-based confidence: Strongest case  In?the usual way of computing degree of confidence, there are the following further two assumptions  A2 Transactions in Ilpx 1\ pyllMgn contribute as evi? dence to r.

A3 Transactions in IIpx A --.pyIlM.XI contribute as ev? idence to f.

This is the strongest interpretation of co-occurrences.

Then, a basic probability assignment bpa on R can  be defined by the following assignment of the masses to the confidence space R:  Subsets Masses {T,T} Q {r} Ix/) 0.

{f} I x (a - b) a 0 0  Sum 1  This is a probability distribution on R, so the induced belief and plausibility functions, denoted respectively Behl'u and Plbpa, collapse to the same probability mea? sure Prbpa and thus we have  b BeibpaCr) = Plbpa(r) = Prbpa(r) = -, a  which is just a conditional probability,  5.4. Plausibility-based confidence: weakest case  In general, co-occurrences do not necessarily mean actual association. So the weakest interpretation of co-occurrences is to consider it totally unknown as de? scribed as follows:    Table 1 Soundness results of graded conditionals by probability measures O <k<? ?<k<l k=l Rules and Axiom schemata  0 0 0 RCEA.

Then, a basic probability assignment bpa' on R can be defined by the following assignment of the masses to the confidence space R:  Subsets Masses  {r, r} - x b a {r} 0 {T} ! X (a - b) 0 0  Sum 1  This is a nested bpa on R, so the induced belief and plausibility functions, denoted respectively Belbpa' and Plbpa." become necessity and possibility measures. In fact, we have  NeCbpa,{r) = Be1bpa,(r) = I:K?{r}bpa'(K) = 0, Posbpa'(r) = Phpa,(r) = EKn{r};e0bpa'(K) = ?.

Thus we have  The equation tells us that the same confidence, which is usually interpreted as a probability, can be regarded  pt-tq (p t>k q) t-t (q t>k q)  q ..... q' (p t>k q) t-t (p t>k g')  q -+ q' (p t>k q) -+ (p t>k q')  (q/\q') --tr ?p t>k q) /\ (p t>k q'? -+ (p t>/< r)  q p t>k q  (qll\???/\qn)-+q ?p t>k qt) /\ ... /\ (p t>k qn? -+ (pt>k q)  (p t>k (q 1\ r? -+ (p t>k q) /\ (p t>k r) (p t>k g) 1\ (p t>k r) -+ (p t>k (q 1\ r?

(p t>k q) V (p t>k ...,q)  as a value of a possibility measure, which is the basis of plausible, or more precisely, possibilistic inference in this case. The result corresponds to the fact that all of association rules mined from a database are not  actually effective. We have several soundness resuJts based on possibility-measure-based semantics (cf.[4, 5, 6]) shown in Table 2.

6. Concluding Remarks  In this paper, after describing association rules as graded conditionals, we introduced evidence-theory? based confidence. It allows customers to introduce a posteriori knowledge into the process of mining associ? ation rules.

For example, let b' transactions be precisely evidence for r while the rest b - b' transactions be unknown, where recall b is the size of Ilpx 1\ pYIIMov. Then, a basic probability assignment bpa" on R can be defined by the following assignment of the masses to the con? fidence space R:  Subsets Masses {r, f} a x (b - b') {r} 1 x b'  1 a {r} - xa-b a 0 0  Sum 1     Table 2.

Thus we have a tool that allows us to introduce various kinds of 'a posteriori' pragmatic knowledge into the logical setting of association rules.
