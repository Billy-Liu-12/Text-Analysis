I. INTRODUCTION Time series classification is an important topic in data mining research. Et is concemed about discovering classification models (classifiers) in a database of pre- classified time series and using them to classifL unseen time series. Time series data typically contain a large amount of noises [27]. The ability to handle noises effectively is therefore crucial for a classifier to be useful.

To better handle the noises in time series data, we propose a new data mining technique to discover fuzzy rules in the data in this paper. The f u a y  rules discovered employ fuzzy sets to represent the revealed regularities and exceptions. The resilience of fuzzy sets to noises allows the proposed approach to better handle the noises embedded in the data.

Furthermore, it uses the adjzcsted residual [ 151, [ 161 as an objective measure to evaluate the interestingness of association relationships hidden in the data. The adjusted residual analysis allows the differentiation of interesting relationships from uninteresting ones without any user- specified thresholds. It is also resilient to noises hidden in the data [15], [16]. It has been shown to be very effective in classification [7], [9] and association rule mining [SI, [13], [14] &amp;om relational and transaction data.

In this paper, we apply the adjusted residual to mine fuzzy rules in time series daata. Although the high dimensionality, very high feature correlation, and the large amount of noises that characterize time series data have been considered a Keith C. C. Chan Department of Computing The Hong Kong Polytechnic University Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong E-mail: cskcchan@comp.polyu.edu.hk unique research challenge [27], our work shows that the adjusted residual is able to perform data mining effectively in not only relational and transaction data but also time series data.

The rest ofthis paper is organized as follows. In Section 2.

we describe the related work in mining time series. In Section 3, we present the details of the proposed approach to mining fiizzy rules in time series data. To evaluate the  performance of our approach, we applied it to several well- known time series datasets. The experimental results are given in Section 4. Finally, in Section 5 ,  we conclude this paper with a summary.

' 11. RELATED WORK Many data mining approaches have been proposed for time    Many data mining approaches have been proposed for time series classification in the data mining literature (e.g., [6], typically focus on the introduction of a new similarity measure as a subroutine to an existing classification algorithm (e.g., the l-Nearest Neighbor algorithm). Although these approaches may classify unseen time series accurately, they do not focus on revealing the regularities and/or exceptions hidden in the time series data explicitly. Recently, it has been shown in [27] that these approaches performed poorly when compared to the Euclidean distance in the experiments with some well-known time series datasets.

Their dissatisfactory performance is perhaps due to the noisy and fuzzy nature of time series data.

The mining of seqtientiai patterm [2]. .frequent epis0de.s [3 I], and partial periodic patterns [20], which are concemed with discovering event sequences (i.e., groups of events ordered by time), has been proposed in the literature. The first two techniques aim at identifying frequent event sequences whereas the third technique aims at finding event sequences, which reoccur for a period or a set of periods.

Furthermore, an approach for clustering time series has been presented in [18]. The problem of event detection, which is concerned with finding time points at which the parameters in a data model or even the model itself are changed, has been introduced in [IY]. However, these techniques are not developed for mining rules (i.e., the if-then relationships between events) in time series data.

In addition to these techniques. the mining of n- dimmsionaf inter-trmsuction association ides has been [ I  11. [231, f251, [ W .  P81, W I ,  E331, [361, 1371). They 0-7803-8353-2/04/$20.00  2004 IEEE 239 FUZZ-IEEE 2004 introduced in [30]. An n-dimensional inter-transaction association rule is concerned with the association among items from different transaction records. each of which is characterized by n ditnensional attribzites (e.g.. time, location, etc.) Two algorithms, E-Apriori and EH-Apriori, which are extensions of Apriori [I], have been proposed to deal with the huge search space. An association rule is considered interesting if its support and confidence are greater than or equal to the user-speci fied minimum siipporf and minimum co@ience, respectively. A weakness of these algorithms lies in the difficulty in deciding what these thresholds should be.

If  it is set too high. a user may miss some usefiil rules but if it is set too low, the user may be overwhelmed by many irrelevant ones [2 I],  [22].

Another approach for discovering rules in time series data has been presented in [17]. This approach first forms a set of subsequences by sliding a window through a time series and then clusters the subsequences by using a suitable measure of time series similarity, e.g., the Euclidean distance. The center of each cluster is then encoded to a sequence of primiiive dtuyes. From these sequences of primitive shapes, it mines a set of rules in the form of "if A ,  then B within time 1"' where A and B are sequences of primitive shapes. Each rule is associated with two parameters: frequency and confidence.

This approach only discovers those rules whose frequencies and confidences are greater than or equal to the user-specified minimum jrequency and niirzimirm coiiJdencc, respectively.

The discovered rules are then ranked by using the J-measure [35]. However, it can be difficult for the users to decide what the thresholds should be and the inappropriate setting can result in the neglect of some useful rules or the discovery of many irrelevant ones [21]. [22].

Recently, an information-theoretic fuzzy approach has been proposed in [29] for knowledge discovery in time series data. This approach cleans and preprocesses the time series data based on signal processing techniques. It then identifies the most useful features of the preprocessed data by constructing an information-theoretic connectionist network.

A set of rules can then be extracted from the connectionist network. The set of discovered rules is then reduced by    network. The set of discovered rules is then reduced by fkzifying the rules, reducing the set of fuaified rules by conflict resolution, and merging rules from the reduced set.

Instead of fuzzifying the crisp rules discovered in crisp data.

our approach can deal with fuzzy data and discover fuzzy rules to represent the regularities and exceptions hidden in the data.

111. THE DETAILS OF THE PROPOSED APPROACH Given a database of time series, St, ..., S,, where S, = ( ~ ~ 1 ,  .... s,,&amp; s,, E [f,, 4 E 93, i = 1, ..., n, j = 1, .... w.

such that s,, is the value of SI at time fi, each SI is classified into one of the predefiied classes, CI. . . ., C",. The proposed approach mines a set of fuzzy rules in SI, . . ., S, and classify an unseen time series using the discovered rules.

A Fiizqv Sets We define a set of fuuy  sets over [ I , ,  iz] c_ 91, which is the domain of each s,,, i E { I ,  ..., n). J E { I ,  ..., w } .  Let us denote Ihe fuzzy sets as Fk, k = 1, ..., h. The membership function ofFA is denoted as pFk and is defined as: pFk : [ I ,  7 (2 1 -+ Io, I1 The degree of membership of some value s E [II, I.] c 'Ji with some fuzzy set Fk is given by ,uFk (x) .

Using the above technique. we can represent s,, i E { I ,  . . ..

n1.j E [ I ,  ..., w), by aset offwzy sets, F =  {Fk I k =  1, ..., h ) .  Given a time series, S,, i E { I ,  ..., n} ,  and a fuzzy set, Fk E F, the degree of membership of s,, j E { I ,  . . .. tvl. in SI with respect to Fk is given by pS (s, ) .

s,, in SI can therefore be represented by a set of ordered pairs, g,,, such that: gr, = ((Ft, &amp;I). * .  - 3  (Fb. ,&amp;,d), where L I ~ , ~  = pFA (s,) ) . k = 1. . . .. h, and S, can be represented by a ftrzzy time series, GI, such that: G, = (g,i3 .. . , g1,, 1.

Let be a subset of integers such that = (il, .... . j r ) , wherej,, . . . , J r  E { 1, ,. ., i t s ) ,  j ,  f . .. # j,., and = r 2 1. W e further suppose that glco = {g,, 1 .j E q}. Given any g,, it  is associated with a set of fuzzy sets, Fw, p 2 f ,  .... h'. Each Fg, is defined by a set of fuzzy sets. fr', I (FL, ,ul,k) E g,, A , j  E p A k E { 1, . . ., h } } .  The degree to which G, is characterizcd by Fcv, pFT ( G I )  , IS defined as: /lfw(G~)=lnin(biy&amp; I ( F L  r p i j k ) E g q ( 1 ' ) For any fuzzy time series GI, i E { I ,  ..., n ) ,  let degFwc,, (GI ) be the degree to which GI is characteriLed by the fuzzy set Fw and the class label C,,, q E ( I ,  .... tn} .

The Fuzzy Dura Mining Algorithm It is important to note that a fuzzy rule can be of different orders. A first-order fuzzy rule can be defined lo be a rule involving one fuzzy set in its antecedent; a second-order rule can be defined to have two; and a third-order rule can be defined to have three fuzzy sets, etc. Our approach is given in Fig. 1.

RI = {first-order hazy rules); for (d= 2; IRd-lI f 9, dt- f) do begin T =  (each fitzzy set in the antecedent of 1 1 I E R,I I}; for all p composed of d elements in T do begin forallC,,qE { 1  ...., m ) d o begin calculate u ~ + ~ , - ~  using (3);    calculate u ~ + ~ , - ~  using (3); if interesring(F,,, C,) then R,) = Rd v i^ulegeri(Fw, C,); end end end K = U R d  ; d Fig. 1 .  Thc funy data mining algonthm To mine interesting first-order rules, our approach makes use of an objective interestingness measure introduced in Section I1I.C below. After these rules are discovered, they are stored in RI (Fig. I ) ,  Rules in RI  are then used to generate second-order rules that are then stored in R2. Rz is then used to generate third-order rules that are stored in R3 and so on for 4th and higher order. Our approach iterates until no higher order rule can be found.

The function, interessting(Fqp, Cq), computes an objective measure to determine whether the association between Fw and C, is interesting. If interesting(l;;,, C,) returns true. a fw.zy rule is then generated by the nrlegm function. For each rule generated, this function also returns an uncertainty measure associated with the rule (see Section 1JI.D). All fuzzy rules generated by rulegen arc stored in X that will then be used later for prediction or for the user to examine.

C. Discovering hateresting Rules in Fuzzy Time Series In order to decide whether an association between a fuzzy set, FGp, and a class label, C, is interesting, we determine whether (4) q=l is significantly different from h? m where M = 7, oFVCg . I f  this is the case. we consider the p=l q-1 association between Fw and C, interesting.

The significance of the difference can be objectively evaluated based on the idea of the u&amp;sted residual [ 151, [ 161 defined as: where zI.? c, is the stundurdized raiduul given by; w Y (7) ec7,cq is the sum of degrees to which time series are expected to be characterized by FR) and C,, which is calculated by: and Y ~ , , ~ ,  is the maximum likelihood estimate of the variance of zF and is computed by: R P Y Since d, has a standard normal distribution [3], if I dT7,cg /&gt; 1.96 (the 95 percentiles ofthe normal distribution),  we c m  conclude that the discrepancy between Pr(F, I C,J and Pr(C,) is significantly different and that the association between Fyp and C; is interesting.

?7, 4 24 1 F UZZ-IEEE 2004 In addition, if dFpcq &gt; +1.96 the presence of Fq implies the presence of C,. In other words, it is more likely for a time series having both F ,  and C,. On the other hand, if dFwc9 &lt; - 1.96 , the presence of F,, implies the absence of C,.

In other words, it is less likely for a time series having Fwt and Cy at the same time.

D. The lincertainty Meiisure we can form the following fuzzy rule: Given that the association between F+? and C, is interesting, where wF is the wight  of evidence [15], [I61 that is defined as follows.

Since the association between Fq, and C, is interesting, there is some evidence for a time series to be characterized by Cy given it has Fw The weight of evidence is defined in terms of an information-theoretic measure known as mutual    terms of an information-theoretic measure known as mutual hfurmafion. It measures the change of uncertainty about the presence of C, in a time series given that it has FcT is, in tum.

defined as: W Y Based on mutual information, the weight of evidence is defined in [ 151, [ 161 as: "Fq,Cq = I(C, : Fg,) - /(U(C, : FqJ) I** wF can be interpreted intuitively as a measure of the difference in the gain in information when a time series with F,, characterized by C, and when characterized by other class labels. The weight of evidence can be used to measure the significance or importance of fuzzy rules.

E, Classi3ing Unseen Time Series Using i;iizz.v Rules Given a time series, d = (a,, . . .. a,,), where a, E [ l , ,  1.1 % , j =  1 , .  . . , IV, d can be represented by a fuzzy time series, d' = (PI, ..., ,&amp;), where P, is a set of order pairs, [(F, , p6 (a ,  )), . .., (Ft,, pFh (a ,  ) )) , j  = 1, . . ., w'. The class of d is given by the class of d'. For any combination of values. &amp;, of d', it is characterized by a fuzzy set, FcT,. to a degree of compatibility, p F  , ( d ' )  , for each p E (1, ..., hr) .  Given those rules implying the assignment of C,?, Fw = C, [wFWcLt 1, for all p E &lt;c f I ,  . ... h'}, the evidence for such assignment is given by: w q P . i Suppose that, of the w values, only some combinations of them, f i l l ,  ..-) fi,], ..., pi,,] with pi,l = (P, l j  E {l .  .... w &gt; }  are found to match one or more rules, then the overall weight of ebidence for the time series to be assigned to C, is given by: i=l d belongs to class C, if coCY 2 wc, , i f q.

1V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, we applied it to several well-known time series datasets. They are artificial problems used by several researchers in the context of time series classification.

A. The Dutusets The Control Chart Dataset. It was used for evaluating the performance of classification and clustering algorithms [4], [SI. The dataset contains 600 time series, each of which consists of 60 time points and is classified into one of the six possible classes.

It was introduced in [I21 for  evaluating ciassification algorithms. The dataset contains 5,000 time series; each is composed of 21 time points and is classified into one of the three possible classes.

It was the same as the Wnwjbrm dataset. but 19 random points w,ith mean = 0 and variance = 1 were added to the end of each time series.

B. The Resiifts Since the membership functions of fitzzy sets can profoundly affect the performance of the classification models discovered, they have to be determined carefully.

The membership functions can be either determined by human experts or generated directly from data. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach in an objective manner, we decided to generate the membership functions of the fuzzy sets used in our experiments using the j k ~  c- means (FCM) algorithm [IO] instead of having human experts to determine them. The FCM algorithm is a well- known fuzzy clustering algorithm. which allows a datum in a dataset to partially belong to multiple clusters. We applied the FCM algorithm to each of the time series datasets to generate the membership functions of the fimy sets. Based on the fiizzy sets generated, each time series in the dataset was then transformed to a fuzzy time series.

After the data transformation, we divided each of the datasets into a training set. which contained 90% of the time series, and a test set. which contained the remaining time    series. We then mined a set of fuzzy rules in the training set The Waveform Dataset.

The Waveform-Noise Dataset.

25-29 July, 2004 Budapest, Hungary 1 Dataset and used the rules to classify the time series in the test set.

To facilitate the comparison, we also applied C4.5 [34], a well-known decision tree based algorithm, and the 1-Nearest Neighbor (I-NN) algorithm using the Euclidean distance to the datasets. The I-NN algorithm using the Euclidean distance was used because a recent study [27] showed that it outperformed many approaches proposed in the data mining literature (e.g., [6], [ I  11, [23], [25]. [26], [28], [32], [33], [36].

[37]). The performance of the proposed approach, C4.5, and the 1-NN algorithm is given in Table I.

Percentage Accuracy (Standard Deviation) Our I c4.5 I I -NN Noise Avera.ge I Approach I I CiittroiChavt I 100.0% I 90.0% 1 98.6% (4.8%) (3.2%) (7.0%) 86.9% 82.1% 84.9?4 The experimental results showed that ow approach obtained higher classification accuracy than C4.5 and the I - NN algorithm in the datasets. It is important to note that the classification accuracy of our approach and C4.5 are more or less the same in the Waveform dataset. Nevertheless. when noises were added to the dataset. which resulted in the Wavefii-m-Noise dataset, the proposed approach produced more accurate classification than C4.5. This is perhaps because of the resilience to noises of both fuzzy sets and the adjusted residual used in our approach.



V. CONCLUS~ONS In this paper, we proposed a new data mining technique to discover fiizzy rules in time series data. The fuzzy rules employ f i r q  sets to represent the revealed regularities and exceptions hidden in the data. The use of fiuzy sets allows the proposed approach to be resilient to noises hidden in the time series data. To distinguish interesting association relationships from uninteresting ones, our approach utilizes the adjusted residual analysis, which has an advantage that it does not require any user-specified thresholds.

We applied our approach to several well-known time series datasets. To facilitate the comparison, we also applied (24.5 and the ]-Nearest Neighbor algorithm to the same datasets.

The experimental results showed that tbe proposed approach achieved higher percentage accuracy than C4.5 and the 1- Nearest Neighbor algorithm in these datasets. The superior results of the proposed approach are perhaps due to the resilience to noises of both fuzzy sets and the objective interestingness measure.
