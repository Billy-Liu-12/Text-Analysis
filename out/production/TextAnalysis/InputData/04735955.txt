Abstract  In the healthcare sector Tree Finder considers CHILDHOOD  ASTHMA. It has emerged perhaps as the commonest  Chronic medical problem treated by Pediatricians all over the  world. So it needs several analysis works, which is very  important in the medical field. This system takes the  diagnosed information of Asthma patients and do various  analyses work on that. This analysis provides a good result  which is used for some decision making. What was originally  thought to be a disorder affecting only adults has emerged as  a very significant problem affecting the child?s life style and  day to day activities including schooling, sports and  recreation? The prevalence of childhood asthma in India  varies from 5-18% with the reported prevalence of 8-9% in  the city of Chennai. The prevalence of morbidity and  mortality from asthma seems to be on the rise. The evidence  for a world wide increase in asthma cases is so strong and  consistent that the trend cannot be considered artifact.

Presently there are 150 million people affected with asthma  world over. Because Asthma is a complex and heterogeneous  disease with many Phenotypic expressions through the course  of childhood, it is challenging to characterize.

1 A View on Asthma  Asthma is a chronic inflammatory lung disease that causes  airways to tighten and narrow. Anyone can have asthma,  including infants and adolescents. The tendency to develop  asthma is often inherited.

Many children with asthma can breathe normally for weeks  or months between flares. When flares do occur, they often  seem to happen without warning. Actually, an asthma flare  usually develops over time, involving a complicated process  of increasing. All children with asthma have airways that are  overly sensitive or hyper reactive to certain asthma triggers.

Things that trigger flares differ from person to person. Some  common triggers are exercise, allergies, viral infections and  smoke. The sensitive airway linings react to trigger exposure  by becoming inflamed, swollen and filled with mucus. The  muscles lining the swollen airways tighten and constrict,  making them even more narrowed and obstructed. So an  asthma flare is caused by three important changes in the  airways:  ?  Swelling of the lining of the airways  ?  Excess Mucus that results in congestion and mucus  "plugs" that get caught in the narrowed airways  ?  Bronchoconstriction: bands of smooth muscle lining the  airways tighten up.

? Together, the swelling, excess mucus and  bronchoconstriction narrow the airways and make it  difficult to move air through (like breathing through a  straw). During an asthma flare, kids may experience  coughing, wheezing (a breezy whistling sound in the  chest when breathing), chest tightness, increased heart  rate, sweating and shortness of breath.

2 Asthma Diagnosis  Diagnosing asthma can be tricky and timeconsuming because  different children with asthma can have very different  patterns of symptoms. For example, some kids cough  constantly at night but seem fine during the day, while others  seem to get frequent chest colds that don't go away. It's not  uncommon for kids to have symptoms like these for months  before being seen by a doctor. When considering a diagnosis  of asthma, a doctor rules out other possible causes of a child's              Tree Miner ? A Data Mining Tool for Asthma Patient Diagnosis System    symptoms. He or she asks questions about the family's  asthma and allergy history, performs a physical exam and  possibly orders laboratory tests such as Chest X-rays, Blood  tests and Allergy Skin tests. During this process, parents must  provide the doctor with detailed information, such as:  ?  Symptoms: how severe they are, when and where they occur, how frequently they occur, how long  they last and how they go away.

?  Allergies: the child's and the family's allergy history.

?  Illnesses: how often the child gets colds, how severe they are and how long they last.

?  Triggers: exposures to irritants and allergens, recent life changes or stressful events,other things that seem to lead to a flare.

A. Diagnosis and assessment of severity of asthma  Suspicion of asthma in all children whose presenting symptoms may suggest recurrent airflow obstruction.

Symptoms suggestive of recurrent airflow obstruction  ?  Recurrent wheeze  ?  Recurrent isolated cough  ?  Recurrent breathlessness  ?  Nocturnal cough  ?  Tightness of chest  Also Asthma is considered in the following Clinical Situations  ?  Recurrent pneumonic infiltrates in different lobes  ?  Recurrent ?lower respiratory infections?  Identification of signs that suggest generalized airflow obstruction  ? Generalized Bronchi (Type of sound in Chest)  ?  Prolonged Expiration  ?  Chest Hyperinflation  Symptoms of asthma are divided into two types. They are typical symptoms and atypical symptoms.

The symptoms of airflow obstruction are common to both typical and atypical symptoms. Rather than this airflow obstruction both typical and atypical symptoms are having different symptoms. Patients who are having the typical symptoms are definitely affected by the asthma. Patients who are having atypical symptoms may or may not be affected by asthma. Personal best - This is the value which gets from PEF Diurnal variation. PEF values are taken twice per day. The difference between these two values is called diurnal variation. The information?s in the below table shows the severity level of asthma. The high level grade of asthma shows the high severity  1) Exercise induced asthma (EIA)  Kids who have EIA develop asthma symptoms after vigorous activity such as running, swimming or biking.

2) Allergy triggered asthma  Even if a child's primary triggers are colds and flu (the most common triggers for children) or exercise, allergies can sometimes play a minor role in aggravating the condition.

3 Overview of the Tree Finder System  Let T= {t1, t2, t3? tn} be a set of labeled trees, let ? be a frequency threshold. The finder method for discovering ? - frequent trees in T is a two step algorithm. The first step is a clustering step that groups nput trees in which same pairs of labels occur together frequently enough in the ancestor relation. The second step is the tree construction step based on the computation of maximal trees that are common to all the trees of each cluster. The trees that are returned as output of this algorithm are formally characterized with respect to input.

A. Tree inclusion  Let t and t? be two labeled trees. If t is included t? if there exists a mapping f from the nodes of t into thev set of nodes of t? such that f preserves the ancestor relation:  V u in t, label (u) = label (f (u)) and V u, v in t, anc (u, v) => anc (f (u), f (v)) Here label (u) returns the label of node u and anc (u, v) returns the set of nodes, which are the ancestor of the nodes u and v.

B. Compute frequent item sets  The first step of the project is to find the frequent item sets of the XML database. XML database is naturally in hierarchical format. So the database is in the form of collection of trees.

Some nodes of the trees should be frequent item sets. If an item set is frequent it must satisfy this minimum support threshold value. Minimum support threshold value may be set by the user or by the developer automatically. Many algorithms have been developed to compute frequent item sets. The current implementation involves the well-known Apriori algorithm. Tree finder applies the Apriori algorithm to the set of transactions T over the items I identifying the pairs of labels, with the frequency threshold. Apriori employs an iterative approach known as a level wise search where k item sets are used to explore (k+1) item sets. The important property called the Apriori property is used to reduce the search space.By Apriori property any subset of a frequent item set is necessarily also a frequent item set.

(a) is an illustration of heterogeneous XML data structures with various nesting of the labels. D1 and D2 contain the labels some of which has the same label. But the nesting style is varied.

D. Clustering guided by co-occurrence of labels pairs  An abstraction of the input T= {t1?, tn}, where each ti is viewed as a transaction made of all the items l*m such that l is the label of an ancestor of a node labeled by m in ti. Each item l*m has a unique identifier. Let I be the set of those identifiers. For example, the input transaction corresponding to tree D1 of Fig.1 (a) is:  D1 = {Patient X * Recurrent Airflow Obstruction, Patient X * Factors, Patient X * Recurrent wheeze, Patient X * Nocturnal cough, Recurrent Airflow Obstruction* Factors, Recurrent Airflow  Obstruction * Recurrent wheeze, Recurrent Airflow Obstruction * Nocturnal cough, Factors* Recurrent  wheeze, Factors* Nocturnal cough} This splitting of the trees in separate items corresponding to pairs of labels breaks the tree structure but makes possible the use of a standard frequent item sets algorithm for discovering frequent label pairs in the input trees. The co-occurrence of same pairs of labels is considered as semantically significant if it occurs frequently in the input data.

4. Conclusion and Scope for Future  Development  This system is designed to find the frequent trees in the XML based database. The initial symptoms for the asthma patient whose age is between 5 to 12 years are analyzed by the software.. The typical and atypical symptoms are considered for the analysis process. The typical symptoms are identified as the actual symptoms for the Asthma. The atypical symptoms are identified as partial symptoms for asthma. The frequently occurred symptoms are extracted by this application. The severity levels for the patients are also  included in the analysis. The testing activities are carried out the sample data that are collected from a hospital. This system shows that the patients has more atypical symptoms are affected more seriously. Their severity level is higher than with other patients. Tree Finder computes an approximation of the result to ensure better scalability. This computerized method is a well-suited application for the real time activities. It posses many robust features, even though it can be expanded for additional features. For further development of this system, any other diseases can be implemented to the organization, which needs data mining operations. Tree finder uses a relaxed inclusion test, which allows for detecting trees, which are not present, verbatim in the data.
