An Association Rule-Based Bilateral Multi-Issue Negotiation Model

Abstract?In this paper, we present an association rule-based bilateral multi-issue negotiation model which uses association rules to describe the interdependence of issues. Moreover, we propose a novel time-dependent negotiation strategy which based on association rules. In the negotiation process, agent can adjust the associated issues? value intervals and negotiation time dynamically according to the corresponding association rules, thus reducing the number of interactions appropriately to improve the flexibility and efficiency of negotiation process. The experimental results show that the model can improve the overall utility and efficiency.

I. INTRODUCTION A bilateral multi-issue negotiation is an important  research topic in Multi-Agent System (MAS) and the research of negotiation model usually based on the multi- attribute utility theory [1]. For traditional models which based on agenda [2] and case [3], they didn?t consider the dependence among each issue. However, in the actual negotiation process, this interdependence often existed and doubtless it increased the complexity of bilateral multi-issue negotiation. In recent years, researchers have also proposed solutions to solve this problem. For example, introducing an approximation approach [4] or a Simulated Annealing optimization method [5] is to tackle the complexity problem of negotiation with interdependent issues. Robu et.al.[6] proposed a negotiation model which based on utility graph that describes the interdependence and reduces the complexity of negotiation through collaborative filtering[7] [8]. However, each issue only has the two values 0 or 1.

Gonzales et.al.[9] used generalized additive independence (GAI) networks to represent the interdependence of issues, but when the value interval of issue is continual or the value space is even large, the practical application of GAI-based models will be limited. These problems that result from utility graph-based model and GAI-based model can be solved in this paper. We propose an association rule-based bilateral multi-issue negotiation model which introduces the rule generation mechanism (RGM) to analyze the successful records from negotiations history. Then, constructing the association rule base and uses association rules to represent the interdependence of issues. According to the association rules agent can adjust the associated issues? value range and  negotiation time dynamically, thus improving the flexibility and efficiency of negotiation.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: firstly, we describe a bilateral negotiation model which based on association rules; secondly, we present a rule generation mechanism; thirdly, we give a novel negotiation strategy by combining time-dependent strategy with association rules; and finally, we verify model?s feasibility and effectiveness by experiment.



II. BILATERAL MULTI-ISSUE NEGOTIATION MODEL The formal description of ARNM (An Association Rule-  based Negotiation Model) defined as follow: ARNM=<A, Tall, I, V, RGM, S, P>  A represents the set of Agent, assuming A= {b, s}, Agents is a seller and Agentb is a buyer.

Tall represents agent?s negotiation time, and the time of negotiation process is determined by the Agent whose negotiation time is shorter.

I  represents the set of issues which each issue?s attributes always include: weight, value interval and corresponding negotiation time, etc. assuming { }1, , nI I I= , jiI  represents the ith issue of Agentj which defined as a tuple as follows:  , , ,j j j j ji i i i iI w D X T=< > Where jiw is the weight of issue i, 0<  j iw <1 and  1 1 n j i iw= = ;  j iD is the value interval of issue i and  {[j ji iD LV=  , ] | , } j  iHV i I j A? ? , where j  iLV is the minimum acceptable value for Agentj, jiHV is the maximum acceptable value for Agentj; { | , }j ji iX x i I j A= ? ?  is a set of counter-offer, which belongs to issue I and  j j i ix D? ? ,  j ix is a counter-offer of issue i which is generated  by Agentj; jiT is the corresponding time of issue i which belongs to Agentj, *j j ji i allT w T=  and 1  n j j i i allT T= = .

V represents utility evaluation mechanisms. Assuming Agentj makes an evaluation for jix  is ( )  j j i iV x . If evaluation  values are increased by counter-offers jix , then ( ) j j  i iV x  is defined according to equation (1):  ( ) , , j j  j j i i i i j j  i i  x LV V x i I j A  HV LV ?  = ? ? ?  . (1)  2011 Fourth International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Design  DOI 10.1109/ISCID.2011.160     If evaluation values are decreased by counter-offers jix , then ( )j ji iV x  is defined according to equation (2):  ( ) , , j j  j j i i i i j j  i i  HV x V x i I j A  HV LV ?  = ? ? ?  . (2)  According to the above equations (1) and (2), the Agent?s overall utility U is defined according to equation (3): }{ 1 * ( ) | ,n j j ji i i iU w V x i I j A== ? ? . (3)  P represents the negotiation protocol. The negotiation process adapts bargaining interactive mode. The abbreviation placed next as: rule generation mechanism (RGM) and the same as above negotiation strategy(S) will be discussed respectively in the following sections.



III. RULE GENERATION MECHANISM In bilateral multi-issue negotiation process, the values of  issues may be interdependent. For example, two issues (price and delivery time). In the actual negotiation process when the price is higher, the delivery time may be shorter, whereas the delivery time may be longer. Therefore assuming  j? represents a subset of jI , j jI?? ? and  j n j  set setI == ? . , , ,[ , ] j j j i sub i sub i subd lv hv< > < > < >= is the value  subinterval of issue i, and 1 , j n j  i sub i subD d= < >= , , j i subd< >?  j iD? ,where sub is just an identifier of each subinterval.

Using above assumptions, given 1 2 3, , j j j j s s s I?? ? ? ? (s1, s2,  s3 are different identifier of j? ), the characters of interdependence of issues are defined according to the following definitions: Def.1 (Interdependence): if issues belong to 2  j s? , whose  values depend on these issues in 1 j s? , then we define that  j s?  is dependent on 1  j s?  and use 1 2|  j j s s? = ?  to represent the  association between 1 j s?  and 2  j s?  for 1  j j i sI? ? ? , we define  j iI  as a decisional issue and the corresponding value  subintervals are defined as decisional value subintervals. At the same time, for ' 2  j j i sI? ? ?  we define '  j iI  as an associated  issue and the corresponding value subintervals are defined as associated value subintervals. If 2  j s?  is independent on 1  j s? ,  we use 1 2| j j s s? ? ?  to represent this relationship.

Def.2 (Association Rule): Given 1 2| j j s s? = ? , 1  j j i sI? ? ?  and  ' 2 j j  i sI? ? ? , the set of association rule ? , which generated by 1 '|  j j s iI? = , is defined according to equation (4):   '  1 , ', '| ( )j j  i i  j n j j i i sub i subI  d d= < > < >? =? = ? ? . (4)  Where 1 , 1, , n j j j i i sub sub n subd d d= < > < > < >? = ? ? represents the set  of decisional value subintervals and ', ' j i subd< >  represents the  corresponding associated value subinterval; n is the number of issues in 1  j s? .

Assuming ? is denoted as the set of association rule between subsets of I, so  1 2|s s j ? =??  represents the association  rule set, which generated by 1 2| j j s s? = ? .Given 1  j j i sI? ? ?  ,  ' 2 j j  i sI? ? ? and combining with Def.2, 1 2|s s j ? =??  defined  according to equation (5): { }  1 2 1 ' ' 1| |  ,j j j j s s s i  j n j i I  j A=? =? ? =? = ? ? . (5)  Where n is the number of issues in 2 j s? . According to  equation (5), the association rule base defined according to equation (6): 1 ', , ( | )  j n j j j s sRules j A  ? ? ? ?  = == ? ? ? ? = ? ? .  (6)  Where s and s? are identifiers of different subset.

To achieve the construction of association rule base  according to the interdependence of issues, we adapt K- Means algorithm to analyze the successful negotiation records from history. After cluster analyzing, we can get a number of associated data clusters, which are used to generate the corresponding rules. In this way, we initially build the association rule base. Where K-Means algorithm uses distance as the similarity evaluation. For example, calculating the distance between multi-dimensional data points p(1)(p1(1), p2(1),?, pn(1)) (n is the number of dimensions) and p(2)(p1(2), p2(2),?, pn(2)) defined according to equation(7):  ( ) 1(1) (2) (1) (2)1( , ) ( )n i i iidis p p p p ? ???= ? . (7) Where  represents the weight of attribute; in the proposed model, let =2, we use the Euclidean distance calculation and cluster each data object to the corresponding cluster.

And K-Means algorithm uses squared error criterion function  cE as a cluster criterion, cE  defined as equation (8):    1 j k  c j p C jE p pivot= ?= ? .  (8) Where k is the number of clusters; p is the data object which belongs to the corresponding data cluster Cj; pivotj represents the center object of Cj. This iteration process repeated until each data object belongs to a particular cluster and the cE does not change or become less than a certain threshold.

Through the above cluster analysis, we have initially built the rule base, but there maybe exist some redundant or unreasonable association rules in the rule base. Therefore, for further optimizing of the rule base, the calculation rules of association rules are defined according to the following definitions (mainly for unitary interdependence of issues): Def.2.1 (Extendibility Rule): Given rules ,(  j j i subd? < >? = ?  '', ' | )  i i  j j i sub I Id< > =? ? , the corresponding associated value  subinterval is ', ' ', ' ', '[ , ] j j j i sub i sub i subd lv hv< > < > < >=  and the value  interval of issue i? is ' ' '[ , ] j j j  i i iD LV HV= . Therefore, according to the utility evaluation mechanism, we can extend the minimum or maximum of ? ?s associated value subinterval, if the evaluation values are increased by counter- offers(equation(1)), then the association value subinterval will be extended as ', ' ', ' '[ , ]  j j i sub i sub id lv HV< > < >= ; if the  evaluation value is decreased by counter-offers(equation(2)),     then the association value subinterval will be extended as ', ' ' ', '[ , ]  j j i sub i i subd LV hv< > < >= .

Assuming '1 2 |  , i i  j j j I I? ? =? ? ? , and 1 , 1 ', '1  j j j i sub i subd d? < > < >= ? ,  whose decisional value subinterval is , 1 , 1[ j j i sub i subd lv< > < >=  , 1, ] j i subhv< > and the corresponding associated value  subinterval is ', '1 ', '1 ', '1[ , ] j j j i sub i sub i subd lv hv< > < > < >= ; 2 , 2  j j i subd? < >=  ', ' 2 j i subd< >? , whose decisional value subinterval is , 2  j i subd< > =  , 2 , 2[ , ] j j i sub i sublv hv< > < > and the corresponding associated value  subinterval is ', '2 ', ' 2 ', ' 2[ , ] j j j i sub i sub i subd lv hv< > < > < >= . So, the  combinability rule and adjustability rule are defined as follows: Def.2.2 (Combinability Rule): When the associated value subinterval ', '1 ', ' 2  j j i sub i subd d< > < >= , we can combine 1  j?  with 2 j?  to generate a rule 3 , 1 , 2 ', '1{ } j j j j  i sub i sub i subd d d? < > < > < >= ? .

Def.2.3 (Adjustability Rule): When the evaluation values are increased by counter-offers (equation (1)) and ', '1  j i sublv< > <  ', ' 2 j i sublv< > , if , 1 , 2  j j i sub i sublv lv< > < >? , then adjust 2  j? ?s associated value subinterval to ', '2 ', '1 ', ' 2[ , ]  j j j i sub i sub i subd lv hv< > < > < >= ; if  , 2 j i sublv< >  , 1 , 2  j j i sub i sublv hv< > < >< ? , then adjust 2  j? ?s decisional value subinterval to , 2 , 2 , 1[ , )  j j j i sub i sub i subd lv lv< > < > < >= . When the  evaluation values are decreased by counter-offers (equation (2)) and ', '1 ', ' 2  j j i sub i subhv hv< > < >< , if , 1 , 2  j j i sub i sublv lv< > < >? , then  adjust 1 j? ?s associated value subinterval to  ', '1 ', '1 ', ' 2[ , ] j j j i sub i sub i subd lv hv< > < > < >= ; if , 1 , 2  j j i sub i sublv lv< > < >< ?  , 1 j i subhv< > ,  then adjust 1  j? ?s decisional value subinterval to  , 1 , 1 , 2[ , ) j j j i sub i sub i subd lv lv< > < > < >= .

In summary, the rule generation mechanism (RGM)  consists of 2 parts: the first part, cluster analysis algorithm used to analyze the successful negotiation records from history to initialize the association rule base; the second part, using the calculation rules to merge and optimize the association rules for further perfect the construction of the association rule base.



IV. NEGOTIATION STRATEGY In the proposed model, time-dependent strategy  combined with association rules to present an association rule-based time-dependent strategy. Usually time-dependent strategy [10] can be divided into three types: Boulware, Linear and Conceder. The corresponding time-dependent function  (t) defined according to equation (9):   ( ) (1 )( )j j j ji  i  tt T  ? ? ? ?= + ? . (9)  Where  is a const,  is a time-dependent factor; assuming ( )jix t  is a counter-offer, which is generated by Agentj at  time t ( jit T? ), using equation (9). Therefore ( ) j  ix t  defined according to equation (10):   ( )  ( ) (1 ( ))  j j j i i ij  i j j j i i i  LV t D x t  LV t D ?  ? +  = + ?  . (10)  Where j j ji i iD HV LV= ? represents the length of value interval of issue i. Assuming t<sub> is the corresponding negotiation time for the associated value subinterval d=[lv, hv]. So, ,  j i subt< > represents issue i?s, in Agentj, negotiation  time of the corresponding value subinterval and 1 ,  n j j sub i sub it T= < > = , ,  j i subt< >  defined as equation (11):  ,, *j ji i subj  i sub j i  T d t  D < >  < > = . (11)  Where , j j j i sub i id hv lv< > = ?  represents the length of associated  value subinterval of issue i. Using equation (10) and equation (11), the association rule-based time-dependent strategy defined according to equation (12) where ( ' ,  j i subt t< >? ):   '  ,' '  ,  ( ) ( )  (1 ( ))  j j j i i i subj  i j j j i i i sub  lv t d x t  lv t d ?  ? < >  < >  + =  + ? . (12)  According to the corresponding association rules and when the decisional issues are negotiated successfully, we can adjust the associated issues? negotiation value subinterval and negotiation time (equation (11)) dynamically. Then we can generate counter-offers for the given time by using (equation (12)).



V. MODEL ANALYSIS AND EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS The simulation model was implemented by Eclipse  platform for achieving the interaction of bilateral multi-issue negotiation process. The comparison model is ANM (an Agenda-based Negotiation Model), which adapts the thought from the literature [2] and neglects the interdependence of issues. Assuming the set of issues I= {price, delivery time, quality time} in which the value of delivery time and the value of quality time are dependent on the value of price. At the same time we assume each issue?s value interval is continuous and the corresponding weight is W= {0.4, 0.2, 0.4}. This discussion focuses on seller, so the seller?s parameters are set as follows: price= [3000, 4500], delivery time= [3, 15], quality time= [180,720], =0.1 and Tall=300.

Finally, we set K-Means parameter k=20. Before starting negotiation, seller have learned offline with 11500 successful history records, the rule sets PDRules generated by price and delivery time and PSRules generated by price and quality time are showed in TABLE I. :( By using the calculation rules (Def.2.1, Def.2.2 and Def.2.3) defined in RGM)  TABLE I.

VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK In this paper, we presented an association rule-based  bilateral multi-issue negotiation model (ARNM): first, ARNM model uses K-Means algorithm to analyze the successful records from negotiations history and uses the defined rule generation mechanism (RGM) to complete the construction of association rule base; second, an association rule-based time-dependent strategy was proposed by combining the time-dependent strategy and association rules together; finally, the ARNM model?s feasibility and effectiveness were verified by experimental model. In future, first, some improvement to the overall utility of the negotiation process will be considered by using another strategy and second, the generation and representation of multi-variable association rules (an issue?s value depends on several issues? values) need further study.
