The Analysis on Course Grade of College-wide Examination Based on Mixed

Abstract-Taking grades of computer cultural foundation course  as example, the weighted association rules algorithm have been  used to analyze grades of college-wide examination course in  this paper, giving the model and mining method of mixed  weighted association rules on grade database. Compared to  directly apply the Apriori algorithm, more valuable  correlations have been obtained between the chapters, chapters  and scores, colleges and chapters at the same threshold values.

Thus, it is more helpful to guide teachers for their teaching and  for the improvement of teaching quality.

I. INTRODUCTION  With the rapidly developing of database technology,  extensive application of database management system and  increasing capability of obtaining data of people,  applications are processing an increasing amount of data in  database. It is becoming increasingly important to discovery  some implied and valuable information to guide people for  their study and work. The technology of data mining could  discover useful knowledge from mass data, so it has been  broadly applied in various fields. Meanwhile, it is  extraordinary meaningful that data mining is applied in  course teaching of college to discover much of implicit  information which can guide teachers for their teaching and  be helpful to provide effective supports for reform decision  of teaching.



II. INTRODUCTION OF ASSOCIATION RULES  Association rule is an implication of the form A :::/ B ,  where A , Be l  , and A n B =:p , the sets of items (for  short itemsets) A and B are called antecedent (Ieft-hand-side  or LHS) and consequent (right-hand-side or RHS) of the rule  respectively. Let 1= {i], h"', im} be a set of m binary  attributes called items. Let D= {t], t2 ... , to} be a set of    transactions called the database. Each transaction in D has a  unique transaction ID and contains a subset of the items in I.

The support of an itemset A is defined as the proportion of  transactions in the data set which contain the itemset.

Confidence of the rule A :::/ B is interpreted as the percentage  of transactions that contain B among transaction that contain  A, association rule mining is the discovery of all association  rules that are above a user-specified minimum support and  minimum confidence.

Apriori was proposed by R.Agrawal and R.Srikant[l] in  1994, which is an influential algorithm for mining frequent  itemsets for Boolean association rules. This algorithm uses a  level-wise search, where k-itemsets are used to explore  (k+1)-itemset, to mine frequent itemsets from transactional  database. However, Apriori assumed that items and  transactions had the same significance without taking  account of items weights within a transaction and  transactions attributes in the database. But this is not always  the case. In order to give expression to different attentions  between items, between transactions, the introduction of item  and transaction weight from many experts with the following  time. For example, MNW AL (0) and MNW AL (W)  algorithms were proposed by C.H .. Cai and his partners [2].



III. THE ANALYSIS BASED ON GRADES OF  COMPUTER CULTURAL FOUNDATION UNIFIED  EXAMINATION COURSE  As a compulsory course, a unified Web-based testing  platform has been applied to test students from each college  and obtain their grades of computer cultural foundation.

Each student extracts a paper randomly from two kinds of  papers with equivalent difficulty. The same type of questions  and scores distribution present in the two kinds of papers.

Each paper contains theory and practice questions, where  single choice is theory question, practice part contains  questions of windows, network, word, excel, powerpoint and  access. The full marks is 240 in the paper, where single  choice has 120 points, questions of windows have 15,  network have 20, excel have 20, power point and access are  optional questions, each holds 20 points. The platform could  automatically statistic points of questions, scores of every  student and number of student in different score level, the  final information would export as excel format for each    college. Obviously, this information doesn't nearly enough  to guide teachers for their teaching. Except teaching  experience of themselves, possibly, there have some other  relations in chapters. Furthermore, which chapter's score is  the most effective of the total points? To obtain more  correlation information, the scores of students from ten  colleges have been extracted as samples to analysis  association rules. In sequence, they are college of  Mathematic Science, Electronic engineering, Physics and  technology, Education science, Economics and management,  Law, Foreign studies, Physical culture, Music, File art.

IV. MIXED WEIGHTED ASSOCIATION RULES  MODELING BASED ON SCORES OF COLEGE-WIDE  EXAMINA nON  A. The characteristic and weighted problem of computer  cultural foundation grades database  In terms of computer cultural foundation course, teachers  pay different attention to grades of colleges, moreover,  questions of chapters in test papers have different difficulty.

On one hand, it must be considered that transactions are  viewed with different importance in database; on the other  hand, items have the different significance within a  transaction. So vertical weighted and horizontal weighted  must be considered simultaneously in this database.

B. Vertical weighted association rules  Similar to [3], given a test grades database with a set of  transactions D, let 1= {i1' i2"., im} be a set of m distinct items.

Given an itemset X, X!:': I, if it contains the items which  weighted is Vi, then define the vertical weighted support of  X by  f ( v  ,Count ( X ,  sup v ( X  ) = --'.'-=---,--1 ------Nv  (1)  Where Count (Xi) is the number of transactions that  contain X in colleges, and Ny is the weighted transaction  number:  N" = f (v,N,)  i=l (2)  Where Ni is the number of transactions m college of  number i.

If the vertical weighted support of itemset X is not less  than the Wminsup threshold, or SUpy(X) ?Wminsup, while  Wminsup is minimum vertical weighted support, it is called  vertical weighted frequent itemset.

Vertical weight concept was mentioned by Lu et al.[3]  and Yu et al.[4] mainly applied in two ways. One way is that  vertical weight support is weighted by time interval; the  other way is weighted by different importance in same kind  of objects. The latter way has been used in this paper,  vertical weight support is weighted by colleges. In terms of  computer cultural foundation course, which always constrain  improvement of average scores of the whole students are the  scores from college of Physical culture, Music, File art. As a  result, teachers pay more attention to grades of students from  these colleges than from other colleges, such as college of  Mathematic Science. Therefore, the transactions whose  college is the former three colleges have been weighted  heavily.

C. Horizontal weighted association rules  Given an itemset I= {i], i2,"', ik} , a weight Wj has been  assigned for each item ij, with 0 ? Wj ? 1 where  j={1,2, ". ,k} , to show the importance of the item. Then  define the horizontal weighted support of A by  sup heX) = max{ hl'h2, ... hm}sup( X) (3)  where SUPh(X) is support of X, k is the number of items  in itemset, max {h],h2,'" ,hd is named horizontal weight of  X, marked as hx, while O?hx? l.

If SUPh(X) ? Wminsup, X is called horizontal weighted  frequent itemset, where Wminsup is minimum horizontal  weighted support.

Horizontal weighted association rules were applied in [2],  authors assumed that items have unequal importance in  database, whereas the difficulty of questions take on  difference in scores database in this paper. For example,  obviously, questions of windows are easier than questions of  excel and access. As we know, there are some correlations  between chapters in a course. In order to help students grasp  faster and better of those difficult chapters, it must be known  that which easier chapters may helpful for learning of those  difficulties. Only if teachers hold the relevancy between  chapters can help their teaching more efficiently. To obtain  more relevant information between questions of difficulty    and easiness, the former questions have been weighted  heavier in the horizontal weights.

D. Mixed weighted association rules  More generally, both vertical weights for colleges and  horizontal weights for questions have been assigned to mine  rules in college-wide examination grade database, which are  defined as mixed weighted problem.

Given D as a database and an itemset I={i], i2,"', im} ,  firstly, a vertical weight Vi has been assigned, with O?vi?l,  for each college interval Ci, where i={l ,2; "n} . Vi is set to  weight of transactions which college is Ci. Then assign a  horizontal weight hi for each question, with O?hj?l, where  j={l,2, '" ,m} , meanwhile, items have been sorted of an  ascending sequence by their horizontal weights, thus the  mixed weighted support of X has been defined by  f (viCount (Xi  sup m(X) = hx sup ,, ( x ) = max{ h"h" ... , hk} -,,'?=,-l ____ _ Nv  (4)  Where hx is horizontal weight of X, the notation such as  Count (XD, Ny has been explained in section B.

If the mixed weighted support of itemset X is not less  than the Wminsup threshold, or supm(X) ?Wminsup, where  Wminsup is minimum mixed weighted support, it is called  mixed weighted frequent itemset.

Mixed weighted confidence of rule X => Y has been  defined by  if ( X Y) =  sup m (X u Y) . con m => sup m (X )  (5)  A rule X => Y is called a frequent mixed weighted  association rule if Xu y is a frequent mixed weighted  V14-531   itemset and the confidence of the rule is larger than or equal  to the Wminconf, where Wminconf is minimum mixed  weighted confidence.

. Discussion on properties of itemset with vertical  weighted, horizontal weighted and mixed weighted  There have two lemmas are used to reduce the number of  candidates in algorithm of Apriori [1]:  One is that if an itemset is large, then all its subsets must  be large; the other is that if an itemset is small, all its    supersets must be small. Obviously, the lemmas are fit for all  vertical weighted itemsets. For example, let A be a large  vertical weighted itemset, then supvCA) ?Wminsup, Let B  be a subset of A, then have I.Cv, CCountCB,))) ?

1=1

I. Cv,CCountCA,) )  ,thus we also can find supvCB) ?supvCA)  i=l  ? Wminsup, as a result, itemset B is a large vertical  weighted itemset too. The similar proof that condition is that  A is a small vertical weighted itemset, ACB, then B must be  small.

But horizontal weighted itemsets do not agree with the  two lemmas. The reason is that it is indefinitely to decide  which value is more greater between sUPhCB) and sUPh(A).

Thus, not all of subsets of horizontal weighted frequent  itemset are frequent. And not all of supersets of horizontal  weighted infrequent itemset are infrequent.

The mixed weighted support has been treated as a  vertical weighted support with horizontal weighted factor.

From above discussions, we discover that the two lemmas do  not work for mixed weighted itemsets. So that mixed  weighted algorithms are different from Apriori algorithm.



V. THE DESCRIPTION OF MIXED WEIGHTED  ASSOCIATION RULES ALGORITHM  Inputs: A database 0 with the transactions T, where each  item has vertical weight and horizontal weight, two threshold  values Wminsup and Wminconf.

Outputs: A sets of mixed weighted rules (include the  weighted support and confidence).

Step 1: Scan the entire transaction database 0, find out the  large l-itemsets C1 in that database.

Step2: Calculate the mixed weighted support of each  item, reserve the item which weighted support is equal or  greater than Wminsup, and then add all these items to  frequent 1-itemsets L1  Step3: While k?2, candidate k-itemsets Ck are generated  by Ck-1 conjoin itself, then calculate mixed weighted support  of item sets in Ck.

Step4: Prune away the small itemsets (was defined in [1])  in Ck, drop itemset which mixed weighted support is lower  than Wminsup, add the left to Lk, finally, combine with all  the Lk.

StepS: If there is an existing itemset A in Lk,  and A  =  B u C , then calculate the value of confm (B ? C) ,  reserve the rule such as B ? C which value is greater or  equal than Wminconf.

Step6: Output all the mixed weighted rules such  1ikeB? c.



VI. THE MINING SAMPLES AND ANALYSIS ON  CONSEQUENCE OF MIXED WEIGHTED  ASSOCIATION RULES BASED ON COLLEGE-WIDE  EXMINATION COURSE GRADE  Convenient for mining, the score of each question has  been divided into three sections which contains excellent,  average, weak. Meanwhile, made a certain notation for each  section, and then use the notation instead of the score in the  corresponding section. Taking score of windows for example,  windows have IS points, the score has been divided into  three sections: if it is not only greater or equal than 13, but  also equal or lower than IS ,or scoreE[13,IS], which is  defined excellent part, make 0 instead of the scores in this  part; Similarly, score E [9,13) which is defined average part,  use E instead of the scores in that part; score E [0,9) which is  defined weak part, and use F instead of the scores in the part.

The score of network, word, excel, optional have been  divided into three sections, which apply the same approach,  where powerpoint and access questions as a questions of  optional, and the greater points of power point and access as  optional grades. The detail corresponding relations between  sections of questions and notations are shown in table 1.

In sequence, the notations of colleges of  Mathematic Science, Electronic engineering, Physics and    technology, Education science, Economics and management,  Law, Foreign studies, Physical culture, Music, File art are  0,1,2,3,4,S,6,7,8,9. The vertical weights of ten colleges Vi set  as following: Vo:O.l; VJ:O.l; V2:O.l; V3:0.6; V4:O.S; Vs:O.S;  V6:0.6; V7:O.9; Vs:0.9; V9:O.9. The horizontal weights of  questions hj set as following: Windows (hl):0.3; Network  (h2):0.4; Word (h3):0.6; Excel (?):0.7; Optional (hs):0.9.

The following list of ten transactions (as shown in table  II) are to explain mixed weighted association rules mining  algorithm.

Where H _weight is abbreviation of Horizontal weight,  V_weight is abbreviation of Vertical weight.

Applied mixed weights in college computer cultural  foundation grades database, with Wminsup=30% and  Wminconf=60%, the following interesting two rules have  been extracted from the database.

The second rule shows that the students who get weak grades  in word and optional, also get weak grades in the excel  questions, and the mixed weighted support of this rule is    33%, confidence is 90%. However, the rules relevant to  excel by using Apriori algorithm can not be found at the  same thresholds.

And then, add score of single choice, the total score of  student and the college as horizontal weighted items to  transaction database, furthermore, 0.5, 1.2 and 1 have been  assigned to the items in sequence. Other items' weights are  the same as above setting. Score of single choice has been  divided into three sections in the same way, and a certain  notation has been assigned to each part. Also total score has  been treated in the same way. In sequence, use notation A, B  and C instead of scores in excellent, average and weak  sections for single-choice questions, X, Y and Z for total  score. With Wminsup=20% and Wminconf=30%, the  following valuable rules have been discovered in the  database:  9 ? CCW sup = 27%, Wcan! = 38%)  9 ? L(W sup = 27%, Wean! = 39%)  9 ? O( W sup = 27%, Wean! = 69%)  9 ? Z(W sup = 27%, Weanf = 83%)  Then set Wminsup=50% and Wminconf=80%, the rules  have been extracted from the database:  o u Z ? T(W sup = 53%, Wearif = 87%)  O u T  ? C(W sup = 78%, Wean! = 100%)  Analyzing of the first four rules can discover that  students from college of File art get the worst score in  optional questions. Only if teachers strengthen the teaching  of this chapter can improve average of the college, thereby  improving average of the university. From later two rules,  we can find that grades of excel, optional and single choice  have closer relationship with total score than other scores of  questions. But if apply Apriori to mining rules in the  transaction database and only if minimum support is  decreased to 5%, rules relation with colleges can be obtained.

Moreover, the last rule with 48% support and 95%  confidence can be obtained by using Apriori. Obviously,  using mixed weighted association rules algorithm improves  the support and confidence of rules, and makes them be  discovered easier.



VII. CONCLUSION  This paper takes college computer cultural foundation  course grade database as example, applies mixed weighted    association rules algorithm to obtain some importance and  valuable information according to characteristic of the  database, such as the correlations of chapters, and the factors  influence total score of students. The information has  reference value for teaching, and is helpful to improve  learning efficiency of students. Ultimately, the average  scores of the students are improved. Similarly, the approach  of analysis in scores of computer foundation course database  can also be applied in other college examination course  grade database, such like college English test grades  database, principles of Marxist philosophy test scores  database and so on. In addition, application in other database  like national computer rank test, CET-4, a lot of valuable  information can be discovered. This important information as  reference for the teaching reform is beneficial to improve  quality of teaching.
