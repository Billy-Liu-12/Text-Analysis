Data Mining Application in Designing Popular and Optimal Travel Packages

Abstract  We developed a strategy to design a travel  package with the most popular and appropriate elements for the traveler; at the same time, this strategy minimizes the operation and processing costs of the travel agency. Association rules as a data mining technique is implemented to develop this model.  We rely on the available massive travel agency database to make essential decisions related to the optimality of designing the travel package. A heuristic algorithm is an approach used to solve the final model. An illustrative numerical example based on a made-up data set is also provided.

1. Introduction  Travel agencies in today?s competitive market  are on the spot to deliver the most suitable travel package promotion to customers. The suitable travel package assumes that it has the right, highly demanded elements: flight tickets, hotel reservations, rental cars, and entertainment event tickets. The discounted travel package, the long-established marketing tool to increase the market share, is becoming incapable of contending in the highly competitive travel environment. Hence, new cutting-edge strategies in marketing and operations are coming into sight to accomplish the mission of satisfying customers, while at the same time making a reasonable profit.  In this paper, we present a strategy to design a travel package with the most popular and appropriate elements included in the package, while simultaneously minimizing operating and processing costs. Given that data mining refers to the process of the extraction of hidden predictive information from large databases, we deliver a strategy that implements a common data mining technique, association rules, which will be discussed later in this paper.  We expect essential decisions could be made based on the massive travel agency database.

A standard travel package under investigation includes one or more of the following elements: flight reservations, a hotel reservation, car rental, and tickets to entertainment events.  There are two types of flight reservations: round-trip and one-way trip. There are three levels of hotels in which to make reservations: first-class hotels (4 or 5 star), second-class hotels (less than 4 star), and motels. Moreover, we assume that entertainment events include mainly the following five items: sporting event tickets, performing arts tickets, museum tickets, cruise trips, and dining events.  These elements have the dependency characteristics existing among some or all of them, e.g. customer most likely requests a hotel for every night between arrival and departure of the flight. It is clear that we have too many possible combinations for designing a travel package.

An example of a possible design for a travel is having a travel package that includes a two-way flight ticket, motel reservation, and dining event. This huge number of travel packages is hard to offer and to maintain from a profit point of view and/or administration point of view. Hence, we will develop, according to our knowledge, the first cutting-edge strategy that investigates the optimality of designing travel packages offered by travel agencies.

2. Relevant works   Heung and Chu [1] investigated the most important factors for selecting a travel agency that offers all-inclusive travel packages. Their study results showed that formal communication and pricing factors are significant in the travel agency selection process. In this paper, the pricing factor stimulated our objective function to be focused on operations and processing cost reduction. Consequently, that will increase the likelihood of the travel agency to be selected as a service provider.

Agard and Kusiak [2] introduced a model for  selection of subassemblies based on the analysis of prior    orders received from the customers.  They implemented the data mining approach by using the association rules technique to extract the hidden relationship between the subassembly modules of wire harness automotive parts.

The research in this paper broadens the application from the manufacturing sector to the service sector by generalizing Agard?s and Kusiak?s approach and then applying the same scheme to the designing of the travel package problem.

3. The Model   Our procedure for solving the problem mentioned above in the problem section consists of a two-stage analysis. The first stage is based on taking advantage of data mining teachings ?Association Rules - to eliminate unfavorable travel packages. Finding the hidden relation in the travel agency database is an efficient way to find which travel package elements go together and which do not.  The Association Rules technique will reduce the number of travel package combinations. This is a necessary goal of a travel agency since it will focus the travel agency?s efforts and resources toward promoting fewer but more popular travel packages.  Then, the second stage of the analysis is an optimization model for minimizing operation and processing costs of the remaining travel packages.  The expectations of this analysis are a set of highly- demanded, profitable travel packages.

3.1 Nomenclature:  The following nomenclature will be used in this paper: - Indices: i: travel package index j: element index, the values of j index are presented in Table 1.

It is a data mining technique where rules are extracted out of the database and then ordered based on the percentage of times they are correct and how often they apply.  It captures the relation among events in a database and it takes the form of: if event A (called antecedent event) occurred then event B (called consequent event) will happen with a certain probability. Symbolically, BA ?  and it is read A implies B. The two main concepts that determine the outline of the association rules are: 1) Accuracy - accuracy refers to the probability that if the antecedent is true then the precedent will be true.  High accuracy means that this is a rule that is highly dependable. 2) Coverage - Coverage refers to the number of records in the database that the rule applies to.  High coverage means that the rule can be used very often and also that it is less likely to be a spurious artifact of the sampling technique or idiosyncrasies of the database (internet reference). In some literature, accuracy is called the confidence of the rule and coverage is called the support. A classic example of association rules is the analysis of convenience store data that showed customers often buy diapers and beer together.

Consequently, it is a brilliant idea to consider putting the two together in order to increase cross-selling [3, 4].

In this paper, the best set of travel packages, {TPi}, will be determined -without losing the procedure generality- based on a sample of synthetic data set in Table 2. We have records of 10 transactions from the travel agency database for one destination. In each  R ou  nd -T  rip F  lig ht    O ne  -W ay  F lig  ht   C ru  is e  Tr ip    Fi rs  t-C la  ss H  ot el    Se co  nd - C  la ss  H ot  el   M ot  el   R en  ta l C  ar   Sp or  t E ve  nt   A rt  Sh ow  E ve  nt   M us  eu m  E ve  nt   D in  in g  e ve  nt   J 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11     Table 2: Synthetic data set  record, we use 1 whenever the element was reserved and 0 whenever the customer did not ask for the element.

There is a large number of possible association  rules that could be generated. Examples of some the association rules extracted from the database are: AR1: - If a round-trip flight was booked in one of the customer records, then a first-class hotel reservation was also made.  This happens with an accuracy =71% and a coverage = 50% AR2: - If in one of the customer records a motel room is not reserved, then a museum ticket will not be bought.

This happens with an accuracy =87% and a coverage = 70% AR3: - If a round-trip flight is booked and a first-class hotel reservation is made, then a car will also be rented.

This happens with an accuracy =71% and a coverage = 50% AR4: - If a car is reserved, a dining event booked, and tickets for sporting and museum events bought, then a motel reservation would not be made.  This happens with an accuracy =100% and a coverage = 20%   In order to make the analysis more efficient,  the following guidelines are suggested for selecting the most efficient association rules: 1) a significant association rule should have an accuracy percentage higher than 70% 2) a significant association should have coverage percentage higher than 30% 3) Each association rule should have more than one element in the travel package; as a business rule, we  assume that all single element items are possible travel packages.

When the synthetic data set is used and the above guidelines are applied then the significant association rules obtained.  These rules are (A: Accuracy, C: Coverage):  RA1: Round-Trip Flight and First Class Hotel [with A=71%,C= 50%] RA3: Round-Trip Flight, Rental Car, and First Class Hotel [with A=71%,C= 50%] RA5 one-way Flight and Cruise Trip [with A=75%,C= 30%] RA6 Sport Event and Dining Event [with A=75%,C= 30%] RA7 Round-Trip Flight and Rental Car [with A=71%,C= 50%] RA8 Rental Car and First Class Hotel [with A=100%,C= 50%]  After we determine the significant association rules, we added corresponding to these association rules a travel package that has elements as in the association rules. i.e since AR1 suggests that if a round-trip flight was booked, then a first-class hotel reservation was also made, then we design a travel package that has two elements a: round-trip flight and a first-class hotel reservation. This specific travel package is denoted by P12. In the next section, a refinement for the resulted travel packages that are listed in Table 3 is implemented using the costs minimization model.

An example for these techniques is data clustering where similar elements are grouped in one group. Two recommended data clustering are K- means approach for clustering binary data [5] and large items clustering of transactions [6].

3.3 Stage II analysis   The optimization model is a minimization model of the total costs acquired by offering more than one element for each suggested travel package. There are many types of costs involved in the process of providing a travel package. Commonly, for single- element reservation - perhaps just a flight ticket or just a hotel reservation - there is primarily a set-up cost to process this single reservation. Under the set-up cost category, one or more of the following activities may occur to justify the set-up costs: 1) Web-based reservation requires order fees to maintain the web-site application process for each purchase that is placed. 2) Follow-up process requires human resources to review the application, contact the actual service providers to assure the availability of the service, and to make the final reservation. 3) Finally, there are costs in keeping the travel agency records up-to-date following each transaction or reservation. In contrast, for a travel package that has more than one element, the same set-up cost activities mentioned above are still valid, but we expect that the cost will be lower. This is mainly due to the fact that most of the time it is cheaper to process an application that has reservations for two elements, than  it is to process two separate applications for each type of reservation.

The second type of cost for this model is losses in sale costs, which is analogous to the holding inventory cost in the production system.  Offering a package that sells two reservations together without offering to customers the chance of making a reservation for a single event causes a loss in sale costs. This is due to the fact that some customers are not interested in buying a package as a whole, but rather are only interested in buying a single event. Hence, a loss in sale costs occurs when these types of customers shop among other travel agencies that are willing to offer the single element travel package.  According to the above rationale, it is clear that Li = 0 for the single element travel package.

Finally, there are incremental advertising and  promoting costs. Marketing theories show that it is more likely that advertising for a group of items is more expensive than promoting a single item. A TV commercial and/or a newspaper ad for a group of items is lengthier and more expensive that it would be for a single item?s advertisement. This is due to the fact that the newspaper ad would require more space, thus increasing the fee for placement.  The same goes for a TV commercial which would require a longer block of time to showcase the products. The travel packages costs are summarized in Table 3. Moreover, the total cost is mathematically formulated as follows:   Total cost for travel package i: C(i) = Ai+Li+Ti   The final binary integer constrained  optimization model is symbolized as follows:     Table 3: Travels packages with operating costs  Tr av  el p  ac ka  ge e  le m  en t (  s)   R ou  nd -T  rip F  lig ht    O ne  -W ay  F lig  ht   C ru  is e  Tr ip    Fi rs  t-C la  ss H  ot el    Se co  nd -C  la ss  H ot  el   M ot  el   R en  ta l C  ar   Sp or  t E ve  nt   A rt  Sh ow  E ve  nt   M us  eu m  E ve  nt   D in  in g  Ev en  t  R ou  nd -T  rip F  lig ht  a nd  F irs  t - C  la ss  H ot  el   R ou  nd -T  rip F  lig ht  , R en  ta l C  ar ,  an d  Fi rs  t-C la  ss H  ot el    O ne  -w ay  F lig  ht a  nd C  ru is  e Tr  ip   Sp or  t e ve  nt a  nd D  in in  g Ev  en t  R ou  nd -T  rip F  lig ht  a nd  R en  ta l  C ar    R en  ta l a  r a nd  F irs  t-C la  ss   H ot  el   TPi TP1 TP2 TP3 TP4 TP5 TP6 TP7 TP8 TP9 TP10 TP11 TP12 TP13 TP14 TP15 TP16 TP17 |TPi| 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 3 2 2 2 2 Ai 10 9 12 6 5 5 6 8 3 2 6 15 10 15 9 12 9 Li 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 6 3 2 4 3 Ti 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 3  C(i) 12 11 14 8 7 7 8 10 5 4 8 26 19 21 14 19 15    Minimize  ( )? =  ?++ n  i TPiii i  ITLA    s.t.

If this is not the case, we do not worry by adding this element at the first place. The first constraint is to assure that this assumption is satisfied.

4. The Model Solution   The above optimization problem is called set  covering problem, and the heuristic solution Algorithm is available in [7, 8, 9], also [2] used the same Algorithm to solve there subassembly optimization problem. The algorithm is as follows [7]:  Algorithm Step 1: Set {TPi} = set of all resulted travel packages, Pi, after the implementation of the association rules guidelines.  Also set the solution set = ? .

Step 2: check if {TPi} = ? ?  stop ,the solution set is the optimal solution, if {TPi} ? ? ? find a travel package index i , denoted i*, that maximize  TiLiAi Tpi  ++ where iTP  is the number of elements  in the tPi. Then continue to step 3  Table 5: Heuristic algorithm procedure and output   Step 3: add TPi* to the solution set. Eliminate from {TPi} all the travel packages TPi that have the elements of TPi*. then go to step 2.

End  In this section we will implement the above algorithm on the synthetic data set in table 2. The first step is concerned about initiation of the solution set, it is as follows:   For Step 1 in the Algorithm, set {TPi} = {TP1, TP2, TP3, TP4, TP5, TP6, TP7, TP8,  TP9,  TP10, TP11, TP12, TP13, TP14, TP15, TP16, TP17}, this is since there are 17 remaining travel packages after the implementation the association rules the first stage of the analysis. Then set the Set Solution = ? . The rest of the iterations are summarized in Table 4. It took eight iterations to find the optimal solution. From iteration number 7, the optimal travel packages are: TP10: {Museum Event}, TP9: {Art Show Event}, TP13: {Round-Trip Flight, rental car, First-Class Hotel}, TP15: {Sport event, dining event}, TP6: {Motel}, TP5: {Second-Class Hotel} and TP14: {One-way Flight, Cruise Trip}  The heuristic algorithm approach could be tested for robustness by comparing the solution with other optimal or near optimal approaches. One possible approach is mathematical modeling programming language to construct a model solution. The complete version of this paper used Mathematical Programming Language to solve for the optimal solution besides the heuristic approach [10]. This alternative approach became essential in the case where the size of problem became larger.

Conclusion   A two-stage analysis has been used to develop an efficient procedure to optimize the process of designing a travel package.  The first stage consisted of the extraction of the association rules from among the travel package elements in the database. This action would help to eliminate the inappropriate travel packages. Then, the second stage consisted of a binary, cost minimization, optimization problem to improve the design.

The result of this model, although it is a cost  based model, is the outline of a solid frame for pricing the services provided by travel agencies. The outputs anticipated from these outlines are: low cost operations, popular travel packages, and state of the art techniques to contend in the competitive market .The same analysis scheme could be broadened to reflect other real-life cases. In conclusion, this investigation showed that data mining is a powerful tool to make a better marketing and operating decision.
