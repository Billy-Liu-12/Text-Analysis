Research of Mining the Meta-association Rules Based  on the Model of GM (1.1)

Abstract?The association rule mining aims at the relationships between the items of the transaction data.

Because the transaction data often has characteristics of time stamps, the support value and the confidence value of a certain rule are not quite the same in different periods of time. It is of great help to do further study and make a strategic decision to set up a Meta-association rule for the association rule, analyze and predict the change tendency of its support value and confidence value. By means of an example, this paper analyzes the usual mining process of the Meta-association Rules by the model of GM(1,1). It also evaluates the advantages and disadvantages of the model of GM(1.1) during the mining process.

I. INTRODUCTION Association rule mining is used to discover the  relationships between the items in the transaction data. The results of the mining may provide useful information and then guide the decisions. In the process of mining, support and confidence are the two important factors of the rule?s evaluation. Commonly, if the support and the confidence of a certain rule are greater than their predicted ones, called minimum support and minimum confidence, the rule is considered to be useful and called strong association rule [1]. However, as the transaction data often has characteristics of time, the data sets will get larger over time. The support value and the confidence value of a rule will change accordingly and form a support series and a confidence series. By means of the incremental association rule mining technology [2,3], the two series will be found; by setting up ?rule?s rule?, that is meta-association rules [4,5], the change tendency of a rule can be represented more clearly. As to the association rule itself, this tendency will be more useful to the decision maker. The rule series are uncertain and usually have only several numbers; the deficient information of rule series characteristics makes the meta-association rule mining hardly get a reasonable result. By the model of GM(1,1)[6], the meta-association rule mining may be easier and the result may be more helpful to the decision maker.



II.  THEORY BASIS The following definitions and theorems are needed in  order to set up the meta-association rules? model of GM(1,1) and then predict the next value of rule series.

Definition 1:Supposing ))(,),2(),1(( )0()0()0()0( nxxxX = ,  ))(,),2(),1(( )1()1()1()1( nxxxX = , and x(1)(k)= (0)  ( )  k  i x i  =? , then: bkaXkX =+ )()( )1()0(                                         (1)  is the original format of the model of GM(1,1).

Definition 2: Supposing )0(X  and )1(X  are defined as  definition 1? ))(,),3(),2(( )1()1()1()1( nzzzZ = , and  (1) (1) (1)( ) 0.5( ( ) ( 1))z k x k x k= + ? ,k=2,3,?,n?  bkazkx =+ )()( )1()0(                                           (2) is the basic format of the model of GM(1,1).

Definition 3: Supposing X is the original data series, D is the cushioning arithmetic operator. Whether X is increase series, decrease series or change series. If the cushioning series XD increases (or decreases) slower than the original series X, or the change swing is weaker than the original series X, the cushioning arithmetic operator D is called smooth cushioning arithmetic operator; If the cushioning series XD increases (or decreases) faster than the original series X, or the change swing is stronger than the original series X, the cushioning arithmetic operator D is called sharp cushioning arithmetic operator.

Theorem 1: Supposing the original data series X=(x(1), x(2),?, x(n))?the cushioning series XD=(x(1)d, x(2)d,?, x(n)d)?and  kx(k)+(k+1)x(k+1)+...+nx(n) x(k)d  (n+k)(n-k+1)/2 = , k=1,2,?,n                 (3)     The cushioning arithmetic operator D is called smooth cushioning arithmetic operator whether X is increase series, decrease series or change series.

Theorem 2: Supposing X(0) is not negative numbers, X(0)=(x(0)(1),x(0)(2),?,x(0)(n))?and x(0)(k)? 0, k=1,2,?,n; X(1) is the 1-AGO series of X(0), X(1)=(x(1)(1),x(1)(2),?,x(1)(n)), and x(1)(k)=x(0)(1)+?+ x(0)(k), k=1,2,?,n; Z(1) is the neighbor-average series of X(1),Z(1)=(z(1)(2),z(1)(3),?,z(1)(n)),and z(1)(k)=0.5x(1)(k)+x(1)(k-1)), k=2,3,?,n. If [a,b]T is the parameter column, and  ( 0 )  ( 0 )  ( 0 )  x (2)  x (3) Y  x (n)  ...

=  ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?  ,  (1)  (1)  (1)  z (2) 1  z (3) 1 B  ... ...

z (n) 1  ?  ? =  ?  ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?  (4)  The least-squares estimation column of the GM(1,1) model: x(0)(k)+az(1)(k)=b fit the following expression:  [ ] ( )-1T T T? a, b B B B Y? = =  (5) Theorem 3: Supposing X(0) is not negative numbers, X(1)  is the 1-AGO series of X(0), and Z(1) is the neighbor-average series of X(1), [a,b]T=(BTB)-1BTY, so  (1)  (1)dx ax b  dt + =  (6)  is the whiten equation of the GM(1,1) model x(0)(k)+az(1)(k)=b. The equation is called shadow equation, too.And  ( )(1) ( 0 ) -akb bx (k+1) x (1) e + a a  = ? ; k=1,2,? (7)  is the solution of the whiten equation of the GM(1,1) model x(0)(k)+az(1)(k)=b. The solution is called time response function, too.



III. DESCRIPTIONS OF THE ALGORITHM One of the main purposes of meta-association rule mining is to discover the change tendency of the association rule series over time periods. By setting up the model of this tendency, the meta-association rule mining can predict the next possible value of support and confidence of a rule.

There are two main methods in the meta-association rule mining: one is the method based on statistics [4], the other is the method based on fuzzy decision trees [5]. As far as mass data processing is concerned, the method based on fuzzy decision trees is obviously unsuitable. The method based on statistics lacks efficient solutions to the uncertain data series and the result of meta-association rule mining sometimes may be incorrect.

The reasonable result in meta-association rule mining of  r  based on the model of GM(1,1) is the introduction of the smooth cushioning (or the sharp cushioning) arithmetic operator. By slowing down the speed of support series about r, the smooth cushioning series get rid of some disturbing information in the original series. In addition, it is needed to generate not only the smooth cushioning series but also the sharp cushioning series of the original series before doing the analysis. Set up GM(1,1) models of the smooth cushioning series, the sharp cushioning series and the original series, the predicted result getting from meta-association rule mining is not a determinate single value of the original series but many different possible values that the truth would be in the future. Hence, it is more reasonable for us to master the change tendency of the rules.

The following shows the specific steps of the meta- association rule mining based on the model of GM(1,1):  1) Calculate the smooth cushioning series (the sharp cushioning series) of the rule series, and series X(0) is obtained;  2)  Calculate the 1-AGO series of  X (0) and series X(1) is obtained;  3) Check the smooth characteristics of X(0) and the change pattern of series X(1) so as to determine whether or not the GM(1,1) model can be set;  4) Calculate the neighbor-average series of  X(1) and the least-squares estimation of the parameter column;  5) Set up the whiten equation of the GM (1,1) model and the time response function of it;  6) The time response function may be regarded as the model of meta-association rules. By using GM (1,1),the association rule?s change tendency is obvious.



IV. AN EXAMPLE OF THIS ALGORITHM For example, suppose rule r has support series (0.90, 0.92, 0.94, 0.96, 0.98), what would be the next support value?

This example shows a typical increase case of support series. In applications, the reason that causes the increase trend of support series is complicated. Such as in shopping basket analysis, the change of the customers? consume habit, the alternatives of the seasons, the trends of the fashions, the advertisement effects as well as discount activities of the sellers, etc, are all the factors of the reason.

Actually, the effect of the change of the customers? consumption habit is permanent and is mostly concerned by the decision makers. Other factors, which occur at a short period of time, should be treated as disturbing data.

The following is the dealing process of the example, by which the differences of the method based on statistics and the method based on the model of GM(1,1) are explored clearly.

A. Method based on Statistics The method based on statistics uses linear regression     techniques to get the fitted regression line of support series about r. The solution equation of linear regression, and the next possible support value will be got. Suppose, R={r(1),r(2),r(3),r(4),r(5)}={0.90,0.92,0.94,0.96,0.98}, the equation of liner regression is r(k)=0.02k+0.88; the result is r(6)=1.00. That means in the next time period, the support of r should be 100%.

B. 4.2. Method based on the Model of GM(1,1) Using the method based on the model of GM(1,1), the process is of following steps.

1) Introduce the smooth cushioning arithmetic operator D, set X(0)=r(x)D, the smooth cushioning series is X(0) = (0.9533,0.9571,0.9633,0.9711,0.9800). Calculate the 1- AGO series of X(0), and the result is X(1) =(0.9533, 1.9105, 2.8738, 3.8449, 4.8249).

2) Check the smooth restriction of X(0). According to the formula:  ( 0 )  (1)  x (k) (k)  x (k-1) ? =  (8)  (3)? ?0.5042, (4)? ?0.3379<0.5 and (5)? ?0.2549<0.5. If k>3, the smooth restriction of X(0) is  satisfying.

3) Check the X(1) series to make sure whether it fits the  exponential relationship. According to the formula: (1)  (1)  x (k) (k)  x (k-1) ? =  (9)  (3)? ?1.5042, (4)? ?1.3379 and (5)? ?1.2549. If k>3, (k)? ? [1,1.5], ? =0.5, the exponential relationship of  X (1) series is proved, and the series are  satisfying, the model of GM(1,1) can be required.

4) Calculate the neighbor-average series of X(1), and the result is Z(1) = (z(1)(2), z(1)(3), z(1)(4), z(1)(5))=(1.4319, 2.3921, 3.3594, 4.3349), and  0.9571  0.9633 Y  0.9711  0.9800  =  ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?? ?  ?  1.4319 1  2.3921 1 B  3.3594 1  4.3349 1  ?  ? =  ?  ?  ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?? ?    5) Calculate the least-squares estimation of the parameter column, the result is:  ? ?  ? ? ?  ?? =  9452.0 0079.0  a?  6) Set up the whiten equation of the GM(1,1) model:  (1)  (1)dx 0.0079x 0.9452 dt  ? =  And the time response function of it is: (1)  x (k+1)? 0.0079k120.5989e 119.6456? ; k=1,2,?  7) Predict next support value of r by using GM(1,1), the result is r(6)=0.9871. That means in the next time period, the support of r should be 98.71%.

C. 4.3. Comparison of the two methods Figure.1 shows the differences between the two methods in support series of r analysis.

1 2 3 4 5 6  0.9  0.95  1.0000 0.9871  r  GM(1,1)    Figure 1.  Compare of the two methods    With Figure.1 and the discussions before, it is clear that if the method of statistics is used, the line is quite steady and the next support of r is r(6)=1.0000. In common sense, the result is obviously wrong. In contrast, the method based on the model of GM(1,1) provides a more reasonable result and that predicts the next support of r is r(6)=0.9871.

Further, it can provide the decision maker with the additional information that the truth shows by the example association rule r, which is getting popular, will slow down its steps in the future.

The key reason of the reasonable result in meta-association rule mining of r based on the model of GM(1,1) is the introduction of the smooth cushioning arithmetic operator.

By slowing down the speed of support series of r, the smooth cushioning series get rid of some disturbing information in the original series.

In normal cases, it is needed to generate not only the smooth cushioning series but also the sharp cushioning series of the original series. Set up GM(1,1) models of the smooth cushioning series, the sharp cushioning series and the original series, the predicted result getting from meta- association rule mining is not a determinate single value of the original series but three different possible values that the truth would be in the future.



V. CONCLUSION The analysis above shows that the meta-association rule mining based on the model of GM(1,1) has the following     advantages: (1) The GM(1,1) model of meta-association rule get rid of some disturbing information, so that the result of the  meta-association rule mining is more reasonable; (2) By using the smooth cushioning series, the sharp cushioning series and the original series of a rule, the meta-association rule gets several possible values of a rule as time goes by. (3) Contrast the real value and the predicted values of a rule, the reason why the series change steadily or change slowly will be discovered; further, the decision maker can find out the key of this phenomenon and make more accurate decisions. On the contrary, the disadvantage of the method is obvious: such as the GM(1,1) model can not be used to analyze the curves; the association rule series must fit the smooth and the pattern restriction, etc. All these affect the usage of the method.
