Genetic Algorithm-Based Rules Discovery for

Abstract - To choose and manage networked manufacturing  resources efficiently, a fuzzy association rules mining technique  was proposed. According to the analysis of all data types, a  specialized data preprocessing method was applied to extract,  wash and transform networked manufacturing resources data,  and a self-contained data warehouse on networked  manufacturing resources was established for data preprocessing.

To deal with the fuzzy association rules mining on manufacturing  resources platform, a novel genetic algorithm (GA) based mining  method was introduced. Considering the characteristics of  networked manufacturing resources, double-level encoding and  label-bit switching operator were designed to make the improved  GA available to networked manufacturing resources. Finally, a  case was employed to demonstrate the practicality of applying  fuzzy association rules mining based on GA in networked  manufacturing resources management.

I. INTRODUCTION  Nowadays information technology is widely applied and network economy is developing fast. More and more  manufacturing enterprises rely on network to search and  organize manufacturing resources. Under this situation,  manufacturing resources management platform has been an  efficient managing tool that offers uniform and normative  management for manufacturing enterprises, and this strategy  enables enterprises to focus their efforts and resources on  developing core business and has been a trend [1][2]. With the growing improvement of service qualities offered by the  manufacturing resources management platform and the  increasing number of the manufacturing enterprises which are  applying the management platform, the data of all kinds in the  management platform database have become larger and larger,  and this trend makes the networked manufacturing resources  more difficult to manage than ever [3][4]. Finding an efficient  networked manufacturing resources management approach has been an important research subject. Optimizing configuration  of networked manufacturing resources puts a significant  influence on the success of web-based dynamic manufacturing  league [5][6]. Working as models that identify specific types  of data, association rules have been used as an efficient  decision-making strategy in many fields [7][8]. Also  association rules discovery is obviously a helpful tool to  choose, organize and manage mass data from manufacturing  resources field. Different association rules denote different  underlying regularities in the database. Data mining is a  powerful artificial intelligence technology of extracting hidden  predictive information from large databases and is used to  discover patterns and relationships in the data in order to help  make better business decisions [9]. Association rules mining is a very important data mining method that extracts valuable  relationship among data sets by special search algorithms and  expresses characteristics of the relationship [10].

At present some association rules mining approaches  have been studied such as Aprior method [11], rough set [12],  decision tree [13] and artificial neural network [14], however  there is no relative researches of applying association rules on  manufacturing resources management field. Considering the peculiarity and complication of the manufacturing resources  management [15], we bring association rules into the decision  analysis for networked manufacturing resources and  implement association rules analysis on the attribute values of  manufacturing resources by an improved genetic algorithm  after the fuzzyfication. Thus association characteristics  between outer factors that influence the values of  manufacturing resources attributes and inner factors (such as services provided by networked manufacturing resources  management platform) are mined and provide helpful decision  information for manufacturing resources management.



II. MANUFACTURING RESOURCES RULES MINING PROCESS  A virtual data warehouse (see Fig. 1) is built to temporarily store manufacturing resources data which includes analyzing data, description data and detailed data. A virtual data warehousing strategy provides the ultimate in flexibility as well as the minimum amount of redundant data that must be loaded and maintained. This approach can also put the largest unplanned query load on operational systems [16][17]. Data in data house mainly including enterprise?s general information, product information, human resources, technological resources, equipment resources, software and hardware resources of enterprises and auxiliary information. And the data preprocessing is mainly composed by following three  parts.

Fig. 1 Association rules mining model  A. Data Preprocessing  1) Data Extraction: Data need to be extracted from the data warehouse according to the demands of the rules mining.

2) Dimension-Eliminating Treatment: All attribute values of the manufacturing resources used for the data mining can be  divided into two groups- quantitative attribute data and  qualitative attribute data. Quantitative attributes also can be  divided into two subclasses ? positive quantitative attributes  and negative quantitative ones. So their corresponding values  can be divided in the same way. Taking quantitative attributes  into account, we assume gene 2G , 5G ,  ,6G , ,Gi , Gm  is a attributes team of continual real  number values, where i means the i th gene of a chromosome.

And V3,V2,,V1 Vn,,Vj  are the values of the  corresponding attributes, which have been preprocessed  already. Next we have to treat positive quantitative attributes  (such as contract-performing ratio G5 , enterprise  capital G6 and etc.) and negative quantitative ones (such as  reject ratio G2 , product price G11, and etc.) respectively. In order to achieve the automation of the appraising system, most  steps of assessment of two different kind quantitative  attributes are the same. For example, we want to give an  enterprise with low reject ratio a high score automatically. All  quantitative attribute values are dimension-eliminating  processed in following matrix, as in (1).

=F  UmnUinnUnUnUnUChromn  UmjUijjUiUjUiUChromj  UmUiUUUUChrom  UmUiUUUUChrom  UmUiUUUUChrom  GmGiGGGG        3) Fuzzyfication processing: All quantitative attributes are classified into several groups according to their fuzzy  subjection degree. (See Table 1).

TABLE I  5 GRADES OF ATTRIBUTES VALUES  Mark Grade Positive quantitative  attribute values  Negative quantitative  attribute values  1 Lowest [0, 0.2) [0.8, 1.0]  2 Lower [0.2, 0.4) [0.6, 0.8) 3 Normal [0.4, 0.6) [0.4, 0.6)  4 Higher [0.6, 0.8) [0.2, 0.4) 5 Highest [0.8, 1.0] [0, 0.2)  After fuzzyfication and dimension-eliminating  processing, matrix 'F  is transformed into a multi-dimension loosen matrix ''F  (where number 0 denotes the value is null), as in (2).

III. GA BASED ASSOCIATION RULES MINING ALGORITHM  Encoding, genetic operators and fitness function of the  GA are redesigned according to the specific demands of the  manufacturing resources.

A. Encoding An association rule includes two parts: condition part (IF  part) and consequence part (THEN part), and every condition  attribute in IF part has its own corresponding gene. Genes of  chromosomes are represented as iji VG = , where iG  is the i th condition attribute, ijV  is its corresponding value. In  order to simplify condition encoding of chromosomes, a  position-encoding way is adopted. In this way, each  chromosome is in same length and every gene?s position is  pre-designed. For instance, in an experiment there are n condition attributes, and each chromosome is made up of n gene seats. Each attribute occupies a fixed gene seat in the  chromosome, and only attribute values are encoded. If a  condition attribute j is not a necessary component of an  association rule, it doesn?t need to be cut down from the  corresponding chromosome. What we only to do is to change the Boolean flag?s value. Fig. 2 is the representation model of  a chromosome, where m is the total number of attributes is whose values compose a chromosome. Each gene contains a  label iB (Boolean flag [8][18]), which shows if the  corresponding gene of a condition works or not. Though in an experiment all chromosome individuals have same length, in  fact some genes are phenotype (where iB =1) and some genes  are recessive (where iB =0), thus we can use chromosome  individuals of same length to represent all kinds of fuzzy  association rules that are even of different length.

How many conditions are necessary to produce an  integral association rule is uncertain in advance, but mining  method based on GA can ascertain the number of the  conditions automatically.

Each individual gains its fitness from the compare with others,  and the individuals with excellent comprehensive performance  gains lager fitness easier. The task of mining association rules  is to discover the helpful association among different data. In  order to procure association rules from attribute sets, firstly we choose relative attributes according to restriction conditions,  then calculate and compare the fitness, finally output the best  resolution.

1) Goal Functions: In order to keep the efficiency of association attributes, each association rule combination must  be appraised according to the relative restrictions, which  means all condition attribute combinations must meet  following goal functions.

a) Average emergence (AE)  AE =  =  = ?=  n  i  j  i  j  i  n  i  j  i  B  BXVP    )(  AEmin?                         (4)  Where )( jiVP  is the average probability of condition  attribute j  iG whose value is X  in data warehouse.

=  j  iB  AEmin  is the preset threshold.

b) Support (S)  S=P( GoalAttr?CondAttr ) ? minS                              (5) Where CondAttr  is the condition set; GoalAttr  is consequence set.

minS is predestined minimum support threshold.

c) Confidence (C)  C=P( CondlAttrGoalAttr ) ? minC                                (6)  Where C is the probability of consequence set GoalAttr when condition set CondlAttr  emerges.

minC is predestined minimum confidence threshold.

2) Function Design: Association rules  appraisement is a multi-goals decision problem; it is usually  difficult for decision-makers to gain accurate value of each  goal attribute. But decision makers could definitely give out ideal and minimum bearable values. So a positive ideal point  AE+ S+ C+  and a negative ideal point AE- S-  C- is given by the decision makers.

)(kf = )()(  )(  kdkd  kd +?  ?  + (7)  where  +  ?  +  ?  +  ? ? ???=  C  WCkC  S  WSkS  AE  WkAE kd CSAE  ))(( ,  ))(( ,  )AE)(( )(  (8)  +  +  +  +  +  + + ???=  C  WCkC  S  WSkS  AE  WkAE kd CSAE  ))(( ,  ))(( ,  )AE)(( )(  (9)  Let ?  be the norm, k  be the number of chromosome  generations, ?d be distance between the function and  negative ideal point, +d be the distance between the function  and positive ideal point.

?? AE)(kAE , ?? SkS )( ,  ?? CkC )( , +? AE)(kAE , +? SkS )(  and +? CkC )( are divided by AE+, S+, C+ respectively to eliminate  dimensions. Considering the difference of the influence of  AE, S and C on rules mining, they are processed with weight  WAE, WS and WC respectively.



IV. RULES MATCH  After rules mining, a rules set with many redundant rules  is gained. Romao [19][20] adopts a general impressions to resolve this problem. In this paper we design a special  knowledge library to store knowledge, common sense and  previous association rules in manufacturing resources field.

Each newly mined rule is compared with knowledge or rules  in knowledge library, and redundant or meaningless rules will  be deleted. As Fig. 3 shows, {Rule1, ,Rule i , ,Rule m } represents a newly mined rules set, {GK1 ,GK j ,  GK n } represents the knowledge set in knowledge library.

Each Rule i is compared with knowledge in knowledge library, then some useful rules are stored in the knowledge library and  transformed into knowledge. If Rule i  and GK j  are in same  form, then other additional attributes (such as mining  conditions, property, population scale) are compared.

In order to meet the demands of the  The attribute takes part in data mining work Else     market, platform managers plan to adjust some manufacturing  resources management projects. Data of passed 8 months are  prepared for data mining. 48 attributes including 36 outer  attributes (time, quality, cost, service and environment, from  A to AJ) and 12 inner attributes (from BA to BL) together  with following 6 goal attributes (see Table 2) are chosen to  carry out GA based data mining.

Considering all  kinds of objective factors, decision makers could retouch the results with weights and adjust the projects according to  previous experience.
