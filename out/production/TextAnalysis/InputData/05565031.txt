I. INTRODUCTION  Information technology brings a great convenience to  people's lives and work, but with its deeper and extensive  application in the social life, it also brings many new  problems, in which the data security is one of the most  prominent problems.

Network systems, operating systems and database  management systems are three supporting platforms of the  information system, which is an inseparable whole, any of  them having a security risk will directly affect the entire  information system security. In particular, the security of the  database plays a vital role in the information system,  because in the overall security of information systems,  database is often the ultimate goal, is the core and  foundation of information systems, most likely to attract  attackers [I] . Therefore, intrusion detection has become a  very important security measure, also an essential last line of  defense in any security system.



II. DATABASE INTRUSION DETECTION AND DATA  MINING OVERVIEW  A. Database intrusion detection  The security framework of the database system can be  divided into three levels: network system level, host  operating system level, and database management system  level. These three levels form the security system of the  database system, which is gradually close to the data    security, the importance of preventing is also strengthened  layer by layer, to ensure the security of data from outside to  inside.

1) Network system level security technology  Broadly speaking, the security of the database firstly  depends on the network system. Network system is the  external environment and the basis of the database  application, so to play a strong role of the database system  can not part from the support of the network system, and the  978-1-4244-5540-9/10/$26.00 2010 IEEE   database system users (such as remote users, distributed  [2] users) should be able to access the database through the  network. So the security of the network system is the first  database security barrier, and the external intrusion is begun  from the network system.

2) Host operating system level security technology  The operating system is the running platform of large  database system, which is to provide a certain degree of  security for the database system. At present, most of the  operating system platforms are focused on Windows NT and  UNIX, security level is usually Cl and C2level [3] . The main  security technologies are operating system security policy,  security management strategy, data security, and so on.

3) Database management system level security  technology  Database system security relies on the database  management system in high degree, if the database  management system has a very powerful security mechanism,  then the database system will has better security  performance.

The three levels of the database system security  framework are complementary with each other, and the  prevention focus and the technical means adopted of them  are not the same, so a good security system must take into  account and apply these technologies to ensure data security.

B. Data mining main algorithms  Data mining is an interdisciplinary field, affected by a  number of disciplines, including database systems, statistics,  machine learning, visualization and information science.

There are many data mining methods commonly used in  database intrusion detection, in which the association rule    mining algorithm and sequential pattern mining algorithm  are widely applied in particular. Association rule is to find  the correlation of different items appeared in the same event.

Association rule mining is to derive the implication  relationships between data items under the conditions of a set  of given project types and a number of records and through  analyzing the records, the commonly used algorithm is  Apriori algorithm.



III. ASSOCIATION RULE ALGORITHM IMPROVEMENT  There are many association rule algorithms, and this  paper focuses on analysis and research of Apriori algorithm.

A. Apriori algorithm flow  Apriori algorithm is the basic algorithm to mine and  generate the frequent item sets Boolean association rules  needed, is also a very effective association rule mining [4] . .  . fl h  .

Fig.1 Apriori algorithm flow chart  .8. Apriori algorithm improvement  Apriori algorithm has the following two defects:  i) Algorithm must spend a lot of time to deal with huge  candidate item sets.

2) it must repeatedly scan the transaction database to  carry out pattern matchingfor the candidate item sets.

Just because the above two flaws, this paper presents the  technology based on the data partition to improve the  adaptability and efficiency of the Apriori algorithm. It can  use data partition technique for mining frequent item sets  with only two times of the whole database scan. As shown in    figure 2, it contains two main processing stages. The first  phase, the algorithm will divide the transactional database D  into n independent parts; if the minimum support threshold  in the database D is min_sup, then the minimum support  frequency threshold corresponding to each part IS  .

Transaction data 0  o is divided into n blocks; i ; I  N  Min c block i local frequent itemsets  i=i+1  Construct candidate itemsets  Find all frequent itemsets in the  candidate itemsets  END  Figure 2. Partition mining frequent item sets by using data  In terms of the whole database D, a local frequent item  set is not necessarily the global frequent item set, but any  global frequent item set will certainly occur in the local  frequent item sets obtained by the partition. This is very easy  to get evidence to the contrary. Therefore, the local frequent   item sets mined from n partitions can be as the candidate  item set of the frequent item sets in the whole database D;  and in the second stage again scanning the entire database for  the support frequency of all candidate item sets, to finally  confirm the global frequent item set. The partition size and  number has the standard that each partition can be entirely  placed into memory, so each stage only needs to read the  database content once, and the entire mining needs to scan  the entire database twice.



IV. DATABASE INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM BASED  ON IMPROVED ASSOCIA nON RULE ALGORITHM  A. System structure  The main components of the system as shown in figure 3.

/ Data 7  Historical log  data  Data mining  Determine the  rule base  Rule base update  Figure 3. intrusion detection system flow chart  It works as follows:  i) Normal data .from two parts: one is obtainedfrom the  history log records qfier auditing, and the other is increased  by the network new data after judgment. TherifOre, the  obtained normal data is updated dynamically, can timely  ntlect the latest circs rather than limited to historical data.

2) Carry out collection processing .for normal data to  generate data records with a specific format.

3) According to the data project obtained in the last step,  using an improved association rules algorithm in this paper,  to mine the normal or abnormal rules existed between  d!lforent projects to generate decision rules and send to the  rule base for storage.

4) intrusion detection module will compare the new  rules generatedfrom the current network data stream with  the judgment rules in the rule base, calculate with the  similarity, and then judge the results.

This system is a circularly and dynamically updated  system, but it must first create a set of legitimate access rules  from a static database as the basis for the system's judgment.

After entering the dynamic intrusion detection management  process, the normal data may be extracted from the historical  network data stream through the intrusion detection, or the  additional data judged to be legitimate, which strictly  removes all the possible invasion data, so the rules extracted  from the normal data are normal rules, of course, the better  the more training data, thus the extracted rules are more  complete [6] . When the historical records have not a major  change, the auditing of them can be suspended, but only the  additional data should be processed, which is also an another  improvement of this system to save system resources.

B. Intrusion detection experimental results and analysis  This experiment is mainly to detect three types of  intrusion, separately is legitimate user intrusion, disguised    intrusion, and intrusion attempt.

The test results as shown in table 1:  TABLE!. INTRUSION DETECTION RESULTS  No. Normal Abnormal Detected False  event event anomalies negatives  I 50 50 46 6  2 70 70 64 7  3 100 100 93 8  4 150 150 142 8  5 200 200 197 9  From the table It can be seen that the database mtruslOn  detection system can well complete the dynamic security  management of the database system log, the mined rule base  can timely and effectively reflect the latest situation, better  complete the intrusion judgment, and the test accuracy can  meet the basic requirements.



V. CONCLUSION  Combining with the data mining application in database  intrusion detection, for the most representative association  rule Apriori algorithm in the data mining technology, this  paper presents an improved association rule algorithm, based  on which constructs a database intrusion detection system on  the basis of association rules, and carries out a small range  test. Experimental results show that the rule base of this  system can timely and effectively reflect the latest situation,  better complete the intrusion judgment, and the test accuracy  can meet the basic requirements, well improve the efficiency  of the whole intrusion detection flow.
