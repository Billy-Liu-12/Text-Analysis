Emergency resource planning by using spatial data association rule mining and

Abstract--Spatial attributes are important factors that affect the whole process of emergency events. However, studies on this subject have not sufficiently been carried out. This paper presents a new idea that incorporates spatial predicates describing the spatial relationships between emergency locations and surrounding objects into emergency event analysis. Furthemore, a multi-level spatial data association algorithm is developed to realize knowledge discovery for emergency event analysis.

Traditional linear programming model failed to give reasonable weight for different emergency events ocured in different locations. While this paper uses spatial data assocation rules which detect how spatial attributes affect emergency events as the weighting mechanism for different spots, Based on such method, we finally propose a linear programming method that realize emergency resource planning in a new perspective.

Key words: Spatial data association rule; emergency resource planning; weighting mechanism  INTRODUCTION  With the accelerating rate of urban development, more and more public emergency of natural disasters, accident disaster appear. The rapid growth of municipal economy not only brings about the accumulation of wealth, but also gathers all kinds of potential risks of emergency.

Emergency events result in huge damage and disaster, but at same time, they left important data for emergency management in the next round. There are many patterns hidden in those data, which could guide the further  emergency preparedness[16]. According to some recent emergency management research, emergency rescue efficiency is determined not only by the type of emergency affairs and the time of rescue response, but also by the surrounding objects and demographic information of the related address[1][2].

In this article, we put emergency event data into the perspective of urban geographical information systems, and first propose a spatial data association rule mining method to discover how spatial attributes affect emergency events.

Applying the result as a the weighting method for different spatial location, a logistial equation model is designed for emergency resource distribution.

A spatial association rule is a rule in the form  of %)%,.(...... 2121 scQQQPPP nm ?????   (1)  where at least one of the predicates mPP ......1  nQQ ......1  is a spatial predicate. There are various kinds of  spatial predicates that could constitute a spatial association rule. Some examples are: topological relations like intersects, overlap, disjoint, etc. distance in formation, such as close_to, far_away, etc[3]. The support of a conjunction  of predicates, kPPP ??? ...1 , in a set S, denoted as s%  or )/( SP? , is the number of objects in S which satisfy P  versus the cardinality (i.e., the total number of objects) of S.

The confidence of a rule QP?  in S, denoted as c% , is  2011 Fourth International Joint Conference on Computational Sciences and Optimization  DOI 10.1109/CSO.2011.125     the ratio of )/( SQP ??  versus )/( SP? , i.e., the  possibility that Q is satisfied by a member of S when P is satisfied by the same member of S[4].

In this paper, we first summarize related research spatial data association rule mining methods and geographcial information systems that concerning emergency events (see section 2). After that, spatial predicates are incorporated into the emergency events analysis, and a spatially enabled data association mining method is developed for such analysis(see section 3). Afterward, a linear programming method which incorporates spatial data assocation rule as weigthting method is proposed for emergency event analysis based on Apriori algorithm(see section 4). Section 5 summarizes this study finally.

A.  GIS research for emergency resource planning  It is generally agreed that about 80% of currently used data contains some spatial elements or dimensions[6]. This is typically true in all fields of human endeavor. Traditional information systems for decision support, commonly referred to as management information systems (MIS), were exclusively designed to handle non-spatial data[7]. A GIS is a system which offers the functionality and tools to collect, store, retrieve, analyze, and display geographical-related information[8]. Because of the especial importance of spatiail factors in emergency analysis, a lot of GIS based emergency researches have come out, including the emergency response of earthquakes, fire casualties[1][15], flood treatments[12], traffic accidents[2], chemical disasters etc[10]. But all of the current emergency studies on GIS applications focus on the utilization of its original functions, which include querying, buffering, overlapping, building suitable models in the model-base of GIS[11][13], and establishing logistical networks for improving emergency response [2][10].

Current technologies did not pay enough attention to how emergency events are affected by sorrounding environment and how emergency resoure are distributed in different emergency spots.

B.  Current spatial data association rule mining methods  Spatial data association mining is an area that has not attracted much attention, having only been applied to a few special fields, such as image co-location for discovering mineral resources[3] [8], the association among public facilities in travel industry[14], or correlation between images[9] among others. In general, current studies are incapable of sufficiently analyzing the association between emergency events and their surrounding spatial factors.

Moreover, the suitable analytical function beyond GIS, i.e spatial association rule mining, has not yet been actively developed.

A.  Spatial data association mining  Definition 1:  Spatial predicates. A spatial predicate refers to a description of a spatial relationship between two geographical objects. The general expression of spatial relations can be transformed into facts classified as <Spatialrelation>(Refobj, Taskrelevantobj) [14]. For example, the g-close-to() predicate is used to describe coarsely topological relationships between spatial objects (e.g., close-to(x,park) means that spatial object ?x? lies close to spatial object ?park?).

Definition 2 Association rule with spatial predicates &non-spatial information.  Given A and B as spatial predicates and non-spatial attributes dataset respectively. If  a spatial association rule is in the form of QP?  ( nm QQQPPP ...... 2121 ????? ), then there at least  has PPi ?? , ?iP B ,i.e iP  is a spatial predicate, and  QQi ?? , ?iQ A is an element of non-spatial attribute.

B. Spatially enabled data association rule mining method  Based on the above definitions, a spatial data association mining method based on the Apriori algorithm[4] is designed. The basic algorithm is shown as follows.

Generating spatial association rules Input: 1. The data set C=A B 2.Minimum support threshold: min-sup 3. Minimum confidence threshold: min-conf Output: L {Spatial association Rules}; Method:  1. Begin  2. L=? ;  3. CC ?1  4. Generate frequent 1-itemset  ),1(_ 11 CfrequentgenL ?  5. k=1; 6. Repeat 7.      k=k+1; 8.      Generate candidate k-itemsets  ),(_ 1	? kk LkcandicategenC ;  9.      Generate frequent k-itemsets  ),(_ kk CkfrequentgenL ? ;  10.      kLLL ?  11.  Until  ??kL  12. Generate spatial association rules(L) 13.End;  A. Weighting method  Using the concept of spatial data association mining, we propose methods that find interesting patterns by incorporating spatially related attributes into emergency event information. For example, it uses spatial data association rule similar to the following:  Is(x,fire-emergency) ? Inside(x,school) ?  Emergency-response(x, 1g =slow) 25% 72 % (2)  Rule (2): if fire emergency events occur in school campuses, then the response time of fire emergency is always ?slow?. 72%(c%) means that 72% of those emergency events happened in school campuses, result in  slow emergency response. Where ig  represents the value  set of ?response speed?, such {slow, medium, fast, very fast }. There are altogether 25% (s%) of fire events, happened in a school with low emergency response. There is an Inside(x, school) function that describes the spatial relationship between the emergency event?s location and a surrounding object. This function provides a significant spatial clue for emergency management, through which the government could determine its emergency preparedness based on the geographical characteristics mentioned in the rule.

B Multi-objective linear programming  Other than finding the interesting pattern in database, the government can also mark buildings inside school campuses in the Geographical Information System (GIS), and reengineering the emergency preparedness planning for promote rescue response. Based on the result of the association method, we then use multi-objective linear programming for calculating different kind of resources for emergency rescue. For example, material for rescue, facillities for health care, number of persons for emergency response and so on. Taking, labor cost and response time as multiple decision-making objective to achieve, and regarding the requirement of each material as restriction, a multi-objective linear programming method is then built.

Comparing to a common multi-objective linear programming, it incorporates the mechanism of weighting method as flow.

Objective function  Min  S = 			 ??? ii dPdPdP ...2211 ?  Restriction     Rcgddxaxaxa m  j iinn ????? ?  ?  ?  112211 ...

Tcgddxaxbxb m  j iinn ????? ?  ?  ? ?  222211 1  ... ?  Where iP  is priority of each objective, ix  is the  number of a certain kind of resource in the emergency  response center i, while ii ba ,  are material cost and labor  cost of the emergency response center i respectively. d+ d-  are difference variables. R and T are material requirement and labor requirement respectively in a basic emergency event. As far as weighting method is concerned, it  represents in the formule ? ?   m  i ii cg  , where ig  represents the value set of an association rule, and ic  is  the confidence of this rule. of traditional multi-objective linear programming regards emergency reponse center scattered in different place as equal importance, and does not have scientific mechanism to measure the difference of the centers. While our proposed multi-objective linear programming with weighting mechanism resolved this problem by incorporating spatial data association mining method.

This paper took spatial predicates into the analytical process of emergency management. Spatial predicates between an emergency spot and the surrounding objects were incorporated into  attributes of emergency events.a spatial data association algorithm and linear programming method were combined to achieve spatially enabled emergency analysis. Our method can identify different emergency condition based on the geographical clues implied in the spatial association rules, and help goverment to efficiently realize the objectives of emergency resource reengineering.

Nevertheless, although we have achieved promising results, our research on spatially enabled emergency analysis could be further explored and studied. We plan to propose a spatial data clustering method for selecting the sites for the centers of emergency rescue, as well as a spatial route detection method for identifying emergency dispersion, among others.
