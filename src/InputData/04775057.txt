Abstract-In order to accelerate imaging process and lower overall system cost, many practical CT systems use single slice detectors and big-pitch helical scanning, especially in next generation Baggage Scanning system. In this paper, we present a reconstruction strategy for this kind of systems. We researched on the imaging qualities resulting from different scanning parameters, especially the thickness of the detectors. The experimental study is both on simulation data and experimental data. We found out that reconstruction results from relatively thicker detectors are better than those from thinner detectors.

We also compared post-processing methods of single dimensional smoothing and multi-dimensional smoothing in improving the imaging quality for such resulting reconstructions from single- slice-detector helical CT (SSDHCT). Finally, an implementation scheme of the reconstruction algorithm and post-processing using the latest GPU is presented. We achieve a 10 times speedup and the performance meets the requirement for practical applications. At last, we produced a sample machine using this technique, and get some real baggage scanning result. Our method works effectively in reality applications.

I. INTRODUCTION  A s we know, China just held the 29 th Olympic Games  successfully. It is a wonderful memory to China and the whole world. A lot of people devoted much in this event. We should also know that, the success of the Olympic not only relies on the effort of athletes, volunteers and organizers, but also, on the sound and safe environment guaranteed by the advanced security system. The baggage scanning is used widely in nowadays' security inspection, especially since the last 10 years. But recognition can't be done automatically on the overlapped image from a DR inspecting system. CT type baggage scanning system becomes a good option.

To lower system cost and make the device compact, some of the resent baggage CTs use single slice detectors. With the limited thickness of detector slice and requirement of high throughput, the pitch of such a helical CT is usually big. The targeted advantage is clear: lower price, fewer data storage, shorter scanning time and lower radiation dose [4]. However, the projection data is seriously incomplete, usually 1/20th - 1/40th of the complete data acquired by traditional helical CT systems. Therefore, different from the traditional systems,  Manuscript received November 10, 2008. This work was supported grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 10575059, No.

While the pitch is fixed, in order to get a better quality, how do we decide the thickness of the detectors? What processing methods will improve the image quality?

2. How can we accelerate the reconstruction and post processing to meet real-time applications, such as interactive visualization and some vision tasks?

This paper addresses on three main issues we worked on for the fast SSDHCT imaging. Firstly, we briefly illustrate a helical CT reconstruction algorithm using a look up table to get an approximate volumetric reconstruction; secondly, examination on different detector thickness and post- processing methods are illustrated; at last, all the operations are implemented using GPU, and the method is tested on a real sample machine.



II. EFFECT OF DETECTOR THICKNESS AND POST-PROCESSING  To study the effect of detector thickness on image of reconstruction, we did experiments on two choices of detector.

The results are shown in Fig.1 and Fig.2. In Fig.!, the reconstruction is from a full helical scan with multi-slice detector. The projection data are as many as 160M bytes. Fig.2 is the reconstruction using single slice detector CT of thin and thick detector. There are only 8M bytes data in projection which are only 2% ofthe full coverage case.

Clearly, the reconstructions suffer significant helical artifacts for the cases of SSDHCT. The result from thick detectors is visually better. Thicker detector averages information of the data. Therefore, when the volume structure is not too small to     be distinguished by the detector, the structure can be seen clearly in the reconstruction without being disturbed by artifacts. In the baggage scanning application, our purpose is to discover the danger, which is usually a scale region of a special material, so the result may satisfy our requirement.

In order to make the result more recognizable, a smoothing filter should be applied after reconstruction. In our work, we examined the effects of two kinds of filters: a Z axis smooth kernel, and a three dimension smooth kernel.

III. ACCELERATING THE RECONSTRUCTION ON A GPU  In order to fit the GPU pipeline, we use a lookup table in the back projection (LUTBP)  dsin(y+B)arctan --------'----- b+d*cos(y+B) +0.5  a U=  -......_..._....-. ~~ Fig.6: Pipeline of GPU-LUT Back Projection  As we can see in Figure 3, 4 and 5, the filtering result from three dimension smoothing is better than the result from smoothing along Z axis only. After filtration, the artifacts can be much reduced and give a much improved reconstruction.

After the LUTBP on GPU, the result is stored in a 30- texutre 0, three dimensional image smoothing can also be directly implemented on the GPU right away, and the result can be shown immediately through ray casting or other volume rendering method. Thus, all the data processing is completed within GPU. We compared the performance on speed between a CPU and a GPU. Obviously, the GPU gains more than 10 times speed-up.

On a CPU, the lookup table will faster the helical CT reconstruction to some extend; but on a GPU, it can be used to achieve a big amount of speed-up[5].

Since the calculation of every pixel in every slice is independent in the LUTBP, the computation can be easily paralleled. We implement it on a GPU so that the processing will be executed in 128 cores at the same time. The pipeline of GPU based LUTBP is shown in Fig.6.

V. REAL PRODUCT EXPERIMENT  Based on the enough information and speed, we produced a sample machine, THSCAN I080XT. It consists ofa SSDHCT part and a DR part; both the parts can do dual-energy scanning to recognize the material.

From the result, we can see that SSDHCT result is good enough for us to recognize each object, and the result from a thicker detector is smoother. Meanwhile, thicker detector can also reduce the system noise. So in the product, we choose the thicker detector.

IV. EXPERIMENTALRESULT  We did experiments on our laboratory CT systems. A can of gum is scanned. In the full helical scan with multi-slice detector, the size of projection data is 890M bytes. In the SSDHCT the size of the ro?ection data is 44M b es.

Fig.IO: THSCAN l080XT  Fig.II(a) is our testing baggage. It contains some daily stuff, such as food, water, shampoo, cigarette and clothes, and also, some dangerous objects, Hexogen, Nitroglycerine, scissors and knife. Fig.II (b) is the regular DR scanning result, it has a good resolution but objects are overlapped. It is impossible for computer to find the dangerous objects automatically in this image.

The second part of the machine scans the baggage with SSDHCT. It outputs a helical projection data as in Fig.1I(c). It is only about 14Mb, while for an exact Helical CT reconstruction we need about 500Mb projection data. Then we reconstruct it with 0 ur method and get a approximate result showed in Fig.II (d). This picture is not as beautiful as the DR image. Like the simulation result, it is inaccurate but still ok for us to count the objects..But actually in the real operation, operators don't look at it by themselves. This picture is for the computer vision. Only base on this data computer can do the detection automatically because it is a 3D volume data. It is much easier for computer vision method to understand this image than the overlapped DR image.

The two slices of the baggage in Fig.I2(a) are from an exact CT scanning. With the material information, we can recognize the dangerous objects. The two slices in Fig.12(b) are from our SSDHCT scanning, although they are blurred and inaccurate, we can still find the danger correctly with same method. So, in terms of function, our method and product work as well as an exact CT to this application.

In this system, we use a NVIDIA G280GTX graphic card to run our LUTBP method. The average reconstruction speed is about 3s depends on the size of the baggage. The test baggage in Fig.II cost 4.7s in the reconstruction. So the speed is fast enough for the reality application.

VI. CONCLUSION  We proposed a fast imaging technique by a single-slice- detector helical CT used in baggage scanning. The system is of low cost and fast scanning speed and the choice of thickness of the detector greatly affects the image quality. The method and data processing proposed here helps to obtain a reasonable good quality volumetric image of the object with computation accelerated by GPU. These advantages make it meet the real time requirements of practical baggage scanning CT applications with low cost. From both numerical and real- system experiments, we demonstrated the effects of the methods. The product now is already running in some important place of China.
