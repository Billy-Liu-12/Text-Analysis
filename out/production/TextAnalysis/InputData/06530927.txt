Abstract?Astronomical image data acquisition under low light conditions causes higher noise occurrence in these data. There are a lot of noise sources including also the thermally generated noise (dark current) inside used astronomical CCD sensor and the Poisson noise of the photon flux. There are specific image quality criteria in astronomy. These criteria are derived from the algorithms for astronomical image processing and are specific in the field of multimedia signal processing. Astrometric and photometric algorithms provide information about stellar objects: their brightness profile (PSF), position and magnitude.

They could fail because of lower SNR. This problem can be solved by subtraction a dark frame from a captured image nowadays. However, this method couldn't work properly in systems with shorter shutter speed and nonlinear sensitivity, such as for example the system MAIA (Meteor Automatic Imager and Analyser). Image data from these system could not been processed by conventional algorithms. Denoising of the astronomical images is therefore still a big challenge for astronomers and people who process astronomical data.

Therefore usage of other denoising algorithms is proposed in this paper. We describe our experiences with astronomical image data denoising based on Curvelet and Starlet transform. Novel algorithms have been tested on image data from MAIA system.

Their influence on important photometric data like stellar magnitude and FWHM (Full Width at Half Maximum) has been studied and compared with conventional denoising methods.

I.  INTRODUCTION Many discrete wavelet transform algorithms have been  recently developed [1, 2]. The most widely-known one is certainly the orthogonal transform, proposed by Mallat [3] and its bi-orthogonal version [4]. Using the orthogonal wavelet transform, digital signal s can be decomposed as follows [5]  where ?  and ? are respectively the scaling function and the wavelet function. J is the number of resolutions used in the decomposition, wj are the wavelet (or detail) coefficients at scale j, cJ is a coarse or smooth version of the original signal s, k represents time axis and l is a time shift. Thus, the algorithm  outputs J+1 subband arrays. The indexing is such that j = 1 corresponds to the finest scale (high frequencies).

While the bi-orthogonal wavelet transform leads to successful implementation in image compression techniques, results are not convenient for data analysis (e.g., denoising, deconvolution, object detection). This is mainly due to the loss of the translation-invariance property in the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) realized by the Mallat algorithm [1], leading to a large number of artifacts when an image is reconstructed after modification of its wavelet coefficients.

For this reason, astronomers and physicists have generally preferred to work with the continuous wavelet transform, even if the cost to be paid is a considerable amount of redundancy in the transformation and there is no reconstruction operator [5].

For some application, such as fractal analysis or object detection, these drawbacks have no impact because there is no need to apply a reconstruction. For other applications, in which reconstruction is needed, some researchers have chosen an undecimated version of the wavelet transform implemented by a very efficient way using so called ? trous algorithm [5,6], where this French term means ?with holes?. This kind of the isotropic undecimated wavelet transform is also called the Starlet transform [7].

A series of recent papers [8,9], however, argued that wavelets and related classical multiresolution ideas deal with a limited dictionary made up of roughly isotropic elements occurring at all scales and locations. Moreover, these dictionaries do not exhibit highly anisotropic elements (e.g.

curves and edges). Following on this topic, Cand?s and Donoho introduced new multiscale systems like curvelets [7] and ridgelets [8]. Curvelets and ridgelets take the form of base elements which exhibit very high directional sensitivity and are highly anisotropic. In two-dimensions, for instance, curvelets are localized along curves, in three dimensions along sheets, etc.



II. METHODS USED FOR IMAGE DENOISING As was mentioned above, two methods the curvelet  transform and the starlet transform were used for image denoising.

III. MAIA SYSTEM MAIA (Meteor Automatic Imager and Analyzer) system is  an evolution of current analog solution of system for double station observation of the meteors, which is equipped with the gigabit Ethernet camera JAI CM-040 with 1/2" progressive scan CCD sensor, image intensifier and Pentax SMS FA 1.4/50 mm lens as the input element of the optical system [12]. All these components (Fig. 3) contribute to the optical aberrations and non-uniform noise occurrence, which is especially caused by non-uniform sensitivity of the image intensifier.

Conventional algorithms for image denoising could be used in this case, but they are not efficient enough. Therefore, the novel denoising methods are proposed.



IV. ASTRONOMICAL IMAGE DENOISING  A. Conventional algorithm in astronomy Denoising of captured astronomical images is generally  performed by subtracting so called dark frame from these data.

Dark frame is an image acquired with the sensor in the dark (when the input aperture is closed), essentially just an image of noise inside the image sensor. This noise consists almost of the thermally generated noise inside the CCD sensor.

Figure 3.  MAIA system design    Another image called flat field could be used in addition to the dark frame. Noise suppression is not a general purpose of acquired image, flat field is used to correct pixel-to-pixel variations in the CCD response as well as any nonuniform illumination of the detector itself.  In our case, we will divide the captured image by the normalized flat field to avoid the microchannel structure of the image intensifier.

However, the collection of dark frame and flat field couldn't work properly in systems with shorter shutter speed and nonlinear sensitivity, such is our system MAIA. Denoising methods based on starlet and curvelet transform were therefore tested.

B. Denoising using Starlet and Curvelet transform The way to remove noise from image data is to perform the  thresholding of starlet or curvelet coefficients of the processed image after corresponding transform. Thresholding is a method which determines significance of the coefficients. If appropriate coefficient is larger than a threshold, it is significant, otherwise it is not.

Let us see on the hard coefficients thresholding. Let suppose, that CCD sensor receives more than 40 photons during image acquisition, thus the Poisson noise distribution accumulate inside the sensor becomes almost indistinguishable from the Gaussian [13]. Given stationary Gaussian noise, it suffices to compare the wavelet coefficients wj,l (j ? decomposition level, l ? index of pixel) to the Gaussian noise standard deviation ?j :    Often k is chosen as 3 because of empirical rule which states that for a normal distribution, nearly all values (about 99.7%) lie within 3 standard deviations of the mean. If wj,l is small, it is not significant and could be due to noise. If wj,l is large, it is significant and is due to the useful signal.

So, it is necessary to estimate, in the case of Gaussian noise models, the noise standard deviation at each decomposition scale j. The appropriate value of ?j in the succession of the starlet or curvelet is assessed from the standard deviation of the noise ?s in the original data s, and from study of the noise in the starlet / curvelet space. This study consists of simulating a data set containing Gaussian noise with a standard deviation equal to 1, and taking the starlet / curvelet transform of this data set [5]. Then the standard deviation ?ej is computed at each decomposition level. Due to the properties of the multiresolution approach, the noise standard deviation at scale j of the data is equal to the noise standard deviation of the original image ?s multiplied by the noise standard deviation at scale j of the simulated data ?j = ?s ?ej . Table I gives the ?ej values for the 2D starlet transform using the cubic B3 spline scaling filter [5].

Shutter speed used in MAIA system is 1/60 s which is a very short period of time. Longer exposure times however could not be used because the main purpose of the MAIA system is to precisely record trajectory of meteor?s fall, which could take just fraction of second.

There is image processing using the starlet transform left.

Its denoising properties are better than in case of dark frame subtraction method and worse than in case of the curvelet transform. Nevertheless, if we look at the Tab. III, we can affirm that the Starlet transform damages scientific astronomical data least than other two techniques.  Magnitude and FWHM deviations of almost all selected stellar objects are within the allowed range (1 for FWHM and 0.3 for magnitude).

Artifacts caused by starlet coefficients thresholding are not as strong as artifacts contained in reconstructed image after curvelet transform denoising (Fig. 6).  Thus, the Starlet transform is the most suitable method for noise suppression in  astronomical images acquired by our nonlinear system with shorter shutter speed.
