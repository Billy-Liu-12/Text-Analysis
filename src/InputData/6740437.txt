I. INTRODUCTION  From the foundational view, a ?Big Data? is a set of data that is so large that any brutal force combinatorial analysis is practically impossible. So, we believe, any appropriate mathematical model concerning ?Big Data? should be an infinite model. A granular computing (GrC) approach of a mathematical framework for ?knowledge mining in Big Data? is illustrated by using some idea from algebraic geometry:  1) ?Big Data? modeling: For example, the ring of the integers Z, denoted by Z, is a mathematical model U of ?Big Data? in this example.

2) ?MAP? modeling: The selection of the set of prime ideals is a mathematical model of granulating ?Big Data? U into granular structure (GrS).

3) ?REDUCE? modeling: To compute the hidden geo- metric structure of Spec(Z) (e.g., Zariski topology) is to extract the GrS into quotient structure (QS)  4) ?Interpret? modeling: The quotient structure is inter- preted into knowledge structure.

Granular computing is essentially both a computing method and a theory and methodology of ?divide and con- quer?. It is inspired by algebraic geometry, general topology and hypergraph theory. The idea of granular computing is to divide complex information or data naturally into small pieces with known and basic knowledge. Each natural, small and basic piece is called a granule, or an information granule by Zadeh(1996) [8]. What are the interesting ?thing? among those basic granules? Maybe the size, the function, or the structure. In this paper, the structure is our interesting thing, especially its geometric structure (knowledge structure).

Following the idea, we view Big Data as an infinite data set first and attack it by granular computing theory to obtain its mathematical model including information granules in the infinite data as basic knowledge and the structure of the knowledge. The latter (knowledge structure) hidden in big data will be expressed by finitary mathematical structure, not by the combinatoric brute force computing.

The strategy is that the Big Data can be granulated into granules of data that represent certain basic (pieces of) knowledge. In general, we can only capture the granular knowledge of the whole big data. Here, we do assume that each granule is simple enough to be understood and can be regarded as a piece of basic knowledge. Our general goal is to mine the knowledge structure of the big data set, which can be corresponded from the granular structure. Our approach is to deal with Big Data by means of granular computing based on the lessons learned from algebraic geometry; we shall call it the covering granular computing model.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

Algebraic geometry is taken as the fundamental of granular computing theory. In Section II, we discuss the knowledge mining in the case of the Integer Set from the viewpoint of algebraic geometry. In Section III, the covering gran- ular computing model of the big data set is developed       following the footsteps of algebraic geometry. The model has three essential structures, namely, granular structure, quotient structure and knowledge structure. Granular struc- ture corresponds the algebraic structure. Quotient structure corresponds the geometric structure, which is the interactive among the points abstracting from the corresponding gran- ules. Knowledge structure depends on the engineering ap- plications where the meaningful names have been assigned to each point in the quotient structure. The conclusions are drawn in Section IV. It summarized the contributions we have done and our future work.



II. KNOWLEDGE MINING FROM ALGEBRAIC GEOMETRY  A. Brief Overview of Algebraic Geometry  It is possible to associate a ?geometric? object to an arbitrary commutative ring ?Z? (the ring of integers) based on [10]. This object is called as Spec(Z), which is insisted to be commutative and have the unit element 1.

Definition 1: Spec(Z) [10] Spec(Z) = the set of prime ideals P * Z [Z itself is not  counted as a prime ideal but (0), if prime, is counted].

where [P] is written the element of Spec(Z) given by the  prime ideal P. It distinguishes between P as an ideal in Z, and [P] as a point in Spec(Z).

Considering the point set Spec(Z), all points have the entanglement among themselves depending on the intersec- tion1 operation of any two prime ideals.

Remark 1: Based on the well-known fundamental theo- rem of ideal theory2 for Z, the production of two ideals equals to the ideal of the product of corresponding genera- tors.

In particular, the intersection of any two prime ideals of Z equals to the ideal of the product of the corresponding prime numbers.

Example 1: Here illustrate the three cases of the intersec- tion of any two or three prime ideals of Z(  )  = ( ) ? ( ) =  ( ) =  ( )(  )  = ( ) ? ( ) =  ( 2 ? 3  )(  ) =  ( ) ? ( ) ? ( ) =  ( ) ? ( ) =  ( 2 ? 3  ) Secondly, define a topology on Spec(Z), Definition 2: Zariski Topology [10] Closed sets = sets of the form {[P]|P ? I} for some  ideal I ? Z. This set will be denoted by V (I).

It is clearly that the collection of closed subsets {V (I)}  does define a topology, called the Zariski Topology.

In Subsection II-B, we will employ the prime ideals in  Z to generate other ideals by means of the ?intersection?  1Intersection: If A and B are ideals, so is A?B. This operation is commutative and associative.

2The fundamental theorem of ideal theory: every nonzero proper ideal in the ring of integers Z admits unique factorization into a product of nonzero prime ideals.

operation [9] and construct the semigroup structure over Z.

And then, translating the semigroup (algebraic structure) to a multiplication table over Spec(Z) and the multiplication ta- ble corresponds the Zariski Topology (geometric structure).

B. Mining Structure From the Integers by Algebraic Geom- etry  Here and in Subsection III-B, we will illustrate how to mine the knowledge structure from an example with Integer Set Z by means of algebraic geometry and covering granular computing theory respectively.

We will start from the algebraic structure of Z to find the geometric structure in Spec(Z)(see in Definition 1). The geometric structure represents the proper knowledge in Z.

First step: Picking up the prime ideals from the integer set Z such that  ( ) , ( ) , ( ) , ( ) , ( ) , ? ? ?, and operating  the intersection among them.

Second step: Operating the intersection on the prime  ideals can generate the ?new subsets? (ideals) of Z, and adding the new subsets into Table I which forms a semigroup on Z, shown in Table I (Page 3).

Third step: Abstracting the prime ideals into points, there is Spec(Z)=  {[( )]  , [( )]  , [( )]  , [( )]  , [( )]  ,? ? ?, }  . So do the generated ideals.

Mapping the intersection operation to the multiplication operation, we can obtain the multiplication table on Spec(Z) with new components as shown in Table II (Page 3).

Observing: In Table II, there is Zariski Topology on Spec(Z). The new component in in Table II and the points in Spec(Z) can be expressed by the closed set in Zariski Topology such that [(  )]  = {[(  )]}[(  )]  = {[(  )]}[(  )]  = {[(  )]}[(  )]  = {[(  )]}[(  )]  = {[(  )]}  ? ? ?[( )]  ? [( )]  = {[(  )] , [( )]}[(  )]  ? [( )]  = {[(  )] , [( )]}[(  )]  ? [( )]  = {[(  )] , [( )]}  ? ? ?[( )]  ? [(  )] =  {[( )] , [( )]}  ? ? ?[( )]  ? [( ) ? [(  )] =  {[( )] , [( )] , [(  )]} ? ? ?  Till now, we finish pulling the knowledge out of Z. The knowledge is captured as the Zariski Topology on a new universe generated by Spec(Z).

where ( ) ?  ( )  is NOT a new subset because ( ) ?  ( )  = ( )  has already existed, so does as ( i ) ?  ( j )  = ( j )  iff ( i ) ?  ( j )  .

Whereas ( ) ?  ( )  is the new subset ( )  , so does ( i ) ?  ( j )  = ( i ? j  ) iff i and j are co-prime.

As Table I tells, [(  )]  ? [(  )]  is correspondingly NOT a new point, whereas [(  )]  ? [(  )]  is the new point.

Keeping it in mind, we will revisit the example by means of the granular computing theory and can mine the same knowledge in Z.



III. KNOWLEDGE MINING BY MEANS OF GRANULAR COMPUTING  Granular computing theory is a sort of intelligent com- puting theory which can deal with the uncertain problem, but are different from fuzzy set, rough set, and interval computing. Zaden and Lin has proposed the concept of ?Granular Computing (GrC)? in 1998. Afterwards, Lin has  done a lot of fundamental research to GrC and outlined the frame of the granular computing theory with nine types models with respect to the different applications [14]. In this paper, we work at translating GrC into the language of algebraic geometry and set up the theoretical foundation of GrC.

The core thought of GrC is the neighborhood system, which is inspired by General Topology. Let us recall it first in this section.

Definition 3: Neighborhood System [11], [12], [13]     Let U be a classical set. Let NS be a mapping, called a neighborhood system (NS),  NS : U ? 2P (U),  where P (U) is the family of all crisp/fuzzy subsets of U . 2P (U) is the family of all crisp subsets of P (U). In other words, NS associates each point x ? U a family NS(x) of subsets of U . Such a family NS(x) is called a neighborhood system3 at x, where the element of NS(x) is called neighborhood of x, denoted by N(x).

A. A Quick Glance of Covering Granular Computing Model  Let U be the universe and C={C1, C2, ? ? ?, Ci, ? ? ? } be a family of subsets. The ordered pair (U, C) is called the 2nd GrC Model or the Global GrC Model [14]. The C, some time, is referred to as a partial covering (PCov).

Global/2nd GrC Model is a generalization of topology by simply dropping the (global) axioms4 of topology.

We can easily verify that the covering is more complex than the binary relation or the n-ary relation through the example of the Social Networking Services (SNS), where the universe of discourse U is the set of people and the covering C is the e-Community or social community which people are in.

Definition 4: Neighborhood System of a covering [11], [12], [14], [15]  Let U be the universe of discourse, x?U , and C be a covering of U , where C={Ci|Ci ? C, Ci ? U}. The set N(x) is called the neighborhood of x such that N(x)=Ci, where x ? Ci, Ci?C. The family of N(x) is called the neighborhood system of x such that NS(x)={Ci|x ? Ci}.

Here we give an explicit example as follows.

Example 2: Let U={a, b, c, d, e} be the universe of dis-  course, and let C={C1, C2, C3} be a partial covering of U , where C1={a, b, c}, C2={a, b, d} and C3={c, d} are given.

Thus, we can write the neighborhood and neighborhood system of each point of U as shown in Table III.

Note that the element Ci in the covering C takes the role of the prime ideal in Spec(Z) and can be denoted by generator set in Definition 5.

Definition 5: Generator Set Let U be the universe (can be infinite or finite) and C be  the given covering (can be infinite or finite), each member in C is called the generator set of U , which can generate new members over a (some) mathematical operation(s).

Note that in the Second GrC Model, we employ the generator sets to build up the neighborhood system of each  3Note that the neighborhood system presented in the paper is loosened without the ?topological? condition of topological neighborhood system by Sierpinski [16]. The biggest difference is to allow the empty set as the neighborhood system of points in a universe of discourse.

4The (global) axiom is: a collection of subsets that is closed under finite intersections and arbitrary unions is called topology and the subsets are called open sets.

Table III THE N AND NS OF EACH POINT IN U , GIVEN THE COVERING C  Point Neighborhood (N(?)) Neighborhood System (NS(?))  a N(a)=C1 and C2 NS(a)={C1, C2}  b N(b)=C1 and C2 NS(b)={C1, C2}  c N(c)=C1 and C3 NS(c)={C1, C3}  d N(d)=C2 and C3 NS(d)={C2, C3}  e N(e)=? NS(e)={?}  element in U , then it is the covering granular computing model.

Definition 6: Granule Set Let U be the universe and C be the given covering,  the family of the generator sets and all the new-generated components through the generator sets is called the granule set of U , denoted by G. The element of G is called the granule, which can be infinite or finite.

Definition 7: Quotient Set Let U be the universe, C be the given covering and G be  the granule set of U , we call the set of all the points as the quotient set, such that abstracting from members of G correspondingly.

Definition 8: Derived Partition Let U be the universe and C be the given covering, the  points which have the same largest neighborhood system form a center set. The family of the center set is called the derived partition.

To go further with the presented covering granular com- puting model, Lin has defined the mathematical structures generated by the given covering [14].

Definition 9: Granular Structure (GrS) GrS is the algebraic structure of the collection of granules,  where these granules are visible.

Definition 10: Quotient Structure (QS) QS is the geometric structure of the collection of granules,  in which each granule is abstracted into a point of a set, but the interactions among granules are preserved.

Definition 11: Knowledge Structure (KS) By giving each point in the quotient structure a mean-  ingful symbol then the named QS is called a knowledge structure (KS).

The neighborhoods of each element in universe U consists of the generator sets of the given covering C, which are taken as the granules in covering granular computing model.

The neighborhood system of each element in U shows the granular structure among the granules. The quotient structure can be represented into the simplicial complex. The knowledge structure can be defined into different meanings due to different applications.

B. Revisiting of Integers to Mine the Knowledge in Spec(Z)?Guiding Significance to Covering Granular Com- puting Model  The Integer Set, Z, can be considered as a ?partial covering? where the union of all the prime ideals cannot cover the integer 1. The family of prime ideals is given as the covering (known knowledge) and each prime ideal is the generator set.

By Definition 5, 9, 10 and 11, the GrS of Z consists of the generators (all the prime ideals) and all the new components generated by generator sets over the multiplication operation.

Its QS is the points when abstracting all the granules in GrS.

The corresponding KS is assigning a meaningful symbol to each point in QS.

It can be claimed that the ?semi-group? is the GrS of Z.

By means of Definition 4, one can view Z as the universe  and the collection of prime ideals as a covering; we studied the neighborhood system of each integer as shown Table IV in Page 6, where Z+ denotes the positive integers, and the negative integers are symmetric to the positive integers, therefore, the negative integers have the same neighborhood system as their opposite numbers.

In Table IV (Page 6), we can obtain the center set- s such as {0}, {1}, {2, 4, 8, ? ? ? , }, {3, 9, 27, ? ? ? , }, ? ? ?, {6, 12, 18, 36, ? ? ? , }, ? ? ?, which form a unique derived par- tition of Z as DP=  { {0}, {1}, {2, 4, 8, ? ? ? , }, {3, 9, 27, ? ? ? , }, ? ? ?,  {6, 12, 18, 36, ? ? ? , }, ? ? ?, }  Furthermore, the one-for-one corresponding between the closed sets in Zariski Topology and the center sets in the derived partition as shown in Table V.
