I.  INTRODUCTION The objects of processing equipment combat simulation  data association rules are most decision-making tables. The discrete process of equipment, combat simulation data sets on the properties, in essence, is a certain process of using threshold attribute in space division.



II. PROPOSAL OF ALGORITHM On the basis that density distribution function based  clustering algorithm, in order to avoid the algorithm in the order of the discretization on the property unreasonable for the equipment combat simulation data set attribute discretization and complex, association, property diversity and other characteristics, this paper, based on the attribute importance and incompatible with the degree of attribute discretization algorithm, this algorithm is a supervised local discretization method, and give full consideration to the equipment operational characteristics of the simulated data sets.

The algorithm by clustering the every need of discretization of condition attributes divide and through the calculation of the incompatibility of the decision table based on the clustering divided feedback to dynamically adjust cluster parameters until the level of the decision table is  incompatible with the original. Therefore, the algorithm is able to disperse continuous attribute more accurately, so that the data set information may not be lost to ensure the effect of discretization.



III. PROCESS DESCRIPTION Attribute discretization algorithm based on attribute  importance and the degree of incompatibility is mainly divided into two steps:  Input: decision table S = <U-, A, V, f>, where U is the discourse domain; DCA = . And ?=DC ; where },,,{ 21 nxxxU = },,,{ 21 mcccC = .cI  are the discrete attributes, D is decision attribute.

Output: the discrete decision-making table.

First, operate on the importance of each continuous  attribute to calculate the properties of each condition. Then, based on comparisons of the importance of the condition attributes from small to large to sort through the definition of 1.14 [5] to determine the importance and comparison of condition attributes;  Second, initial value by the formula (1-2) [5] to calculate each attribute's initial incompatibility; Then, repeat the following steps:  a. For properties(i=1,2,?,m)and the initial threshold? , Each property in need of discretization, in accordance with the order of the initial division of the data set is divided into a division of U;  b. Cluster each division and local cluster; c. Computing discrete (1-2) after the property  incompatible; d. If ??? ?? 0ii then i = i +1 , otherwise go to step e;  e.If ??? >? 0ii ,then change the value of? ,and go to step a.

DOI 10.1109/CSSS.2012.35     Among them,if the value of ? is ??? >? 0ii  then adjustments are as follows: if ??? +> 0ii ,then  1?= ??? If ??? +? 0ii ,then ??? = ; ?  says each time step to adjust the threshold.

In this paper, the original fixed? ,the value of design variable step way, step factor A variable amount (usually 1<? <10 The initial value of k adjust the threshold number of times). Thus, the algorithm through dynamic adjustment of clustering parameters ? incompatible with the degree of adjustment, can be more rapid, accurate, Discrete better.

Variable step size formula is defined as follows:  '2' 1?? ?= k (1-1) Therefore, if ??? +> 0ii  11 )2( ??= ??? k ; If  i i? ? ?? + 1(2 )k? ? ??=  Finally, the improved properties of the discretization interval with Boolean encoding method numerical code.



IV. ALGORITHM AND ANALYSIS A good discretization algorithm is able to balance  efficiency and accuracy between the two, rather than individual emphasis, the one [2, 6, 7].

A. experimental design and procedures Verify that the paper presents the discrete algorithm to  select the discretization of continuous attributes in two typical algorithms: width algorithm and CAIM (Class- Attribute Interdependence Maximization) [8] algorithm based on the attribute importance and incompatible properties of discrete algorithm in Table 3-1 [5] carried out a detailed comparative experiment.

The experimental procedure is as follows: First, using a variety of discrete algorithm and SVM support vector machine method to build the classifier training set and test set classification learning. get classification results. Kernel computation, the larger the property values will lead to computational complexity, training time is longer, so this attribute value normalization processing, such as the type (1- 2) as shown:  min( )2 1 max( ) min( )  i i i  i i  x xx x x ?= ?  ? ( 1-2 )  Normalized attribute value ]1,1[??ix .Training samples and test samples were the same normalization method.
