As the unique professional organization of national real  estate, CIREA makes an important role in the improvement of profession actions and the regulation of enterprises and practitioners. With the rapid development of these two businesses, there are an increasing number enterprises coming up, and the amount of related practitioners is also growing. In another word, the more complex situation, that CIREA has to deal with, is a big challenge. The accumulation of massive  information, from not only the enterprises but also the related people, demands for an effective and sufficient management system to be established.

B. Real Estate Appraisers and Agents Qualifying Examination National Real Estate Appraisers Qualifying Examination,  which is one of the earliest qualifying examinations, starts from 1995, and has been already held 14 times successfully. After a few years, National Real Estate Agents Qualifying Examination begins to run from 2002, and also has been hosted 8 times without a mistake. To sum up, there are more than five hundred thousand people attending the two kinds of exams, and among of them, seventy thousand get the pass.

C. Registration and Audit Qualification The registration of real estate appraisers and the audit  qualification of real estate enterprises take an important position in field of real estate. And the audit qualification routine even gets the permission to be integrated into General Office of the State Council of the People?s Republic of China.

In this field, the registration for appraisers has a necessary connection with the level of appraise enterprises, and the qualification for enterprises also deeply influent the appraisers, so they are linked and survived by each other. Also, time restriction is demanded. From what has been discussed above, the conclusion can be drawn that information management system is highly required, and it is impossible to deal with the complex routine work with a huge number of wild data everyday without it.



II. AIM AND CONTENT OF INDUSTRIAL INFORMATION SYSTEM  A. Aim of Industrial Information System Based on the regulation of registered appraisers and  enterprises, CIREA has already begun to computerize and systematize the historical files. With the advanced operation system and web technology, the industrial information system includes the basic data from all the related enterprises, appraisers, agents, annual examinations, registration log, future education per year and so on. This huge information system not   DOI 10.1109/ICEE.2010.129     only can integrate all data into one database, but also share the documents. The aftermath of the integrated data is auto- analysis and auto-statistics for different levels of work staff, and related results can effectively help the administrators to make quick decisions and be taken as a convincing preference.

As a result of the integration, a large number of information can be public through the web, and the people who have the need to inquire can research and also supervise the appraisers, agents and enterprises.

B. Content of Industrial Information System Real Estate Appraise and Agency Information System, with  the core of management system, can be divided into seven sub- systems:  Top Management System Real Estate Appraises Registration System Real Estate Appraises Credit System Real Estate Agents Registration System Real Estate Agents Credit System Real Estate Enterprise Qualifying System Qualifying Examination System Based-Internet Future Education System  TABLE I.  SYSTEM FRAMEWORK  Real Estate Appraise and Agency Information System Access Control  Appraises Registration System Initiate, Alter, Continue Enterprise Qualifying System Initiate Appraises Credit System Management Agents Registration System Initiate, Alter, Continue Agents Credit System Management Examination System Subject, Grade Future Education System Appraises and Agents both Option Maintain, Service, Type,  Admin, Access, Guideline Data Transfer Platform   Due to that the seven sub-systems run on their own  database, they also share important data from the integrated database. Although their using-fields are quite different and independent, they have linked data-circle and stop the repeating inputs from labor. Efficiency and using rate of information get highly improved.



III.  INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FRAMEWORK Industrial Information Management System is divided into  four operation patterns (Chart1). In this way, users are convenient to operate, and the information could be easier to be collected. At the same time, the accuracy of information is highly protected in a high level, thus different departments share the standard and unique data automatically. Based on this pattern, the circle of process is diminished, while the difficulty and frequency to protect the sync data is much less than usual.

It can be easily drew the conclusion that the efficiency is highly improved.

TABLE II.  INDUSTRIAL INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ORGANIZED-FRAMEWORK  Users Actions  Appliers Register on the website  Province  Audit the information and summary; Supervise the qualification of the appliers; Administrate the statue  Ministry Final Audit the qualification; Get results of statistics  CIREA Administrate all the information and publish  Publish the National Appraisers/Agents/Enterprises on the web    A. Function of Appliers Management Not only the registration of qualification of Real Estate  Appraisers, but also the related Enterprises can be finished through the online system. When registered online, the existed information is consulted by the new users, so that the news could change the different blanks and identify essential part, and the process could have done. Based on the friendly experience, the people, who are not skillful at computers and typing, can also can register by themselves. Because of this, the information in the database becomes more accurate and easily identified. At the same time, the users, including the appraisers and enterprises, have the access to inquiry the status of the registration and qualification at any time they want through the system, and this progress not only convenient the users, but also the administrators.

B. Function of Province Management The qualifying system for real estate appraisers and  enterprises have the related function module for province management, so that the province administrators can immediately cancel the unqualified one, that they are not approved, before the ministry audits the application, and also get the new-update information as soon as they need. Besides the audit, there are much more function for the province:  Function of Audit mainly includes that: Registration, Qualification and Upload all the  information Supervise the related enterprise with the regulation  and the law, Maintain the local data, check, inquiry, even export  Based on these functions, every province has no need to develop their own information management system, and because of the unified platform, the national data is easy to regulate and update. As a result, the efficiency is highly improved, while the time for the specific work sharply decreases.

C. Function of Ministry Management As the industrial administration department, Ministry of  Construction of the People's Republic of China is in charge of this field, so the information management system has its own     version and function, which is familiar as the province system, such as audit, supervise, check and inquiry and so on.

D. Function of Industrial Organization The administration of this field has a great responsibility to  establish the standard, the database and maintain the process.

Despite that the information management system need to be updated regularly, synced data flawless, backed up at a certain frequency, also, with the development of the network security and new technology, new modules with highly-tech function has to be designed at the same time. Only in this way, the security and complete of the growing database could be guarded.

It has to be admitted that, the industrial organization has more responsibility than the province department, not only concentrate on the system design, but also is in charge of the data's standard, which includes the following:  Management, Update, Audit and Import to database Roll in the statue of future education Publish the result of examination and regulation on  time Modify the flaw information Manage the information of expert Access control Statistic and summary Backup per day and offsite  E. Function of  our society The two websites, "China Real Estate Appraiser" ?  http://www.ccret.org.cn) and "China Real Estate Agents" (http://www.agents.org.cn)? are belonging to CIREA, each citizen can search the information about the appraisers, agents and related enterprises on it. In this way, if a citizen needs to hire a appraiser to evaluate his house's market price, he can first get on the website to check that whether the appraiser has the certificate and how is the rank the enterprise. All the information can help citizens to make a better choice, of course, a security. The characteristic that has to be mentioned is that the database people can search is exactly sync with the database in the industrial information management system.

Therefore, at the maximum, the accuracy and real-time of data is compulsory.



IV. CHARACTERISTICS OF INDUSTRIAL INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM  A. Based on the regulation Based on the regulation published by Ministry of  Construction, the industrial information management system promotes the laws while publishes the system to the society all the time. When people log in the station, the related module presents the basic reason for the better understanding, including the society groups who search, and also the appraisers and administrators. Meanwhile, some parts that can be controlled by the program is designed into the system, and there is no way to be changed by people.

As an illustration, we may take this example: A real estate appraiser has to apply for continue certificate most three  months  before the validation expires, that is to say that,  before that date, your application will not be accepted by the website.

Like if the validation of Appraiser Wang expires on Dec 1st 2009, he only could apply for the continuous certificate after Sep 1st 2009, and before the date, when he log in the system, there will be no option for continuous operation. With this process by program, there will be no way to change the process, and efficiency avoids this kind of situation.

B. Plan as a whole, Take it step by step Because of the routine work in CIREA is in a huge number  and complex, the aim of the design of Industrial Information Management System is "Plan as a whole, take it step by step" at the initial. Begin from the routine work of CIREA, now the module has already enlarged with the functions of province and individual.

From 2004, the plan of the industrial information management system begins to take a step. And in 2005, the beta version of management system, which includes the basic function, got online. And until 2007, the Registration System for Appraisers and Agents, the Qualification for Enterprises, the Credit Document System, the Examination System and so on, has almost all finished the main function and put into use.

Encouragingly, the serial of system gained widely accepted. In 2008, the future education system is also designed successfully, and put online.

C. Regulate by levels, Clarify the responsibility Require by Ministry of Construction, Province department  has responsible to initially check the qualification of the appraisers and enterprises, then upload the information to Ministry for final qualification. The aftermath of this process, demands for the accurate access control and allocate the privilege.  In this mode, the flexible system has the function to give one department some rights, and give different departments one same privilege. Allocate clearly, and take certain responsibility  D. Unified platform, Avoid the isolated island As the integrated platform is formed by one main-system  and 7 sub-system, the database is shared and there would not be generated an isolated island. It has to be mentioned that, some sub-systems have relatively independency, and they don't change the data directly, but in the early development, the designers have already considered about this problem and draw a solution to fix it, which is to make a data interface for synchronization. In this way, administrators can import the information directly to the database of industrial information management system.

Take a case for example, every year there is an increasing number of people sign up the appraisers qualifying examination, but it is impossible that all of them pass the exam, so it has to be considered that if all the sign-up information is saved into the database, it become a kind of waste, and there will be some useless information in the database. To solve this problem, there is a way that only the information of people that successfully pass the examination will be imported into the database.

In the other hand, the information in a same database that a individual signs up, is initially checked by province department, and then is finally qualified by Ministry. In this way, the data could be unified all the time and unique.

E. Convenient in use, Publish in time The two websites, as we mentioned before, are two specific  field stations, also the open window of CIREA. In these two sites, there are a few parts connected with the national database, and provide check and search to the society all the time with the most updated information.

A good case in point is that about the registration of real estate registration. After the certificate is qualified by Ministry of Construction, the administrator in CIREA changes the status of the people in the database, and at the same time, the information provided by the station is also altered.

F. Offsite Backup, Double make sure the security The security of industrial information management system  is more important than any other data, because it is unified and, no one will deny that, unique. Once the data lost or is changed by hackers on the WEB, the result will be disastrous. To make sure the security of database, CIREA backups the information everyday, and at the same time, the offsite backup is also taken into measures, just to secure the data without any accident.

As far as today, the industrial information management system went through some interference of virus and attacks by hacker, but based on the steadily routine work, nothing lost.

G. Statistic at dawn, Improve efficiency There is an increasing number of data in the industrial  information management system, and also the frequency of inquiries is huge. To improve the speed of the inquiry, CIREA take a measure that only summarize and statistic the data at dawn, the index that builds in the morning then largely speeds the inquiry up. Then in the daytime, the only job that system needs to do is present the result and manifest.

H. Mobile-office, Show the beauty of time After the establishment of the industrial information  management system, a lot of work could be done through the internet anywhere, anytime. Even the administrators is going abroad, as long as there is a network connection of broad band, the routine work is easily finished. Registration online, Audit online, Qualification online. It is convenient for everyone

I. Summery With the development of the computer science technology,  based on the internet and information management system, Office Automation has achieved a highly standard. As an administrator in the industrial, a staff in a management department, not only we need to concentrate on our routine work, but also have to see the industry in the light of its  development. Take computer science technology into the growing of this industry, and apply for the business field more specifically. China Institution of Real Estate Appraisers and Agents (CIREA), as the management in this specific field, have a great advantage and irresistible responsibility.



V. THE FUTURE OF REAL ESTATE APPRAISE AND AGENTS INDUSTRIAL INFORMATION SYSTEM  After the present situation has been checked, the conclusion is easily summarized that, it has to be admitted that the digital level of this real estate appraisers and agents is successful until now, the users and administrators all are convenient to register and audit. But with no doubt that, it can?t be perfect, and there must be something that the industry could improve.

? With a increasing number of appraisers and agents, especially agents that just starts, the size of database server is highly demanded, and the related modules have to be designed in time before the system reaches the choke point.

? It is widely required that the frequency of examination needs to be updated. Actually, in Hong Kong, the examinations in this field is at least twice a year, compared to mainland, there is only one time in a year.

So when the frequency updates, whether the industrial information system can be used as convenient as now.

The aftermath is that the system is required to be designed as much as flexible, no matter how many times the examinations will be held.

? About the credit system. When the society gets the appraisers and agents? information through the website, whether the work experience should be printed on the page, and if there is a big mistake happened to the employee, how much that the society could find out.

Sure it won?t help the employee, but the society couldn?t totally understand the credit only from an easily level.

There are only some points that CIREA may consider about.

And at the same, surely, that the society is thankful for the great effort that CIREA makes. The standard of the real estate industrial information system also makes a good example for other fields. The mix of the management and administration is easy for everyone.
