2009 Urban Remote Sensing Joint Event

Abstract?This research paper aims at extracting features,  especially the plane feature, of building from Light Detection  And Ranging (LiDAR) point clouds in Urban Area, and with  these features and information to build the model of object.

Unlike modeling object in other fields, such as reverse  engineering, surfaces of building usually consist of abundant big  and plane surfaces which are significant features. In urban area,  most buildings can be simplified to the models that are made up  of approximate plane surfaces to which features of buildings  refer, in this paper. Among these surfaces, there are distinct  points and intersection lines (the edges and vertices of the  building object). Plane detection, surface adjacency relations  restoration, model parameter calculation, and model  reconstruction constitute the main research of extracting  geometric features and modeling the object. In this contribution,  some examples of deriving information from the point clouds  are presented to demonstrate the method. And, the results  prove that when the geometric information of vertices, edges  and normal lines of the plane surface, together with the  topological relations (Surface adjacency relations) among them,  is derived from the point cloud data, the model, representing  building in this paper, can be built effectively. Equally  significant, models generated from this method, while occupying  less memory space, can store more comprehensive structural  information, and have a better exhibitive effect. And this  method can provide three dimensional data of buildings from  point cloud data in applications like GIS, navigation and virtual  city.



I.  INTRODUCTION  In recent years, the automation and computer-assisted technology of 3D surface modeling, which is based on the surface point clouds of 3D entity, has gradually become the foundation of virtual reality, decision analysis and computer- assisted design. And the sources of point clouds show the trend of diversification, such as Space-borne and ground-based LiDAR data. In the realms of surveying, urban planning, and urban 3D landscape modeling, the objects of modeling are normally buildings which consist of plentiful plane surfaces in most cases. Therefore, utilizing the information extracted from the corresponding point clouds, the research of deriving building features, especially plane features, has practical needs.

The main characteristics of these modeling targets are: 1.The object, such as the complex polyhedrons, has many  regularly plane surfaces or approximate plane surfaces. 2. The object might only have a small quantity of curved surfaces. 3.

The angle between normal lines of two adjacent surfaces is always an approximate right angle. The characteristics determine that it is necessary to model buildings in a new method, which is different from methods in reverse engineering [1] and other fields [2]. At the same time, extraction of geometric information of plane surfaces, such as vertices, edges and normal lines and acquisition of the topological relationships among those are the most critical parts.

To achieve the goal mentioned above, several processes should be done: 1. Error elimination of point clouds [3]. 2.

Triangle mesh model generation [4]. In the focus of the research, extracting basic geometric information of a plane surface is based on the triangle mesh model of 3D object. Besides, topological information transmission and spatial index methods are used to solve the problem of the shortage of the geometric and topological information.

Then after the three main processes, plane detection, surface adjacency relations restoration, and model parameter calculation and model reconstruction, the 3D object can be expressed by both simple and abstract geometric features.



II. MAIN PARTS IN THE RESEARCH OF DERIVING FEATURES FROM THE POINT CLOUDS OF BUILDING IN  URBAN AREA  A. Plane detection  The process of Plane detection is based the triangle mesh of the building?s surface, as well as the normal and the topologic relationship of the triangles. In this paper, the method used to achieve this aim is growth triangle classification?starting with an initial growth triangle, based on the share relationship of edge among triangles. This approach classifies the triangles, whose differences of normal lines are small, in a continuous region, into one class.

The ?class? here means a surface. As to the building, the surface is represented by a mathematical plane. With the vertices coordinates of the triangles, which belong to the same class, the equation of each surface could be calculated. Due to    2009 Urban Remote Sensing Joint Event    the data loss at the vertices and edges of the building in the sampling process of point clouds, some originally non-existed surfaces would appear in the model; therefore, these falsely added surfaces should be eliminated from the final result.

B. Recursive algorithm of Plane detection  All the triangles, through recursive algorithm, are classified into several classes, according to the normal lines and the relation of the adjacent triangles.

The main processes of the growth triangle classification are as follows:  ? Step 1: Input one triangle as the initial growth triangle (from the triangle mesh of the object), and add its adjacent triangles into the growth candidate array.

? Step 2: Traverse the adjacent triangles of the initial growth triangle, and if the difference of the normal lines between the initial growth triangle and its adjacent triangle is less than the threshold provisions, the adjacent triangle is classified as the same class of the previous one. And its adjacent triangles are also added to the growth candidate array.

? Step 3:  Calculate the average normal and the total area of the current class.

? Step 4: Traverse all the triangles in the growth candidate array, and use the triangle as input of step 1.

The process from 1 to 3 will repeat until no triangle meets the condition of step 2.

? Step 5: Traverse all the unclassified triangles, and use one of these triangles as input of step 1. The process from step 1 to 3 will repeat until all the triangles are classified  In this process, recursive algorithm can accelerate the growth triangle classification. The main substance of recursive algorithm is expressed in Figure 1. At the end of every recursive process, a new class of surface is detected.

And Figure 2 shows the result of recursive algorithm of growth triangle classification. Different yellow levels in Figure 2 represent different surfaces (one surface here is tantamount to one class in the triangle classification) of the object.

C. Surface adjacency relations restoration  Due to the unorganized discrete sampling of point cloud data, the major surfaces extracted in the Plane detection lack the adjacency relations. But these relations are significant and basic information to obtain the geometric features and build the model of the object.

Two methods are employed in this paper to help restore the  surface adjacency relations. The first method is based on a 3D  spatial index. Like Figure 3 shows that, the space, containing  the point clouds, is first subdivided into small commensurate cubes, whose sizes are determined by sampling density. Under  this circumstance, every surface of the building penetrates a set  of cubes, therefore the spatial range of each surface, known as  its buffer could be expressed by the very set of cubes. Finally,  the adjacency relations of the surfaces could be obtained through comparison among buffers, if two buffers include  same cubes, the two surfaces is contiguous; else they are not.

(The adjacency relations cannot be directly taken out from the  adjacency relations of the triangles, because data might get lost  in the sampling process of point clouds at the vertices and  edges of the building.) In Figure 3, the adjacency relations of  the three 3D surfaces (not plane) can be built by the spatial  index.

Figure 1.  Recursive algorithm of Growth Triangle Classification    Figure 2.  Result of  Plane detection,different  color represent different surface (a. a part of a building surface; b. a cylinder object)  The second method is based on the transferring of surface  adjacency relations. Because there are many small surfaces  (considered as noise) between the major surfaces, the  adjacency relations of major surfaces are lost, which actually    2009 Urban Remote Sensing Joint Event    exist between the real surfaces. So this method employs these  small surfaces to transfer the adjacency relations between the major surfaces. Just like Figure 4 shows that, surface 4, 5, 6 are  noise surfaces, and the adjacency relations between major  surfaces 1, 2, 3 are lost. As an example of this method, the  noise surface 4 is the adjacency surface of major surface 1 and  2. So the surface 4 will transfer this contiguous relation to the  major surface 1 and 2. In this way, the surface adjacency  relations among the major surfaces can be restored.

Figure 3. 3D spatial index    Figure 4. Surface adjacency relations restoration    D. Model Parameter Calculation and Model Reconstruction  The contiguous relations of the object?s surfaces could reveal that the two surfaces which share a common edge and the three or more surfaces which share a same vertex. Then the coordinates of all vertices, together with the equations of all edges, could be calculated based on the equations of the surfaces [6]. Furthermore, the contiguous relations of plane surfaces help to determine the two vertices which are the terminal points of a certain edge, and the edges which surround a certain surface [7][8]. At this point, the whole building model is built from the point cloud. The geometric features, including  vertices, edges and normal lines of plane surfaces, are already extracted from the point clouds data. And the topological relationships among the geometric features are also obtained.

The results are expressed in next Section: Examples.



III. EXAMPLES  In this section, a practical example is presented to prove the method demonstrated above of deriving Features and building modeling from LIDAR point clouds in Urban Area. The vertices, edges and normal lines of the plane surface, and the topology relationships among them are extracted from the point cloud data of a building in urban area.

The building point cloud data are taken from a ground- based LiDAR scanner. Due to certain substances, such as trees which are near the building and some small parts of the building that could obstruct other parts, the data is not complete.

Figure 5. An example of building point cloud data and the extracted plane features  The data has 36972 points. And after triangle mesh construction there are 73113 triangles that made up of the surface.

Figure 5 shows the features derived and the original point clouds. From Figure 5, the result of modeling building and derived features prove the feasibility of the method demonstrated in the section 2. There are totally ten planes extracted from the point cloud data to make up the building model.

In Figure 6, the ten plane surfaces are shown in the picture along. In this picture, the main structure expressed by simple planes demonstrates that the method fits this type of building point cloud data well. And using this method to model the building only records a small amount of parameters.

IV. CONCLUSIONS  In this article, the main work is deriving features, especially  the plane feature that is one of the most significant features of  a building, and using the extracted features to model the object.

Plane detection, surface adjacency relations restoration, and  model parameter calculation and model reconstruction  constitute the main content of extracting features of the  building and modeling building. And the result of the example  proves the feasibility of these algorithms. Finally, four conclusions can be summarized as follows:   ?

? This method can provide three dimensional data of buildings form point cloud data to applications like GIS, navigation and virtual city.

? This method only uses the geometric information of plane feature (vertices, edges and normal) and the topological information among them to model the object, while occupying less memory space and it can store more comprehensive structural information.

? To the object, that has a great quantity of complex, small, curved surfaces, this method cannot effectively and completely extract the geometric features and topological information.

? The quality of triangle mesh of the surface has impacts on the final result, for plane detection and plane topology reconstruction are all based on the triangle mesh gained.
