I.  INTRODUCTION With the continuous development of information  technology, it is beginning to be applied in managing data storage business in more and more fields.

However, in face of an increasing number of data, there is a good database management system still needs further exploration. Data mining not only be able to make efficient data storage, and can extract hide useful knowledge.

The current Internet technology and its growing demand necessitates the development of more advanced data mining technologies to interpret the information and knowledge from the data distributed all over the world. In the 21st century this demand continues to grow. Data mining can discover interesting patterns or relationships describing the data and predictive or classify the behavior of the model based on available data. In other words, it is an interdisciplinary field with a general goal of predicting outcomes and uncovering relationships in data. It uses automated tools that employ sophisticated algorithms to discover mainly hidden patterns, associations, anomalies, and/or structure from large amounts of data stored in data warehouses or other information repositories and filter necessary information from this big dataset.

Association rule mining refers to discovering association relationships among different attributes.

Data mining in the telecommunications sales can.

analyze the optimal and rational sales to match. The association rule mining commodities can be found in the relationship between commodities, such as  commodities which are often together at the same time to buy.

Telecommunications industry is a typical data- intensive industry, with the deepening of telecom reform, competition is also becoming fierce increasingly. Compared with other industries, the telecommunications industry have more user's data., which can help people analyze the data accurately and obtain useful knowledge, in order to win the competition , people should find more business opportunities and provide users with better service. As a result, data warehouse and data mining has important value in the telecommunications industry.



II. CONCEPTION OF ASSOCIATION RULE AND THE CURRENT RELATED WORKS  Rule mining constitutes a major function of data mining. Consider a database of telecom customer transactions T, where each transaction is a set of items.

The objective is to find all rules of the form A => B, which correlate the presence of one set of items A with another set of items B. An example of such a rule is 80% of high users use the value-added services such as SMS, CRBT ? color ring back tone? , access the Internet by mobile phone and so on at the same time.

For this purpose, one needs to ensure that support of A and B are greater than a user threshold s, and conditional probability (confidence) of B given A is greater than a user threshold c. A rule must have some minimum user-specified Confidence. A rule 1 &2=? 3 is defined to have 90% confidence if when a customer choose service 1 and 2, in 90% of those cases, the customer also choose service 3. A rule must also have some minimum user-specified Support. This implies that the rule 1 & 2 => 3 should hold in some minimum percentage of transactions, in order to have business value. There can be any number of services in the consequent and antecedent parts of a rule. It is also possible to specify constraints on rules.

An association rule can generally be viewed as being defined over attributes of a relation and has the form A => B. Suppose I = (i1, i2, i3... im) is item sets. Set up task-related data D is a collection of database, in  DOI 10.1109/SNPD.2009.38    DOI 10.1109/SNPD.2009.38     which each of the items T is a collection and T ? I.

Suppose A is a item set , T includes A only if A is a subset of T, then A => B, of which A , B is a subset of the I and A ? B = ?, the rules of A => B-D in the affairs of support with which s is the s in D Services include the percentage of A ? B,  The confidence level in Rules A => B of D item set is c, Rules A => B-D in the affairs with a confidence level c: this is the conditional probability P (B | A), namely Support (A=>B)= P(A ? B); confidence(A=>B)=P(B|A)  .Association rule mining is an expression of the form A => B, where A and B are subsets of all attributes, and the implication holds with a confidence > c, where c is a user-defined threshold. This implies IF A THEN B, with at least c confidence.

In other words, given huge volumes of heterogeneous data, the objective is to efficiently extract meaningful patterns that can be of interest and hence useful to the user. The role of interestingness is to threshold or filters the large number of discovered patterns, and reports only those which may be of some use. There are two approaches to designing a measure of interestingness of a pattern, namely, objective and subjective. The former uses the structure of the pattern and is generally quantitative. Often it fails to capture all the complexities of the pattern discovery process. The subjective approach, on the other hand, depends additionally on the user-who examines the pattern.

Association rules initially were developed in the context of market-basket analysis, they have proved useful in a wide range of applications. However, association rules are not directly applicable to numeric data. The standard approach to incorporating numeric data is discrimination, a process by which the values of a numeric fields in a database are divided into sub ranges. Each such sub range is treated as an item in the association rule analysis. Each record in the database is treated as containing the item corresponding to the sub range within which the numeric value for the record falls.

Applications of association rule analysis are not restricted to such analyses of purchasing behavior, however. The manner in which association rule approaches identify all rules that satisfy some set of measures of interestingness make them useful for a wide variety of applications in which the user seeks insight into a set of data. The user can specify the quantifiable measures of what makes a rule interesting.

Further factors may apply that are difficult to quantify, but the user can apply these manually to select the most useful of the rules discovered by the automated system.

Another application of association rules has been for classification. Rather than the classical approach of learning classification rules, a large set of high- confidence association rules are discovered. To classify a new object, all rules that cover the object are  identified, and then the relative support and confidence of each rule is used to identify the most probable class for the object  Early approaches to association rule discovery sought all rules that satisfy constraints on support and confidence. More recent techniques utilize additional measures of how interesting a rule is, including lift and leverage.

the current related works about the research of this topic is still less. The innovation of this paper lies in the association rules algorithm is applied to mobile value- added services. The conclusion of the research is valuable for Telecom operators in China to develop the value-added services.



III. APRIORITY ALGORITHM IN VALUE-ADDED SERVICE  First, confirm that you have the correct template for your This algorithm computes frequent item sets from a transactions database over multiple iterations. Each iteration involves Candidate generation and Candidate counting and selection. Utilizing the knowledge about infrequent item sets, obtained from previous iterations, the algorithm prunes a priori those candidate item sets that cannot become frequent. After discarding every candidate item set that has an infrequent subset, the algorithm enters the candidate counting step. Value- added service in Mobile Telecom includes SMS?surf on-line, CRBT, MMS, Java, IVR and so on. In the following tables, Apriority algorithm is applied to discover association relationships among different value-added services in Mobile Telecom in China.

Table ? depicts the value-added service items in four transactions. For a minimum support of 50% and a minimum confidence of 50%, we have the following rules  (1) SMS =? CRBT with 50% support and 66% confidence;  (2) CRBT =>SMS with 50% support and 100% confidence.

TABLE I.  APPLICATION IN TELECOM OF ASSOCIATION RULE MINING  Transaction ID value-added service items   ?SMS?surf on-line ,CRBT? ?SMS?CRBT? ?SMS?MMS? ?surf on-line?Java, IVR?   The objective is to generate confident rules, having  at least the minimum confidence. The problem decomposition proceeds as follows:     ? Find all sets of items that have minimum support, typically using the Apriority  algorithm . This is the most expensive phase of the search, and involves lots of research for reducing the complexity.

? Use the frequent item sets to generate the desired rules. Given m items there can be potentially 2m frequent item sets.

Consider Table ?. For the rule SMS =? CRBT , we have  Support = Support ({SMS, CRBT }) = 50% And  Confidence =  { }( ) { }( )SMSport CRBTSMSport  sup ,sup  = 66%.

TABLE II.  COMPUTATION OF FREQUENT ITEM SETS   Frequent item set Support (%)  ?SMS? ?surf on-line? ?CRBT? ?SMS? CRBT?    The Apriori algorithm is outlined as follows. Let FK  be the set of frequent itemsets of size k, let Ck be the set of candidate itemsets of size k, and let F1 be the set of large items. We start from k = 1.

(1) for all items in frequent item set FK repeat steps 2-4.

(2)Generate new candidates Ck+1 from FK.

(3)for each transaction T in the database, increment  the count of all candidates in CK+1 that are contained in T.

(4)Generate frequent item sets Fk+1of size k from candidates in CK+1 with minimum support.

A key observation is that every subset of a frequent item set is also frequent. This implies that a candidate item set in CK+1 can be pruned if even one of its subsets is not contained in FK.

TABLE III.  TRANSACTIONS DATABASE FOR FREQUENT ITEM SET GENERATION  Transaction ID value-added service items   ?SMS?CRBT, MMS? ?surf on-line, CRBT, Java? ?SMS?surf on-line, CRBT, Java? ?surf on-line?Java?   Table ? (see the  next  page)  A priori algorithm is explained with an example database of transactions provided in Table ?. Consider Table ?, with a minimum Support > 50%. After the first scan of the database, we have the candidate item sets C1 along with their corresponding Supports, as : ?SMS?50%, { surf on-line } : 75%, { CRBT } : 75%, { MMS } : 25%, and { Java } : 75%.The frequent item sets FI consist of { surf on-line }, { CRBT }, and { Java }, each with Support of 75%.Now the candidate item sets C2 are ?surf on-line, CRBT?, ?surf on-line, Java?, ?CRBT, Java? , with Supports of 50%, 75%, 50%, respectively. The corresponding frequent item set F2 becomes?surf on-line, Java?with a Support of 75%.The rules generated are   CRBT=?Java with Confidence  = { }( )  { }( )Surfonlineport JavaSurfonlineport  sup ,sup  =100%      and Java=?CRBT with Confidence   =  { }( ) { }( )Javaport  JavaSurfonlineport sup  ,sup  =100%  However, in this method, multiple passes have to be  made over the database for each different value of minimum support and confidence. This number can be as large as the longest frequent item set. For very large databases of transactions, this may involve considerable input-output (I/O) and lead to unacceptable response times for online queries. Moreover, the potential number of frequent item sets is exponential to the number of different items, although the actual number of frequent item sets can be smaller.

From the table ? we can see that surf on-line and Java have high association relationships among different value-added services in Mobile Telecom in China. Therefore telecom enterprises can the bundling selling these two kinds of services and provide more favorable package service.



IV. CONCLUSION AND THE FUTURE WORKS Data mining is a good area of scientific study  holding ample promise for the research community Lots of progress has been reported for large  databases, specifically involving association rules, classification, clustering, similar time sequences, similar text document retrieval, similar image retrieval, outlier discovery, etc. Many papers have been published in major conferences and leading journals.

However, it still remains a promising and rich field with many challenging research issues.
