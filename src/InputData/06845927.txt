A Big Data Framework for u-Healthcare Systems Utilizing Vital Signs

Abstract? Healthcare systems are evolving from simple medical devices to ubiquitous healthcare systems working at anytime and anywhere. In particular, acquisition and transmission of vital signs from wearable devices with biosensors will be soon realized in our daily lives.

Interestingly, when vital signs such as Electrocardiogram (ECG), respiration and the motion data are collected and accumulated, they become a kind of big data, which will be eventually a crucial clue for monitoring health in everyday life and preventing from diseases. This paper proposes a big data framework for u-healthcare systems that provide healthcare services based upon the analysis of the big data of vital signs. The framework includes methods for provision of real-time services as well as for transmission and analysis of the data. It employs an open standard platform to secure interoperability among the data and different devices. The proposed framework was implemented and tested in terms of the motion data from accelerometers.

I.  INTRODUCTION A paradigm for healthcare practices gradually shifts  from cure to prevention [1]. With advances of communications and of biosensors with wearable devices, ubiquitous (u-) healthcare systems have great potentiality for prevention from and early detection of diseases utilizing vital signs acquired from wearable devices with biosensors such as Electrocardiogram (ECG), body temperature, and the like [2, 3]. They will also help predict and manage one?s health at anytime and anywhere.

At first, such u-healthcare systems have to enable acquisition of bio-signals from wearable medical devices.

They should then graft onto techniques for storing, processing and analysing vital signs. There are two kinds of vital signs [4]: one is the signals measured at a moment like body temperature and blood pressure, and the other is continuous signals, respiration and ECG. The former is suitable for storing the signals in the database, while the latter in files. In particular, continuous data need to be handled as big data in terms of type and volume of the data. Until now, big data analysis has been centred around  text mining including opinion mining and social network analysis [5, 6].

What is important is that while the text data are directly analysed using some techniques, the raw data of bio- signals should be first interpreted to an understandable level using algorithms. That implies that the bio-signal data need one more stage where the raw data is interpreted, followed by further analysis of the interpreted or extracted data. For this reason, the big data platform for processing vital signs is to be different from the one for text data.

While Hadoop is largely used as the platform for text data mining [7], it is not sufficiently powerful for vital signal mining that requires analysis of the vital signals and real- time provision of services.

Against this problem, we propose a framework on which u-healthcare systems utilizing vital signs can be built, extending the Hadoop platform. The proposed and implemented framework includes transmission of the bio- signal data, algorithms extracting features from them, standardized data expression, Map/Reduce that analyses the data in HDFS [8], and an open platform, SOA (Service Oriented Architecture [9, 10]) to provide services.

The contents of this paper are as follows: we describe big data and vital signs in section 2, and the proposed framework for u-healthcare systems in section 3. We also apply it to the motion data from accelerometers in section 4.



II. BIG DATA AND VITAL SIGNS As the background, this section accounts for the two  notions of big data and vital signs briefly, and then explains why vital signs are big data.

A. Big Data With rapid growth in usage of various social media and  smartphones, different kinds of big data in the form of text are generated, circulated and stored, requesting to mine such big data. Usage of many sensors acquiring the data including RFID has been also expanded, which enables context aware computing in more realistic ways. Further, the development of cloud environments that can collect various data streamlines the process of gathering and utilizing customers? personal data and their patterns of  2014 International Symposium on Computer, Consumer and Control  DOI 10.1109/IS3C.2014.135     purchasing. In the future, therefore, big data analysis will become a must in firms, institutes, and the society [11].

Big data can be defined as dataset which is the notion far beyond collection, management and analysis of the data in traditional database management tools. This is the reason why big data is characterized with 3V (Volume, Velocity, Variety) [4, 5]. With no doubt, vital signals satisfy such characteristics.

B. Vital Signs There are various bio-sensors measuring ECG,  respiration, SpO2, blood pressure, temperature, and even acceleration. Interestingly, there are two kinds of vital signs in relation to how to collect the data. The first type includes temperature and blood pressure, which are collected at a certain moment. This type of vital sign data is regarded as structured data which can be easily stored in the database. The second type is the data that should be acquired with continuous time series, e.g. ECG, respiration, and SpO2. Such data is unstructured, which is not adequate to be stored in the database, but in files. The second type is interesting for big data analysis and the primary concern in this paper.

Figure 1.  Two types of vital signs: Blood pressure (collected at a moment, left), ECG (collected with continuous time series, right)  C. Vital Signs as Big Data Vital signs themselves acquired with continuous time  series (e.g. ECG, respiration) are not an index to understand one?s health, but should be processed to produce more meaningful indexes by algorithmic techniques. To handle such unstructured vital signs, therefore, the whole framework should contain feature extraction algorithms. Extracted feature values can then be recorded in the database. However, a problem arises that data interoperability is not secured, since different databases have different characteristics, and one must know the database schema. For this reason, the framework that we propose was built to enable representation of the vital sings data as a standardized format HL7 (Health Level Seven, [12]). For example, it helps to express various bio-signal data such as respiration and acceleration, extending HL7 aECG (annotated ECG) standard [13].

Bio-signals with time series are big enough and unstructured. For example, when the system gathers ECG signals from one person at 240 Hz (240 data per second), it collects 864,000 data per hour. If it gathers such data from 10,000 persons, the amount of the data becomes soon huge.



III. BIG DATA PLATFORM FOR ANALYSIS OF VITAL SIGNS  Recently, big data technology has largely taken Hadoop, an open software from Apache. Hadoop enables storage of big data in a distributed environment and parallel processing many server clusters. Hadoop Distributed File System (HDSF) distributes and stores  files, separating name nodes from data nodes, so that it can serve as fast storage. Map/Reduce is a subproject and a programming model. It is simple but basically parallel and has the processing mechanism in Fig 2.

In particular, Hadoop has inadequate aspects for handling unstructured bio-signals. This is because it does not have any solution by itself to the problems like how to collect the signals, weather it contains algorithms to extract features from the raw signal data, and if it provides the user with services real-time.

Resolving these problems, the platform that we suggest adds algorithms extracting feature values from the raw data of vital signs, a feature storage model and a SOA for real-time services (See Fig 3).

Figure 2.  Three characteristics of big data   Figure 3.  Extended big data platform for vital signs analysis  In this extended platform, vital sign data and the analytic results of them are transmitted with a W3C open standard SOAP messages. The values of features extracted from e.g. accelerometer data such as the moving distance, the number of steps and the amount of calorie consumption are represented and stored by HL7-based meta model.



IV. IMPLEMENTATION This section describes the implementation of the  proposed framework for u-healthcare systems utilizing vital signs collected with continuous time series.

Acceleration data are employed to explain the framework.

A primary reason for taking them in the study is that these data can be more easily obtained than other data, since accelerometers are embedded in nearly every smartphone.

A. Transmission of Vital Signs When acceleration data from smartphones are  transmitted to the server, the framework supports interoperability among different devices, sending the data     by a W3C RPC (Remote Procedure Call) model, SOAP messages.

B. Feature Extraction Algorithms Acceleration data consist of x, y, z, three axis values.

The system can detect one?s motions and steps using these values. Many algorithms are already introduced and well- known. In this study, we implemented algorithms to detect the number of steps, the moving distance, the amount of calorie consumed, etc. The algorithms extract such feature values from the raw acceleration data, and send them to HL7-based feature value transformation module (See Fig 3).

C. Storage Model for Vital Signs For the sake of interoperability, the values extracted  from the raw data by algorithms are represented on an extended HL7 standard aECG format that can contain semantic information. The raw data is separately stored in HDFS that Hadoop provides. The HL7 aECG model with an XML form originally includes the raw data. However, since its amount is huge, its inclusion into the XML document is not wise in terms of performance and inappropriate as big data structure. This is because the raw data is too inadequate to approach it semantically in big data. Therefore, the framework makes it be stored in an independent space.

D. Analysis Model Generally, text files are mainly used in Hadoop with  some text mining techniques. On the other hand, HL7- based XML documents are employed in our work, which implies that the system needs XML parsing. Hadoop basically provides a project enabling programming for text mining, called Map/Reduce, which plays a role to make the data key-value pairs. The framework that we propose supports expression by key-value pairs. Map is used to extract feature values such as the number of steps, distance and the amount of calorie consumption. The framework was also designed to calculate the values required for various services using key-value pairs that Map provides.

Figure 4 illustrates this process.

Figure 4.  Flow of vital signs analysis using Map-Reduce  E. Service Model The resulting values provided by Map/Reduce are  transformed to SOAP messages through SOA, and are transmitted to the client program or to the terminal. Here, SOA is an open standard platform using W3C standard SOAP messages to call and parse objects between heterogeneous devices, independent of kinds of terminals and of OS. When SOAP messages are parsed, the client program gets a service in which the analysis results are received. The values obtained from the acceleration data are the amount of calorie consumption, a moved distance, the number of steps, and the time for exercise.



V.  CONCLUSIONS Our time is an age of data. Techniques for storing,  representing and mining the vast amount of data that increase exponentially became important. This paper serves as a pioneering research work on a software framework on a special type of big data of vital signs.

Physiological signals are crucial markers to judge one?s health. However, a problem of current existing technology storing and analyzing vital signs arises due to its dependency on sensors and vendors, since products of each vendor have their own distinct characteristics. This means lack of standardization and interoperability in relation to u- healthcare systems and a difficulty of system integration.

Further, storage design for vital signs has been very poorly conducted, which eventually causes performance degradation and unreliability of the systems.

Against these problems, we have proposed a big data framework in this paper. The framework takes the basic Hadoop structure and extends it to make it suitable for handling physiological signals, by designing the method of transmitting vital sign data to the server, of extracting feature values, and extending the data representation model and the real-time service model. It also provides standardized services to secure interoperability. We finally believe that the proposed framework aids the performance and the reliability of a given u-healthcare system. Further, by combining it with big data mining techniques, the framework can lay a foundation to provide high quality healthcare services including exercise management, chronic disease management and disease prevention, utilizing vital signs captured at every moment.
