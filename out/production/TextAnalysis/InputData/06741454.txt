Self M2M based Wearable Watch Platform for  Collecting Personal Activity in Real-time

Abstract? Tracking and monitoring the history of personal activities by using wearable device can be applied in various different ways. For example, by analyzing the personal activities can be used to diagnose the symptoms of certain illness such as Parkinson?s disease. The activity data can also tell the severity of the user?s chronic illness. In this paper, we propose the watch platform which keeps the record of the user?s activity data. This activity history is collected automatically inside the user?s watch through peer-to-peer direct communicating with other devices. In order to implement self-awareness and the opportunistic computing manner in the watch platform, some advanced concepts such as ultra-low power consumption schemes and peer- to-peer direct communication between watch and external devices are included. On the proposed platform, we have implemented a prototype watch as a test bed for our software platform and also measured the several performance including power consumption rate and the computing opportunity of the prototype.

I. INTRODUCTION Wearable devices can analyze the user?s personal activity  for prolonged time, and this activity or informative patterns can be applied in various ways. For example, when the user who has turned on the gas oven leaves the house, the watch automatically detects the situation and alerts the warning message to the user in real-time. Also by analyzing the activity pattern of a person who is suffering from Parkinson?s disease, can diagnose the symptom and severity of the illness. Wearable device is appropriate for collecting and analyzing the user?s activity which can be reformed into more useful information.

Most of the recent watch-type devices are focused on SMS service, remote control of the smartphone and analyzing movements using internal accelerometer. Current watch platforms do not support the functions for assessing and analyzing personal activities in terms of software and hardware structure. That is because, the existing watches require paring step to communicate with external devices. There are many difficulties in terms of speed and user interaction.

In order to collect personal activity data and analyze them, the watch needs to have specific functions. These functions are understanding the user?s condition, predicting the behavior, and ID-exchanging between the devices through the direct communication. In addition, the low-power schemes are essential to ensure long operating time because a wearable device has a limited battery capacity. At last, because user?s consistent intervention for operating the watch is inconvenient in user?s perspective, making the implicit HCI(Human- Computer Interaction) is an important factor.

In this paper, we propose architecture of the watch-type wearable devices for assessment and analysis of the user?s activity for diverse services. This platform includes many functions to implement features mentioned above. In addition, it is based on opportunistic computing[1] to increase user convenience and realize low-power system. The watch will be able to provide useful services to elderly or people with disability as well as general users.

Regarding the organization of this paper, section 2 explains related works about wearable devices and section 3 represents the purpose of the platform through service scenario using the platform. Section 4 shows the proposed architecture and core functions. Section 5 and 6 explains the usefulness of the platform through implementing the service scenario and energy efficiency. In the last section, we summarize the platform and explain future works.



II. REALATED WORKS Various types of wearable devices such as glasses, shoes  and watch have been developed and sold. Among these devices, especially a wide variety of watch-type wearable devices are being sold by different manufacturers. The most representative products are Pebble Watch[2] and Smart Watch[3] by SONY.

Especially Pebble is a watch developed by social funding and it provides services such as SMS, music control and gesture recognition through communicating with smartphone or tablet.

Also because the watch provides SDK to developer, it can be used to develop different kind of services.

Other than the wearable device that focus on interacting with a smart device, a variety of platform are developed to  This work was supported by the IT R&D program of MSIP/KEIT.

recognize behavior and give alarm. Unlike the existing devices that recognize user?s behavior by accelerometers, eWatch[4] is a platform inferring the user?s location  by using microphone and light sensor. In addition, there are devices for detecting the falls[5] and sending patient or elderly?s conditions to external device[6].



III. PROPOSED SERVICE SCENARIO AND DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS  a.

Fig. 1. Self M2M based watch service scenario as a personal activity black box.

Fig.1 is a service scenario that shows the process of collecting user?s various activities using the watch and sending the activities to a smartphone. Detailed procedure is as following. A user wearing the watch presses the digital door lock button to enter the house. After pressing the door lock button, door lock wakes the watch which is in the sleep mode and checks the user?s ID. If the ID is the registered user, door lock opens the door and sends the arrival activity to the watch.

After the user passes the front door, the watch wakes up periodically and exposes its presence by sending its ID to a stationary node. Through this process, the watch in the living room receives its location information from stationary node and saves them. After this step, user measures his/her weight and the watch receives the activity from the body scale.

Medication alert message which is sent by smart pill reminder is shown on the watch?s display. The user reads this message and moves to the bed room from living room in order to take the medicine. At this time, changed location data is sent to user?s watch from stationary node and saved in the watch.

After the user who moves to the smart pill reminder presses the button, the pill reminder discharges the medicine and sends the medication completion message after confirming the user?s ID.

The user who completed taking a medication moves to the front door and opens it to go out and then watch receives activity data similar to as in the case of return. Finally, the user can send off all activity data kept inside the watch to a smartphone in order to see or share the data.

In above service scenario, any command or setting had not been applied to the watch by user in order to activate the process of activity accumulation. The user can collect the  activity data just by wearing a watch and associating his/her daily life. This is possible because of the watch?s tasks which can communicate with peripherals (ex - door lock, body scale and pill reminder) and can recognize the user?s location that are performed autonomously depending on the situation. The watch platform includes the operating structure and functions that autonomously performs the periodic and non-periodic tasks according to the user?s current situation.

The followings are design considerations to implement the watch platform.

? Direct communications between the devices and opportunistic computing architecture.

? Priority-based preemptive multi-tasking.

? Location-aware and asynchronous message delivery protocols.

? Low-power schemes for wearable device.



IV. THE PROPSED WATCH PLATFORM ARCHITECTURE The following is the software architecture for the proposed  watch platform.

b.

Fig. 2. Watch platform?s software architecture.

The proposed software platform in this paper includes essential functions such as direct communication between devices that can accumulate the user?s activity data and connect with the smartphone. Also the platform concentrates on minimizing the user?s interventions. This will help users who have less knowledge about IT devices to easily control the watch. Fig. 2 shows the watch platform?s software architecture which contains these features.

The proposed watch platform is divided into three main layer. The lowest level, OS layer, is composed of RTOS kernel and BSP(Board Support Package). The middle level, system layer, provides the core and managing functions. The highest level, applications layer, is layer that provides a services directly to the user.

A. OS Layer - Ubinos as a resource constrained RTOS In the watch platform, multiple functions such as  communicating with external devices, alerting the user with important information and sensing the movement with accelerometer gyro sensors are performed at the concurrent time. In this environment where multiple tasks are performed concurrently, firmware level software or event-driven OS are not suitable to control the system. Therefore, RTOS which supports a variety of real-time functions by multitasking should be used to guarantee reliable system operation. We use RTOS that is developed in our lab called UBINOS in order to meet these conditions. Ubinos supports priority-based preemptive multitasking and rich inter-task communications [7]. Because of these reasons, Ubinos is suitable for wearable devices.

B. System Manager Layer System manager handles the overall resource of the watch  platform and system control. There are four main managers in the watch platform. Each managers are described below.

? UI Manager - In this watch platform, user can control the system by using two buttons. UI manager displays the different types of application that you can select and allows the selection of application.

? BLE Manager - Bluetooth low energy module is used to communicate with external devices. BLE manager controls this BLE status and communication functions.

? Module Manager - Watch platform allows connection with other sensor modules through the external port.

Module manager distinguishes the type of the module and according to the module selects the pre-defined protocol which is used to send and receive the data.

? Power Manager - In wearable devices, power management is a very important function because the wearable system has a limited battery capacity.

Because of this, the watch platform provides low- power schemes to increase the energy efficiency. The schemes decreases the power consumption by operating the system as a low-power mode when the idle task is being performed.

C. M2M Manager Layer 1) PNIP(Proximity based Neighbor Identification  Protocol) In the proposed service scenario of the section 3, there are  an ID authentication process to enter the house and also data transferring process when measuring user?s weight and sending the data to the watch. If you implement these process by using RF module alone, RF module should be always turned on or needs to be turned on by a user whenever the function is required. The former case will increase the system?s power consumption and the latter case may cause inconvenience and hassle of operation. To solve this problems, watch platform has a protocol called PNIP. The PNIP is a communication protocol to wake the adjacent devices and exchange their ID when the data transmission is needed.

The most important part for implementing the PNIP is how to wake the system in sleep mode wirelessly. To implement this, we use LF(Low Frequency) module as well as the BLE module. The LF module generates interrupt signal by detecting the predefined pattern signal. By using this LF module and transceiver which generates the signal, system wakes up and starts to exchange the data. If you use this protocol, you can reduce the power consumption and user intervention. Fig. 3 shows the sequence diagram of the PNIP.

c.

Fig. 3. Sequence diagram of the PNIP  2) LIDx & AMD(Location-Aware and Asychronous Message Delivery Protocol)  LIDx is an indoor location-aware protocol[8]. In this protocol, stationary node is placed in every unit space(ex- bedroom, living room, kitchen) and it estimates the location of the watch by comparing the strength of the RF signal. Each stationary node is connected to physical network and they make an overlay network. Through this overlay network, stationary nodes share location of the watch and if this location changes, it sends the location info to the watch from a stationary node. AMD is a protocol that signifies the way to send an asynchronous message among the devices which are in the same network[8]. This protocol is used for sending a medication alert message to user in proposed service scenario.

In this platform, we use this location-aware and message delivery protocol to precisely identify the user?s lifestyle and activity.

D. Application Layer Application layer consists of services that are provided by  watch platform. Four main services are provided by a platform and a variety of services will be added to a platform by expansion of the service scenario. Each service consists of one or more tasks and they are developed to work independently to the system. The following explains the four basic applications which are provided by the watch platform.

? Activity App - Activity app accumulates the user?s activity data and sends the data to external devices or smart devices when the transfer is requested. The activities include user?s health data such as weight, blood glucose and pressure as well as indoor location information and outdoor exercise info.

? Scheduler App - This application receives the user?s schedule info from smart devices and shows an alarm message according to schedule time.

? External App - Watch platform can communicate with various external sensor module through the external port by wire. External app receives and saves the data which are sent by the sensor module through the module manager.

? Physical Activity Recognition (PAR) App - This application is used to recognize the user?s gestures or movements. This app can work as a motion controller for the watch?s certain function or external devices through communication.



V. APPLICATION OF ACTIVITY HISTORY The following describes the diverse usage of activity data  that is collected through communicating with external devices.

Activity accumulating service is useful for patients who have a chronic disease such as diabetes, hypertension and obesity. This service allows the users to see their trend of health info and life pattern. This history information can be used as a stepping stone to improve the symptoms. We implement the service scenario which is proposed in section 3 and then fig. 4 shows the results. Fig. 4(a) displays actual activities which are accumulated by watch. Fig. 4(b) shows health data such as weight, blood glucose and blood pressure.

d.

Activity reminding service indicates a specific action to user and give an alert message according to the schedule. To send a medication alert message in proposed service scenario is a representative example. Fig. 5 shows the detailed process of medication alert service.

In medication reminding scenario, pill reminder send a medication alert message to stationary node by AMD.

Stationary node searches a receiving device which is in network and send the message to that device. The medication alert message is displayed on the watch?s display after it receives the message. After the user receives the message, invalid user tries to take a medication. But the pill reminder does not discharge medicine because reminder certifies her ID by PNIP. When the valid user tries to take the medicine it is  e.

Fig. 5. Representative example of the activity reminding(medication reminding xample of a figure caption)  discharged. Fig. 6 (a) shows the actual medication alert message which is sent by pill reminder. There is other reminding service which is alerted by using the activity that is collected by the watch. When the user tries to leave the house, the activity history is examined and if certain activity is missing such as turning off the gas stove after turning it on, the watch alarms the user. Figure (b) shows this alert message.

f.

Fig. 6. Reminding message (a) Medication reminding (b) Ignition reminding  Fig 7 shows the name exchanging service using human motions. This service is activated by human motion such as waving or shaking hands when two people meets. The identity data of the person is recorded and can be used to inform the user whom he/she met plus a doctor can use this identity history as a medical parameter to test the patient?s memory status by asking the user who he/she met.

VI. POWER PERFORMANCE EVALUATION Wearable devices have a short operating time due to limited  battery capacity, whereas a variety of functions are provided.

Because of that, power management is an essential function.

Because our platform provides low-power schemes, it is possible to increase energy efficiency.

Consumption of the current in various state of the watch (a) Idle (watch) (b) PNIP with resource device (c) Indoor locationing(LIDx) (d) Outdoor exercise  Fig. 8 shows the graph of the current consumption in various state of the watch. As you can see the consumption of the current is increased at arising of computing and is minimized during the rest period. Table 1 shows the current value at each states.

TABLE I. CURRENT VALUE IN EACH STATE  State Min(uA) Max(mA) Avg  No power Management  28.75mA 28.75 28.75mA  Idle(watch) 110.62 2.38 114.23uA  PNIP 114.33 28.12 1.25mA  LIDx 109.78 26.51 242.72uA  Sencing 403.50 13.83 1.04mA  As seen in table 1, average current value of the no power management state is 28.75mA. By comparing this data with other state?s average value, we can see that current consumption is saved more than 95%(idle) up to 99%(PNIP).



VII. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS In this paper, we have proposed software and hardware  architecture of the watch-type wearable device to keep track and analyze the user?s activity of various actions. Also many kinds of reminding services based on the record of the personal activity are provided by this platform. To implement the activity-tracking services and low power consumption, the  platform requires various functions such as PINP and LIDx & AMD. The PNIP is a communication protocol to wake the adjacent devices and exchange their ID. LIDx&AMD is a location-awareness and asynchronous message delivery protocol. Not only the communication protocol, but also low power schemes are provided by the platform in order to increase energy efficiency.

We have proposed the service scenario that shows the process of self-collecting the user?s various activities and sending the activities to the smartphone. In addition, we implemented the activity-reminding services such as medication and fire alert. By using this scenario, a specific activity is guided for the user.

By measuring the consumption of the current in each state of the watch, we found out that the watch operates using minimal consumption of power.

Tracking and analyzing the user?s activities can be used for various services further than the application mentioned above.

If the analysis of the user?s precise behavior or motion info is available, then more accurate pattern of daily life can be brought about. Through that, more advanced services with similar functions can be provided to users.
