Abstract: A novel approach to construct fuzzy classification system based on fuzzy association rules is proposed in this paper. Competitive agglomeration algorithm is employed to partition quantitative attributes from each data record into several optimized fuzzy sets, resulting in an initial fuzzy classification system. A fuzzy classification system with high accuracy and interpretability can be further achieved by genetic strategies. Simulation applied to an existent diabetes dataset demonstrates the performance of the proposed approach is better than those of other popular classification methods.

Key Words: Inverted pendulum, fuzzy logic, genetic algorithm        given that no friction exists in the system between the cart and the rail or between the cart and the pendulum.

The dynamic equation of the inverted pendulum system [12] can be expressed as:  1 2x x=                 (1)     cos sin cossin  4 cos  p  c p  p  c p  m l ug m mx  ml m m  ? ? ? ? ?  ?  + ?  + =  ? +  (2)  where the parameters mc and mp are respectively the mass of the cart and the mass of the pendulum in the unit (kg), and 9.8 /g m s=  is the gravity acceleration. The parameter l is the half length of the pendulum in the unit (m). The variable u  means the control force in the unit (N) applied horizontally to the cart. The variables ?  and ?   represent the angle between pendulum and upright position and the angular velocity respectively.

2.3 Initial MFs Mining Fuzzy Association Rules To control the system, the state variable vector is chosen as  1x? = , 2x? =  and then specifically, we assume the universe of discourse for the two state variables to be  50 50?? ? ? ? ? and 10 10?? ? ?  from human knowledge.

First we construct seven membership functions for 1x on its universe, that is, for the values positive very big (PVB), positive big (PB), positive (P), zero (ZO), negative (N), negative big (NB), negative very big (NVB), as shown in Figure 3. Furthermore, we construct five membership functions for 2x  on its universe, that is, for the values positive big (PB), positive (P), zero (ZO), negative (N), negative big (NB) as shown in Figure 4. To partition the control space as output, we design nine membership functions for u  on its universe, which is 40 40u? ? ?  as shown in Figure 5. Note that the MFs can be changed and rules can be selected adaptively in this paper in order to obtain a good performance.

2.4 Initial MFs Mining Fuzzy Association Rules We use an algebraic product for all t-norm operators and max for all the s-norm operators.

3 GENETIC LATERAL TUNING OF MFS AND RULES SELECTION  For the tuning methods, the most well-known approaches are neural networks and genetic algorithms. Considering GAs, a chromosome with a large number of related genes is necessary to represent all the involved parameters, and this fact leads to a convergence problems of the evolutionary methods [13], [14].

3.1 Lateral Tuning of MFs  In [15], a new model of tuning of FRBSs is proposed, which only considers the linguistic 2-tuples representation scheme that is introduced in [11]. This model allows the lateral displacement of a label to maintain the interpretability. This new tuning approach is based on a simple data-driven learning method. The lateral displacement represented by a linguistic 2-tuple is named symbolic translation of a linguistic label. The symbolic translation of a label is a number within the interval ( 0.5, 0.5), which expresses the domain of a label when it is moving between its two adjacent lateral labels. Assume a set of labels S representing a fuzzy partition. Formally, to represent the symbolic translation of a label in S , we have the 2-tuple  ( , )i is ?      , ( 0.5,0.5)i is S ?? ? ?              (4)  For example, Figure 6 shows the symbolic translation of a label represented by the pair 2( , 0.3)s ?  together with the lateral displacement of the corresponding MF, where d indicates the lateral displacement and sets -0.3 as default value, and 2s?  shows the tuning MF for the original linguistic term 2s .

Fig 6. Lateral displacement of MF  3.2 Algorithms for Genetic Lateral Tuning of MFs and Rules Selection  Coding Scheme: A double coding scheme for both lateral tuning and rule selection is considered as follows:  D RC C C= +                                (5)  where RC  denotes gene encoding for the rule selection, DC represents gene encoding for lateral displacement as depicted in Figure 6. One chromosome in the proposed genetic algorithm comprises  RC  and DC  in series.

Initial Gene Pool: The initial pool is obtained with an individual having both genes in the DC part and in the RC part, and the individuals are generated randomly in [- 0.5, 0.5] and [0, 9] respectively.

Crossover: As for the DC part, one of the two environment-based crossover operators is employed, which combined with the standard two-point crossover operation for the RC  part. The two-point crossover involves exchanging the fragments of the parents contained between two points selected at random, resulting in two different offspring. In this case, four offspring are generated by combining the two from the part DC and the two from the part RC . The two best offspring obtained in this way are considered as the two corresponding descendants. The crossover operation can be taken sequentially as follows: 1. Let us assume 1{ }gX x x= and 1{ }gY y y= ,  ( , [ 0.5,0.5]i ix y ? ? ), are two real-coded chromosomes that are going to be crossed. A BLX-  crossover  and a hybrid between a BLX-  and an arithmetical crossover are considered [16, 17].

2. Using the BLX-  crossover (with 0.3? = ), one descendent 1{ }gZ z z=  is obtained, where iz  is randomly generated within the interval [ , ]i il u , with  minmax{ 0.5, }il c I= ? ? maxmin{0.5, }iu c I= +  min min{ , }i ic x y= max max{ , }i ic x y=  and  max min( )I c c ?= ? ? .

3. The application of an arithmetical crossover in the  wider interval considered by BLX- [ , ]i il u  results in the next descendent V with (1 )i i iv l u? ?= ? + ? ? , where (0,1)? ? is a random parameter generated each time this crossover operator is applied.

Mutation: A mutation operator is applied on the RC  part of the four offspring before selecting the two descendents.

This operator flips a gene value in RC .

Chromosome Evaluation: A normalized evaluation function, according to the performance of the control system, is given as follows:  m s sm s sm s  m sm sm  t t e eFitness t e  ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ? ? ? = + +    (6)  where s? , st , se  are the overshoot, rise time and steady-state error for a control system respectively, m? ,  smt , sme  are the maximal values of the overshoot, rise time and steady-state error, and the corresponding values are predefined as 0.1, 0.1, 0.0025, respectively. If m s? ?? , as well as sm st t?  and sm se e? , is negative, we set it to zero. In addition, equation 1? ? ?+ + =  is always satisfied.

Other initiation is provided in the Table I. For this system, we employ the proposed FBRSs system with genetic lateral tuning of MFs and rule selection algorithm. The performance of the resulting FBRSs system is depicted in Figure 7, along with performance of the system with these fixed MFs and rules.

5 CONCLUSIONS This paper proposes a FBRSs system with genetic lateral tuning of MFs and rule selection algorithm for inverted pendulum. The main difference between lateral tuning and the classic GAs approach is the reduction of the search space, focusing the search only on the MF support position.

Although lateral tuning has less freedom than the classic approach, the reduction of the search space could lead to improved performance of the tuning method, especially in complex or highly multidimensional problems. Since the proposed method allows us to obtain easily the best global interaction between the MFs, thereby a good covering degree of the input data can be guaranteed.
