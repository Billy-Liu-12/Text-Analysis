Load Adaptive Multi-Channel Distribution and Arbitration in Unequal RF Interconnected WiNoC

Abstract?An overlaid mesh with unequal RF nodes placement has been introduced to improve network performance of wireless network- on-chip benefited from the greatly reduced network diameter. Traffic however can easily get crowded at big RF nodes due to the sharing and competition of multi-channel usage. To alleviate traffic congestion, a load adaptive channel distribution and arbitration scheme is proposed in this paper. The single UWB frequency band is efficiently shared among the nodes such that more bandwidth is allocated to more potentially congested nodes. Further, higher winning probability is granted to them so as to release earlier crowded traffic. Coping with the uniqueness of overlaid mesh, a three-tiered arbitration strategy is proposed to greatly reduce the contention overhead and improve the end-to-end performance.

The optimization effectiveness and performance impact of the proposed approach is extensively studied and investigated.



I. INTRODUCTION  As transistor density continues to rise unabated, multicore chips are emerging as the pervasive computing model to offer sustained performance growth, power efficiency and computation capacity needed in highly parallel computing. When more and more cores are packed into a chip, the on-chip interconnection has become the performance determinant. Networks-on-Chip have been widely used to replace the conventional shared buses and crossbars to provide a scalable and high-bandwidth communication fabric. Among various NoC architectures, 2D mesh has proven to be most popular granted to its simple, structured and scalable design. It however incurs long network latency mainly due to the large network diameter (i.e., 2(n ? 1) for a n ? n mesh).

To improve the end-to-end performance, an overlaid mesh wireless network-on-chip (WiNoC) [1] has been introduced to greatly reduce the network diameter by flattening the network with long wireless links which can be easily achieved by deploying unequal RF nodes (differed in bandwidth and transmission range) on the 2D grid. As shown in Fig. 1, a m ? m (where m < n) full mesh (i.e., fully connected mesh) of big RF nodes is overlaid on top of the n ? n base mesh formed by small and big RF nodes. Starry ends stretch out from a big node (serving as the zone header) to all the small nodes in a virtual zone. Bridged with long links, overlaid mesh efficiently reduces the network diameter to 3 + ?n?1  ?.

To maintain low diameter, overlaid mesh however incorporates high-radix (up to 12) big nodes, which impose high contention and consequently traffic can be congested at big nodes. In exploration of congestion-aware improvement of end-to-end performance, non- conflicting load sensitive channel resource allocation and sharing is established in this work by utilizing UWB multi-channeling techniques. Uniquely, channel arbitration is coupled with routing to discriminate transmission priority in channel access. Nodes with high congestion potential will be granted high winning probability in channel contention.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II-A, a three-tiered multi-channel assignment scheme is proposed based on UWB receiver coding. By assigning more channels to big nodes, more bandwidth are allocated for data transmission so as to alleviate possible traffic congestion on them. A load adaptive multi-channel arbitration scheme is presented in Sec. III where congested nodes are granted higher winning probability to transmit data according to traffic handling priority. Three-tiered arbitration in coping with the routing sequence is carried out to efficiently reduce contention over- head and improve end-to-end performance. Extensive simulation is conduced in Sec. IV to demonstrate the optimization effectiveness and performance impact of the proposed approach. Finally we conclude this paper.



II. THREE-TIERED MULTI-CHANNEL ASSIGNMENT  Multiple-access capability of WiNoC stems from time hopping which has been widely used for sharing a single impulse-based UWB frequency band among multiple nodes so that a total of Nth =  Tf Tc  channels are available for ?simultaneous? data transmission (where Tc is the chip time and Tf is the sequence frame). As receiver-based time-hopping is much simpler, we will use receiver-based coding to separate different channels.

With multi-channeling, an intuitive approach is to allow each node a dedicated channel for transmission. However, it may result in extremely long sequence frames and accordingly, low per-link bandwidth. It thus encounters underutilization of available bandwidth and entails long delay, especially at low traffic loads. It is important to maximize the per-link bandwidth by distributing minimal but sufficient channels. Further, as more traffic will go through the big nodes to shorten their travel distance by using long links, the big nodes can get overloaded. To alleviate congestion, these nodes may acquire more available channels so that more chances are granted to release the traffic loads. Thereby, we propose a minimal receiving channel assignment scheme which adapts to the traffic load distribution in the network.

A. Three-tiered Receiving Channel Assignment Scheme  By restricting the number of channels, multiple nodes may share the same channel. Consequently, one could encounter collisions when multiple nearby nodes try to transmit data simultaneously on the     same channel, typically two-hop conflicts (where any two receivers which are two hops apart attempt to receive data simultaneously on the same channel). To avoid two-hop conflicts, a static channel assignment scheme has been proposed in [2] which constructs a two- hop receiving conflict graph based on WiNoC topology and applies minimum vertex coloring on it. Deriving a two-hop conflict graph directly from a high-radix overlaid mesh can be quite complicated, not even mentioning the long computation time required for running the vertex coloring scheme.

Aiming at efficient channel assignment, an overlaid mesh is con- sidered to be layered into a base mesh, a tilted big mesh (formed by dotted blue links in Fig. 1) and an upright big mesh (with solid blue links). To gain a better understanding of traffic distribution in overlaid mesh, we may divide a typical overlaid routing into three phases namely routing sequence, where data hops in sequence in base, tilted and upright meshes respectively. For example, an overlaid routing path from source S to destination D is given in Fig. 1 where packets travel across the chip (along base, tilted and upright meshes respectively till the last direct hop) with only 5 hops.

A minimal channel assignment scheme is designed in a way that considers channel distribution on three layers separately in coping with overlaid routing sequence. Assume each layer of mesh a separate wireless connectivity graph, the minimal channel assignment is deduced to finding the minimum coloring of the vertices in a corresponding wireless connectivity graph where no two vertices which are two-hop apart are assigned the same color. It?s easy to find out that all neighbors of a node in a mesh need to be assigned with distinct colors in order to avoid two-hop conflicts. As the maximum node radix of mesh is four, we propose a simple and efficient 4- coloring scheme for channel assignment on each layer.

Note that, each layer of mesh will be assigned with a different set of channels to ensure concurrent data transmissions on separate layers and a big node can only take part in data transmission on one layer at a time. A total of 12 receiving channels are distributed among the big nodes. A big node is associated with three distinct channels, one for receiving data in a dedicated layer of overlaid mesh. The small nodes on the base mesh will share only 4 receiving channels and one node is assigned with just one channel. For example as shown in Fig. 2, big node A is assigned with three channels of 2, 5 and 11 for data receiving on base, upright and tilted meshes respectively.

B. 4-Coloring Scheme  Without loss of generality, we use a n ? n mesh (such as base mesh in Fig. 2) to illustrate it. Starting from the vertex at the bottom left corner. Vertices are listed vertically in columns of 1 to n and horizontally in rows of 1 to n. Coloring is performed in two steps.

We first color the odd columns.

? If the column number divided by 4 gives a reminder of 1, the vertices in this column from bottom to top will be colored in  the sequence of 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3,... repeatedly.

? If the column number divided by 4 gives a reminder of 3, the  vertices in this column from bottom to top will be colored with the sequence 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1,... repeatedly.

In the next step, the remaining unassigned vertices on the even columns will be colored. They are simply given the same color as their neighbors on the left odd column as shown in Fig. 2. It?s worth mentioning that four receiving channels are necessary and sufficient to avoid two-hop conflicts in a mesh at any network scale.



III. LOAD ADAPTIVE MULTI-CHANNEL ARBITRATION  While two-hop conflicts are effectively avoided by channel as- signment, collisions may occur when multiple senders direct data to the same receiver simultaneously. For lossless data transmission, an efficient channel arbitration scheme is essential to resolve the contention among the competing senders. In overlaid mesh, the big nodes intend to get overloaded as more traffic will go through them by using the long links. An arbitration scheme can essentially reduce the delay if it may grant congested nodes higher winning probability to transmit data. Aiming at resolving channel contention and easing traffic congestion, a load adaptive multi-channel arbitration scheme is thereby proposed.

A. Receiving Priority  Assume w.l.o.g time is divided into superframes. A series of subframes constitute a superframe. Each subframe is divided into two intervals: a channel contention interval where multiple potential senders compete for the same receiving channel; and a data transmis- sion interval where the winning sender transmits data to the receiver.

Each interval consists of a number of slots.

1) Big Node?s Arbitration Framework: A big node?s contention interval contains at most 4 slots for transmission request, ?REQ? and 1 slot for request authorization, ?ACK? as shown in Fig. 3 (a).

Up to 4 neighboring potential senders located on a particular layer may compete for a dedicated receiving channel of a node at one time. Each REQ slot is dedicated for one potential sender to send its transmission request. A node may receive up to 4 requests at a time, which will be arbitrated in a round-robin fair manner. Only one of them will be authorized in ACK slot and consequently, the winning sender will adapt its channel to the receiver and transmit packets in the transmission interval.

Fig. 3. Illustration of subframe architecture.

A big node is associated with three different types of subframes which differ in priority level and data transmission interval. To ease traffic congestion at a big node, priority is set to accept traffic loads delivered on different layers. The highest priority is given to the loads sent along the tiled mesh and will be first considered for receiving.

As all small nodes in a virtual zone have to forward their packets to the zone header in order to access the long links, these traffic needs to be delivered as earlier as possible. Their senders will compete for the dedicated channel in Subframe P1. The traffic delivered on the upright mesh needs to be handled next such that they may arrive at the destination earlier, and are granted the second highest priority.

Accordingly, their channel contention is conducted in Subframe P2.

At last, in order to avoid too heavy traffic to be injected into the full mesh than what it can handle, the traffic loads forwarded from the base mesh will have the lowest chance to be considered for receiving, thus the lowest priority. The arbitration is performed in Subframe P3.

The higher a layer of overlaid mesh is loaded with traffic, the longer packets are waiting to be delivered. Thus we vary the trans- mission interval in length of 15, 10 and 5 slots respectively for type 1 to 3 subframes. In other words, 3 packets are received in serial from a sender in tilted mesh, and 2 and 1 in upright and base mesh respectively. To meet the synchronization requirement, the packet length is carefully designed in a way that ensures complete packet transmission in exactly 5 slots. Note that a subframe may not contain any transmission interval at all if no transmission request is initiated in any of its request slots. The potential sender loaded with higher priority traffic won?t send request unless enough number of packets has been accumulated, while a small potential sender may initiate request immediately.

The big node?s superframe is illustration in Fig 4 which corre- sponds to three different cases. As mentioned earlier, a big node is associated with three receiving channels ChRi (i ? [1, 2, 3]), each for receiving data in a dedicated layer of overlaid mesh according to their priority level. By default, the node is initialized to receiving channel ChX1 at beginning of each superframe.

? Case 1: The superframe only contains Subframe P1 which indicates that several neighboring potential senders on tilted mesh compete for its receiving channel ChR1 , and one of them wins the channel contention which sends 3 packets in a row to the receiver.

? Case 2: It contains both Subframes P1 and P2. As no requests are initiated in P1, it contains no transmission interval. Right after the channel contention of P1, the node will switch its receiving channel to ChR2 . It?s ready to receive requests sent from the neighboring senders in the upright mesh. Arbitration among these requests is carried out in a fair manner and only one is granted the channel authorization. Similarly, the winning sender will adapt its channel accordingly and send 2 packets sequentially in the transmission interval.

? Case 3: If no requests are initiated in P1 and P2, the node will again switch to receiving channel ChR3 . It accordingly enters Subframe P3 where the neighboring small senders in base mesh will compete for the channel.

Note that when a sender is granted with channel authorization in one of the three cases, all other competitors will give up their attempts and wait for the next run of contention in the following superframe.

2) Small Node?s Arbitration Framework: Small nodes? superframe is much simpler which contains exactly one type of subframe. The subframe is again divided into channel contention interval fixed at 6 slots and data transmission interval with 5 slots as shown in Fig. 3 (b). As a small node will have up to 5 neighboring potential senders (including one big node via a direct link and four small nodes located on the base mesh), there are up to 5 slots for transmission request.

Specifically, the first slot is reserved for its big neighbor sending request, which is given higher priority than other four slots dedicated for the small neighbors. It?s simply because the packet sent along the last hop should be forwarded first so that it can be consumed by the destination earlier. If the node receives a request from its big neighbor, it will grant its channel to it without further authorization.

If the big neighbor has no waiting packets, the potential small senders may send requests in their dedicated slots. These requests are arbitrated in round-robin. Only one will win and be granted with channel authorization. Once the winning sender receives the authorization signal, it will adapt its channel and transmit a packet in the transmission interval.

B. Sending Priority  While receiving priority at a node is properly justified, it?s im- portant to determine the priority for sending requests if the node has multiple packets waiting to be sent out along different layers of overlaid mesh. A small node will only deliver packets on the base mesh, so all its transmission requests get equal chance to be sent out.

We will randomly pick any one of them. A big node may forward packets to its big neighbors on either tilted or upright mesh or to its small destination node via the direct link. To efficiently push forward the traffic towards their destinations, the highest priority is given to the packet transmission request sent along the last hop, the second highest to the request sent on the upright mesh, and the lowest priority to the one sent on the tilted mesh.



IV. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION  A. Experiment Setup  A simulator is developed to evaluate the performance of the pro- posed load-adaptive multi-channel arbitration (LAMCA) in overlaid mesh WiNoC. Each RF node is assigned receiving channels to properly allocate the wireless bandwidth. Each RF node is facilitated with overlaid routing, LAMCA channel arbitration, virtual output queuing, and backpressure based flow throttling. The experiments are carried out under three different synthetic traffic to exhibit typical communication patterns in real workloads: uniform, where each RF node uniformly injects packets into the network with randomly generated destination; one-hot spot, where one randomly picked node accepts 50% of overall generated traffic while the remaining is uniformly distributed among all other nodes; transpose, where a node at xy-coordinates of (x, y) sends its packets to node at (y, x).

The simulations are conducted in a 12 ? 12 overlaid mesh with 4?4 full mesh (where the big nodes are placed at distance of 3). The wireless bandwidth is set at 10Gbps. We run the first 2000 cycles for system simulation warmup. Then the generated 10,000 packets are injected into the network at each injection rate setting until they reach their destinations. We evaluate the network performance in terms of network throughput, end-to-end delay, and aggregation bandwidth under different traffic injection rate. The network throughput is defined as the average rate of successful packets delivery over the network. The end-to-end delay is the time spanned to deliver a packet successfully from a source to a destination. The aggregate bandwidth is the aggregate rate of successful packet transmission through all the     nodes in the network, which represents the transmission concurrency in the network.

B. Comparison of Channel Arbitration schemes  The performance of the proposed LAMCA scheme is compared with two other multi-channel arbitration schemes, mSD-MAC and DATA/ACK. The former implements a separate wired control channel for channel access control handshaking besides the wireless channels, and interleaves wired control handshaking and wireless data trans- mission [3]. The later is a simple DATA/ACK based multi-channel arbitration scheme without handshaking, which is derived from the IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol [4]. The comparison results are given in Fig. 5.

Fig. 5. Performance comparison under different channel arbitration.

As we can see, LAMCA reduces latency by 31% and 42% over mSD-MAC and DATA/ACK respectively. It?s simply because LAMCA goes for a cross-layer design which results in a more efficient customization by coupling with the uniqueness of topology and routing. LAMCA particularly handles well heavy traffics as it is designed to efficiently tackle the traffic congestion problem.

mSD-MAC although improves performance by interleaving control handshaking and data transmission, such layered approach cannot efficiently alleviate traffic congestion in overlaid mesh, resulting in 32% worse throughput than LAMCA. DATA/ACK delivers the worst performance as its none-handshaking based arbitration approach cannot efficiently handle traffic collisions. It works poorly when the traffic gets heavier.

C. Comparison Under Different Traffic Patterns  We evaluate the network performance of overlaid mesh WiNoC implemented with LAMCA under three different traffic patterns: uniform, one-hot spot, and transpose. The simulation results given in Fig. 6 demonstrate that the best performance is achieved under the transpose traffic where the traffic is most evenly distributed and the routing paths are much shorter. It achieves 20% higher throughput than that under uniform traffic. Worst performance is observed under the one-hot spot traffic where the network saturates quickly under light traffic density.

V. CONCLUSION  A congestion-aware multi-optimization strategy has been proposed and investigated in this work to efficiency tackle the traffic conges- tion problem and exploit the performance potentiality of overlaid mesh WiNoC. Design customization is performed by following a cross-layer design principle which couples channel arbitration with network routing. To most efficiently distribute and share the minimal number of channels, unequal bandwidth are assigned in coping with traffic density distribution. The proposed channel arbitration scheme grants higher winning probability to congested nodes by properly establishing receiving and sending priority. Significant performance improvement has been demonstrated to highlight such coherent optimization-motivated cross-layer design strategy.
