Signature Modeling for LWIR Spectrometer Alexer H. Firpi

Abstract?Hyperspectral longwave infrared (LWIR) is used for a variety of targets such as gases and solids with the advantage of day or night data collections. A longwave infrared system must have the ability to convert the radiance data it measures to emis- sivity prior to running a detection algorithm, commonly called a temperature-emissivity separation (TES) algorithm. Key parts of this TES algorithm are accounting for the reflected down- welling radiation from the atmosphere, upwelling background radiance removal, and most importantly determining the tem- perature of the material. Accounting for these environmental conditions allows for the data to be processed in emissivity to be used in the detection algorithm. The processed data also allows a baseline to determine where key features exist in the signatures collected. In this paper a new method is introduced to process field collected signatures gathered using the Design & Prototypes microFTIR Model 102. The issue addressed here is calculating the collected signature from radiance to emissivity using a new technique for estimating the surface temperature of the collected sample. The key component of the TES was created to ensure the collected spectra are processed in emissivity space at a quality that is suitable for the detection library on air and ground LWIR systems.
