Outcome Prediction in Traumatic Pelvic Injuries Using Maximum Similarity and Quality Measures

Abstract  Traumatic pelvic injury is frequently life-threatening due to its association with severe hemorrhage and the high risk of complications. Immediate medical treatment is therefore of utmost importance; however, decisions regarding treat- ment are often very difficult to make due to the amount and complexity of patient information. The use of a computer- aided decision making system to help trauma surgeons as- sess the severity of a patient?s condition, and to make more reliable and rapid treatment decisions, could improve care giving standards and reduce the cost of trauma care. This paper focuses on creating such a system based on the rules derived through CART and C4.5. The system is designed to predict the eventual outcome of a trauma case home or rehab - by using maximum similarity, measure of discrimi- nation, specificity and sensitivity to form a reliable decision regarding a patient?s condition.

1. Introduction  Traumatic pelvic injuries are most commonly caused by motor vehicle accidents or falls from great height [3]. They are difficult to both diagnose and treat, and are responsible for the death of 5%-30% of victims [6],[7]. Pelvic fracture commonly associated with closed head injury, long bone fracture, peripheral nerve damage and thoracic injury [2].

The significant mortality rate is a consequence of the high risk of complications, including severe blood loss. Accord- ing to [8] motor vehicle crashes are responsible for ap- proximately 82% of blunt abdominal trauma case, a sig-  nificant percentage of which is accompanied by pelvic in- juries. Pelvic fracture is typically diagnosed by trauma surgeons, who look for specific symptoms such as bone ten- derness, difficulties in moving and walking and signs of bleeding in the intestinal or genital system. In addition, the surgeon may use x-ray, MR or CT images to determine the presence and location of the fracture. Other physiologi- cal and demographic data are also collected for the patient, such as blood pressure and age, and in the case of traumatic injuries, Injury Severity Score( ISS) and Glasgow Coma Score( GCS). Using a considerable volume of data, the sur- geon is required to make a series of rapid, time-sensitive decisions regarding patient treatment. Decision making in trauma care is a challenging problem, not only due to the many complex variables involved, but also due to the ur- gency of the decision and the stressful nature of the emer- gency room environment. The use of computer-aided deci- sion making systems could not only assist and improve the decision-making process, but also reduce the costs of care giving. The majority of the currently used computer-aided decision making systems for trauma rely solely on statis- tical studies of the demographics of patients with similar conditions [4]. Such an approach may lead to an inaccurate and biased decision and therefore might be inappropriate for real trauma cases. The method used in this paper is based on rules derived from demographic trauma scores and phys- iological information.

2. Methods  Previous studies have explored the use of CART and C4.5 to generate reliable rules for trauma decision-making.

IEEE IRI 2008, July 13-15, 2008, Las Vegas, Nevada, USA     However, in these studies, the rule bases generated by the two algorithms remained distinct. The accuracy of the pre- diction may therefore be improved by using the combined decision of CART and C4.5 and a weighted version of the measure of discrimination [1] in place of the classic ver- sion. The decision will be made according to the rule from CART or C4.5 [5] that most closely fits the given case and also has a higher quality. The CART and C4.5 rule bases used here are designed to predict the exact outcome for pa- tients with pelvic injuries. In this paper, the focus is on predicting the exact outcome of traumatic pelvic injury pa- tients upon leaving hospital, i.e. whether they will be able to go home or will require rehabilitation. Consider the first rule in Table 3 as an example of how the rules are inter- preted: the CART rule recommends that a patient younger than 47.15 years, with an Emergency Department Glasgow Coma Score( EDGCS) lower or equal to 13 who has been administered a quantity of fluids greater than 2000 units is going to be classified as a Rehab case. The method used in this paper has a combined hierarchical approach:  Step 1: compute similarity of each rule; Step 2: select the rules with maximum similarity for each  of the two algorithms. Four maximum similar rules will re- sult from this: one for CART Home, one for CART Rehab, one for C4.5 Home and one for C4.5 Rehab;  Step 3: compute quality coefficients for each of the four rules. Quality coefficients are weighted versions of the mea- sure of discrimination. The weights are specificity or sensi- tivity of the rule;  Step 4: predict outcome based on the separate outcomes given by maximum similar rules.

The measure of discrimination, QMD, is the ratio be- tween the positive and negative odds of an instance being in class C, given rule R [1]. It evaluates the extent to which a rule R can distinguish between relevant and non relevant instances of class C.

QMD = log P (R|C)(1? P (R|C?)) P (R|C?)(1? P (R|C))  . (1)  Since decisions in trauma care must be highly accurate, those rules falling below a certain reliability threshold must be eliminated from the rule base. As a result, it is possible that a given case does not have a perfectly matching rule in the existing rule base. A solution for classifying cases, regardless of whether they are perfectly captured by a rule, must therefore be developed.

2.1. Dataset  The dataset used in this study was created in collabora- tion with Carolinas Healthcare System and consists of 667 traumatic pelvic injury cases. Of these 667 cases, 286 cases required further rehabilitation and 381 resulted in the pa-  tient being sent home. In addition to demographics and physiological information, the database also includes values for trauma scores as GCS and ISS. Other relevant informa- tion, such as the tests and medical procedures that were per- formed, is also included. Logistic regression was performed in the phase of rule extraction for identifying the most sig- nificant attributes [5]. Table 1 presents the five variables and their possible values.

2.2. Methodologies  Consider rule R. R may classify a case as either Home or Rehab, and be generated by either CART or C4.5. Let posi- tion - pos from now on - of an attribute in rule R be defined as the depth of the sub-tree leading to R for that particular attribute. Weight of an attribute in rule R is defined as:  2(noAtr + 1? pos) noAtr(noAtr + 1)  , (2)  where noAtr is the number of attributes considered by rule R. As shown in (3), the weights of all attributes considered by a rule sum to one.

noAtr? pos=1  2(noAtr + 1? pos) noAtr(noAtr + 1)  = 1. (3)  Each case in the data set will have an outcome score, OS, computed for each one of the rules. This is calculated as:  OS = ?  posact  2(noAtr + 1? posact) noAtr(noAtr + 1)  , (4)  where posact is the position of each activated attribute. An attribute in a rule R is activated for a specific patient if its recorded value falls in the interval required by rule R. Rule R is f(xt), where f : X ? Y , X is the set of patients and Y is the set of outcomes.The rule with maximum similarity to a given case is given by the relation:  max (OS(xt)|f(xt) = yt). (5)  Therefore we will have 4 most similar rules for each of the 667 cases, one for each category of rules. The cate- gories are CART Home, CART Rehab, C4.5 Home, and C4.5 Rehab. Each rule R has a corresponding measure of discrimination value, which after Bayesian transformation becomes:  QMD = log[ P (C|R) P (C?|R)  ? P (C?)? P (C?) ? P (R) P (C)? P (C) ? P (R)  ]. (6)  Here, P (C|R) is equal to the accuracy of the rule, where accuracy of a rule is the total testing result of the rule as     shown in column 2 of Table 3 [5]; P (C?|R) is equal to the complement of rule accuracy; P (R) is the probability of a rule as computed for this set of data and rules; and P (C) and P (C?) are P (Home) = 0.5712 and P (Rehab) = 0.4288. After calculating the probability of true positives pTP , the probability of true negatives pTN , the probability of false positives pFP and the probability of false negatives pFN for each rule R. Specificity and sensitivity can be cal- culated as:  specificity = pTN  pTN + pFP (7)  and: sensitivity =  pTP pTP + pFN  (8)  for each of the 40 rules. Of these, 34 are generated by CART, with 20 predicting Rehab as outcome, and 14 pre- dicting Home. The other 6 are generated by C4.5, with 3 predicting Rehab as outcome and 3 predicting Home. The specificity and sensitivity of the rules are used to weigh the measure of discrimination. As previously mentioned, each case will have four most similar rules associated with it. In determining the outcome according to CART or C4.5 alone, we choose the outcome of the most similar rule with the highest value for OS weighted with: ? the value of the measure of discrimination; ? the value of the measure of discrimination and the  specificity of the rule; ? the value for measure of discrimination and the sensi-  tivity of the rule.

In making the combined decision, we choose the outcome predicted by the majority of the individual decisions. There- fore each case will have twelve scores for outcome from four maximum similar rules (maximum similar rule of CART Rehab, maximum similar rule of CART Home, max- imum similar rule C4.5 Rehab, maximum similar rule C4.5 Home) each of them weighted with measure of discrimina- tion, measure of discrimination and sensitivity and measure of discrimination and specificity. So there are six scores that correspond to Rehab and six that correspond to Home. The combined outcome is the one that gets most of these scores to agree.

3. Results  Specificity, sensitivity and probability of misclassifica- tion were chosen as measures of accuracy. Table 2 com- pares the results of the three methods that were used and the combined decision of the two algorithms. For the traumatic pelvic injury dataset the prediction is slightly improved when using the measure of discrimination weighted by rule specificity or rule sensitivity, as compared to using the mea- sure of discrimination alone. When using the specificity- weighted version, overall specificity for the CART and C4.5  rules is increased by 18% (36% relative percentual increase) and 20% (40% relative percentual increase) respectively.

Sensitivity is increased by 15% (25%) and decreased by 9% (11%) for C4.5 rules using the same method. When using the sensitivity weighted measure of discrimination, speci- ficity is increased by 5% (10%) and 33% (66%) for CART and C4.5 respectively. Sensitivity improves by 6% (10%) and is decreased by 18% (23%) for CART and C4.5. The combined decision has an increase of 13% (26%) in speci- ficity and 0.25%(4%) in sensitivity compared to the average specificity and sensitivity when using the measure of dis- crimination alone. The percentage of misclassified cases is 43% when using only the measure of discrimination. When the measure is weighted with the specificity of the most sim- ilar rules the percentage drops to 27% using CART rules and 33% when using C4.5 rules. Weighting the measure of discrimination with the sensitivity of the most similar rules results in only 38% and 33% of the cases being misclassi- fied for CART and C4.5, respectively. The combined deci- sion of the two algorithms misclassifies 32% of the cases.

4. Conclusions and future work  In this paper a decision making system that integrates the separate decisions of CART and C4.5 was created. In particular, we applied it to the field of medical decision- making, specifically relating to traumatic pelvic injury cases. Decisions made by the base method, using maximum similarity and the measure of discrimination, with versions of teh proposed method weighted with either specificity or sensitivity of a rule were compared. Future work will in- volve testing the weighted methods against a larger dataset.

However, we found that in this particular case the weighted method results in higher prediction accuracy, and therefore this method may be of use in our work on medical decision- making systems.
