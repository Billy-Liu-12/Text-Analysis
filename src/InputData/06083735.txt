A Supervised Learning Framework for PCA-based Face Recognition using GNP Fuzzy Data Mining

Abstract?Traditional PCA-based face recognition algorithms usually have low performance in the complicated illumination database. There are two reasons. One is that the number of classes is large compared with other classification problems. The other is that the data in the PCA domain distributes in a narrow space and overlaps frequently. This paper presents a novel supervised learning framework for PCA-based face recognition using Genetic Network Programming (GNP) fuzzy data mining (GNP-FDM).

In the proposed framework, a face recognition oriented genetic- based clustering algorithm (GCA) is used to reduce the number of classes and overlaps in the recognition. And, a fuzzy class association rules (FCARs) based classifier is applied to mine the inherent relationships between eigen-vectors and to improve the recognition accuracy. Experimental results on the extended Yale-B database indicate that the proposed supervised learning framework has higher accuracy compared with the traditional PCA-based methods.

I. INTRODUCTION  As a representative subspace analysis approach, principal component analysis (PCA) has been widely applied to various classification problems [1], [2]. There are also many PCA- based face recognition systems proposed recently [3], [4], [5].

However, all of them fail to perform well in the complicated illumination database (CID). Two reasons account for this phenomenon. One is that the number of classes in the face recognition is very large compared with other classification problems. The other is that the data in the PCA domain distributes in a narrow space. Due to the large number of classes, overlaps between data occur frequently. Moreover, geometric distances, i.e., Euclidean distance and Mahalinobis distance, are a kind of average distance between all the eigen- vectors. Thus, the geometric distance is ineffective to measure the difference between images in the overlapping region.

Generally speaking, increasing the number of images per person in the training set could somewhat improve the per- formance of the PCA-based face recognition algorithms. And yet, the traditional PCA-based face recognition algorithm using multiple training images per person (MTIP) still can not achieve high accuracy in the CID as shown in Fig. 1, where the accuracy under different number of classes is the average results of 500 rounds of experiments and the training images per person is selected from 11 to 50 using the extended Yale- B database. The reason is that the large number of classes  Fig. 1. Recognition accuracy of the traditional PCA-based face recognition algorithm using Mahalinobis distance  makes the data distribute intensively in the narrow region and overlaps occur more frequently. In this paper, we focus on how to improve the performance of the PCA-based face recognition algorithm in the MTIP-CID.

Previously, some researchers devoted to improve the perfor- mance of the PCA-based face recognition algorithms in various ways. Oravec [6] applied support vector machine (SVM) to find the decision hyperplane. Yang [3] and Kwang [4] extended the PCA into two dimensional and kernel space, respectively.

And, Perlibakas [7] analyzed 14 distance measures for PCA- based face recognition. However, these proposals could not solve the problems caused by a large number of classes and complicated illumination environment.

Clustering is the simplest approach to reduce the impact of a large number of classes on the PCA-based face recogni- tion method. Research on the sequential learning framework for clustering and classification [8], [9], [10] has proven that clustering results in the training data set can enhance the generalization ability in classification. Although Cai [11] pointed out that such kinds of sequential frameworks fail to compromise the clustering and classification performances, it is very difficult to design a simultaneous framework for most of the applications, i.e., face recognition. To maintain a rela- tively high accuracy, we proposed a face recognition oriented genetic-based clustering algorithm (GCA) and a sequential framework using GCA and the traditional PCA-based face recognition algorithm.

However, the geometric distances [7], SVM [6] and other traditional classifiers can not perform well in the MTIP-CID.

Fig. 2. Flowchart of the proposed supervised learning framework for PCA- based face recognition  It is because the relationships between eigen-vectors are not fully exploited. In contrast, class association rules (CARs) based classifiers have attracted a great research interest and obtained satisfactory results in many applications [12], [13].

To achieve the balance between efficiency and effectiveness, some researchers proposed the evolutionary association rule mining methods based on genetic algorithm (GA) [14] and genetic programming (GP) [15]. Yet, GA and GP have low exploration ability for CARs mining because of their simple representations of solutions. As a result, Karla [16] proposed a Genetic Network Programming (GNP) based fuzzy data mining framework (GNP-FDM). GNP-FDM can easily deal with either discrete attributes, continuous attributes or both.

Its performance has been also demonstrated by many real life applications, i.e., traffic prediction [17] and intrusion detection [18]. But, there still exist some problems in the GNP-FDM: 1) It also suffers from the accuracy loss as the number of classes increases. 2) There are a large number of rules in the Fuzzy CARs-based classifier (FCARs-based classifier), which results in a low efficiency for recognition.

Consequently, a supervised learning framework for PCA- based face recognition using GNP-FDM has been proposed in this study. The proposed framework is consisted of three phases, i.e., database conversion, training and testing. In the database conversion, PCA is performed to transform the high dimensional training facial database (??) to a low dimen- sional real-valued database (?????), its corresponding binary database and fuzzy membership database. In the training phase, ????? is firstly decomposed into a two-layer database ??2??? using the face recognition oriented GCA. Then, the GNP-FDM is applied to each cluster and a FCARs-based classifier is constructed. In the testing phase, the testing image is firstly classified into a certain cluster by minimizing the Mahalinobis distances to all cluster centroids. Finally, the recognition is realized by maximizing the score using the FCARs-based classifier.

The main characteristics of the proposed supervised learn- ing framework are summarized as follows.

1 GNP-FDM is able to extract a plenty of FCARs without the bloating problem found in other evolutionary algo- rithms like GP based methods. And the FCARs-based classifier is more accurate than other traditional classifiers [16].

2 GNP-FDM of the proposed framework can be performed in all clusters in parallel and different user specific pa- rameters like minimum support can be used for different clusters.

3 The number of classes in each cluster is as small as other classification problems, usually 3 or 4, in which the FCARs-based classifier constructed by GNP-FDM can easily achieve a high accuracy. In this way, a relatively high recognition rate can be maintained even if the num- ber of classes is large. On the other hand, the classification is realized in a specific cluster, which successfully reduce the influence of the overlap in the MTIP-CID.

4 Suppose there are ? classes and ?? rules for each classes, the time complexity of the classifier constructed by the traditional GNP-FDM is ?(???); in contrast, it is ?(?+ 3??? ) or ?(?+4?  ? ? ) in the proposed framework, where  ? is the number of clusters in the proposed framework and ??? is the number of FCARs for each class. Usually, ? = ?/3 or ? = ?/4.

The outline of the remaining of the paper is given as fol- lows. Section II explains the details of the proposed supervised learning framework for the PCA-based face recognition using GNP-FDM. Experimental results are summarized in Section III. Section IV concludes this paper finally.



II. PROPOSED SUPERVISED LEARNING FRAMEWORK  To maintain a relatively high recognition accuracy of the traditional PCA-base face recognition algorithm, a supervised learning framework is proposed in this study, the flowchart of which is shown in Fig. 2. Before applying GNP-FDM, a face recognition oriented GCA is performed to decompose the facial database to a two-layer database, in which the number of classes for the PCA-based face recognition is controlled under 4. Therefore, the effectiveness and efficiency of the PCA-based face recognition are both improved. The notations and definitions used in this paper are defined as follows.

? ??: the ??? image (?? ? 1); ? FD: training database of ? persons with ? facial images  per person; ? ? =(???1,???2,? ? ?,????): transform matrix (?? ? ?), ? is a  user specified parameter; ? ????: the ??? largest eigen vector (?? ? 1); ? ?? = ?? ? ?? = (?1, ?2, ? ? ? , ??)? : the ??? instance  (?? 1) of the ??? image in ??; ? ???: set of instances of images in the PCA subspace; ? FDsub={?1, ?2, ? ? ? , ??}: set of classes of FD; ? ??: the ??? class of images; ? ?? = {??1 , ??2 , ? ? ? , ???}: set of instances of class ?; ? FD2sub={??1,??2,? ? ?,???}: set of clusters of FD; ? ???: the ??? cluster consisted of ?? classes; ? ????: centroid of cluster ???;     Fig. 3. Fuzzy member function of the ??? attribute in ???  ? ???={???1 ,???2 ,? ? ?,???? }: set of instances of the centroid ????;  ? ????? : class of the centroid ?? ? ?;  ? ???????Type: geometric distance between ?? and ?? ; Type = ? means Euclidean distance, Type = ?? means Mahalinobis distance (M-dist);  ? ??? ????Type= min ?=1,2,???,?  ??? ???? ?Type; ? ??? ????Type= 1?  ? ?=1,2,???,?  ???? ???? ?Type; 1) Database Conversion Phase: The calculation of ???  using PCA is defined by (1),  ??? = ? ? ??? ? ??, (1)  ???? = argmax ?  {?????? ?} = (???1,???2, ? ? ? ,????), (2)  ?? =  ??  ? ?=1,2,???,?  ? ?=1,2,???,?  (??? ? ?)(????? )? , (3)  where, ???? is the optimal transform matrix; ?? is the scatter matrix of ??; ? is the number of persons and ? is the facial images per person in FD; ??? is the ?  ?? image of person ?; ? is the mean facial image of FD.

Then, ??? is fuzzified into a binary database and its fuzzy membership database by the fuzzy membership function shown in Fig. 3, where ?? and ?? is the mean and standard deviation of the ??? attribute ?? in ???, ?? corresponds to the ???  eigen vector of the instances of images; and ? = ? = 0.5 is used in this study. An example is given by Fig. 4. ??? with ? = 4 and ? = 3 is shown in Fig. 4(a) and its fuzzy membership database is shown in Fig. 4(b). Then, if the value of the fuzzy membership is larger than 0.5, it is recorded as 1 in the binary database. The binary database of ??? is shown in Fig. 4(c). There are two advantages. One is that the traditional association rule mining techniques can be easily applied to the binary database. The other is that the fuzzy membership database keeps the properties of the continuous data to some extent.

2) Training Phase: The training phase is consisted of three steps, i.e., database decomposition, GNP-FDM and FCARs- based classifier construction.

? Database decomposition: To prevent the accuracy loss caused by a large number of classes in the face recog- nition, a face recognition oriented GCA is used to de- compose ??? to a two-layer database ??2???. Using  Fig. 4. An example of ??? and its corresponding fuzzy membership database and binary database  the example in Fig. 4, ??2??? = {??1, ??2}, ??1 = {????1 = ?1, ?4} and ??2 = {????2 = ?2, ?3} are obtained for example after data based decomposition.

The chromosome of the face recognition oriented GCA has ? genes and each of them corresponds to a cluster centroid. Elite selection and tournament selection are used to generate the next generation. Single point crossover and nun-uniform mutation are used to explore and exploit the solution space. The objective of GCA is to find the optimal cluster centroids by maximizing the fitness function defined by (4),  ? = ? between-classDist within-classDist  , (4)  ? =  ? ??  ?=1,2???,?(?? ??0)2 , (5)  within-classDist =  ?  ?? ?=1   ??  ??? ?=1  ???(?)???????, (6)  between-classDist =  ??? ??  ?=1  ?? ??=1  ???? ????????, (7)  where, ? is the number of clusters; ?? is the number of classes in the ??? cluster; ?0 is the target number of classes in each cluster, and ?0 = 3 or 4 is recommended; ??(?) is the set of instances of the ??? class in ??? and ??? is the set of instances of the centroid of ???.

? GNP-FDM: GNP-FDM is then performed in each cluster with only 3 or 4 classes in ??2???.

GNP is one of the evolutionary algorithms and represents a solution by a directed graph structure. Therefore, it has a higher expression ability and better exploration ability in the complex and dynamic environments. A GNP individual is composed of three kinds of nodes, such as start node (S), judgement node (J) and processing node (P). The functions of those nodes can be designed     Fig. 5. One transition of a GNP individual in GNP-FDM  depending on different requirements of the applications.

In GNP-FDM, start node is used to indicate the start position of a GNP individual. Each transition represents a subset of FCARs. Each judgement node corresponds to an attribute in the binary database of ??2???, e.g., ?1 : ?1 = ???, while the precessing nodes evaluate the candidate rules using the interesting measures of rules.

The union set of all the FCARs are used for classification.

Encoding and decoding: The chromosome of GNP in GNP-FDM is a directed graph as shown in Fig. 5.

In the first generation, the connections between judg- ment/processing nodes are generated randomly. In this way, a group of candidate rules are encoded in a GNP individual. In the decoding, GNP-FDM checks each transition one by one to generate candidate rules. As shown in Fig. 5, every transition of a GNP individual represents a set of FCARs, i.e., ?1 = ? ? ? = ?1, ?1 = ? ? ? = ?2, ?1 = ? ? ?2 = ? ? ? = ?1, ?1 = ? ? ?2 = ? ? ? = ?2 and so on, where, ? means ????. Then, every FCAR is evaluated by the minimal support, confidence and Chi-square values. If it satisfies all these measures, it is stored into the rule pool.

Genetic operators: In GNP-FDM, tournament selection is used to reproduce the offspring for the next generation.

Single point and two point crossover are used to explore the solution space, while the mutation is to change the connections between judgment/processing nodes.

Fitness function and objective: In order to mine as many important FCARs as possible, GNP-FDM is to maximize the fitness function defined by (8),  ???? =  ????? ?=1  {?2(?)????(?)+10(?????(?)?1)}, (8)  where, ???? is the number of FCARs extracted by a GNP individual; ?2(?) and ????(?) are the Chi-square and confidence values of the ??? rule; ?????(?) is the number of attributes of the antecedent part of the ???  rule.

? FCARs-based classifier construction: Based on the  FCARs mined by GNP-FDM in the second step, the average matching degree of testing data ? with the FCARs of class ? is calculated by (9),  ??(?) = ? ????  ??????(?, ?), (9)  ??????(?, ?) = ??(?, ?)  ??(?) , (10)  Fig. 6. The training set and testing data  where, ??(?) is the average matching degree of testing data ? with the rules in class ?; ?? is the set of suffixes of rules in class ?; ??????(?, ?) is the matching degree of testing data ? and rule ? ? ??; ??(?, ?) is the sum of the fuzzy membership values in the antecedent part of rule ? when testing data ? is given; ??(?) is the number of attributes in the antecedent part of rule ?.

The classification or recognition is then realized by max- imizing the average matching degree.

3) Testing Phase: The testing phase will be explained using the example shown in Fig. 4. Figure 6 shows the distribution of the training data and testing data ?????. Firstly, the M-distance between the testing data and two cluster centroids ????1 = ?1 and ????2 = ?2. Obviously, ????? is classified into ??1. Then, the average matching degrees of ????? with FCARs in ?1 and ?4 are computed. Finally, ????? is classified as ?4.



III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS  The Yale-B database[19] consists of 2414 near front images from 38 persons and each image of those has the size of 192?168. We selected 34 persons from them and examined 3 different setups for PCA-based face recognition experiments.

They are the traditional PCA-based face recognition algo- rithm using M-distance (denoted by PCA+M in this section), GCA+PCA+M and GCA+PCA+GNP. 50 images per person are used for the training and the remaining 14 images per per- son are used for the testing in this paper. The configuration of parameters used in the GCA and GNP-FDM are given in Table.

Thus, we used higher crossover and mutation probabilities than usual.

The average clustering accuracies over 30 rounds of experi- ments on the Yale-B database using the three setups are calcu- lated and shown in Fig. 7. The numbers of classes used in the experiments are {4, 6, ? ? ?, 34}. According to the experimental results shown in Fig 7, the accuracy of the GCA+PCA+M is higher than that of the traditional PCA-based face recognition algorithm. It is because GCA reduces the overlaps in the PCA domain and its influence of a large number of classes on the accuracy. Furthermore, the FCARs-based classifier by GNP- FDM utilizes the relationships between eigen-vectors rather than averaging them by the geometric distances, which obtains the highest accuracy among the PCA-based face recognition algorithms.



IV. CONCLUSION  The effectiveness of the proposed supervised learning framework for PCA-based face recognition has been demon- strated according to the experimental results. It successfully prevents the accuracy loss caused by a large number of classes in the MTIP-CID using the face recognition oriented GCA.

And, the FCARs-based classifier constructed by GNP-FDM has largely improve the performance of the traditional PCA- based face recognition algorithm. In the future work, the proposed supervised learning framework will be performed on other subspace face recognition methods like linear discrimi- nant analysis (LDA).
