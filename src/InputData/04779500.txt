A NOVEL GROUND-BASED MICROWAVE RADIOMETER FOR HIGH PRECISION

ABSTRACT  State-of-the-art microwave radiometers for probing water  vapor, temperature and cloud liquid water do not show the  high accuracy and stability which is needed for some  applications like radio science or the assessment of turbulent  weather conditions. Especially scientific experiments,  performed in outer-space and missions to investigate other  planets, are dependent upon high-precision transmission of  data to receivers on Earth passing through the atmosphere,  which is a big source of disturbance. Propagation and  attenuation at frequencies between a few GHz and several  tens of GHz are influenced by dry air as well as by water  vapour and liquid water in form of clouds and rain. A  precise and stable microwave radiometer to derive these  properties has been developed ? the Atmospheric  Propagation and Profiling System ATPROP.

INTRODUCTION    Atmospheric constituents like water vapor and clouds show  a high spatial and temporal variability. On one hand it is of  high interest for meteorological applications to better  capture the turbulent structure of the atmosphere. On the  other hand atmospheric constituents also control the  propagation of electromagnetic waves. For radio science  applications it is therefore important to accurately describe  atmospheric disturbances.

A precise and stable microwave radiometer to  observe the relevant atmospheric parameter has been  developed in the frame of an ESA-ESTEC project: the  Atmospheric Propagation and Profiling System (ATPROP).

A new calibration technique using a fast cycling between  target, Dicke Switch and noise diode enables highly precise  and continuous measurements. A turntable combined with  internal elevation mirrors allows flexible pointing, for  example tracking individual satellites or mapping the spatial  variability by volume scanning. ATPROP is able to detect  tropospheric profiles of humidity and temperature as well as  the integrated humidity. Using elevation scans, high  resolution boundary layer temperature profiles can be  measured. The possibility of elevation scans as well as  azimuth scans enables the three dimensional detection of  inhomogenities in clouds and water vapor. For the different  applications, e.g. satellite ground stations and meteorology,  retrieval algorithms for the calculation of attenuation at  different frequencies, wet path delay, humidity, etc have  been developed. After a brief technical overview (section 2)  the theoretical accuracy is shown in section 3, examples of  instrument evaluation during a test campaign are given in  section 4 and the ability to describe horizontal  inhomogeneities is illustrated in section 5.

2. TECHNICAL OVERVIEW    The radiometer provides 7 channels on the water vapor line  (Ka-Band; 22.24-31.4 GHz) and 7 channels on the oxygen  absorption complex (V-Band; 51.3-58 GHz) for detection of  humidity and temperature profiles (similar to the Humidity  and Temperature Profiler (HATPRO) [1]). Two additional  channels have been added at the Ku-band (near 15 GHz) and  at the W-band (near 90 GHz). The 90 GHz channel  enhances the detection of cloud liquid water and (compared  to HATPRO) improves the detection of clouds with lower  liquid water path. The 15 GHz channel is favorable for  detecting the onset of precipitation and quantity of rainfall  for most conditions except the heaviest rain events.

The intensity and phase delay of satellite  transmissions depends on atmospheric fluctuations as well  as technical factors such as orbit instabilities of the  spacecraft or thermally driven antenna distortions, etc.

These technically related issues extend to time scales of  thousands of seconds. Laboratory measurements with  ATPROP could confirm an Allan Standard Deviation of  0.01 K@1000 s integration time for Ka band channels, and  better than 0.04 K@1000 s for all other channels.

3. RETRIEVAL ACCURACY    Statistical retrieval algorithms are derived from a large data  set of concurrent brightness temperatures and parameter of  interest; e.g. attenuation, non-dispersive excess path length  (EPL), integrated water vapor (IWV), liquid water path  (LWP). The data base is based on a long-term radiosonde     data set representative for the location of the microwave  radiometer. Radio soundings only observe the profiles of  pressure, temperature and humidity and therefore cloud  liquid water profiles need to be diagnosed. Here we tested  three different models which did not lead to significant  differences retrieval in retrieval performance [2]. Therefore  one cloud model and selected at least for the final retrieval  development. In the radiative transfer the effect of  atmospheric gases is described by the Rosenkranz model [3]  and the one of clouds after Liebe [4]. Multivariate  regressions employing higher order terms are derived  following L?hnert and Crewell [2].

Because the test campaign took place at Cabauw,  the Netherlands, we used a long-term (12-Years), high  vertical resolution radiosonde data set from De Bilt, the  Netherlands (52.06 N, 5.11 E, 4 m over msl). The  manufacturer Vaisala specifies an overall accuracy of 0.5 K  for temperature and 5 % for relative humidity in the  troposphere. However, also depending on the launch  personal, weather condition and transmission quality several  problems in individual soundings can occur. Therefore, a  sophisticated testing program has been developed in the  frame of the ATPROP project and applied to the whole data  set. In order to control the quality of the retrieval algorithms  the dataset is split in two parts of nearly the same size. With  the first part of the data set (training set) the algorithm is  developed, while the second part is used as test data set for  the algorithm derived from the training data set.

3.1. Attenuation    The total atmospheric attenuation is defined as the integral  of the atmospheric extinction coefficient along the line of  sight. Retrieval algorithms for attenuation at all frequencies  between 10 and 90 GHz with 1 GHz spacing were  developed.

Using all ATPROP channels as input for the  retrieval algorithm, attenuation at all frequencies between 10  and 90 GHz can be retrieved to be better than 2%. Table 1  illustrates the accuracy in attenuation retrieval at 22.24, 36.5  and 90 GHz. The attenuation at 36.5 GHz is of highest  interest since it is not directly observed by ATPROP. If  attenuation is derived from the two closest channels at 31.4  and 51.3 GHz the relative error is 3.7 %. It already reduces  strongly to 2.5 % when the full Ka-band (but no V-Band  channel) is used. Obviously the retrieval algorithm can  extrapolate the line shape well. When all 16 ATPROP  channels are used the quality improves even further to 1.5  %. Further studies for other frequencies confirm the strong  benefit of using the 90 GHz and also the 15 GHz channel  compared to a standard profiler.

3.2. Path Delay    In radio propagation applications the non-dispersive excess  path length (EPL) or simply ?path delay? is defined as the  difference of the electrical path length and the geometrical  straight-line distance of a ray propagating from the top to  the bottom of the atmosphere along line of sight. For the  construction of the training and test data set the path delay is  calculated out of the atmospheric refractivity with different  models for the calculation of refractivity. It has been found  that all different variants of calculating the refractivity  yields to very similar path delays with RMS errors of all  different variants between 2.39 and 2.45 mm.

3.3. Integrated Water Vapor and Liquid Water Path    The benefit of 90 GHz channel is most prominent for the  liquid water path due to its high sensitivity to cloud water.

The accuracy of retrieval algorithms using only the Ka band  frequencies and the Ka band frequencies added by 15 and 90  GHz is shown in Table 2. It can be seen that including the  90 GHz channel reduces the RMS from 17 g/m to nearly  the half. Including this frequency enables the detection of  clouds with smaller liquid water content. The same effect  can be found in the IWV but it is not of this strong  dimension (Table 2).

Temperature and humidity profiles    The potential of a ground-based microwave temperature  profiler to combine full tropospheric profiling with high  resolution profiling of the boundary layer has been  investigated by Crewell and L?hnert [5]. In comparison with  tower and radiosonde data they could prove a significant  improvement in the lowest kilometer by combining angular  information from relatively opaque channels with zenith  only information from more transparent channels.

EVALUATION USING RADIO SONDES    Since mid April ATROP has been operated at the Cabauw  Experimental Site for Atmospheric Research (CESAR) in  the Netherlands. In order to evaluate the performance of  ATPROP comparisons with the next radio sonde station (De  Bilt) about 35 km are performed. All cloud free soundings  between 01 June 2008 and 31 August 2008 have been used.

As it can be seen in Figure 1 exemplarily for the 22.24 GHz  channel, the statistical comparison between ATPROP  measurements and radio sounding shows a good correlation.

The soundings show systematically higher values of 1.19 K.

This bias is partly due to the special difference of the  locations of ATPROP in Cabauw in a rural area and the  more urban environment of De Bilt. Therefore the stronger  deviations at frequencies affected more by water vapour  might be explained by humidity variations and uncertainties  in the gas absorption model.

At 26.24 GHz a relative large bias occurs. This is  due to the fact that radio frequency disturbances occurred  during tipping curve calibration. But further, it can be seen  that no drifts of the radiometer can be noticed even though  sky tipping calibration has been disabled all the time.

5. EXAMPLE OF ATPROP MEASUREMENTS    As an example Figure 2 to Figure 4 illustrate a single day,  e.g. 19th June 2008 of ATRPOP observations data.

Temperature and humidity profiles (Figure ) of the whole  day identify the time range of a frontal passage: air mass  exchange can be clearly noticed around 13:00 UTC (red box  all three plots, Figure , Figure 3). Volume scans (Figure 4)  performed at regular intervals reveal the strong spatial  inhomogenities in water vapor and liquid water path at  12:40, 13:08 and 13:36 UTC. Here the exchange of the air  mass from North-West can be identified clearly and strong  differences in both quantities can be found particularly at  the two first time steps.

ATPROP is able to investigate the spatial and temporal  variability of such parameters with high accuracy.

Comparisons of ATPROP measurements with radio  soundings have shown satisfactory performance. Further  comparisons with other microwave radiometer (HATPRO)  show a very high level of agreement (not shown here). The  heated blower system works rather well and allows  immediate observations past a rain event (Fig. 3). The 90  and 15 GHz channels improve IWV and attenuation  retrieval even at frequencies which can not be measured  directly as seen on the example of the attenuation at 36.5  GHz (Table 1). A novel feature of the system is the  detection of spatial inhomogeneities.
