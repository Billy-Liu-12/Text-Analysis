A Ph.D. Curriculum for Digital Forensics

Abstract  This paper presents a curriculum for a doctorate in digital  forensics  and discusses  the  implementation of that  curriculum  in  a  graduate  program.  It  includes overviews of all of the classes and in-depth coverage of specific areas that go beyond the Masters level. It also discusses  how that  program is  being implemented  at the  California  Sciences  Institute,  a  Non-profit California  Public  Interest  Educational  Institution oriented  toward  graduate  education  in  the  areas  of Advanced Investigation and National Security  1. Background This  paper  is  about  a  curriculum  for  a  doctorate  level degree in digital forensics, and it is based on the curriculum currently being implemented at California Sciences Institute.

1.1.The state of the art in digital forensics experts  In  examining  the  state  of  the  art  in  the  field  of digital  forensics,  we  considered  the  fundamental baseline to be the knowledge, skill, training, education, and experience identified in the Daubert decision [1] as the requirement for producing expertise relevant to the field,  and  the  extent  to  which  current  witnesses qualified  as  experts  in  the  digital  forensics  field compare to experts in other scientific fields.

Witnesses admitted as experts to testify in almost every  field  of  scientific  study  today  hold  doctorate degrees in a specific field of expertise associated with their testimony. It is very likely that few if any courts would  accept  medical  testimony  in  a  legal  matter unless  it  came  from  someone  holding  a  medical doctorate.  The  testimony  of  a  nurse,  for  example, would certainly be discounted if it related to the things that only an expert can testify about, and even an MD in  a  different  specialty  would  likely  be  disallowed  unless they could show specific knowledge in the key subfields of import to the matter at hand. The same is true  in  statistics  or  other  mathematical  fields,  in biology,  in  chemistry,  in  psychology,  and in  fact,  in almost any scientific field, this is also true. However; in the field of digital systems, digital forensic evidence is  almost  never  presented  in  court  or  legally  opined upon by someone holding a Ph.D. in a relevant field.

And, because of the relative youth of the field and lack of  academic  attention  to  it  until  now,  in  most  cases where a Ph.D.  is  involved,  they have  relatively  little knowledge, skill, training, education, or experience in the field of digital forensics. Typically, they are experts in some other field relevant to the matter at hand, such as  computer  science  or  electrical  engineering.  While we  are not  aware  of any formal  studies  in  this  area, even in Federal criminal cases, almost every expert we have  identified  presenting  opinions  related  digital forensic evidence is less educated than experts in other fields. Typically, they have B.S. degrees with training certificates from commercial companies.

To get  a sense of how dire the situation is,   select reviews of documents presented to judges for searches showed  that  many  of  these  documents  contain  stock language  that  is  not,  strictly  speaking,  factually accurate.  Review of  expert  reports  commonly  shows errors in the analysis such as incorrect interpretation of Internet RFCs. And many expert witnesses treat RFCs and  similar  documents  as  if  they  were  definitive statements  about  the  manner  in  which  networks actually operate and in some cases, as if they defined a legal mandate for behavior in the Internet.

There seems to be little interest or attention paid to experimental  technique,  and  as  a  result,  many statements  made  in  legal  matters  are  not  consistent with empirical data. Most of the expert reports fail to indicate  any  calibration  or  validation  of  the  tools  in use,  information  on  the  reliability  of  these  tools  is      largely lacking, and there is rarely any depiction of the accuracy of numerical results,  descriptions of sources of error, and indication of how errors are resolved and results validated. It seems that most of this gets past the legal  system because  nobody involved  in  the  matter knows enough,  bothers, or is adequately resourced to challenge the evidence and testimony.

If this continues to be the case, it is highly likely that  the  legal  system  will  start  to  build  substantial precedents  that  are  based  on  expertise  that  is inadequate to the need, and that these precedents will be used for many years to come, producing outcomes and  process  that  is  not  in  the  interest  of  justice.

Furthermore,  unless  and  until  Universities  start  to create  doctorate  level  programs  and  expertise  in  this area, the ?seed corn? will not exist to generate the large number of individuals with expertise to educate others, do  research  to  advance  the  field,  and  work  on  and testify in legal matters.

1.2.Masters degree programs  Many  Masters  programs  in  digital  forensics  exist today, and their coverage is reasonably well known.[3] Typically,  they  involve  classes  in  evidence identification,   imaging  and  other  collection, transportation, storage, and analysis, and presentation; and they commonly involve laboratory experiments or other  practical  experience  in  doing  standard  disk images,  Internet  searches,  basis  investigations, computer-related  crime,  and  some  coverage  of  legal issues.  Many  MS degrees  involving  digital  forensics are  concentrations  within  MS programs  in  computer science or criminal justice departments.  For example, in one program in the context  of a computer science department, [2] the curriculum includes:  Forensic Digital  Imaging  Introduction to Cybercrime  Advanced  Digital  Evidence  Detection  and Recovery  Digital Evidence Search and Seizure  In  our  own  program,  which  emerged  from  the program at the University of New Haven, the Masters degree is in the context of either a national security or advanced investigation program, and includes:  Computer crime and legal and investigative issues  Digital Forensics 1  Digital Forensics 2  Challenges to digital forensic evidence  The program also  has  mandatory  courses  in  white collar crime, deception, counter-deception, and critical thinking,  law  and  evidence,  a  survey  of  forensic science, and a research project or internship. But even this is not the full set of issues that must be addressed in order to truly understand the issues in the field.

Simply put, there just isn't enough time in a Masters program  to  teach more  than  the  basics  of  evidence identification and collection,  limited analysis,  limited presentation,  limited legal coverage, and very limited experience.

2. The doctorate program In order to address what we believe to be the need  for  more  in-depth  knowledge,  better  education,  and more experience and skill, we identified the key items that  we  believe  to  be  missing  in  the  present  digital forensics  programs  at  the  MS  level  and  created  a program  based  on  other  doctorate  level  programs  in similar fields.

2.1.The objective of the additional curricula  What  we  believed  to  be  missing  from  current programs,  including  our  own,  was  a  clarity  and completeness  of  coverage.  This  goes  from understanding  how  digital  systems  work  from  the physics  through  the  user  interfaces  to  understanding the  legal  issues  from the  basics  of  the  laws  through presentation and challenges  in court.  Of course there are limits to what  can be done in a few years of full time study  in  a  graduate  program,  but  the  education and knowledge we provide should be focussed on what the student will need to know as well as what they will need to be able to understand throughout the remainder of their career and life,  based on what  we can teach them.

While  we  would  very  much  like  every  digital forensics expert to understand everything from device physics to electromagnetic  of communicants systems, to theory of computation, to operating system design, to ergonomics, and everything about the legal system associated with a lawyer; in practice, we simply cannot go  that  far.  But  we  can  take  them  from the  lowest levels  of  physics  to  realistic  legal  settings  stopping every step along the way for enough understanding to seed  their  knowledge  and  interests,  and  enough information so that when they give depositions, write      reports, advise others, and testify, the things that they write and say are strictly accurate in every way from a scientific  standpoint,  and  reasonably  well  presented and relevant from a legal standpoint. At least that is our goal.

2.2.Additional courses  At the doctorate level, we augment the M.S. level expertise,  which  must  be  achieved  in  order  to  gain standing  as  a  Ph.D.  student,  with  the  following advanced courses:  ? The physics and mechanisms of digital systems  ? Information  physics:  Time,  Space,  and Computation  ? Operating systems, networks, and applications  ? Programming digital forensic analysis  ? Digital crime scene reconstruction  ? Challenges to digital forensic evidence (at the doctorate level)  ? Research methods  ? Probability and statistics  ? Research with guidance  The  outline  of  this  curriculum  projected  into  a quarter  system is provided in Figure 1. The required courses must be taken in sequence in order to get the full effect of the mock trial, which occurs as part of the final  quarter and is  integrated into  the  Challenges  to Digital Forensic Evidence II courses.

During the first 30 credit hours (red), students must have completed all 600 level courses or have accepted equivalent  transfer  courses  and  credits.  All  students must  participate  in at  least  2 internships  during their first  30  credit  hours  and  must  maintain  a  suitable average and not be on probation at the end of the first 30  credit  hours  of  courses.  Students  wishing  to terminate the program at this point, may opt to receive an  M.S.  degree  in  digital  forensics  by  taking  an additional 6 credits.

During  the  last  quarter  of  the  second  30  credit hours  (yellow),  students  normally  study  and  sit  for their  qualifying  exams.  Upon  advancement  to candidacy,  the  student  will  seek a  dissertation topic, begin work on their dissertation proposal, and select a  dissertation  committee.  Before  starting  their dissertation  (green),  the  student  must  form  a dissertation committee, propose a thesis topic, and gain approval for that topic by their dissertation committee.

Seminar  Dissertation Dissertation Dissertation Dissertation  Figure 1 ? The overview of the curriculum  The physics and mechanisms of digital systems  This course focuses on the details of digital systems and  how  they  operate  at  the  physical,  electronics, optical, and other low-levels.  This course is designed to provide knowledge of the underlying technical basis for  how  digital  systems  work  so  that  the  digital forensics expert can gain clarity around the underlying mechanisms  involved  in  digital  systems  and understand,  explain,  and  testify  about  these mechanisms  as  well  as  evaluate  the  use  of  these mechanisms when applied to legal matters.

Information  physics:  Time,  Space,  and Computation  This course focuses on the underlying mathematics of  computation  and  communication,  covering  the basics  of  information  theory,  issues  of  time,  space, complexity,  and  computability,  number  theory,  their general applications, and their use in analysis of digital forensic  evidence,  questioned  digital  documents,  and related matters.

Operating systems, networks, and applications  This  course  reviews  principles  and  specifics  of operating systems  and applications  ranging  from cell phones to large-scale distributed computing networks.

It  covers  system bootstrap,  execution,  shutdown,  file systems,  network  interfaces,  protocols,  system  calls, execution control, sharing, locking mechanisms, and a range of other related topics.

Programming digital forensic analysis  This  course  focuses  on  writing  special  purpose programs to do analysis of digital evidence. It includes laboratory  exercises  ranging  from  the  creation  of simple  shell  and  perl  scripts  to  the  customization  of special purpose programs for use in forensic analysis.

It brings in open source software tools and customizes them, works through issues in the use of commercial tools,  and works  on the development of test tools to test other forensics software for properties, validation, and calibration.

Digital crime scene reconstruction  This  course  focuses  on  the  use  of  technology  to make  high  quality  reconstructions  of  digital  crime scenes and the limitations of those reconstructions in a legal  setting.  It  goes  from  simple  testing  of  basic claims  and  theories  to  partial  and  nearly  complete reconstructions  of  complex  digital  crime  scenes involving multiple systems and networks.

Challenges  to  digital  forensic  evidence  (at  the doctorate level)  This  course  focusses  on  how  digital  forensic evidence  is  challenged  in  a  legal  setting.  At  the MS level,  this course uses the characteristics and features described in Masters level courses, but at the doctoral level, students with the advanced courses from the rest of the Ph.D. curriculum challenge the challenges of the MS  students  and  challenge  the  evidence  by  taking advantage of the additional knowledge gained through deeper understanding of the physics of the digital and informational  mechanisms,  probability  and  statistics and   research  methods,  advanced  knowledge  of operating  systems,  networks,  and  applications, programmed  analytical  techniques,  and  digital  crime scene reconstruction techniques. This course uses real evidence from real cases and includes realistic creation of reports,  taking  of  depositions,  challenges  to  other students'  and  witness  testimony,  and  concludes  in  a mock trial.

Probability and Statistics  This  course  covers  basic  issues  in  probability  and statistics  from the  perspective  of  challenging  claims about these results. It addresses underlying notions of causality,  the  use  of  statistical  methods  to  refute  the null  hypothesis,  and  the  limits  of  those  methods  for proving  causality.  It  also  looks  at  the  issues  of correlation and the  implications  of  these  methods  as they apply to digital evidence.

Research methods  This  course  focuses  on qualitative and quantitative research methods. It is a course that helps the student gain  clarity  around  the  issues  of  research,  including understanding the limitations of research and science, the  reliability  of different  scientific  claims,  scientific validation processes, and how to evaluate and present limitations  of  scientific  analysis.  This  is  critical  to being  able  to  properly  present  and  evaluate  digital forensic  techniques  and  define  error  rates  and reliability necessary for presentation in legal settings.

2.3.Research requirement  All students must complete at least two quarters of research  before  taking  their  qualifying  exams.  This research  is  under  the  guidance  of a  professor  in  the program  and  is  typically  in  some  area  of  digital forensics. In these courses, the students are expected to become  familiar  with  research  as  it  is  done  by  the faculty and to apply the things they are learning in their courses  to  that  research.  In  most  cases,  during  the course of this research, students will co-author one or more publication quality articles and gain experience in the whole process of research and research publication.

2.4.Admissions and qualifications  To  be  admitted  to  the  program,  students  must possess  a  B.S.  degree  in  a  related  field  from  an accredited  university,  submit  examples  of  previous writings or publications that demonstrate  their  ability to  do  research,  submit  scores  from  the  GRE,  and submit  transcripts  from  their  previous  university courses and degrees.

Students  holding  M.S.  degrees  in  a  relevant  field from an accredited university may seek to have select courses  from  their  previous  programs  counted  as equivalent  courses  to  those  within  this  program  to reduce the course requirements  prior to entering into the doctorate level courses. These will be evaluated on a case by case basis  or, for schools with pre-existing      agreements,  accepted  based  on  performance  in  the previous  institution  in  authorized  M.S.-level  transfer courses.  However;  in  no  case  shall  the  30  resident credit  requirement  for  admission  to  candidacy  be waived or reduced. All courses from the first 30 credit hours must be satisfactorily completed before entering the second 30 hours, however; select courses from the 2nd 30 hours may be entered upon instructor approval.

Specifically,  the  probability  and  statistics,  research methods,  and  operating  systems,  networks,  and applications  courses.  The remaining  courses  must  be taken in sequence for full effect.

2.5.Dissertation and research requirements  As  in  most  doctoral  programs,  students  must  do meaningful research that advances the state of the art, and  write  up  their  results  along  with  the  necessary background,  in  a  dissertation  that  is  comparable  in quality to what  would be found in a refereed journal associated  with  a  professional  society.  Each  student must  complete  and  publish  an  original  empirical  or theoretical  research  dissertation.  Prior  to  starting  the actual  dissertation,  students  must  first  submit  a prospectus for their dissertation that includes a detailed background of the specific area of research, and they typically include this, in large part, in the body of the dissertation as background to their specific work.

2.6.Ph.D. seminar, internships, and related work  In addition, the program requires that students take part in a seminar series in which experts from various disciplines  related  to  digital  forensics  present  up-to- date information on the field. This is likely to involve presentations of issues in legal cases, talks from local, state,  and  federal  law  enforcement,  results  of investigations, talks by visiting faculty members from other  universities,  and  so  forth.  Internships  are typically  required,  however;  for  students  who  are currently  employed  in  the  field,  internships  may  be waived  if  their  regular  work  meets  the  same requirements.

3. Other challenges There  are  four  major  challenges  that  we  face  in  trying to build this emerging program.

3.1.Obtaining faculty  At this point in time, there are very few individuals with Ph.D.s in related fields and who have research and practical  experience  in  the  field  of  digital  forensics.

Most of them are very occupied. As a result, there is a substantial  challenge  in  finding  faculty  to  support  a program such as this,  and in creating a program that will produce Ph.D.s in this field. As in any emerging discipline,  this  challenge  is  met  by  using  a  mix  of experts  from other  fields  and  creating  a  faculty  that fuses their expertise to build the new discipline. As the discipline  emerges,  some  of  the  doctorate  level graduates  then  help  to  populate  other  universities, which  produce  more  resources  that  then  allow  the universities  that  seeded  these  programs  to  reseed themselves.

The approach we have taken is to build faculty from the practical community that exists. CSI is starting to operate in the Bay Area near San Francisco, and as a location where much of the software and hardware of the  information  age  was  developed,  this  area  is particularly  rich  in  expertise  and  experienced  in dealing with  computer-related crime.  While we  draw faculty in specialized areas from all over the country, we don't have the resources or demand required to hire the full time faculty necessary to completely cover all of the expertise involved in our curriculum. As a result, we  use active and recently  retired professionals from the  various  communities  involved,  engage  the  local community leaders in relevant fields,  and spend time and effort getting involved with groups like the local Electronic Crimes Task Force, local law enforcement agencies  and  their  forensic  laboratories,  high technology  businesses,  and  engage  those  who  have worked  in  the  national  security  arena.  Each of  these communities  have  both  substantial  expertise  and substantial need for additional expertise, and by acting as  a  conduit  for  the  exchange  of  knowledge  and formalization  of  that  knowledge,  we  can  help  them while engaging those who have the proper background, experience, knowledge, and desire to become members of the faculty.

At the same time,  teaching Ph.D. students requires that all or most of the faculty have a Ph.D. in a relevant area.  We  are  very  fortunate  to  have  formed relationships with professors from around the country who have  expertise  and experience in  this  field,  and our  faculty  also  helps  to  engage  with  those  other universities to collaborate in helping them to provide expertise for their programs.  For the next 5-10 years, a combination of Ph.D.s from other fields and professors from other universities, industry, and government, will be  used  to  build  this  program  and,  hopefully,  other universities  will  engage  in  this  process  as  well,  to provide us with the seed corn that we need to sustain      our program over time and build the next generation of our faculty.

3.2.Up-to-date materials and cases  A major  impediment  to  success  in  such  programs that has been reported to us by others, and that we have experienced as well, is the difficulty in getting up-to- date materials for many of these courses. For example, in seeking challenges to digital forensic evidence, the use of current cases is potentially problematic because we  may  find  challenges  that  destroy  existing  cases.

While this is potentially an substantial benefit  for the overall  system  of  justice,  the  system of  justice  as  it exists today is oppositional by nature. The strategy and tactics  of  cases  limits  the  willingness  of  many attorneys to provide information on active cases,  and many cases are under seal, or otherwise problematic in terms of getting access to evidence.

While  the  ideal  drama  may  come  from  a  current multiple  homicide  case  in  which  one of the  accused claims innocence and is proven so by a challenge to digital forensic evidence, the reality is that most cases are  civil  litigations  that  are  settled  with  all  evidence and  other  materials  destroyed  or  returned  without public disclosure. In many senses, the openness of the university  is  exactly  the  opposite  of  the  closed  and confidential nature of the relationship between a client and their attorney.

We have been very fortunate in that out relationships with  local  law  enforcement,  those  in  the  legal community, and those in the business community, have allowed us to have a unique perspective on and access to  information  and  situations  that  allows  us  to  get involved  with  public  information  relating  to  a  few cases per year. For those without such relationships, a bit more effort can bring similar results from the public records or from information published by individuals in  specific  cases.  For  example,  in  one  case  we  are using in classes, we were pointed to a public release of formerly  sealed court  papers including an indictment and the supporting information from a search warrant.

This  provides  the  sort  of  material  that  makes  for  a realistic homework assignment for some classes.

Another approach we have taken is to create our own cases.  Of  course  this  is  problematic  in  many  ways, because in order to get a real case with real evidence you have to commit a real crime. The quality of your simulation  drives  the  realism  of  the  digital  forensic evidence,  the  investigation  process,  and  the  results produced.  Another  problem in  this  space is  that  real  cases  may  take  years  to  evolve,  while  in  graduate classes, we have to get something completed within a semester, or in our case, a quarter. While patience is a virtue, our students need a high volume of experience in a short period of time. So unlike real matters where you might drill down for weeks or longer on a specific matter, our students often take small fragments of large complex  cases  and  drill  down  into  them,  and  then move on to the next matter. This is a reasonably good simulation of what  law enforcement  does because of the high volume of cases they process per unit time.

3.3.Arranging practical internships  Practical internships are one of the keys to success in a  program such  as  the  one  we  are  forming  and  the program that it emerged from at the University of New Haven.  While  many  internship  programs  end  up placing students in work environments related to their fields,  many  such  students  end  up  not  doing  work similar to what they expect from their field of interest.

In digital forensics an intern without a clearance cannot work on national security-related forensics, and unless they  sign  non-disclosure  agreements  and  are adequately  trusted  by  the  hiring  party,  they  cannot reasonably  work  on  almost  any  case  that  can  be identified. As a student, they cannot get involved in the aspects  of cases  requiring  testimony because,  among other things, they are expecting to graduate and move on, legal matters often have delays of months or years, and things change on a moment's  notice as a case is closed or settled.

A  best-case  scenario  for  many  programs  is  for  a student to get an internship in a local crime laboratory working on digital forensic evidence related to cases, but  on fairly standard cases  where  one after  another piece  of  evidence  is  treated  in  a  uniform  manner.

While this is excellent training for a student expecting to  get  a  Masters  degree  and  start  to  work  after graduation  in  a  crime  lab,  and  helps  to  build  up relationship  for  both  the  university  and  its  students, there are only so many crime lab jobs near any given location,  and  this  sort  of  internship  at  the  doctorate level is not as useful and does not use the full set of skills  that  would  be  desired  for  dealing  with  legal matters,  won't  likely  produce opportunities  to review live legal cases, and provides only limited insight.

One of the approaches we have been trying to get to work  better  is  in  the  development  of  long-term relationships with local attorneys, prosecutors offices, and national security facilities that deal with the more complex issues in cases, and for whom limited reviews      can be helpful.  As an example,  the language used in many  legal  processes  ends  up  being  copied  from previous  cases  by individuals  who  either  don't  know enough  about  the  details  of  digital  systems  to  do  it themselves  or  don't  have  the  time  to  do  a  custom document  for  each  case.  If  a  police  officer  needs  a search warrant  to get  evidence  from computers,  they cannot really be expected to have a doctorate in digital forensic evidence, and the prosecutor's office may have similar limitations. Projects that serve the community as a whole may be effective here. For example, taking the sorts of paragraphs in use today, you might create an internship  program in  which the  students  develop standard paragraphs for describing standard situations from a legal perspective with regard to digital forensic evidence.  These can then be fused  into  libraries that make the processes more accurate and more efficient for  the  legal  community  as  a  whole.  The  university benefits  from  the  good  relationship,  the  students benefit from the experience, the faculty gets engaged in verifying the results of the effort, and the legal and law enforcement community benefits from having a more sound  basis  for  legal  process  and  better  precedents over time.

We were  very fortunate  in  building  these  sorts  of relationships at the University of New Haven because of the efforts of many of our faculty and the support of our administration of this effort, and this has translated well into the new programs we are now creating.

3.4.Mock trials and similar legal processes  Mock  trials  and  other  similar  legal  process simulations are important and very useful to integrating the  knowledge  acquired  within  the  program  into practical use. Of course for students who  have never seen a courtroom or had any experience on a witness stand or in a legal proceeding, almost any simulation, even  with  a  faculty  member  acting  as  judge,  might seem like a novel experience.  Many of our students are  mid-career  professionals  who  have  had  some  of this experience already. For them, the learning comes from seeing how different  approaches are challenged and succeed or fail, and take things to a deeper level, particularly for new situations that are emerging.

Substantially  meaningful  mock  trials  take considerable time and effort to coordinate and execute.

In order for this  to be effective, students and faculty must be working on the cases for months in advance.

This starts with introducing the cases to the students; making  the  evidence  available  for  review;  having students  do  the  analysis  and  write  expert  reports;  taking  depositions  from  the  students  based  on those reports;  having  students  review  other  student depositions  and  reports  and  prepare  counter-reports and  counter-arguments;  preparation  of  exhibits  for presentation  at  trial,  and  setting  the  order  of presentation for the date of trial. This is done as part of the course work in the quarter in which the mock trials are  to  be  held,  and  these  trials  acts  as  the  capstone experience for the year of study. For this reason, it is our goal to have one week of trials per year, in which judges and lawyers are brought in to try the cases, all of  the  pending  cases  are  presented  to  juries,  and decisions are rendered. The court reporters' transcripts are  then  used  to  review  the  trial  efforts  with  the students and become part of the permanent record for use in future studies and mock trials.

By combining  mock  trials  between the students in the Masters program and the Ph.D. program, redundant effort  can be saved,  and Ph.D.  students  can take the stand after Masters students to demonstrate how taking the science to the next level can help to make or break a case. If each of 25 students is to gain experience in testifying,  it  will  take  several  days  to  get  through  a normal  trial  process.  Jury  are  empaneled  from  the student body and the faculty.

It is advantageous if there are several relatively small and simple cases rather than one large case, because this reduces complexity and allows those who are on one side or another in one case to be jurors in another case.

These  trials  are  designed  to  have  only  expert witnesses, no jury selection process (usually volunteers from the audience), and lawyers with limited roles and almost  no  preparation  time.  Juries  don't  get  to deliberate  for  long,  but  they  do  get  to  vote  on  the outcomes with majority rule instead of total agreement.

Specific issues are brought up across the period of the trials,  like  commonly  used  trick  questions  and questioning techniques.  There are improper questions with  objections,  surprise  pieces  of  evidence  for  the witnesses,  and  other  similar  things  to  keep  the  trial lively, but these are also designed to have educational value.  For  example,  if  a  student  makes  a  mistake  at trial, it may be identified for discussion after the trial when the transcripts are reviewed.

We  envision  participation  by  local  judges  and prosecutors  and  we  hope  that  they  can  also  gain experience  with  specific  types  of  evidence  they  are likely to see in legal cases through these mock trials.

This prepares all of us to better understand the issues at      trial, to better understand the challenges and testimony, and it helps build relationships. This also helps to open opportunities  for  students  and  faculty  and  has  the potential  to  engage  local  law  schools  in  joint collaborative efforts.

4. Summary and conclusions The Ph.D.  program and  curriculum  is  designed  to  move from the level of knowledge typically available in legal matters today, to a level comparable to what is expected  in  other  scientific  fields.  It  does  this  by extending  both  toward  the  underlying  physics  and details of how digital systems operate and toward more in-depth  examination  of  and  experience  with  legal processes.  It  is  intended  to  provide  the  ?seed  corn? required to meet future needs in both education and at trial, and is highly cooperative with the local legal and investigative  communities  while  still  meeting  the academic standards common to doctorate programs in other fields.

This  program  is  still  under  development  and  the authors  welcome  feedback,  collaboration,  and participation from and with the community. For those wishing to find out more, please contact the authors at California Sciences Institute.
