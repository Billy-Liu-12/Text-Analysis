Literature Search Tool for the Extraction of Disease-Associated Genes using Frequent Itemset

Abstract?Biomedical text mining is the process of extracting high quality information from biomedical text. It has a lot of applications in genetics related studies. Information about gene- disease associations is very important in drug design. Laboratory based methods for gene-disease association extraction need more effort and time. Literature mining is a good method for gener- ating candidate set of genes. Manual methods are not suitable for literature mining as it is highly time-consuming due to the high volume of text data. Even though most of the existing gene- disease association extraction methods use abstracts, full text articles provide more association data. This paper proposes an automatic method for the extraction of disease-associated genes using the property of frequent itemsets from full text articles.

The method uses rule based Named Entity Recognition(NER) method for the initial extraction of candidate genes and frequent itemset mining to find the gene-disease associations. Experimental results show that this method gives better precision compared to the existing methods.

I. INTRODUCTION  With the introduction of molecular medicine, the association between diseases and genes has become a very important in- formation. This can be used to correct the fundamental genetic errors that cause the diseases. Text mining, also referred to as text data mining, roughly equivalent to text analytics, refers to the process of deriving high-quality information from text [1].

As the number of articles available electronically increases, effectiveness of text mining also increases. Text mining has a lot of applications in different areas. It is widely used in sentiment analysis.

A. Biomedical Text Mining  One of the main application areas of text mining is the biomedical domain. Biomedical text mining (also known as BioNLP) refers to text mining applied to texts and literature of the biomedical and molecular biology domain [1]. With increase in the number of electronically available publications of the biomedical literature, the scope of biomedical mining has increased. The biomedical text mining is applied mainly for the identification of genes and proteins, finding interactions  and associations between biological entities etc. After the introduction of Human Genome Project [2], the number of articles published in this domain became high. So biomedical text mining is very much useful and efficient for applications like protein-protein interaction extraction, gene-gene interac- tion extraction, drug-drug interaction extraction, gene-disease association extraction etc.

PubMed [3], PMC (PubMed Central) [4], MEDLINE [5] etc are some of the databases that store literature related to the biomedical domain. These databases are good sources of the datasets that we need for the text mining. These databases allow the users to give the query and retrieve the articles.

The users can design the query as per their requirements like publication year, publication type etc.

B. Gene-Disease Association Extraction  A disease can be caused by the irregularities in a number of genes. That means there will be a set of genes associated with each disease. Understanding the genetic causes behind a disease is very important in biological sciences. Gene- disease association extraction is the process of identifying the association between different diseases and genes.

Gene-disease association is an important information for the design of drugs to prevent or cure diseases. In the earlier days, laboratory based methods were employed for finding out the gene-disease associations. These methods were time- consuming and needed a lot of effort. So there was practical difficulty in identifying these associations. If a set of candidate genes associated with a disease/phenotype can be provided be- forehand, then the time and effort for the experimental analysis can be saved. The genetics related literature is an important source of association information. By using literature mining on genetics related articles, it is possible to generate candidate gene sets. Even though manual literature mining is possible, it needs huge amount of human effort. So some automatic mining methods are necessary.

This paper proposes a literature mining tool for extracting disease-associated genes from scientific literature. The input to the tool is the name of the disease. The output is the set of  College of Engineering Pune, India. Dec 19-21, 2016     Fig. 1.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section II reviews the state-of-the-art techniques for identifying gene- disease interactions from the published literature. Section III gives a detailed description of the proposed methodology.

Section IV discusses the results and section V concludes the report.



II. RELATED WORKS  The most efficient method for providing candidate gene sets for a disease before experimental analysis is the literature mining. The existing works related to this area use the con- cept of co-occurrence, network based analysis and machine learning based methods. But a satisfactory method is yet to be introduced.

The methods proposed by Jae-Yoon Jung et al. in 2013 [6] and Sune Pletscher-Frankild et al. [7] in 2014 are based on co- occurrence. Since these methods only consider the abstracts of articles, the associations which are present only in the main text of the articles cannot be extracted. The paper by Sreekala S et al. [8] introduces the Hidden Markov Model for the identification. Here Hidden Markov Model is combined with rule based Named Entity Recognition approach for the identification of gene symbols. This paper takes the full text articles from PubMed for the analysis. So it is more efficient in finding associations that are mentioned only in the main text of the literature.

Xuan Liu et al. [9] proposed the gene analysis for Liver Cancer based on literature mining. In this method the associa- tions are extracted using Bayesian network classifier. Network analysis is used for the gene-disease association extraction in the methods proposed by Changqin Quan et al. [10] and Arzucan Ozgur et al. [11]. A disease-specific gene interaction network is employed in both these methods for extracting the associations.

[12] proposed the DisGeNET, a platform that integrates the available curated and text mined gene- disease association data. The information contained is obtained from databases, namely CTD [13], UniProt [14], Rat Genome Database (RGD) [15] and Mouse Genome Database (MGD) [16]. This paper also proposes a scoring mechanism that considers the supporting evidence available for the gene- disease associations.

The above mentioned methods mainly use the abstract of articles for finding out the associations. Therefore the associations which are specified only in the main text of the articles cannot be identified by the above methods. Most of these methods use a sentence by sentence approach. So it is not possible to extend them to full text articles due to the large size of articles. Moreover, if the negative sentences are not eliminated from text the false positive rate will go high.



III. PROPOSED METHOD  The proposed method considers the full text articles instead of considering only the abstract of articles. Hence associations present in the main text will also be obtained. Since the method uses frequent itemset mining approach [17], [18] for finding the disease-associated genes, most of the negative associations will be eliminated. This method aims to obtain high precision results compared to the existing methods. This method will fetch some new high accuracy associations.

Fig.1 shows the work flow of the proposed method. Pseu- docode of the proposed literature search tool is given as Algorithm 1.

A. Retrieving Articles  The dataset used in this method is a collection of genetics related full text articles corresponding to various diseases, downloaded from PubMed Central (PMC). The PMC provides the facility to query the dataset based on user?s requirements such as publication type, year etc. Only research or review pa- pers are used here as they will give the necessary information.

The PMC query is designed in such a way as to obtain the genetics related articles which contain the disease name or the MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) [19] terms of the disease name in the title of the article. The disease name or MeSH term of the disease name in the title ensures that the paper is relevant for the disease. Five diseases (Alzheimer?s Disease, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Bipolar Disorder, Breast Cancer, Prostate Cancer) are considered for the experiment. Articles are collected for each of the five diseases. The pdf files are then converted to text files in order to perform the text mining.

B. Gene Symbol Extraction  Gene Named Entity Recognition (NER) [20] is one of the major tasks in biomedical literature mining. Most of the articles use gene symbols instead of using gene names directly. Named Entity Recognition methods are of three types: dictionary based methods, rule based methods and machine learning based methods [21].

HGNC (HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee) has pro- vided the guidelines for assigning gene symbols [22]. Accord- ing to these guidelines, all the gene symbol representations should follow some particular patterns. This is represented using the following regular expressions [6]: [A? Z][A? Z0? 9?]+ and C[0? 9]+ or f [0? 9]+  These regular expressions are used to extract the initial set of candidate gene symbols. But these regular expressions detect patterns that do not correspond to gene symbols also.

So dictionary words, disease abbreviations, non-gene genetic terms etc., need to be removed from the obtained results.

After the gene symbol extraction, a set of gene symbols are obtained corresponding to each article in the data set.

C. Frequent Itemset Mining  Frequent itemsets are itemsets that appear in a data set frequently [17]. Such frequent itemsets can be used for mining associations and correlations. The main application of frequent itemset mining is in market basket analysis.

In this paper the frequent itemset mining is used for finding out the correlation between the gene symbols. The genes associated with a particular disease will have a good correlation between them. This idea is used here to extract the disease-associated genes from scientific literature.

The frequent itemset mining is done on transaction databases. So a transaction database needs to be created with the individual articles as transaction IDs and the corresponding set of candidate gene symbols as items. The Apriori algorithm [17] is found to be suitable for the task as it is capable of extracting all the frequent itemsets. The Apriori algorithm is not capable of managing very large datasets. To make it suitable for large datasets, we can use the partitioning based method as given in Algorithm 2 [17], which will divide the large dataset into multiple small datasets and apply Apriori algorithm on each of the partitions.

Algorithm 2 Partition [17] Input: Transaction database B =< T, I > (T - transaction  ID, I - Set of items), number of partitions p.

Output: Frequent itemsets H =< H1, H2..Hy >  1: Let t be the minimum support count 2: Divide B into p partitions B1, B2..Bp 3: for Bi ? B do 4: Fi ?? Apriori(Bi, t?p) where F is the local frequent  itemsets 5: end for 6: Find Global Frequent Itemsets H =< H1, H2..Hy >  using F as the candidate itemsets.

7: return H .

In the partitioning based method, the entire database is first divided into n partitions each containing manageable number of articles. Then the local frequent itemsets are extracted for     each of these partitions. Then these local frequent itemsets are given as candidate sets for the global frequent itemset mining.

Partitioning will reduce the number of database scans needed.

Since the data will not be uniformly distributed in the database, we need to run the partitioning based method multiple times to get good results.

From the result of frequent itemset mining, the correlated gene symbols will be obtained. These gene symbols can be considered as the set of genes associated with the given disease.

D. Gene Ranking  The obtained genes should be ranked based on their sig- nificance. According to the proposed method, the frequency count of gene symbol and its maximum frequent itemset size are the two parameters that determine the importance of a gene symbol. So a formula using the frequency count of gene symbols and the size of the maximum frequent itemset is used to find the score of each gene symbol.

The score for a gene symbol g is calculated using (1):  Score(g) = FC(g)? ?N (1??) (1) where FC(g) - Frequency count of the gene symbol g N - Size of the maximum frequent itemset containing g ? - Tuning parameter (value between 0 and 1)  The gene symbols obtained from frequent itemset mining were ranked using both (1) and by merely counting the frequency of the genes. Both the rankings were compared using the Spearman?s correlation coefficient [23]. The former gave better results compared to the latter one. Therefore, (1) was chosen to rank the genes in our proposed method.

The gene symbols are sorted using the Score to obtain the list of genes related to the given disease ranked according to their significance.



IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS  Articles are obtained from PMC for each target disorder, and the gene symbols associated with the diseases are identified.

The genes are ranked based on their scores. The top 10 genes corresponding to each disease are listed in Table I.

The precision, recall and F-measure of the proposed tool for Breast Cancer is checked by comparing it with the standard gene-disease association database (HuGE Navigator [24]). The performance is obtained by varying the size of the dataset (number of articles used). Fig.2 shows the performance com- parison. There is a slight increase in the value of the metrics as the number of articles used is increased.

The results obtained for Alzheimer?s Disease, using the proposed method for various support values are compared against the HuGE Navigator database [24] to find out the precision, recall and F-measure. The result is given in Fig.3.

It is found that the precision of the proposed method increases with the support value. But as the support value increases, the recall value decreases. That is, as the support value increases,  TABLE I RANKED LIST OF GENE SYMBOLS OBTAINED  Alzheimer?s Disease  Autism Spectrum Disorder  Bipolar Disorder  Breast Cancer  Prostate Cancer  APOE FMR1 BDNF BRCA1 PTEN APP MECP2 CACNA1C BRCA2 TMPRSS2 PSEN1 SHANK3 ANK3 TP53 ERG CLU BDNF BP1 GAPDH GAPDH PICALM CA1 DISC1 ESR1 MYC PSEN2 PTEN MAF EGFR ETV1 CR1 NRXN1 COMT PTEN EZH2 BIN1 TSC1 SDS ATM SDS BACE1 TSC2 CA1 ERBB2 GSTP1 CD33 NLGN3 NRG1 CDH1 KLK3  Fig. 2. Performance for different dataset sizes (number of articles)  the proposed method gives a small set of genes that are actually associated (results with high precision).

Comparison of the proposed method with the existing methods mentioned in [7] and [6] is done by using the same data set. The methods [7] and [6] are based on abstracts only.

So the abstracts of the articles are obtained for the same dataset. The results are shown in Fig.4. The comparison is done by using full text articles for the proposed method and abstracts for the methods [7] and [6].

The precision of the proposed method is found to be higher than that of the existing methods. Since the proposed method uses the concept of frequent itemsets, associations that are present in single papers will be missed out. Hence the recall value of the proposed method is less compared to the existing methods. But when the size of the data set is increased the recall value improves, as can be seen in Fig.2.

The proposed method is tested on full text articles as well as abstracts. The results of comparison is shown in Fig.5. The precision when abstracts are used is found to be better than that of full text articles. But the recall value for abstract based method is much less compared to full text based method. So it is always better to use full text articles than just using the abstracts.

After conducting the experiments using the proposed method, some new genes are found to be associated with the     Fig. 3. Performance for various support values for Alzheimer?s Disease  Fig. 4. Comparison with existing methods  Fig. 5. Performance of the proposed method when used with abstracts and full text articles  TABLE II NEWLY IDENTIFIED GENE-DISEASE ASSOCIATIONS  Gene Name  Disease Name  Supporting Reference  SHANK2 Autism [25] SCN1A Autism [26] BRCA1 Alzheimer?s [27] PINK1 Alzheimer?s [28] E2F1 Breast Cancer [29] GREB1 Breast Cancer [30] FKBP5 Prostate Cancer [31]  diseases. The list of such newly identified associations is given in Table II. Manual checking is done in such cases to find the relevance of the newly identified associations, and some highly scored genes mentioned in Table II are found to be relevant.

The supporting references are also provided in the table for the identified associations. Laboratory based experimental analysis of these gene-disease associations needs to be performed to confirm the validity of the associations.

Since the proposed method uses the concept of frequent itemsets, genes that are present in single papers will be missed out even though they are relevant. This method will not be able to extract those genes that are represented using their names instead of gene symbols. Those gene symbols that do not follow the standard gene symbol representation will not be captured too. Some gene symbol representations may also correspond to some other technical terms in biology. For example, CA1 and CA3 correspond to gene names and are also names of brain regions. In such cases these will be identified as associated genes if they satisfy the support value.



V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE SCOPE  Information about disease-associated genes is very useful in drug design. Efficient methods for generating candidate genes for a disease are much required. The existing tools use the abstract of articles for this purpose, but that may lead to missing the associations present in main text. These methods may identify the negative associations also, which will increase the false positive rate. The proposed method tries to address some of the limitations of the existing methods. The proposed method uses the rule based Named Entity Recognition in full text articles to generate the initial set of candidate genes. Then the frequent itemsets are extracted from this initial set of genes using frequent itemset mining. This method improves the precision of the disease-associated gene extraction. A few new gene-disease associations that are not mentioned in the HuGE Navigator database are also identified. Through the proposed method, we could find out that full text articles are better for mining out the associations than using the abstracts alone. Since the method uses partition based frequent itemset mining, local frequent itemsets for all the partitions can be found out parallelly, thereby reducing the time required for frequent itemset mining. Experimental results show that the proposed method extracts gene-disease associations with much better performance compared to the existing methods.

The proposed method can be extended to more number of diseases. The results of frequent gene set mining can be used for identifying the gene-gene interactions in different diseases.

The genes which are associated with multiple diseases can also be identified. The method can be extended to add drugs also.

Then gene-disease-drug associations can be identified using graph theoretic approaches. These associations will be helpful in drug discovery.
