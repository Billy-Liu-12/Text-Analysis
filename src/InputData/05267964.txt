Abstract?The electrical equipments operation status monitoring, operating performance analysis and assessment is to ensure the safe operation of its important components. A new trouble pattern analysis was put forward based on thought of data mining. The trouble information dimensionality tables come into being by collecting and cleaning up the fault phenomenon. The association rule dimensionality table was made up of the technique parameters and the trouble causes. We analyzed the trouble information by frequent item set of the Apriori arithmetic based on the trouble information dimensionality table and the association rule dimensionality table. We made sure the causes of the trouble and chose the priority resolving scheme by matching the trouble and building and filtrating the candidates. A process of data mining was designed for status information and fault information, Practical results show that the automation level of the management and diagnosis for electrical equipment is improved and it is of great practical value?  Keywords-status monitoring; fault diagnosis; frequent item sets; fault match; electrical equipments

I. ELECTRICAL SYSTEM STATE MONITORING AND FAULT DIAGNOSIS STUDY IN THE PRESENT  SITUATION In the past a long period of time, Because of the  limitation of the diagnosis and assessment techniques, afterwards maintain is the mainly for the Protect and maintain of Electrical system equipment, Electrical system status monitoring and fault diagnosis has undergone some phase of testing, such as instrument testing, manual to determine, system dynamic simulation experimentation analysis, computer analysis and simulation test.

With the progress in manufacturing process equipments and the development of sensor technology, computer technology, a variety of advanced management technology, measuring instruments and equipment have been widely used in electrical system scheduling management, for example, DMS(Distribution Management System), EMS(Energy Management System ), CADA(Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition ), AGC(Automatic Generation Control), LM(Load management), AM/FM(Automated Mapping/Facilities Management), etc. We could get large number of data from these management systems and equipments. To organize and how to effectively deal with these huge amounts of data in real time, and know these  equipments performance and operating status from these data, and reasonable arrangements for scheduling programs, and improve the efficiency of system, the traditional methods of data processing there are some inadequacies. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce the advanced instrument for analyzing and dealing with the data, it is data mining technology, the large number of real-time data was analyzed and mining, and extracting the useful information and rules from the large number of real-time data, Real-time monitoring and understanding the equipment performance and status of electrical system, and to predict, determine and deal with for the Possible failures, so that, it is possible to examine and repair the electrical system state, it could provide a reliable reference for stopping and operation and maintenance in time for the equipment. Moreover, by the trending and relativity analysis in the monitoring system, we could establish the maintenance scheduling in reasonable, and provide technical support for maintenance in reasonable arrangements, thereby, we can effective ensure the security of electrical supply and improve the efficiency of the system. Electrical system monitoring status of the main flow chart was shown in Fig 1.



II. FAULT MODE Electrical system in the long-term operation and  maintenance has accumulated rich experience and a lot of original information, and it is important for enterprises to change these experiences and information into knowledge.

Fault mode is the genuine cause of the fault which is the appearance summarized when the products take place fault.

Fault mode is the one of the main target of data mining, the appearance of fault are classified and cleaned up to form the fault mode is a valuable resource for enterprises. The user's description of fault is often the fault's appearance, and the fault appearance is only the outward manifestation of the issue of fault in many cases, the appearance of fault will     correspond to the fault cause can be cleaned up and analyzed by the experience and relevant technical standards and come  into a standard dimension table of the fault mode. A typical fault mode recorded content as shown in table ?:  TABLE I.  THE  STRUCTURE  OF  FAULT  MODE D IMENSIONS  TABLE  ID Fault properties Description 1 Fault code The fault of unique identifier 2 Fault Statistics Code Used for statistical analysis, the user can determine the statistics particle size 3 Fault Level Fault Level can be divided into mild fault, general fault, a serious fault and a fatal fault 4 fault Parent code The structure of fault mode organized by tree, and definite the logical relationship each other 5 Type of coding parts Identification of the components correspond to the type of fault mode 6 Service time The fault corresponding to the general maintenance services time 7 Cause of  fault The essence reasons for fault 8 Fault appearance The reasons of the fault corresponds to the appearance of common faults(Fault manifestation) ?   Among them, the items 1,2,4,7 are the key elements of  the system and is the basic to deal with the fault information.

The data of the fault mode dimension table initialization comes from the historical experience of enterprise data; Fault mode dimension table can be maintained by automatically and artificial maintenance, the main source of information is the user feedback of the new fault appearance.



III.   DATA MINING -BASED FAULT DETECTION  A. The Gross Structure Design In recent years, data warehouse technology is a better  application, some enterprises set up their own data warehouse and have accumulated a large amount of data, and however, data warehouse to be used as a database in some enterprise, data warehouse has not play an important role in effect. Therefore, people began to study in order to find useful knowledge from the huge data warehouse and to improve the utilization of information. A large number of valuable knowledge would be found from fault information for production, management and for maintenance equipment and circuitry to use for reference, so that, the accuracy of fault diagnosis is improved and the time of fault remove is shorten. Data mining process in the fault information was shown in Fig 2.

The main objective of data mining is to use the correlation of the fault information in data warehouse in order to find the information which is hidden and divinable and understandably and valuable, and to find the model which is easy understand by people to describe the data in the data warehouse. The data was collected according to fault model which was cleaned up and a fairly standard, it is easy for enterprises to establish knowledge dimension table and the relationship rules dimension table, in the data warehouse can be found a large number of knowledge about equipments performance, operation status, scheduling scheme, the cause  of the fault, service decision, etc..., the knowledge play the role of reference and guidance for continuous improving circuit design, process management, electrical load forecasting, electrical market analysis, improving the quality of service in enterprise.

B. Data mining rules The knowledge characteristics of diagnosis field and the  equipment fault mode analysis are provided by a variety of technical parameters or experience, it combined with fuzzy logic methods, production rules based on the uncertain knowledge reasoning were adopted, the general form of the rules as follows:  IF P THEN Q, in which P = P1 (C1) AND / OR P2 (C2) ...

Pn (Cn), P is fault appearance, it could be a simple fault appearance, also, it could be a logical combination by a number of a simple fault appearance, for example, P = P1 (C1) AND P2 (C2) OR P3 (C3);For each fault appearance P1, P2, ..., Pn can be assigned a corresponding confidence value C1, C2, ..., Cn, it is the percentage of the credibility of the fault appearance (probability of the fault appearance); Q is the real reason for the fault ,and it may be one or more conclusions.

A new type of reasoning mechanism was adopted in the fault mode analysis which is inexact matching  based on data mining, and it searches the rules which matches the terms in line with the known, It can generate many different fault conclusions, it is fit for multi-fault diagnosis of intelligent systems. When the quantitative analysis was given prominence to, some knowledge of qualitative judgments were strengthen or weaken the results of quantitative analysis by intelligent systems of highly interactive.

The support plays a decisive role in the Apriori algorithm; the conviction was the first place and gave up the definition of minimum support in the solution. The whole algorithm is divided into three steps: matching fault pattern, generating candidate item sets, filtering the candidate item sets. After "fault mode extraction? in the System, a code aggregate (dynamic string array Arr1) was generated which included the fault reasons.

C. Matching fault mode, to identifying the frequent itemsets about the cause of the fault The code aggregate of the cause of fault was sorted and  generated " Fault_Model":  Model Match  Formalized Record  Fault Appearance Data Formated  Fault Information Object Data  Data Preprocessing Data Extraction  Data Transform  Data Mining  Fault Reason  Knowledge Knowledge Base Conclusion Maintenance Method  Figure 2. The data mining process of status information     Package1: First of all, the sequence of the fault dimension table was created in the data warehouse, the corresponding ID number was found according to these faults number, and the ID numbers were sorted, an array Arr2 was created, it?s size as same as the array Arr1.Then the output results of the Package1 were be converted into numeric, and it kept in the computer's memory as hexadecimal number.

A "Test_Model" was created by the rules of the dimension table records, and with the " Fault_Model " match, then an ideal frequent itemsets and candidate frequent itemsets were generated(Note: Frequent Itemsets 1: ideal frequent itemsets; frequent itemsets 2: the candidate frequent itemsets; frequent itemsets 3: callback frequent itemsets) .The contents of the first record were read in Arr1 which  the qualification  was not empty in the rules dimension table, executing Package1, then the results were saved in another variable ?Test_Model?.

We would be carried out with ?Fault_Model? and ?Test_Model? computing as the rules of data mining were given in previous, the frequent itemsets 1 and frequent itemsets 2 were generated.

At last, traversing each records in the rules dimension table, repeat it, the frequent item sets 1 and frequent item sets 2 were generated. If the frequent item sets 1 is empty while it replaced by the contents of frequent item sets 2, while empty frequent item sets 2.

D. Filter candidate itemsets and decide the fault type Matching fault mode combine with the fuzzy inference  rules to filter the dimension.

When the frequent itemsets 2 is empty, the more of the  special rules and the fault number are priority in rules of the frequent itemsets 1,the aggregate of conclusion?s number could be got immediate in this fault diagnosis by the frequent itemsets 1.The output was a single conclusion if there was only one element in the frequent itemsets 2, the fault was a single fault; Otherwise, the output was more conclusions and the fault was blend faults, more of the fault of electrical electrical equipment and circuits were blend faults.

When the frequent itemsets 2 is not empty, the first, all the rules were deleted if the number of qualification less than or equal the rules of the maximum number in frequent itemsets  1;If frequent itemsets2 is not empty, the ID of rules which was the maximum number of rules for the fault was added in frequent itemsets1(the ID of rules were preserved and the others were removed if there are special rules), at the same time, frequent itemsets2 was deleted, but the rules were signed  and separated  for the original ideals and candidates frequent itemsets,among them, the exceptional fault ID were recorded for the rules of the candidates frequent itemsets (failed to match the fault ID), it is a reference for users.

If the frequent itemsets1 and frequent itemsets2 are empty, then goto the display program for diagnosis directly,  it showed that there no rules match, the system can do nothing for the fault diagnosis, and it can be identified and estimated only by manual.
