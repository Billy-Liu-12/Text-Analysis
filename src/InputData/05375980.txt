An Intrusion Detection Algorithm Model  Based on Extension Clustering Support Vector Machine

Abstract?Intrusion detection technology is a key research direction in information technology. For intrusion detection method based support vector machine(SVM), there is a big obstacle that the amount of audit data for modeling is very large even for a small network scale, so it?s impractical to directly train SVM using original training datasets. Selecting important features from input dataset leads to a simplification of the problem, however a defect caused is the lack of sparseness. All training data will become the support vectors of SVM, which causes the low intrusion detection speed. We propose a novel SVM intrusion detection algorithm model using the method of extension clustering which is utilized to obtain a subset including support vectors. Through this approximation, the training dataset is downsized and consequently the number of support vectors of ultimate SVM model is reduced, which will greatly help to improve the response time of intrusion detection. Comparing to others, the arithmetic model is simple implement and better performance.

So it is worth applying and popularizing.

I.  INTRODUCTION With the development of computer network technology,  more attacks on computer networks are carried out by exploiting unknown weaknesses or bugs always contained in system and application software [1]. Hence, computer security has been receiving a lot of attention in recent years.

Intrusion Detection System (IDS) plays vital role of detecting various kinds of attacks. The main purpose of IDS is to find out intrusions among normal audit data and this can be considered as classification problem.

Two approaches to intrusion detection are conventionally used [2]?one is misuse detection and the other is anomaly detection. Misuse detection is an attack signature-based approach that utilizes a detailed description of the sequence of actions performed by the attacker. This approach detects a series of actions as an attack only if it matches a previously seen attack signature identically. Hence, if a new attack is made, the system fails to recognize it. But due to the requirement of low false alarm rates, most popular intrusion detection systems fall into this category. Another approach to intrusion detection is called anomaly detection. Anomaly  detection is based on modeling the normal activity of the computer system. Unfortunately, the acquisition of profiles of normal activity is not an easy task. The audit records used to produce the profiles of normal activity may contain traces of intrusions leading to misdetections, and also activities of legitimate users often deviate from their normal profile as modeled, leading to high false alarm rates. There are many IDSs developed during the past three decades and most of the commercial and freeware IDS tools are signature based.

But when new attacks appear and amount of audit data increases, IDS should counteract them. In addition to this, as network speed becomes faster, there is an emerging need for security analysis techniques that will be able to keep up with the increased network throughput[3]. Therefore, IDS itself should be lightweight (means relatively low computational cost) while guaranteeing high detection rates. In this paper, we propose a new lightweight intrusion detection model based on extension clustering support vector machine (EC-SVM). Our model mainly focuses on how to effectively detect intrusions in the real-time network environment.

Firstly, we extract several necessary and much important features (named core features) from network traffic dataset by means of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [4].

Secondly, we adopt extension clustering to get a subset including support vectors. Then use the training data in the subset to form classifier for detecting attacks based on the selected features, which will improve detection efficiency and shorten response time.



II.  SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM) Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a learning system  based on statistical learning theory. Theoretically, one main reason for the superior performance is that SVM embodies the Structural Risk Minimization (SRM) principle to minimize an upper bound on the expected risk [5-7].

Geometrically, SVM modeling algorithm works by constructing a separating hyperplane with maximal margin.

Let S = {(x1, y1), (x2, y2), ....... , (xn, yn)} be a training set with input data, where xi?Rn is the training data and corresponding binary class labels yn?{?1,1}. Let the weight and the bias of the separating hyperplane be w  and b respectively, and the SVM classifier is:   DOI 10.1109/AICI.2009.143     ),)(sgn()( bxwxf ii += ?            (1) where ? is a nonlinear function, which maps x the input space into a feature space. To separate the data linearly in the feature space, the decision function satisfies the following conditions and the optimization problem is:  minimize  >=< www ,|||| 2  subject  to  .,......,2,1 ,1])([  ni bxwy ii  = ?+?     (2)  The objective of SVM is to maximize the margin of separation and minimize the training errors. Support Vector machine (SVM) is a newly proposed machine learning approach, which has become a popular research method in intrusion detection, and good results are reported [8-9].



III. INTRUSION DETECTION MODEL BASED ON EXTENSION CLUSTERING SVM (EC-SVM)  The overall model of our approach is depicted in Fig. 1.

In the training process, network traffic dataset is passed to our feature selection engine using PCA approach.

Afterwards, extension clustering is used to build subset basis of original set populated by training data for intrusion detection model. In the testing process, network traffic data will directly sent to our intrusion detection model to detect.

The most advantage of our lightweight model is that by means of feature selection, it can greatly reduce the redundant and least important features for intrusion detection, therefore reduce the computational cost in the process of intrusion detection. Moreover, through extension clustering, the training data was downsized and consequently the number of support vectors of ultimate SVM model were reduced, which greatly helped to improve the response time of intrusion detection.



IV. FEATURE SELECTION Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a powerful  technique for extracting features from data sets. But traditional PCA has several problems. Recently kernel trick has been applied to PCA and kernel trick is based on a formulation of PCA in terms of the dot product matrix instead of the covariance matrix [10]. Kernel PCA(KPCA), however, requires storing and finding the eigenvectors of a N ?N kernel matrix where N is a number of patterns. It is infeasible method when N is large. To extract on-line nonlinear features, we adopt a new feature extraction method [11], which overcomes the problem of memory requirement of KPCA by on-line eigenspace update method incorporating with an adaptation of kernel function.

In this section, we will give a brief introduction to the method of on-line PCA algorithm which overcomes the computational complexity and memory requirement of standard PCA. Before continuing, a note on notation is in order. Vectors are columns, and the size of a vector, or matrix, where it is important, is denoted with subscripts.

Particular column vectors within a matrix are denoted with a superscript, while a superscript on a vector denotes a particular observation from a set of observations, so we treat   observationsas column vectors of a matrix. As an example, imnA is the ith column vector in an m?n matrix . We denote a column extension to a matrix using square brackets.

Thus [ bAimn ] is an (m ? (n + 1)) matrix, with vector b appended to imnA  as a last column. To explain the on-line PCA, we assume that we have already built a set of eigenvectors U = [uj] (j = 1, ? ? ?, k), after having trained the input data xi (i = 1, ? ? ?, N). The corresponding eigenvalues are ? and x  is the mean of input vector. On-line building of eigenspace requires to update these eigenspace to take into account of a new input data. Here we give a brief summarization of the method which is described in [12].

First, we update the mean:  ).(  1' 1+++ = NxxNN  x            (3)  Then we update the set of eigenvectors to reflect the new input vector and to apply a rotational transformation to U.

For doing this, it is necessary to compute the orthogonal  residual vector 11 )(? ++ ?+= NN xxUah  and normalize it  to obtain  1 |||| +  + + =  N  N N h  hh for 0|||| 21 >+Nh and  01 =+Nh otherwise. We obtain the new matrix of Eigenvectors U ?  by appending 1+Nh  to the eigenvectors U and rotating them:  ,],[ 1 RhUU N +=?               (4) where R ? R(k+1)?(k+1) is a rotation matrix. R is the solution of the eigenproblem of the following form:  Network traffic dataset  Feature selection  Network training dataset  Extension clustering  Classifier based SVM  Figure 1.

V.  EXTENSION CLUSTERING  A. Extension set Extension set is the most important concept in the theory  of extenics.

Definition 1: Let U be the universe of discourse; K be a  mapping from U to a real number field I. Then )}(,|),{(~ uKyUuyuA =?= is called an extension set  of U, y=K (u) the dependent function of A~ , K (u) the dependent degree of u about A~ .

}0)(,|{ ??= uKUuuA }0)(,|{~ ??= uKUuuA }0)(,|{0 =?= uKUuuJ  These are called respectively the positive fields, negative field and zero boundary. Positive number expresses that there is the degree of certain characteristic. Negative means that there is not the degree of certain characteristic. Zero means that there is and there is not certain characteristic.

B. Extension clustering Definition 2: Based on definition on extensible set  and the constructing method of its dependent function, we can make an alterable classification for all research objects.

This classification method is called extension clustering method [13].

The followings are the basic steps of extension clustering method:  1) Define classical domain and modulatory domain.

Suppose Ni (i=1,2,...,m) is a subset of set P, and P0 is an  object being tested (P0?P). For judging P0 belongs to which subset, we must define classical domain Ri (i=1,2,...,m) and modulatory domain Rp firstly[14].

? ? ? ?  ?  ?  ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  ><  >< ><  =  ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  ==  ininn  ii  iii  inn  i  ii  ijii  bac  bac bacN  Xc  Xc XcN  XcNR  , ......

? ? ? ?  ?  ?  ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  =  nn xc  xc xcp  R ......

3) Compute dependent degree by dependent function.

? ? ?  ? ? ?  ?  ? ? ?  ? ? ?  ?  ? ?  ? ?  = )(  ),(  )( ),(),(  ),(  )( jij  ij  ijj  jij ijipjj  ijj  ji  Xx X  Xx  Xx XxXx  Xx  xK ? ??  ?  (7)  ? =  = n  j ijj  ijj ij  bx  bx a   /  / (8)  In the formula (8), aij is weight coefficient. It is used to express the importance of each classified characteristic.

? =  = n  j jiiji xkaPK  0 )()(        (9)  In the formula (9), Ki(P0) represents the dependent degree of the object being tested P0.

4) Judge P0 belong to which class.

)(max 0PKK ii =            (10)  We can judge P0 belonging to which class by the value of Ki.



VI. APPLICATION OF THE ALGORITHM MODEL The intrusion detection model based on EC-SVM can be  applied in realistic intrusion detection system. In actual case, we must get core features of network traffic dataset by the new feature extraction approach based PCA firstly. Suppose the selected features are CPU_occupation_rate, duration_time, root_user_access_times, port_scan_times and special_file_access_times etc. Then we should know about their value information of some features in normal and abnormal action by a general survey or previous experience.

Based on the known value information, for example, we can define classical domains and modulatory domain of normal and abnormal action and denote them as R0i (i=1,2) and Rp respectively.

? ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  ? ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  >< >< ><  >< ><  =  5,1___ 5,1__ 5,1___  100,0_ 30,0__ Normal   timesaccessfilespecial timesscanport  timesaccessuserroot timeduration  rateoccupationCPU  R     ? ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  ? ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  >< >< ><  >< ><  =  15,5___ 15,5__ 10,5___ 1000,500_ 100,50__ Abormal   timesaccessfilespecial timesscanport  timesaccessuserroot timeduration  rateoccupationCPU  R   ? ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  ? ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  >< >< ><  >< ><  =  15,1___ 15,1__ 10,1___  1000,0_ 100,0__Action  timesaccessfilespecial timesscanport  timesaccessuserroot timeduration  rateoccupationCPU  Rp    Then using formula (7), formula (8) and formula (9) of  extension clustering, dependent degree of every action belonging to two classes will be computed. For those actions whose dependent degree belonging to the two classes is not much strong. This means these data justly lay in the margin area of the two classes. And support vectors used classify mainly come from the area. So we can collect them together and form a subset basis of original network traffic dataset.

This is the new training dataset for classifier based SVM. By this way, the efficiency of training new classifier will be improved and the cost of response time will be decrease greatly. So the model has great actual value.



VII. CONCLUSION In this paper, we proposed a novel EC-SVM intrusion  detection model using extension clustering to construct a subset basis of original set populated by training data.

Through this approximation, the training data was downsized and consequently the number of support vectors of ultimate SVM model was reduced and the model building time was shortened, which greatly improved the network intrusion detection?s performance. And It provided an instance to explain the actual application of the model. But above research is the first step. There are many works to do after it, such as more details of the model application and so on. The model effectively integrates extenics with SVM. It also  provides a new method for solving intrusion detecting. So the new model has great applied value.
