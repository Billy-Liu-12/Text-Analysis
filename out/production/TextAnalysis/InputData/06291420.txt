Abstract-Data mining provides technical support for the  modernization of traditional Chinese medicine. In this paper,  we focus on the need for finding the relationship between the  properties of traditional Chinese medicine. We build the  database which included 717 kinds of Chinese herbal medicine, and each medicine has 21 properties. With using the technology of association rnle, we build the closely frequent  itemsets in Function-Pharmacology, Function?  Indication ,Function-Western medicine name,Pharmacology?  Indication,Pharmacology-Western medicine name,etc, which  provide valuable information for finding the relationship  between the properties of traditional Chinese medicine.

Keywords:Data Mining;Association Rule; Frequent ltemsets;  Properties of Traditional Chinese Medicine ;  1. INTRODUCTION  For thousands of years, numerous clinical practice and theoretical study has accumulated a great many of traditional Chinese medicine domain knowledge, which is included in the ancient medicine books, literature and current clinical research literature. Meanwhile, a large number of modem Chinese medicine books and journals also contain more valuable information. How to use these vast amounts of medicine data effectively, and how to found the implied relationship in the data, and mining the potential information in the data, which is the problem to the resarchers of traditional Chinese medicine.

At present, the data of traditional Chinese medicine is enormous, while it has the variety of complex composition, which contains more than 10,000 kinds of medicine in current literature. Used as the original herbal medicine,it also has the problem of a different name with the same medicine or a same name with different medicine.Such as Chinese bulbul has more than 20 species of 4 families,and Guanzhong has 35 species of 6 families[l]. Secondly, traditional Chinese medicine has the opposite pharmacological effects, it can cure the disease,while it has adverse effects, the duality and bi-directional make traditional Chinese medicine became more informative and complicated. Thirdly, the compatibility of traditional Chinese medicine was mainly used,the relationship is also    Mingsan Mia02nd  2nd. Department of Scientific Research Henan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine  Zhengzhou, China miaomingsan@126.com  complicated, which exist lots of fuzzy and non-linear relationship.

Finding the relationship in the properties of Chinese medicine based on data mining not only promote the quality standardization of traditional Chinese medicine, but also help reveal the principle of traditional Chinese medicine multi? storey properties contact, which is the important part of the modernization of traditional Chinese medicine. Aijun Lu, etc,[2] used association rule analysis the chemical data of Chinese medicine, and pointed the conceptual differences in the efficacy between the Chinese medicine and Western medicine, they provide a new way for related research on Chinese medicine modernization and plants chemical .Ying Liu[3] used Bayes of data mining to find the association between the function effect of 53 kinds of commonly Chinese medicine "blood circulation" and 17 indicators of pharmacology.A large number of experiment results showed the implicit knowledge of traditional Chinese medicine.

In this paper, we collected information sources from books such as "Chinese Pharmacopoeia", "Traditional Chinese Pharmacology", "Pharmacy"(reference) ", "The Traditional Chinese Medicine Herbal Essence", "Pharmacology of Traditional Chinese Medicine" and "New Traditional Chinese Medicine" ,etc,and selected the traditional Chinese medicine which has good effect, wide application, low cost, easy to use, more contents, and so on.

such as Radix, licorice, etc.

The database include about 20 properties of Chinese medicine herbs, included the performance of medicine, medicine flavour,channel tropism, indications, function, pharmacology,western medicine name,toxicity, compatibility, chemical composition, usage,dosage,etc.We discoveried the relationship in properties of Chinese medicine through analysising system, and provided more comprehensive and reliable information platform for the researchers,and provide technical support for researching and applicating of traditional Chinese medicine.



II. DATA PREPARING AND RELATED METHODS  Data mining is the process of extracting implicit, previously unknown,useful information from large number    of the noisy,fuzzy, random data[4].It has five stages, 1) determine the mining target, 2) data preprocessing, 3) data modeling from the appropriate method, 4) assess the excavation results, 5) advise the next stage though the mining knowledge and feedback results. The sequence of five-stage is not strict, and each stage usually require multiple cycle repeated. Figure 1 showed the main process of data mining.

Figure 1. the main process of data mining  A. Data pre-processing of traditional Chinese Medicine Before data mining,first,we must determine the target of  data mining.In this paper,we build the database with Chinese medicine, include 21 properties of performance of medicine, medicine flavour, channel tropism, indications, function, pharmacology, western medicine name, toxicity, compatibility, chemical composition, usage,dosage,etc.

The ultimate goal of data processing is to reduce the inconsistency and incomplete of the data, that can improve the data quality.It is the key stage to ensure the rational and effective of mining result[5].To discover the relationship between the properties of Chinese medicine based on data mining,data processing is needed to deal with the data of Chinese medicine,and make these data meet the requirements of the algorithm.

In addition,to solve the problem of the same medicine with different name or the same name with different medicine,moreover,part of medicine terms are inconsistent in function, indications,pharmacology.First, we need to do data preparing and data cleaning. Based on the books of "Chinese Pharmacopoeia", "Traditional Chinese Pharmacology", "Pharmacy"(reference)", "The Traditional Chinese Medicine Herbal Essence", "Pharmacology of Traditional Chinese Medicine",etc, and according to the principle of the same or similar mechanisms , we collected, summarized, standard, and input data in Chinese medicine properties and combined with the clinical treatment experiences, which provide a basis platform for the people who research the relationship in properties of Chinese medicine.

In the process of data cleaning and data integration, if according the symptoms to classified, for word in "Abdominal mass","Accumulation","Tumour " are belong to the areas of "Accumulation";"Cancer" is similar to "Anti? tumour", they can be classified as a class, because " Anti? tumour" is more widely to used,so selected the word of "Anti-tumour". If according the mechanism to classified,for word in "thick", "sticky", "condensate", "poly", are all called "Improve blood flow to the degeneration". If according the principle of similar or closely in efficacy to   classified, the word of ''Tongjing ","Tongluo","Tongmai","Tongjingluo", are belong to the "Tongjingluo",such as "Huoxue","Xingxue","Huayu" are belong to "Huoxuehuayu".

In this paper,the database collected 717 kinds of commonly Chinese herbal medicine. One property of database in function include 3023 items, such as "Zhixue","Ziyin","Xiaoji","Huatan",etc.One property of database in pharmacology include 3611 items,such as "Anti? allergy"," Anti-inflammatory"," Affect immune function", " insektizid". The property of indication include 2928 items,the content has "Dryness of cough","Muscle atrophy weakness" ,"Chronic Cough", "Hemoptysis" ,etc. The property of western medicine name include 3289 items, the content has "Indigestion", "Dysentery", "Helopyra" ,"Chronic bronchitis",etc. The property of medicines in compatibility include 691 items, such as "Ajiao-Aiye","Ajiao? Haihake","Ajiao-Puhuang","Baiji-Sanqi",etc.

B. Related methods of data mining Association rule is an important branch of data  mining,it reflects the correlation between the things, and it can found the association or relationship between itemsets from the large amounts of data, these relationships are previously unknown or hidden[6].In the dataset, the large number of records have attribute A, at the same time these records also have attribute B, then we can called A and B constitute a frequent itemset, which indicate the correlation between A and B, these itemsets can be used to observed and analyzed data based on association rule.

Apriori algorithm is proposed by R.Agrawal in 1994, its core is a set of ideas based on a two-stage frequency of recursive algorithm[7]. The association rule belong to the rules of one-dimensional, single,boolean association. The algorithm use the iterative method of a layer search, and analysis the results to find interesting association rule through the "connect" and "prune" in the large amounts of data.First,scanning the full database,and get a total of k from the characteristic properties.Next, collected the minimum support itemsets to generate the frequent l-itemset,then do loop untile finding the frequent k-itemset that collect all characteristic properties. Finally, generated the strong association rules from the frequent itemsets according to the minimum confidence percent. However, Apriori algorithm may produce a large number of candidate itemsets, and may need to scan the database repeatly.

In this paper,we used a algorithm of improved association rule based on Apriori algorithm,and build database with the medical books and literatures.First,we devided Chinese medicine database into n parts, and generate a set of frequent itemsets from each section separately,then collect these itemsets to be a global candidate frequent itemsets.Based on the candidate frequent itemsets, "connecting" and "pruning" on the itemsets until generating the strong association rules. In addition, the    program of data mining running on Matlab R201Oa,and the system provides two ways of access.



III. DATA MINING RESULT  Through a mount of experiments,Based on the improved algorithm we find the closely relationship from the Chinese medicine properties.Finally,we build the relationship itemsets in Function-Pharmacology, Function? Indication, Function-Western medicine name,Pharmacology-Indication, Pharmacology-Western medicine name,etc.

A. The Relationship of Function and other Properties in the Traditional Chinese Medicine  In this paper,we analyzed the relationship in the function and other properties,such as the function with pharmacology,indication,western medicine name,etc.Based on the improved algorithm, we count the maxmum support rate in function with the pharmacology, indications, and western medicine name, the maximum frequency is more closely to the related options.

In the algorithm,with the function of 3023 items in Chinese medicine,we find the maximum frequency itemsets of function with other properties are "Clearing heat", "Deintoxication", "Relieve pain", "Detumescence", "Hemostasis" "Dispel the wind","Blood circulate",etc.Table 1 showed the maximum frequency itemsets in Function-Pharmacology.

IV. CONCLUSIONS  As a powerful tool of acquiring knowledge in a large number of data, data mining was used in all kinds of fields of Chinese medicine, it offers a new technical support to the modernization process of Chinese medicine. While the complexity and uncertainties of the Chinese medicine make the data mining techniques exist some difficult problems in researching Chinese medicine.In this paper,we build the related herbal medicine database, and use the method of division in improved algorithm based on Apriori,to find the relationship between the properties of Chinese medicine.Finally,we build the most closely frequent itemsets in Function-Pharmacology, Function-Indication, Function-Western medicine name, Pharmacology? Indication,Pharmacology-Western medicine name,etc.

However, There are still some problems in the data pre-processing, the Chinese medicine exist the problem of a same medicine with different name and a same name with different medicine, we only compare with the keywords according to the ancient medicine books or literature, which bring the minor errors. Only combined with the semantic processing technology, the accuracy of data mining results can be improved. In future, we plan to combined semantic with data mining in the Chinese medicine data, and add more useful informations,to find the valuable relationship in   the database for the people who studied in the field of traditional Chinese medicine.
