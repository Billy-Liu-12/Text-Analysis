LOCAL, NONLINEAR ADAPTIVE CO-REGISTRATION OF MASTER AND SLAVE INTERFEROMETRIC SAR COMPLEX IMAGE DATA FOR HIGH QUALITY DIGITAL  ELEVATION MAP GENERATION  Ryo Natsuaki and Akira Hirose  Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Systems, The University of Tokyo  1. INTRODUCTION  Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is a key technology in geoscience [1] [2] [3]. In the generation of a digital elevation map (DEM), the elimination of singular points (SPs) is the most important process besides the phase unwrapping (PU). A SP means a point where the phase ro- tation is not zero in the interferogram obtained by InSAR [4] [5] [6] [7]. What yields the SPs? One reason is a big cliff actually existing in the observation region. Empirically, such cliff-generated SP pairs (positive and negative SPs) are located at a distance from each other. Contrarily, other SP pairs, which make up the majority of the SPs, emerge closely to each other. Such close pairs arise from the autointerference caused by the diffraction in electromagnetic-wave propaga- tion including the local permittivity fluctuation effect related to moisture vapor density in the air and other effects. We call the former the global SPs, while we do the latter the local SPs [6].

That is, the local SP pairs does not reflect real landscape, but originate from incidental phenomena in the electromag- netic propagation. We have distortion in the pixel values at the local SPs and their vicinity. Based on this idea, we pre- viously proposed a method to reduce the distortion at around the local SPs and, eventually, to eliminate the local SPs [7].

In this paper, we go one step further. We propose a method to mitigate the distortion in the co-registration process. In our new method, when we co-register two complex image data (master and slave, hereafter) to obtain an interferogram, we adjust the relative position very locally and nonlinearly to re- duce the harmful distortion. As a result, we eliminate local SP pairs, while preserving global SPs, which construct natu- ral cliffs. Accordingly we obtain a high quality DEMs.

2. THE LOCAL AND NONLINEAR ADAPTIVE CO-REGISTRATION METHOD  A typical conventional co-registration process is as follows.

prepare a window of 64?64 pixels, for example, to calcu- late correlation, and we determine the spatial correspondence between the master and slave windows in a sub-pixel precise- ness such as 1/32 pixels. By repeating this process, we obtain a set of correspondent points (tiepoints). Based on the tie- points, we determine an affine transform assuming a bilinear or biquadratic function for the global co-registration. That is, we rearrange the slave image against the master. Then we multiply the master pixel values by the conjugate slave val- ues, pixel by pixel, to obtain the interferogram. Afterward, we apply the earth ellipsoid compensation to cancel the earth surface curvature, if needed.

Then the interferogram includes the following informa- tion: (i)earth surface landscape, (ii)local distortion generated by autointerference in the propagation explained above, and (iii)landsurface movement in the time interval between master and slave observations, if any. We neglect (iii) in this paper.

We eliminate the effect of (ii) by using our method.

In our proposal, we compensate the distortion in the co- registration process locally and nonlinearly after we obtain a temporal interferogram with the typical co-registration men- tioned above. First, we calculate the rotation value to mark local SP pairs in the interferogram. Then we focus one or a few of the SP pairs at once, and prepare a small window that contains the pair at the center. We interpolate the master and slave data in the window to obtain an interpolated data represented with sub-pixel coordinates. In the sub-pixel coor- dinate in the slave, we modify the pixel position, locally and nonlinearly, in an adaptive manner that the center pixels move largely, while the edge pixels move only slightly, so that the local SP pair vanishes in the local sub-pixel interferogram.

Then we reconstruct an ordinary (1-pixel) -coordinate inter- ferogram from the local-SP-free sub-pixel interferogram. We repeat this local modification process over the whole image, and finally obtain a compensated global interferogram that is free from the local SPs.

We are successful in reducing the number of local SP pairs in the interferogram by employing the local, nonlinear adap- tive co-registration. Figure 1 shows an example of interfero- grams and SP maps with and without the method for JERS- 1 complex-amplitude image data. Examining signal-to-noise (SN) ratios of resulting DEMs, we find that the process real-     izes the elimination of propagation-related distortion without loosing / modifying the landscape information.

3. SUMMARY  We have proposed a local, nonlinear co-registration method to eliminate the local SP pairs and related distortion. In the pre- sentation, we show the obtained DEMs and discuss the quality by presenting SN ratios and other quantitative DEM data.
