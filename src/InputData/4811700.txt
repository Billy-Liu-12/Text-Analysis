Discriminating Important Ocean Salinity and  Temperature Patterns in Argo Data

Abstract?Ocean salinity and temperature variations have been observed for decades to clarify their effect to global climate changes. Data mining techniques are effective in extracting implicit and useful information from large databases. Discovering salinity and temperature variation patterns from Argo ocean data will in turn help reveal the spatio-temporal relationship between salinity and temperature variations. However, some of the discovered patterns are trivial because they are already known to the oceanographer. In this study, the water mass (a water body with the same salinity and temperature), the mined salinity and temperature patterns and an entropy importance measure are combined to discriminate important patterns from trivial patterns. This study measures both the patterns with variations in both antecedent and consequent parts that belong to separate clusters, and that belong to the same cluster. A pattern is classified as important if its importance measure exceeds a predefined threshold. The important patterns are transformed into fuzzy rules in a fuzzy inference model to obtain more accurate salinity and temperature variation predictions.

Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed model.

I. INTRODUCTION Knowledge about the variations in ocean salinity and  temperature may help us understand ocean circulation and its impact on climate change. Data mining techniques can be applied to ocean data to gain insight into ocean salinity and temperature variations and then subsequently using this insight to predict future salinity and temperature variations. For example, ocean data can be converted into market-basket type transactions and then traditional association rules mining can be applied to discover interesting salinity and temperature variation patterns. Patterns discovered by traditional association rules mining algorithms do not reveal the relationships between salinity and temperature variations that occur across different time intervals. Tung et al. [10] proposed an inter-transaction association rules mining algorithm for discovering patterns that reveals item associations across multiple transactions. In this study a spatial reference method is used for defining spatial transactions and an inter-transaction association rules algorithm is used for extracting ocean salinity and temperature variation patterns that reveal information such as time and location. An example of an inter-transaction association could be ?if the  salinity rose from 0.15psu to 0.25psu in the east-northeast sector near Taiwan, then the temperature will rise from 0  to 1.2  in the east-northeast sector further away from Taiwan during the following month?. Inter-transaction association rules are more informative than traditional association rules, such as ?if the salinity rose from 0.15psu to 0.25psu, then the temperature will rise from 0  to 1.2 ?. However, not all the salinity and temperature patterns provide useful information.

In oceanography, water mass identification and their spatial-temporal variations provide better understanding of ocean circulations [6]. Water mass is defined as an identifiable body of water which has physical properties, such as temperature and salinity, distinct from surrounding water.

Typically, pattern may be trivial if the salinity and temperature variations in both antecedent and consequent parts belong to the same water mass (spatial cluster). This study proposes an importance measurement that is based on information gain to discriminate important patterns from trivial patterns. Two pattern types are evaluated: those where the antecedent and consequent parts belong to different water masses and those where antecedent and consequent parts belong to the same water mass.

Formally, this can be described as follows. Let },...,,{ 21 neeeE = be a set of n distinct salinity or temperature  variations. The salinity and temperature variation pattern is denoted as BA ee  that Ae  is subset of I and occurs in the spatial cluster 1C ; Be  occurs in the spatial cluster 2C . A pattern, BA ee , is considered important if and only if both  Ae  and Be  are important. The importance of BA ee  can be measured by the uncertainty and similarity of Ae  with other salinity or temperature variations in 1C  and uncertainty and similarity of Be  with other salinity or temperature variations in 2C .

The remaining parts of this paper are organized as follows.

Section 2 summarizes the problems at hand and introduces related work. Section 3 describes the proposed algorithm and section 4 provides experimental evidence. Section 5 concludes the paper.



II. RELATED WORKS This section describes work related to the mining of  inter-transaction association rules and importance measures for mined patterns.

A. Data Transformation of Argo Data Argo is known as a global array of 3,000 free-drifting  profiling floats that measures the temperature and salinity of the upper 2000m of the ocean [1]. This study utilized Argo data collected at 100m-depth that is made freely available to members of the International Argo Project and the national contributing programs (http://www.argo.ucsd.edu, http://argo.jcommops.org).

Argo data are recorded in NetCDF format and each Argo file stores the measurements for one specific float. The goal of this study is to find the ocean salinity and temperature variation relations in the waters surrounding Taiwan. Inter-transaction association rules mining is employed for discovering salinity and temperature variation patterns. However, association rule mining algorithms assume that a finite set of disjoint transactions are given as input to the algorithms [3, 9], and there is no explicit finite set of transactions in an Argo data set.

This study adopts the strategy proposed in [9], where the spatial transaction is defined around the instances of a special reference feature. Taipei is chosen as the reference site and concentric circles are used to define neighboring regions to the reference site. Fig. 1 shows this reference centric model. The concentric circles are also used to annotate the location of the salinity and temperature variations. The sub-zones defined by the concentric circles represent different distances and directions to the reference site. For example, sub-zone A2 is in the east-northeast sector far from Taiwan, and sub-zone A1 is in the east-northeast sector close to Taiwan. Thus, contextual location information is maintained.

Salinity and temperature data extracted from Argo NetCDF files are only considered useful if the measurements are taken within the concentric circles. The monthly mean is computed and compared to the 10-year monthly mean to derive monthly variation data. The same monthly variations within the concentric circles are treated as a single transaction.

B. Inter-transaction Association Rules Traditional association rules express the associations among  items within one transaction [10]. The rule ?if the price of item A goes up, then the price of item B will drop? is an example of a traditional association rule. It is different from the rule ?if the price of item A goes up, then the price of item B will drop the next day?, that can be found by employing inter-transaction association rules algorithm. This section introduces fundamental concepts, definitions and the proposed approach to inter-transaction association rules mining.

Definition 1. Let },...,,{ 21 uiiiI =  be a set of items. Let D be a dimensional attribute and )(DDom  be the domain of D.

A transaction database is a database containing records in the form ),( jId , where )(DDomd ?  and II j ? . We call this type of database a one-dimensional database. The dimensional  attribute usually describes the occurring time or location of an item.

An inter-transaction association rule that spans p intervals is found if an association exists between items that are p intervals apart. Since an inter-transaction association rule may encompass many intervals, finding all such rules is time-consuming. In order to minimize the effort involved in mining uninteresting rules, a sliding window denoted by w is introduced. When mining inter-transaction association rules, only the rules spanning shorter than or equal to w intervals are considered. The sliding window is thus used to avoid mining rules that span many consecutive intervals [4].

Each sliding window forms an inter-transaction. An inter-transaction M that is contained within W can be described as follows:  },10,1];[|)({ ??????= wjukjWijiM kk  where W is a sliding window with w intervals and u is the number of items in },...,,{ 21 uiiiI = .

To distinguish the items in an inter-transaction from the items in a traditional transaction, the items in an inter-transaction are called inter-transaction items. The set of all possible inter-transaction items are denoted I ? . Given I ? and w, then:  )}.1(),...,0(),...,1(),...,0(),1(),...,0({ 2211 ???=? wiiwiiwiiI uu  The following is the definition of an inter-transaction association rule.

Definition 2. An inter-transaction itemset is a set of inter-transaction items IB ??  such that ukBik ???? 1, .

Definition 3. An inter-transaction association rule has the form YX , where  1. ., IYIX ???? 2. .1,)0( ukXik ???? 3. .0,1,)( ????? jukYjik 4. {}.=?YX  Definition 4. Let Txy be the set of inter-transactions that contains a set of extended items YX ?  and Tx be the set of inter-transactions that contains X. Let S be the number of transactions in the transaction database. Then, the support and confidence of an inter-transaction association rule YX can be defined as:  .

|| ||  , ||  sup x  xyxy  T T  confidence S  T port ==  (1)  As with intra-association rules mining algorithms, a minimum support, minsup, and a minimum confidence, minconf, are given and the task is to discover the inter-transaction association rules from the transaction database with support and confidence greater than or equal to the minimum requirements.

C. Salinity and Temperature Variation Patterns Importance Measurement Oceanographers are usually interested in the interactions  among different water masses as these can provide information     about ocean circulations. Temperature-salinity diagram (T-S diagram) can be used to identify water masses or clustering techniques can be employed to identify water masses based on salinity and temperature measurements [6]. There are four types of water masses surrounding Taiwan, i.e., Kuroshio Water in the east of Taiwan, Kuroshio Branch Water and South China Sea Water in the south of Taiwan and China Coastal Water in the west of Taiwan [6].

The mined patterns contain spatial information in both antecedent and consequent parts. Salinity and temperature variations in these two parts may either belong to the same or different water masses. Patterns with similar variations in both antecedent and consequent parts are not important if those variations belong to the same water mass. Usually, only patterns that have variations in both antecedent and consequent parts that belong to different water masses are of interest.

An entropy measure can be used to quantify the importance of a pattern [11] and hence the discovered rules. The uncertainty and similarity of variations in their clusters are measured, respectively. The details are provided in the next section.



III. MINING STRATEGY AND IMPORTANCE MEASURES Tung et al. proposed a framework for the discovery of  Boolean inter-transaction association rules [10]. However, Argo data attributes are quantitative and need to be mapped to several intervals [8]. Quantitative inter-transaction association rules are mined from a one-dimensional database in three steps: quantitative attribute transformation, the discovery of frequent inter-transaction itemsets and salinity and temperature patterns generation.

A. Quantitative Attribute Transformation The first step is to map each quantitative attribute into its  intervals. Let },...,,{ 21 kiiiI = be the set of all items that belongs to the original database. For the sake of simplicity, it is assumed that the database only has one quantitative attribute, ij, where kj ??1 . If ij is mapped to l intervals, then the new set If of all items becomes },,...,,,...,,,...,,{ 1),()2,()1,(21 kjljjj iiiiiii + where ir, ,jr ?  is a binary attribute and ),()2,()1,( ,...,, ljjj iii are attributes that are transformed from the quantitative attribute ij.

B. Frequent Inter-transaction Itemsets Discovery Let If be the new set of all items that is defined from the  previous phase and W be a sliding window with w intervals along the dimensional attribute. We now redefine an inter-transaction M contained within W to be:  }.10,inattributeanis],[|)({ ????= wtIitWitiM f  The set of all possible extended items is then redefined as:  )}.1(),...,0(),...,1(),...,0(  ),1(),...,0(),...,1(),...,0(  ),...,1(),...,0(),1(),...,0({   ),(),()1,()1,(   ??  ??  ??=?  ++ wiiwii  wiiwii  wiiwiiI  kkjj  ljljjj  f  Furthermore, an inter-transaction k-itemset is the set fIB ??  such that there exists at least one attribute )0(ri  or  attribute .)0(),( Bi lj ?  In this step, the Apriori algorithm can be used to find frequent inter-transaction itemsets. Since the quantitative attribute transformations and inter-transactions results in large quantities of data, it takes longer to process. To solve the problem, one can employ a reduced prefix-projected itemsets method based on PrefixSpan algorithm to expedite the efficient search for the frequent itemsets. Pei et al. [7] employed a projection scheme in the PrefixSpan algorithm where customer sequences (transactions) were projected into overlapping sets called projected databases such that all the customer sequences in each set had the same prefix that corresponded to a frequent sequence (itemset). The main idea behind PrefixSpan is that, instead of projecting sequence databases by considering all the possible occurrences of frequent subsequences, the projection is based only on frequent prefixes. This holds, because any frequent subsequence can always be found by growing a frequent prefix. The reduced prefix-projected itemsets method was employed in this study to get frequent itemsets. Further details of the method can be found in [5].

C. Variation Patterns Generation The generation of inter-transaction association rules  (salinity and temperature variation patterns) is similar to the generation of classic association rules. The calculation of rule confidence is shown in Definition 4.

D. Patterns Importance Measurements This section introduces how to obtain the importance  measurements for an association rule.

Let },...,,{ 21 neeeE = be a set of n distinct salinity or temperature variations and BA ee  denotes the salinity and temperature variation pattern that both Ae  and Be  are subset of E. Ae  occurs in the spatial cluster 1C ; Be  occurs in the spatial cluster 2C . 1C  and 2C  may be different clusters or the same one.

If 1C  and 2C  are different then the following entropy-based strategy is employed which considers that the variations in either the antecedent part or the consequent part should not be uncertain and should be similar to other variations in the cluster they belong to. The difference between  1C  and 2C are also considered.

Fig. 2 shows the structure of the discovered patterns that have antecedent and consequent from different clusters. In Fig.

2, 1C  and 2C  are two clusters; Ae  belongs to 1C  and  Be  belongs to 2C . A Be e  is the discovered pattern.

Uncertainty measurement for Ae  in 1C is defined as:   =  ?= n  j jAjAA eepeepCeE  111 ),,(log),()|(  (2)     where , ),(  ),( ),(    =  = n  k kA  jA jA  eeSimi  eeSimi eep  and  ),( 1 jA eeSimi denotes the similarity between Ae  and je1 .

This measurement represents how uncertain the variations are in the cluster they belong to.

)|( 2CeE B  denotes the uncertainty for Be  in 2C .

Similarity measurement for Ae  in 1C is defined as:  ./)),(()|(  11 neeSimiCeS n  k kAA  = =  (3)  The difference between 1C  and 2C  is defined as:  ,)()(),( 22, 212121 CCCCCC SSTTST ?+?=?  (4)  where 1CT and 1CS denote the mean temperature and salinity  of 1C , respectively. 2CT and 2CS denote the mean temperature and salinity of 2C , respectively.

A rule BA ee is important if it satisfies the following conditions:  (1) ,min)|( 1 simiCeS A ?  where minsimi denotes a minimum similarity threshold.

(2) .min)|( 2 simiCeS B ?  (3) ,min)|( 1 entroCeE A ?  where minentro denotes a minimum entropy threshold.

(4) entroCeE B min)|( 2 ? .

(5) ,min),( 21, tsST CC ??  where mints denotes a minimum  threshold of mean temperature and salinity between 1C  and  2C .

If 1C  and 2C  are the same cluster then the pattern is usually unimportant. However, one exception may be if the variations in either antecedent part or consequent part are considered as a special case around the zone they belong to.

In order to measure the patterns, two neighborhoods are defined for Ae  and Be , respectively. Fig. 3 shows the structure of the discovered patterns that have antecedent and consequent from the same cluster. 1N  and 2N  are two neighbors for Ae  and Be , respectively. The uncertainty measurement for Ae  in 1N  is defined as:   =  ?= n  j jAjAA eepeepNeE  111 ),,(log),()|(  (5)  where , ),(  ),( ),(    =  = n  k kA  jA jA  eeSimi  eeSimi eep  and  ),( 1 jA eeSimi denotes the similarity between Ae  and je1 .

Accordingly, )|( 2NeE B  can be defined in the same way.

Similarity measurement for Ae  in 1N is defined as:  ./)),(()|(  11 neeSimiNeS n  k kAA  = =  (6)  A rule BA ee is important if it satisfies the following conditions:  (1) ,max)|( 1 simiNeS A ?  where maxsimi denotes a maximum similarity threshold.

(2) .max)|( 2 simiNeS B ?  (3) ,min)|( 1 entroNeE A ?  where minentro denotes a minimum entropy threshold.

(4) entroNeE B min)|( 2 ? .



IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The Argo delayed-mode data that can be downloaded from  Global Data Assembly Centers (GDACs) [2] were used in this study. The data in each Argo data file represent the salinity and temperature measurements for a single float. The salinity and temperature measurements extracted from a float are associated with the time of measurement and the location of the float. This study utilized data at 100m-depth from January 2001 to December 2006. Concentric circles were used as a reference model as they allow spatial transactions to be easily defined.

Taipei, Taiwan is the reference site and the radii for inner and outer circles were 900 km and 1800 km, respectively. Only the salinity and temperature data within the concentric circles were used together with contextual information, i.e., direction and distance relative to Taipei. Monthly means are computed and compared to the 10-year monthly mean data to derive the monthly variations. The same monthly variations are defined as a single transaction. Table I shows the market-basket type transaction set of salinity and temperature variations. Each transaction is recorded with spatial and temporal information.

Table II shows the intervals that the salinity and temperature variations are mapped to. NOR events are used to classify situations where no variations occur in a specific sub-area.

Table III shows the results of the quantitative attributes in Table 1 mapped to several intervals.

The maxspan window size is set to 6 months. In order to reduce the computational complexity, the PrefixSpan based algorithm is employed to find large inter-itemsets (the minimum support is set to 25%). Inter-transaction association rules are derived from these large inter-itemsets as the minimum confidence is set to 70%. Table IV shows part of the discovered inter-transaction association rules. For example, the rule, H1SRL(0) -> A2SRL(3), means that if salinity rose from 0.05psu to 0.15psu in the area that is in the west-south sector     near Taiwan, then salinity will rise from 0.05psu to 0.15psu in the east sector far away from Taiwan the next 3 months.

Next, the patterns with variations in both the antecedent part and the consequent part that belong to two different water masses and the ones that their variations in both antecedent part and consequent part belong to the same water mass are evaluated. Sub-zones A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2, J1, J2, K1, K2, L1 and L2 belong to Kuroshio Water (KW). Sub-zones I1 and I2 belong to Kuroshio Branch Water (KBW). Sub- zones H1 and H2 belong to South China Sea Water (SCSW). Table V lists the mean temperature and salinity data [6]. Two examples are given to illustrate the rule importance measure.

Example 1. These rules have their variations in both antecedent part and consequent as members of two different water masses.

Rule 1. If salinity rose little in H1 then salinity will rise little in A2 three months later.

Rule 2. If salinity rose little in H2 then salinity will rise little in I2 three months later.

In this experiment, the thresholds minsimi, minentro and mints are set to 0.35, 20, and 4, respectively. Table VI lists the results, which reveal that Rule 1 is an important rule. In fact, Rule 2 is well known to oceanographers. This is because interactions exist between KBW and SCSW [6].

Example 2. The rule, if salinity rose little in A1 then salinity will rise little in A2 one month later, has its variations in both antecedent part and consequent part and belong to KW.

To measure this rule the neighborhood for sub-zone A1 is defined to include B1 and L1 and the neighborhood of sub-zone A2 is defined to include B2 and L2. The thresholds maxsimi and minentro are set to 0.4 and 20, respectively. The similarity measurements, )|( 1NeS A and )|( 2NeS B , are 0.73 and 0.75, respectively. This means that the variations that occur in either antecedent part or consequent part are similar to other variations in the neighborhood they belong to. They are not special. This rule is well known, too.



V. CONCLUSIONS This study proposes a strategy where concentric circles are  used as a reference model to define spatial transactions that are mined using an improved inter-transaction association rules algorithm to discover salinity and temperature variation patterns where also time and location information are revealed.

Moreover, in order to identify which rule is important, an entropy-based measure is proposed for the evaluation of the discovered rules. The rule importance can aid experts in making better decisions. A fuzzy inference model can be used to separate valuable information from trivial data.
