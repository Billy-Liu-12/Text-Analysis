A Statistical Approach for Semantic Relation Extraction   Aurawan Imsombut

Abstract? Semantic relations are an important component of ontologies that can support many applications e.g. text mining, question answering, and information extraction.

Automatic semantic relation extraction system is a crucial tool that can reduce the bottleneck of knowledge acquisition in the ontologies construction. In this paper, we present a statistical approach for learning the semantic relations between concepts of an ontology in the agricultural domain. The semantic relations are acquired by using verbs to indicate the relations between ontology concepts. The co-occurrences of domain- verbs with their components, which are annotated the concepts, are analyzed by using several statistical methodologies.

Moreover, we expand the sets of verb expressing the same semantic relation by using the extracted patterns of concept pairs of the seed verb?s component. Our experiment has been done on a collection of Thai shallow parsed texts in the domain of agriculture. The precision and recall of the presented system is 65% and 82%, respectively.



I. INTRODUCTION NTOLOGIES are the knowledge representation that can support many applications such as text mining, question  answering, information retrieval,  and semantic web.

However, manual construction of ontologies is labor intensive and costly. And the resources of knowledge in specific domain are more available in electronic form then a number of studies for developing the automatic system of ontology learning from text become increasingly. The domain ontology consists of concepts, taxonomic and semantic relation between these concepts, and inference rules. Hence, the core subtasks of the ontology learning systems from texts are learning of concepts, learning of taxonomy and semantic relations and learning of inference rules. In order to enrich Thai ontology in the agriculture domain [1], this paper presents our approach for the learning semantic relations among ontology concepts.

The semantic relations in the ontology are very useful for supporting many applications such as question answering, information extraction, etc. For example, understanding of semantic relation ?destroy? in the agricultural domain allows the information extraction system to generate the patterns for extra d th vcting the wrecker an e ictim like:  Thus, the information extraction system can apply this pattern and the knowledge in ontology for extract the desired information. However, extracting semantic relation between two concepts is not easy since various relations among  instances of the concepts are possible and there are many terms that indicate the same semantic relation.

The methodology is proposed based on the assumption that verbs indicate semantic relations between concepts. The proposed model extracts the semantic relations by discovering domain verbs with the statistical measure. Next, the components of verbs are discovered and identified the semantic class by using the taxonomic relation in ontology in order to generalize the terms. The appropriated semantic relations are selected by applying several statistical techniques to evaluate the correlations. Finally, we expand the set of verbs that express the semantic relations by using the pattern of subject-object to discover the other verbs that are frequent co-occurring. We evaluated the system by using Thai corpora and ontology [1] in the domain of agriculture.

In the next section we describe related works. In section 3, we present the proposed methodology for extracting of the semantic relations.  In section 4, we discuss the experimental result and the evaluation of the system?s output. Finally, section 5 summarizes the paper and the directions of future work.



II. RELATED WORKS A number of proposals are proposed for learning semantic relation of ontologies from unstructured text. The Asium system [2] learns semantic knowledge by using clustering features in the form of sub-categorization frames of verbs but it needs an expert to label each cluster node and each relationship name. The next approach is the co-occurrence of lexical approach. Maedche and Staab [3] proposed an algorithm based on statistical techniques and association rules of data mining technology for detecting relevant relationships between ontological concepts. DODDLE [4] extracts the non-taxonomic relationships by analyzing the co-occurrence of lexical, based on word space. The relation of each concept pair is considered by the similarity between their vectors in word space. Kavalec and Svatek [5] proposed the technique for relation labeling by selecting verbs frequently occurring in the context with each concept association. RelExt system [6] extracts relevant verbs and their grammatical arguments (i.e. terms) from a domain- specific text collection and computing corresponding relations through a combination of linguistic and statistical processing. Next, a plug-in (OntoLT) for Prot?g? [7] provides an environment for the integration of linguistic analysis and user defined mapping rules that map linguistic entities in annotated text collections to concept and attribute.

For this paper, the proposed method are very close to the technique of the Asium system [2], but the Asium system  O    2009 Eighth International Symposium on Natural Language Processing    processes on the fully parsed text and verb sub- categorization for clustering the concepts. Meanwhile, this study works on shallow parsed text and learns for semantic relations.



III. METHODOLOGY FOR AUTOMATIC EXTRACTING SEMANTIC RELATION  The automatic semantic relation extraction system is composed of five main processes: Pre-Processing, Domain- Verb Extraction, Verb Argument Extraction, Concept Identification, Correlation Analysis, and Verb Expanding as shown in Fig 1.

Fig. 1. Architecture for extracting semantic relation  3.1 Pre-Processing Word segmentation: Thai texts are a single stream of  characters because there are no delimiters (blank space) to show word boundaries, similarly as many other Asian languages. Then, word segmentation is a crucial module for pre-processing the texts.

POS tagging: POS tagging is one of the necessary modules for annotating part-of-speech to each word in the documents. In this work, we apply the system from [8] for identifying a term unit and its syntactic category.

NPs Chunking: After morphological analysis process,  the documents are chunked into phrases to identify shallow Noun Phrase (NP) boundaries within a sentence. The used NP parser [9] relies on NP rules, word formation rules, and lexical data. In this work, we consider only NPs corresponding to 4 NP?s grammatical rules i.e.

NP1 = (ncn|nct+ncn|npn) + NP?, NPs are composed of many nouns e.g. [/chuea/(pathogen):ncn /wairat/(virus):ncn] (virus pathogen),  NP2 = NP1 + adj, NPs are composed of noun phrase and adjective e.g. [/kulap/(rose):ncn  /daeng/(red):adj] (red rose),  NP3 = NP + vi|(vt+NP), NPs are composed of noun phrase and verb phrase e.g. [/a-ngun/(grape):ncn /tham/(produce):vi /wai/(vine):ncn]  (vine grape)  NP4 = NP + prep + NP, NPs contain preposition e.g.

[/sinkha/(product):ncn  /caak/(from):prep  /tangprathet/ (foreign country):ncn] (product from foreign country).

Even through, NPs can be generated with many grammatical rules more than the previous shown rules, but according to some rules entire NPs could not be an ontological term such as Nominal NPs. These NPs are constructed from verb phrase by using some prefixes. For example, [/kan/(-ing):pref  /hai/(give):vt /nam/(water):ncn] (watering). We analyze that the concepts formed with this pattern cannot act as the agent or object of the transitive verb. Moreover, the NPs pattern of [ncn+conj+ncn] and [ncn+det] is not considered in this work because it contains two units of ontological term, where conj is conjunction and det is determiner. For example, [/phak/(vegetable): ncn /lae/(and):conj /phonlamai/(fruit): ncn] (vegetable and fruit).

The selected ontological terms should be separated into two terms, i.e. /phak/(vegetable) and /phonlamai/(fruit).

EDU Segmentation: After shallow parsing, the texts are segmented to Elementary Discourse Unit (EDU) in order to analyze the co-occurrence of verb and its components. The EDU is a minimal discourse unit that is a clause or clause- like unit. In Thai, there are no symbols to express the sentence boundary like full stop in English. Then, in this work we consider the boundary for analyze the co- occurrence of terms as an EDU produced by the methodology that is proposed from Chareonsuk et al. [10].

3.2 Domain-Verb Extraction For extracting semantic relation, we use a verb to express  the relation between concepts that they are frequent co- occurrence. In this process, the system will extract the verbs that are significant for the interested domain by using tf/idf (term frequency?inverse document frequency) [11], the statistical technique that often used for weighting the term in information retrieval and text mining. This tf/idf value is a statistical measure used to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a corpus. In this study, we use tf/idf technique for analyzing frequency of terms usage in the interested domain comparing with other domains in order to identify the significant of term in an interested domain.

Corpus  Domain-Verb Extraction  Verb Argument Extraction  Ontology Enrichm t with Semantic Relation  en  Concept Identification  Pre-Processing  Correlation Analysis  Verb Expanding     / ( , ) ( , )* (  ( ) log ( )  tf idf d w tf d w idf w  Nidf w df w  )  Where, tf(d,w) is the frequency of verb w in domain d, and idf(w) is the inverse frequency of documents that  contain verb w.

The verbs that have the high value of tf/idf will be  assigned as the domain verb. In our experiment, the examples of extracted verb in the domain of agricultural are destroy, trim, and crop.

3.3 Verb Argument Extraction In this process, the subject and object arguments of the  domain verbs are extracted. First, the system will anchor the EDUs contained the domain verbs. Moreover, the noun phrases in NP3 pattern (NP + vt + NP) are also anchored since they contain the verb and this NP?s pattern likes a sentence that contains subject, verb, and object. Next, the system will identify the subject and object of the domain verb as the domain and range of the semantic relation indicated by the verb. We execute this process by using some heuristic rules since we use only shallow parsed text.

Since, Thai parser to produce the syntactic information is very challenging to obtain. Hence, we propose to solve this problem by using the following heuristic rules to identify the subject and object of the domain verbs.

- Subjects are NPs that occurs before verb.

- Object is an adjacent NP that occurs after verb.

In this work, we assume that all NPs that occur before verb are the subject of the sentence because in Thai the subject of the sentence can occur in any place of the sentence while the object is the NP that often occurs after verb, immediately. For example,  (1) [ /npn]/NP /vt [ /ncn [ /ncn ]/NP ]/NP [Aphid/npn]/NP destroys/vt [stem/ncn  of/prep [rice/ncn]/NP]/NP  (2) [[ /ncn]/NP [ /pref2 /vt [ /ncn]/NP ]/NP ]/NP /prev /vt  /ncn /prep [ /ncn /ncn]/NP [[farmer/ncn]/NP [who/pref2 plants/vt  [orchid/ncn]/NP ]/NP ]/NP should/prev harvest/vt [flower/ncn]/NP in/prep the/art [morning/ncn]/NP.

(3) /prep [ /ncn [ /ncn /ncn]/NP ]/NP  [ /ncn]/NP /prev /vt [ /ncn /vt / ncn]/NP /vt /adv /vpost In/prep [rainy/adj season/ncn]/NP,  [farmer/ncn]/NP should/prev spray/vt [pesticide/ncn]/NP many_times/adv (4) [  [Pesticide/ncn]/NP such_as/conjncl [Atabron/npn]/NP can/prev eliminate/vt [Beet_Armyworm/npn]/NP.

In example (1), the EDU contain only one NP before and after verb then it is easy for the system to extract the co- occurrence element as:  Aphid-destroy-Stem_of_rice  In example (2) and (3), the subject of the sentence is the ?farmer? but in example (2) this NP stands far away from the verb while in example (3) it adjoins with the verb. In example (4), both NPs before verb can be the subject of the sentence because they can be the agent of the verb. We solve this problem by allowing all NPs before verb are the subject of verb and using statistical measurements in the next process to select the good subject as the domain of the semantic relation.

Moreover, in this process we have the rules to prune some EDUs i.e., we do not consider the verbs that follow the Relative pronoun because it is the modifier of the subject, does not be a predicate of the subject. For instance,  (5) [ /ncn ]/NP /prel /vt /prep [ /ncn /npn]/NP ? [rose/ncn ]/NP that/prel plant/vt in/prep  [Thailand/npn]/NP ? 3.4 Concept Identification  After verb argument extraction process, the verb?s components are identified the semantics by using the taxonomic relations from existing agricultural ontology [1] in order to get high frequency co-occurrence and propose the appropriated relations.

According to the existing ontology, we used the Thai ontology in domain of agriculture that constructed from AGROVOC thesaurus [12], Thai Plant name dictionary [13] and agricultural corpus. It contains about 59,971 concepts in the topic of plant, animal, chemical, disease and food as shown in Fig 2.

/ncn]/NP /conjncl [ /ncn]/NP /prev /vt [ /ncn]/NP /vpost  Fig 2. The excerpted ontology in the domain of agriculture  In this process, the component terms will be annotated the concept by using the top hypernym from the ontology and inference method. For example, the concept of Ahpid is  Root  Animal Crop  Insect Horticulture  Grasshopper  Brown Plant Hopper  Vegetable  Patanga  IS-A Relation  Field crop  Maize  Cereal crop  Rice  Sucking insect  Aphid  Fruit  stem leaf  Part-of Relation Crop_structure     animal and the Rice_leaves is Plant Structure concept. Thus, the analyzed element will be: Animal-destroy-Crop_structures  3.5 Correlation Analysis In this process, the previous extracted elements, concept-  verb-concept, are analyzed the co-occurrence of the verb and the concept by using some statistical methods. We explore three alternatives, Mutual Information (MI) [14], log- likelihood ratio (LL) [15], and Chi-square testing ( 2). The mutual information is the measurement in probability theory and information theory. It is a quantity that measures the mutual dependence of the two variables. The Log Likelihood Ratio is a ?goodness of fit? statistics that was a way to determine if the words in an observed boundary come from a sample that is independently distributed; meaning they occur together by chance. By experimenting with Thai agriculture document, we found that Chi-square has the highest precision. Chi-square is based on hypothesis testing. It measures the divergence of the observed and expected data.

Chi-square can be defined as follows:  ))()()(( )( 22  dcdbcaba bcadN  Where a represents the frequency of the verb occurring in the same sentence with the concept-pair or the verb?s component. The value b (respectively c) is the number of occurrences of verb (respectively the concept-pair) in the corpus for sentences not containing the concept-pair (respectively verb). The value d indicates the number of sentences that does not contain neither verb nor concept- pair. The total number of sentences in the corpus is represented by N.

The higher Chi-square value shows the higher correlation of the verb and its components. The elements that have the higher correlation value than the threshold are selected for generat in and ra e e semantic relation. For instan  e as doma ng  of th ce,  3.6 Verb Expanding Once we have extracted the set of the concept pair with  high collocation, we use them to gather the set of verbs occurring between this set of the concept pair in order to expand the set verb. The system uses the patterns of concept pair to discover the sentence containing these patterns. The exam as t lowing: ple pattern is shown he fol  After the system gather the occurring of patterns, the extracted sentence will be analyzed the correlation with the statistical method as described in the previous process in order to select only the important verbs.



IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The measurement of the system?s performance was based  on test cases in the domain of agriculture. We computed the precision, recall, and F-measure, by comparing the outputs  of the system with the results produced by the experts of agriculture. Precision (p) gives the number of extracted correct results divided by the number of total extracted results, while recall (r) shows the number of extracted correct results divided by the number of total correct results, and F-measure (F) is the harmonic mean of precision (p) and recall (r), i.e., 2pr/(p+r).

By experimenting with a corpus of about 100,000 words from 350 documents about plant, the system is able to extract about 65 transitive verbs in agricultural domain comparing with the occurring of these verbs in the politic, technology and sport documents. Table 1 shows top-10 high frequency verbs in the domain of agriculture. From these terms, they show that some of these verbs have similar meaning e.g. plant and grow. Then, we group these verbs that have the same concepts and identify the domain and range of these relations by move on the following processes i.e. extracting these verb?s components, identifying the  components? concept, analyzing the correlation and expanding the set of verb.

Table 2 show the example of semantic relations with high correlation. The experimental result shows that the system can extract 22 semantic relations groups. The maximum number of verb members in a group is 12 and there is only one member in the minimum size group. The example group of semantic relation that contains the most members is {  TABLE I TOP-10 HIGH FREQUENCY VERBS IN THE DOMAIN OF AGRICULTURE  Verb tf/idf value 930.97  (plant) 216.78  (grow) 139.19  (eliminate) 129.24  (harvest) 102.50  (suck) 77.79  (destroy) 63.62  (spray) 54.58  (transform) 35.17  (resist) 35.17  (strew)  (plant),  (grow),  (harvest),  (engraft), (engraft),  (graft), ?}.

TABLE II SEMANTIC RELATIONS WITH HIGH CORRELATION  Domain Verb Indicates Relation  By evaluating with the experts, the precision, recall and F- measure of the system are 0.65, 0.82 and 0.79, respectively.

The important cause of error is that some verbs usually occur with the same component concepts that do not the correct subject of the verbs. Thus, this makes the high correlation and the system extracted incorrect domain.

Range Animal Crop_structure(destroy), (suck), (eat), ? Human Crop (plant), (grow),  (harvest),? Human Crop_structure(strew), (cut), (maintain), ? Human Animal (eliminate), (kill), (destroy), ? Crop  (resist), (endure) Disease     However, this is the normal problem that can occur when we do not work with the syntactic parsed text.



V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS We presented a study on extracting semantic relations  from text in the domain of agriculture. Our proposed methodology is based on a co-occurrence between verb and its arguments. In order to get high frequency co-occurrence and propose the appropriated relations, we apply the taxonomic relation in the agricultural ontology to identify the semantic meaning of terms. To select appropriated relations, the statistical measurements are used for analyzing the correlation. To generalize the semantic relation, we discover the occurring of subject-object pair and other verbs in the document and the system can expand the set of verb.

The results of ontological analysis of the acquired relations are positive and promising though the experiment is preliminary. The contribution of the proposed methodology is that the system is based on only chunk parsed text but the vital limitation of our approach is that the terms are annotated with the top concept meaning then all generated relations are the relation at the top level. This caused some semantic relations are very general and they are not benefit when applying in the application. The future work is to identify the semantic relations in the appropriate level.
