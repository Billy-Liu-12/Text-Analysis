I. INTRODUCTION  Data mining is a key member in the Business Intelligence (BI) product family, together with Online Analytical Processing (OLAP), enterprise reporting and ETL [1].

Data mining is about analyzing data and finding hidden patterns using automatic or semiautomatic means. During the past decade, large volumes of data have been accumulated and stored in databases. Much of this data comes from business software, such as financial applications, Enterprise Resource Management (ERP), Customer Relationship Management (CRM), and Web logs. The result of this data collection is that organizations have become data-rich and knowledge-poor. The collections of data have become so vast and are increasing so rapidly in size that the practical use of these stores of data has become limited. The main purpose of data mining is to extract patterns from the data at hand, increase its intrinsic value and transfer the data to knowledge [2].



II. DATA MINING TASKS  Data mining can be used to solve hundreds of business problems. Based on the nature of these problems, we can group them into the following data mining tasks.

A. Classification  Classification is one of the most popular data mining tasks.

Business problems like churn analysis, risk management and ad targeting usually involve classification [3].

Classification refers to assigning cases into categories based on a predictable attribute. Each case contains a set of attributes, one of which is the class attribute (predictable  attribute). The task requires finding a model that describes the class attribute as a function of input attributes. In the College Plans dataset previously described, the class is the College Plans attribute with two states: Yes and No. To train a classification model, you need to know the class value of input cases in the training dataset, which are usually the historical data. Data mining algorithms that require a target to learn against are considered supervised algorithms.

Typical classification algorithms include decision trees, neural network, and Na?ve Bayes.

B. Clustering  Clustering is also called segmentation. It is used to identify natural groupings of cases based on a set of attributes. Cases within the same group have more or less similar attribute values.

For example, a simple customer dataset contains two attributes: age and income. The clustering algorithm groups the dataset into three segments based on these two attributes.

Cluster 1 contains the younger population with a low income.

Cluster 2 contains middle-aged customers with higher incomes.

Cluster 3 is a group of senior individuals with a relatively low income.

Clustering is an unsupervised data mining task. No single attribute is used to guide the training process. All input attributes are treated equally. Most clustering algorithms build the model through a number of iterations and stop when the model converges, that is, when the boundaries of these segments are stabilized.

C. Association  Association is another popular data mining task.

Association is also called market basket analysis. A typical association business problem is to analyze a sales transaction table and identify those products often sold in the same shopping basket. The common usage of association is to identify common sets of items and rules for the purpose of cross-selling [4].

In terms of association, each product, or more generally, each attribute/value pair is considered an item. The association task has two goals: to find frequent item sets and to find association rules.

Most association type algorithms find frequent item sets by scanning the dataset multiple times. The frequency threshold is defined by the user before processing the model. For example, support = 2% means that the model analyzes only items that appear in at least 2% of shopping carts. A frequent item set may look like {Product = ?Pepsi?, Product = ?Chips?, Product = ?Juice?}. Each item set has a size, which is the number of items that it contains. The size of this particular item set is 3.

Apart from identifying frequent item sets based on support, most association type algorithms also find rules. An association rule has the form A, B => C with a probability, where A, B, C are all frequent item sets. The probability is also referred to as the confidence in data mining literature. The probability is a threshold value that the user needs to specify before training an association model. For example, the following is a typical rule: Product = ?Pepsi?, Product = ?Chips? => Product = ?Juice? with an 80% probability. The interpretation of this rule is straightforward. If a customer buys Pepsi and chips, there is an 80% chance that he or she may also buy juice. In the product association patterns, each node in the figure represents a product, each edge represents the relationship. The direction of the edge represents the direction of the prediction. For example, the edge from Milk to Cheese indicates that those who purchase milk might also purchase cheese.

D. Regression  The regression task is similar to classification. The main difference is that the predictable attribute is a continuous number. Regression techniques have been widely studied for centuries in the field of statistics. Linear regression and logistic regression are the most popular regression methods. Other regression techniques include regression trees and neural networks.

Regression tasks can solve many business problems. For example, they can be used to predict coupon redemption rates based on the face value, distribution method, and distribution volume, or to predict wind velocities based on temperature, air pressure, and humidity.

E. Forecasting  Forecasting is yet another important data mining task. What will the stock value of MSFT be tomorrow? What will the sales amount of Pepsi be next month? Forecasting can help to answer these questions. It usually takes as an input time series dataset, for example a sequence of numbers with an attribute representing time. The time series data typically contains adjacent observations, which are order-dependant. Forecasting techniques deal with general trends, periodicity, and noisy noise filtering. The most popular time series technique is ARIMA, which stands for Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average model.

F. Sequence Analysis  Sequence analysis is used to find patterns in a discrete series. A sequence is composed of a series of discrete values (or states). For example, a DNA sequence is a long series composed of four different states: A, G, C, and T.A Web click sequence contains a series of URLs. Customer purchases can  also be modeled as sequence data. For example, a customer first buys a computer, then speakers, and finally a Webcam.

Both sequence and time series data contain adjacent observations that are dependant. The difference is that the sequence series contains discrete states, while the time series contains continuous numbers.

Sequence and association data are similar in the sense that each individual case contains a set of items or states. The difference between sequence and association models is that sequence models analyze the state transitions, while the association model considers each item in a shopping cart to be equal and independent. With the sequence model, buying a computer before buying Cheese Wine Milk Cake Beer Coke Pepsi Juice Beef Donut speakers is a different sequence than buying speakers before a computer. With an association algorithm, these are considered to be the same item set.

In web click sequences, each node is a URL category. Each line has a direction, representing a transition between two URLs. Each transition is associated with a weight, representing the probability of the transition between one URL and the other.

Sequence analysis is a relatively new data mining task. It is becoming more important mainly due to two types of applications: Web log analysis and DNA analysis. There are several different sequence techniques available today such as Markov chains. Researchers are actively exploring new algorithms in this field. The state transitions among a set of URL categories are based on Web click data.

G. Deviation Analysis  Deviation analysis is for finding those rare cases that behave very differently from others. It is also called outlier detection, which refers to the detection of significant changes from previously observed behavior. Deviation analysis can be used in many applications. The most common one is credit card fraud detection. To identify abnormal cases from millions of transactions is a very challenging task. Other applications include network intrusion detection, manufacture error analysis, and so on. [5]  There is no standard technique for deviation analysis. It is still an actively researched topic. Usually analysts employ some modified versions of decision trees, clustering, or neural network algorithms for this task. In order to generate significant rules, analysts need to over sample the anomaly cases in the training dataset.



III. DATA MINING TECHNIQUES  Although data mining as a term is relatively new, most data mining techniques have existed for years. If we look at the roots of those popular data mining algorithms, we find that they are mainly derived from three fields: statistics, machine learning, and database.

Most of data mining tasks listed in the previous section have been addressed in the statistics community. A number of data mining algorithms, including regression, time series, and decision trees, were invented by statisticians.

Regression techniques have existed for centuries. Time series algorithms have been studied for decades. The decision tree algorithm is one of the more recent techniques, dating from the mid-1980s.

Data mining focuses on automatic or semiautomatic pattern discovery. Several machine learning algorithms have been applied to data mining. Neural networks are one of these techniques and are excellent for classification and regression, especially when the attribute relationships are nonlinear. The genetic algorithm is yet another machine learning technique. It simulates the natural evolution process by working with a set of candidates and a survival (fitness) function. The survival function repeatedly selects the most suitable candidates for the next generation. Genetic algorithms can be used for classification and clustering tasks. They can also be used in conjunction with other algorithms, for instance, helping a neural network to find the best set of weights among neurons.

A database is the third technical source for data mining.

Traditional statistics assumes that all the data can be loaded into memory for statistical analysis.

Unfortunately, this is not always the case in the modern world. Database experts know how to handle large amounts of data that do not fit in memory, for example, finding association rules in a fact table containing millions of sales transactions. As a matter of fact, the most efficient association algorithms come from the database research community. There are also a few scalable versions of classification and clustering algorithms that use database techniques, including the Microsoft Clustering algorithm.



IV. SQL SERVER 2005 DATA MINING ALGORITHMS  SQL Server 2005 provides us with seven data mining algorithms. Most of these algorithms perform several different tasks. This section provides a brief explanation of each to give you some background information. More important is the knowledge of what each can be used to accomplish.

A. Microsoft Decision Trees  The Microsoft Decision Trees algorithm is one of the easiest algorithms to understand because it creates a tree structure during its training process. The tree structure is then used to provide predictions and analysis.

1) Function The Microsoft Decision Trees algorithm shows a decision  tree. In this tree, we are analyzing the relationship between various product attributes and likelihood to be a high seller.

Each new attribute the algorithm processes adds a new branch to the tree. We have a binary tree. But, using an attribute with more than two values, it is possible to have a fork with more than two branches?a N-ary tree, if you like the lingo.

As each node in the tree is created, the attribute we will be predicting is examined in the training data set.

2) Tasks The main purpose of the Microsoft Decision Trees  algorithm is Classification. It can also be used for Regression and Association.

B. Microsoft Na?ve Bayes  Microsoft's SQL Product Manager, Donald Farmer, claims because there is a Na?ve Bayes algorithm, there must be a "deeply cynical" Bayes algorithm out there somewhere in data mining land. I guess it is needed to bring balance to data mining's version of the "force." We will try not to be too Na?ve as we explore the benefits and shortcomings of this algorithm.

1) Function The Na?ve Bayes algorithm looks at each attribute of the  entity in question and determines how that attribute, on its own, affects the attribute we are looking to predict. Na?ve Bayes algorithm can be used to predict whether a customer is a good credit risk. One by one, the Na?ve Bayes algorithm takes a single attribute of a customer, size of company, annual revenue, and so forth and looks at the training data to determine its effect on credit risk.

What the Na?ve Bayes algorithm does not tell us is what the results might be if we consider more than one attribute at a time.

2) Tasks The Na?ve Bayes algorithm can only be used for  Classification.

C. Microsoft Clustering  The Microsoft Clustering algorithm builds clusters of entities as it processes the training data set.

1) Function Once the clusters are created, the algorithm analyzes the  makeup of each cluster. It looks at the values of each attribute for the entities in the cluster.

By entering the attribute value we want, we can have the clusters color-coded according to the concentration of our desired value.

For example, say we are trying to determine the distinguishing characteristics of customers who are likely to go to the competition in the next two months. We create our clusters of customers from the training data. Next, we ask the Business Intelligence Development Studio to show us the concentration of customers from the training data set whose did leave within two months. The darker the cluster, the more departed customers it contains.

Finally, we can examine what attributes most distinguish the high-concentration clusters from the others.

2) Tasks The main purpose of the Microsoft Clustering algorithm is  Segmentation.

It can also be used for regression and classification.

D. Microsoft Association  The Microsoft Association algorithm is used for association. To use this algorithm, we must have entities that are grouped into sets within our data.

1) Function     The Microsoft Association algorithm creates its own sets of entities, and then determines how often those sets occur in the test data set. In this set, we are looking at groupings of products purchased together in a single purchase transaction.

This algorithm looks at how many times a purchase included the item in each set. Once the sets are created, the algorithm creates membership rules based on the result.

2) Tasks The Microsoft Association algorithm can only be used for  Association.

E. Microsoft Sequence Clustering  The Microsoft Sequence Clustering algorithm is a new algorithm developed by Microsoft Research. The Microsoft Sequence Clustering algorithm is primarily used for sequence analysis, but it has other uses as well.

1) Function The Microsoft Sequence Clustering algorithm examines the  test data set to identify transitions from one state to another.

The test data set contains data, such as a web log, showing navigation from one page to another, or perhaps routing and approval data, showing the path taken to approve each request.

The algorithm uses the test data set to determine, as a ratio, how many times each of the possible paths is taken.

2) Tasks The main purpose of the Microsoft Sequence Clustering  algorithm is Sequence Analysis Segmentation. It can also be used for Regression and Classification.

F. Microsoft Time Series  The Microsoft Time Series algorithm is used for analyzing and predicting time-dependent data. It makes use of a structure called an auto regression tree, developed by Microsoft.

1) Function The Microsoft Time Series algorithm starts with time-  related data in the test data set. With something as complex as predicting the future, you can understand that a single formula for each product is probably not going to do the trick. This is where the auto regression tree comes into play. The auto regression tree allows the algorithm to set up conditions for choosing between multiple formulas for making a prediction.

Each node in the auto regression tree has its own formula for making a prediction. We don't need to know how to create auto regression trees or the formulas they contain. All we need to know is how to use them.

2) Tasks The Microsoft Time Series algorithm can only be used for  Regression.

G. Microsoft Neural Network  Neural networks model the way human neurons function.

Microsoft has created the Microsoft Neural Network algorithm, so we can use neural networks for such mundane activities as predicting product sales.

1) Function The Microsoft Neural Network algorithm creates a web of  nodes that connect inputs derived from attribute values to a final output. Each node contains two functions. The combination function determines how to combine the inputs coming into the node. Certain inputs might get more weight than others when it comes to affecting the output from this node. The second function in each node is the activation function. The activation function takes input from the combination function and comes up with the output from this node to be sent to the next node in the network.

2) Tasks The main purpose of the Microsoft Neural Network  algorithm is Classification and Regression.
