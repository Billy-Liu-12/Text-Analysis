Empirical Analysis of Different Hierarchical

Abstract?Currently the increasing prevalence of multi-  homing and traffic engineering leads to an explosive growth of  the global routing table. It is well known that hierarchical  addressing could improve the routing scalability. Hence, some  proposals exploring the routing architecture for future Internet  reuse the hierarchical addressing for the locator assignment.

However, this may result in some ASes assigned too many  prefixes which would consequently make hosts, routers, Internet  Service Providers and Domain Name System faced with big  challenges. By modeling the Internet AS-level topology using a  hierarchical graph, we define the  processes of prefix assignment  and routing advertisement in different hierarchical addressing  deployment ways. Then, we quantify the impact of these  deployments on the prefix assignment and the routing scalability  based on the real routing data. we find that when the deploying  position gets lower, the prefix amount of arbitrary AS is getting  smaller, while the size of the global Forwarding Information Base  is monotonically increasing. Comparing with the actual  Internet?s data, suitable deployment ways for hierarchical  addressing are obtained. With these deployment ways, the  excessive prefix problem is solved and the size of the global  Forwarding Information Base could be reduced into 56% or even  32% of the one in current Internet.

I.  INTRODUCTION  It is fairly well known that hierarchical addressing (HA) is an important component for the scalability of Internet routing system. However, because of the increasing prevalence of multi-homing and traffic engineering at a finer granularity, HA is no longer deployed all over the Internet [1]. It leads to an explosive growth of the global routing table. In the last decade, the global routing table has increased from 150,000 to 430,000 entries [2]. Fortunately, some research activities have been already going on, exploring a scalable routing solution for Internet [3-6]. These solutions share a common point that they all use hierarchical addressing as the locator (address) assignment solution to guarantee the routing scalability.

Currently, HA has two deployment ways: global deployment and stub network deployment. In terms of scalability, global deployment performs better than stub network deployment [7].

However, globally deploying HA may introduce the excessive prefix problem [3,7,8]. We estimate the number of  prefixes per AS by simulating the global deployment of HA with Internet AS-level topology inferred from the routing data collected by Route View Project in January 2011 [9]. Only 18% ASes receive less than 10 prefixes. About 62.5% ASes are assigned more than 10,000 prefixes. Even worse, more than 11.6% of ASes own more than 1,000,000 prefixes, and more than 85% of these ASes are stub ASes. Firstly, how to manage so many prefixes and assign them to hosts and routers for ASes is still an open issue. Secondly, routers and hosts may own a mass of addresses which could result in some problems, such as source and destination address selection, egress router selection and session survivability. Thirdly, it could cause knotty problems for mapping system (e.g. Domain Name System (DNS)). Since one name may be mapped to numerous addresses, too many addresses may stress DNS by increasing memory requirements, delaying name resolution and consuming more network capacity. For instance, if a host has 10,000 IPv6 addresses, it may need 10,000 AAAA resource records (RRs) in DNS which could cost at least 200M memory in DNS, because one RR only records one IPv6 address [10].

Moreover, since there is a practical limit of 512 bytes for DNS replies [11], one DNS resolution may include 400 DNS replies which may delay name resolution and consume at least 200M of network capacity approximately. In addition, although HA?s global deployment solves the scalability of Default Free Zone (DFZ), it may enlarge some ASes? routing tables. For example, certain AS has ten customers or peers each of which owns 10,000 prefixes. This AS has to maintain at least 100,000 routing entries. It may be a challenge for smaller ISPs, which is shown and discussed in the following evaluation result.

Internet AS-level topology could be modeled as a hierarchical graph. We believe that the lower position (e.g. the leaf nodes) HA deploy with, the less prefixes ASes may be assigned. Although it is proved, the mathematic derivation is not shown in this paper for lack of space. It is also verified in our evaluation results. Thus, to address the excessive prefix problem, HA could be deployed starting with a lower level. But, does this solution have any adverse effect on the scalability of Internet routing system? If it does, is there a better deployment way to solve both the excessive prefix problem and the routing scalability issue? These questions are addressed in this paper.

Besides the hierarchical way, some non-topology-based addressing and routing mechanisms [12-14] are also proposed recently. Quantifying the impact of different HA deployment  2013 19th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications (APCC), Bali - Indonesia     ways on the prefix assignment and the routing scalability, may answer some considerations in designing addressing and routing architecture for future Internet.

The main contributions of this paper include the following folds:  (1) We define the model of prefix assignment and routing advertisement in different HA deployment methods and  the calculation of the prefix amount and routing table size  that arbitrary AS owns.

(2) We simulate the processes of prefix assignment and routing advertisement under scenarios of different  deployment ways based on the real Internet AS-level  topology.

(3) Moreover, we also measure the actual distributions of prefix amount and routing table size in today?s Internet.

(4) Comparing with the actual Internet?s data, we analyze the impact of different deployment ways on the prefix  amounts and routing table sizes and find suitable ways to  deploy HA.



II. RELATED WORKS  HA is originated from John M. McQuillan?s research [15].

The prefix aggregation enables contiguous IP addresses or prefixes to be aggregated into one prefix. This could reduce the routing cost on both data plane (e.g. the routing table size) and control plane (e.g. BGP updates). However, the loss is the possible increase of the average path length for the message traffic [16]. Leonard Kleinrock and Farouk Kamoun are the first to evaluate performance of the HA for large networks [17].

They focused on the tradeoff between the routing table size and network path length. Yinfang Zhuang et al. provided an indication of the efficiency of hierarchical addressing at the inter-domain level in today?s Internet  [18].

The excessive prefix problem in HA has been already discussed. Yang Song et al. pointed out that it was possible that some ASes would inherit a large number of prefixes, and all these prefixes would show up in their own routing tables and routing tables of other ASes who were peer with these ASes [7].

In order to solve this problem, Bruno Quoitin et al. limited the number of prefixes delegated to the customer domains to 2 or 5.

In addition, they also proposed another solution for the problem: each of the transit domains was allocated a globally- advertised prefix, (e.g. provider-independent (PI) prefix), and non-transit networks were delegated prefixes from their providers [8].

In Internet, the routing scalability issue is not new either.

From 1988 to April 1994, the routing table size grew at an exponential rate. This crisis was come through by the introduction of Classless InterDomain Routing (CIDR).

However, from late 1998, CIDR has been unable to keep pace with the growth of the Internet and the routing table size shows the sign of exponential growth again [19]. This challenge raises great research interest on the growth of BGP routing table size [1, 20, 21] and the solutions to the scalability problem of Internet routing [22]. In addition, some research efforts aim to characterize how much improvement these proposals could achieve. Dong Ping et al. evaluated the performance of the  isolation of core networks from edge networks on the achievement in the reduction of the global routing table size [23]. Yangyang Wang et al. quantified the impact of different core-edge separation positions on the routing scalability [24].

As far as we are aware, ours is the first attempt to quantify the impact of different HA deployment ways on ASes' prefixes and routing table sizes seeking for the solutions to both the routing scalability issue and the excessive prefix problem.



III. HIERARCHICAL ADDRESSING AND INTER-DOMAIN ROUTING IN INTERNET  In this section, hierarchical addressing and inter-domain routing are introduced briefly. Nowadays, Internet is composed of transit ASes and stub ASes. There are mainly three commercial contractual relationships between ASes, including provider-customer (P2C or C2P) relationship, peer-peer relationship (P2P), and sibling-sibling (S2S) relationship. Since S2S relationship is few and its inference is incomplete, it is ignored in our analysis [24].

In the global deployment of HA, the top-tier ASes which compose the Internet core, are assigned prefixes from Regional Internet Registries (RIRs). Then, they assign a fraction of each of their prefixes to their customer ASes. These customers excepting the stub ASes assign their customers one sub-prefix from each of those prefixes they inherit. This process recurs ending with the stub ASes, because they have no customers.

However, in the stub network deployment, only stub ASes inherit prefixes from their providers, while other transit ASes are allocated one or several PI prefixes.

Because advertisement policies determine which address blocks appear in the routing table, it is necessary to introduce these rules [25]:  ? Exporting to a provider: an AS can advertise to its providers its routes and routes of its customers, but usually not routes of its providers or peers.

? Exporting to a customer: an AS can export its routes and routes of its customers, as well as routes of its providers and peers.

? Exporting to a peer: an AS can advertise to its peers its routes and routes of its customers, but usually not routes of its providers or peers.



IV. COMPUTING PREFIX AMOUNT AND ROUTING TABLE SIZE  For the excessive prefix problem, we believe that the deployment of HA starting with a lower position of Internet's topology may be the solution. However, whether it has any adverse effect on the routing scalability is worried. The impact of these HA deployment ways on AS?s prefix amount and routing table size is analyzed in the following.

Based on the provider-customer relationship, Internet AS- level topology could be characterized as a hierarchical graph which is decomposed into several levels. Different HA deployment ways in this paper refer to the deployments starting with different levels. However, Internet AS-level topology is not strictly hierarchical practically [26]. There are cross-layer P2C AS relationships. For better understanding of the  2013 19th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications (APCC), Bali - Indonesia     theoretical discussion in this section, we exclude these cross- layer edges, assuming that the AS graph has a strictly hierarchical structure. In the evaluation section, these cross- layer P2C edges are included.

We model the Internet AS-level topology as a directed  graph ( , )G V E? in which node set V refers to ASes and the  edge set E represents the business relationships between ASes.

The directed edge defines a P2C relationship, which is oriented from a AS to one of its customer ASes. The undirected edge defines a P2P relationship. H denotes the depth of the hierarchy.

The top-tier ASes are located at the 0  th level. A customer  locates at a lower level in the hierarchy than its provider(s).

ASh,j denotes the j  th AS locating at the h  th level. The character  ?j? in ASh,j just distinguishes ASes in the same level without special meaning. The amount of ASh,j?s prefixes and routing table entries are defined as PRh,j and RTh,j respectively. The set of ASh,j?s providers, customers and peers are denoted as Pro(ASh,j), Cst(ASh,j) and Per(ASh,j). Advert(ASh,j, ASp,q) defines the amount of the routes that ASp,q exports to ASh,j. Ci denotes the scenario that HA deployment starts with ASes at the i  th   level. For instance, C0 refers to the global deployment of HA.

In Ci , every AS at the level above i  th level including the ASes  at i th level, is assigned N PI prefixes. In the following  discussion, we assume N equals to one to simplify the mathematical analysis. ASes below the i  th level are assigned  prefixes by the providers locating at the adjacent higher level.

A provider should delegate a fraction of each of its prefixes to every customer at the adjacent lower level. Thus, the amount of ASh,j 's prefixes could be computed by (1).

(1)  Based on the introduction of advertisement policies in Section III, each AS?s routing table is generally composed of three parts: routes advertised from customers, providers and peers. In   Ci, ASes locating above the i  th level advertise to their  providers at the adjacent higher level and peers at the same level their owned prefixes and the prefixes advertised by their customers, since these customer prefixes are PI prefixes which could not be performed aggregation. On the other side, ASes at i th  level and the levels below could aggregate their customers? prefixes before advertising them to neighbors since these prefixes are sub-prefixes of the ASes. The amount of the prefixes advertised to AS?s peers after aggregation equals to the amount of AS?s own prefixes. We assume that each provider advertises only one default route to each of its customers. In fact, it is usually the option of most providers.

Thus, each domain should maintain several default routes, the amount of which equals to the amount of its providers.

Customer advertises to each of its providers only the correspondent prefixes that the provider allocates to it. Thus,  the amount of each AS?s routing table in different iC s is  computed by (2).

Note that the routing table size in our analysis refers to the  Routing Information Base (RIB) size which is transformed to Forwarding Information Base (FIB) size in Section V in order to compare with the global FIB size in today?s Internet.

V. EVALUATION  Based on the discussion above, this section discusses AS?s prefix amount and routing table size in different Cis by evaluation. In order to make a comparison, first we do a statistics about the distributions of prefix amount and routing table size in today?s Internet. Then, we decompose the Internet AS-level topology. Based on this decomposition result, the prefix assignment and routing advertisement are simulated in different Cis. After analysis of the distributions of prefix amount and routing table size in ASes, suitable deployment ways of HA are obtained. Our statistics and simulations are based on the real routing data which are collected by Route Views Project [9].

A. The Distributions of Prefix Amount and Routing Table Size in Today?s Internet  We believe that most of the assigned prefixes are presented in the global routing table. Thus, we analyze the global routing table to obtain the prefixes that each AS originates based on the BGP data on January 1  st 2011. In Fig. 1, there are four curves  presenting the distributions of prefix amount, prefix amount with aggregation, prefix amount without aggregator, prefix amount with aggregation without aggregator respectively. A point (x, y) in the curves records the percentage of ASes which advertise more than x prefixes is y. In the curve of prefix amount, about 85.6% of ASes have less than 10 prefixes.

13.07% of ASes own prefixes the amount of which is between 10 and 100. About 1.3% of ASes are assigned more than 100 prefixes. Considering some ASes de-aggregate their prefixes and advertise these specific prefixes into routing domains, we make a pretreatment in which we aggregate the aggregatable prefixes advertised by the same AS before investigating the distribution of prefix amount. The result is shown in the curve of prefix amount with aggregation. In the routing table, there are some prefixes which are generated by some ASes aggregating their customer prefixes. The distribution of prefix amount which excludes these prefixes is presented in the curve of prefix amount without aggregator. The curve of prefix amount with aggregation without aggregator shows the distribution of prefix amount in which not only those prefixes are excluded, but also the aggregatable prefixes advertised by the same AS are performed aggregation.

The distribution of prefix amount in Internet  Internet?s global routing table growth could be obtained from BGP report [2] shown that the global RIB size in Internet increases from 8,550,000 to 10,840,000 and the global FIB size has a growth from 191,500 to 351,585 within the five years between 2006 and 2011.

B. Decompositon of Internet AS-level Topology  We make a fine-granularity decomposition on Internet hierarchy to examine the impact of Cis on prefix amount and routing table size. The Internet hierarchy is mostly determined by the C2P/P2C relationships. The prefix assignment in HA is along the P2C hierarchy, and the route advertisements in customers are propagated along the C2P hierarchy to providers.

Thus, we decompose the Internet topology in terms of the P2C hierarchy. The isolated AS nodes and nodes which only have P2P edges are not included in this AS graph. Thus, it is a sub- graph of the complete Internet topology. First, we infer AS relationships using the algorithm proposed by Lixin Gao [25] with the BGP data in January 1  st 2011. The AS nodes and the  AS relationships constitute an AS graph. Then, the algorithm in Algorithm I ranks each AS along the P2C hierarchy. It begins with the top-tier ASes which have no providers. In the directed AS graph, having no providers means the indegree of the AS node is zero. The decomposition result reserves about 99.88% of the P2C relationships in the BGP data.

If ug is a customer of vi and ug.level <   (level+1)  10.             label_level(ug , level+1);  11.   }   C. The Distributions of Prefix Amount and Routing Table Size in Cis  The Internet topology decomposes into 50 levels. The ASes without providers locate at the 0  th level. In this section, the  cross-layer P2C relationships are included. In Ci, the prefix assignment is composed of two parts. In the first part, ASes above the i  th level including ASes locating at the i  th level are  assigned one PI prefix. In the second part, firstly the ASes above the i  th level assign a fraction of its prefix to the ASes  below the i th level if they are P2C. Then, in the zone of i  th - 50  th   levels, ASes at a higher level assign a fraction of each of its prefixes to ASes at each lower level when they have P2C relationships. This prefix assignment algorithm is shown in Algorithm II. The route advertisement in Ci is also composed of two parts: the HA zone and the non-HA zone. HA zone refers to the ASes below the i  th level which are deployed HA,  while the non-HA zone refers to the ASes above the i th level. In  the HA zone, the route advertisement starts from the ASes at  th level. Each AS at a lower level advertises to its providers  at each higher level (including all the higher levels in non-HA zone) the corresponding prefixes that they assign. Each AS also advertises its peers at the same level its prefixes. This process ends with the ASes at the i  th level. In the non-HA zone, the  route advertisement starts from the ASes at the i th  level and ends with the 0  th level. Each AS at a lower level advertises its  prefixes and the prefixes exported from its customers in the non_HA zone to its providers at the each higher level. The AS also advertises its peers at the same level its prefixes and the prefixes exported from its customers in the non_HA zone. The algorithm is shown in Algorithm III.

The evaluation results of different Ci scenarios are shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. All of the simulations from C0 to C50 have been performed. The curves in the Fig. 2 only present the distributions of prefixes in C0, C10,  C20,  C30 and C40  ALGORITHM II.

A point (x, y) in the curves of Fig. 2 represents the percentage of ASes which own more than x prefixes is y. It is shown that when i gets bigger, the prefix amount of arbitrary AS in different Ci is monotonically decreasing. The max prefix amount in each Ci is AS35052 owning 36,862,164 prefixes in C0, AS35052 owning 807,344 prefixes in C10, AS35052 owing 39,615 prefixes in C20, AS24298 owning 7,057 prefixes in C30, AS37062 owing 272 prefixes in C40.

Fig. 2. The distribution of prefix amount in Ci  The curves in the Fig. 3 present the distributions of routing table size in C0, C10, C20, C30, C40 and C50. A point (x, y) in the curves of Fig. 3 represents the percentage of ASes which own more than x routing table entries is y. The RIB/FIB ratio on January 2011 is 30.8445 [2]. In order to compare with today?s Internet, the RIB size will be transformed into FIB size in the following. The maximum RIB size of ASes locating at the 0  th   level is defined as the global routing table. Hence, the transform of the global RIB size is defined as the global FIB size. The global FIB size in C0-C50 increases progressively from 85 to 463,700,156 entries. Thus, we conclude that while i of Ci is getting bigger, the prefix amount of each AS is decreasing while the global FIB size is increasing. From the measurement result, we find C18 and C19 could solve the excessive prefix problem and reduce the global FIB size. The global FIB size in C18 is 112,280 which is only one third of the actual Internet?s global FIB size with 351,610 on January 2011 [2].  Although the max prefix amount in C18 is 112,990, the number of ASes which are assigned more than 10,000 prefixes is very small. Comparing with the distribution of prefix amount in today?s Internet, we think the prefix distribution in C18 is acceptable for today?s DNS and network operators. In addition, the prefix amount in C19 is smaller than the one in C18, but the global FIB size increases to about 200,000. Therefore, we can conclude that C18 and C19 are suitable HA deployment ways in which the excessive prefix problem is avoided and the global FIB size could be reduced into 56% or even 32% of the one in current Internet.

The evaluation result also proves that the excessive prefix problem of HA could make the smaller ISPs faced with big challenges. It is verified in our evaluation that some deployments of HA could greatly reduce the global FIB size in DFZ. The global FIB size only increases from 85 to 37,663 from C0 to C12. However, the FIB sizes of the ASes which may belong to smaller ISPs could be very large. For example, AS18302 is the AS which owns the maximum routing table size from C0 to C12. Its FIB size is decreased from 22,955,176 to 356,826. AS18302 locates at the 44  th level which is  definitely not the top-tier AS. Therefore, it is shown that although the global routing table is reduced significantly, the routing tables in the smaller ISPs could be large. These smaller ISPs could not operate normally or at least have to face a big    Fig. 3.

VI. CONLUSION  This paper is a first step toward quantitative assessment of  the impact of different HA deployment ways on the  distributions of prefix amount and routing table size to find  better deployment ways of hierarchical addressing. Firstly, we  define the model of the prefix assignment and the routing  advertisement in different HA deployment ways--Ci. Using  real Internet routing data, we simulate the processes of prefix  assignment and routing advertisement in different Cis based on the decomposition of actual Internet topology. We found that when i gets bigger, the prefix amount of arbitrary AS in Ci is getting smaller, while the global FIB size in C0-C50 increases monotonically. Comparing with the actual Internet data, it is concluded that C18 and C19 are suitable HA deployment ways in which the distribution of prefix amount is closer to the one of today?s Internet and the global FIB size could be reduced into 56% or even 32% of the one in current Internet. Since the decision of the suitable HA deployment ways depends on the Internet topology, our conclusion on the deployment ways of HA may be not suitable for the future Internet. But, we give an insight for the addressing of the future Internet. In addition, the evaluation result also proves that some HA deployment methods are not suitable to current Internet, e.g. the global deployment, since they may make some small ISPs faced with a big increase of the operation cost by increasing sharply their routing table sizes. In future work, we hope to prove the evaluation result by the mathematics derivation.
