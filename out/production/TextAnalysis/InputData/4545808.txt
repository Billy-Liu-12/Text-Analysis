Intelligent Multimedia Recommender by Integrating Annotation and  Association Mining

Abstract   Making a decision among a set of items from compound and complex information has been becoming a difficult task for common users.

Collaborative filtering has been the mainstay of automatically personalized search employed in contemporary recommender systems. Until now, it is still a challenging issue to reduce the gap between user perception and multimedia contents. To bridge user?s interests and multimedia items, in this paper, we present an intelligent multimedia recommender system by integrating annotation and association mining techniques. In our proposed system, low-level multimedia contents are conceptualized to support rule-based collaborative filtering recommendation by automated annotation. From the discovered relations between user contents and conceptualized multimedia contents, the proposed recommender system can provide a suitable recommendation list to assist users in making a decision among a massive amount of items.

1. Introduction   Modern communication technologies ease the multimedia data exchange on the Internet. From a massive amount of multimedia data, it is very difficult for a common user to obtain her/his preferred ones.

The main problem is that the gap between user contents and multimedia contents is so large that very little previous work succeeds in building a great multimedia recommender system. As shown in Figure 1, a traditional recommender system usually employs Collaborative filtering (CF) technique based on the assumption that people can be grouped to share their valuable purchase information each other to make an choice about the preferred items, such as movies, books, etc. Unfortunately, these contemporary recommender systems always put the focus on eliciting  the near-expert knowledge to predict user?s preference, but ignoring the semantic contents existing in discovered rules. In fact, form human perspective, semantic relationships between conceptualized multimedia contents and high-level human concepts are much easier to understand in providing users a good support to identify his preference. For instance, the rule ?{Young, Female}?{Tom_Cruise}? is more natural than the rule ?{Young, Female}? {color1, texture2, shape3}?.  Therefore, for conceptualizing multimedia contents, some annotation models by using machine learning and data mining techniques have been proposed over the past few years.

Automated annotation of multimedia contents actually does users a great favor on semantic multimedia retrieval. In addition to multimedia retrieval, semantic annotation can also convey the information about what users want. On the basis of this notion, in this paper, we implement an intelligent recommender system by integrating annotation and   DOI 10.1109/SUTC.2008.82       association mining techniques. On the one hand, several annotation approaches we ever developed are used to conceptualize multimedia data, including music and videos. On the other hand, the efficient association mining approach can discover implicit relations between conceptualized multimedia contents and user?s interest hidden in user?s behaviors. The experimental results reveal that the implemented system can really catch user?s intention.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

A review of related work is described in section 2. In section 3, we introduce our proposed recommender system. Conclusions and future work are discussed in section 4.

2. Related Work   In this section, the related past studies can be categorized into two main categories: Multimedia annotation and Recommendation strategy. In the followings, we are going to review and discuss the related work further.

2.1 Multimedia annotation   Generally speaking, the goal of multimedia  annotation is to provide search engines to assist user in accomplishing the conceptual multimedia retrieval.

Mainly, it takes advantage of low-level multimedia contents and high-level textual information to predict the suitable keywords. CRM (Continuous Relevance Model), is a classic statistics-based method developed by Lavrenko et al. [5][7] for annotating a video. It segments each sequential key-frame into several rectangle regions and then extracts the related visual features from these segmented regions. The annotations of each image are yielded soon after calculating the related probabilities with Gaussian Mixture Function. By assuming that regions in an image can be described using a small vocabulary of blobs, Jeon et al. [6] proposed probabilistic models that allow us to predict the probability of generating a word given the blobs in an image. Adams et al. [1] proposed a method integrating Gaussian Mixtures Model and Hidden Markov Model to discover the concepts of videos. Tseng et al. [17] proposed a novel web image annotation method, namely FMD (Fused annotation by Mixed model graph and Decision tree), which combines visual features and textual information to conceptualize the web images.

Additionally, for video annotation, Tseng et al.

[14][15][16] also developed a hybrid method to endow the videos with semantic-relevant keywords by  integrating visual features, speech features and frequent patterns.

2.2 Recommendation strategy   In recent years, many practical recommender  systems for multimedia data have been developed to provide users with personalized service, e.g., TiVo [2], MythTV [9] and so on. In these practical systems, the common characteristic is that the lists of recommended items are generated by users? logs with or without considering the relationships among users. In addition to above systems, a lot of solutions for recommendation have been widely used to deal with the recommendation problems. In this field, through subjective organization, some of model-based CF algorithms regard recommendation as behavior classification. Nikovski et al. [8] presented an induction of compact decision trees as the optimal recommendation policy. Breese et al. [4] attempted to solve the problems of personalized recommendation by Bayesian network. Another kind of recommendation strategy is memory-based algorithms that find the nearest neighbors to the active user by their similar behaviors. Social filtering is a classic user-based method that estimates the potential groups to share the preference information with the members in the same groups [3][12]. Whatever the previous recommendation strategy is, the semantic relations between users and items are ignored. However, the semantic relations can really assist system administrators or users in analyzing the preference information.

3. Proposed Recommender System   As mentioned in previous sections, the effective factor for recommender systems lies in the main percept: how to establish the semantic relations between users and items. In this section, we will describe the proposed approach for integrating the low-level multimedia contents and the high-level user?s contents to achieve the proposed recommender system.

3.1 Overview of the proposed system   Basically, the proposed system can be viewed as an  expert system. As illustrated in Figure 2, three main components are developed to generate the great recommendation list for multimedia data. First, low- level multimedia contents have to be converted into high-level concept terms by our proposed self-learning       annotation. Second, by jointing high-level concept terms, user profiles and usage logs, mining engine discovers the implicit rules as the knowledge base to help recommendation agent infer the personalized recommendation list. Finally, users can rate each item on the recommendation list and store the rating results into the usage database. The detailed descriptions are stated in the following subsections.

Figure 2. The framework of the proposed system.

3.2 Self-learning annotation   To facilitate the knowledge mining and preference discovery procedures, various learning approaches are employed to imply good annotation results. Basically, our proposed annotation tool can handle three kinds of multimedia data, including images videos and music.

Different kinds of multimedia data are annotated by different annotation strategies. In the followings, we will further describe how to annotate different multimedia data adaptively.

Figure 3. The self-learning annotation model.

3.2.1 Annotation for images and videos   In this work, as illustrated with Figure 3, a video clip can be decomposed into several shots containing  some key-objects. The main tasks of this work are to annotate the shots and the referred key-objects. To this end, we adopt different annotation strategies to finish the different kinds of annotation tasks.

Multi-level CBA (Classified By Association) model   This method is mainly based on the work in [18]. In  this work, we proposed a new image classification approach by using multiple level association rules based on these image objects. The proposed approach can be decomposed of three phases: (1) Building of conceptual object hierarchy, (2) Discovery of classification rules, and (3) Classification and prediction of images.

Figure 4. Procedure of Multi-level CBA model [18].

CRM model (Continuous Relevance Model)  This model is built based on CRM method proposed  in [7]. As depicted in Figure 5, through the computations of probabilities between the keywords and the regions, the proper keywords can be derived by their probabilities. The practical probability formulation will be given in the followings.

.

Then we can obtain a probability list containing the probability of each keyword while annotating an unknown shot. In these functions, w is the set of all candidate keywords, r is the set of all regions, N is the number of all shots and J is a specific un-annotated shot.

ICOA model (Intelligent Concept-Oriented Annotation model)        As shown in Figure 6, this work proposes a  framework to catch the high-level concepts by performing content-based image understanding approach. It first segments the shot into several regions and identifying each segmented region by classification models, e.g., decision tree, SVM, KNN and so on.

Figure 5. Procedure of CRM model.

Figure 6. Procedure of ICOA model.

MMG model (Mixed Media Graph)   This notion of this model based on [10]  concentrates on connecting the objects and the captions via the shots. For example, as illustrated in Figure 7, (A) stands for two annotated images {I1, I2} which referred captions are {sea, sun, sky, waves} and {cat, forest, grass, tiger} with respect to {t1, t2, t3, t4} and {t5, t6, t7, t8}, and which referred main objects are {r1, r2, r3, r4} and {r5, r6, r7}. To provide a sufficient keyword exploration, a three-layer MMG model, as shown in (B), can be formed as a hierarchical structure according to the information from (A). Each hierarchy of them is an image containing the referred captions at the 1st level and the referred objects at the 3rd level.

The connection of each hierarchy is determined if the  visual distance between the objects of different hierarchies is close enough, for example as shown in Figure 7, {r7?r4}, {r6?r3} and {r5?r4}.

Figure 7. MMG model [10].

Multi-Content mining model  In this method, we propose an innovative method  for semantic video annotation through integrated mining of visual features, speech features and frequent semantic patterns existing in the video. As shown in Figure 8, the proposed method mainly consists of two main phases: 1) Construction of four kinds of predictive annotation models, namely speech- association, visual-association, visual-sequential and statistical models from annotated videos, and 2) Fusion of these models for annotating un-annotated videos automatically.

Figure 8. Procedure of Multi-Content mining model [16].

3.2.2 Annotation for music   In contrast to videos, music contents are simpler to be analyzed. However music is so popular that we have to keep an eye on the solution for semantic music annotation. As depicted in Figure 9, music in Mpeg 3 is first transformed into MDCT (Modified Discrete       Cosine Transform) value. According to the transformed features, four semantic feature terms can be derived by annotation model or our defined functions.

Figure 9. Procedure of music annotation.

Currently we have implemented an annotation tool that integrates various annotation models for images, videos and music. In Figure 10, the interface can be divided into several major panels. The operation procedure starts with opening an un-annotated multimedia data by panel (H). Next, the multimedia data is split into some shots and users can manually annotate the first-k shots by panel (A) and (C).

Afterward the training operation is performed by panel (E). Thereby, automated annotation terms can be inferred by panel (E) and the results are shown in panel (B), (D), (G) and (F). Finally the annotation terms are stored into the database. The generated annotation terms are important elements for rule/knowledge mining. Without these annotation terms, the multimedia data cannot be semantically connected with user?s interest.

3.3 Mining Engine  Because the projection between shots and linguistic terms has been made by annotation models, the recommendation results are easier to be explained in human sense. The notion of mining engine is used to discover the multimedia annotation terms frequently purchased by the specific user groups. That is, the annotation terms and special user contents frequently occurring in a list of transactions, called transaction table shown in Table 1, can help recommender system  clarify the specific preference shared by the users on similar behaviors. A recommendation session can be viewed as a transaction and a transaction contains the annotation terms and special user contents viewed as items. In this work, we adopted CBW approach [11] to mine the rules since CBW is an efficient algorithm for association mining. Thus, a transformed transaction can be defined as:  < UserContent, ItemContent > where UserContent denotes the set of the user contents, ItemContent denotes the set of the item contents including annotation terms. Let?s take an example of association rule.

{(Gender, Female), (Age, Young), (Occupation, Teacher)?(Residence, Taipei)} ? {(Category, Love),  (Actor, Tom_Cruise)} says that most of female teachers living in Taipei always like watching love movies presented by Tom_Cruise. This kind of frequent patterns can assist not only recommender system in eliciting the best recommendation list but also the system administrator in strengthening the personalized service.

Table 1. The transaction table.

Transaction id Item  1001 Female, Leo, Young, Teacher, Taipei, love, Tom_Cruise  1002 Female, Libra, Young, Teacher, Taipei, love, Tom_Cruise  1003 Male, Taurus, Young, Student, Kaohsiung, Love, Meg_Ryan   3.4 Recommendation Agent  After elaborating on self-learning annotation and  mining engine, now we are going to explain how to yield the recommendation list by rule-matching-based method. In our system, traditional first-rater problem can be prevented because the preference for the active user who never visits our system can be predicted by the rules. Otherwise, for the system members, personal log and generated rules are both considered reasoning the preferred multimedia products. As shown in Figure 11, if recommendation agent cannot find out the rules whose left-hand patterns match the active user?s contents, hot multimedia products are then found by the issuing date and the purchasing frequency.

Whatever case it is, top 10 multimedia products have to be judged finally.

Figure 11. The framework of recommendation agent.

3.4.1 Search Multimedia by Rules   Then we continue expressing how to search multimedia products by rules. As shown in Figure 12 and Figure 13, if the cardinality of right-hand contents is larger than one, recommendation agent has to look for all of the products containing the right-hand content pattern by pattern. Then it generates the intersection set of the found products. Note that the final results are still sorted by the issuing date and the purchasing frequency.

Figure 12. Procedure for searching multimedia by rules.

Figure 13. Procedure for selecting multimedia by right-hand  content.

Figure 14. Procedure for searching multimedia by personal  log.

3.4.2 Search Multimedia by Personal Log   This operation is mainly aimed at the special members whose contents cannot match any rule in the rule database. As shown in Figure 14, first, all of transactions for the special member have to be collected. Second, select the most five favorite multimedia categories by the referred purchase frequency. Third, find the most favorite actor whose purchase count is the largest. Fourth, combine the most five favorite multimedia categories and the additional category presented by the most favorite actor into six candidate categories. At last, according to the purchase ratio of each category, select un-purchased products for each candidate category.

Table 2. The transaction table for the active user.

Table 3. The transaction table of the favorite actor X for the  active user.

Table 4. The resulting table for recommendation.

Example 1. Suppose that there are 12 products belonging to 3 categories {Action, Adventure, Love,  Horror, Science-Fiction}, which are ever purchased by the active user u. Table 2 shows an transaction example for u. From the transactions, actor X is the most favorite actor for u. Table 3 shows that the transaction table of the favorite actor X for u. As shown in Table 4, for each category, the amount of recommended products can be computed by the referred ratio.

4. Conclusions   Collaborative-filtering based recommender system has been shown that it can provide users with the great support to make a decision among a huge amount of precuts. However, semantic relations between user?s interest and the products are ignored in past studies. In this paper, we have presented an intelligent recommender system to bridge user?s interest and the products by integrating annotation and association mining techniques. The low-level multimedia contents can be converted into the linguistic terms and the discovered relations are indeed very valuable for the recommendation strategy and the system administrator.

In the future, we will further investigate the aggregation for other recommendation strategies.
