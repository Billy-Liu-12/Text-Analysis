Abstract?Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have the capacity to revolutionize data gathering in both spaceflight and terrestrial applications.12  WSNs provide a huge advantage over traditional, wired instrumentation since they do not require wiring trunks to connect sensors to a central hub.  This allows for easy sensor installation in hard to reach locations, easy expansion of  the number of sensors or sensing modalities, and reduction in both system cost and weight.  While this technology offers unprecedented flexibility and adaptability, implementing it in practice is not without its difficulties.  Recent advances in standards- based WSN protocols for industrial control applications have come a long way to solving many of the challenges facing practical WSN deployments.  In this paper, we will overview two of the more promising candidates ? WirelessHART from the HART Communication Foundation and ISA100.11a from the International Society of Automation  ? and present the architecture for a new standards-based sensor node for networking and applications research.
