I.  INTRODUCTION Combining the 10 stems and 12 branches, the Chinese  sexagenary cycle can be formed, which is widely used in Chinese ancient culture especially in TCM as a most important way of counting the years, months or dates. Usually each combination of a stem and a branch is also attributed with a corresponding element known as the five elements of containing notes[1]. According to legend, both He tu and Luo shu  initially emerged as groups of black and white dots[2], where each group of black dots has even dot number and the other groups  have odd number of white dots respectively.

Either He tu or Luo shu has shown the same proneness to emphasize modular number of 5. Usually according to the Hong fan section in Shang shu to interpret group numbers of He tu and Luo shu: number 1 is water; Number 2 is fire; Number 3 is wood; Number 4 is metal; Number 5 is soil [2]. In this paper, according to modular and grouping mathematical rules included in He tu, Luo shu and stem-branch theory, novel associations are discovered between the five elements of containing notes and the Fibonacci modular sequence,which is of great value to reduce the mysterious sense of ancient Chinese culture and is quite helpful to uncover the final scientific secret of Wu yun liu qi theory in TCM.



II. THE NEW DISCOVERY  A. Two Key subsequences of Fibonacci sequence modulo 10 and 5 The Fibonacci sequence has a periodic property while  performed modular operation by an integer n. While setting the value of n be 10, the period is equal to 60 and the corresponding periodic sequence can be listed as below [3]:  1 1 2 3 5  8 3 1 4 5  9 4 3 7 0  7 7 4 1 5  6 1 7 8 5  3 8 1 9 0  9 9 8 7 5  2 7 9 6 5  1 6 7 3 0   3 3 6 9 5  4 9 3 2 5  7 2 9 1 0  Further, performing operation modulo 5 on each number of the above sequence, a new recycled sequence with equal length of 60 can then be obtained:  1 1 2 3 0  3 3 1 4 0  4 4 3 2 0  2 2 4 1 0  1 1 2 3 0  3 2 1 4 0  4 4 3 2 0  2 2 4 1 0  1 1 2 3 0  3 2 1 4 0  4 4 3 2 0  2 2 4 1 0  Dividing the latest obtained sequence into two subsequences SQ1, SQ2 according to parity of the index of each number and the grouping result is listed as below:  SQ1 1 2 0 3 4  4 3 0 2 1  1 2 0 3 4  4 3 0 2 1  1 2 0 3 4  4 3 0 2 1  SQ2 (1 3)  3 1 0 4 2  2 4 0 1 3  3 1 0 4 2  2 4 0 1 3  3 1 0 4 2  2 4 0 1 3  For analyzing convenience, all the numbers are rearranged into groups of new 5-tuples in SQ2 without changing its basic index order except moving the first two numbers to the end.

Apparently with a repeat number of 3, the obtained SQ1, SQ2 subsequences take number series of 1 2 0 3 4 and 3 1 0 4 2 together with their corresponding palindrome as repeated kernel subsequence respectively. In mathematics, the number 0 is just equal to 5 in the viewpoint of operation modulo 5, therefore, key number series of 1 2 0 3 4 and 3 1 0 4 2 can also be seen as 1 2 5 3 4 and 3 1 5 4 2.

B. New arrangements of the five elements of containing  notes  Based on traditional Chinese culture, each of the containing notes associates a unique symbol as well as Hong fan attribute  of five elements with a stem-branch combination and two neighbored stem-branch combination pairs share the same symbol and attribute  as shown in Table I [1].  Actually the stem-branch combinations are just the permutation and combination between Yang group of stems and branches as well as Yin group of them.  While studying the rules behind the stem-branch combinations, the author found a new arrangement of the stem-branch combinations based on simple and determinate transforming from the original arranging order in traditional Chinese culture as shown in Table I by the ?Sequence No.? column. That is, take the  pair(11th and 12th stem-branch combinations in Table I) as the initial pair and take equation (m+22) mod 60   ( herein ?mod? represents modular operation) as a recursive rule to obtain the successive one of all recycled pairs. And the 5 by 6 array form of the new arrangement is shown in Fig.2(where the correspondent Hong fan Attribute and  Number is also labeled )        TABLE I.  THE FIVE ELEMENTS OF CONTAINING NOTES    2  2  2  4  4  4 5  5  5  1  1  1 3  3  3  2  2  2 4  4  4  5  5  5 1  1  1  3  3  3 Fig. 2  The 5 by 6 array form of the new arrangement  Looking from up to bottom , it is obvious in Fig.2 that each column of the Hong fan number is one of the recycle- shifting sequence of 12534 just by one position, i.e., 25341 or 41253, and looking from the end there is exactly three appositions of 31542 31542.  Above discovery is not only a special case. Based on Table I it can also derive two other arrangements as listed in  Fig.3 grouped by the 12 branches or 8 stem-branch pair after extending one duplicate of whole 60 elements without changing the original sequence order from  ,  to ,  in Table I. For convenience consideration, only the correspondent Hong fan number for each stem-branch pair is listed in Fig.3.

a)                                                                    b) Fig.3 Two other derived arrangements based on Table I. a) Arrangement group by the 12 branches; b) Arrangement by 8 stem-branch pair after extended by one duplicate of whole 60 elements  Obviously, in each column of Fig.3 a) the Hong fan numbers are the recycle-shifting sequence of 12534 by certain offset number. And in each column of Fig.3 b), by recycling view, the Hong fan numbers all show a similar appositional pattern of three same recycle-shifting sequences of 31542.



III. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, the 12534 and 31542 key number series about  the Fibonacci sequence are obtained. And by simple and determinate transforming a new 5 by 6 arrangement about the five elements of containing notes is introduced,which has shown close relationship with the two obtained key subsequences. As the new derived arrangement is directly acquired from the original indices of stem-branch combinations by fixed mathematical operation, the rules implied in the new arrangement also reflects that of the original arrangement of stems and branches in traditional Chinese culture. Another two derived arrangements also show close relationship with sequence 12534 or 31542 respectively, therefore it can be inferred that the five elements of containing notes must have underlying profound mathematic relationship with the Fibonacci modular sequence and is worthy of researching further, which is undoubtedly quite helpful to recover the scientific secret of Wu yun liu qi theory in TCM as well as that of whole traditional Chinese culture system.
