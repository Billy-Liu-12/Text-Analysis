TEST AND EVALUATION FOR DETERMINING SCREENER TRAINING  EFFECTIVENESS

Abstract - For many years, the only FAA- approved checkpoint screener-training program was a classroom lecture developed by the Air Transport Association. In April 1997, the FAA also approved the use of a Computer-Based Training (CBT) program for initial screener training prior to on-the- job training. This study describes a comprehensive test and evaluation of four training programs currently in use at US airports. The evaluation will determine the efficacy of the individual training programs.

Because the variety of training options is growing, the FAA has developed a single uniform measure of mastery of initial training, the Screener Readiness Test (SRT).

This preparedness evaluation is designed to test newly trained screeners for checkpoint related knowledge and abilities. The test contains multiple-choice questions on checkpoint rules and the major checkpoint screening tasks. It also measures screeners? ability to detect threat articles in X-ray images of bags.

One hundred ninety two new security screeners participated in this study. Each screener was randomly assigned to one of the four training systems (i.e., 48 screeners per training system). Half of these screeners were tested with SRT immediately after training. This measured their screener- relevant knowledge and abilities. The results allowed us to determine which training system produced the most capable screeners, thus allowing us to compare the four training systems. The other half of the screeners took the SRT as a pretest prior to  0-7803-6636-0/01/$10.00 02001 IEEE 96  training and then again after training. This pretest/posttest within-subjects design allowed us to measure the amount of learning that could be attributed to each training system. An additional overall performance measure was developed taking into account screener candidate dropout rates. A multiplicative model was used in which either low SRT test scores or high attrition rates would lead to a poor overall performance score.

This paper will discuss the outcome of this effort and report on the testing and performance of the classroom and CBT training systems using the SRT.

Introduction  The evaluation was conducted fiom September 18, 2000 to February 28, 2001.

The efficacy of four training programs was evaluated: three CBT (Safe Passage International Limited, International Consultants on Targeted Security, and Smart Approach Limited) and Air Transport Association?s (ATA) classroom training program.

Two hundred sixty-four new screener trainees (i.e., new trainees without prior screening experience) from Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport, Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport, and Seattle-Tacoma International Airport were randomly assigned to one of four training programs. Of the 264 new screeners assigned to the training programs, 192 individuals completed training. One-half of    these candidates received training (CBT or ATA) followed by the SRT posttest. The other half of the candidates received the SRT pretest followed by CBT or ATA training and the SRT posttest. Performance on the SRT was used to discriminate between alternative screener training programs.

The data from screeners that were tested on the SRT only after receiving training were used to determine the relative effect of each training program on screeners? SRT performance. This component of the test design allowed for the examination of differences between the training programs without the potential influence of prior experience on the SRT. The data from screeners that received the SRT prior to training and also the SRT following training were used to evaluate the absolute effectiveness of each program. This component of the test design allowed for the determination of screeners? baseline knowledge prior to receiving any training.

By obtaining baseline performance on the SRT and post-training performance on the SRT, the amount of learning that occurred as a result of each training program could be assessed.

Results  Content Questions  There was no significant difference between the training programs on the question subtest of the SRT. Percent correct performance on the question subtest improved from pretest to posttest, and this improvement was similar for each of the training programs.

Image Questions  The SRT contains a subtest of 50 X-ray images designed to assess screeners? ability  to detect threats. Statistical analysis using a Between-Groups Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) showed there was a significant difference in hit rates between the different training programs for those screeners receiving only an SRT posttest. Post hoc analyses revealed that only one CBT system produced a statistically significant higher hit rate than ATA. Between-Groups ANOVA revealed there was a significant difference in false alarm rates between the different training programs for those screeners receiving only an SRT posttest.

In general, higher hit rates were associated with higher false alarm rates, which made it difficult to assess the relative performance of each training program. Therefore, Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve (A,), which is a single measure of performance based upon both the hit rates and false alarm rates, (analogous to d?), was calculated for each training program.

Specifically, A, was obtained by estimating the underlying ROC curve for each screener.

This was done by fitting the curve to two operating points derived from the frequency of screeners? possible and definite threat responses to threats and non-threats. The best fitting curve to the data passes through these points. A, is simply the area under this curve. This approach has the following advantages: a) all available information from the response distribution goes into the estimation of parameters, b) the slope of the ROC curve is estimated rather than assumed, and c) A, can be explained in a way that provides a more intuitive feeling for the number. Specifically, given that the ROC model is appropriate for the task, A, can be interpreted as the percent correct that would be obtained in a forced choice task where, on each trial, the screener had to decide which of two bags contained a threat.

A, has a maximum value of 1 .O.

Statistical analysis using Between-Groups ANOVA revealed a significant difference in A, values between the different training programs for those screeners receiving only an SRT posttest. Post hoc analyses using the Bonfen-oni method revealed that only one CBT system produced a statistically significant higher A, value than ATA.

Within-Groups ANOVA revealed there was an effect of test time (i.e., pretest versus posttest) on hit rates and on false alarm rates. Overall, both hit rates and false alarm rates were higher after receiving training than before receiving training. To assess whether each of the training programs resulted in a differential amount of learning, the interaction of test time and training program was analyzed using a Mixed- Groups Factorial ANOVA for hit rates and false alarm rates. There was no significant interaction of test time and training program on hit rates and on false alarm rates. These results indicate that screener hit rates and false alarm rates increased after receiving training, but the training programs were similar in the amount of learning they produced as reflected by the SRT hit rates and SRT false alarm rates. Overall, hit rates increased from the SRT pretest to the SRT posttest; however, overall false alarm rates also increased from the SRT pretest to the SRT posttest.

Planned two-way interaction comparisons were conducted to examine the joint influence of test time and training program on hit rates and false alarm rates at the individual comparison level. Paired comparisons between each of the training programs using two-way Mixed-Groups Factorial ANOVAs revealed a single deviation from the overall pattern.

Statistical analysis revealed a significantly different increase in hit rates between ATA and one CBT system.

Due to an increase in both hit rates and false alarm rates following training, it was difficult to determine the accurate absolute effectiveness of each training program.

Therefore, A, was calculated for SRT pretest and SRT posttest scores between each training program. Using Within-Groups ANOVA, there was an effect of test time (i.e., pretest versus posttest) on A,. Overall, A, values were higher after receiving training than before receiving training. To assess whether each of the training programs resulted in a differential amount of learning, the interaction of test time and training program was assessed for A, values.

Mixed-Groups Factorial ANOVA revealed there was no significant interaction of test time and training program on A, values.

These results indicate that screener A, values increased after receiving training, but the training programs were similar in the amount of learning they produced as reflected by the SRT A, values. Overall, A, values increased from the SRT pretest to the SRT posttest.

The interaction between training program and threat category for hit rate was assessed using a Mixed-Groups Factorial ANOVA to reveal any differences in the performances of the training programs between each of the threat categories. There was a significant interaction between threat category and training program for hit rates. Post hoc analyses revealed that the nature of this interaction was such that there was no significant influence of training program on hit rates for grenades or guns. There was a significant influence of training program on hit rates for IEDs; however, upon individual comparisons of training programs for hit rates on IEDs, there were no significant differences between the training programs.

This discrepancy is an artifact of the statistical test. While there were no differences at the individual comparison     level, by combining the data from each of the groups, enough power was generated to make the effect significant. There was a significant influence of training program on hit rates for knives. For knives, one CBT system had a higher hit rate than ATA and another CBT system, but ho other differences between the training programs were found for knives. There was a significant influence of training program on hit rates for MBSs.

Pretest / Posttest Improvement 0 (Pd)  Conclusions  c , ?  e All of the training programs demonstrated screener learning, as evidenced by higher SRT scores for posttest SRT than pretest, but none of the programs produced dramatic changes in posttest scores. Improvements ranged from 8 -12% in SRT composite score for the different programs. This result may indicate that more effective training methods need to be developed or that more time needs to be devoted to training prior to final evaluation.
