A Novel Web Authoritative Page Mining Algorithm  Based on Association Analysis

Abstract?Internet server as a distributing global information service center which produced much amount of data every time or every day; it is a very urgent need to get interesting and important information from internet efficiently and timely to everyone of us. Web consists of not only the amount of page, but also the structure link and the used recorder, which contain much useful and important information such as custom access action, the quality of the Web page and similar user classification. The paper make use of the user access sequences to produce the vast forward path, by the preprocessing get the frequent access crunodes, then introduce association analysis method in data mining to generating the authoritative sites. Finally, the instance illustrated the affectivity and feasibility.

Keywords- vast forward path; association analysis; frequency access crunodes

I. INTRODUCTION With the development of information generation,  especially the development of computer and communication technology, the problem of ?rich data and lack of knowledge? become more and more acute. And at the same time, which lead to the emergence of technology of data warehouse and data mining [1]. Many researchers are aroused by the interests of these fields such as artificial intelligent, patter classification and machine learning.

Currently, WWW is tremendous wide global informational service center, which involves in news, finance and economics, ad, commerce, culture, education and other information service [2]. It is developed with an unbelievable speed. An increasing number of people are joining the ?Information Age? via the Internet. In all of these huge and isomeric web resource, these are include many link structure information that easily is to ignored, but they are very important to user, excepting  rich text, image, audio and video information. Because these link information also include much useful and important knowledge. It well knows that web not only consist of page, but also link that point to page. Many of these links contain the custom of access the web page, quality of page, user classification et al [3]. in this paper, we utilize the sites link information to generate the vast forward path and then produce user frequent access crunodes. The user frequent access crunodes represent the node or page that be frequently accessed. We can use these information optimize web structure.

The rest part of this paper is organized as follows. First, a brief description of existing techniques is given in  Section 2. Section 3 detailed proposed algorithm. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section 4

II. STATUS AND LIMITATION The main objective of Web structure mining is to find  internal relations of all web pages, access model and access custom of user. At present, all of research in this field is to find authorities page using web link. The basic principle can be felled into two categories (1) Page-Rank; it is one of very famous and successful algorithm in web structure mining. The main idea is that if one page is cited by many pages, or if the page is cited by a very important page, we can consider the page is authoritative page. At the same time, the importance of the page can be transferred to the page that cited it [4, 5, 6]. (2) Hub Page; a Hub Page is refer to one or many Web page, which offered the structure sets that contain authoritative page. To the Hub Page, It is possible that the page is not very important or authoritative, but which possible contain very important structure link information. The main existing rank algorithm is HITS [7, 8, 9] (Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search).

Figure 1. Hub page and Authority page  These are also any other structure mining methods proposed in this area. Zhou xiao-zheng, liu kan et. Al.

proposed a self-organizing map based web structure mining algorithm [10]. Wang yi-lei lin shi-ping, et. Al proposed a hyperlink text based mining algorithm. The main idea is all come from above classical algorithm [11].

Above mentioned techniques have reasonable aspect in practice, but all existing parts limitation. To the first case, it is well known that not all the link are important or very useful, some of them have other intention such as competition or advertisement. To the second case, it seems that method has a good performance in theory, but in practice, it is very difficult to realize. To overcome the    limitation of above methods, the paper proposed a novel Web authoritative page mining algorithm, which can effective solve the above problem.



III. PROPOSED ALGORITHM The proposed algorithm include following three steps,  finally, an instance is give to illustrate the feasibility of our algorithm.

A. Extraction of  vast forward path Internet is a huge and global unstructured unit. It  includes not only different Web pages, but also some stochastic and frequent access link structure. If we regard many Web pages as crunodes, and link structure as directed edge. In addition, using the weights represents the number of link, the whole huge internet can be considered as weight directed digraph. We can represent weight directed digraph as following equation (1).

G= V E                                             (1) Where V is the sets of page, sometimes also called  vertex and E is the sets of link in different page, sometimes also called edge. The input edge of vertex V represent the citation of vertex v, and output edge of vertex V represent the citation to the other edge. The weight represents the number of the citation.

In order to construct the model, the paper introduces directed graph represent the user access action path. Since directed graph is very sophisticated, unstructured, and even have loop, we must take any other measure to solve it.  In this paper, the vast forward path (TVFP) is proposed to overcome it.

Definition 1: the vast forward path (TVFP) User access path are the page sequences that accessed  during the browsing process by internet user, and the vast forward path are the access path that consist of page which turn back to the previous page. For example, suppose that a user access sequences are A B A C D C; the vast forward path can be represent A B and A C D.

The vast forward path implies that all the relational crunodes have some relations or some same property. We can regard all these pages as the same categories.

B. Association analysis and Apriori algorithm Association rule mining is the most important and  active research area in data mining in recent years. The main purpose is to mine interesting relation or frequent item sets from amounts of data sets. This process commonly represented by A?B in much public paper, and usually, support and confidence are measured using following index.

Support: support(A?B)=P(A B) Confidence: confidence (A?B) =P (A|B) The rules that satisfy minimum support and  confidence threshold called strong association rules, usually, these threshold determined by user or relational field experts.

The association rule mining in data mining mainly includes two steps:  (1) Finding out all of frequent item sets.

(2) Generating strong association rules from frequent  item sets.

Definition 2: the method that using idea of association rule to extract interesting relations from data sets called association analysis.

Apriori algorithm is a very influential and classical idea to mine frequent item sets. The highlight of the algorithm is Apriori properties adopted.

C. The application of  association analysis in web mining  According to definition 1, vast forward path can be extracted through preprocessing to user access path sequences. A vast forward path is a linear path sequence, and all these sequences can construct a relational data base. By scanning data base and analyzing using association analysis, we can obtain the maxmum access crunodes sets.  Each access crunodes sets can be regard similar type user. The whole process can be descripting as following steps:  Step 1: extracting vast forward path according to user access path sequences.

Step 2: scanning vast forward path, and counting the number of sequences that greater than 2 item.

Step 3: generating frequent access crunodes according to support threshold.

Step 4: combining frequent access crunodes and generate authorities? sites.

D. Instance to the proposed algorithm Step 1: extracting vast forward path  Suppose that a directed a graph formed by user access path is as fig. 2.

Figure 2. Directed graph formed by user access path  According to definition 1, we can get following vast forward path sequences.

AB ACD CDE ABCDE BCDE ABD ACDE ACD CDE ADE  Step 2: scanning all of sequences, and counting number that greater than 2 item. The results showed as TABLE I, TABLE II, TABLE III and TABLE IV    TABLE I. 2 ITEM SETS  item support AB 3 AC 4 AD 6 AE 4 BC 2 BD 3 BE 2 CD 7 CE 5 DE 6  TABLE II. 3 ITEM SETS  item support ABC 1 ABD 2 ABE 1 ACD 4 ACE 2 ADE 3 BCD 2 BDE 2 CDE 5 ADE 3 BCD 2 BDE 2 CDE 5  TABLE III. 4 ITEM SETS  item support ABCD 1 ABDE 1 ACDE 1 BCDE 2  TABLE IV. 5 ITEM SETS  item support ABCDE 1  Step 3: generating frequent access node according to support threshold.

To the 2 item sets, set support is 5, the frequent node is:  AD CD CE DE.

To the 3 item sets, set support is 3,the frequent node  is : ACD ADE CDE.

To the 4 item, set support is 2, the frequent node is : BCDE.

Frequent user access node imply that these exist  some interesting relation in all sites, so if we optimize page structure or construct web, to enhance the efficiency of browser, we must let them together.

Step 4: combining frequent access node and get authorities sites.

Analyze frequent user access node extracted from previous sequences using association analysis and count the number of crunodes, we can get the following TABLE V.

TABLE V.  FREQUENT ACCESS CRUNODES  item support A 2 B 2 C 5 D 6 E 5  If we set the minmum support value equal 5, the crunodes C, D, E represent the frequent access crunodes, i.e. C, D, E are frequent access crunodes, we also called them authority pages

IV. CONCLUSION Web mining is a hot of data mining in recent years,  especially to the Web structure mining or Web log mining.

Since it able to cope with the abundance of available information, users of the Web need to rely on intelligent tools that assist them in finding, sorting, and filtering the available information. Just as data mining aims at discovering valuable information that is hidden in conventional databases, the emerging field of web mining aims at finding and extracting relevant information that is hidden in Web related data. By using the association analysis, the propose algorithm can mine authority pages from internet Web, and the instance can verify the validity and feasibility.
