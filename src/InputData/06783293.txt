Keynote Speech 2P.2  Wednesday, March 5 9:00AM-9:30AM  Carbon Nanotube Computer: Transforming Scientific Discoveries into Working Systems  Subhasish Mitra Professor and Director of the Robust Systems Group  Stanford University Carbon Nanotube Field Effect Transistors (CNFETs) are excellent candidates for building highly energy-efficient future electronic systems. Unfortunately, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are subject to substantial inherent imperfections that pose major obstacles to the design of robust and very large-scale CNFET digital systems: It is nearly impossible to guarantee perfect alignment and positioning of all CNTs. This limitation introduces stray conducting paths, resulting in incorrect circuit functionality. CNTs can be metallic or semiconducting depending on chirality. Metallic CNTs cause shorts resulting in excessive leakage and incorrect circuit functionality. A combination of design and processing techniques overcomes these challenges by creating robust CNFET digital circuits that are immune to these inherent imperfections. This imperfection-immune design paradigm enables the first experimental demonstration of the carbon nanotube computer, and, more generally, arbitrary digital systems that can be built using CNFETs. Monolithically integrated three-dimensional CNFET circuits will also be discussed. This research was performed at Stanford University in collaboration with Prof. H.-S. Philip Wong and several graduate students.

About Subhasish Mitra Professor Subhasish Mitra directs the Robust Systems Group in the Department of Electrical Engineering and the Department of Computer Science of Stanford University, where he is the Chambers Faculty Scholar of Engineering. Before joining Stanford, he was a Principal Engineer at Intel Corporation. Prof. Mitra's research interests include robust system design, VLSI design, CAD, validation and test, and emerging nanotechnologies. His X-Compact technique for test compression has been key to cost-effective manufacturing and high-quality testing of a vast majority of electronic systems, including numerous Intel products. X-Compact and its derivatives have been implemented in widely-used commercial Electronic Design Automation tools. The QED and IFRA techniques, created jointly with his students, have shown outstanding results in overcoming critical bottlenecks in post- silicon validation and debug for several commercial hardware platforms, and have been characterized as "breakthrough" in a Research Highlight in the Communications of the ACM. His work on carbon nanotube imperfection-immune digital VLSI, jointly with his students and collaborators, resulted in the demonstration of the first carbon nanotube computer, and it was featured on the cover of NATURE    (Sept. 2013). The National Science Foundation presented this work as a Research Highlight to the United States Congress, and it also was highlighted as "an important, scientific breakthrough" by the BBC, Economist, EE Times, IEEE Spectrum, MIT Technology Review, New York Times, Scientific American, Time, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, and numerous other organizations worldwide.

Keynote Speech 2P.3  Wednesday, March 5 9:30AM-10:00AM  Can You Trust the Internet of Things? A Look at Security of All Things Connected  Stacy Cannady Technical Marketing - Trustworthy Computing TRIAD (Threat Response, Intelligence, and  Development) for Cisco and a member of the Trusted Computing Group  Once we worried about the security of our desktop computers. Then came increasingly powerful and connected mobile devices?which offered the keys to the kingdom to anyone willing to spend a bit of time attacking them. Now, in addition to our continuing concerns about devices we now see as powerful computers, we must look to securing the next generation of connected devices.

But these devices don't fit on the desktop or even in the hand. They instead are scattered around the home, the office, the manufacturing plant, the retail store and even on the highway. Home appliances, cars, personal fitness devices, medical devices, factory automation systems, thermostats and security systems, even a smoke detector - these all fit in the Internet of Things.

Therefore, security must be considered. This talk will address some key issues and core concepts of IoT security including the possible role of trust and use of existing and evolving industry standards. Attendees will get a new perspective on embedded strong security into a variety of devices. This session includes discussion of several security architectures already deployed in IoT devices and includes resources for the tools used to implement those architectures (mostly available for free).
