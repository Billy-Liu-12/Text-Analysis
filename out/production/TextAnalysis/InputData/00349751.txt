Rules For Deriving Basic Semiconductor Region Models  Bruno ALLARD, member IEEE, HeWC MOREL, Chung-Chieh LIN, Hichem HELALI, Jean-Pierre CHANTE, member IEEE

Abstract - We discuss .some main rules .for deriving power semiconductor device modular models. The method is based on the classical regional hypothesis that parts any power semiconductor device in basic semiconductor regions as : the neutral ohmic region, the gradient-doping neutral regon, the high-levet injection region, the space-charge region and the field-efect region. But specific rules have to be observed in the model definition in order to obtain reusable models. 7hen a power semiconductor devlce model becomes a simple association of several of the basic semiconductor region models : a bond graph. The space charge region model description is covered Sign! ficant results are presented.

I - INTRODUCTION  CAD is hardly used in power electronic field today. One main reason is that power semiconductor device accurate models are not available except the power MOS transistor model. In fact numerous works concerned the power MOS transistor while few works focused on the bipolar power semiconductor devices. We may note that the published results are not fully satisfying! For example the commercially available simulators Saber and Spice do not offer any PIN diode model or any power bipolar transistor model.

The main difficulty is the occurrence of a high-level injection region inside the bipolar power semiconductor devices. This layer reduces the on-state device voltage drop but also increases the turn-off transient.

The high-level injection region (HIR) is the area of carrier storage that is a distributed phenomenon, described by the ambipolar diffusion equation (partial differential equation).

We have already proposed power bipolar semiconductor device models [l-51. Particularly we have shown [2,3] that the Intemal Approximation method (a Variational Approximation technique) enables to derive a HIR state-variable model, a set of ordinary and differential equations (depending on the time variable). The method most important advantage is to yield a low-cost state-variable model compared to the discretization techniques [6].  The HIR model brings a real improvement to the PIN diode model compared to other available models [7].

We have successfully applied the method to the power bipolar transistor model [4].

We thought then to reuse the same HIR model in the power BJT and PIN diode models as the physical phenomena are the same.

In fact the one-dimension HIR (figure 1 )  is govemed by the ambipolar difision equation (1) with the boundary conditions (2) and (3).

where t is the time variable, and x the geometrical variable, p(t,x) is the hole concentration (minority carriers), a(t), b(t) are the HIR boundary abscissa, r(x) is the net doping concentration, pn and pp are the carrier mobility, D is the ambipolar diffusion coefficient, A is the HIR active area, i(t) is the total current crossing the HIR, i (t,a), ip(t,b) are the minority carrier (hole) currents at the #IR boundaries  The equation set ( I )  to (3) is :;IC same for the PIN diode and the bipolar transistor The only differences are to be found in the variable values introduced in the boundary equations p(a), p(b), a, b, ip(a), ip(b) and i Thus if we build a HIR model where the external environment is represented by the latter variables, we will obtain a reusable HR model for the case of the PIN diode and the bipolar transistor We just have seen how the H R  model external variable choice is important if the model is to be reusable  This paper deals with the main rules to be applied in order to obtain modular and reusable basic semiconductor region models (section 2) The section 3 covers the space charge region model description using the Pacte software M++ language Pertinent results are presented in the section IV  I1 - "HE MODULAR MODELLING BASIC RULES  THE BASIC SEMICONDUCTOR REGIONS  We have seen that a HIR is present both in the PtN diode, in the power bipolar transistor and generally in all bipolar power devices The HIR has been enlighten applying the regional hypothesis that is a classical hypothesis in semiconductor device modelling.

In fact the semiconductor equations - the Poisson equation, the hole and electron transport equations - do not have the same importance in the different regions of a semiconductor device. One lonely main physical phenomenon may often be observed in any given region of the device.

Then we may list easily the usual basic semiconductor regions (BSRs) where only one physical phenomenon is acting [9] (table 1 )     I carriers concentration carriers concentration ambipolar diffusion ambipolar diffusion tabk. I the main typo of behavmur msrtJe the bipolar power semiconductor devices  enemflow flow variable eleclric current, i hydraulic (related to volume flow  In order to avoid sign error in the BSR model equations, we may notice that it is advised to consider minority and majority carriers instead of holes and electrons.

TIE EXTERNAL VARIABLES  Once all the BSRs have been defined, the model external variables have to be specified as we have seen before for the HIR. But we want that the association of the BSR models keeps as simple as a game. So we must limit the number of the external variables. Moreover it is suitable to choose one list for all the BSR models.

As a guide for the latter choice, we have examined the main methods of model association, that is to say the methods yielding the equation set of a given system.

Three main methods are to be considered. The most classical is the nodal method (Kirchhoff network) that describes the connections between all the components of a network. This method is used in Spice and Saber. An other important method is the block diagram description. It explicitly defines the direction of the information flows what does not perform the nodal method.

The block diagram description is used in Automatics and Mechanics.

Numerous softwares accept this system description input format : Tutsim, Matlab, Acsl  The bond graph techniques is described in [IO].  But as this method is not usual in electronics, we think important to recall same main points  Born 30 years ago, this method wants to take the advantages of the two former methods and to unify the description of the dynamic behaviour of any physical system. It is a network-like method but it is also a causal method as it comprises the system causality analysis that states out the direction of the information flows. The bond graph technique underlying idea is to represent a physical system from the energy viewpoint The power characterising the energy is expressed as the product of aflow-variahle and an e@rt variable.

In the case of the semiconductor device, the energy flows are linked to the free camer transports. The potential energy flow is the electric energy (current, voltage) The carrier kinetic energy is mostly the hydraulic energy flow (volume flow, pressure), with the ideal gaz hydrodynamic hypothesis.

The table 2 lists the flow variable and the effort variable which product characterises the power associated to the two former energy flows  Finally we think that the bond graph technique [ IO]  is the most efficient method in the case of our modelling problem  [111.

MOVING Bor   ARES  It appears as an evidence that care must be taken in the model derivation because of the semiconductor region moving boundaries  THE BASIC SEMICONDIJCTOK REGION MODEL PAKAh4ETERS  Consequently the BSR model parameters should be the parameters representing the main physical phenomonon in the BSR The table 3  lists the region main parameters.

It may be noted that there are very few parameters compared to the electrical parameters of the classical equivalent circuit models But their identification is not simple The technological parameter identification is out of the scope of this paper but details may be found in [ 131.

A state-variable model is an Algebraic and Ordinary Differential Equation set. We may add that the bond graph analysis of a physical system Ieads to a state-variable representation of the different components of the system. In fact a state-variable model takes care of the memory effect inside a system basic component. This memory effect is always associated to an energy storage.

So a physical system bond graph should represent the energy flows between the system basic components while the basic component state-variable model should describe the energy storage inside the component.

TIE CHANGE IN 'THE MODEL CAUSALITY  We take the example of the minority carrier current i,(t,a) at one boundary of the HIR in order to illustrate the change in the HIR model causality. (Note that the holes are now considered as the minority carriers, in order to ensure the model use in the case of a N-doped or a P-doped HR). The question is to point out which BSR is in charge of the minority carrier current im(t,a) value computation.

When the HIR exists and is in the saturation case (figure Z), the minority carrier current im(t,a) is easily derived from the total current and the current associated to the minority carrier recombination in the P+ lateral layer.

The notions of on-state and off-state are classical when dealing with a switch.

We now take the example of the space charge region that shows a drastic change in its behaviour.

In the classical depletion state (figure 4) the space charge region shows a capacitive behaviour. There is an equivalent storage of electrostatic charges of opposite sign The Poisson equation then yields the relation between this storage charge and the total voltage droo at the boundaries of the region. A simple charge balance gives  A bond graph describes the system dynamic behaviour while a Petri net describes the system functional behaviour.

We have already shown [ 1 I ]  that the two coupled techniques enable to spare a high amount of simulation CPU time. The table 4 sums up the result of same comparisons between Saber v3.2 and Pacte v0.9.1  The next section covers the space charge region model description using the Pacte Mt+ language. We may say immediately that the translation between the Pacte M++ language and the Saber Mast language is easy when dealing with a one-state model. Of course the translation is not possible in the case of multi-states model as Saber does not support the dynamic model switching process It is worth noting that Pacte enables to cut down the simulation time only thanks to the original methods used at the modelling and simulation levels compared to Saber that is a full mature product from computer-science viewpoint.

thestate-equation of this BSR model.

When a HIR exists at one boundary of the space charge region (fibwre 5), the region is drastically narrowed and its behaviour becomes complex to describe. There is a large interaction between the Poisson equation and the transport equations. But the space charge region has a very small influence on the power device general behaviour Then this space charge region can be neglected with a good approximation.

The basic region model is then reduced to the continuity of the external variables between the two lateral regions.

The next section explains how it can be taken a large advantage of the changes in the BSR behaviour or in their model causality.

___- THE DYNAMIC' MODEL SWITCHING  As there are changes both in the BSR behaviours and in their model causality, an idea is to write as many state-variable models as there are changes. Concerning a given BSR there will be as many models as the region shows different behaviours.

Then the idea is to change the region model dynamically during the simulation according to the system global state. The time-moment when the model switching appears, depends on the validation of transitions between the different models.

We have proposed the Petri net technique [9, 111 to manage the dynamic model switching. Broadly speaking this technique replaces all the conditional "if .. then .. else" structure of classical representation by state transitions.

The bonds uD and ue do not transfer energy, they are geometrical bond that carry the information "region geometrical boundaries".

As described there-above the space charge region presents a change in its behaviour that leads to a Petri net with three places describing : the depletion state, the non-existing state and a static state that eases the global system simulation initial point computation.

a 0  b _. - figure 6 : the space charge region model symbol and its Petri net  In the space charge region (figure 6a) the depletion hypothesis enables to separate the Poisson equation and the transport equations.

The depletion layer extends from the abscissa a in the diffused P+ layer to the abscissa b in the low-doped epitaxial layer. The doping profile is approximated by (4). The electric field value at the left boundary yields one boundary condition (5)  where XD is equal to +1 in the case of a P+N junction and -1 in the case of a N+P junction, fD defines the doping gradient in the diffused layer near the junction, ur =k.  T is the thermal voltage,  N is the epitaxial layer uniform doping concentration /4  The problem is then normalised with respect to the value xD The abscissas become (Y and 0, the geometrical variable becomes y and the electric field becomes eh) The normalised doping profile is y(y) and we define the undmensional value r The Poisson equation yields (6)  If the following primitive h a i o n s  of yb) are noted Hh)  and I&)), then the Gauss Theorem gives (7) and the total barrier height is computed as (8).

Finally the First Law of the Thermodynamics gives the model state equation. It is only a charge balance equation in one-half of the space charge region, for example between U and 0 (9). QD is the model state-variable.

The Pacte M++ language syntax is closed to the C++ syntax Then it enables to describe the space charge region model as a class (see next page and Object Oriented Programming formalism).

The model description fie begins by the declaration of the model Dej (class ) with the list of ports, the list of states, the constructor and the list of local variables. We draw the reader attention about the dimension analysis that prevents a lot of errors.

One important file is "physics.u" that collects all the physical dimensions with their IS0 unit or usual units.

The port list describes the model bonds, then it readily defines the model external variable. Each port declaration includes the statement of an energy type, and the external variable (flow and effort) names The following section concerns the constructor with the list of parameters and the computation of the local variables. The different states are described one &er one.

The declaration of a state includes the name of the state variables (only one in the present case). The equation of a state are sequential equations (using the sign =), causality equations (computation of the external variables : the voltage drop, the region abscissas, minority or majority carrier concentrations . . .), and implicit or state-equations (using the sign ==). The condition that validates a transition to another stute is written explicitly through a "if .." structure  The figure 7 pictures the other BSR model symbols. All the symbols show the same 4 kinds of port (where are connected the bonds) : majority and minority carrier hydraulic energy bonds, electrical energy bonds and geometrical bonds.

The reader may note for example that the power MOS transistor model includes naturally the internal body diode that is sometimes used in power converters (figure 12b).

At t=37ns, a signifcant space charge region appears and validates a transition to the state "recovery" of the PIN diode model. At t=90ns, the high-level injection hypothesis stops to be valid and the PIN diode model enters the state "transientoff.

The evolution of the high-level injection region boundaries are plotted in the bottom of figure 13. The HIR model gives also an accurate approximation of the minority carrier concentration evolution as shown in figure 14. These information are not readily useful for a circuit design engineer, but enable a practical evaluation of the HIR model in comparison with device simulators.
