1 Introduction Association rule mining is one of the important tasks of data mining intended towards decision support, which is to mining for relevant rules between items in large databases of sales transactions [l]. The results have been proven to be very useful for enterprises striving to enhance their competitiveness and profitability.

A number of algorithms have been developed for searching these rules. One of the main challenges in mining association rules is developing fast and efficient algorithms that can handle large volumes of data, hecause most association rule algorithms perform computations over entire databases, which frequently are very large. Han et al. proposed a topdown method, which investigates into the data deeply, for efficient mining of multiple..level association rules from large transaction databases based on the Apriori principle [Z]. Savasere et al. proposed the partition algorithm to further improve efficiency, sin.ce it effectively reduces the number of database scans; however, this algorithm wastes significant time scanning Jun Ma Institute of Artificial Intelligence Zhejiang University Hangzhoy Zhejiang, China vivienmajun@yahooxom.cn infrequent candidate item sets [3]. Additionally, Toivonen proposed a sampling algorithm, which requires just a single database scan, but still wastes considerable time on candidate item sets [4]. These algorithms all have their limitations. In this paper, an algorithm called RSASM is proposed for mining of association rules with rough set technology It can be seen the algorithm is effective to settle with some problems.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2, briefly describes the basis concepts of association rules mining; Section 3, presents the fundamental concepts of rough set theory used in the RSASM, Section 4, introduces the RSASM algorithm for mining of singledimensional association rules with rough set; subsequently, Section 5  discusses the expansion of RSASM to multidimensional association rules mining; finally, Section 6 presents conclusions.

2 Basic concepts of association rules mining Let I = {i , , i2; . . , im] be a set of items. Let W ,  the    Let I = {i , , i2; . . , im] be a set of items. Let W ,  the task-relevant data, be a set of database transactions where each transaction T is a set of items such that T CI. Let A be a set of items. A transaction T is said to contain A if and only if A S  T . An associufion rule is an implication of the form R: A +  B , where A c  I , B c 1 , a n d  A n B = @ . T h e r u l e  R : A + B  holdsin the transaction set w with support s ,  where s is the percentage of transactions in W that contain AU B .

This is taken to be the probability P ( A U B ) .  The rule R : A +  B has confidence c in the transaction set W if c is the percentage of transactions in W containing A that also contain B .  This is taken to be the conditional probability, P (  B I A) . Rules that satisfy both a minimum support threshold binsupp) and a minimum confidence ' 0-7803-8566-7/04/$20.00 0 2004 IEEE.

threshold (minconfl are calledsirong rules. The purpose of association rules mining is that generating strong association rules from all frequent itemsets.

Considering such information that customer who purchases milks also tend to buy bread at the same time is represented in association rule below: buys("milks")? buys("bread") [s=2%, c=75%] It is a singledimensional association rule since it refers to only one dimension, buys. If a rule references two or more dimensions, such as the dimensions buys, age, sex and income, then it is a multidimensional association rule, such as: age("20-29")? sex("female")? inmme("3K-5R') ?

huysr'faddish journal monthly") [s=l%, c=60%] A set of items is referred to as an itemset. An itemset that contains k items is a k -itemset. The occurrences frequency of an itemset is the number of transactions that contain the itemset. This is also known as the frequency, support count, or count of the itemset. An itemset satisfies minimum support if the occurrence frequency of the itemset is greater than or equal to the product of minsupp and the total number of transactions in w. The number of transactions required for the itemset to satisfy minimum support is therefore referred to as the minimum support count. If an itemset satisfies minimum support, then it is a frequent itemsei. The set of frequent k -itemsets is commonly denoted by Lk [I].

Conventional Apriori-like leve!-wise association rules for identifying the set of all frequent itemsets process in a combination of smaller frequent itemsets [5-81. In the k th level, the algorithm identifies all frequent k -itemsets, and ck represents the set of candidate k -itemsets obtained 6om Lk-, that is, potentially frequent k -itemsets. For each transaction in W , the candidate k -itemsets in ck also contained in the transaction are determined and their support count in increased by I .  Following reading and contrasting with the entire W , if their supports are greater than or equal to minsupp, the candidate k - itemsets immediately become the frequent k -itemsets. At the end of level k all frequent itemsets of length k or less have been discovered. During the excution, numerous candidate itemsets also needs to perform contrasts with the entire database, level by level, while discovering large itemsets. However, performance is significantly affected, because the database is read again and again, to constrast each candidate itemset with all transaction records of the database.

One limitation of these algorithms is the encoding scheme where separate symbols are used for each possible value of an attribute. This encoding scheme may he suitable for encoding the categorical valued attributes, but not for encoding the numerical valued attributes as they may have different values in every record. To avoid this situation, some ranges of values may be defined, which will create yet another problem, as the range of different    will create yet another problem, as the range of different attributes may he different.

3 Fundamental concepts of rough set theory Much attention has been paid recently by the expert systems research and machine learning community to the acquisition of knowledge and reasoning under vagueness and incompleteness. One way to deal witb uncertainty is to use fuzzylogic; the basic tools of the theory are possibility measures, which can be used on mining of fuzzy association rules, described by the natural language suited for the thinking ofhuman subjects and help to increase the flexibility for supporting users in making decisions [9, IO].

In 1982, Z. Pawlak [ l l ]  introduced a new tool to deal with vagueness, called the "rough set". Fuzzy set theory and rough set theory are independent and offer altemative approaches to uncertainty, as was shown in [12]. The main advantage of rough set theory is that it does not need any preliminary or additional information about data. Other advantages of the rough set approach include its ease of handling and its simple algorithms.

The rough set philosophy is based on the idea of classification. The most important issue addressed in the rough set theory is the idea of imprecise knowledge.

3.1 Information system BY an information system S, ~ = ( u , ~ t , V , f )  , where U isafinitesetofobjects, u = { x l , x 2 , . . . , x n )  , At is a finite set of attributes, the attributes in At is further classified into two disjoint subsets, condition attributes c and decision attributes D , At  = C u  D .

v = U vp , and vp is a domain of attribute p .

f :U x A t  + V is a total function such that f ( x i , q )  E V ,  forevery q ? A t ,  xi E U .

F A 3.2 Indiscernibility relation Let B A t ,  x i , x j  E U . Defme a binary relation IND , called an indiscemibility relation, as follow: I N D = { ( X ~ . X , ) E U  2 : (1) for every p ~ ~ ~ ~ , p ( x ~ ) = p ( x , ) } It can be said that xi and x j  are indiscemible by a set of attributes B in s if and only if p (x, ) = p ( x ,  ) for every p E B . One can check that IND is an equivalence relation on U for every B .4t .

Equivalence classes of relations are called elementary sets in s. For any element xi of U ,  the equivalence class of Xi in relation B is represented as [ An information system provides information about the real-world objects. However, information about objects may not be sufficient to characterize objects without ambiguity. Thus some objects are characterized by the same condition values. Two objects are indiscernible whenever they have the same values for all conditions.

Some selected features represented by attributes can  characterize objects. In general, information about objects expressed in this way is not sufficient to characterize objects uniquely, as any two objects are indistinguisliable from one another whenever the assume the same values for all the attributes under consideration. But it can be used to find association rules.

4 Mining of single-dimensional association rules The transaction database can be seen as a basic information system if it is simple, that is the relations involving in the transaction database is only one dimension or predicate, where each transaction in W is treated as an object, and each item in I is treated .as an attribute. Correspondingly, each attribute value in tbe system is the specific quantity of one item, which can be a numerical value or given categorical value.

numerical value or given categorical value.

For mining of singledimensional association rules, an algorithm called RSASM is introduced. The transz.ction database is generalized with concept hierarchies at first to obtain a generalization relation, where those quantitative values can he discretized as some categorical values on behalf of certain range, and the database will be reduced subsequently. Then the form of the generalized information system is changed to that each attribute in the new database is an exact value of one item in original system, and each attribute value is either 1 or 0, expressing that the occurrence of tbe given item value or not. For the new information system, the searching of frequent itemsets is easy based on the concept of equivalence class and minium transaction frequent.

4.1 Database Generalization The actual attribute of items in transaction database may be categorical or quantitative, which always have an implicit ordering among values. It is not necessary to mining rules with these complex data, thus discretization technique can be used to reduce the number of values for a given continuous attribute, where concept hierarchies is a good selection. On the other hand, the actual transaction database is huge with lots of redundant objects, and part of transactions is exiguous, which can be ignored or be amalgamated to settle in rule mining. So the original database can be generalized with concept hierarchies for object reduction. The generalization algorithm of the RSASM used is shown below.

Inputs: tbe database Wwith attribute sets I ; the set of concept hierarchies H ,  H, E H is the concept hierarchies of i j  E that can be generalized; the threshold t j  of each i, , and the support p (0 &lt; p 5 I), which reflects the percentage of objects supporting the generalization in the database.

Output: the generalized systems W'.

Procedure: 1. Let W' = W , define numbers of the maximal objects as p X c a r d ( W )  , where card(.) is the cardinality; 2. Calculate the numbers of attribute values d, for each attribute ij ; 3. Select the attribute r, with the maximal d j / t ,  . If the attribute can be generalized, tbe concept hierarchy of i, in H j  is promoted, and the values of i, in W' are substituted according to H,. Otherwise, the attribute i, is deleted from W '  ; 4. Delete the iterated objects, but record its number that will be used when computing confidence, and compute d, again for eachattribute i,; 5. If curd (W') 2 maximal objects, and 3dj &gt; t, , then go back to step 3 for computing continually.

4.2 Mining of candidate itemsets After the generalization of transaction database, the form of the generalized information system W '  should be changed for mining rules. In the new information system W " ,  the object is each transaction T , each attribute is one of exact attribute value vk of one certain item i, , k =I;..,dj, and all values of all items is arranged one after another as the set of attributes. So in W " ,  the numbers of objects is also card (w) , the numbers of attributes is Ed, , i, E I ,  j = 1;..,m. For one given item i, , if it occurs with the value vk in the transaction T , the corresponding value of the attribute ( i ,  ,vk) in W"is 1, expressing the occurrence of ( i j , v k )  in the given transaction; otherwise, the value is 0.

'I Thus, W" can be divided as equivalence class by that if the itemset occurs or not. For the itemsets A,., partitioning W" with the occurrence of 4: Y'' is the transaction set including 4 , the    Y'' is the transaction set including 4 , the occurrence frequency of A, is curd ( y ' )  , and the support s =curd (y:')/card (W") . If there is s &gt; minsupp, A, is a frequent itemsets, The searching method for candidate itemsets is similar to Apriori algorithm. The candidate ( k + l )  ~ itemsets can he generated from candidate k -itemsets, and any subset of one candidate itemsets is a candidate itemsets too. Let A, and A, are all candidate k -itemsets, for a given item a E 4 and a G A, , a candidate (k+ l )  -itemsets can he obtained as { a u  A,) , the partitioning of W" by it is: w'/{. U A,) = {{q' A w;) ,{ W *  - y' A (3) Y'AT: is the transaction set that include candidate (k+ l )  -itemsets. It will be a frequent ( k + l )  - itemsets if card (y' A ?')/card (W' ) 2 minsupp.

The frequent (k+  1) -itemsets can be generated directly from candidate (k+ 1) -itemsets without searching W" , so the method search through the database only once, which will decrease the time for rule mining obviously.

4.3 Mining of frequent itemsets One of elements in mining of association rules is defming the threshold of minimum support. Most of the forthcoming algorithms are only defining one threshold of minimum support, which means each item and each item value has the same occurrence frequency. It is not fact, some items may occur frequently than the others. In this method multiple thresholds of minimum support are used, by referencing [SI. For each item i,with certain value vk , define a minimum transaction frequent as MF ( 5 ,  vk) , = 1. In a given transaction the value of k=l one item is unique, so that the specific value V ,  can be ignored in the definition of minimum transaction frequent.

The minimum transaction frequent of item i, is described as m(i,).

For the candidate itemsets A,, let association rule R : i , ; . . , i , - , i , + , , . . . , i , ,  V i j # i k ,  j , k ~ ( l ; . . , r ) , i,;..,i, EA,, r=ca rd (4 . ) , t he rewi l lhe : The minimum transaction frequent of each item i, is defined by its occurrence frequency, and the items including in each rule decide the minsupp value of it. Thus the minsupp value is indeedmultiple and not one.

4.4 Mining of association rules The mining of association rules is usually a two phases process. The first phase is for frequent itemsets generation. The second phase generates the rules using another userdefined parameter minconJ which angain affects the generation of rules. The second phase is easier and the overall performance of mining association d e s  is determined mainly by the first step.

4.5 Experimental results To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed meihod, the RSASM, along with the Apriori algorithm, is implemented at the same condition. The test database is downloaded kom UCI repository [13].

1000,2000,5000,10000,20000 and 50000 transactions of experimental data are randomly sampled kom the original database. The test database contains 1000 items, and the average transaction record contains 6 items. The minimum support of Apriori algorithm is 0.45%, and the computation times and the numbers of frequent iternsets found by the two algorithms are shown in Figure 1.

Performance of RSASM and Apriori algorithm on the various amounts of items The experimental results in Figure 1 and Figure 2 show that the RSASM performs batter and more rapid than the Apriori algorithm. The RSASM is not only eliminating considerable amounts of data, but also decreasing the numbers of database scanning, thus reducing the computation quantities to perform data constrasts and also memory requirements. With the multiple minimum supports, the numbers of frequent itemsets is sententious than that of the Apriori algorithm with small minimum support.

5 Mining of multidimensional association rules As that can be seen, mining of association rules is applied mainly on transaction database. An interesting fact in transaction database is that, if mining single- dimensional association rules, the dimension will always be buys; if mining multidimensional association rules, buys are always the consequent part of the rules too. No matter which situation, the dimension of buys is the main part for constituting the association rules.

Look back the example mentioned above: age(Y0-29")? sex("female")? incomer3K-SK") ?

buysrfaddish journal monthly") This is a multidimensional association rule with four dimensions, it can be seen that the other dimensions are simpler than that of buys. The contents of buys is constituted by a variety of items, it may be gocery or commodity, that is, the dimension buys can be subdivided as different category. Only the dimension buys can come into being an information system with transactions as rows and items as columns as that discussed in Section 4. The other dimension such as age, sex, or income is simple and unnecessary to subdivide, which can be added directly into the information system as one certain attribute, it will only posses one column in the information system, analogous an item. So if mining multidimensional association rules, transform the original transaction databases into appropriate form of information system, the mining process with the RSASM algorithm is same as minimg of singledimensional association rules. If the attribute is quantitative, it is discretized using predefined concept hierarchies as shown in section 4.1, then it can be treated as categorical attribute for further mining. This part is similar to the algorithm that mining multidimensional association rules using discretization of quantitative attributes shown in [l], hut the sets of attrihute is mixed together for mining, the results will be a mixed rule sets with multidimensional and singledimensional association rules together. Because of the efficiency of RSASM, the reduction of computation time and numbers of frequent itemsets can be foresighted.

6 Conclusions An efficient algorithm for identifymg the frequent itemsets can he useful in various data mining problems, such as the discovery of the association rules. In this paper, the RSASM is proposed to mining single- dimensional and multidimensional association rules.

Mining rules with the RSASM algorithm is a multi-step process: generalizing database to discretize quantitative attributes and decrease quantity of data at first, then finding candidate itemsets with the concept of equivalence    finding candidate itemsets with the concept of equivalence class, next finding frequent itemsets with multiple minimum supports. The algorithm provides better performance improvements. The gap hetween the RSASM and Apriori algorithms becomes evident with the number and size of pattems identified and the searching time reduced. At the posterior part of the paper, it discusses that RSASM algorithm can be expanded to mining of multidimensional association rules simply, with transform the database into appropriate form, detailed situation will he researched further.
