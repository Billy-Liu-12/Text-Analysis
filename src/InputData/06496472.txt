I. INTRODUCTION Data mining is a knowledge discovery process of analysing large databases to find useful patterns. It has numerous applications such as marketing, business, medical analysis, product control, engineering design, bioinformatics and scientific exploration, etc. The knowledge discovered from a database can be expressed in patterns such as decision trees, clusters or association rules.  Retail shops are interested in associations between different items that customer place in the shopping basket. By discovering interesting association rules, an organization can identify underlying patterns useful in planning of new store layout, new product assortments and which product to put on promotion. The knowledge discovered can be beneficial to business competitors. In order to preserve their competitive edge some partners may hesitate to disclose sensitive information and also to prevent data mining techniques from discovering sensitive knowledge which is not even known to the database owners.

Privacy preserving data mining is a broad research area for protecting sensitive data or knowledge [2]. There have been two types of privacy concerning data mining. The first type of privacy, called output privacy, is that preventing the mining output from malicious inference attacks [4]. The second type of privacy, input privacy, is that sanitizing the raw data itself before performing mining [5]. The framework of privacy preserving data mining is shown in Fig 1.

In market basket databases, the sensitive association rule must be hidden for competency. Many algorithms have been proposed for hiding sensitive association rules. These algorithms have been given some set of sensitive items manually. The market basket database contains large number of items. Selection of sensitive items manually from market basket database takes more time.

In the proposed method, representative association rules are computed from association rules. Based on the discovered rules sensitive items are selected for privacy preserving.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives the view of the market basket analysis using association rule mining strategy. Section 3 describes association rule mining algorithms. Section 4 presents the problem statement.  Section 5 analyses the theoretical background and related work.

Concluding remarks and future work are described in Section 8.

II. MARKET BASKET ANALYSIS USING ASSOCIATION RULE MINING STRATEGY  The term market basket analysis using association rule learning in the retail business refers to the research that provides the retailer with information to understand the purchasing behavior of a customer. This association information will enable the retailer to understand the customer's needs and rewrite the store's layout accordingly, develop cross-promotional programs, or even capture new customers. An example for this was when one super market chain discovered in its analysis that customers who bought diapers often bought beer as well, have put the diapers close to beer coolers, and their sales increased dramatically.

Let I = {i1,?., in} be a set of items. Let D be a database which contains set of transactions. Each transaction t ? D is an item set such that t is a proper subset of I. A transaction t supports X, a set of items in I, if X is a proper subset of t.

Assume that the items in a transaction or an item set are sorted in lexicographic order. An association rule is an implication of the form  , where X and Y are subsets of I and X?Y= ?.

following equation:    _______  |D|  where |X the itemset XY in the database, |D| denotes the number of the transactions in the data.

________  |X|  where |X| is number of transactions in database D that contains itemset X.

and min_confidence are two given minimum thresholds.



III. ASSOCIATION RULE MINING ALGORITHMS The algorithms for discovering large itemsets make multiple passes over the data. In the first pass, the algorithm counts the support of individual items and determines which of them are large, i.e. have minimum support. In each subsequent pass, it starts with a seed set of itemsets found to be large in the previous pass. This seed set is used for generating new potentially large itemsets, called candidate itemsets, and count the actual support for these candidate itemsets during the pass over the data. At the end of the pass, it determines which of the candidate itemsets are actually large, and they become the seed for the next pass. This process continues until no new large itemsets are found. Many  algorithms for generating association rules were presented over time. Some well known algorithms are Apriori, Eclat and FP-Growth. Apriori is the best-known algorithm to mine association rules. It uses a breadth-first search strategy to count the support of itemsets and uses a candidate generation function which exploits the downward closure property of support.

A. Apriori Algorithm  Agrawal et al [1] has presented the first association rule mining algorithm and is named as Apriori algorithm. The algorithm is based on the a priori hypothesis, viz., an itemset can only be frequent if all its subsets are also frequent. This information makes possible to reduce the search space efficiently when discovering the frequent itemsets, because using this information reduces the number of candidates. The Apriori algorithm is a level-wise method, which means that it discovers the k-itemsets during kth database scan. The algorithm counts the items in the transactions and discards the infrequent items in the first scan of the database. In this way the frequent 1-itemsets are found. From these frequent items two candidates are generated by creating all the combination of them by keeping the lexicographic order.

Formally, items x and y form a candidate (x,y) when x ? y.

During the, second database scan the support of the 2- candidates are counted. After a database reading, the counters of the candidates are checked with the minimum support threshold. If a counter exceeds the threshold, the candidate belonging to it becomes frequent, otherwise it is discarded. The 3-candidates are generated from the frequent 2-itemsets regarding the following rule.

Let be given two itemsets (i1,i2) and (i3,i4) where i1<i2 and i3<i4 as mentioned earlier. The two itemsets can form a 3-candidate if i1=i3 and (i2,i4) is also frequent. Fulfilling the second condition means that the a priori hypothesis is fulfilled. The resulting 3-candidate is the following: (i1,i2,i4).

In general two k-itemsets are joined by keeping the lexicographic order to form a (k + 1)-itemset if the first k-1 items of them are in common and all the (k-1)-subsets of the resulting candidate are frequent. The algorithm terminates if no candidates can be generated or no frequent itemsets are found.



IV. PROBLEM STATEMENT Data mining represents a wide range of tools and techniques to extract useful information which can contain sensitive information from a large collection of data. Data should be manipulated or distorted in such a way that information cannot be discovered through data mining techniques. Sensitive information has to be protected against unauthorized access. Privacy preserving data mining considers the problem of data mining. Association rule hiding is one of the privacy preserving techniques for hiding sensitive association rules. For hiding sensitive association information in market basket database the sensitive items are given as input.  Detection of sensitive items manually in market basket database containing thousands of transactions takes more computational time. So there is a need to find a method to detect the sensitive items.



V. RELATED WORKS  In [6], the authors hide the sensitive knowledge in association rule mining, by selecting the sensitive rules manually.

In [7] authors introduced a heuristic approach to hide restrictive association rules that requires the sensitive items.

The sensitive items have to be identified manually and it has to be removed from its transactions.

In [8], the authors selected the sensitive attributes and hide the attributes by randomization process.

In [9], the authors select the sensitive item(s) using the frequent item sets and the association rules. By selecting the consequent of the rule, the sensitive items can be identified.

Instead of selecting the sensitive items manually, the proposed method helps to detect the sensitive items.



VI. PROPOSED METHOD  The proposed method first finds the number of occurrences of individual items. Using maximum number of frequent items, association rules are generated based on minimum support and minimum confidence. This approach uses the concept of representative rules. Having the frequent items on LHS of the rule, its consequents are combined in RHS. The consequents are selected as sensitive items. More number of sensitive items are selected by varying minimum support and minimum confidence, which are user specified values.

A. Representative Association Rule  The number of association rules discovered in a given database is very large. It is noted that a significant percentage of these rules are redundant and useless. A user should be presented with all of them, which are original, novel, and interesting. To address this issue, [10] introduced a notion for concise representation of association rules, called representative rules (RR).

RR is a least set of rules that allow deducing all association rules without accessing a database. In a notion of cover operator was introduced for driving a set of association rules from a given association rule. The cover of the rule X , is defined as follows:  Y Y and Z V and V  C Y consists of a subset of items occurring in the rule X Y. The number of different rules in the cover of the association  X Y is equal to .

In general, the process of generating representative rules may be decomposed in to two sub processes: frequent item- sets generations and generation of RR from frequent item-sets.

Let be a frequent itemset and X Y . The association rule X  representative rule if there is no association rule  ? ? where  Z ?, and there is no association rule  ? ? such that X X ?. Formally, a set of representative rules (RR) for a given association rules (AR) can be defined as follows:   R r? AR  r ? r and r C ?  Each rule in RR is called representative association rule and no representative rule may belong in the cover of another association rule [11], [12].

Algorithm: Detection of Sensitive Items Input: (1) Database D (2) Minimum support: min_supp (3) Minimum confidence: min_conf Output: Sensitive item(s) for Sensitive Association rule hiding.

Algorithm:  1. Find the frequencies of individual items and store it in F.

2. Generate the association rules from D using minimum support and minimum confidence.

3. Select the single antecedent and consequent rules.

4.  { 5. If F is empty then EXIT; 6. Select all the rules with min_supp containing f and  store in U//f  on LHS 7.  Repeat { 8.  Select all the rules from U with same LHS 9.  Join RHS of selected rules and store in R; //make  them representative rules 10.  }Until (U is empty);  11. Selected RHS will be the sensitive item(s).

Maximum occurrences of items are selected by user specified value in terms of percentage. The proposed algorithm first tries to find the frequent items and the association rules are generated using the Apriori algorithm [1].

These rules are used to form representative association rules having frequent items on LHS. The selected RHS are considered as sensitive items. The selected sensitive items are used to hide sensitive rules.



VII.    EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS   TABLE I:   TRANSACTIONAL DATASET  TID ITEMS  T1 ABC  T2 ABCD  T3 BCE  T4 ACDE  T5 DE  T6 AB  Frequent items are selected based on the support of individual items. This is shown in Table-II.

TABLE II   FREQUENT ITEMS  Items No. Of Occurrences  A 4  B 4  C 4  D 3  E 3   For the Dataset given in Table - I min_supp is taken as 33% and a min_conf  is taken as 70 % and frequent item F={A}.

Association rules are generated using apriori algorithm.

The rules containing single antecedent and consequent are selected. All the rules containing ?A? either in RHS or LHS are chosen and represent them in representative rule format.

Association rules are shown in Table III.

TABLE III:  ASSOCIATION RULES  AR SUPP CONF A => C 50 75  C => A 50 75  A, D => C 33.333 100  C, D => A 33.333 100  A => B 50 75  B => A 50 75  C=>B 50 75  B=>C 50 75   From these association rules, the rules containing frequent item A with single antecedent and consequent are selected.

They are A=>C(50,75), C=>A(50,75), A,D=>C(33.33,100), C,D=> A(33,100), A=>B(50,75), B=>A(50, 75).

From this rules set, select the rules that can be represented in the form of representative rules. Like the rules A=>B and A=>C can be represented as  A=> BC  In the above representative rules B and C are considered as sensitive items. Similarly the frequent items B and C are taken and representative association rules are formed. From the representative association rules, sensitive item A is detected.

Hence, for the given transactional data set A, B and C are detected as sensitive items. More number of sensitive items can be selected by varying minimum support and minimum confidence of frequent items.



VIII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK Market basket analysis is an essential activity to promote business. Buyer behavior patterns are discovered through market basket analysis. The knowledge discovered may reveal trade secrets also. The data owner may lose his business secrets. Privacy preserving data mining hides certain sensitive  information, so that they cannot be discovered through data mining techniques.

Association rule hiding algorithm sanitizes the database such that no sensitive association rule is derived from it. For hiding sensitive association rules, sensitive items are selected manually. In market basket database the selection of sensitive items takes more computational time.

The proposed algorithm detects the sensitive items using a set of representative association rules. It is experimented with sample data sets. Further research work is in progress to hide the sensitive association rules using the selected sensitive items.
