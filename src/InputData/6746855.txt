Big Data and NSA Surveillance - Survey of Technology and Legal Issues

Abstract? As technology for data storage and computing enhances on a new dimension, real world evidence based decision has become possible, and a new concept called ?Big Data? has emerged. Leaders for Big Data technology development are mainly national security and medical field due to their urgent need of decision based on big data. Recent revelation of collection and analysis activities of National Security Agency (NSA) that cover massive data corresponding to the area of people?s privacy triggered much controversy about concerns for infringing privacy and violation of constitutional rights. This, in turn, became opportunity of producing various analysis and opinions about the current level of big data technology, future possibility, types of work that big data has enabled, and technological and legal means for preventing expected abuse. The purposes of this paper are surveying materials about legal issues regarding NSA?s activity with big data, and organizing feedbacks collected from various sources of the society.

I.  INTRODUCTION This paper describes legal issues for NSA?s activities  with big data on the aspects of general concept for big data, legal issues surfaced by disclosure of NSA surveillance activities, cooperation of private enterprises and NSA according to common goals, technical and legal analysis of details for NSA?s activities based on publicized materials, and opinions regarding NSA surveillance activity.

Computer technology is being developed exponentially in the speed and size of data being processed. In addition, the Internet has increased the size of participants and therefore the data generated also exponentially. Big data is a technological result of the dramatic increase of data that describe the details of users? lives. [5] explains that Big data includes semi-structured and unstructured data, which include all types of unformatted data including multimedia and social media content. [10] explains that Big data, which are characterized by three Vs, Data Volume, Data Variety and Data Velocity, cannot be processed by traditional database tools. This resulted in development of new database tools like NoSQL, which is designed to capture all data without categorizing and parsing upon entry into the system.

In Section II, we survey Big Data and NSA surveillance activities. The conclusion is addressed in Section III.



II. Survey   A. Revelations regarding NSA?s extremely broad surveillance activity  Side effects of big data technology and possible abuse by those who have the big data have become issues especially from legal point of view, because such abuse is likely to infringe the rights of individuals and entities under surveillance.

[3] suggests direction for Big Data Governance based on lessons of the NSA PRISM Initiative. As the technology becomes powerful, more importance must be given on governance. In big data, there are huge unwanted data than the data wanted. Since huge data involves governance challenges including privacy, we must govern the unwanted data.  Metadata themselves may be the valuable big data, and therefore governance for metadata must be robust.

B.  Cooperation of NSA and private enterprises in big data area  While NSA?s surveillance activities are in vigorous controversy, government agencies and private enterprises have many common needs and closely cooperate up to subtle and complex technical levels. Big data is becoming more advantageous beyond the point of justifying the cost of required computer hardware, and social media lead the trend.

[8] explains that the interests of NSA and Silicon Valley began to converge as advances in computer storage technology drastically reduced the costs of storing enormous amounts of data and at the same time the value of the data for use in consumer marketing began to rise. On the other hand, social media sites are growing as voluntary data mining operations on a scale that rivals or exceeds anything the government could attempt on its own.

C. Analysis for current level of NSA?s technology There are many estimates for NSA?s current big data  technology level based on official and non-official disclosures.

[2] explains capabilities of NSA?s two key technologies, Accumulo and PRISM. Accumulo has multiple levels of security access allowing individual items within a row of data to have different classifications. Accumulo can generate near real-time reports from specific patterns in data. Data pumped out of Accumulo can be transferred to other analysis tools including graph applications. PRISM obtains access to the servers behind cloud services like gmail, facebook, and etc. and the user data within them, allowing them to bypass cracking SSL certificates and pull in the stored data directly.

PRISM also allows the NSA to implement surveillance of chosen subjects' live interactions through the service, including presence data, instant messaging, video and voice chat, and Voice over IP phone calls.

2013 IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia  DOI 10.1109/ISM.2013.103   2013 IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia  DOI 10.1109/ISM.2013.103     Accumulo [6] is able to take data and to stretch it in new ways so that you can find out how to associate it with another piece of data and find threats. The power of this capability is finding patterns in seemingly innocuous public network data, which is how one might describe the data accessed through the Prism program.

D. Analysis of current laws and rules regulating NSA activity  Though current laws are considered to change far behind the rapidly developing technology, detailed practical implementation to control government agencies? surveillance activities are explained.

[1] explains that NSA?s surveillance model is ?collection first? followed by minimization prior to use. Minimization is required because big data collects large data that might not have appeared necessary and extracts unpredictable value from combinations of collected data. Recent disclosures about NSA surveillance raise awareness of need for accountability for decision makers, processes and technology.

E.  Opinions for big data surveillance- optimistic view and pessimistic view Contrasting opinions from people in various fields reflect  the influence of big data technology.  Many problems are occurring due to the fact that the legal system cannot effectively catch up with the rapidly changing technology.

Institute for Human Rights and Business posted their view in [4], that while governments can suspend certain human rights during an emergency, they do not have blanket powers to impose such surveillance. The absence of effective checks and balances under FISA strongly suggest the Prism is unaccountable.

Both privacy advocates and security experts [7] agree that the laws governing electronic eavesdropping have not kept pace with technology. Unlike past surveillance methods, today?s fiber optic cable, which NSA can tap into, can transmit tens of thousands of communications with a single cable.  NSA can connect with those cables by obtaining secret court orders, and store collected data at a massive, new NSA facility in Utah. The size of data to be processed and stored is no longer a constraint due to technological advance.

Further, NSA can perform warrantless collection not to lose the trace of suspects, and amendments to the Patriot Act allow this collection of bulk data. Debate should be opened about Patriot Act to keep up with the technology.

The very concept of big data operation by NSA is in conflict with the Fourth Amendment protection against general warrants [9]. The government?s surveillance using big data is a classic case of why scale and quantity matter.

Phone metadata including number, number called, serial number of phone, location and duration may be used to deduce personal every day activity facts. The U.S.

government is prevented by law from becoming just such a big data operation, but so it has become. Warrants and non- warrant orders, including FISA orders, have to be particularized and narrow. But the revelation regarding NSA points to a larger pattern of surveillance is clearly beyond the  scope of what the government is constitutionally allowed.

This is a case of the government keeping up with technology and getting (way) ahead of the law. This situation reminds us that laws and regulations are not infinitely scalable. The cost of tracing each individual mail envelope to find a pattern is many orders of magnitude higher than the electronic effort of analyzing phone logs. But digital technology has evolved quickly without any real public discussion of new social contract. The threat of terrorism has coincided with the rise of methods for analyzing big data.



II. CONCLUSIONS Big data made social influence of computer technology  reach to maturity level. The day-to-day activities of all individuals are placed under the influence of computer technology even though the individuals are not aware of it.

Controversies regarding NSA surveillance activities exposed political, social and economic issues for computer technology, and became an opportunity for making the majority to recognize the need for understanding and controlling computer technology. Raising need for controlling big data use in activities of government represented by NSA, and private corporate activities represented by multinational companies, and suggesting solutions for the need would provide environment in which computer technology could improve in harmony with requirements of the society; reduce side effects due to abuse of technology, and help find the way for computer technology contribute to the mankind.
