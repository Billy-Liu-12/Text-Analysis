Using Open Source Modeling Tools To Enhance Engineering Analysis

Abstract -- There are several very capable open source  engineering analysis tools that a utility can use to assist in  solving engineering analysis problems. Applying these open  source applications, alongside a commercial engineering  analysis application, can be a very cost effective way for  utility engineers to solve problems presented by newer  technologies, such as Solar and Wind DG and PEV charging,  using the data they already have in their commercial  applications.

In this paper we will use GridLAB-D, OpenDSS, and  Milsoft's WindMil, to show examples of today's engineering  analysis problems that can be solved using open source and  commercial applications in concert with each other. The  purpose of the paper is to show what is possible, and what is  needed to use multiple analysis tools to solve more complex  analysis. The purpose of the paper is not, for example, to  complete a complex time series study on the affect of PV  generation on a distribution network, which could be a paper  on its own merit. The list below outlines some of the analysis  projects that can be done with this approach and we will  provide examples of at least two of them.

? Voltage Drop  ? Basic PV Analysis  ? Effects of voltage profiles for various times (peak wind/solar v. peak load v. off-peak)  ? Harmonics  ? Effects of EV charging  We will also outline the need for validated connectivity and  asset information as the foundation analysis in any tool  selected by the utility to accomplish their engineering analysis  tasks.

I. INTRODUCTION  Accurate, detailed modeling and analysis of the electric  distribution network is essential to provide the most  economical, safe, and reliable service to our communities.

There is not a single analysis tool that is capable of doing all  the analysis necessary to keep an electric distribution network  operating at peak efficiency. In addition, both the analysis  and models created by analysis systems have to be able to be  consumed on both the engineering and operational teams at  utilities. If there is not a common connectivity model, along  with asset data that can be shared with the analysis  applications, they cannot effectively work together. The cost  of acquiring this foundational data for any utility, along with  maintaining the data to keep an accurate connectivity and  asset database, is expensive. It is essential that the  connectivity and asset data be useable across the analysis  applications.

The analysis applications used in this paper are WindMil  from Milsoft Utility Solutions, Inc., GridLAB-D from PNNL,  and OpenDSS[l] from EPRI. WindMil manages the electric  distribution connectivity model, asset and equipment data.

We will show how to export the connectivity and asset data  into GridLAB-D and OpenDSS to perform other analysis that  WindMil does not.



II. OVERVIEW OF THE CIRCUIT BEING ANALYZED  We chose not use the IEEE feeders for this paper. We will  show a real utility electrical distribution network as an  example for this paper. We will use Sub A, Feeders 1 and 2,  located at Excelsior EMC and WindMil's connectivity model  and data. We will export the data using WindMil's interface  to GridLAB-D and OpenDSS and show that using the same  database source, the results match doing basic analysis on the  circuit. We will use GridLAB-D and OpenDSS to do further  analysis on the circuits.

Prior to export, the WindMil circuit model database contains all data and equipment settings required to accurately run unbalanced impedance and unbalanced loading load flow.

Regulators are configured in the voltage drop analysis to  use the step option. This option allows the regulators to be  modeled and simulated with their actual number of taps and  bandwidth, as well as regulator set-point and any active line  drop compensation settings.



III. WINDMIL, GRIDLAB-D, AND OPENDSS RESULTS - BASE CASE  In this section, the results from running the base case, as  entered into the WindMil distribution analysis software will  be compared to the results from GridLAB-D and OpenDSS.

Table I shows the active power flow at the substation from  each of the three distribution analysis software packages.

Reviewing the data in tables I, II, and III, the data export  from WindMil, using the OpenDSS and GridLAB-D export  function, shows the data originating from WindMil gives us  very close to the same result in all three applications. We  encourage utility engineers to go through this data validation  step to insure that the data and model being exported can be  used confidently in a study using GirdLab-D and OpenDSS.



IV. OPENDSS ANALYSTS  The base case model was exported by WindMil to  OpenDSS and shown to be valid (in OpenDSS) in Section III.

This section will show an analysis using the OpenDSS. The  analysis will utilize one PV arrays rated at 750 kW. The  inverter associated with the PV array is rated at 900 kW, or  1.2 times the Pmpp. The location of the PV is shown in Fig.

2.

Fig. 2. Circuit model showing location of the 750 kW PV  array.

The PV array is connected to the feeder via a 1000 kV A     interconnect transformer. The higher-voltage winding is  connected grounded-wye and the lower-voltage winding  (where the PV is connected) is connected delta.

This analysis is to determine the effects of changing from  no output to full output from each PV on the terminal  voltages and on the nearby primary voltage, as well as any  possible movement of voltage regulators. The terminal  voltage and the primary voltage, prior to any voltage regulator  action increased from 1.02 per-unit voltage to 1.04 per-unit  voltage.

Once the regulators were allowed to operate based on their  control settings, two regulators near the PV array changed  taps due to the change in voltage at the regulators due to the  change in PV output. A regulator on B phase and a regulator  on phase C moved two taps lower.

One approach to mitigating the effects of changes in PV  output is to use a smart-inverter function called volt-var  control[2,3]. Volt-var control uses a curve that defines the  reactive power output as a function of terminal voltage. An  example volt-var curve is shown in Fig. 3. Typically, the  curve is defined in a manner that generates capacitive vars  when the voltage is less than 1.0 per unit, to boost the voltage.

The curve typically is defined to generate inductive vars when  the voltage is greater than 1.0 per unit.

Percent Voltage  Fig. 3. Example volt-var curve.

By applying a smart inverter control that implements volt?  var control mode, we are able to reduce the voltage change  due to change in the PV active power output such that the  regulators do not change taps.

The volt-var control mode with volt-var curve results in  the generation of about 477 kvar, inductive. This is to counteract the voltage rise due to the active power output.

This is approximately 96% of the maximum reactive power  output that could be generated by the inverter with an active  power output of 7S0 kW and an inverter size of 900 kV A.



V. GRIDLAB-D ANALYSIS  The static load flow model was translated into the  GridLAB-D modeling language and modified by adding time?  series data. The time-series data can come from a number of  resources, from prototypical load shapes to AMI  measurements to public databases. In this model, the static  spot loads are replaced with a combination of load shapes  from a southern California utility and ELCAP load studies  [4][S] from a hot summer day. The peak load value aligns  with the static load flow model (2.3 MW) and represents a  primarily residential circuit. Static voltages at the swing node  were replaced with IS-minute time-series voltages measured  from a sub-transmission node. The substation load is shown  in Fig. 4.

In addition, a solar array is added at node o122S_n. It is  attached to the feeder via a three-phase WYE-WYE step?  down transformer (12.47 kV to 240 V) and includes a series  of inverter and solar panel models, which use solar irradiance  data to calculate power output [6]. An 800 kV A, 1000 kV A,  and 1200 kV A solar arrays are modeled. Modified solar  irradiance data for a partly cloudy day from NREL's  Measurement and Instrumentation Data Center is used to  determine the output of the solar plant [7]. Power factor is set  at unity. Fig. S shows the total solar power output of the 800  kVA case.

Transferring models between tools allows us to look at  different aspects of the problem. For example, Table 1 shows     a comparison of the daily real and reactive energy losses as a  function of the size of the solar plant and compares this to the  peak load flow loss study. The time-series model is better  able to capture the low- and medium-load effects, predicting a  4.5% reduction in losses when the 800 kW solar plant is  added. Some of the differences between the static model and  time-series model can be corrected by performing multiple  simulations at multiple load levels, however if data and  models can be easily transferred between tools, then this  becomes an unnecessary step and may provide better  solutions.

ReallReactive Losses  Another interesting side effect that can be observed is the  impact on the regulator nearest the solar array. The number  of tap changes observed increases by a significant amount (as  high as 4 times) between the no solar and 1200 kW case.

This could have a significant impact on cost of operation  and maintenance. With these types of models and the  addition of time-series data, reliable information can be  obtained about the effects and costs associated with the  installation of the array prior to installation.

VI. SUMMARY  The acqulSltlOn and maintenance of data is expensive.

Creating the ability for utilities to use the same data across  multiple software applications that enhances their engineering  capabilities is both foundational and powerful. It not only  maximizes the utilities investment in data that they have  collected in dollars, but the investment is further enhanced by  enabling engineers to accomplish analysis on technologies  such as solar and electric vehicles without having to recreate  or find the data to complete the analysis. Utilities can use the  best in class tools to solve problems.

We took three different applications, with the same model  and data from WindMil, and came up with the same analysis  results. All three applications have their strengths and  weaknesses when it comes to analysis, and all three  applications cannot operate without data. We look forward to  sharing more detailed analysis using this concept of data and  models interoperating between applications.
