Abstract - Biomedical data analytic system has played an  important role in doing the clinical diagnosis for several decades.

Today, it is an emerging research area of analyzing these big  data to make decision support for physicians. This paper  presents a parallelized web-based tool with cloud computing  service architecture to analyze the epilepsy. There are many  modern analytic functions which are wavelet transform, genetic  algorithm (GA), and support vector machine (SVM) cascaded in  the system. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the system, it has  been verified by two kinds of electroencephalography (EEG)  data, which are short term EEG and long term EEG. The results  reveal that our approach achieves the total classification  accuracy higher than 90%. In addition, the entire training time  accelerate about 4.66 times and prediction time is also meet  requirements in real time.



I. INTRODUCTION  LECTROCARDIOGRAM (ECG), Phonocardiogram  (PCG), and Electroencephalography (EEG) always  supply important health information of the patients for  physicians. The analysis of these biomedical data [1-3] is very  important for clinical research field with signal processing and  data mining. Techniques such as adaptive filtering, spectrum  estimation, compression, time series processing, feature  selection and pattern classification are used to analyze the  signals. As a result of improving the quality of care and  reducing the cost, physicians decided to use these intelligent  algorithms to provide a decision making system. Therefore,  biomedical data analytic system recently is developed as an  intelligent system to capture, transmit, calculate, and  distribute results to physicians and patients. In other words,  the system has been designed as a solution to make diagnosis  and to ensure the goal of automatic systems can be operated in  both a real-time and an interactive environment.

In general, seizures happen when clusters of  brain neurons signal abnormally, which may temporarily  cause anomaly in consciousness, behavior, movements, and  actions of the patients. One way to analyze epilepsy is through  recognizing EEG waveform of patients. EEG devices measure  voltage changes from ionic current flows within the neurons of  the brain [5], which shows temporal and spatial information of  the brain, and is useful in the diagnosis of epilepsy. In addition,  study [6] has also shown that EEG signals provide high  sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of epilepsy.

Recently, several studies [7-9] have proposed all kinds of  algorithms for epileptic seizures using EEG signals. If  successful, it would improve the quality of life and safety for  patients with epilepsy. Thus, real-time EEG forewarning  systems are emerging and necessary for seizure detection.

The web-based epilepsy analytic system (EAS) architecture  we proposed contains three major portions: the client site, the  server site and the database as depicted in Fig. 1. The client  site, which is accessed by physicians or healthcare  practitioners, provides a friendly graphical user interface to  interact with the server site and the database. Users from the  client site must get authentication from the server site via  session services to validate the security information stored in  database. At the server site, it is embedded all the  functionalities under the web services, such as data  preprocessing feature selection, feature extraction, and  classifier. The database stores medical data collected from  hospitals the National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) in  our approach. All components of the system use the extensible  markup language (XML) format for exchanging messages,  and the communication mechanism is based on a simple  object access protocol (SOAP) over HTTP handled internally  by the .NET environment [10-11]. In conclusion, users can  easily get the results from EAS.

Detailed descriptions of system components, data  preprocessing, features selection, and classifiers are  illustrated. In Section III, the system implementation is  described. The complete biomedical data analytic results are  provided in Section IV. Finally, the paper concludes in  Section V.



II. METHOD  A. Data Preprocessing  Infinite impulse response (IIR) is a property of signal  processing systems [12]. IIR systems have an impulse  response function that is non-zero over an infinite length of  time. This is in contrast to finite impulse response (FIR) filters,  which have fixed-duration impulse responses. The simplest  analog IIR filter is an RC filter made up of a single resistor  feeding into a node shared with a single capacitor. This filter  has an exponential impulse response characterized by an RC  time constant. Because the exponential function is asymptotic  to a limit, and thus never settles at a fixed value, the response  i s  considered infinite.

B. Wavelet Transform  Among all the available signal decomposition tools, the  wavelet transform (WT), which simultaneously extracts the  time and frequency characteristics of a signal, is most suitable  for extracting the spike-and-wave features [13]. The multi  resolution property of the WT allows the decomposition of a  signal into a number of scales, each scale representing a  particular compositional part of the signals. A WT reduces the  original signals into a few parameters, while maintaining the  major characteristics for differentiating the type of EEG  records. In addition, the inherent properties of WT, which was  proven as an efficient tool for biomedical signal processing  [14], include good time and frequency location and  across-sub-band similarity. With these properties, WT is  suitable for inconsistent frequency characteristics in different  time frames.

C. Feature Selection  Genetic algorithm (GA) is one of the artificial intelligence  methods, which designed to simulate the nature process of  biological evolution to solve problems. GA, presented by Prof.

John Holland [15], evolved through the processes of natural  selection, recombination and mutation. GA simulates the  nature cell, its main component elements are genes,  chromosomes, group, and fitness function. It evolves through  the best genetic chromosome found in the current generation  of chromosomes; the next generation of chromosomes could  be more adapted to the environment.

To start from a population of randomly generated  individuals represented in binary as strings of 0s and 1s. In  each generation, the fitness of each individual in the  population is evaluated and selected into the best one. In  addition, the current populations can mutate, recombine and  mate with each other to generate the next genetic generation.

Then, the algorithm will check that if it achieves the  termination condition or not. If this generation does not  achieve the termination condition, otherwise, it will re-select  the best individual which is used in the next iteration, as  shown in Fig. 2.

Fig. 2 Genetic Algorithm Flow Diagram  D. Support Vector Machines  The support vector machines (SVM) [16] map input feature  vectors into a high dimensional space to realize a linear  classification system. By feeding the algorithm with a set of  training data, SVM can determine an optimal hyper-plane that  minimizes the risks [17]. Note that it may not be useful to  achieve high training accuracy. Therefore, a common way is  to separate training data by mapping instances into high  dimensional domain to build models. After data are mapped  into a higher dimensional space, the number of variables  becomes very large or even infinite. A typical approach to  handle this difficulty is solving the dual problems shown in  (1).

System Processing  As described, a multi-class SVM classification with GA  feature selection requests many standard binary SVM  invocations for different parameters [18]. These SVM  invocations combined with genetic algorithm selection are  independent, and we can execute them in parallel. Hence, the  system explores the parallelism of these SVM invocations to  speed up the whole task. With the concept of cloud computing  architecture, several types of modules are implemented, each  of which is a standalone service to complete a designed  subtask. A backend server can execute a mixture of different  modules on demand. To simplify the design of this         architecture, currently, communications among modules are  going through different task lists on the database. The central  control unit would activate these modules which will query the  job list from the database. These modules would execute the  job in order from the list and return the results until the job list  is empty. The database will store the results and the system  server would do the statistic of the results when the job is  finished.

The following is the system architecture and the  descriptions of major modules in Fig. 3.

III. SYSTEM IMPLANTATION  A. Data Acquisition  We collected two sets of clinical data from subjects  receiving routine short term EEG examinations and long-term  EEG monitoring in the Department of Neurology, NTUH. The  first EEG data set was acquired from short-term EEG  recordings of routine EEG examinations. The subjects were  divided into two groups. In short term EEG, we included EEG  data from 13 participants (5 women and 8 men), whose ages  ranged from 20 to 89 years. The second EEG data set was  acquired from five of those patients of epileptic. In long term  EEG, we included EEG data from 5 participants (2 women  and 3 men), whose ages ranged from 34 to 81 years. Thus, in  this paper, we used the long term EEG as a validation set and  tested only the recordings from the five epileptic patients  using the model of short term EEG.

These EEG records are transformed from analog signals to  digital signals by instrument manufacture. All the EEG data  were preprocessed by eliminating artifacts, and the sample  rate is about 200Hz, record channels are 16 channels. In  addition, the EEG signals were digitally filtered by IIR, and  extracted 1700 features [1] after 4 levels wavelet transform.

B. System Implementation  1) Home page Home page is a major part of EAS that it is designed to  allow users to train EEG data and predict the results. Users  can adjust the required parameters and methods of SVM and  GA on this page. After prediction, the system will show the  results of the accuracy. In this page, we also provide the  document of guide to introduce how to use the system.

2) EEG Monitoring Page Fig. 4 shows the interface of EEG monitoring page which  accquires EEG data by AJAX from database, and illustrates  figures by javascript. Users can review the classification of  EAS and annotation to determine if the classification is  correct or not. Once the review is finished, the accumulation  of feedback will retrain the new EEG classfication model. The  functions are explained as below:  EAS can display both unipolar and bipolar EEG signals.

Channel names are shown in area (1). Area (2) plots the  selected EEG record, and the pink area displays the annotated  location of (4). Area (3) is the list of patients? records that has been analyzed in EAS. While users confirm the selected event  results had been classified to wrong classes, users can click the  option buttons to give a new annotation in the area (5). The  modified annotations will be included in the next model  training. Finally, users can navigate 10 seconds backward and  forward of EEG charts by clicking the buttons in area (6). In  summary, the EAS is an automatic EEG reading system that  helps doctors to make clinical decision in real time.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  The EAS is written in C# language running on .NET  platform. The functions provided from the LIBSVM 2.6 C#  edition are modified as the classification web services. In  addition, other various optional functions are also offered,  such as genetic algorithm. In order to fulfill the flexibility, the  system is implemented with modular characteristic which  allows easy incorporation of new methods. There are two  types of EEG data tested in the following statement.

1) Short Term EEG Data The annotated short term EEG records we obtained  includes 1939 2-second epochs of normal activity, 436  2-second epochs of spike activity, and 444 2-second epochs of  seizure activity. Spikes and seizure do not occur frequently  out of the norm. However, these two waveforms are of upmost  detection priority and therefore more samples are needed for a  strong prediction model. Half of the 2-second epochs are  taken for training, and the other half are taken for prediction.

In total, our system currently can output 1700 features for each  2-second epoch. We use these 1700 features together to obtain  the results from the EAS (Table I).

2) Long Term EEG Data In order to validate that our EEG classification framework         can be generalized to data from different acquisition machines,  we trained the classifiers using the entire short term EEG and  tested the trained classifiers using long term EEG as a  hold-out data set. The accuracies of short term EEG data were  83.02% (inter-ictal detection rate) and 100% (seizure  detection rate). The testing results of using the hold-out long  term EEG data are also given in Table I. The inter-ictal  detection rate is 91.18% and the seizure detection rate is  99.22% which are close to the results of short term EEG data.

It means that the features are useful and stable in classifying  epileptic and nonepileptic patients. In addition, Table I also  presents the comparisons with other literatures that both the  accuracies of inter-ictal and seizure are higher than the others.

TABLE I RECOGNITION RATE OF EEG DATA  Normal Inter-ictal Seizure  Short Term EEG Data 93.7% 83.0% 100%  Long Term EEG Data 92.8% 91.1% 99.2%  [19] N/A 76 % N/A  [20] N/A N/A 92.2%    3) System Performance The EAS was built up on HiCloud 15 severs, which  specifications are as follows: CPU: 1.0 GHz, RAM: 8GB,  HDD: 100GB. Although GA-based feature selection is  effective, however, it required 18.55 hours on one server. The  time was reduced dramatically to 3.96 hours when fifteen  generic servers were used as backend servers in the proposed  framework. Fig. 5 shows the required time when different  numbers of backend servers were used. As the number of  backend servers increased, the overhead on the database and  mutual communication between modules also increased.

When more than 5 backend servers were used, the speedup  was slow down. It means that the time consuming of overhead  overtake the saving time of paralleling computing piece by  piece. In addition, we also tested that the entire 10-second  EEG perditions of data preprocessing, feature extraction to  classifier needs 0.68 second to meet requirements in real time.

V. CONCLUSION  Our approach proposed a cloud computing system (EAS)  for neurologists to read EEG records and help them to make  clinical decisions. The EAS was tested using real data from  NTUH and obtained good preliminary results. It reveals that  the overall classification accuracy of the EAS is higher than  90%. In addition, the speedup of the entire training time is  about 4.66 times, and prediction time also meets the real time  requirements.
