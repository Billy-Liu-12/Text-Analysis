Abstract? Cold Atom Laboratory (CAL) is a multi-user facility that will provide the ability to study ultra-cold quantum gases in a microgravity environment.  The laboratory is an internal payload that will operate on the International Space Station (ISS) in 2016.  Principal Investigators from various universities will trade off in designing experiment sequences that vary different parameters, such as magnetic field strength or timing.  The primary science data consists of two images of the cold atoms captured successively at the end of each experiment.

CAL Mission Systems is responsible for payload operations, as well as processing and archival of the science data by the Ground Data System (GDS).  The Mission System architecture is described and design trade-offs are discussed. Also, the requirements, expected capabilities, and margins are compared and analyzed.  The payload will be operated remotely from the CAL Mission and Science Operations Center at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  One challenge is providing real-time operations, despite limited uplink bandwidth available through the Space Network.  Strategies for minimizing uplink bandwidth to enable real-time operations are discussed.

The CAL is currently in Phase B, with its preliminary design in development.  Current progress is described, including algorithms for processing the cold atom images and initial results.
