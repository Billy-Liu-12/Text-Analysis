Therefore the representatives of them, or named scale problems, can?t be ignored, especially over heterogeneous underlying surface. What matters is how to get an ?areal true value? by observations to verify the remote sensing retrieval results.

We carried out a multi-scale observation campaign over heterogeneous surfaces by using an observation matrix composed of eddy covariance system (EC) and large aperture scintillometer (LAS) to estimate the areal information at pixel scale in an oasis. This multi-scale observation experiment was anticipated to reveal the spatial heterogeneity of evapotranspiration (ET) and its impact factors. Meanwhile, it also can provide multi-scale data sets of meteorological elements and land surface parameters that can facilitate the development of scale methods for estimating regional ET over heterogeneous surfaces.

MATERIALS AND METHODS The 5.5 km?5.5 km experimental area was located in the middle reaches of the Heihe River (China), which covered across parts of the Yingke and Daman irrigation districts, with land use types of seed corn, orchards, vegetables and residential area.

An internal 4.4 km?4.8 km area was picked out to deploy the observation matrix.

Within the observation matrix, 17 EC stations (including one for village) were installed according to the crop structure, windbreak, resident area, soil moisture and irrigation status (Figure 1). Three sets of LAS (LAS1, LAS2 and LAS3) were deployed at an equal height of 34 m in the center of the matrix with a north-south direction. It was envisaged that the size of the source areas of these three LASs spaned 3?3 MODIS pixels. In addition, another set of LAS (LAS4) was installed with a north-south direction that covered 1?2 MODIS pixels. The purpose of building an observation matrix composed by LAS and EC sensors was to measure multi-scale ET.

After the experiment, post dada processing and quality control were very important.

We adopted the procedure of data-processing widely accepted by the international to insure the quality of data. Figure 2 shows the data processing procedure for EC data.

All EC data were calculated in this way to assure standard and reliability of the fluxes.

Fig.2 Flow chart of eddy covariance data processing and quality control  EC data from instrument combinations of sonic anemoneter CSAT3 and gas analyzer  ???    LI-7500(A) were chosen here to avoid the influence of different instrument. 2-day (Augest 4~5,2012) variation of 30-min fluxes measured by EC at the 11 stations over corn underlying surface is showed in Figure 3. It is obvious that significant discrepancy existed among these measurements. Thus it reflected the heterogeneity that remote sensing can?t capture but is essential to get a true areal value. Analysis of the differences among the stations was for the data of 51 times selected as below.

Wind friction velocity of 0.1m/s was chosen to asure well-developed turbulence, and only north wind times were chosen to reduce influence of wind distort by tower because sonic anemoneters were all installed to the north.

From ? , the differences were less than 10.0W/m2 for sensible heat flux and less than 5?mmol/m2/s for CO2 flux while 29.4~44.1W/m2 for latent heat flux which indicated the big differences of evaporation among the stations. All these data will support high quality datasets for the verification and validation of the airborne and satellite remote sensing results.
