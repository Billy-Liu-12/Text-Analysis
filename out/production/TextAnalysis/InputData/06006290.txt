A Framework for Weighted Association Rule Mining  from Boolean and Fuzzy Data

Abstract?Association rules mining is one of the most important tasks in the field of data mining. It aims at searching for interesting relationship among items in a large data set. In this paper, we present a novel approach for mining the fuzzy weighted association rule from boolean and fuzzy data in large data set, where a weighted value is assigned to each item, we develop a novel approach to calculate the support and confidence of the weighted items, experimental results show that the proposed method is efficient and scalable.

I.  INTRODUCTION Association rule mining(ARM) searches for interesting  relationship among items in a large data set. Market basket analysis, a typical example of ARM, analyzes buying habit of customers by finding association between the different items that customers put in their shopping cart (basket). Apriori algorithm is an influential algorithm for mining frequent item- set for generating association rules, and most of existing algorithms are based on it. Typically, most algorithms first generates all large (frequent) item-sets from which association rule sets are derived, finding the large item-sets is a time consuming, so prune techniques are needed to limit the search space for finding large item-sets.

Unlike the classical ARM, fuzzy ARM was proposed using fuzzy sets such that quantitative and categorical attributes can be handled[1]. A fuzzy quantitative rule represents each item as (item, value) pair. Fuzzy association rules are expressed in the following form[2]:  If  X is A satisfies Y is B, For example, if (age is young)? (salary is low)  Given a database T , attributes I  with item-sets IX ? , IY ? and },,,{ 21 nxxxX = and },,,{ 21 nyyyY = and  =YX ? ? ,we can define fuzzy sets },,2,1{ fxnfxfxA = and },,2,1{ fxnfxfxB =  Associated to X and Y  respectively.

In classical ARM, it is assumed that all of the items have the same importance, the weight of each item in the data set is the same(weight=1), but there are not always the case. Take the shopping in the supermarket for example, we may not consider the rings and dentifrices as the same important goods, because  the rings are usually more profit per unit sale that that of dentifrice. According to the importance of each item, a weight is assigned to each item, so, weighted ARM had been proposed.



II. RELATED WORKS In weighted fuzzy ARM, there are two approaches for  analyzing data sets with weighted settings[2]: pre-and post- processing. pre- and post-processing. Post processing handles firstly the non-weighted problem (weights=1) and Then perform the pruning process later. Pre-processing prunes the non-frequent item-sets after each of iteration using weights. In pre-processed classical ARM, item-sets are pruned by checking frequent ones against weighted support after every scan. This results in less rules being produced as compared to post processing because many potential frequent super sets are missed.

In [3] a post-processing model is proposed. Two algorithms were proposed to mine item-sets with normalized and un- normalized weights. The k-support bound metric was used to ensure validity of the ??downward closure property(DCP)??, but still there is no guarantee that every subset of a frequent set will be frequent unless the k-support bound value of (k-1) subsets was higher than (k). An efficient mining methodology for Weighted Association Rules (WAR) is proposed in [4]. A Numerical attribute was assigned for each item where the weight of the item was defined as part of a particular weight domain. Similar techniques for weighted fuzzy quantitative ARM are presented in [5,6,7]. In [8], a two-fold pre processing approach is used where quantitative attributes are discrete into different fuzzy linguistic intervals and weights assigned to each linguistic label. A mining algorithm is applied then on the resulting dataset by applying two support measures for normalized and un-normalized cases. In[2], a novel approach is presented for mining weighted association rules from binary and fuzzy data, it solve the problem of DCP in weighted ARM with the novel approach to calculate the support and confidence of the weighted items, but we think it had two drawbacks , one is that it could be very sensitive as the support threshold vary for the generation of the frequent item-sets, another drawback is that the approach is unreasonable for some item-sets, for example, there are two item-sets: ?ab? and ?cdef?, suppose the weight of each item is the same(weight=0.5), the support threshold is 0.3%, the total     number of transactions in data set is 1000000, so, according to the approach present in [2], item-set ?ab? is frequent if its support count is equal to or more than  12000, but to the item- set ?cdef ?, it is not  frequent unless its support count equal to or exceed 48000, that seems to be unreasonable for this case.



III. PROBLEM DEFINITION  the problem definition consists of terms and basic concepts to define item?s weight, item-set transaction weight, weighted support and weighted confidence for both boolean  and  fuzzy data. In the following, we discuss the problem for fuzzy ARM mining for the two types of data respectively, and it can be used in the real data set which consists of these data.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach,  we had performed several experiments compared with other similar approach, experiments were done on data set which was described in [2], weights were generated randomly and assigned to all items in the data set to show their importance, they were undertaken using two different association rule mining techniques, namely classical fuzzy ARM and FWARM present in [2]. The results are as follows:    From the experimental results showed, we can see that the proposed approach had been generated more frequent item-sets and rules than that of the classical ARM and FWARM done, the reason is that compared with the other two methods, the proposed method can yield a relatively little variation of the    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  Figure 1.Frequent Itemsets generated using user specified support  f r e q u e n t  i t e m s e t s  FWARM  Clsssical ARM  Proposed method    20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90  Figure 2.Number of rules generated using user specified confidence  N u m b e r  o f  R u l e s  FWARM  Clsssical ARM  Proposed method    weight Item-set Transaction between item-sets. The proposed method and FWARM have higher execution time because they deal with the fuzzy data with the way as discussed previously.



V. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we have presented a novel framework for the  weighted fuzzy association rule mining from Boolean and fuzzy data. we defined a novel way to calculate the item?s weight, item-set transaction weight, fuzzy weighted support and fuzzy weighted confidence, experimental results show that the proposed method is efficient and scalable.
