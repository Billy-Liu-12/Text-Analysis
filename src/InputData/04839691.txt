Using Decision Trees to Detect and Isolate Simulated  Leaks in the J-2X Rocket Engine

Abstract?The goal of this work was to use data-driven methods to automatically detect and isolate faults in the J- 2X rocket engine. It was decided to use decision trees, since they tend to be easier to interpret than other data-driven methods. The decision tree algorithm automatically ?learns? a decision tree by performing a search through the space of possible decision trees to find one that fits the training data (with the hope that this tree will also generalize to new data). The particular decision tree algorithm used is known as C4.5. Simulated J-2X data from a high-fidelity simulator developed at Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne and known as the Detailed Real-Time Model (DRTM) was used to ?train? and test the decision tree. Fifty-six DRTM simulations were performed for this purpose, with different leak sizes, different leak locations, and different times of leak onset.
