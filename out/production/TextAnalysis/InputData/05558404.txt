A Framework for Development of Cost-effective Irrigation Control System Based

Abstract- Pakistan's economy is mostly based on agriculture.

The country faces big problem of water shortage and mismanagement. To cope up with this situation some IT based irrigation control system should be implemented that can deal with proper monitoring, distribution of water etc. We propose a Wireless Sensor and Actuator Network (WSAN) for Irrigation control which is low cost, ensures proper monitoring of the field, less human involvement, instant and accurate decision making. Different kinds of sensors are used and scattered throughout field to collect required data that is then processed and analyzed. It is a fact that a close relationship lies between agriculture and irrigation. The increase in the water? needs of the country has directly proportion to the shortage of the water resources. The efficient management & maintenance of water resources and controlling the water wastage will improve the water resources that are the most beneficial factors in the agriculture. The proposed Sensor-based model monitors many environmental parameters like temperature, humidity, soil moisture, etc.

I. INTRODUCTION  Irrigation is the artificial process of water to land for agricultural production. Pakistan already lacks water resources hence there is need of effective management of water to land for the production of agriculture [1]. According to the report of World Bank, Pakistan is one of those countries which face the shortage of water and its management because of many reasons [2].

The purpose of design and developing a prototype of irrigation control using WSAN is to ensure that water is distributed properly and evenly. As we are getting exact values of the environmental parameters deciding as to which area is having a shortage of water, then as per requirement of the crop the water is supplied and in this way the water is not wasted. By this, the water is only supplied to those areas which actually need water. This paper also provides 24 hours monitoring of the field resulting in better crop growth that would not be possible in case of human monitoring ..

II. BACKGROUND STUDY AND LITERATURE REVIEW  This survey discusses the technology and other computerized solutions over irrigation control. The survey will be beneficial in development of a new and comprehensive irrigation control system with many advantages for resource management. Existing irrigation control technologies having many deficiencies have been compared and referenced. Many models have been compared with our proposed model that is cost effective and contains many other characteristics. A Wireless Sensor and Actuator Network (WSAN) is a group of sensors and actuators linked by wireless medium to perform distributed sensing and actuating tasks. Wireless sensor network technology (WSN) is an efficient method which provides dynamic, real time observation for distributed data collection and monitoring [3].

Hui Liu et al. [4] discusses WSN framework for monitoring of environment in greenhouses. He proposed how to design, deploy and test a framework for wireless sensor network using WSN for monitoring environment in agriculture. Its main advantage is proposing an inexpensive solution for wirelessly monitoring the agricultural fields and to increase the yield of crop. S. Meshwaran describes the importance of WSN in his research paper [5] and discusses tremendous applications in data acquisition of the wireless sensor networks. He has also presented a comparison of the available motes in the market.

There are many challenges in the domain of agriculture like climate change, water shortage, labor shortage, societal concerns etc. Cattle farming that also very much dependent on agriculture domain, has some other issues like animal welfare, food safety and environmental effects etc. Tim Wark [6] created a pervasive and self-configurable sensor based solution for analysis of the animals' behavior and the pastures evaluation. Their work includes the development of solar-powered special sensors, sensor networks for pasture's soil moister assessment and photographic analysis of grass growth, and the sensor network for animal behavior (sleeping, grazing, ruminating etc.) analysis and control.

Hairong Xiao et al. [7] introduced a set of wireless communication protocol for data management. With the help of self-designed sensor nodes wireless sensor network was      developed that is useful for different domains such as military affairs scout, safe precaution systems, data wireless communication systems and environmental monitoring.

Morais et al. [8] discusses the employment of a wireless sensor network for agriculture with soil moisture sensor that is integrated into it. In order to improve irrigation efficiency, several SPW AS have been deployed for the measurement of soil moisture. Various techniques have been used for soil moisture sensing. Vlado Handziski [9] discusses in general system of sensor node frameworks that have been deployed at places and are at present used by various organizations for experimental research. Robert Szewczyk [10] discusses technological progress and system architecture in integrated, CMOS communication devices and sensors that makes a rich design space of networked sensors workable. Jason Lester Hill [11] proposes an architecture that addresses firm needs of wireless sensor networks. Hardware, software and operating system is validated by the proposed architecture.

The architecture is capable to maintain dynamic and context specific transmission regulations without disturbing effectiveness and efficiency. Chih-Yung Chang [12] proposes that the importance of broadcasting is essential to set up a path from source node to a region of sensor nodes. It also discusses and gives deployments details of WSN.

Stockholm [13] and Haque [14] discuss the way of designing efficient and reliable communication protocols for wireless sensor networks for indoor monitoring applications. They claim that it is a difficult task because of the environment's dynamicity and uncertainty.



III. SYSTEM DESIGN  There can be vast variety of sensors that are commercially available. In regard of sensing of environmental parameters the sensors which are mostly used are: temperature sensor, humidity sensor, ambient light sensor, soil moisture sensor, etc. Sensors gather information about the physical world and actuators perform appropriate action based on decisions.

A. THE SENSOR MOTE  ? At the sensor mote, the sensor data aggregation would be done by the help of the sensors attached; those are light sensor, temperature sensor, humidity sensor and soil moisture sensor.

? The processing of the aggregated data would be done at the processing block.

? The packet formation would be done of the processed data. The packet would be containing the destination ID of the sink node.

? The packet would be send wirelessly (through ZigBee) to the sink node.

? The sensor motes in our case are two but they can be 'n' number of motes.

B. THE SINK NODE  ? The incoming packet would be de-capsulated.

? The data from the de-capsulated packet would be aggregated and managed respectively.

? The managed data would be stored in the database.

? At the base station the respective processing would  be done and decision making would happen at the decision making block.

? The decision would be again packetized with the destination ill of the respective actuator.

? The packet would be send wirelessly (through ZigBee) to the actuator node.

C. THE ACTUATOR NODE  ? The incoming packet would be de-capsulated.

? The respective actuator will do the ill checking for  its own ill.

? Once the actuator finds that incoming packet is for it,  the asked task of actuation would be performed. In our case the task is to ON/OFF the sprinkler.

? The actuator nodes in our case are two but they can be 'n' number.

D. THE NETWORKING  Wireless link  Semi Automated WSAN  Figure 1. Network Design  ? All the sensor motes and actuator nodes are independent.

? All the nodes form a mesh network.

? In our case we are working on the Semi-automated  architecture of WSAN, where sensors detecting the environmental parameters transmit their sensed data to the sink nodes which process all incoming data and issue action commands to actuators; this is the Semi-Automated Architecture because the sink is the central controller that collects data and issues the actuating commands.

? All the nodes (the sensor motes) send the sensed data in the form of a packet to the sink node which is wired to the base station where the entire decision making takes place.

? Once the decision is taken and the packet is formed, the packet is sent to the actuator node.

V2-379 Volume 2     ? The actuator node de-capsulate the incoming packet and performs the required task (in our case ON/OFF the sprinkler).



IV. DESCRIPTION OF WSAN SOFTWARE FOR IRRIGATION CONTROL  For data acquisition from sensor motes, request packet is sent via ZigBee module. In response the requested sensor mote sends the data packet having four types of sensors data values. Same process is used for getting data from different sensor motes. The requests are sent after every defined interval (in our prototype this interval is 5 minutes). When the data is received, it is de-packetized and sensor values are separated and then placed in respective database table of the sensor after checking the sensor mote ID from the received packet. The error correction (filling the missing values) is performed by placing the previous value.

For decision support system, different threshold levels are defined for finding temperature, soil moisture, air moisture and light stress levels. Decisions for actuation of sprinklers for irrigation are made when some area of the field is found in stress condition that could be temperature, soil moister, air moister, light or the combination of them. The decision of actuation describes the switching of particular sprinkler for defined time that is also sent within the decision packet.

The software for irrigation also provides the facility to see the trends graphically. The graphs can be generated to see temperature, soil moister, air moister and light variations.

The current values of the sensed quantities can also be viewed sensor mote wise/area wise. The software is in initial phase that's why it is providing only limited features. There are many features that can be added like graphical representation of land condition. Its decision support system also providing limited decision power.

The selection of technology and hardware components has been carefully done. The selection is based on a low? power wireless standard with maximum permissible range and not-so-high data-rate because the overall system aggregate is already being supported by the sensor network's mesh topology. Out of the available technologies i.e. Wi-Fi, Wibree, ZigBee, Bluetooth etc., we have chosen ZigBee as it is fulfilling our requirements i.e. low-power, reasonable range, average data rate, low cost etc. Temperature Sensor, Humidity Sensor, Soil Moisture Sensor and Light Sensor are the major sensing devices used in the proposed model.



V. CONCLUSION  In this paper a prototype for Irrigation Control using WSAN has been proposed. This model continuously monitors concentrated area through sensors which are sensing the environmental parameters like; temperature, ambient light, humidity, soil moisture etc. On the basis of the values sensed, it would be judged as to which area is facing  shortage of water. After having all calculations needed, particular area that needs water is pointed out and the water is provided in a calculated manner for fixed time. Using this approach the water is not wasted and distributed to those areas only which need it. The sensor nodes are scattered throughout the field. Light sensor, Temperature sensor, Humidity sensor and Soil moisture sensor are major components to achieve the task. The aggregated data is processed and its packet is formed that contains Destination ID of the sink node (which is the target location of the packet). The packet is sent wirelessly to the sink node. In this way water shortage that happens because of mismanagement can be controlled. The major characteristics of the model include: Transformation of data in less time, Proper decision making, Communicated primitives that provide addressing for sensor networks, Authentication of nodes, Next hope forwarding, and Redundancy & fault tolerance. The proposed model is easy to deploy, cost-effective and facilitates properly maintained irrigation system. Followings are the major benefits of the proposed model.
