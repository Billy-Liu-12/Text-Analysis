There are three fundamental problems that need to be address to accurately estimate RUL.  First, health index data is noisy.  Even with filtering, the HI can be difficult to trend. Second ? a damage model is required address component degradation.  Finally, a relationship between physical damage and measured health/condition needs to be established.

This paper explores methodologies to de-noise vibration data, model damage propagation using Paris Law, and address inferred damage via condition indicators by using maintenance vs. safety of flight criteria to initiate repair activities. 1 2  The RUL prognostic is validated on established crack data, and testing on HUMS derived fault data.
