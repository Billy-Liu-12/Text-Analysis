INTRODUCTION Bearing faults have a direct impact on the operation rotating machinery, and their influences can be reflected through rising temperature, periodic acoustic emissions, larger torque amplitude, higher vibration level, increasing stator current, and wear debris accumulation. The vibration, stator current [1], and wear debris related approaches [2] have dominated recent research work. Among them, the vibration-based techniques have attracted more attention because vibration signals mainly reflect the local properties and are not sensitive to operation environment changes.

The dominant failure mode of ball bearings is spalling of the races resulted from the fatigue crack that begins below the metal surface and eventually generates a small pit or spall.

Whenever a local defect on the bearing interacts with its mating element, abrupt changes in the contact stresses generate vibration that can sometimes be used to monitor   2 IEEEAC paper#1401, Version 6, Updated 2008:10:30  the health status of the bearings. Although these spalling- related frequencies can be estimated, they are usually buried in noise until damage is significantly large and begins to cause faults [3].

When monitoring bearing damage in rotating machinery, the characteristic frequencies of bearing damage are often used to monitor certain frequency components emanating from vibration [4]. Signals from vibration sensors are usually measured and compared with reference measurements in order to interpret bearing conditions. The methods used to analyze these signals include shock pulse methods (SPM) [5], wavelet [6], intrinsic mode functions (IMF) [7], independent component analysis (ICA) [8], high order statistics [9], and amplitude modulation [10]. Although these approaches deal with the bearing fault diagnosis in different directions, the core problems that they face are quite similar. The local fault makes the bearings produce vibrations that correspond to a linear modulation signal, which usually superimposes on other vibration sources in the rotating machinery. Compared with signals from other vibration sources, these signals are characterized by having a high frequency range, relative large amplitude, and short duration.

The behavior of friction torque in the precision aerospace instruments of interest is quite unique and different from the classical Columb friction and the Stribeck-type behavior. In particular, when the instrument traverses through ?zero,? it experiences a discontinuity in the friction during the velocity reversal. This discontinuity makes the classical friction models unsuitable for control applications, in particular when precision positioning is of chief concern [11] and [12]. The Stribeck friction behavior [13] which is frequently used to characterize different regimes of lubrication - i.e., boundary, mixed, and hydrodynamic regimes - is also not suited for ultra-low speed motion with velocity reversal.

Further complications arise since spacecraft bearings are typically coated with a thin film of solid lubricant. When subjected to oscillatory motion, the coating tends to gradually wear out [14]. This is particularly crucial in applications where the repetitive, oscillatory-type motion occurs over a small area. As a result, the wear particles -          often referred to as the third bodies - are produced in the contact area. Depending on the type of coating used, these particles can cause problems in the tracking instruments, which require precise motion control [15]. Furthermore, upon full removal of coating, metal-to-metal contact becomes imminent and failure is likely to occur shortly thereafter. Kotzalas and Harris [16] investigated spall size of the ball bearings and accelerometer signal as a function of time. Interestingly, despite the importance of the subject matter, there is a crucial lack of information in the literature about coating life and friction force in ball bearings as coating wear progressively increases.

The bearing vibration frequency features and time-domain characteristics have been applied to classifiers such as neural networks [17] or HMM [18] to build an automatic bearing fault diagnosis machine. However, temporal transient features for detection of bearing fault have not been studied. A new bispectrum and entropy analysis method [19] has been developed to extract and classify the temporal transient features from bearing friction measurements and bearing faults via Gaussian Mixture Hidden Markov Model (GM-HMM).  Here we further expand our previous work [19] and focus on non-invasive measurement such as vibration signals for coated bearing monitoring, thus the method is intended for use in existing instrumented thrust ball bearings whose races are coated with MoS2. The ball bearings are set in oscillatory motion under a specified amplitude and frequency and their behavior is monitored in near real-time. These bearings have distinctly different tribology and failure mode(s) than those that are oil lubricated.

In this paper we show that the degree of randomness (DoR) can be used to infer the propagation of bearing faults.

Specifically we apply Shannon entropy and random matrix theory (RMT) to extract the temporal transient features from bearing vibration signals. Based on the definition of randomness [20], it is shown that Shannon entropy can be used to measure the uncertainty of random signals. RMT is concerned with the distribution of eigenvalues of high- dimensional randomly generated matrices. Examples include correlation matrices and covariance matrices generated from random physical measurement. RMT was initially developed by Wigner [21] and Dyson [22], and has been recently applied to different applications including network traffic analysis [23], stock market analysis [24].

To classify the fault stages, we have further developed a set of stochastic models using Gaussian Mixture Hidden Markov Model (GM-HMM) theory with the feature space made of DoR measures. Instead of using the discrete sequences, our GM-HMMs can incorporate the feature vectors modeled as Gaussian mixtures. To facilitate online bearing fault identification, we have built GM-HMMs for individual fault stages. At each evaluation time, all GM- HMMs are evaluated and the final detection is refined based on Bayesian inference.

This paper is organized as follows: An experimental laboratory system and related data are described in Section 2. The tribological analysis is given in Section 3. Then in Section 4, a new feature space using DoR measures is described. HMM-GMMs used for the detection of ball bearing fault stages is given in Section 5. Laboratory experimental results are presented in Section 6, followed by feature space analysis and conclusions.

2. EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEM The ball bearing tests were performed using the LRI-1a heavy-duty tribometer, manufactured by Lewis Research, augmented with a vibration monitoring system designed at LSU Center for Rotating Machinery.  Figure 2-1 shows the combined schematic of the test rig, data acquisition, and vibration monitoring system. The tribometer records tribological data such as the coefficient of friction and wear (as vertical displacement). The coefficient of friction and wear are measured using a load cell and an LVDT sensor, respectively. The machine is capable of running oscillatory tests and multistep tests. Normal loads up to 1100N (250 lbs) can be tested with this apparatus. The vibration monitoring system consists of two PCB ICP-accelerometers with a data translation DT300 PCI board series used for data acquisition. The sensitivity of the accelerometers is approximately 1000 mV/g. A graphical interface has been programmed using the National Instruments LabVIEW data-acquisition software to collect, continuously monitor, and store the vibration data for analysis. Vibration signal was sampled at 2.5 KHz sampling frequency, then signal re- sampled to a lower frequency for the signal analysis purpose.

3.  TRIBOLOGICAL ANALYSIS Test bearings were series 2902 standard grooved thrust bearings with 12 ball cages. Untreated balls and races were made of 52100 Hardened Steel. Molybdenum Disulphide (MoS2 ) coating was deposited on the bearing races with two different thicknesses of 4800? and 7800?.

The crystallographic structure of MoS2 is shown in Figure 3- 1 [25]. In its natural form, it appears as a hexagonal structure consisting of S-Mo-S layers where each molybdenum atom is surrounded by six sulfur atoms. Due to electron sharing, the bonds between the M and S atoms are very strong, but the bonding between the S atoms is very week, since they are governed by the van der Waals forces.

From tribological view point, this is fortuitous since the weakness of S-S bonds enables the layers of MoS2 to easily slide over one another in the so-called basal plane. As a result, the shear strength in the basal direction is low. When used as a solid lubricant coating, MoS2 provides a very low interfacial coefficient of friction as the basal planes tend to aligned themselves in a parallel fashion to the substrate surface [25].

Extensive sets of laboratory tests have been conducted to empirically determine the performance of coated ball bearings under varying load and oscillation frequency. Of particular interest is the determination of bearing vibration signal as a means of monitoring ball bearing health. For this purpose, friction, wear, and vibration signals are recorded during the entire test, from healthy period where the bearing runs smoothly to failure when metal-to-metal contact occurs. The results presented in this paper pertain to Oscillatory tests with 30? sweep angles with 0.5-1.0 Hz frequencies.

Figure 2-1: Schematic of the experimental setup  and data acquisition system  The coating wear process is complicated, partly due to high anisotropic behavior exhibited by MoS2. Research shows that the wear process in a solid coated bearing can be characterized by considering the competitive formation and ejection of the coating debris. Powder debris begins to form as a result of balls plowing through the coating, followed by film transfer from the coating to the balls, and initiation of coating wear. The role of each of the aforementioned processes - i.e., plowing, film transfer, and adhesion wear - is controlled by the load, speed, and oscillation frequency.

Also as a result of loading and oscillatory motion balls tend to push the debris particles away from the contact area. But the debris is not ejected out of the loading zone as it formed, as the high self-adhesion of the coating material restrains fast ejection. However as the oscillation cycles continue coating begins to chemically degrade and lose the self- adhesion, thus removal from the loading zone begins. Other studies have also reported the chemical degradation of MoS2 under continues grinding in oxygen (Roberts 1987).

This process continues until the coating completely wears out and the balls come into intimate contact with the steel substrate. At this stage because of the lack of adhesion of coating debris to steel substrate a fast ejection regime begins and continues until the debris are removed from the contact area.

4.  FEATURE SPACE CONSTRUCTION USING DEGREE OF RANDOMNESS  4.1 Degree of Randomness of Random Signals  We hypothesize that the vibration signal associated with faulty bearings is primarily superimposed of two independent vibration signals ? one from the surrounding environment such as bearing platform and the other from the faulty bearings. This idea is illustrated in Figure 4-1.

Figure 4-1: Linear combination of signals associated with surrounding environment and faulty components.

Let X and Y be two statistically independent random variables. For example, in a bearing system, X can be the vibration signal associated with the platform such as bearing housing, and Y be the vibration signal from faulty bearings.

The sum of random variables (discrete or continuous) have been studied over the past several decades. Suppose the random variables X and Y have density functions fX(x) and fY(y), respectively. It is known that the sum Z = X + Y is also a random variable with density function fZ(z), where fZ is the convolution of fX and fY defined as   dyyfyzfzffzf YXYXZ )()())(()( ? ?  ??  ?=?=        (4.1)            Although the probability density function of a random variable can be used to derive many useful statistical properties, it is not effective in estimating the degree of randomness. In fact, the variance derived from a density function cannot be used to infer the degree of randomness.

For example, suppose X is a uniformly distributed variable over an interval of [-1 1]. It can be shown that var(X) = 1/3.

One can easily generate a random variable with variance larger than 1/3. However, it is known that the uniformly distributed variables have the largest degree of randomness, which implies that the variance is not an effective measure of randomness.

We are more interested in the randomness of a random variable. Denote DoR of X and Y as RX and RY. We want to estimate the DoR of the new random variable, Z = X + Y. In other words, if we define DoR of z as RZ, we want to know whether or not the following inequality holds  RZ ? max(RX, RY)                                               (4.2)  If (4.2) is satisfied, we conclude that the random variable X + Y is more random than X or Y.

The majorization technique has been used to define the randomness of a random variable [20]. Majorization is a partial ordering on vectors which determines the degree of similarity between the vector elements. Let ? denote the class of all discrete probability vectors. For P = (p1, p2, ?) and Q = (q1, q2, ?) in ?, assume that all elements of P and Q are arranged in non-increasing order. We say that P is majorized by Q (written as P ?  Q) if   ?? ==  ? r  i i  r  i i qp  (4.3)   for all r > 0. We now state the following definition of randomness [20]:  Definition of Randomness  For P, Q ? ? we say that there is at least as much randomness in P as in Q if P ?  Q. If P ?  Q and the elements of P cannot be obtained by permuting those of Q we say that P has greater randomness than Q.

From this definition, it follows that a degenerate distribution (i.e., one for which all the probability is concentrated at a single outcome) is less random than every non-degenerate distribution. The uniform distribution (1/n, ?, 1/n) is more random than every other distribution having at most n positive probabilities. The best-known measure satisfying the definition above is the Shannon information entropy given as   ? =  ?= K  i ii ppH   ln                                  (4.4)  where H is a real-valued function and K is the number of possible categories. Therefore, Shannon entropy can be used to estimate the randomness of a random variable. The DoR of X + Y can be summarized by the following theorem:  Theorem [20]  Let X and Y be independent discrete random variables.

The distribution of X + Y is more random than that of X or Y unless one of these distributions, say that of Y, is degenerate in which case X + Y and X are equally random.

This theorem implies that, in general, the random variable X + Y is more random than either X or Y. Therefore, by monitoring the randomness of vibration signals, we can detect the existence of a new independent random variable associated with faulty components.

Since our DoR-based approach is application independent (i.e., data-driven), DoR should be used to build the feature space. This measure is also closely related to Random Matrix Theory (RMT). In RMT framework, a random matrix is formed and the statistical distributions of its eigenvalues are analyzed. It was found [24] that the largest eigenvalue of the correlation matrix of stock process represents the influence of the entire market that is common to all stocks. The eigenvalues of random matrix can be used as a measure of randomness. Since the data window size can be large, it is not feasible to calculate the eigenvalues of a large random covariance matrix. To overcome this problem, we estimate DoR using infinity-norm which also is equivalent to the magnitude of the largest eigenvalue.

4.2 Feature Space Construction Using DoR  The effectiveness of a Hidden Markov Model is largely dependent on the construction of relevant feature space. In general, features are selected based on specific applications.

For machinery health monitoring applications, features must be adapted when different equipment are being monitored.

As we have shown above, both Shannon entropy and random covariance matrix inf-norm can capture the dynamics associated with faulty components. We therefore use these two measures of randomness to construct the feature space for bearing fault classification.

Our feature vector is made of two measures of randomness:   ? ?  ? ? ?  ? =    f f  f                                   (4.5)   where f1 is the Shannon entropy defined as   ? =  ?= K  i ii ppf  1 ln                                  (4.6)            and f2 is the random covariance matrix norm defined as  f2 = || R||?                                                   (4.7)  where R is the random covariance matrix of the data. An example of this feature space is given in Section 6.

For the estimation of Shannon entropy, we have developed an algorithm to adaptively estimate the probability density function using histograms. The probability density function based on Principle of Maximum Entropy [26] has been compared with histogram-based estimation scheme. We have found that Shannon entropy estimated from histogram- based probability density function has fewer discontinuities.

This is largely because there is hardly any pre-knowledge about bearing vibration data other than their statistical mean value which could be zero.

5.  GM-HMM FOR BALL BEARING FAULT CLASSIFICATION  To classify the fault modes, we have further developed a set of stochastic models using Gaussian Mixture Hidden Markov Model (GM-HMM) techniques. An HMM is characterized by the following:   (1) The number of states in the model, N. We denote the set of states as S = {S1, S2, ?, SN}. Although the states are hidden, for many practical applications there is often some physical significance attached to the states or to sets of states of the model. The state at time t is denoted as qt.

(2) The number of distinct observation symbols, M.

We denote the set of observations as V = {v1, v2, ?, vM}. The observation symbols correspond to the physical output of the system being modeled.

The choice of symbols is arbitrary. For example, one can choose the set of observations as {1, 2, ?, M}.

(3) The N?N state transition matrix, A, whose (i, j)  entry is the probability of a transition from state i to state j defined as follows   aij = P(qt+1 = Sj | qt  = Si) aij  ? 0  ? =  = N  j ija    for 1 ? i, j ? N.

(4) The N?M observation matrix, B, whose (i, k) entry  is the probability of emitting observation symbol vk given that the model is in state i defined as follows    bij = P(vk at t | qt = Sj)                   (5-2)  for 1 ? j ? N, 1 ? k ? M.

(5) The initial state distribution ? = {?i} where   ?i = P(q1 = Si)                   (5-3)   for 1 ? i ? N.

Given appropriate values of N, M, A, B, and ?, the HMM, often represented as ? = (A, B, ?),  can be used as a generator to give an observation sequence  O = O1O2?OT                                                  (5-4)  where each observation Ot is one of the symbols from V, and T is the number of observations in the sequence.

In most HMM applications, the observation Ot is assumed to take the discrete values in a set O = {o1, o2, ?, oM}.

However, for our application, there are no specific discrete observations. In other words, we are dealing with a continuous feature space with certain underlying statistical distribution. Therefore, we must develop a HMM with output observations drawn values from a feature space. Here we model the distribution of feature vectors as a Gaussian Mixture Model.

Given data y with independent multivariate observations y1, ?, yn, the likelihood for a mixture model with G sub- clusters is   ?? = =  ?= n  i  G  k kkikkGGL  1 1 11 ),|()|,...,;,...,( ??????? yy   (5-5)   where ?k is the probability that an observation belongs to the  kth cluster (?k ? 0; ? = = G  k k1 1? ), ?k is given as     ( )  )2det(  )(  ),|(   k  kik T  ki  kkik ? ? ? ?  ? ? ? ???  ??  ?  ?  ?? ??  yy y  -exp (5-6)   The data generated by mixtures of multivariate normal densities are characterized by clusters centered at the means ?k with increased density for points near the mean. The variance matrix ?k can be expressed in terms of its eigenvalue decomposition  Tkkkkk DAD? ?=                                  (5-7)   where ?k = |?k|1/d, Dk is the matrix of eigenvectors of ?k, and Ak is a diagonal matrix with the normalized eigenvalues of ?k on the diagonal in a decreasing order. The parameter ?k  (5-1)          determines the volume of the kth cluster, Dk its orientation and Ak its shape.

As an example, Figure 5-1 illustrates the fault stage classification procedure for a system with three fault stages.

Transient features are applied to all GM-HMMs.

Figure 5-1: Block diagram for a GM-HMM based classifier.

The fault stage classification can be made based on Bayes? Theorem. Denote Ac as the event that observation y comes from cluster c. We are interested in estimating the posterior probability P(Ac | y). By Bayes?s Theorem,     ? = ? ?== G  k kkkk  ccccc c  f  f P  APAP  ),|(  ),|( )(  ),()|( ??  ??  y  y y  yy   (5-8)   where c = 1, 2, ?, G. The observation y belongs to cluster c if P(Ac | y) = Max{P(Ak | y), k = 1, 2, ?, G}.

6. TEST RESULTS USING LAB DATA 6.1 Data Description  To test the performance of our bearing health monitoring algorithms, we have conducted a series of laboratory experiments and obtained a set of bearing vibration signals.

The bearing coating thickness is 4800? and a load of 150 lbs was applied. The test duration was 2000 minutes.

Acceleration data were recorded on two channels at 5.0 Hz sampling frequency. Two channels provide the chance to limit part of the noise and also provide with information about the optimum placement of the sensors. Table 6-1 summarizes the operating conditions for this experiment.

Table 6-1 ? Operating conditions for one experiment      Figure 6-1 shows the vibration data at one channel. The major change of the acceleration data occurs after the healthy condition of bearing illustrating high vibration peaks. While bearing working at healthy condition, i.e. the first 600 minutes, the acceleration response is bounded within ? 2V. As the coating wears out, the balls begin to touch the bare metal surface As a result, the vibration signal register ?impact-type? shocks that appear as spikes. It should be noted that to extract detailed information for  feature analysis, the gain on the system was chosen as 100x based on the healthy working condition, i.e. when coating was available. Hence, when the balls contact the races and spikes occur, the signal exceeds the DAQ board?s margin and this result in a saturated signal.

Figure 6-1: Vibration signal over a period of 2000 minutes.

Figure 6-2 shows the friction data collected in the same experiment. From the friction data, we can see the evolution of bearing faults. There are four stages marked as Normal, Fault A, Fault B and Fault C, which are not easily observable in the vibration data shown in Figure 6-1. The challenging task is to detect these four stages from the vibration data alone. The friction data is used as the reference signal for the algorithm development only.

Figure 6-2: Friction signal collected in the same experiment and four bearing stages.

Microscopic examination of the races at the conclusion of the experiment revealed metal on metal contact. Shown in Figure 6-3, this evidence is limited to parts of the ball finger print on the race. The ball footprint as can be seen in Figure 6-3 is toward the outer edge of groove. Contrary to the un- grooved bearings, no packing effect can be seen in the turning points of the ball footprint. This is due to the fact that ball cages have 12 balls in grooved bearing contrary to 8 balls in un-grooved ones which with 30 degree oscillations cover the turning points of neighbor ball and prevent the packing.

Figure 6-4 shows a close-up of the highlighted area in Figure 6-3. Delaminated plates of oxide layer are formed because of sub-surface cracks propagation. Formation and wear of oxide layer can be regarded as the major friction controlling mechanism.

Figure 6-3: Ball fingerprint on the race of wear track.

Figure 6-4: Ball fingerprint on the race of oxidative wear.

6.2 Feature Space  The vibration data shown in Figure 6-1 is used to construct the feature space. Both Shannon entropy and infinity-norm of random covariance matrix are estimated. Figure 6-5 shows the DoR measures together with the vibration data and related friction data. In this figure, the third plot shows the temporal trend of Shannon entropy and the bottom plot is the temporal trend of random covariance matrix inf-norm.

It can be observed that both Shannon entropy and random covariance matrix inf-norm have accurately captured the bearing fault evolution. Although the four stages are not clear in the vibration data, they are clearly observable in the DoR trends. Moreover, the trend shapes of Shannon entropy and random covariance matrix inf-norm are very similar, which indicates that the random covariance matrix inf-norm can be used as an effective measure of randomness of random variables.

Since randomness of Fault C is relatively similar to the randomness of Fault A and Fault B, we only construct three feature vectors associated with Normal, Fault A and Fault B.

In fact, based on tribological analysis, the stage of Fault C is directly related to bearing failure. In other words, when the bearing is in the stage of Fault C, the system can no longer operate appropriately.

Figure 6-5: Temporal trend of Shannon entropy (3rd) and inf-norm of random covariance matrix (bottom) estimated from the vibration data (top).

The four stages of bearing faults can be clearly seen in the DoR trends.

Figure 6-6 shows three clusters in the feature space which are associated with three bearing stages. It can be observed that these three clusters are well separated, which indicates that the features made of Shannon entropy and random covariance matrix infinity-norm can be used to identify the fault stages of the ball bearing. However, the Fault C cluster is missing, which makes it impossible to classify this stage based on clusters. In our monitoring algorithms, we use GM-HMM to infer this fault stage.

Figure 6-6: Feature space with three well-separated feature clusters associated with fault modes.

6.3 Fault Classification Using GM-HMM  We have applied 10% of the data shown in Figure 6-1 for the training of a GM-HMM. Three separate GM-HMMs were trained, each representing one stage: Normal, Fault A or Fault B. They were then fused to generate the final states from the complete model. We then applied all of the data (including training data) to the trained GM-HMM. The state transitions are shown in Figure 6-7. In this figure, the four fault states are obtained from the analysis of randomness of the signal (see Figure 6-5).

Figure 6-7: Classification of GM-HMM using the feature space shown in Figure 6-6.

From Figure 6-7, we make the following observations:   (1) GM-HMM made the correct transition from ?Normal? to ?Fault A?. There is a small transient transition period in which states ?Normal? and ?Fault A? alternate frequently. This phenomenon makes physical sense since mechanical system changes states gradually.

(2) After the transient transition from ?Normal? to  ?Fault A?, the bearings are in ?Fault A? state. As the bearings are wearing out gradually, they start a long transition period with states varying among ?Normal?, ?Fault A? and ?Fault B?.

(3) Bearing stay at ?Fault B? for a long period of time.

(4) As bearings continue wearing out, they enter in a  new state which is not modeled by GM-HMM during the training phase. One can see that the states vary between ?Fault A? and ?Fault B?.

Based on the tribological analysis, data in this region are associated with bearing failure or ?not- useable? stage. Although our GM-HMM does not provide a new state for this region of data, it can clearly be inferred through the frequent transitions between two fault states, ?Fault A? and ?Fault B?.

In many industrial applications, the data related to machinery failure are difficult, if not impossible, to get. It is practically important to infer the failure state using non- failure data. The results shown in Figure 6-7 clearly indicate that GM-HMM can be used to predict bearing failures without actually using the failure data.

CONCLUSIONS We present a feasibility analysis for the development of an online ball bearing fault detection and identification method which can effectively identify various fault stages related to the dynamics of vibration related to the contact in the coated ball bearings. To detect the ball bearing faulty stages, we have developed a new degree of randomness (DoR) analysis methodology using Shannon entropy and random matrix theory. Test results have shown that DoR can be used to detect the small abnormal transient signals associated with the bearing friction and wear evolution. To identify the fault stages, we have further developed a set of stochastic models using hidden Markov model (HMM) theory. Instead of using the discrete sequences, our HMM can incorporate the feature vectors modeled as Gaussian mixtures. To facilitate online fault identification, we build a HMM for each fault stage. At each evaluation time, all models are evaluated and the final health determination is refined based on individual detections. Test results using laboratory experiment data have shown that our system can identify coated ball bearing faults in near real-time.
