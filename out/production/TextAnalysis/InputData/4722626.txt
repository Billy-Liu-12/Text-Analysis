Frequent Patterns of Investment Behaviors in  Shanghai Stock Market

Abstract? To analyze the behavior of investors in Shanghai stock market, we mine frequent itemsets and association rules from a real securities clearing dataset. The mining results indicate that, most investors do not diversify their capital to avert risks according to expected risks of a stock. Further analysis reveals that most of the frequent stocks itemsets only cover a few state-owned big-cap (SB) stocks, and the right side of the association rules, both global and constrained, are mostly SB stocks. All these phenomena make clear a behavioral mode, investors in Shanghai market pursuit SB stocks universally. On the other hand, another group of investors who do not follow the behavior above incline to purchase extremely similar stocks to build their portfolios, whether in the same industry, like banking, energy, materials, and transportation,  or in the same category, like ?special treatment? stocks.

I.  INTRODUCTION  In data mining, association rule learning is a popular and well researched method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases. Piatetsky- Shapiro describes analyzing and presenting strong rules discovered in databases using different measures of interestingness. Based on the concept of strong rules, Agrawal et al. [1] introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large scale transaction data recorded by point-of-sale systems in supermarkets. Han et al. (2001)[2] proposed a novel frequent-pattern tree (FP-tree) structure, and developed an efficient FP-tree-based mining method, FP-growth, which is efficient and scalable for mining both long and short frequent patterns, and is about an order of magnitude faster than the Apriori algorithm.

Some researchers apply this algorithm to mine the stock trading data to learn frequent patterns of purchasing stocks. Wang & He (2005) [3] discusses two patterns in data mining: association rules and sequential patterns, and describes the process to find these patterns by mining historical securities trading database. Through the analysis of mining result, their study presents the concept and realization of customer behavior model, and successfully applies the model to advance the performance of Internet securities dealing system.

These researches do not extract the investment behaviors behind these patterns and ignore their deep significance. In this paper, we focus on discovering the investment behavior in Shanghai stock market, and apply the algorithm for association rules to a real securities clearing dataset. The results are in form of a list of frequent itemsets and association rules, from these results, we know more about the investment behavior in Chinese Stock Market.

This paper is organized into five sections. We introduce the securities clearing data applied in our study, and the method of association rules learning in Section 2.

In Section 3, we describe the clearing data and explore it.

Our study results and corresponding analysis are presented in Section 4. Finally, we give out our analysis of the patterns, and conclude the paper in Section 5.



II. METHODOLOGY  According to the comparability between portfolio and shopping basket, we use association rules to look for frequent patterns in the data.

A. Frequent Itemsets and Association Rules  The following three conceptions are used in this algorithm to analyze investors? portfolio.

Itemset: An itemset is a set of items. Each item is an attribute value. In the portfolio example, an itemset contains a set of stocks such, as Microsoft, IBM, and Intel.

Each itemset has a size, which is the number of items contained in the itemset. The size of itemset { Microsoft, IBM, Intel } is 3. Frequent itemsets are those itemsets that are relatively popular in the dataset. The popularity threshold for an itemset is defined using support.

Support: Support is used to measure the popularity of an itemset. Support of an itemset {A, B} is made up of the total number of portfolios that contain both Stock A and Stock B.

Support ({A, B}) = NumberofTransactions(A, B)         (1)  Confidence: Confidence is a property of an association rule. The confidence of a rule A=>B is   DOI 10.1109/CSSE.2008.1311     calculated using the support of itemset {A,B} divided by the support of {A}. It is defined as follows:  Confidence (A =>B) = Support (A, B)/ Support (A)      (2)  B. Algorithm parameters  The process of finding these patterns is accomplished with the help of SQL Server 2005 Analysis Services (SSAS). We use it as our primary data mining tool, due to its complete DM algorithms and decent graphical user interface.

Association rules algorithm is very sensitive to the algorithm parameter settings. The following is the list of parameters for the Microsoft Association Rules algorithms. We will give a short introduction [4], and the parameter settings in our study are shown in Table I.

TABLE I.  PARAMETER VALUES IN OUR STUDY  Parameter Value  Minimum Support 0.03  Minimum Confidence 0.4  Maximum Itemset Size 3  Minimum Itemset Size 2  Maximum Itemset Count 200000    Minimum_Support is a threshold parameter. It defines the minimum support requirement items must meet to qualify as a frequent itemset. Its value is within the range of 0 to 1.

Minimum_Confidence defines the minimum probability for an association rule. Its value is within the range of 0 to 1.

Maximum_Itemset_Size specifies the maximum size of an itemset. The default value is 0, which means that there is no size limit on the itemset. Reducing the maximum itemset size reduces the processing time as the  algorithm can save further iterations over the dataset when the candidate itemset size reaches this limit.

Minimum_Itemset_Size specifies the minimum size of the itemset. The default value is 0. Reducing Minimum Itemset Size will not reduce the processing time because the algorithm has to start with itemset size 1 and increase the size step by step.

Maximum_Itemset_Count defines the maximum number of itemsets. If not specified, the algorithm generates all itemsets based on Minimum_Support. This parameter avoids generating a large number of itemsets.

When there are too many itemsets, the algorithm will keep only the top n itemsets based on lift score of itemset.



III. DATA  In this study, we use a real clearing data from a Chinese brokerage firm, and all investment accounts in this data are open in Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE).

Securities clearing data contains rich information[5] , covering all the security  types ? stocks, funds, bonds, options, and tremendous accounts information, including daily security alteration, security holdings, capital alteration, opening or closing accounts, as well as every transaction?s stock name, quantity, market value and commission. Our study focuses on the Account Share Holdings(ASH) table, which records all account holders? every security purchasing and corresponding holdings.

The dataset contains 110,763 accounts, however, we pay most our attention to those who buy stocks, instead of fund or bonds. There are 106,941 accounts and 247,337 records in the database; every investor holds 2.31 individual stocks on average.

We explorer the securities clearing data, and calculate the frequency of purchase of every stock, from both the population of shareholders and the total amount of holding shares of every stock. In Table II and Table III, the top 10 most purchased stocks are listed. For example, stock 601398 is held by 7137 investors out of 55798, occupying 12.8 percent. Over 10% investors buy the first 3 stocks, 601398, 600050, 601988, and each investor, at average, holds 11089, 9668, 8608 shares of them respectively.

IV. RESULTS  After the results of data mining are acquired, we display the frequent intemsets in Table IV and the association rules in Table V.

In Table IV, the first 10 frequent itemsets are listed, ordered by their frequency, which can be read from the column ?No. of Cases?. Every frequent itemset represents a portfolio, and the size of it equals the size of an itemset, it is 2 in Table IV The rates of return of a portfolio, shown in the column ?rate of return?, are the relative yield, which equals the real yield minus the fluctuation of SSE Composite Index, where the real yield is the weighted average of the portfolio with the number of shares of either stock as its weight, and the time spans of 30 days and 180 days are, representatively, from 07/02/2007 to 07/31/2007 and from 07/02/2007 to 12/28/2007.

TABLE IV.  FREQUENT ITEMSETS AND CORRESPONDING RATES OF RETURN  No. of Cases  Size Frequent Itemsets  Rate of Return  30 days 180 days  1427 2  601988, 601398 -4.89% 39.24%  1024 2  601398, 600050 -4.33% 41.99%  825 2  601988, 600050 -6.87% 65.91%  538 2  600016, 601398 -0.08% 12.78%  521 2  600028, 601398 -4.08% 27.62%  510 2  600028, 600050 -6.54% 60.62%  507 2  601998, 601328 -7.80% 48.64%  502 2  600016, 600050 -1.20% 36.48%  491 2  601328, 601398 -3.23% 20.12%  424 2  600028, 601988 -7.87% 58.06%  The observation of these portfolios reveals that, among the first 10 frequent portfolios, there is only one of them, (600016, 601398), which successfully averts non- systemic risk. It closely follows the fluctuations of the SSE Composite Index. The other nine portfolios, on the contrary, intensify the fluctuation instead of diminishing it.

This phenomenon contradicts the hypothesis of Markowitz?s mean-variance criterion that investors averts risks, at least in China.

5 5  3 3          Banking Material Energy Transport Others Figure 1.  Top 20 stocks concentrate in four industries  Furthermore, the first 10 frequent portfolios only cover seven individual stocks, all of which are SB stocks. Each of these stocks is commonly regarded as a blue chip stock, a stock of a well-established company having stable earnings and no extensive liabilities. Accurately, these corporations are oligopoly enterprises in their industries, and super big-cap stocks with a market capitalization value of more than 10 billion.

Meanwhile five of them belong to banking industry, and top 20 stocks based on the top purchases are merely in four industries: banking, material, energy, transportation. Because in China these industries are state- owned monopoly industries ? and are protected by governments with competence, therefore their profits are ensured.

The same phenomenon is found in the association rules, as shown in Table V To express simply and clearly, we explain the meaning of the formula, ?Stock A -> Stock B? means that those who purchase Stock A are likely to purchase Stock B with the possibility of confidence, and we say Stock B is the frequent partner (FP) stock of Stock A. For instance, in Table V, stock 601328 is the FP stock of the union of 601919 and 601988.

These ten rules contain eight stocks, seven of which are SB stocks, while 601318, the only exception, is of a non-state-owned financial company. That is to say, the FP stock of  an union of two SB stocks is still a SB stock.

In addition, there is a whole class of stocks on China's stock market called "special treatment stocks". Special Treatment (ST) stocks are shares in companies that have failed to earn profits for two years or have been fingered for false accounting. Apparently,  this kind of stocks are highly possible to fluctuate incredibly and bring investors, especially retail investors, huge risks. We discovered some association rules which concerned with ST stocks, and exhibit the first 10 in Table VI. At the right side of the rules are the most possible purchased stocks for those who purchase ST stocks, however, most of them are super SB stocks. Among all the 29 ST stocks, shown in Table     VI, the frequent partner of twelve of them is 600050, and that of 25 of them are SB stocks.

However, there are some exceptions in the association rules, nearly all of which are composed of the extremely similar stocks. The portfolio is composed of Stock 601318 and 601628, Ping An of China and China Life Insurance Group, which are the two biggest insurance  company in China. Among the 29 ST stocks, as mentioned above, there are four stocks whose FP stocks are not SB stocks, they are ?600847 -> 600715?, ?600076 -> 600868?, ?600695 -> 600108?, ?600090 -> 600197?, the first two pairs both are composed of ST stocks, and the two stocks in the third pairs are both in agriculture industry, and that of the last one are in Wine Industry and located in Xinjiang. In a word, some investors buy extremely similar stocks.



V. CONCLUSION  In this paper, we seek the patterns about how a portfolio is built, and use these patterns to learn more about investors? investment behavior to deepen our understanding to behavioral finance and financial market.

The association rules algorithm is applied to a real securities clearing dataset, and a group of association rules and frequent itemsets are obtained. The results disprove the hypothesis of Markowitz?s mean-variance criterion that investors avert risks, and the further analysis discovers two behavior, that most investors in SSE incline to build their portfolios with state-owned super-big-cap stock(s), and a certain proportion of investors buy highly similar stocks that are in the same industries, like banking, energy, materials, and transportation, or in the same category like ST stocks.
