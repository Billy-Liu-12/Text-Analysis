Application of Association Rules Mining in Power  Demand-Side Management Based on Rough Set

Abstract- Appling association rule mining to power demand-side management can supply references to optimizing decision-making project. The paper introduces the principle of using rough set in evaluation of DSM implementation. First, relevant attributes are simplified by rough set theory. And then, association computation rules based on rough set are constructed to reduce the scale of the decision table. Giving an example, it explains how power market behavior characters affect implementation of DSM projects.



I. INTRODUCTION Power demand-side management (DSM) refers to plan and  implement series of measure by power-supply Company to alter user electric-power consume action, which brings load curve expected. Processing power DSM can improve load time character and quantity, which is significant to resource using integrative [1].

At present, many researches of power DSM include two categories: the one is to perfect DSM policy, statute and technology [2], the other is to analysis power DSM cost-benefit by applying mathematical modeling [3]. All of above focus on DSM cost or operation mechanism, and ignore power user need?s influence to DSM. To mine the potential of demand-side resource, one important task of DSM is working up the long-term mechanism about energy efficiency. It needs to build DSM evaluation system for DSM projects selecting and implementation, which includes various factors in power market environment. Association rules data mining method is useful pattern mining knowledge to dispose DSM issues efficiently.

Combined with attribute reduction based on rough set, it advances efficiency of mining decision rule. With plentiful information data in power system, it analyzes main power market behavior characters that influence DSM implementation.

Using association rules mining based on rough set, it gets the relationship between them, which simplify actual complex issues.



II. ROUGH SET THEORY [4] Rough set theory is a math tool depicting incertitude  information formed by Pawlak, a Poland scholar, in 1982. It analysis and disposals various imperfection information effectively, which is useful to find connotative knowledge and potential rule. Indiscernibility relation is an important base concept in rough set, on the basis of which, it defines upper and lower approximation, etc. It?s noticeable that rough set theory  doesn?t ask for any affixation information about data in the process of mining knowledge. It follows some basis defines of rough set reduction arithmetic.

A.   Basis Conception Definition 1: A lower approximation of X refers to the  maximum definable set included in R of X.

[ ]{ } { }XYRUYXXUxXR R ???=??= :/:  Definition 2: An upper approximation of X refers to the minimum definable set included in R of X.

[ ]{ } { }?? ????=???= XYRUYXXUxXR R :/: Definition 3: It calls set BNR = R X RX as R boundary region  of X; POSR(X) = RX is called as R positive region of X; NEGR(X) = U XR is called as R negative region of X. If boundary region is none, X is called as R definable Sets.

Definition 4: R refers to an equivalence relation family, and Rr ? , if ( ) { }( )rRINDRIND ?= , r is called as dispensab1e in R,  or else r is indispensable. If Rr ??  and R is dispensable, calling family R independent.

Definition 5: If Q is independent and IND(Q) = IND(P), Q ? P is called as a reduction of P. The core of P is marked as ( )PCORE , which is a set of all dispensab1e relation. If Red(P) is a reduction of P, ( ) ( )PREDPCORE ?= .

B.    Reduction and Core Computation  Reduction of decision-making table includes attribute reduction and value reduction. Attribute reduction can delete condition attribute which have no effect on decision result. After reduction, there are less condition attribute in decision-making table, but keeping former function. The step of reduction is following.

Step 1: Delete repeat row; Step 2: Let C1, C2, , Cn is an attribute subset of attribute set  C, and D is decision subset, counting A = U /IND(Ci); Step 3: Let set [ ]niAR i ,,2,1 ?== , counting ( )RINDU ; Step 4: Counting POSR (E) with educing classification from  set R; Step 5: Counting U /IND(R Ai), and estimating if result is  equal with POSR Ai (E). If they are equal, attribute Ai is dispensab1e, which is deleted. If they aren?t equal, attribute Ai is indispensab1e, all of which are called as core.



III. ASSOCIATION RULE MINING BASED ON ROUGH SET [4] Association rules reflect the interdependence and relevance  between one thing and other things. Association rules mining     refers to mining valuable data which describing the links between the relevant knowledge in amount of data. There are two important conceptions -- support and confidence.

A.    Definition of Association Rule Let I={i1, i2, ,in} be a set of item. Let D, the task-relevant  data, be a set of database transactions where each transaction T is a set of items such that IT ? . Each transaction is associated with an identifier, called TID. Let A be a set of itemsets. An association rule is an implication of the form BA? , where  IA ? , IB ?  and ?=? BA . Appling association rule in decision-making table DT, there are condition attribute c C, decision attribute d D. Rule dc?  refers to attribute c associating with decision, that is, c conducing d.

The rule holds in the transaction set D with support s, where s is the percentage of transactions in D that contain A B. In decision-making table, support s usually is defined as:  ( ) ( )( )iDCDCount dcCountdcSup ?=?  The rule dc?  has confidence c, if c is the percentage of decision-making table containing c that also contains d,  ( ) ( )( )cCount dcCountdcConf ?=?  Rules that satisfy both a minimum support threshold (min_sup) and a minimum confidence threshold (min_conf) are called strong. For an example, ( ) ?? dcSup  min_sup and  ( ) ?? dcCount  min_conf, rule dc?  is strong rule set.

B.    Arithmetic of Association Rule [5], [6]  Let DT is decision-making table inputting, Rk is rule sets gained by minimum support threshold (min_sup) and a minimum confidence threshold (min_conf). Referring to Apriori, arithmetic construct is following.

Step 1: Attribute reduction of decision-making table.

Step 2: k = 1.

Step 3: Counting support s and confidence c of each rule in  candidate set Ck.

Step 4: If support s is less than min_sup(i) and confidence c is  less than min_conf(i) in some rule, deleting it from Ck. Whereas, moving it into rule set Rk.

Step 5: Let Ck expanding to Ck+1. Scanning Ck, combining any two items of Ck into candidate set with (k+1) attributes, inserting Ck+1. After combining, counting support s and confidence c applies in following formula:  ( ) ( ) ( ){ }feSupdcSupfedcSup ??=?? ,min, ( ) ( ) ( ){ }feSupdcConffedcConf ??=?? ,min,  Deleting rules using min_sup(i+1) and min_conf(i+1).

Step 6: k = k + 1, if Ck+1 is none, go to Step 7, or else Step 3.

Step 7: Ending.



IV. APPLICATION IN POWER DEMAND-SIDE MANAGEMENT One important research of power demand-side management is  various reasonable mechanisms, which are useful to DSM implementation effectively. Therefore, it?s necessary to form a more integrate evaluating model on DSM project. Former evaluating model is based on economic benefit, in which static  data can?t depict DSM contribution to power system accurately.

Evaluating DSM synthetically includes power supply branch, system operation, customers, even resource saving and circumstance protect.

A.    Constructing an Evaluation System on DSM Project The reason why user purchase electric-power is it can bring  lots of advantage. The key of DSM actualization successful is usually urging user joining or accepting DSM plan actively. In detail, DSM projects alter customer load shape to realize power consume reasonably. The key question focus on customer acceptance degree to DSM, that is, an important research is how to change customer electro behavior and durative of altering.

It reports that electro load shape can be evaluated by forecasting electro equipment purchase and behavior. Moreover, there are multi-factors effecting equipment purchase and electro behavior. They include the relationship between power price and substitute fuels price, demography index (such as earnings, age, education degree, etc.). Beside, there is equipment characteristic on DSM, inspiriting strategies and legal standards acting on DSM implementation. The paper discusses mainly how five factors above effect DSM project and degree, which is the basis of structure DSM evaluating system.

Regarded five factors above as system condition attribute C ={C1, C2, C3, C4, C5}, and results of DSM implementation as decision attribute D = {D1 D2 D3 } = { permanence, mid-long-term, short-term }. Combining with investigation data on DSM research project in Hebei, there is an information table using attribute choose and processing, which is a relation database mode (Table I).

TABLE I INFORMATION OF POWER MARKET BEHAVIOR CHARACTER  Attribute Attribute Value  C1: price ratio between power price and substitute fuels  C10: more than 1  C11 equal  C12 less than 1  C2 earning, education level  C20:highe r C21: middle  C22 lower  C3: equipment characteristic  C30: better C31: middle  C32 inferior  C4 :inspiriting degree C40: better C41: middle  C42 inferior  C5: legal standards C50: perfect C51: middle  C52: lesser  Gathering 300 data record automatically, if same record appears 20 times more, the evaluation is regarded as representative, which turns into a rule in decision-making table.

There is an example: decision-making table D1(Table II).

B.    Attribute Reduction Decision-making table attribute reduction using rough set,  distilling contributive attribute to DSM evaluation.

Z1 = U / IND (C1) = {{2, 4, 8, 13, 14}, {1, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15}, {7,  9, 11, 12}}; Z2 = U / IND (C2) = {{5, 6, 9, 11, 13}, {3, 4, 8, 12, 14}, {1, 2,  7, 10, 15}}; Z3 = U / IND (C3) = {{1, 5, 10, 15}, {2, 3, 9 12 13 14}     {4 6 7 8 11}}; Z4 = U / IND (C4) = {{2, 6, 9, 10, 11, 14}, {1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 12, 15},  {5, 13}}; Z5 = U / IND (C5) = {{1, 2, 9, 14}, {3, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13}, {4, 6, 10,  11, 15}}; Z6 = U / IND (D1) = {{1, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13}, {2, 5, 6, 7, 11,  14, 15}}.

Let R = {Z1 , Z2, Z3, Z4, Z5 }, U / IND (R ) = {{1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, {5}, {6}, {7}, {8}, {9},  {10}, {11}, {12}, {13}, {14}, {15}}, POSR Z6 = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15 }, U / IND (R -Z1) = {{1}, {2}, {3, 12}, {4}, {5}, {6}, {7}, {8},  {9}, {10}, {11}, {13}, {14}, {15}}, POS R -Z1 (Z6) =  {{1}, {2}, {4}, {5}, {6}, {7}, {8}, {9}, {10},  {11}, {13}, {14}, {15}} POSR (Z6).

Therefore, Z1 is indispensable.

U / IND (R ?Z2) = {{1}, {2, 4}, {3}, {5}, {6}, {7}, {8}, {9},  {10}, {11}, {12}, {13}, {14}, {15}}, POS R -Z2 (Z6) =  {{1}, {3}, {5}, {6}, {7}, {8}, {9}, {10},  {11}, {13}, {14}, {15}} POSR (Z6).

U / IND (R ?Z3) = {{1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, {5}, {6}, {7}, {8}, {9},  {10}, {11}, {12}, {13}, {14}, {15}} POS R ?Z3 (Z6) =  {{1}, {3}, {5}, {6}, {7}, {8}, {9}, {10},  {11}, {13}, {14}, {15}}=POSR (Z6).

Thus, Z3 is dispensable. Counting respectively POS R ?Z4 (Z6)  and POS R ?Z5 (Z6), it shows that Z4, Z5 are indispensable, and Core = { Z1, Z2, Z4, Z5}, deleting Z3.

Association Rule Mining Defining (Ci, v), v refers to value of attribute Ci and dv is value  of decision attribute. Rule turns into (Ci,, v) =>(D1, dv). Appling definition and formulas in part III, it gets 24 items of one-order association rule (Table III). If a rule support is less than  min_sup(1), it needn?t confidence counting. Let min_sup(1) =0.18 and min_conf(1) =0.55, there are 7 items of rule, which create second association rule. If (C1, 1) => (D1, 1) and (C2, 0) => (D1, 1), they create rule (C1, 1), (C2, 0) => (D1, 1) using arithmetic in part III. With min_sup(1) and min_conf(1), some rules are deleted.

In rule set, it shows easily how various factors effect DSM result and degree. Similarly, it gets rule (C1, 1), (C2, 0), (C4, 0) => (D1, 1). Repeating the process, until there isn?t a new rule creating. Following is a strong rule set of DSM project evaluation, which is explained how various factors effect DSM implementation.

Rule (C1, 1), (C2, 0), (C4, 0) => (D1, 1): Power load changes keep in long-time: electrovalence is near to substitute fuel price; the level of customers earning and education is higher; the effects of DSM inspirit policy is better.

Rule (C1, 0), (C4, 0), (C5, 1) => (D2, 1): A power load change is fluctuant slightly in a period of time: electrovalence is higher than substitute fuel price; the effects of DSM inspirit policy is better; DSM legal standards is defective.

Rule (C1, 0), (C2, 1), (C5, 2) => (D3, 1): Power load change comes back formerly in short-time: electrovalence is higher than substitute fuel price; the level of customers earning and education is middle; there is less legal standards in DSM system.



V. CONCLUSION Data Preprocessing is a key step in data mining. Appling  rough set on data preprocessing, it improves the efficiency of association rule mining.

Applying association rules based on rough set to mine the relationship between power market characters and DSM implementation effect, it can find out knowledge between power market demand and DSM market exploiting strategy.

Combining with market segmentation of other factors, manager designs various DSM marketing projects externally to solve power DSM implementations.
