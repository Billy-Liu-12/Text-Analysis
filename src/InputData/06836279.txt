The V2Suit "Down" Tracking Algorithm

Abstract- The Variable Vector Countermeasure Suit (V2Suit) is a wearable intravehicular system that will provide a viscous  resistance to movements that are parallel to a specified  direction of 'down.' The V2Suit utilizes control moment  gyroscopes (CMGs) in modules on the user's limbs that are  commanded to point the gyroscopic torque vector  perpendicular to 'down' during movements. An algorithm  has been developed to initialize the direction of 'down' and  track the V2Suit module with respect to that direction using  the output of an on-board inertial measurement unit (IMU).

The 'down' tracking algorithm uses the angular velocity and  linear acceleration outputs of the IMU to initialize and  determine the direction of 'down' in the local module  coordinate frame. This paper describes the algorithm for  initializing the direction of 'down' for each of the V2Suit  wearable modules, and the tracking of the module orientation  and velocity with respect to that direction. IMU data from  representative arm movements was collected and run through  the initialization and 'down' tracking algorithms to quantify  performance as a function of time. The performance of the  IMU and algorithm combination is used to determine the  operational duration before the system must be re-initialized.
