A Group-based Inference Approach to Customized Marketing on the Web -Integrating Clustering and Association Rules Techniques

Abstract Because of the intelligent computing specialty of the World Wide Web, extensive customized marketing can be executed at much lower cost and has become an emerging research issue. Therefore, the first purpose of this paper is to purpose a system fi-amework to serve as a foundation for developing a customized marketing system on the Web according to the discussions on data sources, data categories, and inference foundations.

Most previous studies used induction-learning techniques to perform individual-based inference for customized marketing, However, it not only costs more to learn the personal preferences, but also some difficulties occur from using induction-learning techniques. The second purpose of this paper is to solve these problems, A group-based approach that integrates clustering and association rules is proposed, We conducted a field study to collect data to demonstrate the proposed group-based inference approach and evaluate its performance. The results reveal that this integrated approach can learn both more detailed and precise rules.

L Motivation  For a long time, customized marketing has been the ultimate direction of marketing efforts in order to improve customer satisfaction, Traditionally, it is done mainly by sales and therefore the cost is very high, In fact, due to the intelligent computing specialty of the Web, extensive customized marketing can be executed at much lower cost.

An identical characteristic of several famous successfid sites, such as Peapod and Amazon, is its notable interactive capabilities. Customized marketing has become an emerging research issue. However, most of the current marketing systems on the Web have not filly taken advantage of the Web?s interactive capabilities [17].

In order to implement customized marketing, a compIete picture of the consumers is necessary.

Compared to traditional selling techniques, one distinguished capability of the Web is the ability to  perform continuous unobtrusive observations on customer browsing behavior. In other words, in addition to the basic demographic data, such as age, occupation, gender, and purchasing data (e.g., product name and quantity), the browsing behavior can be collected through CGI programs, cookies, etc. That is, a Web server can collect the information on the decision process rather than only the decision result. Based on these data, we can capture a more comprehensive user profile, which can serve as foundation for customized marketing.

What kind of data can be collected? What form should the system framework of a Web site be in order to collect this data and then transform this massive data into usefi.d knowledge, such as marketing rules and a customized marketing mechanism? The first purpose of this paper is to identi$ the required data and mechanisms for creating user profiles and then propose a system framework to serve as a foundation for developing a customized marketing system. The user profile data sources and data categories, and the way to infer user profiles and marketing rules will also be discussed.

In the system framework for customized marketing, how to transform raw data into user profiles and marketing rules is the most important issue, Generally, there are two types of customized marketing, individual- based and group-based. Most previous studies focused on individual-based inference for customized marketing.

However, the more deliberate the individual-based marketing, the more expensive the implementation. In addition, to new customers, the individual-based rules may not make sense when collecting only a small amount of availabIe data. Additionally, with old customers, the individual-based rules may not adapt to their changing preferences. Based on the above situations, the second purpose of this paper is to propose a group-based inference mechanism.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we propose a system framework for customized marketing to describe the mechanisms of collecting customer data and the related inferences. In Section 3, we discuss some issues from previous approaches to target marketing first and then propose an approach for integrating clustering and association rules as the   0-7695-0493-0/00 $10.00 (c) 2000 IEEE 1    mechanism of inference. In Section 4, data collected from an experiment is used to demonstrate the approach and its performance. Finally, we end this paper with conclusions in Section 5.

2. A system framework of customized marketing  The user proiile and the inference mechanism engine are the core of a customized marketing system. Tsai [25] defined the user profile as ?a set of keywords which describe the information in which the user he is interested in.? Similarly, some approaches base the user profile on the user?s likes and dislikes [15]. For instance, one system, Syskill & Webert, allowed the user to provide feedback on the amount of interest or useftdness a Web page provided [1]. On the other hand, Liberman and Maulsby [18] inferred the user?s preferences from his behavior, In this study we adoptecl a broader definition that defines the user profile as a database which maintains all information about customers [16]. The user profile is the foundation of a customized marketing system, which provides better service to customers. The inference mechanism manages how to infer the user profile as well as marketing rules. First we will discuss the data sources and data categories for a user profile as well as the different inference foundations. A fsystem framework for customized marketing will be proposed in the remainder of this section.

2.1 Data source  Bauer and Scharl [6] provided a categorization system based on three different information sources. First, the Web server could collect network parameters. Second, the customers provide data by iilling out an online questionnaire. Finally, a third party provides verified network information. Kautz, et al. [12] proposed the ReferralWeb system finding the co-occurrence of users in any documents on the Web to establish social networks.

In this study, we focused on the information that a Web site can collect from the Web: inside as well as outside the Web site. For information from inside the Web site, one source is provided by customers on purpose, such as data from a registration form, an online questionnaire, online orders, and message board, etc. Customers can choose not to give such data. This data can be collected through CGI or Cookies. Another way to cclllect information from inside the Web site is to observe consumer behavior without the customer? awareness. For instance, online  browsing behavior can be collected by ASP, Cookies or from the log tiles of the server. Whenever a customer accesses a Web site, the site can keep track of the  customer?s behavior until the customer quits the site.

Information collected from outside the Web site might be collected from a virtual community (e.g. bbs, newsgroups) or personal homepage, etc. Such data can be gathered by search engines. These methods are summarized in Table 1.

Customer?spersonal  2,2 Data categories  Based on the Holtz classification from the viewpoint of marketing [9], we divided customer data into raw data and refined data. The raw data is the original data, such as a customer?s ID, age, browsing and purchasing records. For the consumer market, Kotler [14] pointed out that raw data falls into two categories, customer characteristics and customer responses. While customer characteristics include geographic, demographic, and psychographic characteristics, consumer responses refer to purchasing occasions and purchasing quantity, etc.

The retined data refers to data that are extracted, integrated or inferred from the raw data on purpose to have a better picture of customers. For example, it contains information about usage status, brand loyalty, affinity group, and preference evaluation, etc. The refined data can consists of individual-related as well as group- related data.

2.3 Inference foundations  Regarding the inference foundations, Alexander [4] summarized two main technologies underlying one-to-one marketing on the Web. One is rules-based matching, which creates a user profile based on the user?s preferences and information requests. The other is  collaborative filtering, which finds users who have like behavior or taste to create affinity groups, in the hope of inferring what products a user may purchase based on the observations on his affinity group. Resnick and Varian [21] preferred the more general term ?recommender system? instead of collaborative filtering because recommenders may not explicitly collaborate with users.

0-7695-0493-0/00 $10.00 (c) 2000 IEEE 2    There are several papers about recornmendler systems in the special issue of Communications of the ACM, March, 1997 [5][12][13][22] [24].

We challenge Alexander?s classification ?because rules- based matching can be applied to collaborative filtering  too. It is better to classi~ inference foundations into two types: individual-based inference and group-based inference. While individual-based inference is based on individual data, group-based inference is based on afhity group data. Both can be applied to infer a user profile as well as marketing rules.

2.4 System framework  According to the discussions about the essential data sources, data categories, and inference foundations, we propose a system framework for customized marketing, shown in Figure 1. When a customer links to the Web store, cookies on the client side and ASP, CGI and log tiles on the server side can be used to capture his online behavior. The data includes registration forms, online orders, message boards, and browsing paths, etc.

Furthermore, most of time, the customer may access other sites before and after visiting this site. This means that he may leave lots of information on the other ?Web sites. A search engine can be used to search the customer?s related homepages or ICQ accounts and then retrieve his social networks, preferences, resume, and personal plans, etc.

from the sites accessed by or related to the customer.

Marketer  I  igure 1: A System Framework for Customized?~Marketing on the Web  All of the original demographic, geographic, psychographic, and behavioral data are stored in the raw data part of the user profile. A site database is proposed to keep the information about site contents, products, and advertisements, etc. By analyzing the raw data of a user profile and site database, the inference engine can learn valuable information about the customer, such as usage  status, brand loyalty, affinity group, and preference evaluation. This data will be stored in the refined data part of the user profile. The inference results can also be marketing rules that will be kept in the marketing rule base. Similar to the refined data of the user profile, marketing rules can be individual-based or group-based.

Individual-based rules are applied to each specific customer, while group-based rules are applied to members of a specific group. To fire any group-based rule, the first job is to judge to which group the customer belongs.

When a client sends a request that is processed by ASP or CGI programs on the server side, the customized system will be initiated. The control engine will control the interactions. It will retrieve data from the above databases depending on who the customer is and what request is asked for, and accordingly the Web server may use ASP or CGI to produce a document dynamically. In addition, a maintenance interface is designed to assist marketers to maintain the site contents, programs, and marketing rules, etc.

3. Group-based customized marketing -an integrated approach to inference  It has been mentioned that this paper will focus on group-based inference. Compared with the traditional tools of collecting data, much more data on a customer?s browsing and purchasing behavior can be collected from the Web and the data types are much more unstructured and diversified. Consequently, data mining techniques become essential tools to extract marketing rules efficiently as well as effectively.

3,1 Issues in the previous approaches to target marketing  Induction-1earning techniques, such as ID3, CN2, and neural networks @N) have been used to learn rules from past experience [26]. For instance, Zahavi and Levin [27] applied NN to target marketing in solo mailings.

However, they recognized some unique problems that stem from the special characteristics of target marketing using induction-learning techniques. Several issues are presented as follows:  Stochastic problem: Because two customers, with exactly the same attributes, may have different purchasing results, the induction-learning process may be confused and the process may not easily converge.

D@culty in interpreting the NN results: Some induction-learning techniques, e.g. ID3 and CN2, can learn decision rules. However, it is difllcult to explain or defend the rationale for decisions resulting from NN.

This is a big problem in target marketing since marketers   0-7695-0493-0/00 $10.00 (c) 2000 IEEE 3    are uncomfortable in applying these results.

Large number of potential predictors and infinite  number of states: The number of possible attributes might be very large and therefore there might be a correlation between some attributes. In addition, the attribute space might be infinitely large because mlany attributes are on continuous scales. Both problems may cause poor learning.

Low response rate: The proportion of buyers in target marketing is typically very low. The low response rate limits the capability of the induction-learning techniques to learn the chara~cteristics of buyers.

In this study, we challenged the above issues by replacing induction-learning techniques with association rules. The main reason is that association rules can avoid the stochastic problem since they calculate the proportion of the specific itemsets appearing in all transactions to identi& rules rather than learn from each customer. The proportion is also a good index to tell marketers why the rules are produced. In addition, association rules have no problems about large number of potential predictors and infinite number of states because the analysis unit is itemsets of transactions instead of customer?s attributes and behavior. Furthermore, the problem of low response rate is lessened because not only the transaction but also browsing data can be collected from the Web.

3,2 Association rules  Piatetsky-Shapiro and Frawley [20] defined an ?association problem? as finding recurring patterns in data. Following that, many recent studies on data mining have been concerned with the special case of finding association rules from large-scale databases [2]. They intend to find rules, such as ?A customer purchasing item X is likely to purchase item Y.? The problem is represented as follows [3]: Let I={il, i2,..., im} be a set  of items and E) be a set of transactions, where each transaction T is an itemset such that TGI. We say that a transaction T contains an itemset X, if XGT. An association rule is an expression X=aY, where XCI, YcI, and XnY= +. The meaning of such a rule is that in a  transaction database, a transaction which contains X tends to contain Y.

The rule X*Y has supports in the transaction set D if sOA of transactions in D containing XUY. That is,  sO/O=Prob(XuY). The rule XaY holds in the transaction set D with conjtdence c if CYOof transactions in D that contain X also contain Y. That is, c%=Prob(YIX).

However, there is a problem using confidence. The nde is actually worse when Y appears randomly in the transaction. In other words, the reason that X and Y coexist might be the random appearance of Y rather than the relationship between X and Y, Therefore, Berry and  Linoff [7] suggested another measure called improvement, which is given by the following formula: improvement = Prob(YIX)/Prob(Y), Basically, a support score is used to measure how useful is the rule. Confidence and improvement are measures used to tell us how true is the rule.

Agrawal, et al. [3] proposed some algorithms for finding association rules. The Algorithm Apriori is the most fundamental algorithm. In the algorithm, the first pass counts item occurrences to determine the large 1- itemsets. Here, ?large 1-itemsets? means the set of any 1- itemsets which has minimum support. A subsequent pass, say pass k, consists of two phases. First, the large itemsets Lk-~ found in the (k-1 )th pass are used to  generate? the candidate itemsets Ck by means of apriori-  gen function. Next, the database is scanned and the support score of Ck is counted. Then Lk is the set of the  Ck, which has minimum support, These processes are  iterated until Lk. 1 is null. The details can be found in  Agrawal, et al. [3].

Because the Algorithm Apriori only explores the  association between items, it is important to consider the categories of different products in marketing. Srikant and Agrawal [23] proposed Algorithm Basic, which takes account of categories. That is, in Algorithm Basic, it adds all ancestors of each item to the original transactions and removes any duplicates.

Previous studies always explore the association rules based on all transactions. That is, they didn?t consider the concept of segmentation and therefore the extracted association rules are too general to reflect different customer?s needs. In fact, Kotler [14] pointed out market segmentation is the first major step in target marketing.

This is because customers differ in their wants, purchasing power, geographical locations, and purchasing behavior, etc. We believe that it is better to cluster all customers into different groups before exploring the association rules.

In the following, we will discuss clustering.

3.3 Clustering  Clustering is the task of segmenting a heterogeneous population into several homogeneous subgroups or clusters [7]. The records are grouped together on the basis of self-similarity without predefine classes or examples. The K-means method is the most commordy used in practice [8]. The detailed algorithm can be found in Berry and Linoff [7].

However, the K-means method works only on numerical values which prohibits it from being used to cluster marketing data containing categorical scales [10].

Unlike K-means which replaces old means by calculating new means continually for each cluster, PAM   0-7695-0493-0/00 $10.00 (c) 2000 IEEE 4    (Partitioning Around Medoids) developed by Kaufman and Rousseeuw [11] replaces selected medoid, the most centrally located object within the cluster, with other non- medoid objects when the swap cost is negative, Since the medoids move fi-om one object to another object, each medoid represents an existing record. This means that PAM can treat both categorical and numerical scales.

Therefore, we suggest using PAM for clustering.

To find k clusters using PAM, the first step is to determine a representative object randomly, The selected object is called a medoid. By computing the swap cost between a medoid Oi and a non-selected object Oh, we  can decide whether to replace Oi with Oh. PAM will  iterate until there are no more swaps. The detailed algorithm is presented in Ng and Han [19].

However, before applying PAM, there is the challenging issue of the determination of the number of clusters, k. Kaufman and Rousseeuw [11] introduced a measure, silhouettes, for evaluating the clustering results for k=2, 3, . . . . n-1. Silhouettes are constructed in the following way. For each object i of cluster A, we calculate a(i)=average distance of i to all other objects of A. Now considering any cluster C different from A, let c(i)=average distance of i to all objects of C. We select the smallest, b(i)=min {c(i)}. Hence the cluster B, which has minimum c(i), is the neighbor of object i. Then we can define silhouette s(i) as ~(i)= W-a(i) . When s(i) is  max{a(i),b(i)}  larger (that is, close to 1), it implies that object i has been  assigned to an appropriate cluster. Following that, we  calculate the average silhouette width for the entire data ? Then we can choose the k, which has  ?et ~(k)= ~ s(i)/n? i=l  the largest ;(k).

3.4 An integrated approach to inferring user profile  Following above discussions, we propose an integrated approach to inferring marketing rules, shown in Figure 2.

Two steps are suggested in this approach. The first step is to implement clustering based on a customer?s demographic, geographic, psychographic, and behavioral data stored in the raw data part of the user profile, We suggest using PAM to identi~ the affinity group. The k medoids and the individual customer clusters are recorded in the refined data part of the user profile for the purpose of identifying the affinity groups that customers belong.

The second step is to find association rules for each cluster. These rules retrieve transactions or browsing patterns from the raw database. For considering the taxonomies of products, site contents and advertisements, it retrieves related data from the site database. For each cluster, Algorithm Basic is used to learn the associations of products and browsing contents. This means each set  of association rules is valid for a particular cluster only.

The results about group-based association rules are stored in the marketing rule base.

&E@  Ww Figure 2: An Integrated Approach to Infer User Profile  4. Experiment  In this section, a user profile is acquired using the proposed integrated approach and its performance is evaluated. The data used was collected from an experiment in online book purchasing. In order to collect enough data in a short time and control the experimental environment, we did the experiment at a university bookstore rather than allow the subjects purchase at anytime from anywhere. Seventy-six books, consisting of six categories, UNIX, Computer Programming, Management, Electronic Commerce, Belles-lettres and Light Literature, were presented and sold online. For the purpose of encouraging subjects to join the experiment and buy books, all subjects got greater discounts if they bought books using this system. There were three hundred and twenty two subjects participating in this experiment over five days.

The experiment began with a registration form.

Subjects were requested to till in their personal demographic data, Afterwards they were allowed to browse andlor purchase whatever books they liked. The whole process for each subject was recorded through ASP and cookies.

4.1 Results of clustering  As in the previous discussions, we classified the subjects by clustering before exploring the association rules. In the experiment, we collected customers? demographic and behavioral data for clustering, A registration form was used to collect customer?s gender, blood type, age, job, college, grade, income, marital status, years of accessing the Web, daily hours of browsing on the Web, and the most frequent place they accesseding the   0-7695-0493-0/00 $10.00 (c) 2000 IEEE 5    Web. We also used ASP and cookies to record the time (in seconds) spent browsing books, the number of books clicked, and the number of books purchased.

In doing clustering, the distance must be defined in order to measure similarity. There are dozens, if not hundreds, of published techniques for measuring the similarity between two records [7:1, such as Euclidean distance and Mahalanobis? D2, etc. There is no optimal similarity measure. The ultimate goal is to have a better clustering result. Therefore, we tried different similarity measures. Following that, we adoptod the PAM algorithm [11] to perform clustering. However, before applying PAM, another prerequisite decision was the number of clusters. In order to select the best number of clusters given a similarity measure, we counted the average  silhouette width ~fi) for k=2, 3, . . . . 10 first and chose-k  which had the largest ~(k). Finally, we chose the best k  which had the largest ~(k) from all ks selected from  different similarity measures.

In our experiment, the largest ~(k) resulted from the  following distance definition. Suppose there are two vectors x <xl, x2, . . .. Xn> and y <yl, y2, . . .. yn>. If the  ith attribute is a categorical scale, we defined the distance between ith dimensions of x and y as di=O if xi = yi and  di=l if xi * yi. Otherwise, we transferred the data (xi, yi)  into five to seven scales (x:, y: ) and calculated the  distance as di = Ix: ? y: I/(number of scales/2) when the  ith attribute is not a categorical scale. The largest ;(k) is  0,2854 when k=3 (Table 2) and it is also higher than the  second largest sfij, given a particular similarity measure.

We therefore assigned the number of clusters to be 3, The result of clustering is summarized in Table 3.

Table 2: Corn arisen on avera e silhouette width  tiam  Cluster 1 is the eldest group (27.5 years old on average) having more females (600A). Twenty percent of these individuals were school staff members and therefore had higher income. They had the least experience (63?XOless than one year) accessing the Web and were the lightest users (go?/o of them access the Web less than one hour daily). However, they spent more time (276.7 seconds on average) on browsing books and read more books (6.9 books on average), Furthermore, they purchased the most books (2.2 books on average).

For the subjects in cluster 2, most were college students (570A) with the least income (94y0 less than NT 300,000). Compared with cluster 1, subjects in cluster2 had more experience (47% over than three years) accessing the Web. However, they browsed and purchased the least books.

Most subjects in cluster 3 were males (6394.), master students (46?40)with majors in management (45Yo). They had the most experience (49Y0 over than three years) accessing the Web and were the heaviest users (55?A of them access the Web more than two hours every day).

They spent the most time browsing (373.7 seconds), and read the most books (8.4 books on average),  After the clustering, we explored the association rules based on Algorithm Basic, In the analysis, we set the value of support to be 0,1. For the purpose of verifying the integrated approach proposed in Section 3, we explored association rules based on all subjects with and without clustering separately.

4,2 Association rules and performances evaluation  Tables 4 and 5 show the number of association rules for browsing and purchasing behavior. The total number of association rules is shown in the second row. Because association rules can be divided into different large k- itemsets, we explored them for 2-itemsets, 3-itemsets, and 4-itemsets separately, as shown in both Tables 4 and 5.

Furthermore, we classified all rules into three types: association between books, association between books and categories, and association between categories. We also calculated the three measures, support, confidence, and improvement, for the non-clustering entire data set as well as five clusters separately, The browsing and purchasing results are summarized in Tables 6 and 7 separately. Afterwards, we compared the performance using the number of association rules and different measures.

From Table 4, we can find that the total number of clustering rules (107 rules) was 7.6 times that of non- clustering (14 rules) in browsing. Although the numbers of 2-itemsets rules in cluster 2 (3 rules) was smaller than that in non-clustering (13 rules), there were many more rules in cluster 1 (24 rules) and cluster 3 (45 rules).

Similarly, the numbers of 3-itemsets and 4-itemsets rules increased after clustering. In addition, the integrated approach increased the rules of association between books, books and categories, and categories in clusters 1 and 3.

From Table 5, we can see the same phenomena in terms of purchasing. It is obvious that the integrated approach can determine more detailed rules than exploring association rules without clustering.

??r?to  Next, we cc~mpared the three measures, support, confidence, and improvement, of the non-clustering entire data set with those of the three clusters. That is, we did not compare the rules appearing in the three clusters, only in the non-clustering data set. The first column in Table 6 displays the measures of all association rules in the non- clustering data set. To take the first rule (BO1, L) as an example, cluster 3 has higher support (0.25) than that (0. 11) of the non-clustering data set. A mark ?~? represents the measure that a cluster is higher than that of the non-clustering data set. On the other hand, a mark ? ~? represents the measure that a cluster is lower. The comparisons are summarized in thle bottom row, The same comparisons regarding purchasing are shown in Table 7.

Consider the browsing behavior in Table 6, the integrated approach increases the degree of support and confidence, Among 27 rules, 26 rules in the clusters have higher support, 21 rules in the clusters have higher confidence. However, the proportion of improvement is only 8/27. Comparing the formulas for confidence and improvement, there is an additional denominator, Prob(Y), to calculate improvement. That is, the improvement is a more conservative and rigid measure to evaluate the truth of an association rule. A reasonable inference might be that the integrated approach can increase both Prob(YIX) and Prob(Y), so the improvement cannot be better.

Table 7 shows that although the purchasing behavior non-clustering performance and the clustering performance are similar in terms of the degree of support, the integrated approach can improve both the confidence and improvement, Both proportions for refinement are 3/4. That is, the integrated approach can learn more precise rules to target different customers. Therefore, these results confirm our idea that the integration of clustering and association rules can produce more useful and truthfid rules according to different affinity groups.

This research has provided three results. First, we provided a system framework for customized marketing on the Web according to data sources, data categories, and inference foundations. In the system framework, we suggested using ASP, CGI, and log tile analysis and a search engine to collect customers? data from internal as well as external sites. The user profile is divided into two parts: raw data and refined data. The inference engine learns refined data and marketing rules based on raw data and the site database. The control engine is designed for the recommendation process, The Web server uses ASP or CGI to present a dynamic document based on the recommendation process results. A maintenance interface was designed to assist marketers to manage site contents, programs, and marketing rules. This framework can serve as a basis for designing customized advertising and promotion, etc.

Second, we proposed a group-based approach to customized marketing on the Web. We used association rules instead of induction learning methods to overcome the stochastic problem, interpretation difficulty, with high correlation between attributes and a low response rate. In addition, clustering was proposed based on the marketing segmentation concept. A group-based inference approach using integrating clustering and association rules for the inference engine was proposed. Third, we conducted an experiment to collect data for demonstrating the proposed approach and its performance. The results reveal that our approach can learn both in more detail and with more precise rules.

The performance of the proposed integrated approach may depend on the data to be analyzed. Due to the very diversified and great amount of data, what kind of data and how much data should be used for this integrated approach is a challenging issue. In some sense, this requires the judgement of a domain expert. Further, the performance of applying this approach to customized applications on actual Web sites must be verified by a field experiment.
