AN EFFICIENT ASSOCIATION RULE-BASED METHOD FOR

Abstract - The objective of this work is to develop and  implement a computer-aided decision support system for an  automated diagnosis and classification of ultrasound kidney  images. This approach combines automatically extracted  low-level features from images with high-level knowledge  given by a specialist in order to suggest a diagnosis of a new  kidney image.  The proposed method distinguishes three  kidney categories namely normal, medical renal diseases and  cortical cyst.  The preprocessing technique applied on the  images eliminates the inconsistent data from the US kidney  images. Then feature extraction process is applied to extract  the features from the US kidney images. Feature selection  and discretization process is done on the extracted features  that reduce the mining complexity.  The proposed method  uses a new algorithm ARCKi is a new associative classifier.

This classifies the given image to suggest a diagnosis with  high values of accuracy. The performance of our approach is  compared with multilayer back propagation network in  terms of classifier efficiency with sensibility, specificity and  accuracy.

I.  INTRODUCTION    Recently, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) has  become one of the major research subjects in medical  imaging and diagnostic radiology. The basic idea of CAD  is to provide a computer output as a secondary observer to    assist radiologists and other health care professionals in  image readings.

In this paper, we present a method based on  association rules to help diagnosing medical images. Our  approach has the advantage of selecting only the most  relevant features to be used during the mining process.

Moreover, our approach PreSAGe [1] is optimized  because it performs two different operations in a single  step feature selection and discretization. This makes the  mining algorithm faster, also improving the classification  phase. This approach was applied to kidney images and  the results show high accuracy.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.

Section II presents the background needed to understand  our method. Section III summarizes related works.

Section IV presents our proposed method. Section V  discusses the experiments and results achieved. Finally,  SectionVI summarizes the conclusion of this work.



II. BACKGROUND    The problem of mining association rules was first  stated in [1] as follows. Let I= {i1, i2,..,in} be a set of  literals called items. A set X ? I is called an itemset. Let R  be a table with transactions t involving elements that are  subsets of  I. An association rule is an expression of the  form X ? Y, where X and Y are itemsets. X is called  body or antecedent of the rule, and Y is called head or  consequent of the rule. Let |R| be the number of  transactions in relation R. Let |Z| be the total number of  occurrences of the itemset Z in transactions of relation R.

Support and confidence measures ((1)(2)) are used to  determine the rules returned by the mining process  Support = | XUY| / |R|                 (1)  Confidence = |XUY| / |R|              (2)  The problem of mining association rules, involves  finding rules that satisfy the restrictions of minimum  support and minimum confidence specified by the user.

Mining image content demands extraction of the main  image features regarding a specific criterion. Image  processing algorithms are used to extract such relevant  features from the images, organizing them in feature  vectors. The feature vectors are then employed in place of    the images to model them as transactions, which are then  used in the mining process. Features quantify intrinsic  visual characteristics of the images,  leading to vectors  with hundreds or even thousands of elements. Contrary to  what one would think, having a large number of features  can be a problem. Thus, to avoid decreasing the  discrimination accuracy, keeping the number of features  as low as possible is important, and this establishes a  tradeoff between the discrimination power and the feature  vector size.



III. RELATED WORK    Brijesh Verma et al. [2] Presented a system based on  fuzzy-neural and feature extraction techniques for  detecting and diagnosing microcalcifications patterns in  digital mammograms. The various feature extraction  techniques have been investigated and analyzed. It has  been shown that a combination of three features, such as  entropy, standard deviation and number of pixels,  distinguishes a benign microcalcification pattern from  malignant appreciably.   In [4] a water immersion method  978-1-4244-5967-4/10/$26.00 2010 IEEE    with the guidance of a domain expert is used to detect  objects (regions of interest of brain images).

Representative features of the brain images (gray level,  area, location, elongation, and direction) are  used in the  mining process. Most algorithms used in medical image  analysis [6] & [7] are generally based on classification  methods. Relevant research that applies association rules  for medical image analysis is discussed in this section.

An automated method for differentiating malignant  from benign masses has been suggested in [9]. In this  method, 95 mammograms depicting masses in 65 patients  were digitized. The features were extracted related to the  margin and density of each mass from the neighborhoods  of the computer-identified mass regions. Using three  automated classifiers, the selected features were merged  into an estimated likelihood of malignancy. The  performance of the classifiers was evaluated by receiver  operating characteristic and compared with experienced    mammographer. A CAD scheme has also been proposed  [10] to improve radiologists performance in breast cancer  diagnosis. The scheme estimates the likelihood of  malignancy for clustered microcalcification based on  eight computer-extracted features obtained from  mammograms. The comparison was made between the  CAD scheme and unaided routine.

Association    rules    are   used    in    [6]   to   classify  mammograms.  First, three features of shape are extracted  from each image. A record  combining  the image features        Fig. 1: A CAD system for US Kidney images  and the image classification (benign or malignant) is  generated for each image. The features are discretized in  ten equal-sized intervals in order to be applied to an  association mining algorithm. The rules are mined with  the restriction of not having a classification item in the  body part. A new image is classified according to the  number of rules matched and the confidence of the rules.

A drawback of this technique is the discretization process,  which uses intervals of the same size. This can imply the  loss of significant information to mine rules with high  confidence. In [8], two types of decision support systems,  optimized multi-layer back propagation network and  hybrid fuzzy-neural system have been developed with  these features for classifying the kidney categories. The  performance of the hybrid fuzzy-neural system is  compared with the optimized multi-layer back  propagation network in terms of classification efficiency,  training and testing time.

The realization of CAD system for US kidney image  is in high demand. An attempt has been made, in the  present work, for the first time to implement a CAD  system using association rule mining that facilitates  automated classification of US kidney images of three  categories namely normal (NR), medical renal diseases  (MRD) and cortical cysts (CC) with an intention to help  the medical experts to perform unbiased diagnosis and to  meet few possibilities of CAD system.



IV. PROPOSED WORK  COMPUTER AIDED  DIAGNOSIS OF ULTRASOUND KIDNEY IMAGES  The CAD system design requires four main areas for  its implementation (a) general processing techniques, (b)  preprocessing algorithms for segmentation of anatomical  structures, (c) analysis and (d) Decision support system  aimed at solving a particular task or application, usually  an attempt to detect a specific kind of abnormality [11].

This necessitates developing a structured procedure to  realize a computer-aided human kidney diagnosis system  as shown in the Fig. 1.   It can be noticed that the  following sub-division are included in the areas to meet  requirements of present application,    General processing:  ? Image acquisition and digitization  ? Image quality verification and re-acquisition  Pre-processing:  ? Segmentation of kidney region  ? Image rotation  ? Unbounded pixel elimination  Analysis:  ? Feature extraction  ? Feature discretization and Selection (using  PreSAGe Algorithm)  ? Generating Feature vectors  Decision Support System:  ? Mining Association Rules  ? Classifying the image using ARCKi algorithm.

The images acquired using US scanning system are  given as input to the devised CAD system. The purpose of  pre-processing,  the acquired image is to retain the pixels  of kidney region, so that extracted features describe the  tissue characteristics of kidney precisely. The analysis  part is to begin with depends on the feature extraction  techniques used for obtaining the content descriptive  features. The extracted features and class labels are  submitted the PreSAGe (Pre-processing Solution for  Association rule Generation) algorithm [1], which  removes irrelevant features from the feature vector and    gives a discretization of the remaining features. In  decision support system, the transaction representations of  all the images in the training set are submitted to Apriori  algorithm, limiting the minimum confidence to high  values to generate association rules. Then a classifier  ARCKi is created using the association rules. The feature  vector of the test image is submitted to the ARCKi  algorithm, which classifies the given image into a  particular category.

A.  US kidney images  The images used for the analysis are acquired from  two types of scanning systems namely, ATL HDI 5000  curvilinear probe with transducer frequency of 36 MHz  and Wipro GE LOGIC 400 curvilinear probe with  transducer frequency of 35 MHz. As the sonographic  evaluation is made based on the distribution of echogenity  that reflects tissue characteristics, for better echo  visualization the longitudinal cross section of kidney is  taken to include renal sinus, medulla and cortex regions as  suggested by the experts. In total, 150 images with 50  images in each category are obtained from male and  female subjects of age 4515 years for training and 78  images with 26 images in each category is acquired under  the  same  age group for testing. The images of both right  and left kidneys are considered for the analysis. The  necessary clinical information of the training images are  documented.

B.  Kidney diseases  The kidney diseases are usually categorized as  hereditary, congenital   or acquired.   The most common  hereditary disorder is cystic diseases which includes  simple renal cyst and complex renal cyst or polycyst [12,  13]. The kidneys affected with these diseases are  considered under CC category. The sonographic features  of renal cyst include a well defined mass lesion, smooth  wall and circular hypo echoic mass with good through  transmission. Any congenital or acquired  kidney  diseases  typically  cause renal  infection and/or destruction of  kidney tissues that may  lead  to  end  stage chronic  renal  failure are considered under MRD category. Due to tissue    destruction, anatomical separation between renal sinus,  medulla and cortex becomes difficult. The sonographic  evaluation    shows   hyper   echoic kidney region with  increased cortical echogenity and differentiation between  cortex and collecting system is poor.

C. Pre-processing of US kidney image    The pre-processing procedure prior to feature  extraction must be formulated such that the sonographic  information of kidney region is preserved. Hence care  must taken to ascertain, no alteration occur in the spatial  gray level distribution of kidney region. The pre-  processing procedure that concerns above requirement  involved three steps, are image segmentation, image  rotation and unbounded pixel elimination.

Segmentation is a fundamental process for higher  level medical image analysis. For the present CAD system  realization, i-HSIC segmentation scheme [14] has been  used for contouring the kidney region of different kidney  categories. This scheme is preferred as mentioned it  provides a general solution for contouring.  In the  acquired image, kidney may geometrically be viewed as  elliptic. The visual inspection confirms that the major axis  makes an angle ? (called as angle of inclination) with  respect to the horizontal or reference axis and it varies  anywhere between 0 to 180.

Before feature extraction, the images are rotated along  the horizontal axis to ensure ?=0 for maintaining  uniformity in image representation and avoiding influence  of varied orientation on features. The estimation of major  axis orientation and angle of inclination ? is made by  using the contour co-ordinates of i-HSIC. Followed by the  segmentation and rotation, it becomes necessary to  eliminate the superfluous echoes that lie outside the  kidney region to make the features content descriptive.

The pixels enclosed by the contour are considered to be  POI or bounded pixel and pixels that lies outside the  contour are regarded as unbounded or noise pixels.

Discarding the unbounded pixels results in a pre-  processed image I(x, y) that contains only the POI.

Further analytical details on pre-processing procedure and    explanations may be referred in [15].

C.  Feature Extraction    The features of texture proposed in [16] are extracted  from images and organized into feature vectors. To  perform the extraction, a co-occurrence matrix of the  analyzed image is generated. A co-occurrence matrix  M(d, ?) is given by the relative frequency of occurrences  of two gray-level pixels and , separated by pixels in the  orientation. First, the gray levels of the images are  reduced to 16. Co-occurrence matrices are calculated for  the directions of 0, 45, 90, and 135 and for the distances 1,  2, 3, 4, and 5. Twenty matrices of 16 X 16 integer  elements per image are produced. For each matrix, the  following seven features are calculated, producing a  feature vector of 140 elements to represent each image.

Step          =    ?i ?j P (i, j)      (3)  Variance =    ?i ?j (i-j) 2 P (i, j)    (4)      Entropy    =    ?i ?j P (i, j) log (P (i, j))    (5)  Energy     =    ?i ?j P (i, j) 2                             (6)  Homogeneity = ?i ?j P (i-j) / (1+|i-j|)     (7)  3o Moment     = ?i ?j(i-j) 3P (i, j)     (8)  Inverse Variance = ?i ?j P (i-j) / (i-j) 2     (9)    D. ARCKi (Generation of Association Rules with High  Confidence for Kidney images) Algorithm  ARCKi is well-suited to generate suggestions for  diagnoses. This section presented our proposed method.

The knowledge of specialists should also be considered  during the processing of mining medical images in order  to validate the results. The extracted features of the test  image and the feature vector generated can be submitted  to the classifier, which uses the association rules and  generates set of keywords to compose the diagnosis of a  test image. Algorithm for ARCKi is given below,    Input: Feature vector F of the test image, threshold ?  Output: set of keywords S  Method:    (1)  for each rule r ? R of the form body ? head do  (2) {  for each itemset x ? head do  (3) {   if  body matches F  then  (4)  increase the number of matches by 1  (5) else  (6) increase the number of non matches by 1  (7) }}  // to generate keywords  (8)  for each rule r ? R of the form body ? head do  (9) {   for each item set x ? R head do  (10) {  (11) if (nM(x)h / (nM(x) + nN(x))) ? ? then  (12) if  x?S  then  (13) add x in S  (14) } }  (15) return S    This classifier returns the multiple classes when  processing a test image. The algorithm developed has  been employed to generate suggestions for diagnosis. This  algorithm stores all item sets (i.e. Set of keywords)  belonging to the head of the rules in a data structure. An  item set h is returned in the suggested diagnosis if the  condition is satisfied as the given equation    nM(x)  ? ?   (10)  nM(x) + nN(x)    techniques that are applied in the training phase like pre-  processing and feature extraction are also applied for the  new test image. The images of the test set and the  association rules generated were submitted to ARCKi  algorithm with ? = 0.001. Depending on the output of the  ARCKi algorithm the image is classified as either normal  where nM(x) is the number of matches of the itemset and  nN(x) is the number of not-matches. A threshold ? is  employed to limit the minimal number of matches  required to return  an  itemset  in the  suggested diagnosis.

A match occurs when the image features satisfy the body  part of the rule.

E.  Performance evaluation criteria  We use the measures of accuracy, sensitivity and  specificity to quantify the effectiveness of the proposed  method in suggesting diagnoses of US kidney images..

The measures are described in ((11)  (13)). The possible  outcomes of a two class prediction be represented as True  positive (TP), True negative (TN), False Positive (FP) and  False Negative (FN). The normal and abnormal images  are correctly classified as True Positive and True Negative  respectively. A False Positive is when the outcome is  incorrectly classified as positive(yes) when it is a  negative(no). False Positive is the False alarm in the  classification process. A false negative is when the  outcome is incorrectly predicted as negative when it  should have been in fact positive.

Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN+ FP+FN) (11)  Sensitivity = TP /  (TP + FN)           (12)  Specificity = TN / (TN + FP)   (13)

V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS  The dataset consists of 150 images with 50 images in  each category are obtained from male and female subjects  of age 4515 years for training and 78 images with 26  images in each category is acquired under the same age  group for testing. The images of both right and left  kidneys are considered for the analysis. The dataset was  divided in two parts: the training set that is composed of  60 images (40% of dataset) and the test set that is  composed of 90 images (60% of dataset). For all 60  training set kidney image features are extracted and they  are applied to PreSAGe algorithm, with parameters:  minperint = 6, mintofuse = 0.8 and valreduct = 17% which  are tuning parameters set by the user. PreSAGe selects 24  features as the most relevant ones, obtaining a reduction  of 83% in  the feature   vector  size. Then  feature vector  is formed for the selected features and association rules  are generated by using Apriori algorithm. The value of  minimum  confidence was  set to 99% and  minimum  support was set to  10%.  In  the  test  phase  the  new  test  image   that  has  to be  diagnosed  is  taken  and   also  the  (NR) or medical renal diseases (MRD) or cortical cysts    (CC). The performance of our approach is compared with  multilayer back propagation network in terms of classifier  efficiency with sensibility, specificity and accuracy. The  results are shown in table I.

In this paper we presented a method, which is based  on association rules, to generate suggestions for diagnosis  of medical images, and which can be integrated into a  CAD. Our approach is divided into four main steps:  general processing techniques, preprocessing algorithms  for segmentation of anatomical structures, analysis and  Decision support system. The third step uses an algorithm  called PreSAGe, which executes two tasks in a single  step: feature selection and discretization. The feature    selection process speeds up and reduces the complexity of  the whole method, making it faster than traditional  approaches. The last step is performed by the ARCKi  algorithm, which generates a suggested diagnosis to a test  image. The result of the proposed method is compared  with multilayer back propagation network(MBPN) in  terms of classifier efficiency with sensibility, specificity  and accuracy. The results show that the proposed method  achieves high sensitivity (up to 94%) and accuracy (up to  93%) in the task of supporting decision making. As the  input images are quantified by numerical value it is  possible to, create a universal reference for all three  categories, make comparative study on values obtained to  decide on category and know the extent of pathology  involved. It is also believed the proposed CAD system  may assist the physician to predict future possibility of  normal subject becoming abnormal based on feature  value. Such a computer-aided system helps the physician  to study extensively the tissue property of kidney more  reliably which finds broad clinical application.
