The Effect of Using a Semantic Wiki for Metadata Management:  A Controlled Experiment

Abstract A coherent and consistent understanding of corporate data is an important factor for effective management of diversified companies and implies a need for company- wide unambiguous data definitions. Inspired by the success of Wikipedia, wiki software has become a broadly discussed alternative for corporate metadata management. However, in contrast to the performance and sustainability of wikis in general, benefits of using semantic wikis have not been investigated sufficiently.

The paper at hand presents results of a controlled experiment that investigates effects of using a semantic wiki for metadata management in comparison to a classical wiki. Considering threats to validity, the analysis (i.e. 74 subjects using both a classical and a semantic wiki) shows that the semantic wiki is superior to the classical variant regarding information retrieval tasks. At the same time, the results indicate that more effort is needed to build up the semantically annotated wiki content in the semantic wiki.

1. Introduction  1.1. Corporate metadata management  Effective management of diversified companies im- plies coherent and consistent understanding of corpo- rate data. Logistics processes harmonized on a global level, global procurement strategies, integrated service management, and compliance with regulatory and legal requirements needs company-wide unambiguous data definitions.

Being able to work with high-quality data is pivotal to enable service-oriented business applications [24, p.

4], help increase the validity of strategic decisions [29, pp. 23 ff.], and allow for high regulatory compliance [8, p. 5]. Metadata of high quality are the basis for re- trieving, managing, evaluating, and using appropriate information through precise queries, as they increase user confidence in data and improve decision-making  quality [22, pp. 18 ff.]. In this respect, metadata man- agement refers to assigning standard (textual) defini- tions to data, and to maintenance of such data in a cen- tralized dictionary or metadata repository [6, p. 165], such as a (semantic) wiki.

1.2. Business scenario  In cooperation with a chemical company, we are con- ducting a Design Research project [10, 21] for devel- oping a central metadata repository. The company is running a global process harmonization project and is planning to establish a central single point of truth for master data. In this project, the company needs harmo- nized and comprehensible data definitions in order to provide guidance for users (i.e. users of SAP systems maintaining materials, vendor, and customer master data) that work in newly harmonized business processes. The repository is intended to be used world- wide by about 6.000 users for support purposes.

A central metadata repository is already in place providing information on company-specific SAP data fields and transactions. This repository is supposed to be used by SAP users for clarifying the usage of par- ticular SAP data fields, forms, and transactions. How- ever, acceptance and usability of this tool are low.

Some problems of the current solution were identified in focus group interviews [3, pp. 153?158]: information retrieval is too time consuming, search and navigation functionality is poor, information is not up to date, metadata is not integrated with business processes.

Considering the interview results, the company decided to use a wiki for a new version of the metadata reposi- tory. This decision was based on the assumption that the wiki could increase the willingness of employees to maintain support information and to exchange expe- riences. These expected effects are supposed to im- prove timeliness of information and increase the num- ber of users. However, the evaluation of this assump- tion is part of ongoing research. The paper at hand dis- cusses whether or not to use a semantic The prior deci-      sion to use wiki based software for a new version of the metadata repository is considered as a given fact.

Focus group interviews about design alternatives [10, pp. 88 f.] for wiki based software results in con- siderations whether or not to use a semantic wiki in- stead of a classical wiki (cf. Section 2.2). Due to uncer- tainty about the impact of functionality that is only provided by a semantic wiki, we decided to conduct a controlled experiment to investigate positive or nega- tive effects of the use of a semantic wiki. This experi- ment was not intended to evaluate the above mentioned wiki-based metadata repository, but to indicate whether or not a semantic wiki is able to overcome supposed drawbacks of a common wiki in general. The intended contribution is to empirically confirm supposed effects in order to provide decision support for wiki develop- ment projects. An empirical evaluation of the men- tioned Design Research project and a comparison with the findings presented in this paper is part of future work.

Considering the interview results mentioned above, we decided to focus on information maintenance and information retrieval. Research to date has tended to focus on effects of using classical wikis in corporate context [20, 23, 26, 33, 35]. So far, however, there has been little empirical research on effects of using se- mantic wikis for metadata management.

The paper at hand presents the results of a con- trolled experiment on the effect of using a semantic wiki for metadata management. In particular, we inves- tigated how enhanced wiki functionality affects 1) time needed to accomplish certain tasks and 2) subjects? assessments regarding effort and usability. In Section 2, we outline our understanding of metadata and give some background information on (semantic) wiki tech- nology used for the experiment. Section 3 explains the rationale behind the chosen experiment design and gives information on the experiment?s implementation and progression. In Section 4, we present the main re- sults of the statistical analysis and we discuss possible threats to validity of the results. Section 5 provides a summary and discusses future work.

2. Background  2.1. Definition of metadata  Metadata can be defined in general as data that de- scribe the meaning and the properties of other data demarcating them from other data types, such as trans- action and master data [2, p. 1213]. More precisely, we use the term to determine important characteristics that need to be known for both database and application engineering [7, p. 482], or for general, semantically unambiguous understanding of data within an organi- zation. Metadata, accordingly, facilitate identification,  detection, use, and management of data as they allow an organization to better understand its data sources and definitions. Tozer [31, p. xix] summarizes their function by ?seeing metadata as the means by which the structure and behavior of data is recorded, con- trolled, and published across an organization?. The most comprehensive definition is provided by Marco [22, p. 5], who describes metadata as ?all physical data and knowledge from inside and outside an organiza- tion, including information about the physical data, technical and business processes, rules and constraints of the data, and structures of the data used by a corpo- ration?.

From a data management perspective, metadata is any information that supports effective use of data, including information that can facilitate data manage- ment (e.g. data authentication, data sequence, data type, or key field indicators), data access and data analysis (e.g. format for data mining, visualization) [2, p. 1212].

2.2. Wikis and semantic wikis  Wiki is a piece of server software that allows users to freely create and edit web page content using any web browser. Wiki supports hyperlinks and has simple text syntax (wiki markup or wikitext) for creating new pag- es and cross-links between internal wiki pages on the fly [5]. Further typical features are version control (his- tory management) as well as search and navigation functionality. It has to be mentioned that the term wiki does not refer to specific software or technology but to the concept of web based, collaborative collection, organization, and provision of information.

Wikis have become popular tools for collaboration on the web, and many online communities employ wikis to exchange knowledge. For a majority of wikis, public or not, primary goals are to organize and to share the knowledge collected [17, p. 251].

One of the best known examples of a wiki is the multilingual, free encyclopedia Wikipedia1, which every user can edit. Due to rather primitive features for searching information provided by the Wikipedia soft- ware, Kr?tzsch et al. [16] proposed a more structured approach and started an open-source software project to develop an enhanced wiki engine (i.e. an extension of the wiki engine MediaWiki2 that is used for Wikipe- dia). This software, called Semantic MediaWiki3 (SMW), can be classified as a semantic wiki. Both MediaWiki and SMW are mentioned here as they are used for our experiment (i.e. the classical wikis are provided by installations of MediaWiki, while the se-   1 http://www.wikipedia.org 2 http://www.mediawiki.org 3 http://www.semantic-mediawiki.org      mantic wikis are provided by installations of Media- Wiki and the SMW extension).

Unlike classical wikis, semantic wikis provide a structured representation of their content, mostly en- coded in RDF based languages [26, 30, p. 88]. Based on this additional information structure, enhanced search and navigation functionality is provided. As there is no comprehensive classification of semantic wiki functionality, we just provide information on SMW as a representative of semantic wikis. Please note that there are more semantically enhanced wiki engines (e.g. MaknaWiki [25], MILK wiki [26] and IkeWiki [27]), providing further features, e.g., for col- laborative ontology editing or document publishing.

However, such features are not in the focus of the business scenario mentioned in Section 1.2). For more information, Buffa et al. [1] present a state-of -the-art of semantic wikis. A case study on the management of corporate manufacturing metadata is presented by Mul- jadi et al. [23, pp. 271. ff.].

Figure 1 shows a page with information about Gor- gonzola cheese that was used in the experiment (i.e. in the semantic wikis). SMW uses additional markup to annotate the content of a wiki page [17, pp. 254 f.] In the classical wiki, a link from the Gorgonzola page to the page about Piedmont looks like this: [[Piedmont]] (MediaWiki markup). With SMW, one can add a meaning to this link by adding some additional mark- up: [[Production Region::Piedmont]]. The enhanced wiki engine parses the annotated wikitext and builds a data structure based on the additional information (i.e.

a directed graph with a labeled relation (Production Region) from Gorgonzola to Piedmont).

Figure 2 shows an SMW special page that is avail- able for all semantically annotated pages. It provides information already available on the content page (i.e.

in the Facts about box, cf. Figure 1) in a condensed representation. This extracted information is intended to increase the wiki?s usability regarding navigation and information retrieval.

3. Research methodology  3.1. Research objective  We conducted a controlled experiment with an AB/BA cross-over design. Background information on this design is given in Section 3.3. Regarding the underly- ing Design Research project mentioned in Section 1.2, we identified the following two research questions: How is a wiki?s usability affected by functionality  which is enabled by semantically annotated wiki content?

What additional effort is needed to semantically annotate wiki content?

3.2. Scenario   As already mentioned, we focus on real-world me- tadata management scenarios where users are familiar with the underlying data model. One example of such a scenario is company-specific support for an SAP sys- tem, where the wiki contains information on how to use specific SAP data fields (e.g. the sales tax ID as part of supplier master data). For that reason, we tried to minimize the effort necessary to understand given tasks by using a simple, plain scenario. We chose an ontology about pizzas, which is also used for education and training purposes in the context of ontology editing software [13]. More precisely, we used a subset of this ontology: We only selected information about pizzas, their toppings, and the spiciness of pizza toppings. We mapped this information to an appropriate wiki repre- sentation. The wikis contain pages for several pizzas (e.g. Pizza Capricciosa) and pizza toppings (e.g. Gor- gonzola cheese, cf. Figure 1). Relations (e.g. between pizzas and their toppings) are determined by the page content (classical wiki) and by semantic annotations (semantic wiki), respectively.

Figure 2. Enhanced navigation enabled by semantically annotated wiki content    Figure 1. Semantically annotated wiki page       3.3. Experiment design  Regarding our research questions, we needed to take measurements on comparable subjects under different conditions: a classical wiki on the one hand, and a se- mantic wiki on the other hand. To control the treatment of subjects, we designed a controlled experiment [4, p.

181 ff.] with the following parameters (more detailed information on the tasks TFind, TCollect and TLink is given in Section 3.4): Independent variables: For two tasks (TFind, TCollect),  we controlled the wiki?s functionality. Subjects had to accomplish the same tasks with both a classical and a semantic wiki. For another task (TLink), we controlled the scope of the task (adding classical links vs. semantic annotations).

Dependent variables: We measured the subjects? assessments regarding effort and usability in trying to accomplish the given tasks by taking ratings on an interval scale (1?9). Furthermore, we measured the time needed for each task to be accomplished.

We consider these variables to serve as proper indi- cators of the shortcomings identified with regard to the metadata repository currently in use (cf. inter- view results mentioned in Section 1.2).

Given three tasks and three dependent variables, we can formulate nine null hypotheses for our controlled experiment: No difference in time needed to accomplish TFind,  TCollect, and TLink.

No difference in effort ratings for TFind, TCollect, and  TLink.

No difference in usability ratings for TFind, TCollect,  and TLink.

To achieve higher statistical power [19, p. 80] and to ensure internal validity [28, pp. 35 ff.], we decided to use a repeated-measures design for our controlled ex- periment. In a repeated-measures design, subjects re- ceive two or more treatments (modification of con- trolled variables). Even with high subject variability, there will be almost always a positive correlation [14, p. 181].

A shortcoming of repeated-measures design is the occurrence of carry-over effects [9, p. 318]. Carry-over effects can occur in two ways: practice effects and se- quence effects. In our context, practice effects can oc- cur because subjects might not have used a wiki in the past. Therefore, it is plausible that in the second run subjects will exhibit better performance than in the first run because they had some practice with a wiki, re- gardless of the wiki type. When confronted with a se- quence effect, the effect of the first treatment persists and thus contaminates the measurements on the second treatment. Results of our analysis to identify carry-over effects are given in Section 4.2.

To err on the conservative side, we used a counter- balanced repeated-measures design (i.e. an AB/BA cross-over design [28, pp. 46?50]). With counterba- lancing, all possible orders of treatments are consi- dered and subject groups are randomly assigned to one of the treatment sequences. The effect of counterba- lancing is to spread the unwanted variance arising from interference through practice or sequence effects [4, p.

212?228]. Furthermore, an explicit test for carry-over effects is conducted during our analysis to check if any such effects persisted despite the counterbalancing.

3.4. Experiment implementation  Participants were members of an applied research pro- gram as well as employees and consultants that are involved in data quality management. All subjects could be classified as interested in the context of data quality. We had a set of 279 potential participants from more than 80 different companies, which were ran- domly assigned to two groups (GA, GB). Random as- signment can be regarded as a method of experimental control because it is assumed that over large numbers of subjects uncontrolled factors are distributed evenly over the treatment conditions [34, pp. 261?262].

The experiment was conducted in April 2008. Each subject received an email containing a short introduc- tion, the URLs of two wikis (i.e. a classical and a se- mantic wiki) and a link to an online survey. As we used an address repository that was built up during the last two years, the address data was not free of errors.

Since 31 emails could not be delivered, the size of the sample was reduced to 248 (128 in GA and 120 in GB). Due to some technical problems during the first two days, 13 data sets could not be considered in the analysis. Finally, we received 74 analyzable results (39 in GA and 35 in GB), which corresponds to a response rate of 29 %. It has to be noted that there are smaller sample sizes in some cases as not all subjects accom- plished each task. For some statistical calculations, it is also necessary to consider only those subjects that have accomplished a task in both the classical and the se- mantic wiki.

For each participant, we prepared two wikis: a clas- sical wiki and a semantic wiki. We used the wiki en- gine MediaWiki for both wikis. For the semantic wiki, we also installed the SMW extension (cf. Section 2.2).

Copies of the wikis used (i.e. the classical wiki4 and the semantic wiki5) are available online. Furthermore, we asked all participants to assess the wikis? usability and the effort needed to accomplish certain tasks. (cf. de- pendent variables in Section 3.3). Besides the ratings, we implemented a logging extension for the wikis that   4 http://wiki.iwi.unisg.ch/experiment/ClassicalWiki 5 http://wiki.iwi.unisg.ch/experiment/SemanticWiki      saves timestamps for several wiki actions (i.e. view, edit, and save actions). With these timestamps, we could estimate the time necessary to accomplish the given tasks. The following subsections describe the three tasks each subject had to accomplish in both the classical and the semantic wiki.

3.4.1. ?Find Content? Task (TFind). We asked the sub- jects to go to five wiki pages. For this task, the classic- al wikis only provide indexed search functionality and links between wiki pages. Besides search and link functionality, the semantic wikis also provide a factbox that summarizes semantically annotated data of a page (cf. Figure 1) and further navigation support mentioned in Section 2.2 (cf. Figure 2). In order to simulate cor- porate scenarios, we asked to visit semantically related pages (e.g. a specific pizza and afterwards a pizza with a similar topping).

3.4.2. ?Collect Information? Task (TCollect). We asked the subjects to collect all wiki pages about pizzas that have at least one hot topping (referred to as hot pizzas).

The spiciness information was only given in the page text of a pizza topping. In the classical wikis, the sub- jects had to read all pizza topping pages for identifying hot pizzas. In the semantic wikis, we additionally pro- vided a GUI based interface for intuitive assembly of ask queries.

3.4.3. ?Link Information? Task (TLink). We asked the subjects to add missing links into a specific wiki page.

The text without links was already included. In the semantic wikis, subjects also were asked to semantical- ly annotate the added links.

4. Results and analysis  4.1. Statistical background  For this paper, we have visualized some of the most important results by means of box plots [32, p. 39 ff.].

The box of a certain plot contains 50 % of the data points. The lower / upper border of the box marks the 25 % / 75 % quantile. The lower / upper t-bar marks the most extreme data point which is not more than 1.5 times the length of the box away from the lower / up- per edge of the box. Outliers from the above scheme are visualized by circles. The median is marked with a thick line.

We used the non-parametric one-sided two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test [12, pp. 106 ff.] for evaluation as we did not assume a certain distribution (e.g. a nor- mal distribution for both data sets) in general. Besides the tolerance for different distributions, this test is also recommended for both ordinal and interval scaled data  (despite introductions to assume constant spacing for the rating scale, we cannot assume homogenous inter- val scaled data). The statistical power of the Wilcoxon test is in the worst case 13.6 % smaller than the power of the corresponding t-test [12, p. 139]. This reduction factor is considered for all power calculations in this section. However, all statistical power calculations result in values close to ?1?. The reason for these high statistical power values can be found in very small p- values (cf. Section 4.3).

We only conducted statistical analysis for TFind and TLink, because we did not receive enough comparable data sets for TCollect (cf. Section 4.4).

4.2. Cross-over analysis  We applied the Hills-Armitage approach [11, p. 12?15] to analyze carry-over effects of the experiment. This regression method is recommended to analyze data from cross-over experiments [28, p. 47]. The approach is based on treating the experimental sequence order as a dummy variable that, in our case, takes the value ?<1? for data points of GA and ?1? for data points of GB.

The test is legitimate regardless of whether just one or both of the effects (i.e. practice and sequence effect) is present. However, the test is incapable of discriminat- ing between the two effects [18, p. 416]. After a re- gression analysis, the gradient coefficient of the regres- sion line can be seen as an indicator of a carry-over effect. More precisely, one can determine the signific- ance of the effect by calculating the distance of the coefficient from zero. Table 1 shows the cross-over analysis results (abbr.: RC (regression coefficient), SE (standard error), t (t-value), P (probability > |t|), TE (treatment effect), CE (carry-over effect). Significance level: 5 %).

Results of the regression analysis presented in Ta- ble 1 indicate that the mean difference between values of GA and GB (i.e. the values for TE in column RC) is significantly different from zero for all dependent va- riables (i.e. p < 0.001 for effort, usability, and time).

This suggests that the semantic wiki is superior to the  Table 1.

A more detailed analysis of the treatment effect is given in the follow- ing subsections. A significant carry-over effect could not be determined: All p-values (cf. values for CE in column P) are greater than the chosen significance lev- el of 0.05.

4.3. Analysis of TFind and TLink  For the analysis, we considered 61 subjects (32 in GA and 29 in GB) regarding TFind and 62 subjects (32 in GA and 30 in GB) regarding TLink. Table 2 summarizes mean, standard deviation, correlation coefficients, and results of a significance analysis regarding TFind and TLink (abbr.: CW (common wiki), SW (semantic wiki), SD (standard deviation), Corr (Spearman?s rank corre- lation coefficient)). P-values calculated by the Wilcox- on test all are smaller than 0.001.

Figure 3 and Figure 4 show box plots of the sub- jects? ratings regarding usability and effort for TFind.

The box plots show that subjects using a semantic wiki gave higher ratings regarding usability and lower rat- ings regarding effort than subjects using the classical wiki. These results are consistent with the time mea- surements: Almost all subjects accomplished TFind faster in the semantic wiki than in the classical wiki (cf. Fig- ure 5). All these results are strongly significant (p < 0.001 for effort, usability, and time).

Results for TLink are also significant (p < 0.001 for effort, usability, and time), yet this time it is the other way round. The box plots in Figure 3 and Figure 4 and the scatter plot in Figure 6 show that subjects using a semantic wiki gave lower ratings and needed more time to accomplish TLink than subjects using a classical  wiki. Besides a significant distance, there is a signifi- cant positive correlation between each pair of data sets.

Values of the Spearman?s rank correlation coefficient for all data set pairs are given in Table 2.

In summary, all null hypotheses regarding TFind and TLink have to be rejected. Regarding any threats to valid- ity (cf. Section 4.5), the semantic wiki performs better for TFind while it shows lower performance for TLink.

4.4. Analysis of TCollect  Regarding TCollect, we have too few comparable data sets for significant statistical analysis. Obviously, the given task was too hard to accomplish. Only six subjects tried to accomplish TCollect in the classical wiki. Any of these subjects achieved an acceptable result. With the semantic wiki, 61 subjects (31 in GA and 30 in GB) tried to accomplish the task. It is interesting to note that all seven subjects of GA (remember: classical wiki before semantic wiki) that aborted the experiment were lost while trying to accomplish TCollect in the classical wiki. Subjects of GB also aborted TCollect in the classical wiki but continued with trying to accomplish TLink.

It has to be noted that the task had to be accomplished by creating an ask statement. Though the semantic wiki provides a query interface to support subjects (cf. Figure 7), it is remarkable that 61 subjects tried to use this interface and 42 of them (24 in GA and 18 in GB) succeeded in doing so. Despite this interesting observation, we can- not draw any significant conclusion whether or not to reject the null hypotheses regarding TCollect.

4.5. Threats to validity  It is the nature of any empirical study that assumptions are made which later on restrict the validity of the re- sults. In this subsection, we discuss these assumptions that impose threats to internal and external validity.

4.5.1. Internal Validity. Threats to internal validity are those factors that may affect the value of the de- pendent variables apart from the independent variable [15, p. 732]. Effects regarding selection, maturation, instrumentation, and presentation can be considered as not relevant when using a crossover design with ran- dom allocation to sequence which is designed to avoid these problems [28, pp. 35 ff.]. However, using a cross-over design is problematic if there is an interac- tion between sequence and treatment. Considering this threat, we conducted a cross-over analysis that is dis- cussed in Section 4.2. Results of this analysis do not indicate significant cross-over effects.

4.5.2. External Validity. Threats to external validity are those factors that may limit the applicability of the  experimental results to industry practice [4, p. 360].

Our experiment considered three threats to external validity: participant representativeness, scenario repre- sentativeness, and task representativeness.

Participant representativeness is an issue, because all participants are more or less interested in the topic of data quality management. This characteristic cannot be assumed in general for users of wiki based metadata management software. Nevertheless, the familiarity with (semantic) wikis was low: All subjects stated to read on Wikipedia, but nobody had ever written some content. Only twelve subjects (16 %) knew the Me- diaWiki software before the experiment, only one stated to use it. Regarding SMW, only three subjects (4 %) stated to know the software.

Of course, the scenario cannot be generalized to in- dustrial practice except to pizzeria businesses. Regard- ing this threat, we need to discuss whether or not the complexity of the scenario can be viewed as a valid representation for a real-world scenario. One important factor at this point is the knowledge of real-world em- ployees about their specific tasks. For our experiment, we tried to compensate the missing knowledge about the arbitrary scenario with lower complexity. However, one valid argument threatens the results regarding TFind: The semantic wiki can only expedite a user?s work process, if the information needed is semantically con-  150 200 250      classical  wiki (seconds)  se m  an tic  w ik  i ( se  co nd  s)  Group A Group B  Figure 5.

SMW query Interface      nected (due to the search and navigation support that is based on semantic annotations).

When discussing the representativeness of the ex- periment?s results, we must admit that the effects iden- tified are certainly dependent on the software that was used. All tasks defined addressed specific features of SMW (i.e. extracted information to enhance naviga- tion, the query interface, or the SMW markup).

4.6. Discussion  We identified a significant difference between the per- formance of the classical wikis and the performance of the semantic wikis, while certain threats to validity have been taken into consideration. As the experiment was intended to provide decision support as to whether or not using a semantic wiki (i.e. the SMW extension for a MediaWiki based wiki) is beneficial for metadata management, we discuss the results in the context of the Design Research project mentioned in Section 1.2.

The experiment?s results indicate that information retrieval is faster and easier when extending MediaWi- ki with SMW. At the same time, the effort for informa- tion maintenance increases due to additionally needed semantic annotations in the wiki content. When trying to draw conclusions from these findings, one has to consider specific characteristics of the corporate scena- rio focused. If the intended effect is to facilitate content creation, a classical wiki would be the better choice. If the wiki is supposed to facilitate information retrieval and the utilization of contained information, a semantic wiki is preferable. Besides this consideration, technical aspects (e.g. integration of wiki content into further applications [23, 26]) have to be taken into account.

In the business scenario mentioned in Section 1.2, the clear focus is on information retrieval as the num- ber of content users exceeds the number of intended content authors (i.e. 6.000 vs. 90). For that reason, the identified effects concerning TFind are regarded to be more important than increasing effort for content au- thors. However, the evaluation of these expectations is part of future work. At this point, we just want to out- line how the experiment?s findings can contribute to given wiki development projects.

5. Conclusion and future work  The paper at hand presents the results of a controlled experiment on the effect of using a semantic wiki for metadata management. Taking into consideration threats to validity, we have come to the conclusion that the semantically enhanced wiki engine SMW is supe- rior to the classical variant (i.e. a classical MediaWiki installation) regarding information retrieval tasks. At the same time, the results indicate that in the semantic wiki more effort is needed to build up the semantically  annotated knowledge base, which is a precondition for semantically enhanced functionality. These results are being discussed with reference to a real-world metada- ta management scenario in order to disclose how to draw conclusions for practice.

Further work needs to be done to assess whether the findings are representative for real-world scenarios.

The Design Research project mentioned is intended to observe comparable effects for the specific use case of a metadata repository with SAP support information.

Besides the effects investigated in our experiment, the effects of deep metadata integration into business processes have to be examined. The possibility to pro- vide a machine processable representation of collabo- ratively created wiki content that can be easily inte- grated into enterprise systems (i.e. a SAP system) is supposed to have a positive effect on process perfor- mance (i.e. process fidelity, process cycle time).
