Sieving Publishing Communities in DBLP

Abstract  DBLP is a bibliographic database with more than one  million data entries, collected from the last 70 years, and  labeled with diverse attributes like the authors? names, the  publication title, and the year of publishing. With this as  ground, the motivation of applying analytical examinations  to identifying publishing communities become meaningful.

In this respect and focusing on the idea of figuring out ex-  isting associative connectivity between authors, this work  exposes some novel information as for example the most fre-  quent community patterns, the ?Donald E. Ullman?-star of  1975, and an example for a typical extreme-sized commu-  nity. We close with a temporal flight throughout the decades  while observing the extreme-sized community and highlight  perspectives and further analytical suggestions.

1 Introduction  DBLP ([4], [5]) is a bibliographic database for scien-  tific publications in the area of Computer Science. It main-  tains publications of authors, having either published alone  or with other authors. DBLP is public and offers a re-  trieval interface to query bibliographic entries. Since March  2008, more than one million entries have been added to the  database, having the first publications from 1936. Further-  more, an intelligent DBLP core gathers data from known  conferences and collects electronic publications. Under-  standing DBLP as a bibliographic data store and publica-  tions as transactional data referring to authors, this gives  the ground for a further analytical examination, namely to  search for associative dependencies amongst them, to find  publishing communities, and to track these communities  over time.

In this regard, an applicable technique is association dis-  covery, which refers to the explorative, but stochastic de-  tection of associative rules A ? B, taking transactions as  input. The design and the implementation of association  discovery algorithms to find such associative rules in struc-  tured data sets has a long tradition. One of the first algo-  rithms, the apriori algorithm ([1]) has established that bases  on simple statistical calculations of frequent item sets com-  putation and association rules generation by counting item  frequencies and/or applying Bayesian probabilities. Many  others have followed, focusing both on static data and data  streams as well. Since that time, three parameters have  established: the support corresponds to the frequency, the  confidence to the Bayesian probability, and the Lift to the re-  lationship of existing confidence value to the statistically in-  dependent case. With that, we may observe how randomly  an association rule is: the more the Lift stands up from 1.0,  the more exceptional the item B is influenced by item A.

2 Selected Observations  In this respect, we have performed association analysis  of DBLP entries throughout on a yearly basis for the last 72  years. This is because the data set has a certain size and is  therefore more expressive than a data set on a monthly basis,  but more precise than a less fine-granulated discretisation.

The calculation of association rules is done by using a sam-  ple in a way that we firstly set the item set frequency thresh-  old to 0.1% and secondly the bayesian probability threshold  to 5%. Thirdly, since the number of received rules is still  tremendously high, we filter out some of them by taking the  Lift. In this respect, the number of scientific contributions is  downsized and we get a distribution curve having the pike  in 1972.

Although the publication of a scientific paper has a de-  lay of a several months (submission date, evaluation period,  publication), we count each scientific paper to the year it  has appeared. Following the yearly calculation of associa-  tive rules - beginning from 1936 and ending in 2007 - a var-  ious number of patterns occur. Additionally, we observe an  average authors per publication with a first tremendous in-  crease between 1952 and 1960, followed by a continuously  exponential increase until 2007. In the meanwhile, the aver-     age number of authors per publication has been established  to 2.5.

In concern of the absolute number of publications, W. V.

Quine leads the ranking of absolute numbers of publication  for almost 25 years, starting with an absolute percentage of  18.9% in 1938 over 10.62% in 1945 and 5.947% in 1957 to  1.307% in 1962. He is displaced by Henry C. Thacher who  leads the ranking until the early 1970?s. Generally, the Sup-  port values tremendously decrease as these values deeply  depend on the total number of transactions per year. On the  other side, the Lift values are distributed over an interval  of wide range, often being over 1000. For example, a Lift  of 1817.7 characterizes the association Itsuo Takanami ?  Katsuchi Inoue in 1975; a Lift of 6386.4 the association of  Paola Mello ? Evelina Lamma in 2005.

3 Example: The Donald E. Ullman-star of   The author?s role of the left side of an association rule  A ? B remembers to a trigger of the publication, whereas  the author on the right side takes the role of an reactor. In  the year of 1975, the roles of e.g. Jeffrey D. Ullman are typ-  ical and representative for many other authors, being both  a trigger and a reactor, defining a star-structure ([7]). A  strong dependency is shared, for example, with Alfred V.

Aho. However, Ullman is more triggered by Aho than vice  versa:  ? Alfred V. Aho ? Jeffrey D. Ullman - with a support of  0.1265%, a confidence of 60.00, and a lift of 129.33.

? Jeffrey D. Ullman ? Alfred V. Aho - with a support of  0.1265%, a confidence of 0.1265, and a lift of 129.33.

Interestingly, this cooperation occurs in 1995 again, but  with different parameter values. The Lift has been ex-  ploded to 875.5, Ullman?s triggering has increased by a fac-  tor nearly 200 to 25.8, and the frequency has become down-  sized to only a tenth:  ? Alfred V. Aho ? Jeffrey D. Ullman - with a support of  0.021%, a confidence of 72.10, and a lift of 875.5.

? Jeffrey D. Ullman ? Alfred V. Aho - with a support of  0.021%, a confidence of 25.8, and a lift of 875.5.

As we can observe in Figure 1, Ullman has published  with other co-authors as well in 1975. Here, the relation-  ships to some co-authors remain one-directed, since Jeffrey  D. Ullman is only triggered by Michael A. Harrison and  Stephen C. Johnson, but does not trigger them by himself.

All other relationships are bidirectional.

4 Publishing Communities  As presented in Figure 2, this view of the year of 1975  proves the existence of publishing communities, being ei-  ther more simple or more complex. In this respect, a sim-  ple community is clearly arranged, taking up a few authors  working together. For example, the solely publishing of au-  thor A and author B may lead to community where only A  and B belong to. The higher the number of nodes and/or  the higher the number of edges between them, the commu-  nity complexity increases. However, the most interesting  structures are certainly those where the participating mem-  bers are high but nevertheless understandable. As an exam-  ple, the ?Ullman-star? is convenient with this condition as  it nicely clarifies the Ullman?s publishing neighborhood.

With noise, we understand perseverative connections of  power 2, being represented as a bidirectional rule owning  two authors only. Noise is less interesting, being too small  and trivial. Generally, only those communities are focused  on that share a certain minimum activation. Moreover,  and as mentioned above, the confidence value reflects the  strengthen of an associative connection between authors;  and in this respect, reflexivity, namely publications of only  one author, is not taken into account. With this, the situation  visualized by Figure 2 mainly contains noisy communities;  except the communities left above makes some interest.

Figure 3 takes some further typical publishing commu-  nities, even occurring most frequent from 1950 until today.

Some of them seem to be related, for example a) and c), b)     Figure 2. Visualization of all publishing com- munities in 1975.

and h), or g) and i), respectively. Performing clustering with  appropriate attributes may contribute to a stronger classifi-  cation of community types, of course.

Figure 4 presents selected publishing communities of  1997, referencing to community k), n), and e) of Fig-  ure 3. As all authors, Donatella Sciuto is centered in  the first community pattern, but shares solely a direct  triggering/reacting-relationships with all. Vipin Kumar is  the core author for the community pattern right-outside.

5 Extreme-Sized Communities  An extreme-sized community is a publishing consortium  of high author density. Here, only a small number of authors  collaborate intensively with others, but most of the partic-  ipating authors share publications with only one author or  with two. A typical situation is shown in Figure 5 that rep-  resents an extreme-sized publication star. Whereas the core  of the star connects authors intensively, the outside is less  dense.

Figure 5. An extreme-sized star of high den- sity.

An extreme-sized star can be observed throughout the  decades, being visiting in the sense of a continual coming  and going. In Figure 6, we may observe that above all the  years between 1979 and 1992 adhere to the existence of an  extreme-sized star.

In general, an assumption is that extreme-sized stars cor-  respond to research topics that are trendy and modern. For  example, the field of Artificial Intelligence has become very  focused in the 1980?s. Interestingly, the extreme-sized star  has disappeared since 1992. One reason might be that the  agars of existing research directions has become very man-  ifold. Furthermore, the potential of electronic publishing     Figure 6.

has been simplified as never before, if necessary without  any external review.

However, what has happened in the years in between?

The answer is quite simply as the whole publications com-  munities grow up and change over time. They must be un-  derstood as an evolutionary step, with pace up and down.

As mentioned above, the establishment of research trends  is surely a motivation for big-stars, referring always on the  second place. The breakup of big-stars are more interest-  ing as this heralds the next research trend. As for example,  the years of 1978 and 1993 are such ones, surely referring  to Artificial Intelligence and the World-wide Web services  like the internet. The inconclusiveness after 1994 has fi-  nally ended in 2006.

Figure 7 shows publishing community dependencies of  Donald E. Knuth from the year of 1961 to 1990. We ob-  serve some stronger community activities with co-authors  in 1961, 1972, 1975, and 1977. As Knuth has published  many articles, books, and journal contributions himself  without any co-author, some publications are disregarded.

6 Conclusions  The vivid and colorful publication landscape enforces  the scientific community to a multitude of research activ-  ities, finally leading to publications. Additionally, since  the number of human researchers might is grown up, the  chances to electronically publish has been tremendously in-  creased. With this, a description of research landscapes and  especially the characterization of existing publishing com-  munities is promising. Firstly, current research trends can  be observed quite easily by following a big star (if exist-  ing) or the leading publications patterns or the search for  adjacent publication be improved (we better know whose  contributions we need to read).

A step ahead is a more detailed characterization of the  author?s roles over the years, the include of the research  topic itself by adjusting an ontology, and surely the con-  ferences they have published. The expressiveness of com-  munities could become enriched and leading actors be bet-  ter identified. Moreover, the visualization of connections  should regard the Confidence. Consequently, the connec-  tion becomes stronger the higher the Confidence is.

The benefit of such examination results, and especially a  temporal consideration of publishing communities, can be  observed, for example, in an additional feature towards ex-  plicit investigations, like an enhanced staffing politics.
