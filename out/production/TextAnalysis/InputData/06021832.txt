Abstract? This study aim to investigate the data mining task and techniques specifically sequential pattern mining on the outbreak detection in oil and gas pollution area. The sequential pattern mining can be treated as a classification problem if enough data for certain sequence of time is available, as association problem if large number of related attributes are available, or can be seen as the deviation detection problem if the available data contain only few rare pattern or outliers.  In this paper, the classification technique, decision tree is used for classification, and association rules mining is used for the outbreak detection task in oil and gas air dataset. The study found that unsupervised clustering using K-Means algorithm potentially obtain the rarely patterns of data distributing on several groups of pollutants and the average levels of supervised classification using the decision tree is a bit higher than the levels of association rules mining classification and appropriately used to classify the data by contaminants. Association rules mining on the other hand produce several sequences rules of contaminants.

This study has high potential in producing quality rules for outbreak detection.

Keywords? Outbreak detection, decision tree, association and sequential patterns

I. INTRODUCTION Outbreak or anomaly in the data is defined as a sequence of  pattern that occurs outside the baseline and also known as outlier in data mining. Outbreak detection is a predictive analytic relates with deviation detection or outliers analysis task in data mining. It involves analysis of time series surveillance data to find rules and patterns of events from the outbreak behavior, basically analysed using statistical method.

Outbreak detection task is very important especially in the area health surveillance, environment and disease. One of the interesting topics is the outbreak in pollution area since it has been the nation concern in maintaining the quality of life.

Outbreak in pollution area can cause serious diseases that if it can be detected earlier, many lives can be saved.

There are numbers of outbreak detection that available with various techniques being introduced ranging from statistic to data mining including machine learning. The outbreak detection is an essential for decision making process including dissemination of planning and scheduling through the identifying the potential of early outbreak.

Outbreak detection is one area that has relation with the deviation detection and classification task in data mining.

Initial study on outbreak detection showed that the type of outbreak data suit for outliers mining task in time series data mining as it contain time tag. Further study is required to realize the need of having effective techniques. There are many issues regarding the oil and gas such as oil and gas pollution, health effects, leasing, noise, and waste disposal.

However, the focus of the research will be on the oil and gas pollution and the health effects. In the oil and gas pollution problem outbreak can be defined by any anomaly behaviour or patterns of illness and environmental changes that occur within a timeline. The early detection of outbreak requires the availability of past experience via data that can contributes to the behaviour.  There are many causes of oil and gas pollution and it may be in short term or long terms. The massive release of these chemical substances can cause various minor and major illnesses and therefore degrades the quality of health in the particular area. This paper is organized as follows. Section II will discuss the related work and basic definition of outbreak. The methodology of the proposed approach is discussed in Section III. Section IV describes the experiment design and results and Section V concludes the work.



II. RELATED WORKS The outbreak detection techniques can be divided into three  approaches; the temporal, spatial and hybrid spatio-temporal approach [1-2]. The temporal data analisis is the commonly used approach for the anomaly detection in time series dataset.

It aims to identify the abnormalities patterns in data. This approach emphasized on searching for frequent and density within the event?s time interval. It looks for the changes using the linear or exponential equation [3]. A statistical approach used for analysis of temporal data is the Statistical Process Control with Control Statistical Cumulative Sums (CUSUM), Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) and Shewhart method.

The spatial data analysis involves searching for clusters of cases based on the geographical location to identify the location of anomaly in the data distribution in certain area.

This approach is the main criteria for the health monitoring [1- 2]. Several spatial analysis algorithms are the Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM), Spatial Scan Statistic and the  G3 - 3       Risk-Adjusted Support Vector Clustering (RSVC) algorithm.

The third approach is the spatio-temporal analysis is the combination of the spatial and the temporal data analysis. The approach has its advantage where it clusters the changes in the object that moves and identifies the abnormal movements in distribution of data [4]. H.Chen [1] introduced WSARE ?What?s Strange About Recent Events?, the rule based anomaly detection algorithm. The algorithm involves the heuristic search that analyses the combination of categorical data such as syndrom, age, gender, and geographical information to detect the anomaly of deviation. Another algorithm is PANDA, the Population-Wide Anomaly Detection and Assessment which involves searching for the probability of the disease distribution in the whole population.

Previous related works shown that the outbreak detection is related with the anomaly and deviation detection and time series data. Outbreak can also be defined as a frequent outliers [5]. Several researches also use classification techniques as the outbreak detection approach as large number of outbreak data is available. As in anomaly detection problem, the outbreak can be regarded as a classification problem if the abnormalities in the dataset are in large amount and can be easily clustered to the outbreak and non-outbreak class.

Several study that use classification techniques for this purpose can be seen in [6].

Bulkeridge, et.al. [7] suggest a practical classification for outbreak detection algorithms that considers the types of information encountered in surveillance analysis. They used classification techniques to solve the problem [8-9]. Shena & Cooper [10] propose the multivariate Bayesian that jointly modeling of known and unknown causes of events in the context of disease-outbreak detection. The Bayesian approach models and detects (1) known diseases (e.g., influenza and anthrax) by using informative prior probabilities and (2) unknown diseases (e.g., a new, highly contagious respiratory virus that has never been seen before) by using relatively non- informative prior probabilities.   In this paper we propose the classification approach for modeling the outbreak detection problem in oil and gas pollution area.



III. METHODOLOGY  A. Problem Definition There are many definition of outbreak problem discussed in  previous section. In this paper, the outbreak in oil and gas pollution is defined as a classification problem. Although the original pollution data does not include the temperature data, but in actual situation, if the weather is extreme with high temperature or too low that can increase the risk for the respiratory patient [11]. Therefore, the attribute TMP.AQI, CO8.AQI, OZ1.AQI, OZ8.AQI, PM251.AQI, SO21.AQI and NOX1.AQI are used to create the risk value and determine the value for outbreak class attribute. Table 1 show the content of pollution that exceeds the sensitive value that will cause the disease problem where the risk value is based on the cardiovascular risk and respiratory risk information obtained from the AQI value of the polluted material. The  cardiovascular and respiratory risks are dangerous to the health and can be the cause of various diseases such as heart disease, asthma, lung infection, and others. Several possible rules can be obtained with the following form:   IF event X, THEN Event Z occur ((X ? Z) with X = RISK (POLLUTANT (B)) Z = OUTBREAK (C)  RISK (POLLUTANT (B)) ? OUTBREAK (C)  Where  POLLUTANT = {(A1 = CO8.AQI),  (A2 = OZ1.AQI), (A3 = OZ8.AQI),  (A4 = PM251.AQI), (A5 = SO21.AQI),  (A6 = NOX1.AQI), (A7 = TMP.AQI)}), B  = { (0), (0.25), (1.0)}, RISK = ?B  and C = {(YES), (NO)}   TABLE 1  FONT SIZES FOR PAPERS THE POLLUTED AIR CONTENT AND THE POSSIBLE DISEASE EFFECTS  Disease Problem Content of Pollution (exceed Sensitive Values)  CO8 NOX1 OZ1 OZ8 PM251 SO21 Cardivascular ?    ? ? Respiratory  ? ? ? ? ?    B. Data Preparation Data used in the study are time series data of oil and gas air  pollution data range from 2001 until 2006 in Texas obtained from [11]. It involves five major contaminant component; Carbon Monoxide (CO), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Ozone (OZ), Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) and Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM2.5) at selected locations. Data are prepared based on the Air Quality Index (AQI) and health effect using standard preprocessing stage such as data cleaning, data integration (several years and locations), data transformation (nominal and discrete form), and data reduction. The level of pollution is obtained and the binning process is conducted to represent the continuos values of chemical level into specific category.

The dataset are merged based on the data collection center and date of collection. The original data collected contains very small amount of outbreak data. Therefore, in this study, we prepared the outbreak data using the following steps.

Step 1: Insertion of risk.level based on outbreak definition.

Step 2: Insertion of outbreak attribute.

Step 3: Original data contains 3% outbreak is maintained Step 4: Preparation of 40% of outbreak data.

Step 5: Selection of important attributes.

Table 2a-2b and Table 3 depict the polluted material  representation and the bin value prepared based on AQI value which are Good (G), Moderate (M), Unhealthy for Sensitive      people(S), Unhealthy (U), Very Unhealthy (V) and Hazardous (H). While the weather temperature was bin to Celcius temperature range which are Freeze (below then 0 degree), Cold (in between 0 to 15 degree), Warm (in between 15 to 30 degree) and Hot (more than 30 degree).

T6 [ 3.01  -  6.25 ) Death risk to everyone    Fig. 1 shows the graph example of outbreak detection using the risk level before convert the risk level to dicrete form.

From the record, there are ten outbreak points are detected for month of August 2004 where the solid line graph represent the outbreak curve. There are also six polluted chemicals and the weather temperature curve where it shows that the outbreak curve was influenced by the increasing trend of PM2.5, OZ and the weather temperature while other polluted chemical show no sign of increasing pattern.

Fig.1 Outbreak Detection  C. Model Development In this paper, we develop the classification model using two  classification techniques namely the decision tree (J48) and Apriori Algorithm for association rules mining (CBA).

Sequential pattern mining is very challenging task as there is a need to identify the sequential patterns that occurs that maybe giving important indication or signal. We use the sequential pattern mining approach adopting the apriori algorithm. Then, the rules will be generated and analyzed to obtain the specific sequences. We emphasized on three main problem; classification problem if enough data is available for certain time sequence, association problem if large amount of attributes available or the deviation detection problem if only a few deviation pattern available.

D. Evaluation Method In outbreak detection, the most important is to evaluate the  algorithm detection performance in term of algorithm detection rate (specificity), relevence warning rate (sensitivity), false alarm rate and accuracy of detection. Fig. 2 represent measurement matriks adapt from Mukhi [13] define the;  ? sensitivity as A/(A+C), ? specificity as A/(A+B) while, ? false alarm rate as B/(B+D) and, ? accuracy of outbreak as (A+D)/(TOTAL)         Classified as Real Event  Outbreak Normal  Outbreak True Positive (A) False Positive  (B) A+B  Normal False Negative (C) True  Negative (D) C+D  A+C B+D A+B+C+D  Fig.  2 Measurement Matriks

IV. EXPERIMENTS The polluted material dataset used in the experiment  obtained from Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) available in [12]. Two set data are prepared: i) original data that contain 3% of outbreak data, ii) a modified dataset for classification contains 40% outbreak data.  Then original dataset contain 5% and 10% outbreak are prepared by reducing the size while fourtheen different modified dataset are prepared based on the different sampling method. Four sample based on stratification (S1-S4) will be used as training datasets, while sample by four different locations (A1-A4) and sample by six different years (Y1-Y6) will be used as supplied test sets. For each training dataset, 10 test datasets were use for experiments. Table 5a below shows the detection modelling setup while table 5b shows the classification modelling setup. Experiment on classification modelling will be carried out first to collect the sequence rules for the detection modelling.

Experiment I (Decision Tree Model) The classification modeling using the J48 decision tree is  carried out using the experimental setup described previously.

Table 6a presents the accuracy percentage (Accuracy), number of leaves (Leaves), the size of tree (Tree Size), ratio no outbreak point (TN/FP), ratio outbreak point (TP/FN), rate of no outbreak point(TN Rate) and rate of outbreak point (TP) for training set. The experimental result shows that set ST1 with 53 leaves for tree size 65 manage to achieve higher result for TN and TP rate rather that ST2, ST3 and ST4.

Every training set were tested using ten supplied test set and the experimental result in Table 6b shows that J48 manages to achieve high accuracy from 98% for every supplied datasets.

Fig. 3 shows the false alarm rate for the experiment. The graph shows that overall the false alarm rate is low which is below than 0.025 and experiment using ST1 as training dataset is the lowest false alarm rate among the rest.

Experiment II (Association Rules Classification Model) The CBA algorithm is used for the association rules mining task to generate meaningful associations in the dataset. Table 7 shows parameter comparison experimental result using ST1 dataset to choose the suitable value for minimum confidence and minimum support using apriori algorithm as classifier.

TABLE 7 PARAMETER COMPARISON RESULTS FOR CBA  Minimum Confidence  Minimum Support 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4  0.9 89.76 69.85 50.02 50.02 0.7 74.28 75.396 78.90 50.02 0.4 72.70 66.79 66.79 66.79 0.1 72.70 66.79 66.79 66.79    Four different minimum support value which are 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 with four different minimum confidence value which are 0.1, 0.4, 0.7 and 0.9 are used. The accuracy of the classification are compared and only experiment with confidence 0.9 and support 0.1 manage to achieve higher accuracy with result 89.76% and success in classify outbreak point. The rest only success in classify no outbreak point and failed in classify the outbreak point cause the accuracy result in between 50% to 72%.

Table 8a shows the number of association and classification rules produce by apriori algorithm with 0.1 minimum support and 0.9 minimum confidence value for each training set.

The classification rules used by ST4  is 38 rules also is the highest among the other set which is less than 25 rules.

Table 8b shows the percentage of classification accuracy, normal and outbreak point and the detection rate. The outbreak rate is lower than the no outbreak rate for all of the experiment where almost 400 point was misclassify as no outbreak point.

From the graphs, it shows that experiment using ST4 training set is the lowest false alarm rate meanwhile ST1 is the highest rates.

Experiment III (k-Means Detection Model) K-Means clustering for detection modelling is used to  cluster the data and can also be used as deviation detection.

The original dataset with difference size and difference outbreak percentage is used as the test set. The initialling center used is the hierarchical clustering on sampling from entire dataset with maximum with k cluster is 2. Two experiements were carried out and table 10a shows the result of clustering for each center while table 10b shows the accuracy of detection.

TABLE 10A: RESULT OF CLUSTERING  Data Center Size(%) Size(N) Sum Squares Sum  Squares/Size AS1 1 37.45 906 3024.55 3.34  2 62.55 1513 5404.69 3.57 AS2 1 90.29 2184 7707.10 3.53  2 9.71 235 888.22 3.78  TABLE 10B ACCURACY FOR DETECTION  Data TN/FP TP/FN TN Rate TP  Rate Accuracy  (%) AS1 2304(862/1142) 115(71/44) 0.374 0.617 49.6 AS2 2183(2183/0) 236(235/1) 1 0.995 99.8   From the result, the accuracy of AS1 clustering detection is low in detection normal and outbreak point but almost  accurate for AS2. The clustering detection manages to detect outbreak point for dataset with 10% outbreak with only one point of outbreak missed.

CONCLUSIONS Classification modeling carried out using decision tree J48  and association rules mining classification CBA shows high accuracy in detecting the outbreak while the clustering using k-Means shows low accuracy for less than 10% outbreak point.

Association rules mining on the other hand produce several strong sequences rules of contaminants but the further correlation measures should be used to produce meaningful correlation rules. This study has high potential in producing quality rules for outbreak detection.
