Research of Mining Effective and Weighted Association Rules Based on   Dual Confidence

Abstract?Association rule is an important model in data mining. However, traditional association rules are mostly based on the support and confidence metrics, and most algorithms and researches assumed that each attribute in the database is equal. In fact, because the user preference to the item is different, the mining rules using the existing algorithms are not always appropriate to users. By introducing the concept of weighted dual confidence, a new algorithm which can mine effective weighted rules is proposed in this paper, which is on the basis of the dual confidence association rules used in algorithm. The case studies show that the algorithm can reduce the large number of meaningless association rules and mine interesting negative association rules in real life.

I.  INTRODUCTION The association rule mining is one of the most important  branch of data mining , which focuses on studying the interesting association relation and correlation relation of the item sets in large amounts data. Agrawal first proposed the problem about  association rule of  item sets mining in the database of customer transactions in 1993, and proposed classic Apriori algorithm in 1994. Although many researchers later did wider and more profound research on it, they are mainly focused on the research to improve the performance of the association rule mining algorithms, and they implied to assume that the distribution of each item in database is uniform and  no difference [1-3] in their studies, they ignored the difference of importance of each item and the nouniformity of distribution in the real database.

Therefore, with the disagreement of assumptions in the existing algorithm with practical circumstances, we use the weighted idea to present the weighted mining algorithm of dual confidence based on the different preference of people for each item in the database in the paper. This algorithm not only may reflect the importance of the item but also can enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the algorithm.



II. ASSOCIATION RULE MINING ALGORITHM OF DUAL CONFIDENCE According to the value of correlation measure, association rules are classified into positive and negative association rules. The association rule mining algorithm of dual confidence (DPNAR) is an algorithm to solve a great number of redundant and wrong association rules that the  traditional support-confidence framework may produce. Its idea is substitute ?the support- confidence?correlation? framework of the traditional mining algorithms for ?support-dual confidence ? correlation? framework mining algorithms.

A. Steps of the algorithm Step1  Produce frequent item set L.

It is a set of items whose support are greater than or equal to user-specified minimum support threshold.

Step2 Generate association rules using L in the step1.

If frequent item set A L?  contains two frequent  item ,X Y , and YXA ?= , ?=? YX , then it can generate association rule YX ? .

Step3  Using the correlation between X and Y ( ) ( ) ( )BABAcorr YX supsupsup, ??=  to discriminate that the association rule generated in Step 2 is the positive correlation or negative correlation, and form association rules our interesting.

If , 0X Ycorr >  and confPYXconf min)( ??? , then association rule generated is positive; otherwise, if , 0X Ycorr < and confNYXconf min)( ???? , then association rule generated is negative. Where  confP min?  is a minimum confidence to set for positive association rule, confN min?  is a minimum confidence to set for negative association rule, and  confP min? + confN min? = 1 [1]  B. Evaluation of the algorithm 1)  Advantage  The algorithm can reduce to produce a large number of useless and wrong association rules, mine a large number of significant negative association rules and overcome the shortcomings of low efficiency and not enough accuracy of the traditional algorithm.

2)  Disadvantage The algorithm implicitly assumes that each item in the  database has the same importance and effect, but the actual situation is not so.

III. RELATED CONCEPT ABOUT  WEIGHTED DUAL CONFIDENCE  In order to improve the association rule mining algorithm of dual confidence, this paper introduces the concept of weighted dual confidence and proposes a new mining algorithm of database.

Let }{ miiiI ,,, 21 ?=  be a set of items. Let kw  be weighted value of ki th item ( 1,2, , )k m= ? . Let D , the task-relevant data, be a set of transactions, where each transaction T  is a set of items satisfying T I? . sup( )X indicates that D contains the percentage of the item X .

D DTTXTX ??= ,:)sup(   A. Confidence  For the association rule :R YX ? , where IYIX ?? , and ?=? YX , Confidence of  the rule  R defined as sup( )( ) ( )  sup( ) X YConf X Y p Y X  X ?  ? = = ,  it describes the reliability of the rule.

B. Weighted Support and Confidence 1)  Weighted Support  The weighted value of the subset ( )X X I?  of items in transaction it is calculated as  [ ]( ) [ ][ ]  [ ]( ) [ ][ ]?  ?  = ??  = ??  = X  k kiXi  X  k kiXi  wit  wit Xw  k  k   1)(   where [ [ ]]i kt i w is the weighted value of the kth  item ki in the ith transaction.

The weighted support is a summary of weighted value of the transaction item set containing this item in the transaction database, that is  ( ) [ ]( ) [ ]  [ ]( ) [ ] ( )1   sup k  k  X  X i ki X k X  X  i ki X k  N t i w Nw X w X nn t i w  ? ? =  ? ? =  ? ?? ? ? = =  ? ?? ? ?   Where XN  is the count of X in the database , n  is the total number of database records.

2)  Weighted Confidence The weighted confidence is the weighted support ratio of  the weighted support of X Y?  and X  in the transaction database :  ( ) ( )( ) sup  sup w X Y  wconf X Y w X  ? ? =  [ ]( ) [ ]  [ ]( ) [ ]  [ ]( ) [ ]  [ ]( ) [ ] 1 1   k k  kk  X Y X  i k i ki X Y i X k kX Y  X X Y X  i ki k i X Yi X kk  t i w t i w N N  t i wt i w  ?  ? ? ? ? ? = =?  ?  ? ? ?? ? ==  ? ? ? ?? ? ? ? = ?  ? ?? ? ? ?? ?  ? ?  ?? Where X YN ?  is the count of X Y? in the database.

3)   Weighted Dual Confidence Two confidences in mining algorithm of dual  confidence satisfy the relation: 1)()( =??+? YXconfYXconf .

Using the same idea, after weighting the item, this paper introdues )( YXwconf ?  and )( YXwconf ?? , where )( YXwconf ? denotes weighted confidence of YX ?  ; )( YXwconf ??  denotes weighted confidence of YX ?? .

They have the following property[5]: Theorem: 1)()( =??+? YXwconfYXwconf

IV. WEIGHTED  ASSOCIATION  RULE MINING ALGORITHM OF DUAL CONFIDENCE  A. The Idea of Algorithm The basic idea of weighted association rule mining  algorithm of dual confidence (WDPNAR) is to weight each item to mine the database base on the mining algorithm of ?support-dual confidence-correlation? framework.

B. Steps of The Algorithm Improving weighted association rule mining algorithm  of dual confidence is basically similar to the association rule mining algorithm of dual confidence. Its algorithm steps  are as following: Step1  Produce frequent item set L.

It is a set of items whose weighted support is not less than the user-specified minimum weighted support threshold.

Step2 Generate association rules using L in the step1.

If frequent item set A L?  contains two frequent  item ,X Y , and YXA ?= , ?=? YX , then it can generate association rule YX ? .

Step3  Using the weighted correlation between X and Y ( ) ( ) ( )YwXwYXwwcorr YX supsupsup, ??=  to discriminate that the association rule generated in Step 2 is the positive correlation or negative correlation, and form association rules our interesting.

If , 0X Ywcorr >  and confPYXwconf min)( ??? , then association rule generated is positive; otherwise, if , 0X Ywcorr < and confNYXwconf min)( ???? , then association rule generated is negative.
