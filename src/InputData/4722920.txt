Research on data mining in college education

Abstract   Social demand information is very important for  college education development, and also be the important guidance of college education. How to obtain all kinds of information and further find its potential link are the college information systems major issues resolved. This paper applies data mining technique to college education, process the College data collected by SPSS crosstab and correlation analysis, then find the immanent rule of people need so that can supply the college with the better support decision.

Introduction  Social demand is an important guidance of college  education development, if colleges want to improve their competitiveness, in addition to colleges should pay attention to the technical and management levels, there should be more focus on the present and future social demand. Collect the information, many colleges now has realized the needs of the social feedback information systems management by the web technology, but many colleges did not realize the intrinsic link between the information tap, else can bring greater support for colleges decision-making.

Data mining, also known as knowledge discovery in the database, refers to extract implicit potential useful information and knowledge from a large quantity of incomplete, noise, and blurring, random data which people do not know in advance [1]. Data mining method can usually be divided into two categories: The first category is statistical, and its? technology used probability analysis, relevance, cluster analysis and discriminated analysis; the other is machine learning in the artificial intelligence-based, through training and learning a large number of samples that need to set the mode or parameters.

2. Issues raised   As a way to provide decision information, one of the characteristics of the college information service system is guided by social demand. The services provided by the college is not to allow the society to adapt, but information services system should be the maximum from the needs of the society, design the services system based on "the interests of the society as the center ", and improve the service efficiency, reduce the service cost, improve service quality, provide the social with the largest service efficiency. Therefore, the college information service system is not just to changes the mode of service, but more important is to heighten information services consciousness and innovate the concept of service. To achieve this goal, information departments and the society must be interactive, study the real need of society.  At present this study has follows perspective [2]:  a. Establish social opinion collection mechanism.

First establishes the network system of collection social opinion. Uses the computer technology fully, enables the different opinion of each aspect to reflect to the college departments prompt and accurately.

Secondly, each main body of college should establish information system, allocate specialized personnel to work professionally, so different views from the social can be reflected in different categories for policy- makers with timely and accurate decision-making signal. Final collection social views should be finalized as a management system.

b. Uses the information architecture (IA) way to carry on the investigation and analysis.

Architecture of information act is to organize information and design information environment, information space and information architecture to meet the information needs of social education. The current method has been successfully applied to various construction sites, as a blueprint for the building site, whether the site solution with the organization's business objectives, whether to meet the information   DOI 10.1109/CSSE.2008.638    DOI 10.1109/CSSE.2008.638     needs of users, and other practical issues, such as in a series of indicators weighted analysis IA Information websites can be drawn after the social satisfaction rankings.

c. Data warehouse and data mining technology. For example, on the basis of analysis and study of the association rules and decision tree two commonly used data mining technology, apply the Apriori Algorithm of association rules and Decision Tree ID3 algorithm to college data analysis, establish an college data analysis system based on data mining.

3. Data mining research technique  3.1 Multi-dimensional cross-table analysis   Multi-dimensional cross-table analysis showed that two or more variables joint frequency distribution table. It belongs to the scope of discrete multivariate analysis, cross-generation multi-dimensional or two- dimensional form, mainly used for the analysis of each thing and phenomenon?s differences identify the inspection variables whether have relation. For example, to understand the different age levels and occupation are concerned about the relationship between the content of the Information, the process can be used to form a two-dimensional tables. To show that different age groups, all education levels are concerned about the number of different frequency content distribution, correlation, and to choose suitable way to carry out inspection. Multi-dimensional cross-table analysis of the selected output variables can choose between the correlation coefficient table below on the related analysis and correlation coefficients brief.

3.2 Correlation analysis method   Between the objective things are interrelated and mutual influence and mutual restraint. Reflect the interconnected between things to a quantity, that is correlation between variables. For instance height and body weight, income and expense. The correlation analysis will find the latent rule, which is valuable, and description variable relates mutually from the data.

Through several descriptions correlational dependence statistics may determine between the variable?s connection close degree and linear correlation direction. Most commonly use is Pearson correlation coefficient, usually indicated with R.

If variables X and y carries on the observation, obtains a group of data: xi, yi (i=l, 2, ?, n), X and between Y the correlation coefficient formula is  2 2  ( )( )  ( ) ( )  i i  i i  xy x x y y  x x y y R ? ?  ? ? ? = ?  ? ? x, y respectively is the xi, yi (i=1,2,?, n)  Arithmetic average value.

Where | Rxy | ? 1.0 <Rxy <1, x and y that is right  relevant; if -1 <Rxy <0, that negative correlation between X and Y; and | Rxy | closer to the 1, between the variables X and Y variables linear relationship is more remarkable. If Rxy closer to the 0, X and Y does not claimed related. When |Rxy | = 1, say X and Y completely related.

4. Example of data mining technology in college education   A College information management system based on web improves college education competitiveness and transparency greatly, also accumulated massive data, but it is far from decision-making, and forecast, has not displayed effectiveness fully which its should have. For example each information website has similar nearly ?social opinion investigation? column, it is a very good way of understanding the social?s demand of college education, but looked from the website announcement investigation result, the conclusion also pauses in calculation the total to the single question, and the proportion and so on in the simple isolation analysis. Take one college information website investigation as an example, investigates this college some attentions which social be concerned (being possible to elect), and mainly understands the populace demand and surveyor's basic document (including age level, occupation and so on)  The website has made the simple statistics to the questionnaire, for example the voting result of the age level, the occupation level and likes tour site shown in Table 1.

Table 1 college net investigation  No Problem Name Number          School fame  School fee  Teach quality  Employment rate  School building  School situation  School management  Student skill           It is not difficult to see that above analysis methods  still remain in the surface of the problem, it did not reveal the intrinsic link of all factors. For example, we can?t get the conclusions of the relationship between a     certain age levels and corresponding choice, or whether different occupation levels will affect their choice. Therefore, we study the information collected in-depth with the method of data mining, in a certain age conditions, analysis different occupation and concerned problem intrinsic link by multi-dimensional cross-table, specific steps are as follows:  Analysis the data, define variables. For multiple- choice questions, define a variable for each topic.

Variables defined in table 2.

Figure 1 Correlation Coefficient table   C. Conclusions analysis.

From the cross-table, we can see clearly the  distribution among different age groups, occupation and concerned problem. For example in the 30 to 50- year-old age group, a total of six individuals, including employing unit group has 2 person be interested in school fame, 4 person be interested in student skill. In a word, 30 to 50-year-old age group are greater interest in school fame and student skill, the result fits on employing unit interest. Over the age of 50 are interested mainly concentrated in school fame and school fee, reflect the adults to be pragmatic.

May see from the correlation coefficient table, in the 30 to 50-year-old age group, the correlation degree between the occupation and corresponding concerned     problem is high, the Pearson correlation coefficient is 0.716.The analysis result indicates that it has not obvious relevance between occupation and its choice, in other words, in identical age level, regardless of occupation, their matter of concern is almost the same.

Moreover data mining has the strict with the data preparation, previous data preparation work is very important regarding the data mining success or failure, so request have to pay attention to the collection target comprehensive in collection data time, have to use certain method to cover the flaw data, This paper introduces the application technical mentality of data mining technology in the college social electronic information affairs, and obtains an analysis result from small sample data, does not represent the actual situation, may expand the sample capacity in the practical application , then obtains a more accurate conclusion.

5. Conclusions  At present, the application of data mining in the college social services is relatively small, this paper through data mining in one college social information  services application, the question of independence be linked together, demonstrate the nature and potential link of the problem, provide better decision-making information and support to the Information for the actual work, we can understand the actual needs of the social by these knowledge, enhance the accuracy and scientific decision-making of departments, better service to the people.
