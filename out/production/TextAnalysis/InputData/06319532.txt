Inter-transaction Association Rule Mining in  the Indonesia Stock Exchange Market

Abstract?Stock exchanges have a major impact on Indonesia economy condition as well as on the global economy. Stock activities forecasting is still a challenging issue which is a high demand for stock actors. Therefore, there is still a need to develop an application that is capable to accurately predict directions of stock price movement. This research proposes a data mining technique to model relationship between company stocks with other company stocks listed in the Indonesia Stock Exchange in a form of association rules. It is expected that extracted rules can be of a help to predict future stock prices movements with significant level of accuracy.

I. INTRODUCTION Association rule mining is the process of discovering  knowledge about relationship between items or events [1,2,3], which ideally can be applied to estimate upcoming states of a dynamic system, e.g. movement of stock prices in a stock exchange market. The word ?movement? in this study means the direction of a stock price, i.e. up, down, or stable (unchanged). An example of a rule that can be generated from traditional association rule mining is given below:  ? R1: When the prices of IBM and SUN go up, at 80 percent of probability the price of Microsoft goes up on the same day.

In the given example extracted rule might be of help for investors to discover relationship between movements of company stock prices, however its role in stock price prediction is limited [1]. Conversely, market participants, in particular treders, demanded a more detail form of expression or rule as follows:  ? R2: When the prices of IBM and SUN go up, Microsoft?s will most likely (80 percent of probability) go up the next day.

With such kind of a rule, it would be possible for investors or stock traders to predict the stock price movements on the next day.

The process of extracting such rules from a set of transaction or inter-transaction data set is known as the association rule-mining process [2]. One basic technique used in the association rule-mining algorithm is the apriori algorithm [2]. The principle of apriori algorithm is to reduce the number of candidates with pruning techniques, reduce the number of comparisons, so it is not needed to match every candidate against every transaction and anti-monotone [4,5].

The main purpose of this study is to forecast and analyze company stock price movements in the Indonesia Stock Exchange market (IDX) by implementing the association rule-mining algorithm to extract rules of relationship between movements of company stock prices from time to time.

In addition, the study also examines and evaluates several factors that affect the number of rules generated. Throughout conducted experiment, it is expected to have more number of rules generated as by being able to accomplish such task more conditions between movements of company stock proces can be modelled better.



II. IMPLEMENTATION OF PROPOSED TECHNIQUE As explained in the previous section, stock price  prediction in this research is performed by implementing a data mining approach named the association rule-mining algorithm. The association rule-mining algorithm is a data mining technique that has been widely used to find the relationship between items from a number of transactions record. The rule is utilized as patterns that can be used to predict the occurrence of an attribute.

However, association rule-mining algorithm has a lack of predicting general pattern of inter-transaction records especially when being used to analyze real-time data such as movement of company stock prices in a stock exchange market.

Therefore, this paper uses the concept of inter-transaction rule mining to accomplish such task. This data mining technique in this study is then divided into 3 steps as follows:  ? The first step is the data collection process: raw data of company stock prices in the IDX is collected from Yahoo Finance.

The second step is the data preprocessing phase. This step is conducted to process the raw data where it involves the conversion of raw price market data to become association rule friendly data set. In the data preprocessing step a sliding windows w is used.

? The last step is the rule generation of frequent item set from the constructed association rule friendly data set.

A. Data Collection The data is obtained in a tabular form with DATE,  OPEN, HIGH, LOW, CLOSE, VOLUME and ADJUST CLOSE as an attribute. DATE identifies the day of the transaction, OPEN means the starting price, HIGH have the meaning of the highest price that occurred on this day, LOW is the vice versa of HIGH, CLOSE identifies the closing price, VOLUME is the total number of transactions on a particular date and ADJUST CLOSE is the excess of the stock data of acceptable calculated by the IDX.

The data set used in conducted experiments ranges from 1st January 2011 to 30th June 2012.

B. Data Preprocessing As it was outlined in previous section, the main purpose  of the data-preprocessing step is to convert the raw stock data obtained from Yahoo Finance into association rule friendly data set so the item sets produced can be mined with association rule mining algorithm.

Figure 2. Illustration of HMSP stock data encoding process.

Figure 3. Illustration of sliding window process to generate extended data set from raw data set.

Association rules friendly item set is a combination of the number of the company and its respective position where numbers represents the company name. The transaction T with the number of companies up to N companies, the attribute is x and time-stamp is equal extended transaction with sliding windows w ? 3, define as follows:  T = {0x0 0x1 0x2 0x3 1x0 1x1 1x2 1x3 ? Nxw}  (1)  In this study we used the CLOSE stock price value as the reference of a company stock price and waived the other information of stock price i.e., OPEN, HIGH, LOW, and ADJUST CLOSE.

To determine the movement of a company stock price we decimate the CLOSE value of current date by the CLOSE value of yesterday.

Consequently, there are three different position of particular company stock which are: (1) up, (2) down and (3) equal, the meaning of each word is indicating whether the stock price of the stock on that day is increasing, decreasing, or stationary in comparison to the previous day.

A sliding window w = 0 means the transaction which will happen tomorrow, w = 1 means the transaction carried out today, w = 2 is transaction conducted on yesterday, and w = 3 means transaction made on day before yesterday.

Number of companies N = 0 represents the first company, N = 1 represents the second company, and so forth. This sliding window process on data preprocessing is described in Fig. 3. In this research, two companies limit the number company used to extract the association rules in conducted experiments.

ASSOCIATION RULE MINING FRIENDLY DATA SET DERIVED FROM EXTENDED DATA SET IN TABLE III  0Equal0  1Equal0  0Equal1  1Down1  0Equal2 1Up2 0Equal0  1Down0  0Equal1  1Up1  0Up2  1Down2  The total number of attributes Tx increase according to the value of w used and the number of the current attribute x as stated below:  Tx = x ? w (2)  The extended data set produced using data set and sliding window w = 3 resulting an extended data set as listed in Table III. The result of extended data set should be eliminated as in this study only three item-sets are being considered to be used to extract the association rules between movements of company stock prices.

By looking at the time-stamp we can determine how many item-sets in sliding position such as {0Equal0 1Equal0} is calculated one because although different company but it has the same time-stamp. The first and second sliding window has three item-sets, however the third and fourth sliding windows have only two and one item-sets.

So, sliding window positions third and fourth should be eliminated and become frequent item set resulting a new data set as listed in Table IV.

Additionally, after the data set reduction process the minsup used to form the rules in this study is set to 6% whilst minconf, which is the confidence level of extracted rules, is set to 50%.

C. Generating the Rules As the generated association rules need to maintain the  sequence order item-sets, the rule generation method applied in this study is a modified version of the original rule generation method commonly used in other association rule mining algorithms.



III. EXPERIMENTAL STUDY In the conducted experiment 5 different categories of  stock pair, as described below, were used to test the accuracy of proposed application:  ? The first category is ?same company and different sector (related)?, example the same company run in the cigarette industry and agriculture industry.

? The second category is ?different company and same sector (related)?, example both company run on the cigarette industry.

? The third category is ?different company and different sector (related)?, example a company A run  on the cigarette industry and company B run on the agriculture industry.

IV. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK Results of conducted experiments indicate that predictive  patterns generated using the proposed method can help to predict stock price movements on the next day, especially for 3rd and 4th categories with considerably good accuracy.

However, it was also found that these rules can only be applied when the left side have a pattern occur. Therefore, it is still become a challenge to be able to apply all extracted rules at any given time to predict the upcoming stock price with high accuracy.

Additionally, there are several works that can be applied as a continuation to this research. First is to handle the significant increase in the number of attributes. Another possible direction is to evaluate and analyze all the different type of rules generated and discovers which rules are the most significant ones. The rules generated from the time range can also show various kinds of information such as the current trend of a stock. The last one is to explore the possibility of applying the FITI-Algorithm to predict the stock price movements in the Indonesia Stock Exchange market.
