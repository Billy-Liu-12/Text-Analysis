Effective and Stable Feature Selection Method Based on Filter for Gene Signature  Identification in Paired Microarray Data

Abstract?A huge amount of microarray datasets are produced with big number of genes and small samples. Feature selection methods have become a very sharp tool to select the gene signatures from the whole gene set. In recent years, researchers are concerned much about the datasets containing samples of cancer as well as corresponding control tissues.

However, few feature selection methods consider the effect of paired samples. In this article, we propose a new feature selection method for paired microarray datasets based on the original paired t-test approach. We apply on the paired datasets across six common cancer types. Through comparison with some widely used methods on the performance of prediction power, stability of gene lists and functional stability, our method shows excellent performance. The proposed method has good effectiveness, stability and consistency, which enables the method to be applicative to feature selection for paired microarray expression data analysis.

I.  INTRODUCTION Now, a large number of microarray related data have  been obtained such as the datasets in GEO. However, most of them have small number of samples and tens of thousands of genes. The high dimensionality will hinder extracting useful information effectively and robustly. Feature selection technique can be used to select a subset of relevant features by eliminating redundant, irrelevant and noisy features.

However, complex wrapper and embedded methods have higher computational complexity than filter methods, and they generally do not outperform simple filter methods [1].

Over the past decade, lots of filter methods have been developed. In 1999, Golub et al. [2] presented a filter method for cancer classification based on correlation coefficient ranking. Callow et al. [3] applied a two-sample t-statistic filter method to remove irrelevant genes and identify significant genes with altered expression. Huber et al. [4] used a two-sample permutation t-test to detect differential expression genes and remove irrelevant genes of the dataset.

Deng et al. [5] proposed a rank sum test method for informative gene discovery. Ding et al. [6] proposed a minimum redundancy-maximum relevance (MRMR) filter feature selection framework. But there are few feature selection methods which considered the impact of paired samples. So, in this paper, the proposed method mainly  focuses on the gene signature identification from the paired microarray data.

Firstly, an improved paired t-test method based on original method [7] is used to calculate the statistical significant between samples and genes. In the second step, we calculate the q-value of False Discovery Rate for each gene in terms of the p-value obtained from the improved paired t-test. Finally, Pearson correlation coefficient is used to decrease the redundant genes in the gene list and the final gene ranking is generated by optimizing the q-value and the redundancy score. We evaluate the method on effectiveness and stability by using microarray datasets of six types of cancers. When evaluated on different datasets of the same cancer, the mean accuracies of the method by SVM classifier on these datasets for top 100 genes are 81.85%, 93.92%, 94.27%, 60.63%, 98.65% and 68.89%, respectively. Then, we also evaluate the stability of gene ranking lists and the functional stability. The results of the proposed method are more stable than the other existing methods.



II. METHODS  A. Data Sources Six types of cancer gene expression datasets from GEO  are used in this paper to measure the performance of feature selection methods. In order to obtain the samples of tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues, we select the subset of each dataset. 43 paired samples of breast cancer from GSE15852 are used as training dataset for breast cancer and 57 paired samples from four datasets are used as test datasets. The datasets information of lung, colon, gastric, liver and pancreatic cancers are also summarized in Table I.

B. Improved Paired t-test by Fold Change For the paired microarray datasets, we have the gene  expression values of n pairs with sample number j (j = 1, 2, ?, n). Although the expression values of most datasets are usually preprocessed by log scale, in this article, we only use the original expression data which have not been normalized by logarithm. In original statistic method of paired t-test, for each gene i (i = 1, 2, ..., m) in gene expression data, the differential expression value of sample pair j is obtained using the subtraction in gene expression data between cancer sample j and normal sample j [7]. The formula is shown as follows:  ij ij ijd C N= ?                                      (1)        TABLE I.  GENE EXPRESSION DATASETS OF SIX CANCER TYPES  Cancer Type  Training Datasets Test Datasets  Breast GSE15852(43) GSE10810(26), GSE16873(12) GSE5764(10),   GSE14548(9)  Lung GSE19804(60) GSE22058(95), GSE10072(33) GSE7670(27),   GSE2514(19) GSE5364*(12)  Colon GSE8671(32) GSE25070(26), GSE21510(23) GSE23878(18), GSE18105(17) GSE5364(9)  Gastric GSE13911(31) GSE13195(50), GSE5081(16) GSE19826(12)  Liver GSE22058(96) GSE14520(19), GSE12941(10) GSE5364*(8)  Pancreatic GSE15471(39) GSE28735(45), GSE16515(16) GSE22780(8) *Subsets of the dataset are selected as different cancer datasets  where ijC  and ijN  (i = 1, ..., m and j = 1, ?, n) are the expression values of gene i in cancer and normal samples of patient j, respectively. Then the paired t-test can be calculated using the following formulas:   =1  ( ) ( 1)  n i ijj  n ii ijj  i i  i  d d n  s d d n  d t  s  = =  = ? ?  =  (2)  However, since different datasets have different experimental environment and conditions, the subtracting method does not have good stability and generalization ability across different datasets. Therefore, we improve the computing process of distance ijd  using fold change. The specific formula is as follows:  1 ( 1) 11 ( 1)  ij ij  ij ij  ij  FC FC d FC  FC  ? >= = ? <  where ij ij ijFC C N=         (3)  The ijd  value in (3) is used as the improved paired t-test value by fold change.

C. Statistical Significance Here we use the approach proposed by Storey and  Tibshirani in 2003 to measure statistical significance of each gene. The method measures statistical significance by q- value based on the concept of the False Discovery Rate (FDR) and offers a sensible balance between the number of true and false positives. In this article, we calculate the q- value for each gene in terms of the p-value obtained from the improved paired t-test.

D. Decreasing Redundant Genes In this article, the redundancy of a gene subset is  determined by the Pearson correlation coefficient among the genes. The formula of Pearson correlation coefficient is defined as follows:  2 2 2 2 ( , )  ( ) ( ) j j j j  j j j j  n x y x y P x y  n x x n y y  ? =  ? ? (4)  where x and y are two vectors of expression values on two genes, and n is the number of samples. Then, the redundancy of a gene i with other genes in the subset S is defined as:  , ,  1 1( , )* ( , ) 1 1i N Cj S i j j S i j  CorrValue P i j P i j N N? ? ? ?  = ? ?  (5)  where ( , )NP i j  and ( , )CP i j  are the Pearson correlation coefficients between gene i and gene j in normal and cancer samples. N is the number of genes in subset S.

In our method, the final gene ranking is generated by optimizing the ratio of the logarithm of q-value?s reciprocal of a gene and the redundancy of the gene in the set. The optimizing process is similar as mRMR and the formula is shown as follows:  1log( ) arg max ii i S  i  qValue index  CorrValue? =                         (6)

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION In this paper, the evaluation process is performed using  our proposed feature selection method based on filter, denoted by ?pfcc-ttest? in the following discussion section.

At the meantime, six widely used feature selected methods are selected to make the comparative analysis. They are the original paired t-test, ttest2, SNR, two-sample permutation t- test (denoted by ?pttest?), the rank sum test method (RankSum) and the minimum redundancy-maximum relevance (mRMR) filter method.

A. Performance of Classification Capability We evaluate the accuracy of different methods on the  multiple datasets of the same cancer type. For each cancer type, take breast cancer as an example, we carry out each method on the training dataset GSE15852 to get the gene list.

Then the top 100 genes are selected to build a SVM-based classifier. The test sets consist of four datasets GSE10810, GSE16873, GSE5764 and GSE14548. The top 100 gene prediction results of all the methods are illustrated in Fig.1.

Viewed as a whole, we can see that the prediction accuracies of our proposed method are better than others on most datasets, especially for the liver, lung, colon and breast cancer datasets. The curves of the accuracy are much higher than the others. Meanwhile, ttest2 and paired t-test methods also perform well on liver dataset, but not good in others. We have also calculated the mean accuracy of our method. The mean accuracies of the method by SVM classifier on these datasets for top 100 genes are 81.85%, 93.92%, 94.27%, 60.63%, 98.65% and 68.89%, respectively. For the other methods, take pttest method as an example, it has better performance with the top 7 genes and nearly 73% accuracy in gastric cancer dataset, but performs poorer in other datasets. The performance of our method on the multiple datasets evaluation has illustrated its effectiveness in feature selection.

B. Stability of Gene Signatures The stability of the gene lists generated by feature  selection methods reflects the robustness of these methods.

In this part, we mainly focus on the similarity of the gene lists produced by the feature selection methods. Take liver cancer as an example, we generate 10 subsets from GSE22058 by randomly choosing 80% of the paired samples and get 10 gene lists by using the feature selection methods in this paper. In order to make the statistical analysis easier and more significant, the top 500 genes of each gene list are selected to do the following analysis:  a) Compute the stability value: the ratio of overlap gene number and the number of union genes between the 10 gene lists as the stability value.

The methods with the bigger ratio value will have better stability of the gene lists. Fig. 2 shows the ratio results and their corresponding histogram. It can be seen that our proposed method has very good performance on the datasets.

It gets the biggest ratio values on four datasets except for GSE15852 and GSE19804, and they are much bigger than those from other methods. But the ratio value in GSE19804 is very close (nearly equal) to the ratio of the ttest2 method.

Meanwhile, the pttest method performs worst among all the methods. The mean value of the ratios is also shown in Fig.2.

Our method gets 0.634 on average, which is far better than those from other methods and shows better stability of the method. The SNR and RankSum methods rank second and third by their mean ratio scores, but their performance differ too much on different datasets, which indicates that it does not have a good consistency. The assessment results show that our proposed method performs well and has a good stability of gene signatures.

The ratio of intersection and union set of the 10 gene lists     b) Compute the average value of the ratio of intersection and union of every two gene lists as the stability value.

The methods with the bigger average value will have better stability of the gene lists. Table II shows the average values for the ratios of every two gene lists. We can see that our method produces the biggest average values on five datasets except for GSE15852, and the values are much bigger than those from other methods. Meanwhile, the pttest method performs worst among all the datasets. The mean of the average values is also shown in the table, and our method gets 0.849, which is far better than the other methods. The SNR and RankSum methods rank second and third by their mean scores, but they are lacking in consistency among different datasets. Through comparison, our proposed method performs well among the feature selection methods, and has consistency and stability of the gene signatures.

C. Functional Stability The functional stability of the selected genes is carried  out using DAVID. We choose threshold of Benjamini value less than 0.05 to get GO terms. At first, we use the same procedure to get the 10 gene lists and their top ten GO terms from DAVID. Then, for each pair of the 10 gene lists we compute the average ratio value of overlapping gene number and the number of union genes between the GO terms of two gene lists. Finally, the mean value of these average ratio values is calculated as the functional stability score.

The methods with the bigger score will have better functional stability. Table III shows GO term analysis of functional stability by mean value. We can see that our proposed method has better performance on the datasets. It produces the biggest mean values on five datasets except for GSE15852, and they are much bigger than the other methods.

The mean values among the different datasets are also shown in the last line in the table, and our method gets 0.899, which is far better than those from other methods. Meanwhile, we notice that RankSum and paired t-test methods rank second and third by their scores, but they are lacking in consistency among different datasets. Through comparison with other  methods, it is demonstrated that our proposed method performs well on the functional stability analysis.



IV. CONCLUSIONS Feature selection methods play an important role in the  gene expression data analysis. In this paper, we propose an effective, stable and easily used approach to select gene signatures. We improve the original paired t-test method by replacing the subtracting step with a new strategy of using fold change value. The q-value of False Discovery Rate is  also used to calculate the statistical significant in place of the original p-value. Meanwhile, we apply a strategy of decreasing the redundant genes to reduce the influence of the redundant genes. We execute our method on the datasets of six most cancer types. In the performance measurement, we focus on 1) the accuracy assessment on the multiple datasets; 2) the stability of the gene list assessment; 3) the functional stability assessment. Through comparison with other methods, the proposed method shows good performance of the accuracy and stability on most of these datasets, which supports us to believe that the proposed method is quite promising and has an applicative capability of feature selection for paired microarray expression data analysis.
