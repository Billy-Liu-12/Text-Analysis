Abstract ? For an unmanned aerial system (UAS) to work  seamlessly within the national airspace (NAS), it must have a  way to sense and avoid any obstacles autonomously. This  paper describes a monitoring system that has the ability to  monitor in real-time both the hardware and software  components of the UAS during flight operations and execute  any actions that are necessary to handle or prevent any issues  that might occur during an encounter with an obstacle as well  as during normal flight. The system was implemented and all  its capabilities were thoroughly tested using software-in-the-  loop (SWIL) flight simulations with real-time sensor data.  The  results from these tests demonstrated the system?s capabilities  to identify a component in a critical state, a software problem,  or an environmental issue and handle it in order to maintain  the Airborne Sense and Avoid (ABSAA) system?s full  capability.
