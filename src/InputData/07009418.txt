I.  INTRODUCTION With the rapid development of web technology, more and  more people go online for information, transactions and doing other business activities. Web history data contain a lot of user?s view information and is helpful for computer forensics analysis.

The cyber world provides a convenient platform for criminals to conduct their illegal activities. Web browser is one of the most commonly used tools that is used to getting information to help cybercrimes. The key part of network forensics is to collect the various sources of digital evidence.

The browser retains the user's browsing time, URL and other log information. In the web browser forensics, to analyze these logs can find some non-direct found browser behaviors of some computer users [1].

Browser behavior analysis techniques have received some attention in recent cyber forensic investigation cases [2].

Statistics show that there is a pattern on the site activities of most users [3]. It contains many repetitive movements in the long run, and it shows some unique patterns and trends.

Searching for a few weeks or even months of access history of a single client, web log mining can discover some information about these unique patterns and trends [4]. The purpose of web browsing behavior pattern mining is to provide behavioral  pattern library for identification and recognition of anonymous or suspicious web browsing behavior patterns to assist in forensics [5].

This paper presents a forensics method of web browsing behavior based on association rule mining to assist investigation of the case. How to get the user's history data of the access content, access frequency and access time, and how to use association rule mining techniques to process the user's web browsing history are mentioned in this paper.



II. RELATED WORKS Data of cyber crime cases provide a new and appropriate  auxiliary information for the detection. However, due to the data volume, the diversity of the data structure and other characteristics, analysis of the data was difficult in the past. It drew helpful information on the case manually from browsing history information. Forensics officers transformed the data into an organized database, and used criminal network analysis tools to evaluate the organized data.

Currently, some companies and organizations have issued their own web forensics tools, such as Web Historian and Forensic Tool Kit, to analyze various browsers history data.

These tools support most browsers, like Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Opera. However, and so on. However, these tools are limited to analyze the storage formats of historical data of web browser, and provide only a URL history list, cookies, cached pages and other basic information. Forensics officers still need to manually analyze electronic evidence in complex information. This operation is usually very time- consuming, and the error rate is quite high. Thus, [6] proposed a framework for finding the suspects on the basis of scientific analysis of the related web browsing history sequences and links, thereby improving the convenience and reliability of the investigation process. The authors combined data mining with web log analysis to obtain relevant information to assist discovery of cybercrime, and achieved certain results.

Application of data mining for web log analysis has achieved remarkable results in finding customers' behavioral pattern in e-commerce [7], and also achieved a lot in finding learners' behavioral pattern in e-learning [8]. The web site log     analysis has evolved from simple statistics to data mining. Web log mining technology based on transaction was first proposed by Chen [9], focusing on identifying user?s frequent browsing sequences. After that, Han proposed a web log mining technology based on data cube [10], a comprehensive mining and analysis from multiple perspectives.

Today, we can easily get the user's browsing history log files on any browser. Convenient source of the data and more favorable file structure, combined with increasingly sophisticated data mining techniques, make it possible to process the huge data files. In this paper, computer forensics in web browsing behavior pattern is discussed. The behavior pattern is important for the analysis of anonymous users and suspicious behavior. A behavior pattern library can be build by web browsing behavior pattern mining to help forensics.



III. FORENSICS MODEL OF WEB BROWSING BEHAVIOR There is a collection of suspicious web browser history in  an investigation. The main objective is to extract the user's web browsing behavior patterns. In order to get the user's browsing patterns, a forensics method of web browsing behavior based on association rule mining is presented in this paper, as shown in Fig. 1.

Figure 1.  Forensics steps of web browser behavior  In this work, the method was divided into 4 steps:  1) Collection of suspected browser history information: Collect the browser history data of suspected browser history, mainly including the user?s accessed website, accessed time, accessed method and the page classification. The original data implie the user?s web browsing information.

2) Data preprocessing: Convert the data form into the suitable data form for mining association rules. This step provides the interface to the data pattern mining layer. The purpose of this method is to get user?s browsing behavior patterns by data mining. Therefore, the data format should be suitable  for mining these results [11].

3) Mining frequently visited websites and frequent web browsing sequence: Use association rule mining algorithm to process the preprocessed data and to get the user's frequently visited websites and frequently browsing URLs sequences.

Obtaining the frequent item sets is the main objective in this step. The frequently visited websites reflect the user's point of interest, and the frequent web browsing sequence could be seen as one of the user's browsing patterns.

4) Contribution to build behavior pattern library: Case analysis usually needs to know the suspects? behavior patterns.

It is important to build behavior pattern library. A variety of computer behavior patterns make contribute to the behavior patterns library. Browsing behavior pattern including frequently visited websites and frequently browsing URLs sequences will become an important part of the behavior pattern library.



IV. PREPROCESSING USER?S BROWSERING DATA The obtaining way and the format of browse history data  are different because of different types and versions of the browser. In this paper, an example in Firefox browser history data processing will be given. In order to get the user?s frequently visited websites and frequent web browsing sequences to assist the building of behavior pattern library, we mainly gain the history data including access time, URLs, web page class, access type and session number. These are easy to be obtained in various browsers. After obtained, the data will be processed to the transactional data which are easily mined to get frequent item sets. Then the user?s frequently visited websites and frequently browsing URLs sequences can be obtained. The main processing steps show in Fig. 2.

Figure 2.  Preprocessing steps of browsing data  A. History Data of Firefox In order to discover the relationship between frequent  browsing time and frequent web browsing sequences of the suspects, it needs to know the information about web address, forward link of the web page, the time to visit the web site and the session number. The acquired data are the source of the data that are used to construct the transaction.

The history log of Firefox browser is stored in the SQlite database. The main history file is ?places.sqlite?, which is a micro database with more than one table. Among these tables, table moz_places contains the visited website addresses. Table moz_historyvisits associated with table moz_places, contains the information including access time, access type and session number.

According to different evidentiary purposes, different information is required. The corresponding mining method is not the same either. Therefore, the data sets are different because of different purpose and methods. This paper?s main idea is to get the suspect?s browsing behavior patterns in a specific time period, with the purpose to extract the points of interest and browsing behavior patterns of the suspects. The obtained data set format is shown in table I. Only a small part of the obtained data are displayed.

In order to know the suspect's frequently visited websites and frequent RUL sequence, we simply retained the host name of the URL. To keep the integrity of mining sequence, it needs to maintain the order of URL sequence in the mining process.

Class of web pages is artificial gotten from web content or roughly derived from the URL information. There may be more than one class of a website on account of different classification methods. Access type for the page indicates that the page is the start page (Denoted by 1) or linked from other page (Denoted by 0).

Construction of Transactional Database It needs to convert the obtained original data into the data  suitable for association rule mining, to get the suspect?s frequently visited websites and frequent browsing sequence within a certain time period by association rule mining to get frequent item sets. Here we just choice two dimensions of the acquired source data. A record of the transactional data can be denoted by a vector (Access time, URL).

The time dimension is a two-dimensional vector including week and period. The two fields are the week and the time period. The week dimension is naturally divided into seven values. The seven property values are from Monday to Sunday.

Then one day is artificially divided into different time periods to form the time period dimension. Considering the daily routine of most people, the time period dimension is designed as follows: midnight from 0:00 to 5:00, morning from 5:00 to 8:00, forenoon from 8:00 to 12:00, noon from 12:00 to 14:00, afternoon from 14:00 to 17:00, dusk from 17:00 to 19:00, evening from 19:00 to 0:00.

TABLE II.  FORMAT OF TRANSACTION SET  Week Period URL Sequence (Ordered  Monday Forenoon  bbs.jjwxc.net  pan.baidu.com  bbs.jjwxc.net  pan.baidu.com  bbs.jjwxc.net  weibo.com  5sing.kugou.com   The same continuous URLs are stored as one URL. The ultimate goal is to draw the user's frequently visited websites and frequent browsing sequences within a certain period of time. Whether a site appears once or several times in one transaction, the site counts are only plus one in the association rule mining process. So merge duplicate URLs sequence is reasonable, though it would lose some frequency information of the URL.

Table II shows a part of specific transaction data, which record the access time and the URL browsing sequence (The URLs sequence is sequential) in a certain time period. This example record is a browsing sequence on Monday at forenoon.



V. PATTERN ANALYSIS METHOD FOR BROWSER BEHAVIOR In this paper, we performed association rule mining on the  pretreated data to get frequent item sets. The famous algorithms to find the frequent item sets include Apriori algorithm and FP-growth algorithm [13]. Apriori algorithm is the most classical algorithm for frequent item set mining and association rule learning over transactional databases proposed by Agrawal [14]. Although the Apriori algorithm is not perfect, it is easy to understand and implement. Since the experimental data sets are small in this paper, the Apriori algorithm will be used to mine frequent item sets.

This method proceeds by identifying the frequent individual items in the transaction database and extending them to larger and larger item sets as long as those item sets appear sufficiently often in the database. The frequent item sets determined by Apriori can be used to determine association rules which highlight general trends in the database.

The method was performed on the pretreated database containing transactions. Each transaction is seen as a set of items (an item set). Then did as the following steps:  1) Given a threshold minimum support (MinSUP): The frequent item sets are subsets of at least MinSUP transactions in the database.

2) Frequent subsets were extended one item at a time (a step known as candidate generation), and groups of candidates were tested against the data: It generated candidate item sets of length K from item sets of length K-1. Then it pruned the candidates which had an infrequent sub pattern. According to the downward closure lemma, the candidate set contains all frequent K-length item sets. After that, it scaned the transaction database to determine frequent item sets among the candidates.

3) The process terminated when no further successful extensions are found.

The data of the transaction set we obtained are three- dimensional in our experiments. The user?s frequent browsing time, frequent browsing sequences and the relationship between the two were drawn from the data given by the transaction set. Fig. 3 depicts the detailed steps.

Two thresholds were set, frequent time dimension mining threshold minimum support (MinSup1) and frequent web browsing sequences threshold minimum support (MinSup2).

Figure 3.  Steps of pattern analysis for browsering behavior mode  We got frequent item sets of access time dimension by multidimensional association rule mining algorithm based on Apriori algorithm [12]. The purpose is to draw the user?s frequent browsing time, frequent browsing sequences and the relationship between the two, so the browsing sequence in the infrequent browsing time period is not important. Therefore, the items whose time period was infrequent in the transaction set would be pruned, and not involved in the next web browsing sequence mining. Then, for each frequent access time, the frequent item sets of web browsing sequences in the corresponding time period would be gotten.

Each person?s behavior pattern on using the computer to surf the Internet or communicate with people, including web browsing behavior pattern, commonly used word sequences and other specific behaviors, can be used to form an individual behavior pattern library to assist in the identification and recognition of anonymous or suspicious web behavior pattern.

Mining a series of transaction records of the suspect for a period of time by association rule mining, may get the user?s frequent browsing time, frequent browsing sequences and the relationship between the two in a specified time period. The mining results also make contributions to the building of the behavior pattern library.



VI. EXPERIMENTS AND ANALYSIS  A.  Personal  Frequent Item Sets The experimental data were two students? web browser  history in two weeks on summer vacation. Set MinSup1 = 0.3, MinSup2 = 0.6. Eighteen transaction records were constructed by the history data of student A. After the screening it left 14 records. Nineteen transaction records were constructed by the history data of student B. After the screening it left 15 records.

The experimental results are shown in Table III and Table IV.

Table III shows the mining results of student A. The first line of Table III displayed the user's frequently access time to the web. As we can see in the table, the user was often access web in the period of ?forenoon? and ?Tuesday? in the two weeks.

One-frequent sequences are the frequent browsing pages of student A. The results in Table III show that student A frequently visited these websites like micro blog, Jinjiang Literature City forums and some original music sites. The frequently-used network resource sharing platform was Baidu  cloud platform in the two weeks. The value of the results ?hao.360.cn? and ?login.sina.com.cn? is not significant, so it should be removed in the results.

Frequent web browsing sequence was composed of a set of ordered URLs. Two frequent sequences in Table III indicate that there are two common browsing habits of student A. The first one is that the user visited the Jinjiang Literature City Forum in the forenoon, followed by using Baidu cloud network disk to upload or download resources. The second browsing habit is that the user accessed micro blog in the forenoon, followed by visiting some original music website.

Student B visited CSDN (Chinese software developer net) frequently in the two weeks.

And student B liked seeing movies in Youku video site. It is different from student A who likes listening music. The     frequent browsing time is evening that are also different from student A. The frequent browsing sequences are also different from student A. These results of different person are always different. Therefore, the results provide support to build the behavior pattern library for investigation.

B. Stability of a Person?s Frequent Browsing Sequence After that, in order to show the stability of the user  browsing habits, we did the experiment again in different history data of student A. Sina micro disk conducted a file investigation. Micro disk users can not use the site to upload and download files during the investigation. The two weeks history records of the same user in the same browser before the investigation began were analyzed. The results in Table V illustrates that even if the file-sharing sites are different, the user's browsing patterns is consistent with the previous patterns.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS BEFORE MICRODISK INVESTIGATION  1-Dimensional Frequent Item Sets Forenoon support: 0.705882  Frequent Web  Browsing Sequences  1-frequent sequences  Sequence Support Forenoon:  weibo.com 0.923077  Forenoon: 5sing.kugou.com 0.846154  Forenoon: vdisk.weibo.com 0.846154  Forenoon: bbs.jjwxc.net 0.846154  Forenoon: hao.360.cn 0.692308  Forenoon: login.sina.com.cn 0.692308  Forenoon: www.baidu.com 0.615385  2-frequent sequences  Forenoon: weibo.com  5sing.kugou.com 0.846154  Forenoon: bbs.jjwxc.net  vdisk.weibo.com 0.769231    Comparing Table III and Table V, we noticed that the user used Baidu cloud disk to upload and download files during the investigation, but used the Sina micro disk before the investigation. Thus, it can be seen that a person's browsing habits are not easy to change. The user usually shared files after he visited Jinjiang Literature City forum, no matter what network storage tools the user used. This habit has not changed, just like using the micro blog access the original music site. Both habits are his inherent browsing habits.

C. Effect of Different Experimental Parameters Different parameters result in different results. The  selection of minimum supports has a great impact on the number of frequent item sets. The browsing history data of student B were analyzed by us. The results show in Table VI.

The experimental results show that under the same MinSUP1, the greater the MinSUP2 is, the less frequent web  browsing sequences are obtained. But under the same MinSUP2, the relationship of the number of frequent web browsing sequences and MinSUP1 is not clear, because the items whose time period are infrequent in the transaction set are pruned. The number of frequent web browsing sequences would affect the building of behavior pattern library and would have a great impact on the later recognition and identification of the suspicious behavior.

TABLE VI.  COMPARISON OF THE DIFFERENT MINIMUM SUPPORTS  MinSUP1 MinSUP2  1-Dimensional Frequent Item Sets (Frequent Access Time)  Frequent Web Browsing Sequences  1-frequent sequences  2-frequent sequences  0.1  0.4   6 6  0.5 6 2  0.6 4 1  0.7 2 0  0.8 0 0  0.3  0.4   6 6  0.5 6 5  0.6 6 2  0.7 4 1  0.8 1 0    In order to better support the later pattern recognition, we need to maintain the right number of the user?s frequent browsing item sets, not too many and not too few. Good minimum supports should be chosen. Comparing multiple results in Table VI, the best setting in this experiment should be MinSUP1=0.3, MinSUP2=0.6.

In summary, the experiments show that the results obtained using association rule mining for each user is special and stabile. Therefore, the results can be used to build the behavior pattern library. The building of the behavior pattern library is important for the analysis of anonymous users and suspicious behavior. And the setting of minimum support will affect the number of web browsing patterns, which has a great impact on the forensic investigation. We should continue to try and contrast in order to get a better minimum support.



VII. CONCLUSION In this paper, a forensics method of web browsing behavior  based on association rule mining was proposed, and the calculating steps were given. The experiments were carried out in the actual browsing history data. The experiments show a good results which is  helpful to analyze and identify patterns of criminal behavior. In the experiment, the choice of parameter values were also thought about. According to actual needs, several experiments were conducted by us. Finally, we got the general rules of parameter setting.

In conclusion, this method has a good effect on helping web forensics. The experiments further validate the feasibility and rationality of this method. The setting of minimum support will affect the number of web browsing patterns, which has a great impact on the forensic investigation. However, the experiments are not perfect. For example, the experimental results were not intuitive, and the meaning of parameters is not clear enough.

Currently, we carried out some useful exploration and research in the behavior pattern mining. However, identification of crime patterns has not been taken into account, and only some initial results have we achieved. Many technologies are still implemented in the lab. There are many practical issues needed further study. There are also many problems waiting for us to solve. The construction of the behavior pattern library will gradually improve in the future studies.
