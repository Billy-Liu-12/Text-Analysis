If You Build It, They Will Use: Usage Motivations and Unintended Effects of  the Internet Village Motoman Project in Rural Cambodia

Abstract   The adoption of community wireless has become a  growing trend in both metropolitan and rural areas around the world. However, understanding the usage motivations and the unintended effects that those technologies have on communities is limited particularly for rural users. The purpose of this study is to explore the benefits and usage of an asynchronous wireless Internet system in a rural village of Cambodia. By employing qualitative methods of in- depth case analysis we revealed various usage motivations and unintended effects of the system. We derived five motivations of users to use the system; avowed identity, mean to an end, maintaining personal ties, power influence, and psychological commitment and ownership. Unintended effects of the system were the increase in interactions among actors and other forms of system usages including; Internet commerce, telemedicine, and e-government.

1. Introduction   This study attempts to explore the case of an ICT adoption in the rural area of Cambodia. Cambodia is a small south-east Asian country with the population of approximately 13 millions. The telecommunication infrastructure of the country is very poor; the coverage is available only in the main cities and provincial towns. With the combined fixed and mobile penetration rate of only around 1.54 percent in 2003, Cambodia is one of the least connected countries in the region. The annual average per capita income of the villagers is around $40 according to the government data in 2005.

In 2003, some of the most remote villagers in the country experienced the leapfrog to the Wireless Internet by using a technology called DakNet. Created by the First Mile Solutions, DakNet is an asynchronous wireless system that employs the existing communication infrastructure to deliver digital contents like e-mail and the Internet to the villagers  [14]. The project, known as ?Internet Village Motoman Project? was initiated by a Non Governmental Organization (NGO) called the American Assistance for Cambodia and Japan Relief for Cambodia (AAC/JRC) supported by the fund from private donors and the matched fund from Asian Development Bank and the World Bank. It is so named because, they use Wi-Fi equipped motorcycles as mobile access points (MAPs) to synchronize e-mails and the Internet content between the satellite dish situated at the hub or the Internet access point and the computer(s) in the schools (see figure 1 and figure 2). The persons who ride on the motorcycle are called the e-mailmen (or motomen in Cambodian because ?moto? means motorcycle).

Figure 1. The Motoman with Mobile Access Point (MAP) downloads and uploads the content when the motorcycle is in the Wi-Fi range   The project is considered a success because not only students and teachers in the schools use the e-mail to communicate with their peers in other places and abroad but the community leaders and villagers also use it to send complaints and requests to the provincial governor [13] it is also used to transfer data between the telemedicine clinic in the district and the telemedicine partners in the U.S.A. Furthermore, the systems also serve as e-commerce infrastructure enable the villagers to sell their products including woven      accessories, silk clothes and shawls to everyone in the world at villageleap.com.

In this case the technology has been pushed to the community of villagers and highlanders from champion(s) in the AAC/JRC. It was intended primarily for the students and teachers in the schools that were built as part of AAC/JRC project to support their learning and teaching. However, the use of the systems expanded beyond the intended users to include other users like tribal highlanders, the government officers, the commune and village chiefs and community at large. Understand the motivations of those user situated in the remote and rural environment might help in the success of implementing similar system elsewhere. Furthermore, finding out what are the unintended effects or benefits of such system can improve the likelihood of making a convincing case for the investment in similar system to the public and the government. These are the main objectives of this study.

2. Backgrounds and literature review  2.1. The Internet Motoman Project  As noted earlier, the wireless Internet system was essentially built for teachers and students to support their teaching and learning.  Schools that involve in the Internet motoman project are located in remote  provinces such as Ratanakiri and Preah Vihear and rural province like Koh Kong.

Take the elementary school in Koh Kong, it is an elementary school that has four public school teachers and one NGO?s teacher. The NGO?s teacher was not a civil servant and he taught English and computer that were not part of the public school curriculum. Since it is not part of the curriculum the English and computer lessons are enrolled on a voluntary basis.

The site was a hub (Internet access point) serving another school located in a different province. A motoman is responsible for this route. There were five PCs in the schools. They are connected to the Internet via a satellite dish. The power line did not run close to that area, so they had a generator as a power source. In the evenings, teachers, students and parents took turn to guard the generator and computers.

2.2. Literature review  Usage motivations   Literature pertaining to system usage is rich and well developed. Theoretical bases include the concepts of the new institutionalists [4, 17, 18], social constructionists [5, 6], and cognitive approach such as the technology acceptance model [3]. As opposed to the slim de-contextualized user that has been viewed in the traditional cognitive based IS research (e.g. TAM), the new institutionalists and social constructionists take into account the contextual factors that drive system usage. Based on theoretical lenses of new institutionalists and social constructionists; Lamb and Kling [9] proposed the reconceptualization of user as social actor. In their four-dimensional social actor framework, affiliations, environments, interactions, and identities are foci of attention.

Few other theoretical approaches such as diffusion of innovation and uses and gratifications approach are also informative to understand the usage motivations.

For instance, diffusion of innovation research [16] that focus on the communication of the technological innovation to potential adopters in a social setting is one of the most notable theory that has been widely used in media studies and information system use.

Characteristics of innovation that influence the rate of adoption are; relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, and observability of the use of new technology. Moreover, uses and gratifications is a functional approach that often used to explore why users choose certain media or technology innovations.

These two theoretical approaches are more appropriate for the technological innovation for individual adopter but not quite appropriate to explain the contextual rich      of the users of the community based wireless network that we studied.

We aim to understand user motivations to use the wireless Internet system. Using Lamb and Kling?s framework is appropriate, because their framework takes into account the complexity of the social users.

Wireless Internet system usage in rural and remote area involves complex factors that the thin-user view of traditional TAM [3] might not take into account. For example, the parents of the students who involved the motoman project are enablers who help guard the hardware and encourage students to learn English and computer skills.

The use of the wireless Internet system involves complex motivations. Understanding these motivations will contribute greatly to the success of the system implementation and the diffusion of the Internet in rural Cambodia, given that the Internet infrastructure is yet underdeveloped.  Hence, we ask the first research question:   Q1: What are the motivations of the users to use the  wireless Internet system?

From previous studies, we found that five users  motivations were related to the community based wireless network under investigation. These five users motivations are avowed identity, mean to an end, maintaining personal ties, power influence, and psychological commitment and ownership. These motivations have been found related to technology use.

For instance, cell phone usage was driven by identity motivation. In the early stage of cell phone adoption, having a cell phone represented a better social status of users. Mean to an end refer to the perceived system utility that is similar to perceived usefulness in TAM.

In rural Cambodia, the wireless Internet system is regarded as an enabler to their future success so that they embrace and use the technology. Likewise, perceived usefulness in TAM predicts system usage because of one?s belief that a useful system is able to improved his/her job performance. Power influence refers to what users gained from the knowledge of the system usage. Maintaining social tie by using information communication technology (ICT) was supported Haythornthwaite?s study [7]. Psychological commitment and ownership refers to the feeling of possessiveness and of being psychological tied to an object [15]. In the data analysis and results sections, we will discuss each of the motivations in greater detail.

Unintended effects/benefits   Unintended consequences refer to the adverse  social and economical effects of regulatory actions by  government. The concept is used in different disciplines such as economics, social action [12], and technological realm [8]. Network technologies bring effects to teamwork and collaboration. The most apparent one is the intended technological effects such as faster processing, fewer error, and equal participation. Network technologies also bring unintended technological social effects such as heightened conflict [8]. The wireless Internet system in rural Cambodia was essentially adopted for assisting teaching and learning; however, it brings unintended effects and benefits to the community that uses this new technological innovation. It is important to identify these effects and benefits because they can make a stronger case for future investment in similar systems to the public and the government.  We therefore ask the second research question:   Q2: What are the unintended effects/benefits of the  wireless Internet system?

Based on the nature of the research questions and  the unit of observation (the user group), a qualitative method would be the most appropriate research method for data collection. In the following section, we present research methodology of our pilot study.

3. Methodology   According to Yin [20], a case study is used when a  researcher wants to explore contextual conditions and to examine in depth the complexity of social phenomena. This approach is particularly relevant to examination of an environment where the boundaries between the phenomenon of interest and context are not clearly evident. The research questions are explanatory by nature and the use of in-depth case studies, based on semi-structured interviews, is the most appropriate research method. Through the use of case studies it is possible to ask penetrating questions and to capture the richness of subjects? social interactions and to provide better explanations of the researched phenomena than the standardized structured questionnaires.

We conducted a pilot study in a school in Koh Kong province. The Internet (motoman project) has been in service for seven months when we was there.

We chose this site based on the availability and ease of access, the schools in other remote provinces like Ratanakiri and Preah Vihear are inaccessible by road in the rainy season.

Data was collected mainly through in-depth semi- structured interviews with one representative from AAC/JRC, three students, one computer and English teacher, one school principal, one Motoman and a      student?s parents. Some secondary data from the Internet Village Motoman Project case in Preah Vihea province (Roveang) and in Ratanakiri (O Siengle) were also used to enrich the case. Roveang is a village in the northern part of Cambodia, it was among the first remote schools that had access to the Internet and their achievement was well publicized due to its e- commerce project. O Siengle is another village in Ratanakiri province whose case has been considered another success because of the telemedicine project.

4. Data analysis and results   In this section we present the data of the pilot study  with support from theoretical bases and findings in existing literature. Usage motivations and unintended effects were the focus of the analysis.

3.1. Usage motivations   One of the theoretical basis used in this study is the concept of user as social actor as opposed to the slim de-contextualized user that has been viewed in the traditional cognitive based IS research. This view of user was originated from the concepts of the new institutionalists [4, 17, 18] and social constructionists [5, 6]. Based on these theoretical lenses; Lamb and Kling [9] proposed the reconceptualization of user as social actor. They defined social actor as ?an organizational entity whose interactions are simultaneously enabled and constrained by the socio- technical affiliations and organizational environments, its members, and its industry.? (pp. 218) They proposed a four-dimension social actor framework which is comprised of: affiliations, environments, interactions, and identities. Taking into account the complexity of the social users we strive to understand the motivations of the Internet Village Motoman users in using the system. For example the parents were not the users of the system that we visited, however, they are enabler. They helped to guard the hardware at night and encourage their kids to take the computer and English lessons. The thin-user view of traditional technology adoption model [3] might not take the parents into account.

Diffusion of innovation research [16] focus on the communication of the technological innovation to potential adopters in a social setting. Characteristics of innovation that influence the rate of adoption are; relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, and observability of the use of the technology. This theoretical view is more appropriate for the adoption of technological innovation by individual but not quite appropriate to explain the  contextual rich of the users of the community based wireless network that we studied.

From the interview data we derived five motivations of the users to use the system; avowed identity, mean to an end, maintaining personal ties, power influence, and psychological commitment and ownership. The following sections will describe the five motivations in detail.

Avowed identity   A Student with the support of his parents switches  school because he wants to learn computer and English lessons. ?My parents encourage me to learn computer because it is good for my future ?my parents said that if you don?t learn English and computer you will have to do the labor job?? This was a kind of avowed identity [9] that the student and his parents want to present to others because being able to speak English show that he is in a better position to seek job than other students, therefore a higher status in the society.

This concept is similar to the observability (result demonstrability) of the diffusion of innovation research.

A mean to an end   Some students used the technology, because they want to study English and computer skills for their future job hunting even they are not mandated by the organization (ministry of education). ?I learn computer and the Internet because I will be able to find a job with these skills.? In this case the system usage is just a mean toward an end. It is the perceived utility of the system similar to the construct of perceived usefulness of TAM [3]. When students see technology as an enabler to their future success they embrace it and learnt to use the technology although it is not required for their graduation. This motivation is a step further from the avowed identity, because it is based on intrinsic motivation while using technology as an identity statement is more an extrinsic motivation.

Maintaining personal ties   One student wanted to learn e-mail because she  likes to communicate with her previous English teacher. Similarly, the school principal wanted to learn to use e-mail because he needs to communicate with his relatives in the United States. Two other students that we interviewed had no interest in learning e-mail because they don?t know to whom they can write. They use the Internet to listen to music. The principal also wanted to learn e-mail to communicate with his relatives in the United States. The strength of ties      among actors determines the motivation to use the system. This finding is supported by the finding of Haythornthwaite [7] who stated that when the ties among actors are strong the addition of a new mean of communication supports the needs and tasks of the pair better than when the tie is weak.

Power and influence   Power and influence are rather an inhibitor than a motivator of system usage. In our case it was not a kind of direct power that was mentioned in Markus? study, but it was the power and influence gained from the knowledge of the system usage. There were two types of teachers; those who work for NGO and those who are public servants. Teachers in public schools have no access to the technology. The principal put it: ?We want to learn computer but it is complicated to turn the computer on we need to turn generator on, the gas is expensive and the NGO?s teacher have no time for us.? The manifestation of the power and influence by the government on the usage behavior of public school teacher is another example of how power and influence determine usage behavior. Politics were not allowed to be discussed in the school. Although the public school teachers use The Internet mainly for news that is political in nature, they don?t talk about the news to their peers. One teacher said ?..since the politics are always a sticky issue, we don?t talk about them that much, ? we access the Internet mainly for news.? However, when students find an interesting music site they share with their peers.

Psychological commitment and ownership   Due to the lack of power source the system was  relied on the solar power and the diesel generator. The computers and those equipments need to be safeguarded especially at night. Teachers, students and parents took turn to guard the generator and computers every night. This sense of community is rarely manifested in metropolitan area. This commitment by user and non-users enable an uninterrupted functioning of the system.

Nicholas Negroponte, the director of MIT Media Lab who witnessed the use of computer by the kids in the school that he donated money to build noted that when the computer was given to student to keep at home they take care of the computer as if it was a precious object and the whole family cherishes the laptop [11]. This behavior can be explained with the concept of psychological ownership. ?The core of psychological ownership is the feeling of possessiveness and of being psychological tied to an object? [15]. Commitment and ownership are different.

Psychological ownership answers the question ?What do I feel is mine?? whereas commitment answers the question ?Should I maintain my membership in this organization and why?because I ought to, I need to, and/or because I want to?.? [15]. Ownership implies the right to control while commitment implies responsibilities.

3.2. Unintended effects   The concept of unintended consequences is often  referred to the adverse social and economical effects of regulatory actions by government. However, Adam Smith?s ?invisible hand,? the most famous metaphor in economics, is an example of a positive unintended consequence of individual seeking his/her own gain.

Merton [12] outlined five sources of unintended consequences of purposive social action. They are: lack of knowledge, human error, imperious immediacy of interest, basic values, and self-defeating prediction.

In technological realm, Kiesler [8] observed three types of effects of a network technology: ?intended technological effects? (faster processing, fewer errors, more equal participation), ?unintended social effects? (heightened conflict), and ?transient effects? (effects that will diminish with group experience with the system). In our case the intended technological effects were better learning for students and teachers.

Unintended social effects that we observed in this study were the increase in interactions among actors and other forms of technological usages including: the Internet commerce, telemedicine, and e-government.

We might be able to observed some transient effects in the site in which the system has been implemented longer like in Ratanakiri or Preah Vihea.

Increase interactions   The use of the system increased the interactions  among actors. The most successful unintended link is that between the handicraft and the Internet. Another important unintended link was between the clinic and the medical doctor in Boston, the U.S.A. This link enables the doctor in Boston to diagnose the disease of villagers that cannot be diagnosed by the clinic staff or the doctor in the city. However, in the site that we visited some intended interactions were not realized.

The computer mediated links between the public teachers and NGO teachers and between the public teachers and the students were not realized due to the time and resource constraints.

Figure 3. Intended and Unintended Interactions   Internet commerce   This link was not previously intended but was made  possible by a very strong and personal support from Bernard Krisher the director of the AAC/JRC. The system enables villagers from the province of Preah Vihea to sell their silk handicraft to the world via the Internet. Main customers are from the U.S.A and Japan. The villageleap.com checkout page is cable of processing credit card transaction in English or Japanese. The system is connected to the transaction processing system of the business of a Japanese entrepreneur whom Mr. Krisher knows personally.

Telemedicine   The one-staff clinic in the Village O Siengle of  Ratanakiri province used the system to diagnose patience having mild health problem with the help of the doctors in the provincial hospital. For patience with serious illness the staff arranges the transportation to the provincial hospital where more advanced test and diagnostics are performed. For hard-to-diagnose diseases the doctors in the provincial hospital can send photographs of patients, X-rays, ultrasounds, and electrocardiograms to specialists in Boston at Partners Telemedicine. Doctors from Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School then review the files and send diagnoses, all pro bono [2].

E-government   Although it was not intended, a crude form of e-  government was taking shape with the introduction of the system in O Siengle village. In one meeting of the villagers, they were debating how to send their first email message to the governor ?I think we should send  a message to the governor asking for land titles? a villager said [2]. A village chief was reported using e- mail to send his report to his superior in the provincial government according a local press.

5. Discussion  5.1. Key findings   From available data we determined five motivations of users to use the system; 1) system was used as avowed identity statement, 2) systems usage is a mean to achieve a greater end, 3) system usage to maintain personal ties with friends and colleagues, 4) systems usage was limited by power and influence, and 5) system usage is enable by the psychological commitment and ownership of non users and users.

Unintended social and economical effects of community wireless system were; 1) the increase in interactions among actors, 2) Internet commerce, 3) telemedicine, and 4) e-government. However, it is to note that all those unintended effects might not have been realized without a strong champion. A great deal of efforts from champion of the system like Mr.

Krisher and MIT Media Lab were the drivers behind all those effects.

The pilot study is an exploratory effort to better understand the Internet usage motivations and unintended effects that come alone with the Internet technology. Theoretical contribution of this paper is that Lamb and Kling?s [9] framework is adopted in a non-organization setting. We found that their framework is an appropriate approach to observe actors? interaction, environment, and affiliations.

Under this framework we identify the usage motivations that are richer than those posited in the cognitive theory of adoption which is often found to be significant drivers of system usage in organizational settings.

For practice, the results of this study shed light on the actor?s roles (students, teachers, government officers) in the wireless Internet system. The motivations identified in our study suggested that users in rural Cambodia are driven by very different needs from those users in developing and developed countries where Internet infrastructure is mostly well established. Fulfilling these needs will contribute to a successful implementation of a new Internet projects in other rural areas and ultimately help close the digital divide. Identifying the unintended effects contributes to the future success of system implementation as well.

We figure out the use of the Internet as tools for more interaction, e-commerce, telemedicine, and e- government. For best interest of users, government and      NGOs may allocate more resources in these aspects so that users can be benefited fully by the power of the Internet technology.

5.2. Limitations   We must clarify the limitation of the site that we  selected. Since it was a new site (only seven months of introduction to the Internet); the students and all public school teachers didn?t know how to use e-mail and the Internet yet. That was probably one reason of limited interactions among actors. Another reason is the existence of alternative technology (e.g. cell phone, communication network, and radio communication).

The site is on the major highway linking the province of Koh Kong to the capital city. More interaction among users might be found in a site without alternative forms of communication to the outside world.

5.3. Future study   Encouraging by the results of the pilot study, we propose to conduct another study in the province of Ratanakiri during the summer of 2009. We will use a case study method by employing both face-to-face in depth interview and phone interview as means of data collection. We will also examine some forms and written correspondence between the actors [1]. The participants of the study will be the villagers, students, teachers, government officers, community leaders, telemedicine clinic staffs, and the champion(s) of the Internet Village Motoman Project.

We narrow the scope to the northeastern province of Cambodia named Rattanakiri. The is composed of fifteen solar-powered village schools, a telemedicine clinics, and the governor?s office in Ban Lung , the provincial capital city of Ratanakiri, five Honda motorcycles equipped with mobile access points and a satellite uplink. Each of the schools can send and receive email and browse the Internet using a non-real- time search engine. We limit the case to one Internet access point in Ban Lung, three schools, one telemedicine clinic and the orphanage center (AAC/JRC) in the capital city who supplies the English and computer teachers to the schools.

We expect to fully understand the usage motivations of ICT of students, villagers, teachers and clinic staff in this rural setting. We also expect a better understanding of the unintended benefits of the use of Wireless Internet system because, in Ratanakiri the projects is more complete in the sense that not only students and teachers use the systems but community leaders, staffs in the telemedicine clinic and entrepreneurs also use the systems. Furthermore, they  have limited means of communication; the only alternative mean of communication to outside world is through radio. By conducting research in a different site, the limitation of this currently study will be managed. Since the province of Koh Kong has started the Internet project for less than one year and users have multiple ways to communicate with each other, the interaction among the users cannot be observed.

We hope that the limitation can be fully managed in the future study in Ratnakiri.

6. Conclusion  This study explores the wireless Internet project known as ?Internet Village Motoman Project? that was initiated by a Non Governmental Organization (NGO) with the support of the fund from private donors and the matched fund from Asian Development Bank and the World Bank. We investigate usage motivations and unintended effects of the wireless Internet system in Koh Kong province. Data was collected by using  in- depth semi-structured interviews with one representative from AAC/JRC, three students, one computer and English teacher, one school principal, one Motoman and a student?s parents. Some secondary data from the Internet Village Motoman Project case in Preah Vihea province (Roveang) and in Ratanakiri (O Siengle) were also used to enrich the case. We found five usage motivations related to Internet use: avowed identity, a mean to an end, maintaining personal ties, power influence, and psychological commitment and ownership. Unintended effects emerged from the Internet system use are the increase in interactions among actors, Internet commerce, telemedicine, and e- government. A future study will be conducted to have more understanding in other rural Cambodia areas to attest our current theoretical findings and hopefully to contribute our findings to practice.
