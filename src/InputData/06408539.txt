Generating association rules between items in a large video database plays a significant role in the video mining research areas. Applications of video association mining are not limited to the domains of surveillance, meetings, news broadcast, sports, video on demand (VOD), telemedicine, biomedical engineering and as well as online media collections. This paper concentrates on a knowledge-based system to generate association rules for selecting video categories using ?Belief Rule Base (BRB)?. It has been shown that the system is efficient than traditional association rule mining.

I. INTRODUCTION  Association rule mining plays an important role in discovering interesting patterns from databases. It provides semantic interrelationship between transactional databases [1].

Video association rule mining (VARM) considers relationship between high-level semantic video data [3]. This is a challenging and difficult task due to semantic gap between low-level and high-level featured and semantic video data respectively [3]. Video database considers two content types: i) Spatial and ii) Temporal. Particular objects of video frames are described as spatial content whether sequence of frames over time is denoted as temporal content [4]. B. Siva Selvan et al and Omar U et al [8,9] Worked in mining associations from video frame sequences. They used apriori-based and FP- Growth algorithms. In this paper belief rule based model [1,2] is used to find association rules from video categories. Further the rules can be categorized for enabling the accessibility of the video types.

The rest of the paper organized as follows: in the next section a brief description on Evidential Reasoning (ER) presented, section 3 considered Belief Rule Based Expert System for creating knowledge based video association rule mining, in section 4 a comparative study on BRB and Video Association Rule Mining (VARM) is depicted, a methodology  for creating knowledge based association rules for accessing video categories is presented in section 5, the performance of the system is elucidated in section 6 finally section 7 concluded the paper following some future directions.



II. EVIDENTIAL REASONING  The evidential reasoning approach (ER) is an evidence- based multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) method for dealing with difficulties having both quantitative and qualitative criteria under various uncertainties including ignorance, vagueness and randomness [14]. It has been used to support various decision analysis, assessment and evaluation activities such as environmental impact assessment [12], organizational self-assessment [13], weather prediction [15], image quality enhancement [16] etc. based on a range of quality models. The ER employs an evidential reasoning algorithm developed on the basis of decision theory and the evidence contribution rule of Dempster-Shafer theory to aggregate belief degrees [5,6,7]. Selecting a desired video category may have the following four evaluation grades: {H1, H2, H3, H4}={Slightly Preferred, Moderately Preferred, Preferred, Greatly Preferred}. Suppose there are M alternatives, Yj (j=1,?.M), to choose from and N attributes, Ai (i=1,?,N) to consider. Using four evaluation grades, the assessment of an alternative X1 on an attribute Y1, denoted by S (X1 (Y1)) can be represented by the following belief structure:  S(X1(Y1))={ 1,1,H1, 2,1,H2, 3,1,H3, 4,1,H4} (1) Where 1>= n,1>=0 (n=1,?4) denotes the degree of belief that the attribute A1 is assessed to the evaluation grade Hn.

Just as equation (1) the second S (X2 (Y1)) is given by S(X2(Y1))={ 1,2,H1, 2,2,H2, 3,2,H3, 4,2,H4} (2) An average score for X1, denoted by u(X1) , can also be provided as the weighted average of the scores (utilities) of the evaluation grades with the belief degrees as       weights, or u(X1) =  )(  i iiHu (3)  In (3) u (Hi) is the utility of the i-th evaluation grade Hi. If evaluation grades are assume to be equidistantly distributed in the utility space, for example, the utilities of the evaluation grades can be given as follows: u(H1) = u ( Slightly preferred ) = 0.25.

u(H2 = u ( Moderately preferred ) = 0.50.

u(H3) = u (Preferred ) = 0.75.

u(H4) = u ( Greatly preferred ) = 1.00.

ER used an extended judgments matrix. This extended matrix can be represented in the following table 1. The values of extended judgments matrix are considering from the following table 2.

In the next section Belief Rule Base (BRB) Expert System will be presented. BRB is based on the theory of Evidential Reasoning.



III. BELIEF RULE BASE (BRB) EXPERT SYSTEM  The starting point of constructing a rule-based system is to collect if?then rules from human experts or based on domain knowledge. For example kth rule of a belief structure Rk is expressed as follows: IF (X1 is A1k) (X2 is A2k ) ??. (  k Tk  A ) Then {(D1, 1,k), (D2, 2,k), ????., (DN, N,k)},  ( N  i ik  1)     Where Aik (i=1,??,Tk ) is the referential value of the ith antecedent and Tk the number of antecedent attributes used in the kth rule . ik (i=1,?..,N) is the belief degree to which Di is believed to be consequent if (X1, X2, ?..

kT X ) = (A1k, A2k ,  ???.., kTkA ). L is the number of all rules in the rule base.

If N  i ik  1 then kth rule is said to be complete; otherwise,  it is incomplete. In the next section it will be shown that how BRB can be associated with Video Association Rule Mining (VARM).



IV. BRB AND VIDEO ASSOCIATION RULE MINING  Association rule determine relationship among a set of items in a database [8,9]. It follows unsupervised learning and has been applied to many filed such as web mining, text mining, e-business, video data mining etc [1,3,4]. The most challenging part of association rule inference involves finding sets of items, which satisfy specific criteria and intern, are used to infer the rules themselves. Association rules are inferred based on support and confidence [1]. Support refers to the percentage of occurrences of the rules in the database and confidence reflects the strength of the rule. Video association mining reveals relationship between objects of video scenes. It can be applicable to relate video shots and can identify relationship between shot and scenes for semantic representation of videos. It differs with traditional association rule mining due to temporal nature of video database.

Traditional association rule contains only antecedent and consequent. The left portion of the rule is antecedent and result portion of the rule is consequent. The following is the  form of traditional association rule:  X (Antecedent) Y (Consequent). Association rules can be inferred by two numerical measurements such as support and confidence.

Percentage of occurrence of the rule in the database is denoted as support where confidence indicates the strength of the rule [9].  In contrast with association rule, BRB Uses evaluation grade in both antecedent and consequent part. It is illustrated in section (3). The following is the simple form of a BRB based association rule: X (A1k, A2k , ???..,  k Tk  A ) Y{{(D1, 1,k), (D2, 2,k), ???., (DN, N,k)}}                                                             (4)  X can take values from A1k, A2k,????.., k Tk  A . Where A1k is the referential value of the 1st antecedent of the kth rule and Tk the number of antecedent attributes used in the kth rule, i,k (i= 1?.N) is the belief degree to which Di is believed to be the consequent.



V. KNOWLEDGE BASED (KBS) ASSOCIATION RULE MINING FOR SELECTING VIDEO  CATEGORIES  In a knowledge-based system, information pertained from knowledge engineers, expert choices or from domain knowledge [10,11]. This qualitative information further transformed into some rules which are based on linguistic terms. The rules then optimize some decision-making problem taking qualitative information as input variables then convert it in some quantitative form and finally make a decision in semantic form. A block diagram of knowledge based association rule mining for selecting video categories is presented in the following figure.

Figure 1. Framework of KBS Association Rule Mining for Selecting Video Categories.

In this research qualitative information have been taken from domain expert as shown in table 1 and 2. Belief rule based association rules can be created as depicted in section 3 and 4. It is different from traditional IF?.THEN rules. In table 2 antecedents ?X? can take five parameters (Bibliographic, Compositional, Sensory Content, Topic Content and Structural) and ?Y? also take five parameters (VOD, Research, I-Video, Document and Shot-Stock).

Consequent take four evaluation grades (no, high, low and medium). Therefore, from this domain knowledge, at most 25  (5X5) rules can be created as shown in table 3. For example rule number 12 is illustrated as follows: IF (X2 AND Y3) THEN Assessment (H1, 0, H2, 0, H3, 0.1, H4, 0.9) =0.975 [using equation 3]  Steps to analyze knowledge based association rules for selecting video categories:  1. Create association rules based on expert choices.

This categorization is depicted in the following sub section.

It has been shown in the figure 2 that video scores 0.975, 0.6875, 0.5625, 0.3125 and 0.275 extracted 13, 4, 1, 3 and 4 association rules respectively. Another quantitative analysis presented in table 9. It can be seen that if minimum support is 0.1 then 9 rules to be extracted and user?s can select research or I-Video categories. Rule number 11?15 indicate research type videos and 21, 22, 23 and 25 indicates I-Video. Similarly minimum support 0.05 indicates total 17 rules, which categorized research, I-Video, document, Shot-Stock and VOD video types. It means all five categories of videos can be extracted by setting minimum support as 0.05.

VII. CONCLUSION  This research illustrated a knowledge-based system for extracting association rules from different video categories and finally makes a decision of accessing video types. The system considered some qualitative video information from expert choices and domain knowledge. This information further converted to belief rule based association rules. The assessment of these rules has been calculated by using Dempster-Shafer based Evidential Reasoning method. From the assessment values, measure of support identified which further considered creating different classes of association rules. Each class contains some specific types of video categories. Finally users can be accessed some specific types of video categories by setting min_sup threshold. The work focused on accumulating traditional association and belief rule so that mitigating contradictions between qualitative and quantitative data analysis of different video types. In this paper video data types and its categories have been considered to solve this problem. This work can be extendable for a large set of video categories and also workable for video content assessment.
