Abstract?Radar emitter signal identification is a special  issue of data clustering for classifying unknown radar  emitters. In this paper, an efficient approach for  automatic classification of radar emitter signals in  multisensor systems is proposed. The proposed approach  exploits measured features extracted from multiple  sensors as well as the sensor accuracies for classification  of unknown multiple radar targets. The proposed  approach can easily be applied to any number of sensors  with different accuracies, any number of emitters, and  any number of measured features without exponential  growing of the required computations. The performance  of the proposed classification approach is evaluated in  terms of percentage of correct classification and  compared to other classification approaches. The results  show the feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed  classification approach.
