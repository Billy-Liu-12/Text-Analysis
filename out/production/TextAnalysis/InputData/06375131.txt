I. INTRODUCTION   Because of advancement in digital imaging techniques such as Magnetic Resonance (MR), Ultrasonograpy (US), Projectional Computed Radiography (CR), Computed Tomography (CT), and Position Emission Tomography (PET), the use of image technology in medicine has changed significantly.  These images contain wealth of information which if analysed properly, may derive useful knowledge and assist physicians for diagnosis and prognosis of severe diseases.

Many cancer related deaths are reported in the world mainly because of Brain tumours which can be diagnosed early using CT scan brain images. But as per survey, during regular screening by radiologists, 10 to 30 % tumour cells are missed. So, many Computer Aided Diagnosis systems are proposed to improve efficiency of screening and to give second opinion to physician about abnormalities which could be missed during screening [2].

Research has been carried out to diagnose from medical images using techniques like Classification, Association Rule Mining, Clustering or combination of algorithms.

They mainly suffer either because of lower classification accuracy or memory constraint to process large set of medical images. So, parallel algorithms which can process large set images as well as algorithms which give higher classification accuracy are required.

Proposed Hybrid approach discusses parallel implementation of FP-Growth Association Rule Mining algorithm with J48 Classification which gives reasonably acceptable classification accuracy. Various classifiers are compared with J48 classifier based on accuracy and experimental results have shown convincing results.

Section II discusses contribution of researchers? in medical diagnosis using various techniques and approaches. Section III discusses performance issues in techniques presented by researchers. Method for medical diagnosis is proposed in section IV. Various classification algorithms are tested in Section V followed by discussion and future scope of method in section VI and VII.



II. LITERATURE REVIEW AND RELATED WORK   P. Rajendran, M. Madheswaran [1,2] proposed a method that deals with the detection of brain tumour in the CT scan brain images using Novel Fuzzy Association Rule Mining (NFARM). The pre-processing technique applied on the images eliminates the inconsistent data from the CT scan brain images. Then feature extraction process is applied to extract the features from the brain images. A Novel Fuzzy Association Rule Mining (NFARM) applied on the image transaction database which contains the features that are extracted from the CT scan brain images. A new test image has been tested with the mined (NFARM) rules. The proposed NFARM gives the diagnosis keywords to physicians for making a better diagnosis system. The experimental results of the proposed method gives better performance compared to the traditional Fuzzy Apriori algorithm.

Xiaolei Tan, Haiwei Pan, Qilong Han and Jun Ni [3] proposed method based on region of interest (ROI) extracted from the medical images and Diff_FP-growth algorithm. Paper firstly clusters the region of interest (ROI) extracted from the medical images and marks these images using these clustered ROI. Then presented Diff_FP-growth algorithm with the guidance of medical domain knowledge on these preprocessed medical image dataset to find those association patterns.

P. Rajendran, M.Madheswaran [4] proposed a method concerned with the classification of brain tumour in the CT scan brain images using canny edge detection technique for feature extraction, frequent pattern tree (FP-Tree) and   DOI 10.1109/CICN.2012.134       decision tree methods. The major steps involved in the system are: pre-processing, feature extraction, association rule mining and hybrid classifier. The pre-processing step has been done using the median filtering process and edge features have been extracted using canny edge detection technique. The frequent patterns from the CT scan images are generated by frequent pattern tree (FP-Tree) algorithm that mines the association rules. The decision tree method has been used to classify the medical images for diagnosis.

The hybrid method improves the efficiency of the proposed method than the traditional image mining methods. The experimental result on prediagnosed database of brain images showed 97% sensitivity and 95% accuracy respectively. The physicians can make use of this accurate decision tree classification phase for classifying the brain images into normal, benign and malignant for effective medical diagnosis.

Dr. DSVGK Kaladhar, B. Chandana [5] presented various classification techniques like CART, LMT, Random Forest, ADT, Na?ve Bayesian and Bayesian Logistic Regression for Cancer Datasets. The class imbalance is one of the problems in the present statistical research. Enough evidence to support the claim of this problem can be provided by data mining and machine learning approaches. The data has been explored from UCI Machine learning repository and weka version 3.2 has been used as tool in the present research. Breast cancer, Embryonal Tumour on central nervous system, Leukamia, lung cancer and Lymphoma datasets provided good results with random forest method. Various attributes such as cell size, bare nucleoli, cell shape, clump thickness, marginal adhersion, genes 1637x, 1731x, 1062x, 3950x, and 3328x has shown association with cancer.

A. Zemirline, L. Lecornu, B. Solaiman, and A. Ech- cherif [6] presented multi rule classifier and compared with other associative classifier algorithms like CBA, PART, and RIPPER. They propose a new Association Rule Mining algorithm for Classification (ARMC).  Algorithm extracts the set of rules, specific to each class, using a fuzzy approach to select the items and does not require the user to provide thresholds. ARMC is experimentally evaluated and compared to state of the art classification algorithms, namely CBA, PART and RIPPER. Results of experiments on standard UCI benchmarks show that proposed algorithm outperforms the above mentioned approaches in terms of mean accuracy.

Milan Kumari, Sunila Godara [7] presented comparative studies of classification methods for Cardiovascular Disease Prediction. In this research paper data mining classification techniques RIPPER classifier, Decision Tree, Artificial neural networks(ANNs), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are analysed on cardiovascular disease dataset. Performance of these techniques is compared through sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, error rate, True Positive Rate and False Positive Rate. Analysis shows that out of these four classification models SVM predicts cardiovascular disease with least error rate and highest accuracy.

Aswini Kumar Mohanty, Saroj Kumar Lenka [8] applied image mining in the domain such as breast mammograms to classify and detect the cancerous tissue. A hybrid approach of feature selection using fast branch and bound algorithm and hybrid genetic algorithms are used.

Mammogram image can be classified into normal, benign and malignant class. Total of 24 features including histogram intensity features and GLCM features are extracted from mammogram images. A hybrid approach of feature selection is proposed which approximately reduces 75% of the features and new decision tree is used for classification. Experiments have been taken for a data set of 300 images taken from MIAS of different types with the aim of improving the accuracy by generating minimum no.

of rules to cover more patterns.

R. Aggrawal and R Srikant [9] presented fast algorithms for mining association rules using hybrid algorithm called AprioriHybrid.  They have considered the problem of discovering association rules between items in a large database of sales transactions and presented two new algorithms for solving this problem that are fundamentally different from the known algorithms. Empirical evaluation shows that these algorithms outperform the known algorithms by factors ranging from three for small problems to more than  order of magnitude for large problems. Paper shows how the best features of the two proposed algorithms can be combined into a hybrid algorithm, called AprioriHybrid. Scale-up experiments show that AprioriHybrid scales linearly with the number of transactions. AprioriHybrid also has excellent scale-up properties with respect to the transaction size and the number of items in the database.

Adepele Olukunle and Sylvanus Ehikioya[10] proposed a Fast Algorithm for Mining Association Rules in Medical Image Data using Partitioned FP-Growth Algorithm which improves efficiency. Authors have presented various image mining techniques in medical domain and presented efficient Partitioned FP-Growth Algorithm.

Zhenghao Shi, and Lifeng He [15] reviews the application of artificial neural networks in medical image preprocessing, in medical image object detection and recognition. Main advantages and drawbacks of artificial neural networks have been discussed. By this survey, the paper try to answer what the major strengths and weakness of applying neural networks for medical image processing would be.  The training of a neural network is a time cost work and also medical image processing tasks often require quite complex computation.

Ordonez and Omiecinski [17] used the partitioned Apriori-based algorithm  to mine simple geometrical shapes. Their choice of algorithm was influenced by the algorithms of fast implementation on large data sets. Their work indicates that image mining is feasible using the ARM approach and simple rules can be obtained from a few simple objects. However, the candidate item sets generated limit the amount of memory occupied by discovered associations.

Bram van Ginneken*, Bart M. ter Haar Romeny, and Max A. Viergever [18] presented a survey on Computer- Aided Diagnosis in Chest Radiography. The traditional chest radiograph is still ubiquitous in clinical practice, and will likely remain so for quite some time. Yet, its interpretation is notoriously difficult. This explains the continued interest in computer-aided diagnosis for chest radiography. The purpose of this survey is to categorize and briefly review the literature on computer analysis of chest images, which comprises over 150 papers published in the last 30 years. Remaining challenges are indicated and some directions for future research are given.

WYNNE HSU, MONG LI LEE, JI ZHANG [19] shows that Image mining is more than just an extension of data mining to image domain. It is an interdisciplinary endeavour that draws upon expertise in computer vision, image processing, image retrieval, data mining, machine learning, database, and artificial intelligence. Paper examines the research issues in image mining, current developments in image mining, particularly, image mining frameworks, state-of-the-art techniques and system.

Authors also identify some future research directions for image mining.



III. ISSUES IN EXISTING METHODS  As per literature review, Medical images are diagnosed and classified to detect interesting patterns based on various algorithms like association rule mining, classification and other algorithms.

Problems with existing Association Rule Mining algorithms:  A. Apriori, Association Rule mining algorithm generates larger number of Candidate sets and also requires more number of database scans.[11]. The candidate item sets generated in partitioned apriori (improved apriori) limits the amount of memory occupied by discovered associations [17].

B. CARMA (Continuous Association Rule Mining Algorithm) (Hidber, 1999) brings the computation of frequent itemsets online. This is a 2-pass algorithm offering features for dynamically generating and removing candidates after each tuple of the database is processed. It was shown by Hidber(1999) that while CARMA did not perform consistently better than Apriori, its memory utilization was less by an order of magnitude[11]. It also generates large number of Candidate sets.

C. DIC algorithm (Brin et al., 1997) also known as non- level wise algorithm is a multi-pass algorithm. It suffers from the drawbacks of tuple-by-tuple approach.

This algorithm is considered as a closer to the sampling approach proposed by Toivonen(1996)[11].

Performance of Dynamic Itemset Counting (DIC) is heavily dependent on the actual distribution of data in database [12].

D. Sampling Approach and DIC suffers from tuple-by- tuple approach, redundant work by reading each transaction repeatedly [11].

E. Apriori, CARMA, DIC, Sampling Approach algorithms follow Breadth First Search approach which is less efficient than Depth First Search.

Problems with existing Classification algorithms:  A. Artificial Neural Networks can be used only for numerical data, usually normalized within the range 0 to 1 and is difficult to interpret. Multilayer Perceptron might over fit the training unless the measures like cross validation are used wisely. Also the time taken to construct Mulitlayer Perceptron is very high .The data required to train Neural Network is high compared to all other algorithms [13].

Neural network is hard to express human expert?s knowledge and experience, and the construction of its topological structure lacks of theoretical methods. All these can make the image processing method by neural networks unstable. For achieving a high and reliable performance for non-training cases, a large number of training cases are commonly required .If an ANN is trained with only a small number of cases, the generalization ability will be lower  [15].

B. Support Vector Machines doesn?t support categorical attributes and must be converted into real numbers [13]. As per experiments carried out by Efstathios Kirkos, Charalambos Spathis and Yannis Manolopoulos[13],  Decision Trees outperforms Back- propagation Neural Networks and the Support Vector Machines.

C. Ripper (Repeated Incremental Pruning To Produce Error Reduction) takes more processing time to derive rules.

D. As per experiments carried out by ARIHITO et al. [20] using algorithms Logistic Regression , Decision Trees (J48), DT with naive Bayes, Artificial Neural Network, Naive Bayes, Bayes Net and Decision Trees (ID3) for prediction of Breast Cancer, Decision Trees (J48) outperforms all algorithms in Sensitivity and gives better accuracy compared to other algorithms except Logistic Regression.



IV. SUGGESTED METHOD  Mining medical images involves many processes. The process to be used depends on the type and complexity of image to be mined.

A novel and unique approach of Hybrid classification (Parallel FP [Frequent Pattern]-Growth algorithm for association rule Mining followed by J48 Decision Tree Classification) of medical images is proposed which outperforms above mentioned algorithms in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

(1) Data Pre-processing: ? Data normalization, data preparation, data  transformation, data cleaning, and data formatting are done in data pre-processing. Normalization techniques are required to integrate different image formats to a common format.

? Segmentation is done to identify Regions Of Interest (ROI) for the mining task, usually achieved using any image processing techniques like adaptive water immersion algorithm, Canny Edge detection algorithm.

(2) Feature Extraction:  ? Relevant information as the Features is extracted for each Region of Interest (ROI).

? Features like (1) the gray level of ROI (2) ROI area (3) the location of ROI (4) the extension degree of ROI (5) the direction of ROI (6) the symmetry of ROI are used for clustering ROI using any clustering algorithm.

? Prepare transaction database based on clustered ROI.

Apply association rule mining on transaction database using FP-tree to find strong rules.

FIGURE 1 -  Suggested Method  (3) Frequent Pattern Mining and rule generation: (Parallel FP-Growth algorithm)  Algorithm 1. (FP-tree construction) Input: a transaction DB and a minimum support threshold  Output: Its frequent pattern tree, FP-tree  (a) Scan the transaction database DB once to  identify set L1 and then rearrange L1 in descending order of support count.

(b) Grow a tree with an empty root node(null).

During the second scan, starting from the null root node, add paths to the tree corresponding to the reordered transactions, updating the node?s count.

(c) Transactions that share common ancestor nodes, use the existing nodes in the tree and update the node?s count suitably. If common ancestor not available, add new nodes from root node and repeat.

Algorithm 2. (FP-growth)  Input: a FP-tree constructed with the above mentioned algorithm; D ? transaction database; s ? minimum support threshold.

Output: The complete set of frequent patterns.

(a) For every element, locate positions in the tree  where the nodes appear in the tree and list the paths as the conditional pattern base, with the considered element treated as a common suffix.

(b) From each of the conditional pattern bases, determine the cumulative frequent pattern tree counts.

(c) Finally, mine the frequent patterns by suffixing L1?s element with the frequent pattern tree values obtained in the earlier step.

Algorithm 3. (Parallel FP Growth algorithm)  (a) Let ai be a frequent item in a transaction database, DB. The ai -projected database for ai is derived from DB by collecting all the transactions containing ai and removing from them (1) infrequent items, (2) all frequent items after ai in the list of frequent items, and (3) ai itself. [14]  (b) Construct ai-conditional FP-tree on the ai- projected database based on the FP-tree construction algorithm.

(c) Call the FP-growth algorithm, mine the frequent items from FP-Tree constructed in previous step and obtain interesting patterns.

(4)  Interpretation of patterns and knowledge extraction:  (J48 Decision Tree Classifier)  Result of Association Rule Mining can be given to J48 Decision Tree Classifier to classify images based on the rules generated.

Algorithm:  (a) Create a node in the tree.

(b) If all records or sample in the training database belong to the same class label C, then a leaf node is created with label C and terminated.

(c) If attribute value list is empty, create a leaf node labelled with majority class label and terminate.

(d) Determine the test attribute based on the attribute selection measure rank.

(e) For every value of the chosen attribute or based on n-ary model, add a tree branch with the test condition specified.

(f) Assume s is the number of records in the training database which satisfies the test condition.

(g) If s is empty, then create a leaf node labelled with the majority class label.

(h) Else, grow the decision tree inductively.

VI. DISCUSSION  Experiments in Table 1 and Table 2 are carried out in WEKA using standard datasets from UCI machine learning repository and real Cancer dataset of LYMPHOMA and LEUKEMIA from Bio-Informatics Research group respectively. In Table 1 smaller dataset is used with instances around 300 to 500 and attributes around 10 to 40. In Table 2 larger dataset is used with 4026 attributes and 96 instances in Lymphoma dataset and 7129 attributes and 34 instances in Leukaemia dataset. As per experimental results in Table 1, majority of classifiers have performed well for smaller dataset and it is difficult to predict best classifier while in Table 2, J48 has performed well in terms of classification accuracy for large dataset of Lymphoma. But BayesNet, Naivebayes and Multilayer Perceptron (ANN) are failed because of huge memory requirement to process and more time required building training model. However, they performed extremely well for smaller datasets.



VII. FUTURE SCOPE OF THE PRESENTED METHODS  Medical images have a large number of attributes, therefore, the space of rules generated is usually very large and techniques for handling the data are generally I/O, Processor and memory intensive.

Important properties of an efficient algorithm for mining medical image data are [10]:  1. A fast algorithm, which will efficiently search the  huge space for large item sets, with minimal consideration for small item sets.

Traversing of data structure is faster in FP- growth algorithm compared to other mentioned algorithms.

2. It is important that the algorithm has an efficient itemset counting strategy due to the large number of images (transactions) involved. FP-growth-like algorithms count the database once and use a compact tree structure (usually much smaller than the original database) in terms of frequent pattern to represent the large items.

Size of Candidate item-sets is reduced because of Depth First Search approach.

3. It is desired that we scan the transaction database the minimum number of times possible (an efficient I/O structure). Algorithms that implement efficient pruning of small itemsets, achieve minimal scanning of the transaction database. FP- Growth algorithm fulfils this requirement.

4. An algorithm that can represent long patterns in a complete and compact way is necessary.

Completeness implies that it should never break the pattern of any transaction, while compactness implies reduction of irrelevant information. FP- growth algorithm represents the entire set of transactions and patterns in compact and complete way in a tree-like form, which eliminates the need to generate candidate item sets [14].

5. An algorithm, which is scalable to parallel implementation, is desired. Serial algorithms are constrained by the memory and processor power limitations of a single processor. For large databases, such as image data sets, the transaction database or the candidate item sets can be partitioned and run on several processors, which work independently. This approach can provide for faster implementations and the ability to handle higher computational complexity.

Parallel FP-Growth algorithm is scalable and amenable to parallel and distributed implementations. Because of parallel implementation of FP tree, height of tree is reduced and partitions can be handled separately and efficiently [14].

6. An efficient algorithm which correctly classifies images is essential requirement. Hybrid approach of FP-tree with Decision Tree Classifier improves efficiency compared to traditional image mining methods [4].

Advantages of J48 Decision Tree Classifier:  1. Simple flow chart like structure which is easy to understand.

2. Supports Categorical as well as discrete values of attributes.

3. J48 Decision Tree Classifier gives reasonably good classification accuracy in comparison with other classification algorithms listed above based on survey [20] and experimental results.



VIII. CONCLUSION  Image mining in the field of medical diagnosis has tremendous research opportunities because of complexity and expertise required. Many authors have proposed algorithms and methods for Detection of brain tumour in the CT scan brain images, Cardiovascular Disease Prediction, Classifying and detecting cancerous tissue from breast mammograms, Diagnosis in Chest Radiography and many more medical applications which shows research in this direction may help society and mankind.

Proposed method consisting of unique combination of two powerful algorithms Parallel FP Growth for association rule mining and J48 Decision Tree classifier for classification is expected to diagnose medical images accurately, efficiently and in user friendly way because J48 Decision Tree represents results which can be easily interpreted with utmost accuracy as per the experimental results tested on UCI dataset in WEKA. Also Parallel FP growth algorithm divides tree in parts and reduces height of the tree, doesn?t generate candidate item sets, increases efficiency and reduces I/O overhead.
