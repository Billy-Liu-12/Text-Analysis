Abstract?Distributed Space Missions (DSMs) are gaining  momentum in their application to Earth science missions  owing to their ability to increase observation sampling in  spatial, spectral, temporal and angular dimensions. Past  literature from academia and industry have proposed and  evaluated many cost models for spacecraft as well as  methods for quantifying risk. However, there have been few  comprehensive studies quantifying the cost for multiple  spacecraft, for small satellites and the cost risk for the  operations phase of the project which needs to be budgeted  for when designing and building efficient architectures. This  paper identifies the three critical problems with the  applicability of current cost and risk models to distributed  small satellite missions and uses data-based modeling to  suggest changes that can be made in some of them to  improve applicability. Learning curve parameters to make  multiple copies of the same unit, technological complexity  based costing and COTS enabled small satellite costing have  been studied and insights provided.
