I. INTRODUCTION February 4, 2009 the State Council executive meeting  examined and approved in principle the equipment manufacturing industry restructuring and rejuvenation program. The "high-speed rail, urban rail transit" project a top ten light industries in focus.

Advanced orbit traffic equipment manufacturing production is a synthesized and complicated big production activity, which need bulkiness and high content technology. Its quality control primarily indicate that how to insure the project to reach the need [1, 2], which include the quality layout, quality pledge and quality control. Quality control management system can analysis, state and access the build project, which will reduce the manpower model on a certain extent and disentangles the management form fussy data processing.



II. QUALITY MANAGEMENT STUDY ACTUALITY Foreign countries have the system theory and practice  method and deeply study on different management method.

Quality control and management is the import factor in  insuring the advanced orbit traffic equipment manufacturing project quality, which impenetrate its whole project course [3].

Grafting information technology onto advanced orbit traffic equipment manufacturing can make the transition from industry society to information society at society economy base, structure, productivity and production relation.

Meanwhile, it can make the industrial structure to upgrade and update and urge the style of economic increase urge to change from extensive condition to intensive condition. Furthermore, it can urge core business of enterprise production [4, 5], operation and service etc. to realize informati zation.

Grafting information technology onto advanced orbit traffic equipment manufacturing can be divided into three phase: partial amalgamation, basis amalgamation and complete amalgamation for grafting information technology(IT) onto enterprise at side of stratagem, operation, technology, equipment and resource, which were shown in Fig.1. This paper only discusses the use of information technology in advanced orbit traffic equipment manufacturing quality management.

Figure 1. amalgamation phase model  Production unit should take aberrance coefficient of inspecting quality target as the estimate target [6]. They should build allowed limited value for every construction quality target aberrance coefficient. In the advanced orbit traffic equipment manufacturing production, the production quality database should be built and input the production quality checked result into database at any moment. On the base of this, production quality was assessed and quality was tracked.

Basis amalgamation  Complete amalgamation  IT  Enterprise Technology, equipment, Stratagem, operation,  Resource Partial amalgamation     Quality management and control has the characteristic of huge information quantity, better integration, complex management factor and strict disposal method [7]. But existing advanced orbit traffic equipment manufacturing company quality control yet settle in manpower disposing phase and use the original and behindhand management method.

Now, our country has less quality management system software for advanced orbit traffic equipment manufacturing company production management system. Meanwhile, the original and behindhand management method can not realize the real dynamic quality management.

In order to insure the advanced orbit traffic equipment manufacturing company production quality and improve the management work efficiency, the consummate advanced orbit traffic equipment manufacturing company production quality control management system should be developed based on the system project and whole quality management theory realizing the information management on advanced orbit traffic equipment manufacturing company production.



III. QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM DESIGN The three aim of advanced orbit traffic equipment  manufacturing company production management is investment, quality and rate of progress. But, the quality management is the most import task in three aims. Modern quality management is whole orientation quality management emphasizing dynamic control, whole orientation thought, and much knowledge application, especially the computer assistant system application.

Through the computer assistant system application, advanced orbit traffic equipment manufacturing company production quality control was better executed. Meanwhile, the engineering quality was better and timing analyzed and appraised through up growth network and formidable computer technology, which offers the cogent decision-making for the railroad engineering building management. The differences among the construction plan log, inspecting log and data collection log were duly discovered. Then, the reasons were discovered. Thus, the needed sound and image datum were duly draw-out right knowing the engineering whole circulation situation and improving the level of advanced orbit traffic equipment manufacturing company production management.

In order to solve the memory  collection and query problem in advanced orbit traffic equipment manufacturing company production for the manager to know the project build quality data and have assistant right decision-making, a quality management system should be developed by using network technology, computer technology and management theory, visual laying out advanced orbit traffic equipment manufacturing company production quality, realizing the fast query and state function.

This system use the B/S structure adapting the ?lean client and fat server? development current, which is convenience for system maintenance and spread, shown in Fig.2. The system directly meets the internet, so the user can login the system by using the network IE browser at any place. Construction,  inspecting and data gather manager can finish the data writing and maintenance.

Submit data  database  Figure 2. system network structure  According to the system design and demand analysis, the system should reach below aim: The dynamic management and control should be realized for the advanced orbit traffic equipment manufacturing company production quality by using the information technology.

Collection, store, deal with, protract figure and print table by using the locale check data of advanced orbit traffic equipment manufacturing company production.

Analysis, plot and count the locale check data by using quality management tools.

Stat and analysis the locale check data through time, a section of a highway, construction unit and inspecting unit.

Access data should be deal with and memory for advanced orbit traffic equipment manufacturing company production quality.

According to function partition, this system has 8 parts in below, shown in Fig.3.

Taking quality analysis management model as example, amount stat. method is the effective method in whole quality management. The subsystem control the construction quality by using amount stat. method including frank square chart, control chart, arrange chart and correlation chart, through which the system can finish the data input, analysis, account, construct and print output etc.. This will give the effective quality information.

A. Power Management This model can enroll the user by role and popedom. For  example, the advanced orbit traffic equipment manufacturing company production unit user can but vindicate their own unit data and have no power to vindicate other unit data. The system manager can grant other user?s power etc.

B. Subproject Management This model can insert, modify, delete and query sub-project  etc. work.  For example, it can append the subject?s sub- project.

C. Quality Access Management Quality access is an import base for management decision.

This subsystem strictly executes the standard according to ?railroad engineering quality checking up standard?. This system can automatically accessed the quality and gather the quality stat. and access result.

Figure 3. model function structure  D. Construction Log Management Construction unit can insert, modify, delete and query the  construction log by using this model. Meanwhile, they can upload and save the important production sound and image datum, which is convenience to be lookup and report.



IV. LOCALE PRODUCTION QUALITY TRACK ASSISTANT MANAGEMENT  A. Redirector Project Locale Construction Quality Track Assistant Management For the redirector of locale construction mass scout  assistant management, it is import to supervise and urge assistant locale construction collect data, store, deal with, and plot and report forms, which is uploaded network. Locale check data is calculated, plot and analysis by using quality management tools.  For example, redirector project quality check access is the access in the construction course and after production done with.  First, subentry project and subsection project should be accessed. Then, the project quality should be accessed after the production done with.

B. Bodywork Project Locale Construction Quality Track Assistant Management Giving priority to defend is an import principle, which  should analyze the infection factor of the subentry project quality and delete the bad factor. Each tache and working procedure in production should be strictly, system and roundly supervised and managed from the complete game of the bodywork project. In order to control the quality and construction activity for the inspector, a science and logical quality management procedure should be established to instruct the engineering construction and inspection. Quality control is the emphases in the advanced orbit traffic equipment  manufacturing company production including: checking the concealment project, go on a tour of inspection for project quality, taking out and check project material and check the pledge system etc.

C. Locale Construction Quality Track Assistant Management First side should assign technology personnel to the  advanced orbit traffic equipment manufacturing company production unit to instruct and supervise correspond personnel to put in the observation data and log. Meanwhile, the import production sound and image should be uploading and save.

First side should engage some professional people to give some accomplish quality analysis, input data, plotting and print table work so that the effective quality information for the project quality control.



V. IMPORTTANT INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY  A. Selected  Server Hardware Flat Roof Because of the big processing data, in order to insure the  high stability, security and expansibility, good high capability server and disk array system have been used, such as IBM, server and SAN disk array etc.

B. Server Software Flat Roof Oracle8i database and Windows 2003 Server is used. Data  layer use oracle database system to effectively store and management the plan data and model data. Logic layer use the JAVA, JSP technology to deal with the data flow answer for project quality logic realization, such as store and show figure data. Application layer realize the quality data application.

C. Data mining design First, the web surrogate server extracted and switched data  through extracted switched monitored system from other system and sent the integrated data to partial database with metadata. Then, the quality management system decided the quality through OLAP and data mining system by processing completed multi-dimension data and partial multi-dimension and sent these data to browsers by web application sever. The data mining framework is shown in Fig.4.

1) Extracted Data Extracted data is to organize, trim the data in database and offer the data to other system according to certain form demand.

Extracted data has two methods: the one is extracting tools, the other is to write program. The extracting tools have weak security and adaptability. They need to connect with the operation system and data warehouse. In addition, the extracting tools were hardly competent for their work when the extracting process had complex calculation and transition. But the extracting tools can reduce our work and increase extracting effect. In the other hand, to write program had good security and adaptability, but it would increase our work and depress the extracting effect.

The operation system characteristic of advanced orbit traffic equipment manufacturing engineering build is very complex. It had a lot of data fountain and complex hardware  Advanced orbit traffic equipment manufacturing company production quality  management system  Pow er  m anagem  ent  Subproject m  anagem ent  C onstruction log m  anagem ent  Stakeout log m  anagem ent  First delegate data m  anagem ent  C ollection data m  anagem ent  Q uality analysis m  anagem ent  Q uality access  m anagem  ent    environment and operation system plat roof. It is just in this sense, we adopted the PL/SQL program to extract the data from the database and organize them according to certain form.

Increment extracting and complete extracting combined to extract the data from the database. Increment extracting is used to the data with time prickle. The complete extracting and bestrow method is used to extract the data without time prickle if the data number is not large. Otherwise, modified and new data was judged according to the systematic log information, and then the method of increment extracting is used.

2) Cleaned out and switched data The extracted data must be cleaning out and switching so that they can be validly load into data warehouse. The reason is that the operation is independent and different criterion, but the extracted data in data warehouse must be integrated and accordant.

There are dirty data in extracted data because the operation systems of advanced orbit traffic equipment manufacturing company production face different operation and the program form criterion are disunion. The dirty data are as following:  a) The format went out of line: The data types have potential mistakes.

b) The consult integration went out of line: The data cannot find the consult.

c) The cross system went out of line: The same data existed in several operation systems, but they weren?t matching.

d) The inside coherence went out of line: The same note repeatedly appeared in the same table, most situations are that some fields had nuance. The fashion of writing PL/SQL program was adopted to clean out switch the data because of many data fountain. Modifying and standardizing the repeated data, dealing with the exception and making up the half-baked data were adopted to above problem.

3) Loaded and updated data: The fashion of writing PL/SQL program was adopted to load data into data warehouse. Corresponding index was made according to referring custom and data structure and number in order to increase the referring speed.

a) First loaded data: First loading data can defined that all the operation data including history data were first time extracted to center database from the operation database when the centre database was built up. Manual fashion was adopted because of the large number of data in the first loading data.

Daily maintenance can be divided into batch maintenance and increment maintenance.

b) Batch maintenance: Expert maintenance tools and manual maintenance can be used in batch maintenance. It is divided into three steps: uninstalling data from the operation database, formatting the switched data and loading data.

c) Increment maintenance: Only the changed data were extracted every time after the first extracted data in increment maintenance. Meanwhile, the unchanged data were not extracted again. As a result, the communication and  maintenance quantity decreased greatly. So the automatic maintenance was adopted in common increment maintenance.

4) Algorithm:We give quality comparability algorithm example. The function is comparing all kinds of quality information in appointed a period of time.

Practical application indicates that this system has better application foreground and it?s robust and validity, which has society and economic value.
