Application of Web-based Data Mining in  Personalized Online Recruiting System

Abstract?Online recruiting methods become an important part in the recruitment system. However, the lack of personal service in a web environment is one of development bottlenecks of online recruiting system. First, this paper analyzes single online candidate?s personal requirements. According to their requirements, a personalized recommendation system framework is proposed based on the technology of web usage mining. The system provides individual recommendations in accordance with the analysis of single job seeker?s searching custom and interest, so the quality of service could be improved. Then, this paper researches on two key algorithms: maximum forward path (MFP) mining algorithm and association rules mining algorithm, and implements the programming of the two algorithms in the proceed of web-based data preprocessing and mining .Finally, the result of the test indicates that the system designed in this paper is feasible.

I.  INTRODUCTION Online recruiting websites tends to provide dozens of job  opportunities; however,  each candidate is often only interested in one position or several positions. Thus lots of information on the website is useless to single job seeker. How to find job- seekers? interests, and bring the convenience and enlightenment for them in a web environment, is discussed in this paper.

The job seekers leave many web access log files which reflect their searching customs and interests. In order to obtain single job seeker?s searching custom and interest, this paper presents a personalized recommendation system based on web log mining .It?s to find not only single job seeker?s frequent sequential paths that he had visited in the past, but also associated positions and pages that he might hadn?t visited before. Thus different people could enjoy different recommendations in the improved online job searching environment.



II. WEB USAGE MINING TECHNOLOGY Web mining is the intelligent analysis of Web data [1].Web  usage mining is the process which extracts "interested" patterns from the web data. The web data includes web server access log, proxy server log, browser log, user registration  information, and users? session .In this paper we mainly use web log as data source, so we use the concept of web log mining instead of web usage mining .The process of web log mining is as follows:  A. Data Preprocessing Data preprocessing or data preparation is the first stage of  web log mining. The raw data is converted into the data with which pattern discovery could deal. It includes data cleaning, user recognition, session recognition, path supplement, transaction recognition and so on. Web log data preprocessing has a direct impact on the correctness of models and pattern rules which are discovered in the next stage.

B. Patterns Discovery In this stage, using various methods, we attempt to find  models and pattern rules of users? access behavior. Common technology is as follows: sequential patterns, association rules, clustering, and classification and so on.

This paper chooses two applications of sequential patters and association rules.

C. Pattern Analysis In most cases, web usage mining can find all the modals  and rules. Pattern analysis is used to extract valuable interesting patterns from all these models and rules.



III. ONLINE JOB SERCHING PERSONALIZED RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM FRAMEWOK  This paper presents such a model: with the mining technology and analysis of web logs or other records, the system could find job seekers? interests and habits. While an old job seekers is visiting the website, the system will automatically match with the active session and recommend the most relevant hyperlinks what he interests. The model is shown in figure 1.

Figure 1.  personalized service model.

A. System Requirements Analysis As a typical service system whose function is providing  information and knowledge, the requirements of online job searching personalized recommender system are as follows:  1) Job seeker?s frequent paths recommendation: Pattern mining engine system provides finding single users frequent paths, and adding hyperlinks to his pages. In other words, system can automatically identify each user?s frequently sequential pages and store them .When the job seeker visit the web site next time, hyperlinks of those pages will be added so that he could directly link to his individual pages being remembered.

2) Relevant pages recommendation: In addition to single user?s own frequent access paths recommendation, the system also recommends relevant pages that are visited by other job seekers. That is to say, those who have partly visited the same pages may have similar interests. The recommended pages serve for every job seeker as suggestions. Moreover, it is important enlightenments and suggestions.

B. system framework design To achieve those individual requirements mentioned above,  web log mining and personalized recommendation model are integrated and designed as follows:  1) Data preprocessing module: corresponding to the data preprocessing process of log data.

2) Data mining module: in the module, the difficulty is how to deal different issues with different algorithm. Frequent sequential paths mining algorithm and Apriori algorithm for association rules mining will be implemented in this paper, to achieve requirements of personalized service.

3) Real-time intelligent recommendation module: it is the only online processing module; moreover, it?s an adapter between job seekers and system.

The following figure shows the architecture of personalized recommendation system.

IV. WEB LOG MINING ALGORITHMS This paper researches two algorithms: frequent se path  mining algorithm for MFP mining and Apriori algorithm for associations rules mining.

A.   Frequent Sequential Path Mining Algorithm Frequent paths mining of single user is one example of  sequential patterns. The job seekers? frequent path which can mostly reflect their interests is a sequence of pages browsed during a certain period of time. Providing personalized service according to one?s interests, the users? frequently access path mining is of great importance obviously. In the frequent paths mining algorithm, input is a set of transaction recognition: MFP set. Output is a set of user?s frequent paths and the corresponding support rate. Based on these conclusions the system could find the job seekers? interest modes. Relevant definitions and concepts are as follows.

Definition 1  Let P={ 1? ? 2? ? ? ? n? }be a page sequence, and P is called a frequent page sequence or frequent access patterns if P meets the condition:  min100|| }|{ S  WTS TPT ??? ?  (1) Where T is a web transaction; minS  (0< minS <1) is a minimal support rate threshold specified by user; WTS is a web transaction set.

Definition 2  A page sequence of length ?n? is also called an n-sequence.

Construct kFP  in order to mine users? k-length frequent access path. The main idea of this algorithm is based on the concept of candidate paths set. Find a candidate path whose length is k from MFP set, and then calculate its support rate in all the single user?s sessions. The M largest support of paths set is mkFP . .

Web log data  Extract "interested" patterns  Real-time information recommendation  Job seekers    Construct kFP  Algorithm: Input: a job seeker?s MFP set: iF Output: a job seeker?s frequent access path set: kFP  (k>  l) For every iF  {  For each{ 1? ? 2? ??? n? }in iF { If (k ? m){  For (j =1; j< m ?k + l; j + +) { if{ j? ??? 1-kj+? }  in kFP  support of{ j? ??? 1-kj+? } +1 else if support of{ j? ??? 2-kj+? }? 1?ks And  support of { 1j+? ??? 1-kj+? }? 1?ks Insert{ j? ??? 1-kj+? }in to kFP ;  } }}}  Before call the above algorithm, calculate support of every page whose length is 1 in the session. Then from 2 to k call this algorithm cyclically, and each cycle uses the results of the last cycle supports.

B.  the classic apriori for association rules mining For the exploration of the association rules, many  researchers usually use the classic Apriori algorithm. Some research articles have shown that the association rules of a relational database can provide a useful method for mining knowledge on different application areas (Liao and Chen, 2004). At the beginning, the classic Apriori algorithm is designed to find hidden associations from a massive of market records. To put relevant goods adjacently is beneficial to sales.

Similarly, to put relevant pages or positions together on job searching websites could be beneficial to users. In a web job searching environment, association analysis is to find the relationship among different positions and information provided by the website. This paper uses the Apriori algorithm as a methodology of association rules for data mining.

The process of Apriori algorithm is based upon transaction database, so the original web log should be converted to transaction database. The web page-viewed model presented in this paper is as follows:  T= {  1t ,  2t  ,?  ,  mt  }                                                      (2)  it  = < tid?uid , ip  >, ip  = < i1p , i2p  ,? , ikp  >         (3) Where T is a web page-viewed transaction database;  it consists of three parts: tid stands for a transaction?uid stands for a user, and ip  stands for different pages the user browsed. So this model records all pages which are visited by the users.

Then the converted transaction sets tend to be analyzed and mined by Apriori algorithm. Reference [4] shows the process of Apriori algorithm.



V. EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSES Based on the researches above, an experimental system is  designed to testify its application .The procedure of the web log mining system runs on windows 2003 server operating system platform, using Visual C++ programming language.

A. experimental system design The system consists of two modules: data preprocessing  module and mode mining module. The data preprocessing module includes the processes of data clearing, user identification, session identification and transaction identification. The structure is as shown in figure 3.

Figure 4.  Experimental system interface.

B. the testing result Select a web server log files as the test data, including more  than 850 records from Sep 2, 2006 to Sep 8, 2006. The following figure shows some of the original web log:      Figure 5.  Original web log.

1) analysis of association rules mining: In order to improve the accuracy and reduce the amount of calculation, use the first session of a job seeker as a source of data mining, and choose the four-length mining frequent paths algorithm. Thus set path length=4. A given example of the results is as follows:  TABLE I.  SINGLE JOB SEEKER?S SEQUENCE PATHS.

ID User ID Frequent-URL Support  1    4 P2 P12 P16 P18 2  2    4 P1 P2 P9 P15 4    The result shows: in the first session of job seeker4, considering path length is four, the numbers of sequential paths are {P2 P12 P16 P18=2, P1 P2 P9 P15=4}. In other words, the path ?P2-> P12 ->P16-> P18? is visited 2 times; the path?P1-> P2 ->P9-> P15? is visited 4 times.

Based on these results, the job seeker is more interested in the content of P1-> P2 ->P9-> P15.Thus the hyperlink of P15 can be recommended to him directly when he just enters. For example, if a job seeker is found to be interested in the position of sales, while he is browsing the home page, the URL ?/ position / sales /? which he frequently visited is shown on his own page directly.

2) analysis of association rules mining: Set min- support=10% and min-confidence=15%.An example of the rules from frequent sets is given below:            TABLE II.  ASSOCIATION RULES BASED ON APRIORI ALGORITHM.

ID Association rules Confidence Recommended pages  1 P2 P9=> P15 20% P15  2 P2 P9=> P6  17% P6  3 P2 P9=> P8 16% P8   According to the three association rules, if a job seeker  has visited P2 and P10, the hyperlinks of {P15 P6 P8} would be recommended to him. For example, if a job seeker has browsed not only /IT but also /IT/ systems programmer he will be potentially interest in the contents of {?/IT/ systems engineer?,?/user/register?, ?/forum/programmers?} .Thus these hyperlinks are added to in the user?s own page as enlightenments and suggestions.



VI.  CONCLUSIONS The testing results above indicate that the personalized  recommendation system could find the job seekers? customs and interests. Due to the convenience and enlightenment for online job seekers, the personal services are achieved to a great extent.

Web mining technology will be widely studied in the domains of intelligent information retrieval system, e- commerce and e-government etc., for it?s a good choice for intelligence and personalization system. However, both in theory and in practice, there are still some problems in web usage mining. In future we will research on such directions: to accurately identify the users in an agent environment, to effectively judge session boundaries and to improve the efficiency of algorithms for web-based data mining.
