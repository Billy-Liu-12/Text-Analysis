Analysis of Dominant Factors in Chinese Power

AbstractThe development of power system in developing  countries can be affected by a great many parameters, hence it is  necessary to identify the dominant factors, which are the most  influential and typical.  In this paper, 27 different variables were  selected from statistics across China covering the period 1978-  2008. By applying recently developed data mining techniques,  interesting relationship between electricity consumption and  influencing factors were obtained. Finally, four dominant factors  as well as five sub-dominant factors were declared based on the  confidence value of association rules.

I.  INTRODUCTION  Along with the economic development and the  improvement of living standard, the electric power demand in  China has steadily increased since the late 1970s. To acquire  advance knowledge of electrical load becomes essential for the  utilities, in order to expand generation, transmission and  distribution systems accordingly. Long term power growth is  influenced by many direct or indirect factors, such as economic  indices, population, industrial composition and social policy, et  al. It is therefore important to identify key variables which are  the most typical and influential in electricity consumption.

In the past three decades, great efforts have been made on  the relationship discovery between energy or electricity  consumption and economic growth, started with the original  work by Kraft in 1978[1], in which causality was found  running from Gross National Product (GNP) to energy  consumption in the United States. Subsequently, similar  investigations were conducted on other industrial countries like    the United Kingdom, European Union countries, Canada and  Japan [2-5], using co-integration and error-correction modeling  techniques. Empirical studies have been later extended to cover  Asian and developing countries as well in order to facilitate the  implementation of a proper energy policy [6-10]. A  comprehensive research can be found in [8], in which the two-  step procedure in a panel-based error correction model was  employed and evidence of close connection was gathered  between energy consumption and Gross Domestic Product  (GDP) for a panel of 18 different developing countries during  the 1975-2001 period.

In particular, after the adoption of reform and opening-up  policy, foreign capital, technology, and joint ventures were  encouraged by the Chinese government to promote the  countrys modernization. The energy and electricity  consumption experienced rapid increase consequently. Hence,  in recent years, the growth law of electric load in China and its  relevant factors has drawn extensive attention [11-15].

The factors analyzed in most of the aforementioned work  were confined to economic indices, especially GDP and  income. From historical data, however, despite the remarkable  growth in Chinese electric power industry, the speed did not  keep up to pace with the countrys economic growth, which  means the rate of power growth was not a direct one-to-one  correlation with the growth in GDP[11]. In other words, the  electricity demand is affected by various factors besides GDP  or Per Capita GDP. Therefore, to search for key factors from  all kinds of energy-related parameters becomes a difficult but  challenging issue. In this paper, 27 different indices including  economic indicators, population, peoples livelihood, price  indices and weather conditions of Chinas 31 provinces,  autonomous regions and municipalities (excluding Taiwan,  Hong Kong and Macao Special Administrative Regions), in the  period 1978-2008, are selected as candidate factors for  association analysis with power growth.

Data mining, whose objective is to obtain hidden  knowledge from data stored in large repositories, is recognized  as a powerful tool in many areas. Association rules, one of the  best studied models for data mining, can provide  implications that relates to the presence of items in data sets.

Considering in many cases, real-world relations and hence data  patterns, are intrinsically ambiguous (fuzzy) rather than precise    (crisp), the concept of fuzzy sets was thus introduced into  association rules analysis[16]. The main contribution of our  study is to pool together the data of individual provinces and  municipalities under similar economic system across China,  and reveal general rules of which factors display closer  relations with power consumption. Our paper differs from  previous work by applying the new data mining technique to  extract meaningful rules from historical data. A novel  perspective is proposed for better understanding the growth law  of power load in China.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the  basic concepts of membership function and fuzzy association  rules. Section 3 illustrates which indices are selected and how  978-1-4244-5874-5/10/$26.00 2010 IEEE  to preprocess data with different dimension. Section 4 shows  the empirical results on association degree of electricity  consumption and relevant factors, and finally, section 5 draws  the conclusion.



II. METHODOLOGY  A. Association Rules  Let I be a set of items and T a set of transactions with items  in I, both assumed to be finite. An association rule is an  implication of the form X Y? that relates to the presence of  itemsets (sets of items) X and Y in transactions of T,  where ,X Y I? , ,X Y ? ?  and X Y = ?? . This expression  indicates that if X occurs then Y is likely to occur. The  probability that Y occurs, given that X has occurred, is called  the confidence of the rule. The probability that both X and Y  occur is called the support of the rule [17]:  ( , ) ( )Supp X Y T Prob X Y? = ?  (1)    ( , )( , ) ( | )  ( , )  Supp X Y TConf X Y T Prob Y X  Supp X T  ?? = =  (2)  Association rules with support and confidence greater than  some user-specified threshold are called strong rules. Thus,  classical association rule mining algorithms aim to extract  these interesting associations from database. Fig.1 describes a  typical algorithm for mining association rules using  pseudocode. Some definitions relevant to the algorithm are    shown as follows:  Definition 1: An itemset is an ordered set of terms  1 2{ , ,..., }nt t t such that ia jat t?  if i j? .

Definition 2: An i-itemset is an itemset 1 2{ , ,..., }nt t t  where n i= .

Definition 3: An itemset is called a large itemset (L-itemset)  if its support is equal to or greater than a threshold minimum  support (min_supp).

B. Membership Function and Fuzzy Association Rules  From a classical (crisp) perspective, an association rule  X Y?  is generally interpreted as if X occurs, then Y. For  example, the rule if Age is Young, then Salary is Low  associates a set of ages with a range of salaries. These sets may  be defined by crisp sets, but more natural interpretations of  young and low would suggest an ambiguous interpretation.

Hence, the concept of fuzzy attributes determined by  membership function was introduced to correlation degree  evaluation.

Fig.2 illustrates how to use fuzzy sets to describe an item  with domain [0, 1] using the terms Low, Medium and High as  specified by their respective membership functions. Fuzzy  membership functions indicate degrees of membership for each  category or term. More specifically, a variable value of a1, as  shown in Fig.2, belongs 100% to the Low category, and a value  of a2 belongs 70% to Medium and 30% to High.

Membership function  Following this strategy, fuzzy association rules are still  expressed in the form X Y? , but in this case, crisp operations  in the measure of X and Y are replaced by a T-norm and  cardinality with a scalar-cardinality in (1) and (2) [18]. The  simplest extension of cardinality to fuzzy sets is the sum of the  membership values of the elements in a fuzzy set:      ( ), ( ))  ( )    ( )  n  ik jk  k  n  ik  k  T X Y  f Conf X Y  X  ? ?

(3)  where T is a T-norm [18], ? is the membership function to  determine fuzzy attribute values described in Fig.2, and the  sum is taken over the set of elements in the database. The  confidence for fuzzy associations is then adopted as the  quantitive indicator of association degree in the following  research.



III. DATA SELECTION AND PROCESSING  Annual data of 31 provinces, autonomous regions and  municipalities, covering the period 1978-2008 were  investigated in this study. Statistics of Taiwan, Hong Kong and  Macao Special Administrative Regions are excluded because  these regions enjoyed different economic policies during this  period. As depicted in Fig.3, 27 factors representing variation  tendency of economic, population, price, trade, weather, and  peoples life, et al, obtained from Statistical Yearbook of  individual regions, Power Yearbook of China and  Meteorological Yearbook of China, were selected for  associative analysis with power growth.

Table 2 summarizes  the pre-treating process. Fig.4 to 6 describe the growth  tendency of electricity consumption as well as some candidate  variables of a municipality. Sustained increase can be found  from every curve during the period 1978-2008.

IV. EMPIRICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  The main process of mining fuzzy association rules can be  divided into four steps: First, the candidate factors are  standardized and then transformed into fuzzy attributes by  using the membership functions. Second, large fuzzy patterns  are generated from the database by applying particular  algorithm depicted in Fig.1. Then, Based on the large fuzzy  patterns, the desired fuzzy association rules with the minimum  confidence (min_conf = 0.5) are extracted. Represented by the  value of confidence, the quantitative association degrees  between electricity consumption and its influencing factors are  finally achieved. Table 2 shows the empirical results. The  conclusion on dominant factors identification is displayed as  well.

A 0.520    The analytical result shows a heavy dependence of  electricity consumption, and hence the power load growth, on  industrial output value and per capita GDP.

Total value of imports and exports, income, non-  agricultural population and total investment in fixed assets are  found out as the sub-dominant factors to growth in electricity.

Weather conditions in summer influence peak load level, along  with the proliferation of air conditioning load. Peak summer  temperature is thus found relevant to some extent as well. The  remaining 18 candidate variables, therefore, are suggested to be  ignored in power load analysis and forecast.



V. CONCLUSION  In this paper, we have introduced a new data mining  methodology to investigate association degrees between  Chinese power load growth and 27 different candidate factors.

This methodology offers some advantages as, for example,  allowing us to properly extract interesting association rules  from large historical database. By ordering confidence of  selected rules, four dominant factors and five sub-dominant  factors boosting the electricity consumption in China are  identified, which can been adopted for better understanding the  growth law and more accurately predicting the electricity  demand.

Future work includes the development of a new prediction    method for electricity demand using the dominant variables  identified in this research as inputs. Furthermore, other data  mining techniques, such as clustering analysis, are also being  considered.
