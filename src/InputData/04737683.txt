1. Introduction  Coal mining in our country has very important significance, although many coal mines of our country have been equipped with the monitoring system for safety production, but because the industry has a very high risk, the production process of coal mine accidents occur from time to time. Analysis the reasons, it is very important is that the ground monitoring system can not be timely and accurate grasp the important data of underground of coal mine. It is difficult to achieve the perfect effect of regulation on underground operations failed to detect irregularities, causing accidents.

In the process of the underground monitoring system establishment, it may be result the spark phenomenon during data transmission if use cable, because of cable possible exposed in the air and it is easy to cause a gas explosion. While cable transmission system can not be changed in time for new sites for data collection, the blind spots will be existence, and the equipment maintenance costs are very high. The traditional wireless networks need to establish a fixed base stations and with the continuous deepening of the mine, the communication lines do not change flexible.

The wireless network established base on Ad hoc installed convenient, flexible and the system is easy expansion. Data collection and transmission of gas concentration, the pressure of wall mine and the air humidity of the monitoring system of underground is study and design.

2. System structure  Ad hoc network is a kind of autonomous, self-organized multi-hop wireless network. The entire network without a fixed infrastructure[1] have not fixed router and all the nodes are mobile And it can in any way to maintain the dynamic linkages with other nodes, each node can be considered as a router and they will be able to complete discovery and keep the routing functions with other nodes. The sensor networks which communicate by wired or the wireless network is a group of sensors by Ad hoc. The sensor network purpose is to sense and collect the information of the sensed object which is geographic area coverage by networks and transmission the information to observer[2]. According to the actual needs in coal mine   DOI 10.1109/ICIII.2008.87     the design of the system combine Ad hoc networks and wireless sensor networks to complete acquisition data.

The system is designed to complete data acquisition  by the combination fixed nodes and mobile nodes. This system can possess flexibility and improving the robustness compare with other networks. System of the fixed nodes distribution mine channel and the mobile nodes are installed on the machines or persons.

The working process of system as shown in Figure 1, when the mobile nodes (such as M# node) acquisition the data of gas concentration and air humidity, they transmit the data through other mobile nodes (such as N# node) to the fixed nodes (such as W# node) if the distance between the mobile nodes and the fixed nodes beyond the scope. Finally the data is transmitted to control computer on ground along the fixed nodes installed on mine channel. The main control computer process and transmit data to remote local area network through the wire if it is necessary, convenient for the relevant departments of government monitoring many mines in the same time.

The fixed nodes sense the soil pressure in the same time transmission other signal to detecting loosening soil of the channel to prevent collapse.

By comparing the transmitted data with the database, if computer on ground detection the gas concentration, soil pressure or air humidity exceeded the standard, which will produce a warning signal and the alarm can also be transmitted to the Underground.

In the same time the worker will immediately take corresponding measures.

3. Design and implementation of physical layer  Physical layer completed connections of hardware and establishment channels of transmission data.

Because the mobile nodes of system can carry the energy is limited, it is important to consider the selection of lower energy consumption device[3]. The hardware design of sensor nodes is shown in Figure 2.

Sensor nodes include power, sensing components,  embedded processors, memory, communications components and software. Power provide the necessary energy for the sensor nodes; The sensor access outside information and convert it into digital signal; The processing components responsible for coordinating all parts of nodes , such as processing and  preservation the information of signal-sensing part accessing and control the work mode of power; Communications components responsible for communications with other sensors nodes or observers ; Software provide the necessary software support, such as embedded operating systems, embedded database system and so on.

The system cost performance has been considered before the hardware design. The choice communications components have lower power consumption and strong signal transmission capability.

According to the number of data acquisition nodes of mine underground, the time of sending per frame interval was confirmed before the nodes getting the data of gas concentration and air humidity. If data is repetition or remaining basically unchanged, it can avoid congestion and reduce the power consumption by reducing transmittal redundancy data. At the same time the communications components should also have sleep mode which could decrease energy consumption when no sending data by controlling them in a dormant state. Micro control unit ?MCU? should possess lower power consumption and has function of capture and compare, timer, and enough memory space to meet the need of embedded systems and MCU can be sleep at the interval time of data sent to cutting power consumption.

Design and implementation of MAC  Data link layer accomplish access shared wireless channel and control logical link layer, and establish a reliable point-to-point or point-to-multipoint communication links[4]. Data link layer is composed of MAC (medium access control?layer and LLC (logic link control) layer. MAC layer link up the physical layer and the network layer and accomplish detecting the channel.

In sensor networks, many data link layer control protocols were researched and simulated in present, such as SMACS, SMAC, TDMA / FDMA [5], and so on, but some of these protocols lack considering power consumption problems, and some tend to consider only point-to-point communications. The MAC layer protocol of the system is implemented by improving CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access /Collision Avoid). Data link layer flow chart is given in the figure 3.

The first by considered is that the number of underground sensor nodes before using the protocol,  and setting the nodes cyclical carrier sense project in fixed time interval to save power consumption, and control the time of data transmitted in channel to avoiding obstruction caused by much data.

5. Design and implementation of network layer  Creating and maintenance routing are main work of network layer. In sensor networks the routing protocol is divided into planar type and hierarchical type[6]. But mostly routing protocol established connections between the nodes and the easily mobile sink nodes by the multi-hop form. In Ad hoc network, the existing multi-hop routing protocol, such as AODV[6] (Ad-hoc demand distance vector) and TORA (temporally ordered routing algorithm) and DSR[7] (dynamic source routing)are not suitable for the characteristics and requirements of sensor networks in general. The most nodes of the sensor networks don?t move rapidly like the nodes of Ad hoc network. There is no need to pay a high price for frequently updating routing tables? information.

This system adopted Estrin D and other people's directed diffusion routing policy[8] which specifically designed for the wireless sensor networks and it has a completely different implementation from the presented routing algorithm. The data of this system nodes generated were named by a set of attribute value.

A variable called "gradient" is connected with the process of diffusing that the entire requested work course and it reflects that the intermediate network nodes approximate judgment of matching request conditions data source. A more direct approach is that nodes represent its choice with a set of scalar values.

The greater possibility of acquisition matched data is that continued to searching in this direction. This will finally establish a temporary "gradient" field for sink request in the entire network, and the matched data may reply to sink nodes along the direction of the steepest"gradient ".

6. Conclusion  1. The processing unit of the wireless sensor nodes has a certain computational ability and can complete some information-processing work, for example, processing the sensor export signal in simple. However, because of the capacity and processing of the embedded processor and memory is limited, the sensor?s computational ability is limited to the nodes is a smaller number.

2. The number of wireless sensors can be extended  in accordance with actual needs, but still there is defect in maintenance of the more network nodes.

3. The networks dynamic character is not very strong and it can follow the changed transmission path which brought by the new added nodes and the inactive network nodes. But when the data stream is tremendous, every node possession only a limited computing resource in wireless sensor networks, it is difficult to processing real-time data stream in a massive amount and this may cause the blocking network, and even meltdown.

In addition, it is necessary to fully consider energy consumption of all aspects before design. All hardware circuits adopted low power consumption and the agreement is simplified as much as possible and frame structure is short.
