FRAMEWORK FOR MULTI-PURPOSE WEB LOG ACCESS ANALYZER

Abstract-In spite of being provided the abundant raw data from World Wide Web (WWW), it is difficult to make any sense out of such massive data without data mining techniques.

In this paper, we emphasize on the mining of web access logs, web usage data. Our propose framework is composed of five steps. The first step is defining the purposes that our multi- purpose analyzer can provide. In second step, we define the ontology mapping based on Web Sites defined in the previous step. After that, we perform preprocessing step base on our web log access data as the fundamental requirements of the proposed framework. Web usage based mining based on frequent item sets and our proposed algorithms are the core step of the system. In the final step, Na?ve Bayesian classifier is applied to predict for the future depending on the current analysis outcomes. Our system is intended to provide for Web Site Maintainers, Web Site Developers, Personalization Systems, Pre-fetched Systems, Recommender Systems and Web Site Analysts, etc.

Keywords: web access log, ontology mapping, preprocessing

I. INTRODUCTION  Web usage mining refers to the automatic discovery and analysis of patterns in clickstream. It also collects or generates data as a result of user interaction with web resources on one or more Web sites. Capturing, modeling and analyzing the behavioral patterns and profile of user interactions with Web site are its main goal [1]. The expansion of freely available data for user access has resulted in increasing number of Web mining research.

Several data mining methods are used to discover the hidden information in the Web. However, there is no system that can support for all or most of the web usage mining fields. Majority of the web mining systems are likely to be specified into the particular problem domain. On the other hand, web mining does not only mean applying data mining techniques to the data stored in the Web.

Our approach is to mine the access of the internet in an efficient way. The system mines web log records to discover user access patterns of Web pages. The analysis of regularities in the web log records can identify potential  customer, enhance quality of services and web server performance.

The contribution of our proposed system is to discover interesting user navigation patterns but also to be applied to many real world problems, such as to improve Web sites/search engine usage, to make additional topics or product recommendation to attract more users, study and analysis of users? behavior from multiple points of view.



II. RELATED WORK  The [2] deals with the problem of visualizing multidimensional data, especially focusing on data obtained from the web access logs. This paper describes the visualization of four dimensions: the day type (Working day, Saturday, Sunday), the two hour interval which contains the time of visit, the site and the number of page downloads. This paper uses four simple and powerful techniques and shows their application with real web log data.

The difference between [2] and our proposed system is that our system proposed our own procedures to act as a multi-purpose web log access analyzer. The former wants to support Web content to obtain precise information about the visits on their site in order to improve their services. The main purpose of our proposed system is to improve the Web Sites facilities, to persuade more users, to know the statistical information, to maintain the Web Sites, and to modify the Web Sites? structure if necessary.

The paper [3] proposed that the query logs from Web search engines are important cultural artifacts that should be preserved. These logs will become even more valuable as historical archives as the Web log expands into the geographically areas and economically diverse segments of the population. There are commerce and privacy consideration that must be addressed; however, there are significant possible benefits in having access to these historical records.

The results of the Web query log analysis [4] may be shifted depending on the fraction of agents (non-human clients), which are not excluded form the log. They proposed a method based on the sliding window technique:     a threshold is assigned to the whole observation period.

Besides, they determine the sub-optimal values of the parameters of the method: a window size and a threshold and recommend 5-7 unique queries as an upper bound of the threshold for 1-hour sliding window.

The paper [5] estimate instrumental limits of an unexacting comparison of results reported in different Web log studies. They consider sensitivity of results of log analysis to controllable factors: a log sampling technique, an observation period and two cut-off variables peculiar to the Web log analysis. Our proposed system is difference from [5] is that our system is only based on the training Web log data and our proposed procedure.

The [6] proposed a faceted classification scheme for web queries. This scheme consists of four facets of ambiguity, authority sensitivity, temporal sensitivity and spatial sensitivity. The contribution of this work is to propose a classification scheme that is specially tied to actionable strategies that search engine can take when a query is classified. The difference from our approach is that their approach is to extend to use of simple data to construct and replicate manual classification queries.



III. STEP BY STEP PROCESSING OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM  This section describes the details of the operation and performance of our proposed multi-purpose analyzer.

A. Defining Purposes  The sample purposes that our system can analyze are: ? Education purpose ? Entertainment purpose ? Commercial purpose ? Searching purpose ? News purpose  B. Defining Ontological Mapping  Our sample mapping ontology is based on Web Sites defined in the first step. For example, definition of ontological mapping for education purpose is  Education  .edu         .org ?           .gov   ?.     IEEE  ?..  ?  ?  ? We identify that all .edu are education purpose Web  Sites.

C. Preprocessing of Web Access Log Data  In this step, we remove parts of the original web log data that are not relevant in our mining process. After that we get the web log data as 192.168.0.161 7/3/2008/12:00:05 http:// www.google.com/  ? 192.168.0.161 is the IP address (client) that can be used to mind personal usage and the result can be applied in Personalized Systems, Recommender Systems and Pre-fetched System.

? 7/3/2008 12:00:05 is the date time data that is intended to support the Web Site Maintainers, .Web Site Developers and Web Site Analyzer to know the most usage and the least usage date time.

? http://www.google.com/ is the domain name. Our analyzer is to know which IP frequently uses which sites for which purposes.

D. Web Usage based Mining  ? Mining Specific Site ? to support for Web Site Maintainers, Web Site Developers and Web Site Analysts (Statisticians).

? Mining Specific Client ? to know the clients? frequent usage behavior, site and purposes. This mining result can be especially applied in Personalized Systems.

? Mining Specific Purpose ? Our system can analyze the most usage site for a particular purpose. From the Web Site Maintainers? and Web Site Developers? point of view, they can prepare to attract more and more clients for their sites.

? Mining Specific Day ? to report which day is the peak usage day of the week. The result is most suitable for Web Site Analysts to view the statistics of web usage data. Web Site Developers and Maintainers can prepare/modified their Web Site structure to persuade more and more clients.

? Mining Frequent Item Set ? Discovering, extracting and comparing the clients? usage, percentage of different search engines? usage, usage rate among date , day etc.

E. Prediction  In our framework, Na?ve Bayesian classifier [7,8] is applied to predict the future usage of individual users (for Personalized Systems), specific site (especially for Web Site Maintainers and Developers), specific purposes (also useful for Recommender Systems and Pre-fetched Systems), etc.



IV. PROPOSED SYSTEM  With the increasing popularity of the Web, it is no surprise that Web mining has attracted lots of attentions.

Web usage mining has been an important technology for understanding user?s behaviors on the Web.

The main purpose of our proposed framework is to apply the system in many ways such as for Web Site Maintainers, Web Analyzers, Pre-fetched Systems, Web Personalized Systems and Recommender Systems. Our proposed analyzer is based on the real web access logs so the results can provide for practical use. Web usage mining finds patterns in Web server logs. In our system, IP address refers to a specific client.

To fulfill our purposes, we propose our own procedures that may be useful for various domain areas.

Procedure 1:  PPR. Mining Specific Client?s Usage Input: Database D of transactions, Specific IP address Output: Sites (S) used by individual user Method  1. Accept input_IP (Specific IP Address) 2. for (int i=0; i<= D.size; i++) 3.  if (input_IP = = D_IP) 4. extract sites from database 5. return S  Figure 1. Procedure 1 for multi-purpose Web Log Access Analyzer  This procedure may be useful for Web Personalized Systems, Pre-fetched Systems and Recommender System.

For the Web Site Maintainers, they should know the users? interest rate on their sites. Depending on the users? interest rate decreasing or increasing through the time, they can modify their site structure to attract more users from the aspect of economic benefits. On the other hand, the statistician can view from the analysis perspective. We proposed the procedure AM especially for maintainers and developers as a result of Web usage over a specific period of time.

Procedure 2:  AM1.Find the users? daily usage Input: Database D of transactions, Specific Date for  Web Sites usage Output: total number of users in one day 1. Method 2.

Procedure 2 for multi-purpose web log access analyzer  Procedure 3:  AM2. Find the multi-users Web Site usage upon a specific period  Input: Database D of transactions, start_date and end_date to count the total number of usage during a specific period  Output: total number of users for a particular period Method  1. Accept start_date and end_date 2. count = 0; temp [ ] = null; 3. while (D_date>= start_date &&  D_date<= end_date) 4.   if (temp [ ] = = null) 5.                temp[ ] = D_IP 6.                count ++ 7.          else 8.                 while (temp [ ]) 9.                         if(temp [ ] = = D_IP) 10.                                  do nothing 11.              else   temp[ ]= D_IP 12.                        count ++ 13.   return count         // total number of internet users  for a specific period  Figure 3. Procedure 3 for multi_purpose web log analyzer  We proposed the procedure 4 intends to provide especially for Web Site Maintainers and Web Site Analyzers. Web Site Maintainers can know users? interest rate on their site. So they can the ways to attract more and more customers and maintain the potential users.

V. IMPLEMENTATION RESULTS  In this paper, we study the web log data from real Web sites and show the experimental results. To show the  frequent usage patterns for dynamic contents Website, we study a number of websites. In our proposed framework, we firstly task the web log access based on our training data.

So, the implementation results may vary and depend on the amount of sample training data. We proposed the our system with 300,000 training data records of 30MB shows the analysis results with figures.

Figure 9 shows the most usage IPs among clients.

Figure 9. Sample of the most individual (personal) usage  The results of least usage IPs among clients is illustrated in figure 10.

Figure 10. Sample of the least individual (personal) usage  Figure 11 represents the analysis result of comparison of Web site usage upon training data set.

VI. FUTURE WORK  This is very first step of our research work therefore our proposed system may have weak points. Despite these shortcomings, we believe that our analyzer is a step forward in multi-purpose web log access analyzer. Our ongoing work is to predict the future usage upon our analyzer?s results using Na?ve Bayesian Classifier.



VII. CONCLUSION  Our proposed framework for Web Usage Analyzer is intended to apply in many ways such as for Web  Site Maintainers, Web Analyzers, Pre-fetched Systems, Web Personalized Systems and Recommender Systems because we are mining based on user?s purposes, date, and site of web log data then presents the results upon different dimensions. It can also be used in statistical analysis of the information about most often used web sites to inform the particular clients and can be used in Pre-fetched system.
