Abstract-In financial system, the general use of financial data has also been unable to meet the inherent need of the deepening of financial information and management modernization. The financial informationization is faced with needs of the growing use of financial data analysis. Under this background, this paper analyzes the financial income of certain city in a certain period.

Association rules are mined in Weka by using apriori algorithm to those data, which have be collected, preprocessed and converted. By finding the rules and knowledge, it can provide a scientific basis for decision-making and gain valuable information for comprehensive analysis and evaluate the financial balance of payments situation in certain region.

I. INTRODUCTION  In recent years, information construction of financial system in China has been developed greatly. Especially with performing Golden-Finance Project, financial management in formations in some financial department have become completely. The amounts of financial business become more and more, and those of data storage have also grow rapidly [1].

Now finance, tax, exchequer and bank are all on-line, which can supply amount of distributed data for analyzing financial information and making decision. But now these data were wasted for only be utilized in inquiring some daily business.

Forecasting financial revenue is an important work to financial department, which can affect financial plan [6]. Now some financial departments make out of plan with base multiply by the expected growth rate. This approach ignores the various economic factors on the tax revenue directly or indirectly affect, and no monthly prediction, so the lack of adequate scientific.

To scientific making financial decision, financial system needs analyze some data changes by using association rules. How to mining association rules to financial revenue will be very important [7].

Putting data mining to predict financial tax-revenue and analyzing association rules of related data through the history of saving can identify all relevant factors on the tax-revenue impact. By setting up financial revenue prediction model of the month and year earnings forecast, financial revenue plan can be   Rui ZHANG College of Computer Science & Information Engineering  Zhejiang Gongshang University Hangzhou, China  zhangrui@mail.zjgsu.edu.cn  made with a scientific and effective guidance, and improve the tax plan for the accuracy and timeliness. Simultaneously, the financial department can understand the income and ensure that the revenue of the job carried out smoothly [5].



II. LITERATURE REVIEW  A. The necessity ofDM  Data Mining (DM) is an iterative process within which progress is defined by discovery, either through automatic or manual methods. DM is most useful in an exploratory analysis scenario in which there are no predetermined notions about what will constitute an "interesting" outcome. The application of Data Mining techniques for revenue analyzing is a fertile research area. Now only few developed countries have also used Data Mining in finance revenue analyzing successfully.

For example, the USA has used Data Mining techniques in levies taxes and management software in 2002, which can Guarantee the authenticity of the information and reduce taxes evasion successfully. In Australia's taxes department, managing tax-revenue by using computer system, controlling tax fund in virtue of data warehouse and data mining, carrying out tax audit and revenue forecast pointed. After running for six years, Return on Invested Capital(ROIC) of system has reached 1:250[8].

In recent years, research on the application of DM techniques for the purpose of management financial revenue has been emerging in China. In 2003, national tax authorities of Guangdong province put forward financial analyzing and decision support system for constructing financial information.

In the same year, regional tax authorities ofNanjing city started out data warehouse project for resolving some operation requirements. As a whole, application data mining in financial system is in a preliminary situation in China, how to audit and forecast financial revenue will be attention focus of financial system [9].

In recent years, with the development of information technology, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, a new field of intelligent data analysis, data mining, began to appear and grow rapidly in the embarrassing background of abundant data and poor knowledge. It also brings a new livingness for  PACIIA 2009    the deep research of the method for financial analyzing [2]. On the basis of large database or data warehouse which stores a great number of listed companies' financial data, data mining technique can dynamically mine out valuable hidden knowledge, which can be applied to predict listed companies' financial distress.

B. DMprocess  Data mining is the process of mining hidden and valuable knowledge from database, data warehouse and other information storage media. It has several functions such as association analysis, classification and prediction, clustering analysis, outlier analysis and so on. Each of them may have several alternative data mining algorithms. Data mining aiming at revenue prediction belongs to the problem of classification and prediction, whose typical data mining methods consist of decision tree classifier, Bayesian classifier, and neural networks classifier [13].

Data mining for financial revenue analyzing needs five steps: selecting data from original database, data preprocessing, data conversion, extract associate rules, and analyzing data and assimilated knowledge [10].

? Selecting data from original database: means drawing relevant data from data source such as CYFD.

Attributes of the data set may include financial measures attributes, class attribute, and other essential informati on attributes.

? Data preprocessing: consists of discrimination of continuous-values attributes, data generalization, and attribute relativity analysis, elimination of outliers, and so on.

? Data conversion: transform data to analyzing model.

Building a proper analyzing model is the key to success ofmining.

? Mining associate rules: mining some conversion data and finding association rules by some mining tool, for example Weka.

Analyzing data and assimilated knowledge: evaluate some mining results in proper standard and use some knowledge after evaluating into some real information system to help making decisions.



III. ASSOCIATION RULES  A. Definition ofassociation rules  Association is the discovery of association relationships or correlation among a set of items. They are often expressed in the rule form showing attribute-value conditions that occur frequently together in a given set of data. Association analysis is widely used in transaction data analysis for direct marketing, catalog design, and other business decision making process [3][14]  Substantial research has been performed recently on association analysis with efficient algorithms proposed, including the level-wise Apriori search, mining multiple-level, multi-dimension associations, mining associations for numerical, categorical, and interval data [4][11].

Association rule mining can be defined formally as follows [12]:  Attribute set: I == {iI' i2 , ??? , im }  Attribute item: ij , j == 1,2, ...m  Deal database: D == {t1 , t2"'.1n} t k ?k == 1,2,...,n is called a transaction, where each  transaction t has a t - itemset ,that  is tk == Jtk ,tk ,??.1k } c I .~ I 2 11 Assume I == {iI' i2 , ??? , im } is an attribute set, then  X => Y is called a rule.

If X c I, Y c I , and X n Y == ? 0 Its means that if  the transaction containing item set X, and also tend to containing set Y .

The confidence of rule X => Y is named c, if supp(XuY) .

------ == c, Which sup p(X u Y) represent the  sup p(X) support of the rule X u Y , that is the transaction database D include all transaction number of item set X u Y sup p(X) represent the support of item set X . '  supp(XuY) If IDI = S , then the support of rule  X=> Yis s.

Which IDI represent the transaction number in transaction  database D , if D == {t1 , t2 , ? ? ? , tn } ,then IDI == n .

If minimal support is S . , minimal confidence is C .min mm >  then association rule is the rule X => Y , with support sand confidence c contends:  (1) s~Smin;  (2) c ~ Cmin.

In what follows, Ck represent all candidate set of item k ,  Lk represent all Large item sets ofk .



IV. REVENUE ANALYSIS BASED ON ASSOCIATION RULES  A. Data collection  There are three forms in the government revenue, including Regular tax revenue, Regular non-tax revenue and Non- recurrent revenue bonds. There are some important quotas in the structure of revenue, including: Value added tax(VAT), Turnover tax, Corporate income tax, Personal income tax, others(including of city maintenance construction tax, house tax, stamp tax), Administrative Charges, Fines and confiscations and Special Revenue. The data used in this study was obtained from Database (CYFD), which including 72 months of the city revenue from 2002.1 to 2007.12. For page limited, only 3 months are shown as representative at table 1.

TABLE 1. ORIGINAL DATAOFREVENUE  Month 2002.1 2005.1 2007.1 Value added tax(VAT) 8.3522 14.0748 19.0421  Turnover Tax(TT) 10.8525 21.5029 32.2316 Corporate income Tax(CIT) 6.9906 12.4457 18.0796  Personal income tax(PIT) 2.6615 4.7738 7.0131 others 3.6707 7.0285 9.9152  Administrative Charges 0.7410 2.1186 2.9752 Fines and confiscations(FC) 1.5683 3.6785 5.4126  Special Revenue(SR) 2.2331 4.4015 6.8361 General Budget(GB) 44.7169 88.3900 130.8641  B. Weka  WEKA is a data mining experimental package for learning data mining algorithm and grasping the process of data mining.

WEKA contains a large number of algorithms, data pre- processing, classification, regression, clustering, association rules, data visualization tasks etc. WEKA can read documents in various formats: WEKA's ARFF, CSV, C4.5. weak file can be saved as ARFF format. Lines in ARFF document referred to as an Instance, and a vertical line known as an attribute. Such a form become data sets, relationship can be shown between attributes. The ARFF file has two distinct part. One is the head information, the other is data information.

C. Data preprocessing  ? Sum all quotas in the same time, that is L ? Accounting percentage of each quota corresponding to  L each time, that is weighting t ij ? Sum all weighting t ij of same quota, that is 8  ? Accounting the mean of S, it is 8 ? compare t ij with 8 . If t ij)8 , then t ij = 1 valid,  else t ij = 0 in vain.

? transfer all 0 to ?

Now generate the newly table. For page limited, only 6  months are shown as representative at table 2.

TABLE 2. CONVERSION TABLE  Month 2002.1 2005.1 2007.1 Value added tax(V AT) 1 ? ?

others 1 ? ?

Administrative Charges ? 1 1  Fines and confiscations(FC) ? 1 1  Special Revenue(SR) ? 1 1 General Budget(GB) ? 1 1  To operate in the Weka environment, corresponding codes need set up, that is:  @relation finacial @attribute zengzhi { 1 } @attribute yingye { 1 } @attribute qiyesuode { 1 } @attribute gerensuode { 1 } @attribute qita { 1 }   @attribute xiangzhengxing { 1 } @attribute famo { 1 } @attribute zhuangxiang { 1 } @attribute zong { 1 } @data  1?111????

And save them ARFF file, it is finacialtest.arff  D. Mining association rules  In Weka environment, select all attributes in the attribute menu and enter them on the Associate interface. Modify Apriori attributes appropriately:  IowerlsoundlvlinSupport.nl upperBoundMinSupport: 1.0 metricType:Confidence minMetric:0.9 numRules:30 Some associate rules can be obtained from above procedure  by association menu in Weka, that is: Minimum support: 0.25 (15 instances) Minimum metric <confidence>:0.9 Number of cycles performed: 15 Generated sets of large itemsets Size of set of large itemsets L (1) Size of set of large itemsets L (2) Size of set of large itemsets L (3) Size ofset of large itemsets L (4) Size of set of large itemsets L (5)  Associate output in table 3: Support value is setting as 0.1 /<:? 1, so in line with the rules  of Minimum support is 0.25. When modifying support, some associate rules output will be changed. Through training the sample for several times, when setting the minimum support of 0.25 when the correlation arising from the actual situation in line with the results.

Meanwhile, we set confidence as 0.9, so associate rules confidence output all greater than 0.9. When modifying confidence is 0.5, associate rules confidence output is between 0.5 and I.So if adding numRules, more associate rules will be generate when in accordance with the requirement of other attributes. Support and confidence value can be set according to actual requirement.



V. CONCLUSION  The results of data mining by software are not fully consistent with the actual situation. Some mining results will be going through screening, but results can be carried out for government decision-making at the macro level. For making revenue developing healthy and quickly, macroeconomic control measures will be further strengthened and improved.

(1) Maintaining the main taxes rapid growing, and raising the main taxes proportion of the total income. The growth of VAT reflects the economic situation of the region and industrial economy quality and efficiency. The growth of PIT reflects a standard of living of the people in the region.

Increasing the input of some important industries promote economic development, such as transport, real estate and automotive industries.

(2) Promoting the general growth of small tax. Property taxes, stamp duty, and administrative charges are small, but in the overall income also playa role that can not be ignored. Full advantage of the financial, property management, land resources, transportation, public security departments and other   resources to form a concerted effort, that establish standardized mechanisms, focused, strong advance tax collection and management of small work.

(3) Reducing non-tax revenue proportion of revenue, such as fines and confiscations. Improving government management of non-tax revenue collection mechanisms, efficient government non-tax revenue collection mechanisms are established.
