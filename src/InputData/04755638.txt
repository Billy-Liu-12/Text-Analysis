Virtual Communities: A Bibliometric Analysis

Abstract  Virtual communities are a popular phenomenon today. They are significantly altering the specifics of how people work, spend their free time and interact socially. Moreover, they have been receiving growing attention in the academic literature. This study aims to identify and analyze the current academic literature in virtual communities using bibliometric analysis, and thus gain insight into its related body of knowledge.

Extracting data from the ISI Web of Science, the number of yearly publications, most productive authors and countries, cross-country collaborations and the varying scientific fields dealing with the multidisciplinary concept are identified, to name a few.

Article citation and co-citation analyses are conducted to distinguish the central works in virtual community literature. Finally, deriving from these analyses, conclusions and research opportunities for further studies are discussed.

1. Introduction   The nearly ubiquitous presence of the Internet has significantly changed the mechanisms of how people spend their free time and interact socially. This is happening more and more through virtual communities, which have become a very popular phenomenon today, especially amongst the young.

Some of the most popular virtual community services on the Internet, such as MySpace, Facebook and Habbo, can hold even in the order of a hundred million registered users worldwide [45]. Furthermore, virtual communities have received growing attention in the academic literature [35].

This paper aims to identify the current state of this academic literature regarding virtual communities, and thus identify and analyze its knowledge base by using bibliometric analysis.

Where scientometrics is regarded as the measurement of scientific and technical research activity, bibliometrics is its sub-category, focusing  primarily on the quantitative study of scientific publications for statistical purposes [12]. Bibliometric methods serve the purposes of description, evaluation and scientific monitoring [25]. In previous studies, bibliometric analyses have been used to investigate, for example, the knowledge base of nanoscience and nanotechnology [13], the trends and contributions in RFID research [6], the research in venture capital [7] and industry-academia collaboration in a specific field [5]. The benefits and limitations of the methodology are discussed in the Limitations section.

This paper is structured in the following manner: In section 2 the method and data are described. It explains the search terms used for retrieving the data and tools used for analyzing it. Section 3 provides the results from the analyses, and a discussion on the limitations of the study. Finally, section 4 concludes the paper by providing a short summary of the paper and discussing viable avenues for further research.

2. Method and data   ISI (Institute for Scientific Information) Web of Science [15] was used to conduct the searches and retrieve publication data. All three available citation index databases were used in the search: Science Citation Index Expanded, Social Sciences Citation Index and Arts & Humanities Citation Index. Together these databases cover thousands of major journals across hundreds of scientific disciplines, adding up to over 40 million searchable records [15]. These citation indexes also contain a record of the references cited by the authors of the covered publications. This enables the use of cited reference searches and various citation analyses. Scientific journals indexed by ISI Web of Science databases include the most important and useful ones [23] and are thus representative of the bulk of the key scientific output [12, 24].

Searching all of the three citation index databases was done in order to get a sense of all scientific disciplines and areas contributing to the research on virtual communities. In addition, ISI Web of Science search seems to merge duplicate results when      searching from multiple indexes, so there was no great fear of redundant data in the search results.

Various naming conventions are used to describe effectively the same phenomenon, for example virtual community [29], online community [28], on-line community [4] and web-based community [1].

Therefore, the final search string was formulated as:   "web based communit*" OR "on line communit*" OR "online communit*" OR "web communit*" OR "computer mediated communit*" OR "virtual communit*"   Asterisk-characters were used to include singulars  and plurals of each search term. The search was not limited to any specific years, thus retrieving everything from 1900 to 2008. No other restrictions were applied, such as restricting the results to exclude book reviews.

All searches were performed on May 22nd, 2008.
