Abstract?This paper presents a research work on small satellite data stream and related distribution to associated stakeholders, which is a field that needs to get explored in more detail. The algorithm that is presented to extract USDDP (User-Specific Data Denominated Products) is a self managing body, which will be within as Open Space Box environment or OSBE as a novel idea.

It contains an individual stream transmitted by the small satellite, which later is to be converted into USDDP. The context defined here deals with area in detail. Contexts are vitally important because they control, influence and affect everything within them by dominating its pervasive content(s). This paper shows in depth the achievement of USDDP, which deals with a satellite?s transmitting device to the ground station?s and associated stakeholders? devices, which are to be spontaneous, readily self- manageable on autonomic basis. This paper shows an actual implementation of USDDP or can also be said as data management, which contains append and update of data received from the satellite, which later is to be used by the payload users to all related devices for further processing and storage needs. Data recharging is utilized to transmit and receive data.
