Performance Analysis of Dynamic Burst Mapping in WiMAX System

Abstract? This paper investigates the effectiveness of dynamic  resource allocation scheme in WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) system following to the WiMAX standard. Simulation experiments are performed for the case of MAC PDU (Media Access Control packet data unit) without fragmentation and numerically expanded for the fragmentation case. We used a technique called Dynamic Burst Mapping (DyPBM) to allocate the resources to mobile users, and this is then compared to other non-dynamic resource allocation techniques.  Numerical study shows that the dynamic technique (DyPBM) achieves the highest goodput increment of up to 0.7 Mbps when the MAC PDUs are fragmented.  Nevertheless, dynamic technique is less effective in the case of without MAC PDU fragmentation since it achieves low channel utilisation over the other non-dynamic techniques. This is because the available slots in some frames are insufficient to support the big PDU sizes as these PDUs (Packet Data Units) are not split into small fragments. This study thus concludes that the dynamic resource allocation is only significant when PDU fragmentation is applied in the WiMAX networks; nevertheless, there is a trade-off in terms of the complexity.

I. INTRODUCTION very wireless user undergoes different fading over time, and frequency in OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency  Division Multiple Access) networks. Assigning independent good subcarriers to a user with the best channel conditions at any time instance is found to yield significant improvements [1-2]. When the allocation is based on the users? channel qualities (i.e. dynamic resource allocation), this theoretically enhances the system goodput  due to a multiuser diversity gain [3]. At an SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) level of 15 dB, for instance, the theoretical sum capacity is 4 bits/s/Hz for a single user case, but it considerably increases to 7 bits/s/Hz when there are 16 users in the same network exploiting multiuser diversity [3].

OFDMA-based wireless technologies such as Long Term Evolution (LTE) and Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) [4] have specified that the resource allocation for a given user must be in a subchannel basis; constituting a group of subcarriers.  The standard only specifies that a minimum resource for the allocation is termed a slot (a frequency-time slot) and that the user must be allocated to contiguous slots; creating a precise rectangular shape and often known as a data region or burst in WiMAX. A frequency-time slot is defined as a subchannel over two or three number of symbols subject to the subcarrier permutation  schemes used can either be adjacent or not. The WiMAX standard only defines the uplink resource allocation as a horizontal strip-based mapping [5] and does not specify how to map the user?s data onto the downlink (DL) subframes.

Note that in this paper the terms resource allocation and burst mapping are used interchangeably.

Most DL burst mapping solutions [6-13] propose a variety of approaches to map the users? packets in the frames; several of them [9, 11,12]  consider the frame utilisation for better throughput. Only a few studies [11,12] take into account the users? subchannel conditions for the downlink burst mapping in WiMAX.  Kuei Ping et.al [11] used a Hamiltonian path to identify the best subchannels for the allocation of every user, which results in the selected subchannels not being contiguous as defined in the WiMAX standard. The authors of [11] have observed a system throughput enhancement; however this comes at the cost of high overhead due to the feedback that may actually lead to goodput fall in the networks. Hung Chang et.al [12] only discusses how to find the best subchannels adjacently without looking into detail for the case that the subchannels having different modulation and coding schemes (MCS). Our resource allocation technique in this paper only relies on subchannel feedback from the subscriber station (SS), which seems has lower complexity than that in [11].

Realistic varying subchannel conditions are also assumed, which differentiate the work here from [12]. Our work can be distinguished from [15] in terms of how the fragmentation mechanism is taken place within the frames.

Section II discusses the dynamic downlink resource allocation in WiMAX. Section III describes the simulation model, and the results and analysis of the work are presented in Section IV. This paper concludes in Section V.



II. DYNAMIC DOWNLINK RESOURCE ALLOCATION IN WIMAX The downlink burst mapping is known as a two dimensional  bin packing problem. Such a problem enquires how to pack a collection of objects (i.e. multiple burst sizes) into well- defined regions called the bins (i.e. frames). In other words, how the users can be assigned to useful time slots and subchannels of an OFDMA frame, so that the frame can be fully utilised. This class of problem is known to be NP-hard (Non Polynomial-hard) problem.

A. Dynamic Power Burst Mapping Framework The burst mapping framework is outlined as below. Given 1  and 2 as the assumptions made, steps 3 to 8 describe the DyPBM framework used.

E  2013 19th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications (APCC), Bali - Indonesia       1. Let an OFDMA DL subframe be represented as a fixed rectangular bin B characterised by a number of time slots W, a number of subchannels H and area A equal to W x H.

2. Let there be N scheduled users in the subframe, and every user k requires sk slots.

3. For every user, a minimum size of a data region (or burst) for sk slots is determined. The data region is characterised by wk,i and hk,i is located at subchannel i and has a rectangular shape where the given slots must be consecutive to each other, as illustrated in Figure 1.

4. The number of subchannels hk,i and number wk,i of the data region must be less than or equal to the total subchannels H and total time slots W on the DL subframe respectively.

5. All allocation possibilities of the user?s data region are computed in a subchannel basis.  The allocation can be started at the top (i.e. subchannel 0) to the bottom of the frame.

6. The power given by a number of slots that constitute the data region is calculated, as Figure 1 shows. This calculation must be done for all the possible data regions that can be formed for the given user.

7. The data region with the highest total power is assigned to the user if and only if the corresponding slots for the allocation are available. Otherwise, the next data region that has the highest total power is continuously searched until the available slots are found for the allocation.

8. After the above allocation is completed and if there are free slots (or unallocated slots) next to the allocated data region, as illustrated in Figure 1, the user with a burst size that can fit in these free spaces is searched. If there is no appropriate user for such allocation, leave the free spaces.

Dynamic Power Burst Mapping (DyPBM) Algorithm The DyPBM algorithm has six main steps and the pseudo-  code is presented in . The explanation of the steps is described below.

Step 1: Sort the SSs according to their mean CINRs     Let k represents the mean CINR (carrier-to-interference  and noise ratio) of user k at instantaneous time and for N scheduled users can be written as  The mean CINRs are sorted in a descending order, thus, the user with the highest CINR will be the first. The following Step 2 and Step 3 are initially performed from the user with the highest mean CINR to the user with the worst mean CINR, as summarised in . Every user executes these two steps for every subchannel consecutively starting from the top to the bottom of the frame.

TABLE 1: PSEUDO CODE FOR THE DYNAMIC POWER BURST MAPPING  (DYPBM) ALGORITHM   Step 2: Determine the burst dimension Assume that user k requires sk slots. Let subchannel i  have ti  time slots and the created burst bk,i at this subchannel is characterised by width wk,i and height hk,i.

i. Determine the temporary width wtempk,i as  wtempk,i = sk if sk? ti (2) else,  wtempk,i = ti if sk> ti (3)  e.g.

Say user 1 requires s1=10 slots and the available time slots at subchannel 1are t1 =8. Thus, the wtemp1,1 = 8.

ii. Determine the height hk,i  to compute the smallest burst dimension as  ? , = ,  (4)   e.g., Following the same example above, the height h1,1 of user 1 burst is calculated as  ? , = 8 	 = 2   iii. Determine the actual width wk,i based on hk,i  to  compute the smallest burst dimension as  k = [ 1, 2, 3, ?.., N] (1)  for every frame Step 1: Sort the SSs according to their mean CINRs  1) for (SS = max Mean CINR : min Mean CINR) for (subchannel = 1: total subchannels) Step 2: Determine the burst dimension Step 3: Calculate the total power of the burst end Step 4: Sort the power of all bursts Step 5: Assign the user to the burst with maximum power Step 6: Assign the adjacent available slots if any to another user end end  i  2013 19th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications (APCC), Bali - Indonesia       , = ? , (5)   e.g. The width w1,1 of user 1 burst is calculated as  , = 2 = 5   Thus, the smallest burst size of user 1 at subchannel 1 is  5 x 2 indicating that there are 10 allocated slots.

Step 3: Calculate the total power of the burst Assume that there are j subchannels present in the frame and every subchannel power for user k is {pk,1, pk,2, pk,3, ?,pk,j}. The power of burst bk,i is denoted as PWk,i can be computed as     , = , 	 	( , + , +1 + , +2 +?+  , +??1) (6)   where h = hk,i.

Step 4: Sort the power of all bursts Sort the power PWk,i of all possible bursts created at every subchannel i  for user k in a descending order.

Step 5: Assign the user to the burst with maximum  power Say user k has d number of possible bursts created {bk,1,  bk,2,?.bk,d} and the power of the bursts are {PWk,1, PWk,2, PWk,3,..,PWk,d}. User k is allocated to the burst that yields a maximum power, say bmaxk, given as   = max[ ,1, 	 ,2,  ,3, ? , 	 , ] (7)   Allocate the burst bmaxk to user k if the corresponding slots  of the burst are available in the frame; otherwise allocate the burst with next maximum power. Repeat this until available slots are found in the frame. This assignment here is referred to as a primary burst mapping. The illustration of the burst bmaxk allocated at subchannel offset L, with its width wk,L and height hk,L, is shown in Figure 2.

Step 6: Assign the adjacent available slots if any to another user  If there are unallocated slots available with an area size f at the right of burst bmaxk (see Figure 2), assign a user kk whose burst can fit in the corresponding area where  wkk,L x hkk,L  ?  f (8)  This type of burst mapping is called a secondary burst mapping. Supposing user 3 has the burst size bmax3 less than the corresponding size f, the user?s resource allocation can be depicted as in Figure 3.

C. DyPBM Complexity The initial step of DyPBM involves the sorting of the users? mean CINR (see Step 1) and thus the sorting problem for N users takes time O(N log N). Another type of sorting present in the algorithm is the power of all possible bursts created based on j subchannels (see Step 4). This sorting is performed for every user independently and hence yields the complexity order equivalent to N*O(j log j). The overall computation of the DyPBM algorithm approximately takes time O(N log N)+N*O(j log j).



III. SIMULATION MODEL Simulation experiments are performed in Qualnet version  4.5.1 to evaluate the effectiveness of dynamic resource allocation (i.e. DyPBM) against the other non-dynamic solutions for the WiMAX system. Other dynamic resource allocation schemes [11, 12] in WiMAX have high complexity to be implemented in Qualnet, and in fact they used different assumptions from our work. In this research, the proposed solution is benchmarked against the Largest-Burst-Size-First (represents as Large Burst) and Random-Burst techniques that have low complexity. The Largest-Burst-Size-First approach is generalised for the resource allocation techniques [8, 9] that assign the slots first to the user who has the largest burst size.

Meanwhile, the Random-Burst technique selects random users to access the resources ? this is used to compare against for the solution proposed in [11]. Both benchmarking algorithms begin the mapping from the top at the head of the DL subframe and continue to the tail of the subframe. If that particular row of slots yields insufficient allocation, then it continues to the next row horizontally.

Table 2 summarises the main system parameters used in this   Figure 2: Example of a primary burst mapping   Figure 3: Example of a secondary mapping  2013 19th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications (APCC), Bali - Indonesia       paper including the PHY and MAC layers configuration. The BS sends Constant-Bit-Rate (CBR) packets to a series of users (1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 users) in the network. The users are stationary and also uniformly distributed in a single WiMAX cell. The scenario used considers the total system load of 12.5 Mbps to remain constant across all the series of users in the network. This scenario is simulated for two different packet sizes of 160 and 184 bytes independently whereby the BS sends these CBR packets at different packet intervals, depending on the number of users present in the cell. In essence, a smaller number of users (e.g. 5 users) is configured with a shorter packet interval and will thus receive more packets than that of a larger number of users (e.g. 15 users).

All SSs receive the CBR packets from the BS only 15s after the simulation begins and the simulation lasts for 100s. Every simulation is run for four different seeds.

IV. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS Figure 4 demonstrates that the DyPBM technique achieves  marginal goodput enhancement compared to the Large Burst and Random techniques for the unfragmented MAC PDUs.

For the case of 184 bytes is able to achieve better performance than that of 160 bytes due to lower overheads. The achievable goodput performance in the burst mapping of an OFDMA frame essentially relies on the frame utilisation as well as the effectiveness of allocating the resources based on the user?s subchannel conditions [11, 12]. The DyPBM shows the highest unallocated slots as observed in Figure 5 that results to insignificant goodput enhancement. This is due to low number  of bursts that can be fitted in the free spaces (see Step 6).

Figure 5 also demonstrates that the unallocated slots percentage generally decreases with the number of users in the network for all the techniques. This trend is in agreement with [12]. When there are more users in the network, the outbound scheduler essentially has more choices in serving the users.

This results to a high number of varying burst sizes and hence small bursts sizes can be fitted in the free spaces.

The DyPBM technique averagely achieves the lowest unused slot percentage, as Figures 6 show. This is due to the fact that the proposed algorithm computes minimum sizes for burst allocation (see Step 2) and hence the smallest burst sizes are effectively created. Similarly, the Large Burst also applies a similar mechanism and thus a low percentage is also achieved, as apparent in the same figures. On the contrary, the Random technique achieves the highest unused slots percentage in both cases because it disregards the smallest burst size step for its allocation. Since all the burst mapping techniques particularly DyPBM show a substantial unallocated slot percentage, we then consider that the users? PDUs can be fragmented in order to fully utilise the frames. A result of goodput performance is numerically studied in addition to the achievable goodput obtained from the simulation experiments.

All the available slots are assigned to the given users and hence a new system goodput is computed, as Figure 7 show. It is apparent that DyPBM achieves better goodput up to 0.7 Mbps more than the other non-dynamic techniques. The reason is that considerable unallocated slots (see Figure 5) are filled up with the variable PDU fragments. The goodput performance in this downlink burst mapping technique is effectively increased due to two key factors: a) the multiuser diversity gain, and also, b) the frame utilisation, which also demonstrated in [11, 12]. The system capacity is not guaranteed to be maximised if one of the conditions is not satisfied. Table 3 shows that the dynamic scheme has the highest computation complexity compared to the other schemes in the 15 users case.

V. CONCLUSION This paper investigates how significant the WiMAX  performance enhancement when the users are dynamically assigned to resources (i.e. slots). It is observed that the dynamic technique, Dynamic Power Burst Mapping (DyPBM) achieves marginal performance compared to other non- dynamic techniques when the MAC PDU fragmentation is not employed. Nevertheless, the numerical study shows a goodput  2013 19th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications (APCC), Bali - Indonesia          Figure 4: Aggregate Goodput     Figure 5: Unallocated Slot Percentage     Figure 6: Unused Slot Percentage   Figure 7: Numerical Aggregate Goodput   increment of  up to 0.7 Mbps under the assumption of MAC PDU fragmentation is applied. This implies that the goodput enhancement in WiMAX can only be obtained due to the MAC PDU fragmentation. A trade-off in terms of the complexity of the dynamic solution is substantial compared to that of the non-dynamic techniques. Further work may be necessary to investigate several dynamic resource allocation techniques and their complexity against the other non-dynamic schemes on the significance of the solutions.
