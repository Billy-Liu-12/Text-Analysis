Abstract - Mobile Ad hoc Networks are wireless networks  without an infrastructure which are set up for a  temporary basis to serve a particular purpose with a  specific period of time. In this Modern technology the aim  of Mobile Ad hoc Networks is to provide seamlessly  communication in wireless technology by adopting routing  protocol functionality in the mobile nodes.  Multimedia  real time system like voice, data, videoconferencing with  Quality of service support in big issues and challenges task  on Mobile ad hoc Network. Lots of research work and  effort have been done since last few years to provide the  solution of different problem and challenges related to  Mobile ad hoc Networks.

I. INTRODUCTION    Mobile communication is developing very rapidly and  with passages of time, new technologies are being introduced to facilitate the mobile users more from the technology. The  past technologies are replaced by new ones and needs are  growing for the new technologies to be developed. One such  development is 4G Networks. The introduction of 4G has  widened the scope of mobile communication. Now mobile is  not only a device used for talking but it?s more or less a  portable computer that can serve different purpose. 4G offers  higher data rate with seamless roaming. The mobile user can  communicate without any disturbance while switching his  coverage area.

The 4G has been developed with the aim of high data  transmission speed as well as to accommodate quality of  services (QoS) feature. 4G user will have more demands for  seamless roaming across different wireless network, support of  various services (e.g. multimedia application and QoS guaranteed). The mobile technologies will provide access to  users, simultaneously providing high bandwidth, low latency,  low power consumption and wide area data service to a large  number of mobile users. For this, we need to design a system  that gives the benefit to the overall characteristics.

For best QoS We have proposed Proactive and Reactive ad  hoc mobile routing protocol in hard real time system for  timely delivery of the data packets in an autonomous system.

Proactive routing protocols attempt to maintain consistent, up-  to-date routing information from each node to every node in  the network. These protocols require each node to maintain  one or more table to store routing information and they  respond to change in network topology by propagating route  Rashree Rajkumari  Dept of Electronic and Communication Engineering Don Bosco College of Engineering & Technology, Guwahati  rajshreerajkumari@gmail.com  IEEE - 31661  4th ICCCNT - 2013 July 4 - 6, 2013, Tiruchengode, India    updates throughout the network to maintain a consistent  network view.  In Reactive routing protocol creates routes  only when desired by the source node. When a node requires a  route to the destination, it initiates a route discovery process  within the network. This process is completed once a route is  found or all possible route permutation have been examined.

The main aim of QoS routing in MANET is to select proper  routes with sufficient amount of resources for data packet and  increase the network quality capable of supporting and  maintaining them. Here we propose two Proactive and three  Reactive ad hoc mobile routing protocols with simulation  based result on efficient and accurate data delivery on timely  basis using OPNET 14.5 Simulator. In comparison of this  routing protocols OLSR give some better overall performance.

Some simulation and result are illustrated here for  optimization technique to achieve and improve performance to  reduce overhead.



II. OVERVIEW OF ROUTING PROTOCOL   To discuss in details the current MANET Routing  protocols concept as described by Internet Engineering Task  Force(IETF) MANET working group as well as IEEE 802.11.

In particular OLSR(Optimized Link State Routing),  GRP(Gateway Routing Protocol) , AODV(Ad Hoc On  Demand Distance vector Routing), DSR (Dynamic Source  Routing),  TORA(Temporally Ordered Routing Algorithm)  are discussed along  with a review of previous research  implementation.

A.    AODV (Ad Hoc On Demand Distance vector  Routing) It is a pure on-demand route acquisition system. Nodes  which are not on a selected path do not maintain routing  information or participate in routing table exchanges.

However, the distance vector function of AODV seems to be  absent. Route Requests (RREQ) are forwarded in a manner similar to DSR When a node re-broadcasts a Route Request, it  sets up a reverse path pointing towards the source .AODV  assumes symmetric (bi-directional) links. When the intended  destination receives a Route Request, it replies by sending a  Route Reply (RREP) Route Reply travels along the reverse  path set-up when Route Request is forwarded. When a source  node wants to send a message to some destination node and  does not already have a valid route to that destination, it  initiates a path discovery process to locate the other node. It  broadcasts a route request (RREQ) packet to its neighbors,  which then forward the request to their neighbors. AODV uses destination sequence numbers to ensure that all routes are  loop-free and contain the most recent route information. Each  node maintains its own sequence number, as well as a  broadcast ID. The broadcast ID is incremented for every  RREQ the node initiates, and together with the node's IP  address, uniquely identifies an RREQ. Along with its own  sequence number and the broadcast ID, the source node  includes in the RREQ the most recent sequence number it has  for the destination. Intermediate nodes can reply to the RREQ  only if they have a route to the destination whose  corresponding destination sequence number is greater than or  equal to that contained in the RREQ. At the time of  forwarding the RREQ, intermediate nodes record the address  of neighbors from which the first copy of broadcast packet was received, in their route tables, to establishing a reverse  path.

B.   DSR (Dynamic Source Routing) The Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocol is an on-  demand routing protocol that is based on the concept of source  routing. Mobile nodes are required to maintain route caches  that contain the source routes of which the mobile is aware.

Entries in the route cache are continually updated as new routes are learned. The protocol consists of two major phases:  (a) Route discovery  (b) Route maintenance.

When a mobile node has a packet to send to some  destination, it first consults its route cache to determine  whether it already has a route to the destination. If it has an  unexpired route to the destination, it will use this route to send  the packet. If the node does not have such a route, it initiates  route discovery by broadcasting a route request packet. This  route request message contains the address of the destination,  along with the source node's address and a unique  identification number. Each node receiving the packet checks whether it knows of a route to the destination. If it does not, it  adds its own address to the route record of the packet and then  forwards the packet along its outgoing links.

C.   TORA (Temporally Order Routing Protocol) TORA is a highly adaptive, loop-free, distributed routing algorithm based on the concept of link reversal. It is proposed  to operate in a highly dynamic mobile networking  environment. It is source-initiated and provides multiple  routes for any desired source/destination pair. The key design  concept of TORA is the localization of control messages to a  very small set of nodes near the occurrence of a topological  change. To accomplish this, nodes need to maintain routing  information about adjacent (one-hop) nodes. The protocol  performs three basic functions:  (a) Route creation, (b) Route maintenance, and (c) Route  erasure.

TORA is a highly adaptive loop-free distributed routing algorithm based on the concept of link reversal. In this  Routing protocol the height metric is used to model the  routing state of the network. During the route creation and  maintenance phases nodes use a height metric to establish a  Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) rooted at the destination.

Thereafter links are assigned a direction based on the relative  heights.

D.   GRP (Gateway Routing Protocol) GRP is a table-driven-based routing protocol where mobile  nodes are grouped into cluster and each cluster has a cluster  head. A cluster head can control a group of ad hoc hosts, and  IEEE - 31661  4th ICCCNT - 2013 July 4 - 6, 2013, Tiruchengode, India    clustering provides a framework for code separation channel  access, routing, and bandwidth allocation. To elect, a cluster  head a distributed cluster head selection algorithm is used.

Usually a cluster head allows some form of controls and  coordination it does impose reliance from other nodes within  the cluster. When the cluster head moves away, another new cluster head must be selected. This can be problem if a cluster  head is changing frequently and nodes will spending a lot of  time converging to a cluster head instead of forwarding data  toward their intended destination.

E.  OLSR (Optimized Link State Routing) OLSR is a proactive routing protocol for MANETs OLSR is an optimization over the classical link state protocol for  MANETs. OLSR minimizes the overhead from flooding of  control   traffic   by   using   only   selected   nodes,   called  MPRs, to retransmit control messages. This technique  significantly reduces the number of retransmissions required  to flood   a message to all nodes in the network. Secondly,  OLSR requires only partial link state to be flooded in order to  provide shortest path routes. The minimal set of link state  information required is that all nodes, selected as MPRs, must  declare the links to their MPR selectors[5]. OLSR may  optimize topological changes by reducing the maximum time interval for periodic   control   message   transmission.

Furthermore, as OLSR continuously maintains routes to all  destinations in the network, the protocol is beneficial for  traffic patterns where a large subset of nodes are  communicating with another large subset of nodes, and where  the [source, destination] pairs are changing over time The  protocol is particularly suited for large and dense networks,  as the optimization does using MPRs works well in this  context. The larger and more dense a network, the more  optimization can be achieved as compared to the classic link  state algorithm.



III.   RELATED WORK   S.Arjun Rajesh et al., (2012) describe about routing  optimization performance on ad hoc network distributed  approaches using 4G Device. In this paper they have control  the resource and they have used the Session imitation protocol  support so that they can make and received VOIP phone called  within the range of WIFI.

Satish Mittal et al., (2011) discuss about the comparison of  mobile ad hoc routing protocols for their research they have  taken 3 routing protocols namely AODV, TORA, and OLSR.

They have compared the performance in throughput, end to end delay, media access delay, packet delivery ratio. In this  paper they have compare all the routing protocol and conclude  that OLSR has high throughput and in packet delivery ratio  also. They say that OLSR performs quite predictably,  delivering virtually mobile data packets at node mobility.

Jahangir Khan et al., (2011)   discuss about the step of mobile  ad hoc  on demand routing protocol towards 4G cellular  networks. In this paper their aim is Mobile ad hoc routing  protocols to provide efficient communication in wireless  technology by adopting routing efficiently communication in  wireless technology mostly in 4G networks. For their  simulation they have taken three routing protocols AODV, DSR, TORA. They have taken 50 mobile nodes and analysed  the traffic load and delay of the FTP scenario. At the end they  concluded that TORA have give better performance for the  Quality of Service (QoS) support. Lastly, they concluded DSR  is best for the small network establishment but not efficient for  large network and they have high load in term of traffic area  delay which will increase overhead. And they conclude that  TORA is good for adopting large networks.

Rajneesh Kumar Gujral et al., (2011) discuss about the  performance analysis of Ad hoc routing protocols for voice  communication support over hybrid MANETS. In this paper they describe the Quality of Service support the challenges  task on Mobile ad hoc network. They have comparison of QoS  parameter such as packet delivery ratio, end to end delay,  packet delay variation, routing overhead, throughput and jitter.

For their research they have taken 16 nodes, simulation time  600 sec, ad hoc network 2, proxy server -1, and ad hoc routing  protocols i.e AODV, DSR, TORA, OLSR.  They define that  OLSR is best as all QoS parameter, TORA protocol is than  OLSR, and AODV protocol is better performance than DSR.

Lastly, they conclude that DSR is the worst performance of all  this routing protocols.

In Sarra Benoubira, Mounir Frikha et.al. (2011), they  implement Mobile Resource Reservation Protocol (MRSVP)  in the fourth generation mobile network to guarantee the QoS  for real time application. In this architecture registration of  nodes are handled within the hierarchy not need to  communicated to the HA. This architecture aim to provide  first and efficient handovers between WIMAX and WLAN  networks for the mobile node registered in the UMTS  network.

Table 3 : Performance analysis of five Routing Protocols       A.  RESULT ANALYSIS  After seeing  the table of the comparison of five routing protocol in the file download response time AODV  give better response time AODV give 0.01 sec , DSR give  0.02,GRP give 0.1 as same as AODV , OLSR give 0.05 sec  and TORA also give 0.1 sec. Again in the upload response  time of File upload response time AODV give 0.1 sec, DSR  give 0.1sec, GRP give 0.1 almost same  as  the three protocol but OLSR and TORA give the worst upload response time  0.04 and 0.06 sec. Let see in the delay time of file AODV give  0.0007sec, DSR give 0.0009 sec, GRP also give same as DSR  i.e. 0.0009 sec, OLSR give 0.0006 sec and TORA give 0.0018  sec. In this case TORA gives the worst routing protocol as  compare to the other protocol. Lastly we have compared  in  the throughput in this OLSR give better performance of  160000 bit/sec, GRP give 39,000bit/sec, AODV  give 29,000  bit/sec, DSR give 21,000 bit/sec and TORA give 10,000  bit/sec.

We came to the conclusion that for the overall performance OLSR gives the better performance compared to  all the above routing protocols. For increase the QoS on  enhancing 3G towards 4G routing protocol OLSR may  contribute for higher data throughput and delay ratio. In  comparison of the above table OLSR gives the better  performance in Wireless LAN Throughput and Wireless LAN  Delay.  But in fie download and file upload response time  AODV give better performance than OLSR. Again let us see  the comparison on AODV and DSR. AODV give the better  overall performance from DSR. Again, comparison of OLSR and TORA. OLSR give the better overall performance from  TORA. After comparison one by one we conclude than OLSR  IEEE - 31661  4th ICCCNT - 2013 July 4 - 6, 2013, Tiruchengode, India    give the better performance compared to all the routing  protocol.

At last we have to conclude there is no appropriate  routing protocols which give the better overall performance  which we can implement on the 4G Networks. In analysis of  the performance some protocol gives better performance in another performance like download response time give worst  case time. In short this is one of the challenging issues of  choosing the right protocol at 4G Network

VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE SCOPE  I present the simulation result of five wireless routing protocol  under scalable mobile condition for the correctness and  efficiency in 32 WLAN nodes, which effect greatly in routing  and size of the network 10M X 10M of the comparison of five  routing protocol AODV, OLSR, DSR, TORA and GRP in  term of file upload, file download, throughput and delay of  Wireless LAN network. In this overall performance OLSR  gives better performance in throughput and delay.  But in file upload and download AODV gives better performance than  OLSR. This is one of the issues of routing protocols of  MANET which protocol has been applied on the enhancement  of 3G to 4G. In short according to my concept the better  overall performance of routing protocol is OLSR.

After implementation 4G Networks in India scale commercial purpose the OLSR Routing protocols proof to  have a better performance as compared to the above routing  protocols. The QoS will dynamically increase shift from 3G to  4G. The results of this work point following the directions of research are likely to be needed for further improvement. By  using another project of the voice transmission and comparing  the performance of routing protocol.
