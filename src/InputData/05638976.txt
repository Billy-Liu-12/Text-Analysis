Abstract?Mobile power equipment is an important measure  to reduce customer outages. It enables power-uninterrupted repairs and maintenance. It can be added to the networks to quickly restore power service after fault occurrence and hence reduce power outage time. This paper presents the results of a project recently performed within the Smart Grids R&D program at the power company Vattenfall, in Sweden. The project analyzed, among other things, the effect of using mobile power equipment on power supply reliability based on the outage data and statistics from Vattenfall network company in Sweden.

The results show that there is big potential in reducing outages and increasing reliability of power supply. By using mobile power equipment combined with LW (live working) methods, interruption-free work in both station environment and on power lines can be performed. This will potentially eliminate planned outages up to 90% and hence significantly improve the utility?s power service reliability.

planned customer interruptions and decrease durations of long forced outages. Mobile equipment offers possibility to enhance power supply reliability and reduces investment cost of fixed redundant equipment.

There are many advantages to have proper mobile power equipment:  It enables reducing customer power outages. It allows operation and repair crews to completely isolate equipment for maintenance or repairs without disrupting power service. This reduces maintenance and repair related power interruptions and outage durations, and enhances power service reliability.

Mobile power equipment can be utilized to provide power- uninterrupted service.

Mobile equipment offers better working environment for repair and maintenance crews. The crews do not need working with electrical voltage. When you can, for example, completely isolate a transformer by using a mobile transformer you can do a better job.

Installation of redundant network components on power systems can increase service reliability, but is expensive.

Mobile equipment can be used as moveable spare network component and can be soon placed in service. Mobile equipment allows therefore reduction of investment on redundant network components.

In order to reduce customer outages and increase power service reliability, a project was recently performed within the R&D program Smart Grids at the power company, Vattenfall, in Sweden. The purpose of the project is to study and analyze mobile power equipment related issues and search for a cost- effective way for the application. One of the important issues studied in the project is how much power supply reliability can be increased and how much power outages can be reduced by using mobile power equipment. Based on the outage data and statistics from Vattenfall network company in Sweden the project analyzed the potential in reducing customer outages and evaluated the impact of mobile power equipment on power supply reliability.

The detailed analysis and the results are presented and discussed in the subsequent sections of the paper.



III.  MOBILE POWER EQUIPMENT Mobile power equipment is an important tool to reduce  customer interruptions. It has been found many applications worldwide for reducing customer outage time and for restoring power by emergency back up power supply.

The applications of the vehicle on-board mobile power  M     equipment are in principle at two levels: station level and component level. At the station level, the whole station is assembled on one or two trailers and could be moved easily to the load site to give emergency power supply. The mobile substation cabinet mounted on the trailer may include substation transformer, disconnect switches, circuit breakers, and fuses. There may be also a ground fault protection system, low voltage control transformer, circuit breaker panel, and low voltage control panel used to check current and voltage for each feed. The transformer monitor may also be included. The mobile power station can be constructed in high capacity and soon be placed in service in need of a temporary power station.

At the component application level, various types of equipment are used, including mobile power generators, transformers, switches etc. They can be quickly transported and added to the networks to substitute the individual power component that needs to be removed from service for repairs and maintenance. Mobile power generator is an important component. It offers flexible modes of power generation and is widely used as back up and emergency power supply. There are various sized mobile generators available, from several kW portable generator sets up to approximately one MW power generator system. The controller based mobile engine generator can be back up not only three-phase but also single- phase distribution line.

Today vehicle and mobile power equipment are, to some extent, used at Vattenfall network and service companies.

They are used in some of the maintenance and repair work in order to give emergency power supply and reduce downtime of power supply. Several types of mobile power equipment are utilized including:  ?? Mobile power substations; ?? By-pass switch cabins; ?? Auxiliary power supply (mobile power generator); ?? Mobile transformers; ?? Mobile power cables.

Vattenfall Distribution Nordic has developed the concept on mobile substation. A mobile 40/20/10 kV substation, called Rulle, has been in service since 2005. Another one, called Bamse, 170/55/24 kV, was put on voltage in Aug. 2007.

Today they are functioning well and used mainly for four purposes: (1) provide emergency power supply in the case of failure at sub-transmission station; (2) substitute the equipment at sub-transmission station that needs to be removed from service for repairs and maintenance; (3) energize quickly temporary loads; (4) substitute the station when rebuilding or reconstructing the station.

By-pass switch cabin, as shown in Fig. 1 is one type of mobile power equipment utilized frequently by Vattenfall Service in the work of network repair and maintenance. It has a built-in-disconnector with fuses, and by connecting with insulated rubber cables it bypasses the objects to be maintained or repaired. Due to the device connected in parallel over the object, one can perform maintenance and  repair without breaking the power service. The by-pass unit consists mainly of a 24 kV switch station with fuse-load- switches, rubber cables of length 3 x 20 m + 3 x 15 m, insulators with outlet for measurement of test instruments, and earthing equipment. Vattenfall service company fully utilizes their by-pass switch units in performing interruption-free maintenance and repair of components in switch station environment, such as switches, circuit breakers, bus-bars, insulators, transformers, etc.

Fig. 2 shows MV mobile power supply equipment-set which makes up of a power generator, a secondary substation (inclusive a transformer, protection and switch equipment), and a piece of power cable. This arrangement offers flexible modes for emergency power service. It supports quick power recovery from line or cable failures, transformer failures, and failures on secondary sub-stations. It can be also used for interruption-free maintenance and repair work.

Potential benefits of using mobile power equipment in increasing power supply reliability are gained mainly from three aspects:  ?? Reduce number of scheduled outages by arranging in advance mobile power equipment to substitute, without interrupting customers, the equipment that needs to be removed from service for repairs and     maintenance.

?? Reduce duration of scheduled outages by  arranging mobile equipment to substitute the equipment that needs to be removed in a long time from service for repairs and maintenance.

?? Reduce durations of forced outages by using mobile power equipment supply emergency power and quickly restore power service.

The subsequent sections describe the project work and analyses of potential reduction of scheduled power outages and associated improvement in power supply reliability by using mobile power equipment. The analyses were performed based on the input data and outage statistics at Vattenfall Distribution Sweden.



IV.  POTENTIAL REDUCTION OF SCHEDULED OUTAGES The power systems are subject to planned interruptions.

Planned interruptions are scheduled in order to perform various activities, such as maintenance, equipment testing, installation of new or upgraded equipment, connecting new customers, network refurbishment, and equipment repair and replacement. The most common causes of planned power interruptions are:  ?? Maintenance; ?? Repair work and equipment replacement; ?? Network rebuild, upgrade, and reinforcement; ?? New network connections.

From time to time Vattenfall Distribution Sweden carries out the work on the electricity systems to maintain and upgrade the networks. For practical reasons the power supply is sometimes intentionally interrupted to enable the work on the networks. An analysis of about 130 operation orders for the planned power interruptions in 2007 showed that approximately 57% planned power interruptions were attributed to maintenance and network rebuild and upgrades, 16% due to equipment repair and replacement, and 27% due to new network and customer connections, as shown in Fig. 3.

Planned interruptions by cause  57%  16%  27% Maintenance, network rebuild and upgrade Repair work  New network connections  Fig. 3.  Planned interruptions by cause.

The further analysis of the interruptions by equipment category shows that the planned customer outages due to maintenance and work on lines and cables account for approximately 58% of all the scheduled outages, and the planned work on power stations accounts for around 39%.

The company is continually upgrading and maintaining its networks. During maintenance or upgrade works, both DW method (working without voltage, i.e., working with planned customer interruptions) and LW technique (live working or working with voltage, i.e., working without customer interruptions) are used. However the most of the network upgrading and maintaining work is performed with planned customer interruptions according to the statistics in 2007.

Vattenfall Service has developed different LW methods.

Utilization of mobile power equipment together with the LW techniques serves as an important way in the live-line working practice. The mobile by-pass switch units, mobile cables as well as mobile generators are, for example, used in combination with LW techniques and become important elements in the interruption-free work on power systems.

This combined technique may include various types of mobile components. When performing work, mobile equipment is connected to the network using LW method without interrupting power supply to replace the equipment that needs to be removed from service for maintenance and repair. Thanks to the mobile equipment, the device being worked upon can be completely isolated, and the maintenance/repair work can then be carried on in voltage-off states. When you can completely isolate the device with the proper mobile power equipment you can do a better job. This combined technique enables therefore interruption-free better maintenance and repair work on power networks and influences on considerable reduction of planned customer interruptions.

Vattenfall Service, who has the high skills needed to perform LW work, can, with the help of combined mobile power equipment and LW method, perform interruption-free work in both station environment and on power lines. This skill and the combined mobile power equipment and LW technique give great opportunities for continually upgrading and maintaining power networks without disrupting electricity supply and allow eliminating the planned customer outages practically expected up to 90%.



V.  POTENTIAL IMPACT ON POWER SUPPLY RELIABILITY Eliminating the planned customer outages has very positive  impact on power supply reliability. This section presents the results of the project work that estimates how much the power supply reliability can be potentially increased if the planned customer interruptions could be eliminated by 90%.

SAIFI (System Average Interruption Frequency Index) is commonly used as an important reliability index by power utilities to indicate how often a customer would be interrupted over a year. Performance based SAIFI is calculated by:  SAIFI = total number of customer interruptions / total number of customers served.

The customer interruptions are directly related to the SAIFI and the total number of planned customer interruptions was calculated over the period of 2004 ? 2007. An overview of the results of the calculations is summarized in TABLE 1, which gives the total customer interruptions on the networks of the company by voltage level and by outage duration.

TABLE 2 shows the contributions of total planned customer interruptions on 0.4 ? 135 kV networks to the utility?s SAIFI values. The planned outages gave 0.35 ? 0.55 interruptions per customer year in average. As shown in Fig. 4 this implies that the utility?s SAIFI could be reduced potentially by 0.32 ? 0.5 (int./yr.cust.) if the planned interruptions were eliminated by 90%.

SAIDI is the average outage duration for each customer served, and its performance value is calculated as:  SAIDI = sum of all customer interruption durations/total number of customers served.

SAIDI is measured in units of time over a period of time, often minutes or hours over the course of a year. Customer interruption minutes are directly related to SAIDI and were calculated by voltage level, area, and duration category.

The results indicate that, as shown in Fig. 5, 1 ? 5 hour planned interruptions result in a large amount of customer minutes lost. The majority of customer interruption minutes, approximately 50 ? 70%, are given by the planned interruptions with the duration of 1 ? 5 hours. However the interruptions over 12 hours are infrequent and give very little contribution to customer minutes lost.

Based on customer minutes lost the contributions to SAIDI are calculated. The results are presented in TABLE 3 and Fig.

6. It is shown that the planned outages at the company resulted in approximately 41 ? 63 (min/yr.cust.) to SAIDI value. If 90% of planned outages could be eliminated, the reductions of SAIDI contributions would be around 37 ? 57 (min/yr.cust.) as indicated in Fig. 6.

If the planned outages could be eliminated by 90% then the company?s SAIFI value would be reduced to 2.08 ? 2.45 (int/yr.cust.), which would give 13 ? 17% improvement. A total SAIDI would be reduced to 174 ? 667 (min/yr.cust.), a potential 8 ? 22% improvement of the company?s SAIDI value would be realized. The overall system reliability (ASAI) would then be increased from 99.86 ? 99.96% to 99.87 ? 99.97%.

The results of the analysis show that there is big potential in reducing scheduled customer outages and increasing reliability of power supply. By applying mobile power equipment combined with LW (live working) methods, interruption-free maintenance and repair work can be realized, and the company?s system reliability could be increased significantly.

VI. CONCLUSION Mobile power equipment is an important tool to reduce  customer interruptions and offers possibility to enhance power service reliability. This paper presents the results of a project recently performed at the power company, Vattenfall, in Sweden. The project studied mobile power equipment related issues for application purpose. One of important concerns was how far we could increase power supply reliability and how much we could reduce scheduled power outages by using mobile equipment.

Based on the performance data and outage statistics of a period of four years at Vattenfall network company in Sweden, the project analyzed impact on power service reliability by application of mobile power equipment. The analysis shows that mobile power equipment combined with LW technique has potential to eliminate planned customer outages expected up to 90% and improves the reliability significantly. The company?s SAIFI value would be potentially improved by 13-17%. A potential 8-22% improvement of the company?s SAIDI value would be realized. The overall system reliability would then be increased from 99.86-99.96% to 99.87-99.97%.
