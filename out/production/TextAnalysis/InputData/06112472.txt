Application of Data Mining Technology in Excavating Prevention and  Treatment Experience of Infectious Diseases from Famous Herbalist Doctors

Abstract?This study is to explore effect and significance of data mining technology (DMT) used in excavating prevention and treatment experience of infectious diseases from famous herbalist doctors (FHDs). DMT methods such as cluster analysis and association rules was applied to the study on FHDs literature on preventing and treating influenza, dysentery, tuberculosis, viral hepatitis and other infectious diseases in order to excavate the inner rules and refine the regular understanding. The result shows that cluster analysis is helpful to summarize the common understanding of experience including concept of syndrome differentiation, regulation of diagnosis and treatment, prescription characteristic, which based on FHDs? prevention and treatment of influenza (including A H1N1), viral hepatitis and other infectious diseases. Association rules greatly contributed to the judgment of relationship between etiology, syndrome, symptoms and herbal prescription of infectious diseases. In conclusion, DMT provides technical support for concise and inheritance of academic thought which originates from FHDs.

DMT is of high application value in research of experience of FHDs and relevant literature, and is worth further discussion.

I. INTRODUCTION The mining of the experience of FDHs against infectious  diseases is of great significance for the inheritance of FDHs academic ideas. Currently, the common methods used mostly is taking names, names of diseases, prescriptions, clinical features of thinking as the clue for summarization[1], the monographs and papers play a certain role in the inheritance of  FDH experience, but there are also problems. Firstly, the scope of compiled medical cases, medical monograph and other data is limited to a particular FDHs [2]; Secondly, the data collection is limited to a certain type or a certain historical period [3]; Furthermore, there is lack of theoretic understanding of FDHs on some rare or uncommon diseases. As the purpose of mining the clinical experience of FDHs is not only limited to the theoretic understanding and medication experience of a FDHs on a certain disease. more importantly, it is to  integrate the understanding of a number of FDHs on the pathogenesis of the disease and herbal prescription in long- term clinical practice, to form the theory and method which is relatively uniform and helpful for guiding clinical practice. thus to establish the modern chinese medicine theory and the basis of syndrome differentiation and treatment of disease.

Faced with a large number of medical cases, monographs, papers and other materials by FDHs, to manually analyze the relationships and laws among these valuable clinical experience and form a common understanding is obviously powerless. Application of modern scientific and technological means and methods - data mining can provide a strong and powerful tool for such studies[4]. For example: applying the association rules for analysis of the large number of monographs by FDHs can help to find the association rules hidden among the pathology, prescription and medication; analysis of the medical cases of FDHs applying the association rules can help understanding the causes of disease, disease location, pathogenesis and differentiation of internal relations; the cluster analysis is helpful for summing up consensus information of FDHs on the core manifestation, syndromes and prescription medication of certain diseases; compared to ordinary frequency statistics, the consensus derived from cluster analysis is more clearer, and the degree of unity of the same class is more stronger[5]. In 2009,  the project study implementing the "key special projects of National Science and Technology -Establishment of Emergency Treatment Capacity of Traditional Chinese Medicine for major infectious diseases", data mining techniques such as cluster analysis and association rules were used to mine and sort out the experience of contemporary FDHs against infectious diseases, and formed the common understanding of more than 350 contemporary FDHs on pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, dialectical thinking and herbal prescription of influenza (including influenza A H1N1), tuberculosis, viral hepatitis, dysentery and other diseases.

Now we will take the data mining of contemporary FDHs experience in prevention and treatment of influenza (including influenza A H1N1) and viral hepatitis as an       example, to introduce the application of this technology and the application effect.



II. DATA SOURCE AND METHOD  A. Data source The medical cases, monographs, published papers,  questionnaire, and experience interviews about etiology and pathogenesis and treatment method and prescriptions in influenza (including influenza A H1N1) and viral hepatitis which derive from more than 218 alive contemporary FDHs against infectious diseases across the country.

B. Data preprocessing Classified the data on the basis of the requirements of  data mining technology and combining with the contents of medical cases, medical monographs, questionnaires, and experience interviews. And then classified the data into five sections such as etiology and pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, syndrome differentiation, treatment principles and herbal prescription.

The statistical software SPSS 18.0 was used. Take each classified item as a database attributes, which <15% in each classification will not included in the database.

For situation of fuzzy representation or inconsistency, process of the Chinese medicine term will be carried. The specific solutions include: the establishment of a synonym table; split or deduce in combination of professional knowledge; refer to the Chinese medicine name listed in "Traditional Chinese Medicine Name Dictionary".

C. Data mining algorithms Two data mining methods were applied in this study:  one was cluster analysis and the other was association rules.

For the different classifications of the literature in the  database after pretreatment, the DBScan algorithm was used for clustering, the initial parameters (radius, temporary neighbors within at least a few) were set according to the data processing need, to result in clustering.

The Apriori algorithm was used to generate the sets of frequent itemsets; for each set of frequent itemsets, the minimum confidence and minimum support in the association analysis were adjusted, to improve the correlation between itemsets; According to the form of association rules (such as: "Chinese medicine ? clinical symptoms, pathogenesis ? traditional Chinese medicine", "syndromes ? traditional Chinese medicine"), select the rules which complies with the form(such as confidence level greater than 70%) from the different association rules.



III. RESULTS In the results section, the results respectively analyzed  by cluster analysis and association rules were presented.

The cluster analysis method was used to explore the underlying rules of etiology, syndrome differentiation, treatment principles and herbal prescription in real practice of Chinese herbal medicine. The association rules method  was applied to extract the hidden correlation between etiology and the use of Chinese herbal medicine, between different syndrome types and the use of Chinese herbal medicine, and between symptoms and the use of Chinese herbal medicine.

Rhizoma Cyperi and Radix bupleuri can be used for hypochondriac pain; Radix codonopsis, Poria cocos, Pericarpium Citri Reticulatae, Semen Coicis and hawthorn are mostly used for spleen deficiency. Radix codonopsis and radix astragali are usually used for Qi deficiency; Fructus aurantii, Magnolia officinalis and Pericarpium Citri Reticulatae can be used for abdominal distention; pachyma cocos, hawthorn, Herba Eupatorii and Radix codonopsis can be used for appetite; pachyma cocos and Semen Coicis are usually used for edema.

Thus, from the data mining results, the experience common understanding of FHDs in prevention and treatment of infectious diseases can be found, which can provide a reference basis for herbal prescription of clinical practice and is helpful for heritage and development of academic thinking of FHDs.



V. DISCUSSION With the explosive growth of information, data mining  technology has been widely used in finance, telecommunications, insurance, retails, medical science and other fields. In recent years, the combination of the technology with the research of traditional Chinese medicine has become more closely and has penetrated deeply into the analysis of medical literature, which is of great significance for learning of Chinese medical cases, Medical monographs and the excavation and succession of the academic ideas of FDHs. Application of the data mining technology in exploring the FDHs experience against infectious diseases is the useful explore in this area. In addition, the results of data mining can also provide a reference for the consensus program of infectious diseases prevention and treatment expert or the development of diagnosis and treatment guideline, for example: the data mining technology was used in Traditional Chinese Medicine Prevention programs for H1N1 influenza (2009 Edition) [6].

In summary, the application of data mining techniques in the study of the type of literature information of FHDs can greatly improve the utilization efficiency of medical cases, medical works, papers, expert interview contents of FDHs, thus contributing to the conciseness and inheritance of the academic experience of FHDs; also contribute to the formation of theory, treatment guidelines or consensus program for guiding clinical practice.

However, data mining techniques also have limitations.

Firstly, data mining, the use of data mining techniques in analysis of literature type data is still in its starting stage, with no mature application framework formed yet; Secondly, syndrome differentiation and treatment requires individual treatment programs, but treatment simply based on computer technology can not completely replace the individualized academic ideas of FHDs. Thus, although the data mining techniques (such as text mining etc.) is continuing to make progress, the results obtained through  mining of literature type information still requires processing and supplementation of human brain.
