A New Equation Based Single Rate Multicast  Congestion Control

Abstract?A computer network is basically the combination of computers and different type of devices that are interfaced by a range of resources i.e. communications channels that provide the communications between users and allow them ability of sharing the resources. Multicasting is used to send the information from one receiver to group of receivers. But it is faced big issue because of additional data demand of receivers which may cause of congestion. There are different approach to control congestion i.e. single rate and multi rate approach. We are considering the single rate approach. TCP friendly multicast congestion control technique (TFMCC) is basically a first single rate multicast congestion control technique. It uses the steady state equation to adjust the throughput. But this mechanism has the problem of feedback implosion. It creates the congestion at the source side.

This problem was solved by pragmatic general multicast congestion control (PGMCC) approach. In this paper, we provide an effective mechanism for multicast congestion control which work based on utilization of situation and improve the solution with respect to TFMCC, PGMCC.

I.  INTRODUCTION The fast increase of the Internet has spark the demand of  several new applications of group communication, such as spread Databases, Distributed Computing, Real Time Group Communication, combined Videoconferencing, Media-on- demand Broadcast, and size box file Transfer Protocol (FTP) for software delivery. All these applications need a resourceful sharing of data simultaneously to multiple receivers  With the rapid development of Internet technology multicast technology is widely used. Users can simply talk to others in an effective method and users can use video conferencing, You Tube, email, instant messaging (Meebo, Yahoo, and MSN), chat rooms[1] video calls online chat. By distribution hardware resources which is far from other resources. Every host in the network environment can access and use hardware resources which live in that network location, i.e. taking the printout using the printer which is on the common network.

The demand of computer networking is increasing day by day. In  recent  text  was used to send the information but now  the demand of video data  i.e. video conferencing,  YouTube, IPTV etc is increasing. The robustness of the current internet is due, in large part to the end-to-end congestion control mechanism of transmission control protocol (TCP) [6].

It is generally known that TCP dominates current internet process as it represents 70% to 90% of traffic. Due to this request of bandwidth is increasing to handle the huge amount of traffic. User want quality of service (minimum delay, maximum throughput, minimum delay and minimum loss) so the problem with load balancing occur. To beat there are several techniques but it is a big issue now due to video on demand increasing. The situation is handled by multicast communication with very efficient way. Because many interested group of receivers received the data at a time from source. The communication is known as group communication [27]. But it suffers from different problem. First problem is attack on source and receivers due to well known IP addresses of source as well as group. Second one is Congestion due to more demand of traffic and heterogeneous environment of receivers [24].

Many researchers [5][7][9][13][19][24][29] have provide different techniques to control the congestion situation in multicast communication. These techniques are furthers divided into single rate and multi rate. In single rate [11][12][26][29][32] [33] only one stream is sending by source and receiver accepts this stream according to capacity of resources. In multi-rate approach [5]][7][56], sender sends different streams to receivers and receivers received join the group according to streams. In this paper, we focus on congestion issue of multicast communication. The objective of this paper is to develop an efficient single rate multicast congestion control technique.



II. RELATED WORK  Computer network is the essential piece of the networking.

When the data is transferred several scenarios i.e. congestion in the network, quality of service etc could take place.

Multicasting is used to send the information from one to group of receivers. It is a big issue because of more data demand of receivers is known as congestion. The plan of multicast congestion control has to tackle several more problems such as Feedback Implosion, rate adaptation for vast heterogeneous     receivers, Round Trip Time (RTT) and packet loss estimation for multiple receivers. There are two different techniques to control the congestion i.e. single rate multicast congestion control and multi-rate multicast congestion control techniques.

TCP Friendly Multicast Congestion control Technique (TFMCC) is basically a single rate multicast congestion control technique. It uses the steady state equation to adjust the throughput. But this mechanism has the problem of feedback implosion. It creates the congestion at the source side. This problem was solved by pragmatic general multicast congestion control (PGMCC) approach. The problem in PGMCC is a round trip time and packet loss calculation problem due to feedback implosion.

We have studied some paper related of multicast congestion control mechanism.  Literature reviews of those papers are following:  Ashraf Matrawy and Ioannis Lambadaris [11] have presented a survey of multicast congestion control schemes for video applications. We started with end-to-end schemes, presenting both single-rate schemes and layered schemes.

Advantages and disadvantages of each scheme were presented and general problems with the end-to- end methodology were discussed. Authors also presented router schemes to support congestion control for IP Multicast. This grouped them into two main categories and presented a number of these schemes.

Je-young Yu et.al. [30] proposed an effective congestion control mechanism known as TCP Multicast Rate Congestion Control (TMRCC) for tree-based many-to-many reliable multicast protocols. The proposed scheme is based on the congestion windowing mechanism and a rate controller is used in addition. The feedback for error recovery is exploited for congestion control as well to minimize the overhead at the receivers. The ACK timers and the NACK timers are set dynamically reflecting the network condition changes. The rate regulation algorithm in the proposed scheme is designed to help the flows sharing the same link to achieve the fair share quickly.

W. Kammoun, H. Youssef. [32] Presented an improved version of the TFMCC protocol. TFMCC is an equation based single rate MCC protocol.  In TFMCC, each receiver estimates the loss ratio p and RTT, then applies equation 1 to determine the acceptable rate, and sends it as feedback information to the source.

XTCP = S/[RTT((Sqrt(2p/3))+12*(Sqrt(3p/8))p(1+32p2))] .. (1)  The rate is then adjusted according to the receiver with the smallest feedback value, which is designated as the CLR. Two principal modifications are performed. First, a proactive preventive congestion control mechanism is implemented within the source. The mechanism is based on the continuous monitoring by the source of the RTT between itself and the current limiting receiver. Second, each of the receiver estimates its target throughput based on a new equation derived using a model of a multicast source controlled according to the AIMD approach.

Y. Richard Yang Simon S. Lam. [15] discussed multicast congestion control is still a new and active research area. They identified 3 key problems and discussed the current proposed solutions. This also makes a proposal to improve upon the current best approaches. Because of the complexity of multicast congestion control, many problems have to be solved to form a complete solution. For example, one problem we did not discuss is how to limit the local recovery bandwidth in reliable multicast congestion control.

Yuan Gao et.al. [16] gave rate-based congestion control scheme, RACCOOM. In the absence of packet loss, a RACCOOM sender adjusts its sending rate in a TCP-Vegas fashion, based on the congestion status of the on-tree path with the largest RTT (called the target path). In case of packet loss, a RACCOOM sender then resend by reducing its sending rate by half. An ACK aggregation method is judiciously devised to prevent ACK implosion and yet to provide the sender with a simple but comprehensive view of congestion conditions in the multicast tree. RACCOOM also achieve (weighted) fairness among competing connections by exploiting feedback control theory and appropriately selecting the parameters used in the rate adjustment mechanism.

Bian Jing Wang et.al. [17] proposed a new congestion control protocol BDP for layered multicast. BDP uses delay parameters SRdeg and SRdet to estimate the path's available bandwidth in the decision of layer join. If the available bandwidth can sustain the cumulative rate of the next layer, a layer join can be done.

Yiu-Wing Leung. [18] formulated and solved a congestion- control problem in multipoint videoconferencing. In this problem, the packets of different conferences are multicast to different number of conferees, and hence, the loss of a different packet will affect a different number of people. The resulting congestion control strategy has three attractive features. It has a control parameter. We can tune this parameter to make a tradeoff between the mean quality of service and fairness. It only involves some simple arithmetic and logic operations, and some operations can be executed in parallel. Using hardware realization, the strategy can be executed quickly for real-time congestion control.

Xuan Zhang et.al. [10] introduced one multicast control scheme on many-to-many videoconferencing ET-MCC. The end-to-end loss rate are measured and aggregated to one performance server. Bottleneck links are located via tomography methodology. By adjusting the rate of senders that affect the bottleneck links with the same rate adjusting ratio, the sender-fairness could be achieved.

Fan Rui, Cheng Shi-Duan. [31] provided multicast congestion control is the key technology for multicast to be deployed in Internet widely. Currently, single-rate multicast congestion control scheme achieves both TCP-Friendly and scalability but does not solve the problem of intra-group fairness. Slow receiver will slow down the rate of the faster receiver and ultimately the throughput of the whole group.

Multi-rate multicast congestion control scheme although solve the intra-group fairness problem but at the expense of TCP- Friendly. In this case, present a new single-rate multicast congestion control scheme. This algorithm solves the three     challenges that multicast congestion control faces, TCP- Friendly, Scalability, Intra-group fairness by way of TCP-like window mechanism in receiver and filtering mechanism in intermediate routers.

Gu-In Kwon and John W. Byers. [4] presented a multiple rate multicast congestion control design that leverage proven single rate congestion control methods by orchestrating an ensemble of independently controlled single rate sessions. A compelling argument for this new methodology is its evident simplicity: unlike all other viable multiple rate congestion controls protocols. Authors required only a small amount of carefully crafted new functionality.

Mariusz Glabowski et.al. [21] presented an approximate method of blocking probability calculations in switching nodes of virtual circuit networks carrying a mixture of different traffic streams, including multicast traffic. This mixture can be composed of an arbitrary number of unicast and multicast traffic classes. The base of the method is the generalized model of the limited-availability group, i.e. group of separated transmission links of various capacities.

Sherlia Shi, Marcel Waldvogel [22] presented a multicast congestion control scheme based on dynamically identifying the congested sub trees in the network and adjusting data rate according to feedback from these sub trees.

Rui Fan, Shi-Duan Cheng, Yu Lin. [23] give multicast congestion control is the key technology for multicast to be deployed in Internet widely. Currently, single-rate multicast congestion control scheme achieves both TCP-Friendly and scalability but does not solve the problem of intra-group fairness.

Yiu-Wing Leung. [25] formulated and solved a congestion- control problem in multipoint videoconferencing. In this problem, the packets of different conferences are multicast to different number of conferees, and hence, the loss of a different packet will affect a different number of people.

Jiang Li, Shivkumar Kalyanaraman. [34] presented a single rate source-based multicast congestion control scheme. The only support from receivers is output rates at their ends. Based on the output rate feedbacks, the source choose one of the slowest receivers as Congestion Representative (CR), and then adapts the transmission rate correspondingly. Authors have designed several mechanisms to keep the CR choice stable and valid, and checked the performance of the whole scheme with simulations. The simplicity and the way to choose CR distinguish our scheme from previous work e.g. PGMCC [11], TFMCC [12] and MDP-CC [8]. This scheme handles congestion control only, thus can be used in combination with other (e.g. reliability) schemes. Due to its simplicity, it can also be potentially deployed on gateways to separate a multicast tree into different segments, each of which can have its own rate, so that heterogeneous receivers may get data at their individually desired rates.

W. Kammoun and H. Youssef. [32] proposed improvement to the TFMCC protocol via the adoption of a new equation to determine the acceptable rates of the multicast receivers. The new equation was derived from an analytical model that abstracts the behavior of a multicast source controlled according the Additive increase and Multiplicative Decrease (AIMD) strategy. Simulation results show a remarkable improvement in throughput performance.

Gu-In Kwon and John W. Byers. [20] presented SMCC, a multirate equation-based multicast congestion control that leverages a proven single rate congestion control method (TFMCC) by orchestrating an ensemble of independently controlled single rate sessions. By maintaining appropriate invariants on the session rates of the individual TFMCC flows, specifying a clean mapping from reception rates to subscription levels and providing a non-disruptive method for additive increase join attempts, authors build a sound multiple rate multicast congestion control scheme.

Sunil Kumar and Karan Singh [26] improved version of the AIMD approach [32] which is an equation-based single-rate MCC technique. Two principal modifications are performed.

First, each of the receiver (highest packet loss) estimates its throughput based on a equation derived according to the LIMD approach. Second, a hybrid rate-base preventive congestion control mechanism is implemented within the source. It improves in throughput; reduce rate fluctuations, RTT, and reduces the packet loss. It can be concluded that the totally throughput achieved in the case of LIMD approach is in the range of 40 to 57 kbps. But in the case of AIMD it is in the range of 32 to 50 kbps. Hence the throughput is good. On the other hand packet loss is very less.

We proposed new equation that will use in extended logarithmic increase and multiplicative decrease congestion control (ELIMD) to solve the problem in PGMCC and TFMCC. The two modifications are performed. First, each of the receiver estimate its throughput based on a new equation derived according to the ELIMD approach and second we follow the modified architecture for same.



III. PROPOSED WORK  To solve the problem of multicast congestion, Pragmatic General Multicast Congestion Control, we have used the adaptive mechanism for increasing rate or decreasing rate when congestion take place or network is underutilize. The congestion control provides the batter process for network in logarithmic increase multiplicative decrease in used. The proposed work is known as extended logarithmic increase and multiplicative decrees (ELIMD) congestion control. The contribution in paper is as follows: A. Used architecture In exiting approach PGMCC, TFMCC and LIMD sender send the data to receivers and receivers send the feedback to source via same path. So, source suffer from the implosion problem means it exhaust from feedback if there are more number of receivers. Therefore, we are using the architecture for proposed work is as shown in the figure 1. It consists of one sender also known as server and ?n? receivers. Server sends the packets     stream through IP-multicast to the receiver. If the receivers have the capability to receive all the stream of data packets, then the quality of received stream will be high. If server does not have the capability to accept all the streams send by server, then quality of received stream will be degraded. Every receiver send feedback through internet unicast to the feedback analyzer of sender.

Fig. 1. Architecture for Proposed work  According to the feedback received, the server gives the decision to the receiver whether rate should be increase or decrease.

B. Propose Algorithm We propose a modified congestion control scheme based new equation derived according to the extended logarithmic increase and multiplicative decrease (ELIMD) in congestion control approach. As we describe above, ELIMD algorithm took adaption on the basis of network condition. This scheme control congestion based on throughput which calculated by new equation. In proposed scheme, adaptive decisions are taken by source at the same node on the basis of feedback it receives from receiver nodes. When receivers return back the feedback, source take decision on the basis of received packets (throughput) to control congestion and provide the better data quality.  Main steps are following: 1. First measure the throughput according Xc to equation 2.

2. Second measure the capacity of receivers (Rc) which is  equal to capacity of resource (maximum number packets achieved at time).

3. Then compare the Xc and Rc for finding the situation of network whether it congested or no congested (under- utilized).

4. If there are some problem in network such as packet loss ore congestion occurs then send the feedback to source.

5. In case network is congested then source decrease the rate.

If it is more than a threshold value then we may say ?Network is congested or receiver achieving degraded the quality of data?.

6. In case Network is under-utilized means receiver have less incoming packets to get more quality data, it send the feedback to source  Sender sends the feedback request to receivers and receives response of feedback come from receiver. From feedback sender determine whether congestion occurred or not. In our approach, packet send by source are stored at intermediate node (node have buffer). In case packet size increases more than buffer size, packet loss will occur. Waiting time at buffer is defined as queue delay. Packet is send by source and packet are received by a node.

The new equation derived according to the extended logarithmic increase and multiplicative decrease (ELIMD) in congestion control approach. The feedback is provided by higher packet loss receiver and it is improvement of the PGMCC, TFMCC and LIMD techniques which are an equation base single rate multicast congestion control techniques. The modification are performed, first a receiver its throughput base on a new equation derived according to the ELIMD approach and second used architecture. It improves in throughput and reduces the packet loss. There is packet size 150 bytes and round trip time 300 millisecond, packet loss ratio 0.1 and there is no congestion in the network when sending rate increase by additive factor  and the rate decrease by the reduction factor at network situation while it is congested or underutilize.

Xc = e  (1+ log2)- ???????????(2) Where =L/RTT,  e: natural number, L: packet size, RTT: round trip time, : packet loss ratio, : reduction factor, : increase factor, In this paper, we have used the modified architecture and equation to control the congestion with respect to TFMCC, PGMCC and LIMD. The propose algorithm of this research work is given in next section which follow the some parameters such as Zf: congestion factor, Pn: delay for the current packet, Pn-1: delay for the current packet, Zn+1: throughput after congestion, Rc: current rate, Zn: throughput before congestion, int: Initialize.

.

A. PROPOSED ALGORITHM: ELIMD //Initialization Phase: Main()  { int packet size L = 150; int RTT  =  300; int   =  L/RTT  = 0.5; int  = 0.65; int  = 0.1:3; Calculate Xc = e (1+ log2)- While (session is start==True) { If (Xc >Rc )  // (Condition -- Congestion) //Decrease rate { Zn+1 = Zn* Zf    // Throughput calculation } Else If (Xc < Rc ) (Condition  -- Under Utilize) //Increase rate { Zn+1 = Xc +  Zn    // Throughput calculation } }     end Example: The following parameter L=150; RTT=300; =0.65;  =.5; =0.1 then the throughput obtained by the TFMCC=9.84 kbps, PGMCC=10.57 kbps, and ELIMD=11.05 kbps.

Therefore, provides the batter throughput in ELIMD.

V. CONCLUSION  The concept Multicast Congestion Control is the emerging issue which deals with exploitation of applications i.e.

videoconferencing, multicasting on the Internet. There are different issues because of different requirement of multiple receivers; it causes the problem of scalability. With the help of multi-rate approach, it provides the solution of heterogeneity.

On the other hand when the single rate is used for all the receivers then adjustment of sending rate is solved by applying the sending rate of current limiting receiver. It is basically the lowest capacity among all of receivers.

A new mechanism is developed to minimize the congestion which is based on throughput. In this proposed approach the network source adapts the network feedback. This is sent by highest packet loss receiver and increase or decrease throughput based on the propose equation. When there is no congestion source increase the throughput to utilize the network to provide the better quality of data. It basically uses the ELIMD approach. Results are simulating in NS-2 and  shows it provide the better throughput exist one.
