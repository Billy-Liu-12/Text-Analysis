Network Traffic Prediction and Result Analysis Based on Seasonal ARIMA and  Correlation Coefficient

Abstract?Traffic prediction is of significant importance for telecommunication network planning and network optimization. In this paper, the traffic series from a certain mobile network in Heilongjiang province in China is studied.

The characteristics in respect of both trend and periodicity are explored with autocorrelation function. Based on the characteristics exhibited in the traffic series, multiplicative seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA) is employed to make traffic series prediction.

Average daily traffic per month for the province as well as its every sub-region from July to December in 2009 is forecasted and compared with the actual operation data. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for one-step ahead prediction is 1.382%, and MAPE for the 6 steps is within 6%.

The prediction result is of high precision. Furthermore, the cause for the big prediction error in 2 regions is analyzed, and the appropriateness of the model is testified on the opposite aspect. This paper also provides an effective method by using correlation coefficients to analyze the cause for significant prediction errors which do not happen in time series prediction applications rarely.

I.  INTRODUCTION Traffic is a core indicator for measuring the load and use  rate of telecommunication network. Precise traffic prediction in a long period in future is of significance for network plan and optimization. In this paper, traffic data in the past several years for a whole province in China and every region are thoroughly studied, and prediction models based on multiplicative seasonal ARIMA are constructed.

The paper is organized as follows. In section one, time series prediction is introduced and several prediction techniques are given including ARIMA and its most complex style-ARIMA with multiplicative seasonal part.

Section two describes how to apply seasonal ARIMA to construct model and predict traffic, which consists of time series exploration, model identification, parameter estimation and forecasting. In section three, prediction result is analyzed. The cause for prediction error bigger than 10%  is analyzed, and the results testified the correctness of the model.

A. Time Series Prediction and ARIMA Model  Let a time series 1 2 i Nx ,x , ,x , ,x  denote observations made at equidistant time  interval ? + h, ? + 2h, , ? + ih, , ? + Nh0 0 0 0 , where  ix represents observation made at time  point 0? +ih  if we adopt 0?  as the origin and h  as the unit of time. Basically, time series prediction can be considered as a modeling issue: a model is constructed between the input and the output.

Then the model can be used to predict the future values based on the previous values.

Among the algorithms deployed in time series prediction, both ARMA (Auto-Regressive Moving Average) [1] and ARIMA (Regressive Integrated Moving Average) [2] are used most commonly. ARMA can only be used for linear and stationary time series, while ARIMA can be for non-stationary ones exhibiting homogeneity. While the time series show heterogeneous non-stationary, other algorithms such as ANN (Artificial Neural Network) [3] and SVM(Support Vector Machines) will be adopted[4]. In this paper, according to the characteristics of traffic time series, multiplicative seasonal ARIMA which is a special form of ARIMA model is employed.

Since ARIMA is a model evolving from ARMA. Next, ARMA and ARIMA will be introduced sequentially.

B. Autoregressive Moving Average Model When a time series exhibit stationarity, ARMA model  can be employed that can be represented as  1 0  p q  t i t i j t j i j  x x? ? ?? ? = =  = ?? ?   (1)  or ( ) ( )t tB x B? ? ?= (2)   DOI 10.1109/ISDEA.2010.335    DOI 10.1109/ISDEA.2010.335     In equation (2), B stands for backward shift operator,  which is defined by t t-1Bx =x . ( )B? is a stationary autoregressive operator  defined by  1 2( ) 1  p pB B B B? ? ? ?= ? ? ? ?   (3)  ?(B)  is a moving average operator defined by  1 2( ) 1 qB B B? ? ? ?= ? ? ? ?    (4)  A process defined by equation (1) or (2) is called autoregressive-moving average process of order (p, q), abbreviated as ARMA (p,q).

C. ARIMA and Seasonal ARIMA In reality, many time series are non-stationary. For those  non-stationary time series exhibiting homogeneity, we can stationalize them by differencing operation. Let 1 B? = ? denote the differencing operator so that ARIMA model can be written as  ( ) ( )d t tB x B? ? ?? =  (5) Where d is an integer representing number of  differencing operation. Thus, we can arrive at the conclusion that the model represented by equation (5) corresponds to assumption that the dth difference of the series can be represented by a stationary ARMA process. We call the process satisfying equation (5) an ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) process.

Similarly, if the non-stationary time series exhibit periodical homogeneity with period s, they can be stationalized by seasonal differencing. The seasonal  differencing operator is of the form 1 s  s B? = ? . If a time series is only of seasonal non-stationary, the model can be represented as  ( ) ( )s D sP s t Q tB x B ?? ? = ?   (6) where  2 3 1 2 3( ) 1  s s s s Ps P PB B B B B? = ?? ?? ?? ? ?? (7)   2 3  1 2 3( ) 1 s s s s Qs  Q QB B B B B? = ?? ?? ?? ? ??  (8) If a time series has both trend and seasonal part,  combining equation (7) and (8), we can get the following model  ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )S d D SP S t Q tB B Y B B? ? ?? ? ? = ? (9)  The resulting multiplicative seasonal ARIMA process is of order S(p,d,q) (P,D,Q)? .



II. TRAFFIC PREDICTION FOR A WHOLE PROVINCE  A. Exploration for the Stationarity of Daily Traffic per Month There are average daily traffic per month time series for  Heilongjiang province as a whole from January, 2005 to June, 2009, totally 54 time point represented by  ,   i=1 54ix . The original traffic series is omitted constrained by paper length. It is plotted in Figure 1, and its autocorrelation function is plotted in Figure 2.

Figure 1.  Average daily traffic per month time series(2005-1 till 2009-6)   Figure 2.  Autocorrelation function for {xi}  Figure 1 and Figure 2 show that the series for the average daily traffic per month exhibit significant increasing trend. This can also be deduced from that the autocorrelation value is significantly nonzero until lag is 12.

B. Stationalization of the original time series by differencing To stationalize a time series, differencing operation  aforementioned by ( 1)d d ?  times is often applied. For  example, differencing once means i i +1 iy =x - x . Now differencing the time series above once, and the differenced  series i{ y } is stationary by using the same exploring method aforementioned.

Figure 3.  Autocorrelation function for i{ y }  Figure 3 shows that when lag is 12 or 24, the autocorrelation coefficients are significantly nonzero, this phenomenon demonstrates that there is seasonality in the time series with period 12. This calculation result is consistent with our general knowledge: the same month in different years will exhibit strong similarity since they have the same season, the same festival and holiday, etc.

C. Periodically Differencing the Seasonal Series  Difference the derived time series i{ y }  seasonally by the equation: i i +12 iz =y -y . The autocorrelation function series for  i{ z } is plotted in Figure 4.

Figure 4.  The autocorrelation function of i{ z }  From Figure 4, it can be concluded that the derived time  series i{ z }  is already stationary. Its autocorrelation function is significantly nonzero only when the lag is 1 or 6.

D. the Prediction Process and Result for the Traffic Series of the Province From the three steps aforementioned, it will be  appropriate to approximate the average daily traffic per month with ARIMA with trend part and periodical part.

The software S-Plus developed by MathSoft corporation is used and program is developed by S-language to construct  time series model and prediction. Model the time series i{ z } with 12(p,q) (P,Q)?  where every parameter value is no more than 2. Loop all the combinations of the four parameters: p , q  , P  and  Q  and they should not all be 0 at the same time.

Select the most optimal model using AIC[5] criterion and diagnose the fitted model by checking whether the residual  is white noise. The most appropriate model for i{ z }  is 12(2 ,2 ) (1 ,0 )? . That is, the best model for the original traffic  series is 1 2( 2 ,1 ,2 ) ( 2 ,1 ,1 )? .The model is represented by: 2 12 12 24  1 2 1 2  2 12 1 2 1  (1 )(1 )(1 )(1 )  (1 )(1 ) t  t  B B B B B B x  B B B  ? ? ? ? ?  ? ? ? ? ?? ??  = ? ? ??   (10)  Estimate the parameters in equation (10) using MLE (Maximal Likeliness Estimation) and the result is shown in Table I.

Employing the same process aforementioned to model  the traffic time series for each region and make prediction.

Limited to the length of the paper, the traffic series for each region is not listed here.



III. EVALUATION AND ANALYSIS OF THE PREDICTION RESULT OF THE TRAFFIC SERIES  A. Evaluation of the prediction result for the traffic Evaluate prediction values for the whole province and  each region in July till December of 2009, and the result is shown in Table III.

Theoretically, there are several causes for big error: inappropriate model, noises in the training data, and the characteristic of actual data is not the in line with the history data. Next, I will analyze the two regions in Table IV.

For the region of YCH, the prediction error for the average daily traffic per month on November and December are rather big. Firstly, it will be judged if the actual values are accordant with the history value. The conclusion is negative. The analyzing method is using correlation coefficient [6].

The correlation coefficient is a statistical variable to estimate the correlation between two random variables. Let  correlation coefficient be denoted by ( , )X Y? , where X and Y  are the two random variables  to be studied. The  formulation to compute  ( , )X Y?  using X and Y based on a sample containing  n points is as follows:  Where  2 2  1 1  ( ) ( ) ( , )  ( ) ( )  n  i i i  n n  i i i i  x x y y X Y  x x y y  ?  ? ?  =  ? ?  = =  ? ? =  ? ?  ?  ? ?   (11)  Firstly examine if the data in January to June in 2008 are likely as the data in the same period in 2009. The correlation coefficient for the two time series is 0. 962 , and this similarity can also be seen from the Figure 7. This showed that the traffic data in the first half year of 2008 and 2009 obeyed the same rule.

Forecasting future values by using history value is under the hypothesis: future values obey the same rule with the history values. But explore the values in October till December in 2008 and 2009, and find that they are not similar- the correlation coefficient value is - 0. 597 .  From Figure 8, it can also be seen that the two time series have different trend.

Figure 5.  Comparison of first half year in 2008 and 2009   Figure 6.  Comparison of last three monthsr in 2008 and 2009  We can arrive at the conclusion that: the big forecast error for the region of YCH in November and December is because that the actual operation situation in 2009 is not the same as before, not because of inappropriate forecast model or history data with big  noise.The similar situation exists in the region of HG.



IV. CONCLUSIONS Traffic forecast is an important function in   network  management. It makes significant sense for network planning and optimization to forecast the traffic in a long period in the future. In this paper, the traffic series for a province of a certain mobile network operator is studied, Based on the characteristics exhibited in the traffic series, multiplicative seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA) is employed to make traffic series prediction. The mean average percentage error (MAPE) for one-step ahead prediction is 1.382%, and MAPE for the 6 steps are all less than 6%. The prediction result is of high precision. Furthermore, the cause for the large prediction error in 2 regions is analyzed by using correlation coefficients, and the appropriateness of the model is testified on the opposite aspect. This paper also provides with an effective method by using correlation coefficients to analyze the reason for significant prediction errors which does not happen in time series prediction applications rarely.

Certainly this correlation coefficient method is mainly useful for time series exhibiting linear characteristic and seasonal feature.
