A Novel Approach to Find the Satisfaction Pattern of Customers in

Abstract? Nowadays, many studies of the discovery of needs and feelings of the hotel customers are not only around before-booking period, but also do not consider the privacy of customers completely. While the best period of studies of this knowledge are after the booking took place, there are two major problems for its unpopular: one is personal privacy, the other is not having a scientific and valuable approach. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to deal with the above existing problems. We employ intuitionistic fuzzy set, ?-cuts, and Apriori algorithm to discovery the knowledge of needs and feelings of customers under an anonymous way. The approach is expatiated under different ? by an example. And The yielded pattern and association rules have taken to the cooperative hotel more effects than before. So the approach is provable and valuable.



I. INTRODUCTION  D UE to the high costs that are typically involved with  investments in the hotel industry, a lot of stud-  ies[1][2][3][4]have been made in these years to reveal some  useful information about customers?needs and feelings. But  they are around before-booking period. However, they have  many drawbacks; for example, when the customer neither  is familiar with the decisions nor with the hotel chain.

Avoidance of some fault, they will chose not to live in this  hotel. Even some of these studies find some useful pattern  about customers. They often leak personal private data unin-  tentionally. The best period to find the interesting pattern of  customers in hotel is after the booking took place[5][6], but  the discovery of needs and feelings of the customers after the  booking took place has not been a major research issue so  far. There are two main problems for its unpopularity. One  is the personal data privacy to be concerned, the other is not  having a scientific and valuable approach to be used. In this  paper, we propose a novel approach.We employ intuitionistic  fuzzy set, ?-cuts, and Apriori algorithm under an anonymous  way to settle the above problems and achieve the following  purposes:  ? The discovery of needs and feelings of the customers  after the booking took place under an anonymous way.

? Avoiding the signals that sent by customers are noise  and confusing by classification.

? Pattern of customers?needs and feelings means a strong  competitive advantage for hotel management.

? The customers who belong to the different categories,  their choice and preferring are not the same.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

Section II describes the prepared work to this approach and  technique we employ. Section III explicates the whole steps  and approach by an example. And reports the experiment  results. Section IV concludes our work and discusses future  research.



II. PREPARED WORK  A. Intuitionistic Fuzzy Set  Intuitionistic fuzzy set theory(IFS for short)[6] is an ex-  tension of fuzzy set theory that defies the claim that from the  fact that an element x belongs to a given degree ?A(x) to a fuzzy set A,naturally follows that x should not belong to A  to the extent 1-?A(x), an assertion implicit in the concept of a fuzzy set.On the contrary, an IFS assigns to each element  x of the universe both a degree of membership ?A(x) and one of non-membership vA(x) such that  ?A(x) + vA(x) ? 1 (1) thus relaxing the enforced duality ?A(x) = 1 ? vA(x) from fuzzy set theory. Obivously,when ?A(x) + vA(x) = 1 for all elements of universe, the traditional fuzzy set concept is  recovered.

B. ?-cuts and Attributes  We want to exhibit an element x ? X that typically belongs to a fuzzy set A, we may demand its membership  value to be greater than some threshold ? ?[0,1]. The ordinary set of each elements is the ?-cut A? of A.

A? = {x ? X, ?A(x) ? ?} (2) The above equation is employed in this paper. one also  defines the strong ?-cut  A? = {x ? X, ?A(x) > ?} (3) The membership function of a fuzzy set can be expressed in  terms of the characteristic function of its ?-cuts according  to the formula.

uA(?) =  { 1 iff x ? A?; 0 otherwise.

(4)  Customers profiling provides a basis for marketers and  decision-makers to communicate with existing customers  in order to offer them better services and retaining them.

According to[5]-[7] and the characteristic of the customers      and the real condition of hotel,we construct the database  using the attributes,which are shown in the following table  (LAN is Local Area Network for short).

TABLE I  ATTRIBUTES  Attribute Attribute  Internet service(IS) Wireless LAN (WL) Airport shuttle(AS) Fitness center(FC)  Values for money (VM) Staff service (SS) Clean(C) Restaurant(R)  We use the satisfaction and dissatisfaction degree to ex-  press this attributes separately. Satisfaction and dissatisfac-  tion are a multi-faceted concept. It can be full or partial. And  it depends on the customers or depends on the purpose,etc.

Since satisfaction and dissatisfaction may be a matter of  degree, we use a number i between 0 and 1 to express the  degree. In our approach,0 corresponds to total absence of  satisfaction.Roughly speaking, the customers are completely  dissatisfied. Satisfaction and dissatisfaction degree do not  have to sum up to 1. Omitting the restriction would result  in allowing inconsistency. As a result, these are represented  by an IFS.Here,we use IFS to reflect customers?needs and  feelings objectively,because customers may not experience  all services the hotel provides. So customers have no reason  to be satisfied, but also no reason to be dissatisfied.

C. Data Mining and Privacy Preserving  Data mining combines the statistic and artificial intel-  ligence to find out the rules that are contained in the  data,letters,and figures and soon by sorting and analyz-  ing[12].There are many methods of data mining includ-  ing classification,estimation,prediction,clustering,and affinity  grouping. Among these,affinity grouping can discover the  high frequency pattern and discover which things appear  frequently and simultaneously.

The central idea of data mining for customer relationship  management is that data from the past that contains infor-  mation that will be useful in the future. It works because  customer behaviors captured in corporate data are not ran-  dom, but reflect the differing needs, preferences, propensities,  and treatments of customers. The goal of data mining is to  find patterns in historical data that shed light on those needs,  preferences, and propensities. The task is made difficult by  the fact that the patterns are not always strong, and the signals  sent by customers are noisy and confusing[13].

Data mining techniques are used to find patterns in large  databases of information. But sometimes these patterns can  reveal sensitive information about the data holder or individ-  uals whose information are the subject of the patterns. The  notion of privacy-preserving data mining is to identify and  disallow such revelations as evident in the kinds of patterns  learned using traditional data mining techniques. In the paper,  we find the interesting pattern under an anonymous way in  order to protect the customers? privacy effectively.

D. Steps  The steps of this approach:  ? Divide he customers into different groups according to  the different types of customers.

? Construct the database.

? Suppose ?-cuts to calculate the fuzzy degree of every  attribute.

? Utilize ?-cuts to get the item sets,and calculate the  appearing times of every item.

? Employ Apriori algorithm to find the relative pattern  and form the association rules.



III. AN EXAMPLE  In real application, the customers are classified into six  separate categories, they are solo travelers, young couples,  mature couples, families with young children, families with  older children, Groups. Here we just take 10 records of young  couples an example to explicate the whole approach and  procedure, and find the satisfaction pattern under different  ?.

A. Approach Explanation  Step 1: We list the records according to the above.All  the records are shown in below. ( S denotes the satisfaction  degree,D denotes the dissatisfaction degree.)  TABLE II  RECORDS  IS WL AS FC VM SS C R  SD SD SD SD SD SD SD SD  0.70.2 0.30.7 0.01.0 0.50.3 0.50.2 0.60.1 0.50.3 0.50.2 0.60.1 0.00.8 1.00.0 0.90.1 0.40.6 0.50.2 0.50.5 0.50.5 0.30.4 0.60.4 0.60.4 0.80.1 0.80.1 0.60.3 0.40.5 0.60.3 0.60.2 0.50.3 0.50.5 0.30.4 0.60.3 0.50.2 0.70.3 0.80.1 0.60.3 0.50.4 0.50.1 0.50.2 0.50.1 0.60.4 0.50.4 0.60.2 0.40.6 0.01.0 1.00.0 0.60.3 0.50.4 0.60.4 0.60.4 0.80.1 0.30.7 0.50.2 0.50.2 0.50.4 0.50.5 0.70.2 0.50.1 0.50.3 0.70.2 0.40.6 0.30.6 0.60.4 0.70.2 0.60.3 0.50.4 0.80.1 0.50.5 0.60.3 0.80.2 1.00.0 0.30.6 0.50.2 0.70.3 0.60.4 0.90.1 0.30.5 0.40.6 0.80.2 0.60.3 0.70.3 0.50.2 0.50.3  Step 2: Here we use ?-cuts to transform the above ta-  ble,and here we suppose ?=0.5, 0.8 separately.In the follow-  ing tables, A1 denotes the satisfaction of IS, A2 denotes the  dissatisfaction of IS, and so on.

Step 3: Choosing the satisfaction attribute whose value is  1,then getting the transaction tables.

Step 4: Calculate the appearing times of satisfaction item  when ?=0.5, 0.8. And the appearing times of every item are  shown later.

Step 5: We use Apriori algorithm to find the frequent  item sets. Let the minimum support count be 8. It is  obviously to find the frequent item set existing when ?=0.5.

There is no large item set when ?=0.8. The resulting set is  denoted L,thus,we have L={D1F1,D1H1,F1H1,D1F1H1}, and the minimum confidence threshold is,say, 95%. Then     the association rules are shown in the last table.

So we can get the following pattern from the above  example:  ? If the customers satisfy the Fitness center,then they will  satisfy the Staff service.

? If the customers satisfy the Fitness center,then they will  satisfy the Restaurant.

? If the customers satisfy the Restaurant,then they will  satisfy the Staff service.

? If the customers satisfy the Fitness center and Restau-  rant,then they will satisfy the Staff service.

? If the customers satisfy the Fitness center and Staff  service,then they will satisfy the Restaurant.

? If the customers satisfy the Fitness center,then they will  satisfy the Staff service and Restaurant.

Experiments  We have cooperated with a hotel to test our approach  since 2006, and yielded some interesting and useful pattern  and association rules. From the experiment results, even  though to different categories under the same ?, the yielded  association rules and pattern are different. So the valuable  information have important roles to the decision-makers of  hotel. After that, these valuable pattern and yielded rules of  customers have taken a strong competitive advantage for the  hotel management.



IV. CONCLUSIONS  We study the interesting pattern of customers in one  hotel by proposing a novel approach,we employ IFS,?-  cuts,and Apriori algorithm to discovery the knowledge of  needs and feelings of customers after the booking took  place under an anonymous way.Compared to [1][2][3][4],our  approach has successfully protected the customers?personal  data privacy and achieved some gratifying results from the  experiments.Certainly,the approach is not limited in hotel,we  will study further in the long run to enlarge its application  fields. So the study is provable and valuable.
