The Personality of Venues  Places and the Five-Factors (?Big Five?) Model of Personality

Abstract?Venues are often described by their type and characteristics, while their level of appreciation by users is indicated through a score (star rating). However the judgement on a particular venue by an individual may more influenced by the individual?s experience and personality. In psychology, the five-factor model of personality, or ?Big Five? model, describes an individual?s personality in terms of openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism. This work explores the notion of ?personality of a venue? by reference to personality traits research in psychology. To determine the personality of a venue, keywords are extracted from reviews of venues, and matched to terms indicative of personality traits dimensions. The work is completed with a human experiment where participants qualify venues according to a set of personality descriptors.

Correlations are found between the human annotators and the automated extraction approach.

Keywords? Five Factor Model, place, personality, reviews, recommendation

I. INTRODUCTION Location based Web services have become popular among  Internet users, who can leave reviews, or ?tips?, for venues they visit. Unlike edited expert reviews, which may be structured according to comprehensive, consistent and objective checklists of features, user contributed reviews are generally short texts reflecting the ?perception? or ?feeling? of a place, usually accompanied by a rating (stars). The aim of this research is to capture this underlying ?feeling? of a place, or personality of a venue, in a way related to personality research in human psychology. This representation of a place that depicts it as a projection of (different) users? perceptions is in line with the notion of ?sense of place?, which emphasises the characteristics that make a geographical location special or unique from a human point of view [1].

Personality research in psychology is based on the so-called lexical hypothesis, stating that the personality characteristics that are most important in peoples' lives will eventually become a part of their language, and that more important personality characteristics are more likely to be encoded into language as a single word. The lexical hypothesis was invoked to derive five broad domains or dimensions of personality, where personality descriptors of individuals cluster together after factor analysis. Dimensions of this Five Factor Model (FFM), also called ?Big 5? personality traits, are usually represented by roman numerals (I-V). For mnemonic purposes the acronym OCEAN is also used. OCEAN stands for  descriptions of the five dimensions as Openness (inventive or curious vs. consistent or cautious), Conscientiousness (efficient or organized vs. easy-going or careless), Extraversion (outgoing or energetic vs. solitary or reserved), Agreeableness (friendly or compassionate vs. cold or unkind) and Neuroticism (sensitive or nervous vs. secure or confident). According to the FFM, everyone?s personality can be described with some level of confidence along these dimensions.

The research presented here assumes that venues can also be described using human personality dimensions, due to the personality of the individuals that frequent the venue, or because of characteristics of the venues. This usage is also embedded in language, which sometimes uses the same vocabulary to describe place and human personality. For example an ?arty? place is expected to have a higher Openness (O) value than a ?traditional? pub. A nightclub would be expected to score high on Extraversion (E), while a ?quiet? coffee place should score lower on that personality dimension.

An accurate qualification of venues according to their personality should provide insight for better place recommendation, as well as constitute a step towards the computational capture of the ?sense of place?.

The approach presented here is based on reviews collected from location based Web services. Reviews are parsed and matched to adjectives characteristic of personality trait dimensions. A human experiment is presented which is used as proof of concept as well as ground truth for the automatic generation of venue personality values. The next section presents related work in the fields of personality research, place recommendation and opinion mining. Section III presents the personality related adjectives and results of previous personality research, which are used for venue characterisation.

Section IV describes the experimental setting used to acquire data on venue personality from participants, and the results of a survey. It then presents the automated extraction approach using reviews. Finally Section V concludes and describes future work.



II. RELATED WORK This research shares similar goals with opinion mining,  although with different dimensions of interest. It also contributes to personality research applied to other subjects than humans, and contributes to the field of place recommendation.

DOI 10.1109/COMGEO.2013.12    DOI 10.1109/COMGEO.2013.12     Opinion mining is concerned with applying computational methods for the detection and measurement of opinion, sentiment and subjectivity in text [2]. Particularly, sentiment analysis is concerned with the automated detection of negative or positive sentiment in natural text, while affective computing is concerned with the detection of human emotions such as fear, anger or humour. In both cases, the dimensions of interest are different from the ones studied in this research. Moreover, sentiment analysis applied to venues through reviews may be seen as redundant, since the review score already conveys a positive or negative judgment. This research may therefore be considered as an extension of sentiment analysis to additional dimensions of psychological interest.

Beside humans, personality traits research has been applied to non-human animals [3]. To the best of our knowledge, this constitutes the only extension of personality traits research beyond human personality, with no attempts towards other realms such as everyday objects, buildings or places. The research presented here applies personality research to geographic entities. If extending personality traits theory to non-living structures may be controversial, as it could be argued it only applies in a metaphorical way, it also constitutes a new field of investigation potentially useful to future place recommender systems.

Tourism recommender systems have been developed to suggest venues personalized according to the user querying the system. Such venues can be generic points of interest, restaurants/cafes, or hotels (see [4] for a survey). However, the criteria used for recommendation can be described as external, such as price, cuisine, and location, as opposed to personality related recommendation. The present work can use the personality of a user (a tourist) to recommend the venue most adapted to his or her psychological profile. Beyond tourism, with the advent of mobile devices and location based services that can monitor our geographical positions in real time or at regular check points (?check-ins?), mobile and online services related to places are even more popular. They have evolved from an initial adaptation of online maps and navigators towards services more oriented to provide reviews and personalised recommendations such as Yelp1 and Qype2, to others that combine location and user mobility with a social networking component, for example Foursquare3, Flickr4, and Google+ Local5. These services have evolved towards a place representation that is more related to the individual needs of users, regardless of his tourism or business needs, with users being at a particular location at a particular time often making use of tags, annotations and other user generated content which in turn informs recommendation [5]. User generated content, in the form of reviews, is used in this research to extract the personality of places.

III. KEYWORD EXTRACTION We follow a ?bag of words? approach in which both venues  and personality dimensions are represented by unigrams (individual words). Unigrams describing places are extracted from online sources providing reviews for those places, while keywords (adjectives) representing dimensions of personality are gathered from psychology literature [6]. The next sections describe the extraction and organisation of the data.

A. Venues Keywords Reviews of venues are extracted from various location  services using their respective APIs, or through text ?scraping? techniques. The sources used for review extraction are: Foursquare, Google Places, Yelp, Qype and Yell6.

Review text was stripped of punctuation and stopwords, uncapitalised, and part of speech (POS) tagged to filter verbs and adverbs. A negation detection algorithm is applied to the list of words to tag adjectives used in a negative sense. The algorithm is a modified version of the one presented in [2], itself inspired by NegEx [7]. The algorithm was modified to ignore so called pseudo negations (such as introduced by 'no increase', 'no wonder', 'no change', 'not cause', 'not only', 'not necessarily') because they were resulting in too many false positive in the reviews corpus. Also ?nothing? was added to the so-called prenegation set used by the algorithm, in order to identify sentences such as ?there?s nothing special or exciting about?? as negatives.

B. Inventory of Personality Adjectives Here we describe the inventory of personality adjectives  presented by Saucier and Goldberg in [6]. The final 435- adjective inventory was obtained in their work by annotating personality related adjectives with familiarity ratings, in order to filter out the least familiar English trait personality descriptors. The resulting list of familiar adjectives was then used in that study to characterise the personality of a large sample of individuals (N=899). Following principal component analysis Saucier and Goldberg identified five clusters corresponding to five personality dimensions. Correlation scores for a selection of adjectives are given in TABLE I.

The mapping between dimensions I to V and the OCEAN traits characterisation is given in TABLE II.  IV is usually inversed to represent neuroticism (IV-), i.e. high on IV- corresponds to low emotional stability. Following this correspondence, the adjective reasonable strongly correlates (0.38) with the OCEAN A dimension (Agreeableness) as well as with C (Conscientiousness) at 0.25, while friendly also correlates with A (0.37) but even more with E (Extraversion) with 0.39 as well as negatively (-0.17) with N (Neuroticism) and Openness (-0.16).



IV. MATCHING APPROACH To assign dimensions of personality to a venue, terms  obtained from the review extraction that we performed were matched to the list of familiar personality adjectives. The ground truth was obtained from a human experiment which task consisted in selecting adjectives for a venue, from a subset   6 http://www.yell.com/     of the Saucier and Goldberg familiar personality adjectives that was relevant to the type of the venue. In the following sections we describe the human experiment followed by the automated matching approach.

TABLE I.  EXAMPLES OF PERSONALITY ADJECTIVES WITH FFM CORRELATION    TABLE II.  SELECTED SUBSETS OF ADJECTIVES FOR VENUE CATEGORY   A. Human Experiment  The experiment consisted of an annotation task where participants were asked to qualify known venues with adjectives. The task consisted of two steps. In a first step, for each venue, the participants were asked to state whether or not they knew the venue and have visited it. In a second step participants were asked to select adjectives relevant to the venues they knew, from a presented set. The following sub- sections describe the places chosen, the presented set of adjectives, the experimental setting, the matching approach and results.

1) Place Selection   12 venues were selected in Cardiff, Wales, UK according to the following criteria:  ? Review availability: selected venues had reviews from at least two Web sources,  ? Global diversity: the places were divided into 4 categories, or types, with T = {cafe, club, pub, restaurant} and 3 venues of each type,  ? Category diversity: in each category not all venues had the same characteristics,  ? Expert knowledge:  we selected venues that were most likely known to the participants.

The chosen venues, accompanied with a brief description, are listed in TABLE III.

TABLE III.  VENUES SELECTED FOR THE EXPERIMENT   2) Adjectives Selection   In order to limit the human effort required to complete the  task, the list of 435 familiar personality adjectives was filtered according to common collocations extracted from the Google books corpus available from http://byu.edu. Collocations were mined for adjectives preceding a type name, i.e. one of {cafe, club, pub, restaurant}. Then the resulting list of adjectives was matched to the 435 familiar adjectives.

For reasons of sense ambiguity some lists of correlations were larger than others, with keywords not immediately relevant to geographic venues. For example the type club had adjectives such as charitable or dominant, not immediately related to a dancing club or a nightclub, but probably more to a club as a group of individuals. Some participants complained about these terms as well as for the lack of negative terms in some cases. However, no manual filtering was done on the matched adjectives in order to preserve the objective nature of the task. The selected subset of adjectives for each type, as well as descriptive statistics regarding the correlations of the set of adjectives to personality dimensions, are presented in TABLE IV.

The minimum and maximum correlation for every dimension as well as the mean indicate the range of choice offered to the participant for a venue of a given type. In a few cases, such as for the category pub the range on dimension II (Agreeableness) does not allow for negative values. This is a limitation of the experiment, which may however reflect the fact that most venues tend to favour agreeableness, and that in reviews and other place descriptions, from which collocations are extracted, agreeableness terms are overrepresented.

3) Experimental Setting   21 anonymous participants with knowledge of Cardiff completed the survey. Each venue was known by an average of 11.75 participants, each participant knowing an average of 6.71 venues. To address the small number of participants for some venues we used Wilson?s statistical score interval to estimate the number of checks for an adjective with 85% probability, and selected only adjectives checked by at least 20% of participants.

SELECTED SUBSETS OF ADJECTIVES FOR VENUE CATEGORY     Given the adjectives selected, OCEAN dimensions for venues are calculated first by averaging the correlations of the adjectives selected by more than 20% of users, for a venue, then by multiplying the resulting vector by 5, corresponding to the desired range of each dimension (?????), and finally by adding 2.5 (half of the range) to the result.

Formally, for every adjective ?? ? selected for a venue ? from the type?s subset of adjectives ?, the number of selected adjectives  , the all-ones vector, and the corresponding correlation vector ??  as given for each adjective in [6], the resulting OCEAN survey vector ???  is obtained following to (1).

??? ? ? ? ???? ?  ? ?? ? ?? ? ???? (1)  4) Survey results   The results of the survey are presented in TABLE V.  With OCEAN results, number of participants knowing the venue, and average number of adjectives used.

The following comments may be made on the results:  ? V01, the independent coffee place, ranks the highest in O, due to the use of adjectives such as ?intellectual? and ?sophisticated? (0.5 and 0.18 correlation on O, respectively).

? V02, a traditional pub, ranks low on O, due to the use of adjectives such as ?simple? and ?traditional? (-0.45 and -0.36 on O, respectively)  ? all clubs rank above 4 on E, while all other types of venues are below.

? pubs rank higher on E than caf?s, but only on average, with V10 and V13, both pubs having live music, contrasting with V02, a traditional chain owned pub.

? Neuroticism is constantly below average, which suggests that venue owners don?t encourage negative emotions such as fear and anxiety.

The list of adjectives used for every venue is given in TABLE VI.

TABLE V.  SURVEY RESULTS     B. Reviews Matching The approach taken to match familiar personality adjectives  to venues differs slightly from the experiment, due to some reviews being short, and therefore not providing an exhaustive description of the personality related aspects of the venue, or a type related one. Therefore, the full list of familiar adjectives was used, rather than type correlated adjectives, and keywords were stemmed to encourage more matches.

The negation algorithm is applied to venues keywords, to obtain a negation marker (1 or -1) for each term. Venues keywords extracted from reviews as well as familiar adjectives are stemmed using the Porter stemmer. Stemmed review terms are then matched to the list of 435 stemmed familiar adjectives.

In case of a match, the correlation values of the matching adjective is added, possibly negated if a negation has been detected. The resulting sum is then averaged, multiplied by the range (5), and added to the average value for a dimension (2.5).

?"? ? ? ? #$?%??  ? ? ?? ? ?? ? ???? (2)  1) Results of automatic matching  Results of automated reviews matching are presented in TABLE VII.

The following comments may be made on the results:  ? V01, the independent coffee place, is still ranking high in O, but is only 4th position. This is due to an abundance of agreeableness terms present in reviews, such as ?friendly? (stem: ?friendli?), which also affect the O dimension (-0.16 on O).

? V02 also ranks high in O due to the term ?reasonable?, qualifying quality and prices, and correlating with O (0.12) and with A (0.38)  ? Clubs rank the highest on E, although V53 ranks the highest, due to a majority of ?friendly? (0.39 on E)  ? Neuroticism is constantly below average, as in the survey.

The list of stemmed adjectives used in reviews of each venue is given in TABLE VIII.

2) Evaluation and Discussion  To characterise the personality of a venue in a human- friendly way, the OCEAN acronym was used with the characters reordered according to dimension values, in decreasing order. For example an open and extrovert place can have ?OEACN? as profile, compared to an agreeable but not very open place which would be an ?ACENO?. This ocean signature was used to compare results from the survey to results of the automated process. The two signature strings were compared using the Hamming string distance, which counts matching characters in two strings of equal length.

TABLE VII.  AUTOMATED MATCHING RESULTS    TABLE VIII.  ORDERED LIST OF ADJECTIVE STEMS EXTRACTED FROM REVIEWS, WITH NUMBER OF USE     Although the average distance is 3.9 (out of a maximum of 5), the first dimension matches 8 times out of 12, suggesting that the automated method provides good results to determine the most important characteristic of a venue.

For every venue, we also calculated a mean error for a venue according to (3):  &'? ? (??")*??)?+  , (3)  When averaging the error across the sample, we obtained a value of 0.16, with a maximum value of 0.2, and a minimum value of 0.12, suggesting that, on average, the algorithm matches human evaluation with an error lower than 20%.

Some of the imprecision found in comparing survey and automated matching results is certainly due to the difficulty of accurately parsing reviews. For example, Greggs (V52), a chain owned bakery, appears in the automated process as an ?exciting?, ?imaginative? and ?independent? place due to reviews sentences such as:  ID V01 V02 V04 V10 V13 V21 V27 V33 V52 V53 V55 V57  Adjectives selected (20% of participants at 85% confidence)  energetic, rude, social, rough active  simple, conventional, reasonable, efficient, modest, reliable agreeable, traditional  warm, informal, pleasant, friendly, casual casual, reasonable, friendly, independent, conventional  warm, friendly, pleasant, casual, informal, intellectual, quiet, sophisticated simple, informal, casual, traditional  informal, casual, warm, pleasant, pretentious traditional, pleasant, warm, friendly, informal, hearty, casual  informal, pleasant, casual, friendly social, rude, energetic, active  ID venue name O C E A N V01 A shot in the dark 2.66 2.85 2.94 3.41 1.86 V02 Ernest Willow 2.71 2.96 2.54 3.43 2.09 V04 Starbuck Queen St 2.39 3.26 2.89 3.71 2.09 V10 Pen and Wig 2.5 3.13 2.94 3.8 1.82 V13 Promised Land 2.43 2.91 2.78 3.81 2.06 V21 Glam 2.66 2.64 3.03 2.98 2.38 V27 Oceana 2.55 2.69 2.97 3.34 2.25 V33 Pulse 2.56 2.62 3.2 2.94 2.18 V52 Greggs 2.94 2.97 1.73 2.43 1.67 V53 Venus Kebabs 2.25 2.74 3.32 3.45 2.22 V55 Costa Coffee 2.77 3.08 2.87 2.77 2.05 V57 Balti King 2.45 2.85 2.82 2.95 1.53  restaurant cafe restaurant  pub club club club restaurant  venue type cafe pub cafe pub   0.5   1.5   2.5   3.5   O  C  E  A  N  ID V01 V02 V04 V10 V13 V21 V27 V33 V52 V53 V55 V57  independ (2), kind (1), depend (1), rude (1), relax (1),? reason (1), unsympathet (1), friendli (1)  reason (10), relax (8), friendli (7), gener (4), kind (4), pretenti (3), sophist (3), ...

In all these sentences the negative use of an adjective has been wrongly interpreted as a positive by the particular variant of the NegEx algorithm used.



V. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK This work constitutes a first attempt at a qualification of  venues according to their personality using an automated matching method between reviews and personality related adjectives. It provides both an experimental approach of venue personality annotation by human subjects, as well as an automated venue personality extraction approach based on reviews.

We demonstrated that reviews provide a reliable source of personality related adjectives, matching human evaluation in several aspects, notably the main personality dimension of a venue and the range of personality values. Further work includes extending and modifying the evaluation approach, a better handling of negation, and possibly an evaluation using personality tests of users of the venue.

A larger scale evaluation of the automated approach is needed, requiring more human experiment samples. The principal difficulty for such an evaluation is that participants are required to have knowledge of the venue. A possibility to explore is to distribute questionnaires in a venue, which would ensure the punters already know the place. This outreach effort could be combined with the administration of a FFM personality test for every respondent. The adjective list for  every venue could be adapted by using negatives or a Likert scale for each, which will ensure a wider range of personality is available for a type of venue.

Further work on the improvement of the negation detection algorithm would increase the quality of the automated results.

However it is unclear whether negation detection algorithms exist which could accurately address the examples presented above.
