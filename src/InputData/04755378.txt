Enterprise portal personalization: Direct and indirect end-user effects, and  the moderating effects of gender

Abstract  Enterprise portals offer rich functionality for end- user personalization, but few studies have been conducted on the end-user effects of this feature. This article presents a study of end-user effects of personalization, using the combined technology acceptance model (TAM) and the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) as a research framework. We propose that personalization indirectly affects end-users? intentions through effects on ease of use, usefulness, attitude and behaviour control. In addition, it may have a direct effect on end-users? intentions to use enterprise portals that is not mediated by the variables of the combined TAM/TPB-model. Because previous studies have found gender differences in the use of personalization, we also propose that the effects of personalization are moderated by gender. To test these propositions, a study of the effects of enterprise portal personalization in a large Norwegian government- owned enterprise is reported. Results from applying structural equation modelling show that personalization has a significant effect on perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude, and perceived behavioural control, but no direct effect on end-users?  intentions to use the enterprise portal.

Furthermore, the results show that the effects of personalization are moderated by gender. The results have implications for enterprise portal designers, for IS-managers and for further research on personalization of information systems in general.

1. Introduction   Indicating that "Personalization, ...., has been recognized as an important concept in IS research" [1, p. 348], several articles have recently been published in leading information systems (IS) journals on the subject [1, 2, 3, 4]. Personalization is expected to "play a significant role in enhancing its customers? shopping experience" [4, p. 425] and Tam and Ho suggest that "personalizing ...empowers firms to deliver customer  value and to achieve profitable growth" [2, p. 272].

What is characteristic of these recent studies, however, is that they have been conducted in customer portal or web-site contexts.

Enterprise portals also offer rich functionality for end-user personalization. Adapting the definition of Smith [5] to organizational contexts, Scheepers [6] suggests that: ?An enterprise portal should provide members of the organization with access to relevant internally and externally sourced information, via a (Web-based) gateway which can be customized and personalized to meet individuals? specific information requirements? [6, p. 636]. As seen from this definition, personalization is a central feature of enterprise portals, suggesting that the recent interest in personalization in the IS-literature should also be extended to cover enterprise portal studies.

Several definitions of personalization have been given in the IS-literature [e.g. 4, 7]. Here, we apply the definition by Blom [8] suggesting that personalization is ?a process that changes the functionality, interface, information content, or distinctiveness of a system to increase its personal relevance to an individual? [8, p.

313].

Personalization can be performed either by the end- user (explicit personalization) or by the system (implicit personalization) [9]. A system with explicit personalization typically enables the end-user to change the content, layout, interface, or the functionality of the system. Implicit personalization is conducted in various ways: Profile/group-based personalization, in which the personalization is based on an individual profile, membership or role; behaviour based personalization, in which the personalization is based on click-streams or end-user behaviour; and, finally, collaborative-based personalization, in which the personalization is based on similar end-users? behaviour. For enterprise portals, the combination of explicit and profile/group-based personalization is most common.

Enterprise portal applications come preconfigured to utilize these personalization features, but the IS-      literature offers relatively little assistance to IS- managers in how these features can be utilized to stimulate adoption and manage end-user behaviour.

Thus, empirical studies of personalization effects in organizational contexts are important in filling this knowledge gap.

From human computer interaction (HCI) literature, Oulasvirta and Blom [10] found that personalization affects end-users? engagement, performance, persistence, identity, social acceptance, and social status. Still, they concluded that personalization in organizational contexts has attained little attention in the HCI-domain, and suggest further empirical research. This article represents an effort in this direction, empirically investigating the effects of enterprise portal personalization on traditional antecedents of end-user behaviour.

In the personalization literature, Wells [11] found that men and women personalized differently and for different reasons. Thus, it is likely that the effects of personalization also differ systematically by gender.

By investigating these issues empirically, this article further contributes to a better understanding of personalization as an instrument in stimulating and promoting specific end-user behaviour.

In the next section we present our research model and hypotheses. In section three, the applied method is presented. In section four, our findings are presented, and finally, we give a brief summary of conclusions and limitations, and suggest implications of the results.

2 Model and hypotheses   In a recent special issue of the Journal of the  Association of Information Systems, technology acceptance research was discussed, and two recommendations were given [12]. One was to include the variables of the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) [13] in studies of technology acceptance. The other was to look at IT-artefacts as antecedents of the constructs of the technology acceptance model (TAM) [14]. This study takes the recommendations from this discussion seriously by applying the combined TAM/TPB model [15] as a research framework, and by focusing personalization as one of the potential antecedents of the constructs in the combined TAM/TPB-model.

From numerous technology acceptance studies, we know that that the TPB constructs subjective norm and perceived behaviour control (PBC), as well as the TAM constructs perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and attitude towards use, are important determinants of end-users? intentions to use information systems in organizational contexts [e.g.

14, 15]. In this study we focus personalization as one of the antecedents of these variables rather than the effects of these variables on intentions per se. Thus, we investigate how personalization affects end-user behaviour indirectly through its effects on ease of use, usefulness, attitude and PBC. Because it is difficult to find theoretical arguments for an effect of personalization on subjective norm, personalization effects on this variable is not focused here. It is, however, included in the combined TAM/TPB model that is used as a research framework for this study.

Furthermore, we suggest that in addition to its mediating effects, personalization may also affect intentions to use enterprise portals directly.

TPB suggests that an individual?s intention to behave is an antecedent of actual behaviour, and that attitude towards the behaviour, subjective norm and PBC are antecedents of this intention. Based on the TPB and on the theory of reasoned action (TRA) [16], Davis introduced the TAM-model [14]. In this model, perceived ease of use and usefulness are used to explain both attitudes towards use and behavioural intentions to use information systems. In this study, we use the combined TAM/TPB model as a framework for investigating personalization effects. Thus we do not discuss all causal paths of the combined TAM/TPB- model, but focus the effects of personalization and the causal paths of the combined TAM/TPB that are related to the hypothesized effects of personalization.

In figure 1, our applied version of the combined TAM/TPB-model is illustrated. Potential direct and indirect effects of personalization are illustrated by the paths from perceived personalization (PP) to the independent and dependent constructs of the model.

Because previous studies have found gender differences in the use of personalization, we suggest that the direct and indirect effects of personalization may be moderated by gender. Thus, these moderating effects of gender are also illustrated.

Figure 1 Research model  Note: EOU = perceived ease of use, USE = perceived usefulness, ATT = attitude, PP = perceived personalization, PBC = perceived behaviour control.

The model in figure 1 may be used as a basis for hypothesizing individual effects of personalization.

First, when personalizing enterprise portals, end-users create their own ?look and feel?. Thus, it may be easier for the end-users to find information that interests them. Enterprise portal interfaces may be adapted particularly to each end-user?s individual behaviour.

Lin and Wu [17] found that personalization had a positive effect on perceived ease of use, and we argue that this finding may also be generalized to workplace information systems. Thus, we propose that:  H1a: Personalization will influence perceived ease of use of enterprise portals positively   Scheepers [6] suggested that personalization increased the relevance of content, and with increased content relevance, the system was perceived as more useful. Lin and Wu [17] also found that personalization influenced perceived usefulness, and, in line with the arguments of generalization used above, we propose that:  H1b: Personalization will influence perceived usefulness of enterprise portals positively   The effects of personalization on attitudes have been investigated along two lines of reasoning. One has argued that high levels of personalization may affect attitudes negatively due to privacy concerns. The relationship between personalization and privacy has, however, been found to be highly sensitive to context [1], making us suggest that in organizational contexts, with high levels of trust, privacy concerns over  personalization are not the greatest. Along the other line of reasoning, it has been argued that personalization affects attitudes positively in the same ways as it affects usefulness and ease of use, and empirical support has been found for this [18]. Thus, we propose that:  H1c: Personalization will influence attitude towards using enterprise portals positively   Technology acceptance studies have found that  PBC has a significant effect on end-users? intentions to use information technology [19, 20]. Adding new functionality to information systems may influence the skills required to use the system. Greer and Murtaza [21] have shown that PBC-related factors, such as Internet experience, influence whether end-users adopt and use personalized websites. Even though personalization in a few cases requires more skills to effectively use the system, we suggest that personalization facilitates the use of the system, and thus, contributes to a higher level of PBC.

Furthermore, Tafarodi et al. [22] found that when individuals could choose how to solve a task, they often experienced a sense of personal control, even if the choice had no effect on their actual performance [22]. Therefore, we propose that:  H1d: Personalization will influence perceived behaviour control of enterprise portals positively   In technology acceptance studies applying TAM or TPB, explained variances in intentions to use the systems are often reported in the range from 30% to 50% [e.g. 20]. Thus, more than 50% of the variance in intentions is typically left unexplained applying these models. Examples of concepts that have been shown to have additional direct effects on intentions are trust [24], enjoyment and identity expressiveness [25], and prior experience [26]. Due to the multitude of personalization effects identified by Oulasvirta and Blom [10], including identity-related effects not included in the combined TAM/TPB-model, it is likely that personalization may also affect intentions to use enterprise portals directly. Thus, we propose that:  H1e: Personalization will influence behavioural intention to use enterprise portals positively   The second set of hypotheses that are investigated in this study considers gender differences in the effects of personalization. Studies have found that the acceptance models of information systems users differ by gender [27, 23]. Venkatesh and Morris [27] found that the influence of perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and subjective norm on behavioural  Intention  EOU  USE  PBC  Subjective norm  PP  Gender  ATT      intentions differed by gender. Cheung et al. [23] found that the influence of perceived ease of use on attitudes also differed by gender.

In addition, studies of personalization have shown that men and women personalize differently [11, 28].

Against this background, it is likely that personalization effects may also differ by gender.

As indicated above, Venkatesh and Morris [27] found that perceived ease of use was more important to female end-users than to male end-users. Thus, female end-users? intentions are more strongly influenced by ease of use. Because we propose that personalization affects perceived ease of use positively, we consequently, also propose that:  H2a: Personalization will influence perceived ease of use more strongly for women than it will for men   Ong and Lai [29] found that male end-users valued usefulness more strongly than female users. Thus, male end-users? intentions are more strongly influenced by usefulness. Because we propose that personalization affects perceived usefulness positively, it is also reasonable to propose that:  H2b: Personalization will influence perceived usefulness more strongly for men than it will for women   Many of the previous studies of gender differences  in technology acceptance have either not included attitudes [27] or not hypothesized gender differences on the effects of attitudes [23]. Concurrent with these studies, we do not propose any gender differences on the effects of personalization on attitudes. Previous studies have, however, found that female users personalize more than male users [11]. Because personalization has been shown to enhance the sense of personal control [22], we propose that:  H2c: Personalization will influence perceived behaviour control more strongly for women than it will for men   In addition to the finding that women personalized more than men, Wells [11] also found that personalization influenced women?s job satisfaction more positively. Because job satisfaction is among the set of variables possibly contributing to explained variance in intentions to use an enterprise system that is not covered by our applied TAM/TPB-framework, we assume that personalization may also affect intentions to use enterprise portals more strongly for those that personalize the most. Consequently, we propose that.

H2d: Personalization will influence behavioural intentions to use enterprise  portals more strongly for women than it will for men.

3. Method   To test our hypotheses, a survey was conducted among the 8000 users of an enterprise portal in a Norwegian government-owned enterprise. The enterprise was selected by two criteria: First, the enterprise had participated in an earlier qualitative study on enterprise portal personalization [30], and second, management had publicly expressed that personalization was a major priority in their enterprise portal development. The enterprise portal is based on Microsoft Sharepoint 2003 technology, and it is used as a desktop for the end-users and as an information channel. All end-users have individual ?My page? start-up pages. This page contains corporate news, department news, work task list, collaboration room list, favourites, project rooms and other less frequently used items. The survey focused on the ?My page?, and thus, the personalization of the ?My page? was used as the stimulus and context of the study.

3.1 Instrument   To measure perceived ease of use, perceived  usefulness, attitude, PBC, subjective norm and intentions to use the enterprise portal, we use standard items from the IS-literature that are well tested (see appendix A for wording of the items). For all the items except for the attitude construct, we used 5-point scales ranging from ?Strongly disagree? (1) to ?Strongly agree? (5). To measure attitudes we used three standard 5-point bipolar scales [25]. All the measures were designed as reflective. Variables were computed as the weighted average of construct items using the factor loadings of a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) of the measurement model as weights.

To study the effects of personalization, the construct may be manipulated by providing different informants with different personalization strategies and then analyse the effects of these manipulations.

Alternatively, perceived personalization may be measured using multiple measures and applied as an independent variable in the same way as the constructs of the combined TAM/TPB model. We decided to use the latter method to measure how the informants perceived the personalization of the enterprise portal.

The origin of this construct is found in a qualitative study of web-shop super-users [31]. Perceived personalization has been used in behavioural studies of mobile commerce [32], websites [31, 33], and adoption of recommendation agents [34].

Based on these studies, a measurement inventory of perceived personalization was developed and pre- tested among 147 informants in the same Norwegian government-owned enterprise as that of the main study. Based on the pre-study, a compact and parsimonious scale of perceived personalization was developed including the six items shown in appendix A. All items were systematically grouped using an online questionnaire application and made available to respondents online.

3.2 Procedure and sample   Participants were recruited using banner announcements on the ?My page? of the enterprise portal. A gift card drawing was used to stimulate recruitment. After one week, 450 respondents had participated, and at this point the banner was moved to the right side border of the enterprise portal.

After two weeks, the banner was removed from the enterprise portal, and survey recruitment was closed.

Now, 773 respondents had answered the whole or parts of or the complete questionnaire. When compared to the number of end-users accessing the enterprise portal during the period, this gives us a response rate of 10 %, which is comparable with similar, recently published, online survey studies [e.g. 35].

Of the 773 respondents, 15 were removed as extreme outliers, 20 were empty responses, 75 had only finished the first page of the questionnaire, 3 had unrealistic answers on quantitative control items (e.g.

the number of hours that ?My page? was used), whereas 13 were removed because they had used less than 5 minutes to complete the survey. Using less than 5 minutes was considered an indication of careless response. This gave a final sample of 647 responses to be used in further data analysis. Sample characteristics are shown in table 1.

Table 1 Sample characteristics  Gender % Male 44.6  Female 55.4 Age %  0 - 19 0.4 20 ? 29 9.3 30 ? 39 22.5 40 ? 49 39.5 50 ? 59 24.8  60 or more 3.6  When comparing sample characteristics with the  characteristics of the enterprise portal user population, the sample seemed representative, with an age  distribution concentrated between 30 and 59, and with a percentage of female respondents of 55.4.

4. Results   We used Amos 7.0 to test our measurement and structural models. We apply the recommended reporting structure of Henriksen and Pedersen [36], and report model fit for measurement model and structural model, as well as important measurement reliability and validity indicators.

To assess the reliability of the variables, we report construct reliability (CR) and Cronbach?s alpha. As seen from Table 2, all variables have Cronbach?s alpha above 0.7, and all measures except PBC, have CR above 0.7. CR for this variable is close to 0.7, and Hair et al. [37] state that CR between 0.6 and 0.7 is acceptable provided that other indicators are good.

Table 2 Reliability and convergent validity Item  CR Number  of items EOU 0.94 0.80 4 USE 0.94 0.80 4 ATT 0.89 0.72 3 PBC 0.86 0.69 3 SUB 0.88 0.70 3 PP 0.93 0.72 6 INT 0.89 0.74 3  Note: CR=construct reliability   To ensure construct validity, we also assess convergent and discriminant validity. Convergent validity is assessed investigating factor loadings of a CFA of the measurement model and the variances extracted. Variances extracted are reported along the diagonal of Table 3. Applying the criteria of Hair et al.

[37], we see that variances extracted are well above the recommended 0.5 for all measures.

In Appendix A, the factor loadings of the CFA are reported. All factor loadings are well above 0.7, and, consequently, we conclude that convergent validity is acceptable. To assess discriminant validity, we apply the principles of Hair et al. [37] comparing variances extracted with inter-construct squared correlations. In Table 3, correlations between model constructs are reported (below the diagonal) along with the squared correlations (above the diagonal). When comparing squared correlations with the variances extracted (along the diagonal), we find that all variances extracted are higher than the squared correlations, indicating acceptable discriminant validity.

Finally, measurement model fit was investigated.

The model showed a 2 of 776.3 with 278 degrees of freedom (p<0.01), a CFI of 0.96, a NFI of 0.94 and RMSEA was 0.053 (90% CI = 0.048, 0.057). From these indicators we conclude that measurement model fit is acceptable.

With acceptable measurement model fit and acceptable reliability and validity, we turn to structural equations modelling for testing the hypotheses of section 2. First, hypotheses 1a ? 1e are tested using a structural model estimated with the complete sample.

The structural model shows acceptable fit ( 2=1010.3, d.f.=286 (p<0.01), CFI = 0.95, NFI = 0.93, RMSEA=0.063 ((90% CI = 0.058, 0.067). The structural model results are illustrated in figure 2, where explained variances and standardized path coefficients of the complete model used to test hypotheses 1a-1e are shown in grey squares. The complete model accounts for 41% of the variance in PBC, 56% of the variance in usefulness, 51% of the variance in ease of use, 77% of the variance in attitude, and 39% of the variance in the intention to use the enterprise portal. From figure 2, we can se that the paths from ease of use to usefulness and attitude, and the path from usefulness to attitude are significant. The paths from PBC, usefulness and subjective norm to intention are all significant, showing their positive influences on the intention to use enterprise portals.

The pattern of significant paths and explained variances of the combined TAM/TPB-model do not deviate considerably from what one would expect to find in technology acceptance studies of information systems in organizational contexts.

Turning to the hypotheses that are the main scope of this study, we find that the paths from personalization to ease of use, usefulness, attitude and PBC are all positive and significant. This supports hypotheses H1a, H1b, H1c and H1d. Thus,  personalization has a significant positive effect on the antecedents of intention to use enterprise portals. The direct path from personalization to intention, however, is not significant. Thus we find no support for hypothesis H1e. This means that all the effects of personalization on intention to use enterprise portals in this study are mediated by ease of use, usefulness, attitudes towards use and PBC.

The hypotheses 2a-2d propose that the effects of enterprise portal personalization are moderated by gender. To test these hypotheses, we use the procedure for invariance testing originally presented by Bollen [38] and applied for multi-group analysis, in the same way as we apply it here, by Cheung et al. [23]. The procedure includes conducting tests of the differences in 2 when comparing the ?base model where all paths were freely estimated to the constrained model where one path coefficient was constrained to be equal across the two groups? [23, p. 478].

The model fits well for male users ( 2= 617.8, df = 286, CFI = 0.94, NFI = 0.89, RMSEA=0.070 ((90% CI = 0.063, 0.078)). The model accounts for 55% of the variance in usefulness, 36% of the variance in PBC, 44% of the variance in ease of use, 80% of the variance in attitude, and 44% of the variance in intention to use the enterprise portal. The paths between personalization and usefulness, PBC and ease of use are all significant. For female users, the model also fits well ( 2= 660.8, and df = 286, CFI = 0.94, NFI = 0.90, RMSEA=0.067 ((90% CI = 0.060, 0.074)). The model accounts for 57% of the variance in usefulness, 48% of the variance in PBC, 60% of the variance in ease of use, 74% of the variance in attitude, and 35% of the variance in intention to use the enterprise portal. Thus, we see that it is somewhat more difficult to explain the intentions of the female end-users than the male end-users. In this model the paths from personalization to ease of use, usefulness, attitude, and PBC are all significant.

Turning to the hypotheses 2a-2d, we conducted 2- difference tests using the procedure for multi-group analysis presented above. The results are presented in Table 4, showing which of the path coefficients that was held constant during estimation, the difference in 2 and the degrees of freedom of the test.

From Table 4 we see that only the paths between personalization and ease of use ( 2=7.56, p<0.01), and between personalization and PBC ( 2=5.58, p<0.05) are significantly different for male and female end- users. Thus, personalization affects ease of use and PBC differently for male and female end-users.

The path between personalization and ease of use (see figure 2) shows that personalization influences ease of use more for female ( =0.91, p<0.01) than for male ( =0.66, p<0.01) end-users. This finding supports hypothesis H2a that female users? perception of ease of use is more influenced by personalization. Personalization  also influences PBC more for female ( =0.71, p<0.01) than for male ( =0.49, p<0.01) end-users. Thus, hypotheses H2c is also supported. Since none of the other 2-difference tests are significant, hypotheses H2b and H2d are not supported. Even if we did not theoretically propose a specific gender difference in the effect of personalization on attitudes towards use, a 2- test of this difference could be interesting. It, however, also turned out not significant ( 2=0.73, d.f.=1).

Thus, we can conclude that for 4 hypotheses on gender differences in the effects of personalization, 2 are found significant. Both of these suggest stronger effects of personalization among female end-users than among male end-users. Consequently, we generally conclude that female end-users are more affected by personalization of enterprise portals than male end- users. A summary of the hypothesis testing results is shown in Appendix B.

5. Conclusions   Previous research on personalization suggests indirect, direct and moderated effects of enterprise portal personalization. Through a comprehensive study of enterprise portal personalization in a Norwegian government-owned enterprise, we found that ease of use, usefulness, attitudes towards use and behavioural control are influenced positively by personalization. In addition, we found some of these effects to be moderated by gender, suggesting that female users are more positively influenced by personalization than male users. This shows, as proposed by Scheepers [6], that personalization is an important feature for enterprise portals. In addition, our findings contribute to a better understanding of what personalization does to end-users? perceptions of enterprise portals and how it affects end-users? behaviour.

Our conclusions are naturally limited, mainly by external validity. Whereas we have shown the internal validity of the study to be good, the study may be criticized for lack of external validity due to particularities in the personalization operation, the enterprise portal operation and the specific sample characteristics of our study. Still, we argue that the personalization operation using a ?My page? is very typical to many enterprise portal applications. We also argue that the enterprise portal application used in this study is one of the most widespread globally. The level and variance in the perceived personalization measure also support our arguments that end-users perceived different levels of personalization for the studied enterprise portal. Furthermore, sample characteristics have been reported to enable validation of potential bias in sample demographics that may have affected      our findings in an invalidating way. It can also be argued that the relatively high average age of our respondents may influence our results, but we have conducted a multi-group analysis with age as a moderator, using the same procedure as for gender reported above. This analysis, applying a median split of the age variable, revealed no significant differences in any personalization effects between the age groups.

Thus, we argue that if done with care and consideration for differences in end-user characteristics, our conclusions may be generalized to other enterprise portal implementations.

The current study shows that the combined TAM/TPB-model may be used as a research framework for effectively studying the effects of IT- artefacts like personalization. This implies that further investigation of the effects of personalization may apply to and extend from the combined TAM/TPB- framework used here. It is also likely that more moderating effects may be identified in further studies of the effects of personalization, for example by experience, or by organizational roles.

Findings in this study also have implications for enterprise portal designers and for IS-managers implementing enterprise portals. Because personalization is shown to have positive effects on ease of use, usefulness, attitude towards use and behavioural control, financial and attentional investments in providing enterprise portals with rich personalization features are substantiated. Our results, showing that the effects of personalization features affects male and female end-users differently, also indicate that designers and IS-managers that implement enterprise portals should take into consideration which elements of the portal to personalize, and most importantly, for which user categories should personalization be most comprehensive. Further research on effect differences between user categories is required, but personalization of the kind investigated in this study is something that should be focused particularly in organizations with a majority of female employees to stimulate and promote enterprise portal use.
