Classification and Projection of Spatial Association  Rules

Abstract?This paper proposes an approach allowing the definition of association rules relative to a future date from sets of rules that are relative to previous dates. The produced rules concern the future land use in urban areas. The suggested approach allows the integration of variable data into existing techniques of spatial data mining. The used process is based on a meta-rules generation in order to classify produced rules according to their temporal evolution. Subsequently, the technique of least squares is used to estimate the future values of rule confidence according to which applicable rules to a future date will be selected. A prototype and an experiment on a spatial database taken at various dates gave encouraging results.

I.  INTRODUCTION Identifying the previous evolutions in geographical  phenomena has diverse objectives. It allows the detection and the measurement of temporal changes. It also makes it possible to qualify them and to determine trends of evolution over a given period of time. Thus, the understanding of the recent dynamics of space evolution is crucial to study its future evolution and its modeling.

The purpose of this work is the follow-up of the geographical phenomena dynamics, mainly the study of land use dynamics. The objective is to determine the spatial evolution trends which allow simulations and projections of the future evolution of this phenomenon.

In the present work, the knowledge about the space is produced by spatial association rules, and we aim to define a set of rules characterizing a future situation of a database from sets of rules extracted from the same database at different dates. Such an approach would make it possible to define forecasting rules.

To fulfill these objectives, an approach based on two main processes is proposed. The first one is the classification of rules extracted for the dates 1 to N. The second process concerns the projection of rules and the identification of the applicable ones to the date N+x.

This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 gives an overview of the most used methods to study land use evolution.

Section 3 presents our method. A prototype, an experiment and a discussion of the results are presented in section 4.



II. ADOPTED METHOD  A. The spatial association rules The association rules are a component of the research in  databases [1] which aim to find the correlations between variables. An association rule is a relation of the form "If A then B " where A and B are sets of predicates. It represents the causal relation between these predicates that can be interpreted as following: if we have all the predicates A then we tend to have all the predicates B. In other words, if the set A is present, the set B is "often" present. This relation is schematized by the expression:  A ? B (s%) (c%)  The set A is called premise and the set B is called conclusion.

An association rule is considered as spatial when one predicate from the premise A or one predicate from the conclusion B is spatial.

Certain work, such as [2], accentuates the exploitation of the spatial correlations between objects in order to produce more relevant Spatial Association Rules (SAR).

A rule is always produced with two measures that allow the appreciating of its "strength". These two measures or indicators are the support (s %) and the confidence (c %). The support is the percentage of transactions which verify A and B among all the transactions of the transactions base. It is the absolute probability P(AB) that the rule is verified in a transaction, that is the premise A and the conclusion B are both present. The confidence, on the other hand, is the percentage of transactions which verify the conclusion (and the premise) of a rule among those that verify the premise.

Those two measures help to appreciate the best rules to be chosen. They also help to reduce the number of extracted rules.

Indeed, the extraction of SAR collides with the very significant number of produced rules. For that reason, an important issue in data mining concerns the implementation of steps allowing reducing the number of produced rules [3].

Technologies of Information and Telecommunications (SETIT)     B. Spatial association rules for predicting and monitoring Several researches consider the spatial association rules for  reasons related to prediction and follow-up of the dynamics.

Umamaheshwaran .R et al. [4] tried to model and to analyze the relationships between the temperature of the surface of the earth and other environmental factors. The results were put in the form of spatial association rules for the year 2000, then to use these relations on different period of time (2001 and 2004) to detect the seasonal effects.

Puissant et al. [5] demonstrated that it was possible to build a base of association rules of the geographical objects in urban zones from an algorithm of symbolic overseen apprenticeship.

This base of rules served to identify and to classify the urban and peri-urban objects in a satellite image. Manfred et al. [6] made classifications of the ecosystem and the land use based on association rules. The obtained rules produced useful knowledge for the regional planning.

The spatial association rules were applied for prediction purposes [7] mainly in order to detect the change of the evolutionary phenomena but not for follow-up and prediction.

They were also used in several domains such as geomarketing, determination of origins of dispersal of some diseases, etc.

The present research is a part from the issue concerning the prediction and the follow-up of the dynamics of spatial phenomena. The proposed approach is presented in the next sections.

C.  System architecture The proposed approach is composed of two main parts. The  first part allows the classification of spatial association rules produced over time. For this purpose, a process of generating meta-rules is used. The second part includes an approach for estimating future values of rule interestingness measures based on the technique of least squares. Figure.1 shows the architecture proposed in this framework.

Figure 1.  General system architecture  Our approach (cf. Figure. 1) can handle and exploit multiple data sources, for example existing geographical databases to extract spatial association rules that will be useful  later in the reproduction phase. Moreover, to ensure the grained space-time, data must be related to a zone of study at different time intervals. These data bases will be used to extract the SAR on different dates. The rule extracting algorithm is the one proposed by Koperski (not mentioned explicitly in this paper because the main approach here concerns the classification and projection rules and not their extraction). Then we apply the method of meta-rules [8] on the obtained set of rules, as well as the methods of least squares.

D. Meta-rules method for rule classification The ability to extract new types of rules based on the  availability of temporal information was introduced by [8] to capture the changes and movements of objects in space. To do this, two new types of rules have been proposed.

The first type concerns the meta-rules which are derived from the comparison of sets of rules generated at different times on the same field. Therefore, meta-rules describe the changes in the set of rules obtained from the recordings and snapshots of consecutive data in the information system.

The second type is the evolution rules which are derived from descriptions of changes and developments representing the movement of spatial objects and phenomena are directly examined. Indeed, the information described by this latter approach is not generally available explicitly in the spatio- temporal information systems.

In addition to that, the derivation of these rules is a complex problem. For these reasons, our choice was directed towards the application of the meta-rules method [8] on the sets of extracted rules. The rules obtained have the form X ? Y and C% as confidence. A threshold Sd was defined to differentiate stable rules (difference of inferior confidences to Sd) and variable rules (difference of superior confidences to Sd).

For a set data compound of rules extracted in n date, the rules are classified as follows:  ? New rules that did not appear in the earlier set of rules:  (1)  ? The stable rules appear in the set of rule with a confidence value stable over time:  (2)  ? Variables Rules appears in different times but with substantially different values of confidence:  (3)  ? And finally, the expired rules representing the set of rules that disappear over time:  (4)

III. ASSOCIATION RULES PROJECTION The purpose of this phase is to find a way to identify a set  of association rules that would be relevant to a future date.

Therefore, four groups of rules from the previous classification i.e. classification with the meta-rules method, will undergo different treatments. Stable and new rules are included in the final set of rules to be applicable at a later date.

However the expired rules are removed.

We selected the confidence of variable rules to be the projected measure in time. For these rules, the values of the confidence change substantially over time. We propose to take in consideration the different fluctuations undergone by these values in the past to project the new value in the future. The choice of confidence is explained by the fact that this measure is insensitive to the size of the data and its meaning may be subject to such treatment. The support was not included because this measure is not sufficient to evaluate a rule. It is often used to eliminate non-interesting association rules. But it does not correspond to a real explanation of the relationship between A and B.

For the reason that the trends of urban developments are not cyclic, the analytical adjustment /curve-fitting (least squares method) between the different values of confidence taken by the rule, is used to set up their projection in the time. The goal is to find the best straight line of adjustment. This line of confidence has the below equation:  Y = at + b                                     (5)    where t represent the time factor used. The determination of the parameters of this equation is calculated by the method of least squares where:     (6)       (7)      Where y is the value of confidence on the rule and n is the number of years of different observations.

By the technique of least squares, we can estimate future values of confidence. If the projected value of the confidence is above a prefixed threshold, the rule will be considered relevant to the current date. Otherwise, it will be rejected.



IV. PROTOTYPE AND EXPERIMENTATION  A. Dataset The experimentation of the approach was performed on a  real data set covering a part of the North Coast of Tunis. A geographical database was used consisting of 551 records matching urban blocks covering the study area.

Figure 2.  localisation of dataset in Tunisia  Four versions of the same spatial database corresponding to the years 1975, 1988, 1998 and 2002 were used. Their implementation has been done through the photo-interpretation of cartographic sources for those dates. Thus, the versions for the years 1975, 1988 and 1998 were used to extract rules by the technique of spatial data mining. Afterward, we have classified and projected the rules relatively to the year 2002, which corresponds to the estimation step.

Other rules will be extracted by spatial data mining technique from the version of the spatial database relative to 2002. The validations step consists on the comparison of both sets of rules in order to evaluate the results of the application of the proposed approach.

B. The developed prototype In order to implement our suggestion, we developed a  prototype with Java language. We used as development tool Jbuilder9. This prototype allows the automation of all the activities that constitute our particular approach and notably the classification operations and projection rules in accordance with our suggestion.

User interfaces are designed to facilitate all setting. Thus, by fixing the year of prediction and the minimum threshold of confidence, the user can systematically obtain a set of spatial association rules that are relevant to the prefixed date. Figure 3 presents a set of rules produced by the prototype.

Figure 3.  Example of prototyp result  C. Results and Discussion We applied our approach on the content of geographic  databases described in Section 4.1. The first phase consisted in extracting rules from different databases, to classify them and to achieve afterward the projection on the selected date (2002).

Table 1 shows the number of rules generated from data mining (dates 1975, 1988, 1997 and 2002) using the tool EARAS (Extraction and Application of Spatial Association Rules) that we developed at a previous work [9] and the number of the projected rules obtained by the application of our approach and the developed prototype (date 2002). The tolerance level was set at 10% and the minimum confidence to 50%, which explains the reduced number of rules.

TABLE I.  NUMBER OF EXTRACTED RULES  Year  1975 1988 1988 2002  Real  Predicted Number ofrules 21 16 18 33 35    Table 2 shows the distribution rules based on categories from the classification in meta-rules. Three quarters of the rules are variable rules.

TABLE II.  DISTRIBUTION OF OBTAINED RULES (2002)  Type of rules  New rules  Stable rules  Variable rules  % 8.8 17.6 73.5    We have performed the classification rules that allowed keeping stable rules, expired rules, new rules and variable rules for the years 1975, 1988, 1997. The stable and new rules are conserved and the variable rules were projected through our tool for 2002. A comparison between the rules relating to 2002 obtained by the use of our prototype projection rules and those obtained directly by extracting knowledge from the geographic database on the same year showed small differences (cf Fig. 4 and Table 3).

Figure 4.  Preview result of use of the prototype showing comparison between real and estimated confidence  The examination of the obtained results showed that 70.8% of generated rules presents a confidence of which the gaps with real confidences are less than 5% (cf. table 3).

V. CONCLUSION We proposed an approach allowing the use of spatial  association rules produced at various dates to perform a set of rules concerning future date. We used for this aim an approach of rule classification which considers their dynamics.

We also used the least square technique for the projection of interestingness measures of rules. We set up a prototype and applied our approach to a set of spatial association rules. The obtained results were quite satisfactory. Such results can be used in a future follow-up of the spatial phenomena.

It would be also interesting to compare the results of this approach with those of other ones based on spatio-temporal association rules.
