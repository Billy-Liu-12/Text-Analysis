I. INTRODUCTION Internet has become a mainstream media for information  communication, exchange and sharing. The rapid increase of the number of global websites as well as information volume and complexity of each website has also brought certain difficulties for user access, for it is quite common for a website to contain thousands of web pages and hyperlinks.

Therefore, we have to utilize web log mining tools such as association rules, sequential patterns and page clustering to obtain user access information at a deeper level. To optimize website design based on current access information of website and build more reasonable, easy-to-use, individualized and relevant websites has become one of the hot spots of research.

Among website optimization algorithms, relevant page clustering is one of the most important contents. For example, Su et al. propose a recursive density based clustering algorithm (RDBC)[1,2], which is an improved algorithm based on DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Application with Noise) , it allows intelligent and dynamic modification of its density parameters. Using RDBC in web article clustering not only retains the high speed of DBSCAN, but also obtains better clustering effect than DBSCAN. Song et al. present an efficient and multi- purpose Web log mining algorithm [3], which establishes an incidence matrix with website URLs as row and UserID as column. The algorithm in [3] analyzes column vector to obtain customer group and measures row vector similarity to  obtain relevant web pages. Mobasher et al. apply the association rules based frequent itemset to identify frequently accessed paths makes URL clustering through a so-called clustering method of ?association rule hypergraph partition? and makes online recommendation through a recommendation engine [4]. Yang et al. propose a page clustering improvement algorithm combining website topological structure and web page contents to improve the interest of mining results [5].

The association matrix clustering algorithm proposed in [3] is an efficient mining algorithm, but the elements in the matrix correspond to the number of clicks of a website, which can not completely reflect customer?s interest in the clicked web page, so the accuracy issue exists. The website structure optimization technology is based on customer website access interest matrix to mine similar customer groups and relevant web pages to discover the hidden customer access patterns and realize a reasonable and effective optimized website structure, and thus provides a convenient and quick information acquisition environment.



II. RELEVANT DEINITIONS When we establish a page, we categorize the page  according to contents, and apply a system page label set which is denoted as:  },,,{ 21 nlabellabellabelLabel Interest in each page label is defined as follows: Definition 1: The main interest of customers in  ][iLabel  category is the number of visits to contents under the ][iLabel  category. The corresponding formula of main interest ][iL  is:  ][][][ iCilabeliL ?=                        (1) Where ][iC is the number of customer clicks of the category of ][ilabel .

Definition 2: The additional interest of customers in ][iLable  category is the product of relevancy of  customers? main interest in other categories multiplying an attenuation factor. The formula is as follows:  2008 International Symposium on Computer Science and Computational Technology  DOI 10.1109/ISCSCT.2008.124     ],[][][ ijsjLciJ ??=                      (2) Where, c is the attenuation factor.

The relevancy of labels ],[ ijs  and the attenuation factor c are defined according to our experience and knowledge.

According to Definition 1, we know that the more number of times customers visit ][iLabel  category, the higher the interest of the customers in the category; according to Definition 2, the higher the interest of the customers in the ][iLabel  category, the higher possibility that the customers will be interested in categories having larger relevancy to ][iLabel , that is, the higher ][ jJ  here.

According to customers? history access patterns, the interest set of the customers in ][iLabel  is as follows:  ][][][ iJiIiZ +=                         (3) The element jia ,  in the customer interest matrix in our  later research is generated based on ][iZ .



III. WEBSITE STRUCTURE OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM  A.  Customer access behavior description Web server log includes access log, reference log and  proxy log. After combining and eliminating these logs, we represent our server log in the form of  timeurluidipL ,,,= , where uid , ip , url and time indicate customer ID, customer IP address, customer request URL and corresponding browse time. Then further processing is performed on the log to reflect customer?s browse behavior in a certain period of time.

B.  Customer interest matrix representation The basis of our proposed website structure optimization  technology is the customer interest matrix )( nmS ? , where m is the number of pages, and n is the number of customers.

The row containing S represents all pages accessed in the log, and the column containing S represents every customer of the log, and each element ija  in the matrix is the interest of customer ja in visiting page ][ilabel .

=?nmS  ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  nmjmmm  nijiii  nj  nj  aaaa  aaaa  aaaa aaaa  ,,2,    1,  ,, 2,1,  ,2,22,21,2  ,1,12,11,1            (4)  We can know from the matrix that each row of vectors represents access of all customers on a specific RUL, each column of vectors represents the access of all URLs of the website by a specific customer. Therefore, the row vectors imply customers? common access patterns, while the column vectors imply access interest of a customer. On this basis, we can analyze the row vectors to obtain similar  customer groups and analyze the column vectors to obtain relevant pages.

Refer to [3] for the similarity measurement method, the customer group clustering algorithm and web-page clustering algorithm hereunder.

C.  Similarity measurement method Similarity measurement is conducted according to  Hamming distance. For 0],[ >? jiS , 1],[ =jiS . Then calculate the Hamming distance between vectors. The smaller the Hamming distance, the higher the similarity.

Definition 3 Hamming distance: suppose { }nYX 1,0, ? , 1?n , then the Hamming distance ),( YXH d between X  and Y is defined as:  ? =  ?= ||||   ||),( X  i iid YXYXH                    (5)  D.  Customer group clustering algorithm During clustering, we first remove the column vectors of  zero value from the association matrix nmS ? . For 0],[ >? jiS , set 1],[ =jiS . Then establish the distance  matrix dH nnD ?  between column vectors according to their  Hamming distance. In the symmetric matrix dH nnD ? , any ),1(, njiniDd d  H nnji ?<??? ?  represents the Hamming  distance between the i-th column vector and the j-th row vector, and the value of diagonal element is 0. Finally, we can specify the threshold ?  according to situation.

For ),1(, njiniDd d H  nnji ?<???? ? , if ?<jid , , then the i- th customer and all the j-th customers meeting this condition will be put into one category.

E.  Web-page clustering algorithm During clustering, firstly we remove the column vectors  of zero value from the association matrix nmS ? as mentioned above. For 0],[ >? jiS , set 1],[ =jiS . Then calculate the Hamming distance between row vectors and establish the distance matrix dH nnD ?  between column vectors according to their Hamming distance. In the symmetric matrix dH nnD ? , any  ),1(, njiniDd d H  nnji ?<???? ?  represents the Hamming distance between the i-th column vector and the j-th row vector, and the value of diagonal element is 0. Finally, we can specify the threshold ?  according to situation.

For ),1(, njiniDd d H  nnji ?<???? ? , if ?<ijd , then the i- th URL and all the j-th URLs meeting this condition will be put into one category.



IV. EXPERIMENT RESULTS In this section, we have tested the performance and effect  of the algorithm based on real dataset. This algorithm is realized through C++ and complied in VS .net 2003     environment. All tests are operated on a single PC with Windows XP, Celeron(R) 2.02G CPU and 512M memory.

We mainly tested the accuracy of the algorithm. In the test, we used Gazelle_Data data file, which provides 70,163 URLs and 10,029 customers in total. In order to facilitate calculation, we selected 10 test instances, each of which has the number of URLs between 20 and 40 and the number of customers between 60 and 140. Make manual analysis first to obtain similar customer groups and relevant web-pages.

Then process according to the algorithm mentioned in this paper and customer click rate matrix algorithm mentioned in [3] to obtain corresponding data. Next, compare accuracy of manual results and the results of the two algorithms to obtain accuracy comparison curves in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. In the test, the page relevancy ],[ ijS  and the attenuation factor c can be obtained based on experience. The results in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 show that when good page relevancy and attenuation factor are selected, the accuracy of customer interest matrix and page clustering accuracy are higher than that of the algorithm mentioned in [3]. This indicates that our algorithm has higher accuracy.
