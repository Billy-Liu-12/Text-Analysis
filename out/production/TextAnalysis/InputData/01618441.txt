Classification Rules for Pre-Analysis Filtering of Web Transactions

Abstract   Web usage mining is the process of applying data mining techniques to discover usage patterns from web data to serve the needs of web based organizations. These patterns are usually expressed in the form of association rules. In this paper, we attempt to improve the performance of algorithms for mining web association patterns in terms of runtime and quality of results. We made use of the fact that only a small portion of user sessions lead to the generation of interesting rules.

Decision trees were used to extract classification rules describing interesting sessions. These rules were applied on future data to focus the analysis on interesting sessions. The average classification accuracy was 94.29% and the average sensitivity was 28.16%. The use of classification rules caused an average improvement in runtime of 63.13%. The improvement in the precision of the system was not significant. The average improvement in precision was 5.34%. The average recall of the system was 95.06%.

1. Introduction   Web based organizations generate huge volumes of data during their operations. This information is collected automatically by web servers and stored in server logs.

The analysis of server logs provides information on how to structure websites, what ads to target to which group of users, and how to develop marketing policies.

Web server logs are the main source of data for mining users? usage patterns. Web servers usually collect the following information about a single page reference: the user accessing the page, access time, request method (?GET? or ?POST?), the URL of the required page, transmission protocol, return code and the number of bytes transmitted. Web usage mining focuses on the user,  access time and URL fields. An example of web server logs is shown in table 1.
