I. INTRODUCTION Spatial Data Mining (SDM), an important branch of Data  Mining, refers to extraction of implicit knowledge, spatial relationships, and other patterns which are not explicitly stored in Spatial Database. Geographic Information System (GIS) is a system based on Geospatial Database for geographic decision support. Introducing the concept, pattern and method of DM and KDD into the field of GIS, we can use the storage management and analysis function of GIS to make the limited data in GIS become the limitless knowledge. For doing so, we can effectively handle the huge data, advance the autoimmunization and intelligence level of the geography data analysis and offer powerful analysis tools for the globe change and sustainable development.



II. SPATIAL DATA MINING  A. The definition of spatial data mining Spatial data mining is based on spatial database, and on the  comprehensive utilization of statistical method, pattern recognition technology, artificial intelligence method, neural network technology, rough set, fuzzy mathematics, machine learning, expert system and related information technology, etc.

It disjunctives credible, novel, interested, hidden, prior unknown, potential useful and ultimately comprehensible knowledge from a lot of spatial data such as production data, manage data, business data or remote sensing data.

B. The application of spatial data mining in GIS Finding knowledge from GIS spatial database, using this  knowledge in GIS again, and improving the level of the intelligent of GIS will facilitate the development of GIS. The knowledge found from GIS has two main aspects of application:  1) GIS intelligent analysis  Applying spatial data mining to GIS can find knowledge the users need from GIS spatial database automatic or semi-  automatic, directly provide use to decision makers or guide further treatment, make it a GIS intelligent analytical tool and an important tool which constitutes GIS expert system and decision support system.

2) The application in remote sensing imagery interpretation  Finding knowledge from GIS database through the spatial data mining technology can be used for solving prachanda foreign and doppler synonyms problems by restriction, auxiliary, guiding in remote sensing imagery interpretation, reduce the doubt degrees in classification of recognition, improve the reliability, precision and speed of interpretation.

The spatial data mining is an important technology and a tool to establish a knowledge acquisition of remote sensing imagery interpretation understanding expert system, and the structure of remote sensing imagery interpretation can renew GIS database.

Therefore, the spatial data mining technology will promote intelligent integration of remote sensing and GIS.



III. THE SPATIAL DATA MINING MODEL BASED ON GIS Through the research on spatial data mining technology,  using GIS spatial data management and spatial analysis function, this paper puts forward a spatial data mining model based on GIS, as is shown in figure 1.

Figure 1. a spatial data mining model based on GIS  In this model, the data preprocessing involves the incomplete, inaccurate, repeat, inconsistent spatial data processing stored in GIS database. Because of the handling work is an application subject of concrete analysis, data modeling is difficult, the processing method is related to the  ___________________________________     spatial data sample, it is hard to summarize general steps and methods, the experimental results of the same methods in different application environment often differ greatly.

Therefore, aiming at  different spatial data mining algorithm, setting up different mathematical model, making each kind of spatial data mining methods has corresponding data processing model is an effective way to reduce manual intervention degree of data processing and enhance model generality. Putting forward this model is mainly to provide a generic framework for finding knowledge from GIS. It is only made a generally elaboration for the work style of various unit in the model, and the specific details of the work need further research.



IV. SPATIAL ASSOCIATION RULES MINING METHOD BASED ON GIS  Finding spatial association rules from spatial database is the key of research on the spatial data mining technology.

According to the spatial data mining model based on GIS and combining with association rules mining algorithm, it is proposed a spatial association rules mining method based on concept lattice, its principle is to introduce concept lattice in spatial data mining technology, to combine GIS spatial analysis and data storage function with the association rules mining algorithm of concept lattice effectively, to find association relationship between the special entities in multiple layers from GIS database.

The key to this method is to transform the spatial relations between spatial objects into form background, to tectonic spatial object connect watch, and then to extract association rules using concept lattice methods. It is mainly involved two parts of the job: the work of GIS and the work of concept lattice.

1) The work of GIS: the main work of GIS is to use its powerful spatial analysis functions, to find out the spatial relationships between the multiple layers of spatial entities, such as intersection, approach, contains etc. Using the found spatial relation, obtaining the predicate said between spatial entities, finally realizing performance between multiple layers of spatial entities in the same rules.

2) The work of concept lattice: concept lattice is a kind of effective method of extracting association rules, but the existing spatial association rules mining method generally uses the classical Apriori algorithm to extract association rules. The efficiency of concept lattice is higher compared to Apriori, therefore the work of concept lattice is to extract association rules, to reduce the time complexity of spatial mining algorithm.

The specific process of this method is divided into four steps, respectively for preparation of spatial data background, creating connections tables, concept lattice construction and spatial association rules mining. Through the above four steps we can realize spatial association rules mining from the GIS, combining spatial data mining algorithm model based on GIS , and give the algorithm flow chart as follows:  Figure 2. spatial association rules mining process

V. SPATIAL ASSOCIATION RULES MINING EXPERIMENT On the basis of spatial association rules mining method,  according to the spatial association rules mining steps, using the spatial analysis and data management functions of MAPGIS, makes experimental validation to spatial association rules mining method. The data used in the experiment comes from a provincial agricultural transaction database; this database contains agricultural trading market, types of agricultural products, volume, origin, price and other related agricultural products data. In addition, we still use the data from the provincial geographic information system for transportation, including transportation roads related data of province highway, railway, and river.

1) Through the MAPGIS spatial query functions, retrieving and extracting relevant data collections from agricultural transaction database and geographic information system for transportation as follows: (1) Trading market, including attribute data {market name, agricultural products name, transaction price etc}. (2) Road, including attributes {road name, length, starting and terminal point etc}, there is a conceptual hierarchical relationship in road; its concept hierarchy (figure 3). (3) River, including attribute data {river name, length, etc}. Meanwhile, it gives spatial relation concept hierarchy (figure 4) and defines a spatial predicate table (experts or specific users given, such as table 1), along with road concept hierarchical relationships to build expert knowledge.

Figure 3. road concept hierarchy charts    TABLE I. SPATIAL PREDICATE  1 Adjacent_to  2 Interesects  3 Close_to <=10km  4 Far_from >=10km  2) The aim of the experiment is to find trading market price level and the relationship between road and river, therefore trading market layer is determined as the reference layer, national highway, railway, river respectively as related layer.

Using MAPGIS spatial analysis function (buffer zone analysis, superimposing operations), to calculate the relations between trading market and national highway, railway and river spatial, and to obtain the corresponding spatial relation predicate, to import spatial relation predicate into database tables, to constitute the relationship table between spatial entities (TABLE II).

First, extracting market name of the trading market and the price fields from relation database, statistic price data histogram, using histogram equalization method to make price data discretized, using "high", "medium" and "low" three qualitative value to describe agricultural product price attribute, import the generalized attribute price data into the relation database. Then, supposed  that this experiment demands to find the association rules between the second concepts of the road, making the corresponding data generalized according to road concept hierarchical relationship, getting the generalized spatial entities relation table. Finally, fusing the generalized price data and the spatial entities relation table, constitute a spatial predicate connection table (TABLE III).

Set M represents the trading market; P represents price, A represents national highway, B represents railway, C represents river.

A1 represents intersects national highway, A2 represents close to national highway, A3 represents far from national highway.

B1 represents intersects railway, B2 represents close to railway, B3 represents far from railway.

C1 represents intersects river, C2 represents adjacent to river, C3 represents far from river.

P1 represents the price is high, P2 represents the price is centered, P3 represents the price is low  TABLE IV.

The experiment uses 1 ~ 6 lines in the form background table, the generated concept lattice result as shown in figure 5:  Figure 5. the generated concept lattice result  According to the generated concept lattice, we can draw the corresponding Hasse diagram. In the analysis, the attention is on the number of the extension which includes various  connotation sets, therefore, extension is represented by the extension number which has the same meaning sets, Hasse diagram is shown in figure 6.

Figure 6. Hasse diagram  5) According to the generated concept lattice, with connotation cut set generating association rules algorithm, extracting association rules. Set the minimum support degree as 0.3, confidence as 0.7, inputting all the data from form background table (table 4), we can get all meet minimum support degrees and minimum confidence association rules about trading market, market price, national highway, railway and river, such as:  is_a (X, trading market) middle (price) intersects (X, railway) (31.5%, 75%)  intersects (X, railway) intersects (X, national highway) is_a (X, trading market) High(price) (67%, 85%)  CONCLUSION Finding knowledge from GIS is an important branch of GIS  research, this paper is based on further research and discussion of the spatial data mining technology and geographic information system, combining with the function of geographic information system and the features of the spatial data mining, through certain conversion, applying non-business data mining method to the spatial data mining, designing and realizing feasible technique in doing spatial data mining from GIS.

Combining the spatial data mining with geographic information system, not only can make the spatial data mining more convenient and visual, but also can make the analysis function of the geographic information system more powerful, and become intelligent geographic information system.
