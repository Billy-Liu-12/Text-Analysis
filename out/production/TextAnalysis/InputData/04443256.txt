I. INTRODUCTION EB based education has become the new growth point of education development and primary developing trend of modern education technology. There are many  problems in current web based education, such as singularity teaching mode, educational resource stacking simply, low intelligence level etc [1]. But different student has different learning capability, personal interest, personal learning foundation and struggling level. Giving corresponding learning content and tactics to realize teaching learners according to their needs is very difficult. Its basic reason lies in being difficult by obtaining the relations between the learner's personality characteristics and learning behavior patterns accurately and automatically. Data mining provides a strong support for personalized network education [2].In this way, it is necessary to mine out the association rules between personality characteristics and learning behavior patterns.

The subsequent learners? personality and characteristics are deduced from their learning behaviors by using the rules above. Based on it, personality-learning model is set up and interesting groups are formed. Thus, personalized learning and cooperative learning are realized.

At present, many scholars have carried on a great deal of researches on association algorithms, such as such as Apriori algorithm or improved Apriori algorithm FP-tree [3]. The execution time of their algorithms was long while searching for the frequent item-set and the rule?s interest degree was low. Even a large number of redundant rules are also included [4]. Besides, the complexity of space and time is high.

According to this, an improved association rule mining algorithm is proposed in the paper. It has improved the traditional algorithm, and introduced data cube, relative method in statistics and adaptive adjusting mechanism in intelligence control [5]. The algorithm had two advantages.

The first was that the execution time was short while  searching for the frequent item-set; the second was that the precision of the rules was high. The algorithm was also used in personality mining system based on Web based education model. The result manifested that the algorithm was effective.



II. AN IMPROVED ASSOCIATION RULES The steps of an association rules mining based on data  cube as follows: Step1: establishing data cube from database Step2: mining frequent item-set which satisfies the  minimum support on data cube Step3: generating association rules of frequent item-set.

Step4: redundant association rules are wiped off through  the relative method  A. Establishing Data Cube Supposed in personality model database, we observe the  data by three dimensional angles. These three dimensions separately are learning behavior patterns dimension, learner's personality characteristics dimension, and time dimension.

Then data cube is obtained through OLAP operation from data base [6]. Fig.1 is data cube by 3-D.

Fig. 1  Data cube by 3-D  Each dimension relates to one table that is called dimension table. It carries on further description to the dimension. For example, personality characteristics dimension contains name, sex, age, income, occupation, hobby, character and so on.

Above the specific angle (dimension) also has many different descriptions in detail degree. This kind of description is called dimension level. One dimension generally has the many levels. For example, the description of time dimension may describe different level from year, quarter, month, date and so on. Year, quarter, month, and date are the dimension level of time.

The  algorithm searching for the frequent item-set on data cube is called Personal_ Cube_Apriori algorithm. kL  Represents set of frequent k_ item-set, Ck Represents set of candidate k_ item-set. The idea of adaptive adjusting of the Personal_ Cube_Apriori algorithm as follow:  Firstly, the algorithm searches for frequent k_ item-set for each dimension. If some dimensions don?t have frequent k_ item-set, it shows that the dimension level is excessively low and we should drill through above and improve the dimension level. If in some dimensions, all frequent k_ item-set is frequent k_ item-set, it shows that the dimension level is excessively high and we should drill through under and lower dimension level.

Fig .2 is shown as the flow of Personal_ Cube_Apriori    Fig.2. The flow of personal cube aprior.

Fig .2 is shown as the flow of Personal_ Cube_Apriori  Input: n dimension data cube 1 2( , , )nd d d count ,  minimum support min_sup, k=1  Output: set of frequent item-set kL L L= ? _ ( )k kL gen frequent C=  Represents set of candidate k_  item -set generating frequent k_ item-set 1_ ( )K kC gen candidate L ?=  Represents set of frequent  (k-1) _ item-set joining, pruning and generating k_ item-set   C. Generating Irredundant Association Rules After mining out frequent item-set, the process of  generating association rules is composed of two steps: Step1: regarding to each frequent item-set l, all non-  spatial subsets are generated.

Step2: regarding to each non- spatial subset of frequent  item-set l, if Then the rule s=> (l-s) is generated. min_conf represent  the minimum confidence thresholds, support count(l) represents the number of transaction containing item-set l, support count(s) represents the number of transaction containing item-set s.

Lower interest degree rules are obtained in this way, so the redundant rules must be wiped off. Thus, the paper introduces  sup _ ( ) min_ sup _ ( )  port count l conf port count s  ?           (1)  the relative analysis method in statistics to wipe off the redundant rules. After mining out one association rule, we calculate the correlation among frequent item-set. Concept of correlation is formula 2  ( ) ( )r  O rCORR E r  =                                      (2)  rCORR More approaches to 1, the independence among set of r item-set is better. For example, the association rule ? =>?, X, Y are the item-set. If its correlation is worse, it must be the false strong rule.

Relative analysis method is applied in k dimension data cube. If item or dimension Y is 1 2, , , rY Y Y ?values, X is  1 2, , sX X X  s values, ijn  represents the number of X is iY , and X is jX .

1, 2, ,  s  i ij j  n n i r =  = =?                           (3)  1,2, ,  r  j ij i  n n j s =  = =?                         (4)  1 1  r s i j  ij ij i j  n n n n m  n= = = =??                         (5)   1 1  ( )r s ij ij i j ij  n m n  m ?  = =  ? = ??                        (6)  2? Is correlation degree among items, if all items are independent, 2? is 0. Supposed the critical value is assigned.

If 2? is bigger than the critical value, X and Y are statistical correlation. Otherwise, they are not statistical correlation.

Namely, they are independent.



III. PMSEM The technologies of personality, data mining are applied  in the paper [7], while the model of personality mining system based on web based education is shown in Fig.3         Fig.3. The model of Personality mining system based on Web based education  The main function of Personality mining system based on Web based education is to find out the association rules between personality characteristics and learning behavior patterns. The subsequent learners? personality characteristics can deduce from their learning behavior by using the rules above.

The personality model is composed of personality characteristics and learning behavior patterns. Personality characteristics including name, sex, age, income, occupation, hobby, character and so on. Learning behavior patterns including learning courseware, issue information on BBS and so on. A web  sever log records user's IP address, visiting time, visiting page, visiting way, requested the document URL ,HTTP version, return codes, transmission bytes, protocol, wrong codes and so on.

The work process of model is as follows: firstly, learner personality information is collected though personality investigation and register information. Then, personality characteristics are obtained though personality merging.

Redundant personality characteristics are wiped off though personality merging. Furthermore, learning behavior patterns are obtained by analyzing learning logs. Finally, behavior- personality rules are mining out by analyzing the association rules between personality characteristics and learning behavior patterns. Thus, the subsequent learners? personality characteristics are deduced from their learning behavior according to the rules.
