Specifically, the  hypothesis formation and compatibility logic are designed to  address the issues associated with radar multipath returns  from multiple targets within a building. In addition to the  direct returns from the targets, there are typically several  returns on each dwell produced by reflections of the radar  beam off the building walls before and/or after the beam  intersects the target. Multiple passes through the MHT  hypothesis formation logic are performed in order to allow  tracks to be updated with both direct and multipath  observations on the same dwell. The first pass assumes  observations to be direct path and later passes assume feasible  multipath models. Final track pruning based upon probability  is deferred until all passes for a given dwell are completed.

Thus, a track can be updated by more than one observation on  a single dwell, but an observation can only be used once in any  valid hypothesis. This paper describes the multipath modeling  approach and the filtering and data association logic that has  been implemented. Representative results obtained using real  data from a through the wall radar that detected moving  targets in a building are shown to validate the method.
