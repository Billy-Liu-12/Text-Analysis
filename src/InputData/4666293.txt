A Novel Approach to Find the Revising and Launching Automobile Type

Abstract  Nowadays, many decision models are the revision of data-driven. These models are defined as follows: given an existing model and a set of data items,revise the model to match the data items. In this paper, a novel study on the revising and launching automobile type is based on de- cision support and business intelligence system. Fuzzy set theory and expert knowledge are also employed and a new association rule algorithm is yielded during the research.

The model is tested under experiment environment and gets satisfaction results. So the model is provable and valuable.

1 Introduction  Decision models are an essential part of decision analy- sis. Usually a lot of efforts are dedicated to the construction of a suitable and useful model. Expert knowledge and data that describes the decision problem or known solutions are carefully combined into a model.

The use of the model depends on the characteristics of decision problem. Some models are used only once, when a difficult decision has to be thoroughly studied[1]. On the other hand, there are models built for continuous use on a regular, e.g. daily, basis [2]. Most of the models that are used continuously have to be regularly revised to reflect the new state of decision problem as well as possible. Building a model is a demanding, time consuming and expensive pro- cess. Revising an existing one is not much easier.Although the actual changes in the model are usually minor, this pro- cess requires: gathering new data, the evaluation of changes and their effect, re-implementation of decision support tools and verification of the new behavior. Models for continuous use are usually data-dependent and their updating can be au- tomated to some extent, if contemporary data about decision problem is available. Nowadays the abundance of available fresh information and the advances in data analysis meth- ods enable us to use data in various ways and to automate  even as creative processes as learning, pattern recognition, customer support and many others [3].

For qualitative multi-attribute models, there exist meth- ods for their data-based construction from scratch [4]. How- ever, these methods are complex, computationally demand- ing. Owing to the above reasons, the study on the revis- ing and launching automobile type is not involved by now.

The research addressed in this paper: an active involvement of experts and fuzzy set theory are employed in the multi- attribute model and decision support, business intelligence system are combined to carry out the research.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Pre- pared work and technique employed are briefly presented in section 2. In section 3, the proposed approach and algorithm in the model are defined and explained. The experimental results are described in section 4. Conclusions are given in section 5.

2. Prepared Work  2.1. Decision Support and Business Intelli- gence Integration  Decision support includes decision problem, decision- making, decision analysis, multi-attribute modeling[5].

Business intelligence utilizes data warehouse, OLAP and Data Mining to find out the knowledge that are contained in the data[6]. Among these, Data Mining is the most im- portant.There are many methods of data mining including classification,estimation,prediction, clustering, and affinity grouping. Among these, affinity grouping can discover the high frequency pattern and discover which things appear frequently and simultaneously. The goal of data mining is to find patterns in historical data that shed light on those needs, preferences, and propensities.

There are a lot of studies about the combination with de- cision support and business intelligence. They are:  1)Decision support for business intelligence.

2)Business intelligence for decision support.

4)Decision support, then Business intelligence.

5)Decision support and Business intelligence.

In this paper, 5) is utilized to build the model. The con-  crete work is discussed in section 3.

2.2. Fuzzy Set Theory  Fuzzy set theory was firstly presented by Professor L.A.Zadeh in California University in 1965. It transforms the meaning and spoken description into fuzzy set instead of general set, then studies and deals with subjective and un- defined data with membership functions, qualifies the data then transforms it into useful information through systemic fuzzy operations[7]. Fuzzy set theory and data mining tech- nique are often combined to solve the sharp boundary prob- lem. According to the principle, in this paper, a new associ- ation rule algorithm combined fuzzy set theory is employed to find the knowledge of multi-attribute(customer and auto- mobile).

3. Proposed Approach and Algorithm  In the study of revising and launching automobile type based on decision support and business intelligence sys- tem,this study combine automobile and customer by build- ing data warehouse. And employ expert knowledge to set the weight of automobile and customer. Then the bridge of multi-attribute(customer and automobile)is formed. In or- der to find the effective and scientific knowledge, a new as- sociation rule algorithm with weight is given to reflect their importance to the mining process.

3.1. Data Sources and Warehouse  In this model, Data sources come from sale and mainte- nance records. The attributes of automobile include price, comfort, safety, Engine, Transmission, and Size, etc. And the study also considers the extra expenditure of the au- tomobile. The attributes of customer include gender, age, City, and the way of buying automobile(money or loan), etc. The base of warehouse is built according to these at- tributes.The attribute tree of automobile and customer are shown in table 1 and table 2.

3.2. Experts Knowledge  The study builds the hierarchy of multi- attributes(customer and automobile). And employ expert knowledge and fuzzy set theory to set the weight of the multi-attributes. Here set Tr1, Tr2, Tr3, Tr4 as an example, their weight are 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.3.The weights table of automobile and customer is shown in table 3.

Weighted Association Rule Algorithm  The study organizes the items of automobile and cus- tomer as transactions. And consider a group of transactions D. A set of items I={i1, i2,???,in}. Each transaction is a subset of I, and is assigned a transaction identifer(TID)[8].

Definition 1 An association rule has the form X ? Y, where X? I, Y ? I, and X ? Y=?.

Definition 2 The support of the association rule X ? Y is the probability that X ? Y exists in a transaction in the database D.

Definition 3 The confidence of the association rule X ? Y is the probability that Y exists given that a transaction contains X, i,e.,     Table 2.

Y )/Pr(X) (1)  Given I, here assign a weight wj for each item ij by ex- pert knowledge, with 0 < wj 6 1, where j={1,2,???,n}, to show the importance of the item.

According to Definition 2, here can define the weighted support for the weighted association rules.

Definition 4 The weighted support of a rule X ? Y is? wj(Support(X ? Y )) (2)  Definition 5 A L-itemset X is called a small itemset if the weighted support itemset is less than the minimum weighted support(wminsup)threshold,or?  wj(Support(X ? Y ) < wminsup)) (3)  otherwise, X is a large L-itemset.

Definition 6 An association rule X ? Y is called inter- esting rule if X ? Y is a large itemset and the confidence, defined in definition (3), of the rule is greater than or equal to a minimum confidence threshold.

Here some transactions of automobile and customers are employed as an example to illustrate the algorithm.

There are 23 items and totally 10 transactions in the transaction database which is shown in table 4. (Here get these transactions from the different series of one type. So they have common things like H1, L1.)  Table 3.

Ac- cording to the same method, then can get other large item- set. At last, the association rules can get from definition 6.

Other interesting pattern can also come from the transac- tions. The transactions 1 to 5 come from the place Pl1, and the others come from the place Pl3.

There are 15 items and totally 5 transactions in the trans- actions 1 to 5. If the value of wminsup is 7, then {G2, S2, En2, P1, M1, A2, F , Pa1} will be a large item- set since (0.3+0.2+0.2+0.2+0.5+0.2+0.4+0.4)?(15/5)=7.2.

There are 17 items and totally 5 transactions in the transac- tions 6 to 10. If the value of wminsup is 7,then there will be no a large itemset. So the association rules coming from different region are different.

4. Experiments  The model of revising and launching automobile type was under tested . The model is based on decision support and business intelligence system. The interesting pattern and knowledge are yielded to help the decision makers to get the following results:  1)The revising automobile automobile type can be achieved combined this model.

2)The new automobile automobile type can be launched combined this model.

3)The business strategies are taken to the decision mak- ers by this model.

5. Conclusions  In the study to the model of revising and launching au- tomobile type, the model combines decision support and business intelligence system to do the research. Hierarchy multi-attributes are considered and a new association rule algorithm is yielded in the model. In the future, more work and experiments will serve as motivation for efforts in the development of revising and launching automobile type, to make the use the model more simple, more useful and more frequent.
