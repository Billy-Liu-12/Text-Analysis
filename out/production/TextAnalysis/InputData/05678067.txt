ABSTRACT  This paper explains how data analysis algorithms combined with a well-being modelling methodology are being employed to develop a new generation of telecare aimed at helping older people remain living more independently in their own homes for longer.  Intelligent data analysis in the form of fuzzy systems, trend analysis, pattern discovery, and association rules are applied to data obtained from non-invasive sensors to capture comprehensive information about a person?s daily activities. The Graphical User Interface (GUI) components of the Intelligent Wellbeing Monitoring System serve as a tool that increases the amount of information available to care professionals. These tools do not provide recommendations for action or make judgements as to the wellbeing of a client, instead they provide the means for a carer to investigate and track a client?s wellbeing.

INTRODUCTION  The ?Care in the Community? research programme has developed a range of low cost sensors which can detect simple events in a house, such as movement in a room, opening and closing of doors, and usage of household appliances and furniture. At the same time, a high level model of well-being has been produced, highlighting a number of activities such as eating and sleeping well, social interactions etc. which can be used as indicators of a person?s general well-being. Clearly it is not possible to convert very low level data, such as the times that kitchen appliances are used, into high level statements (the client is eating well) with 100% certainty. The role of intelligent data analysis in monitoring well-being is to bridge this gap. We combine human expertise with sensor data to draw  conclusions about well-being indicators with a high degree of accuracy and to draw attention to changes in behaviour (e.g. the client is sleeping significantly less during the night).

Telecare and telemedicine systems have been the centre of a number of research initiatives and commercial ventures over the past few years as a result of the desire to develop intelligent systems that support independent living for the elderly and the ill. There are currently a number of systems that enable the monitoring of specific physiological parameters (e.g. heart rate and blood pressure) using sensors that are connected to a central monitoring agency over a telecommunications network (1)(Nelwan, et al. (2)). Deviations from normal readings trigger alarms that the care agency or emergency services can respond to. However, the concept of wellbeing is not merely defined by physiological data being within normal boundaries.

In order to provide proper care provision for elderly people at their homes, their wellbeing must be defined more generally in terms of their physical, mental, social and environmental status. A change in wellbeing is usually reflected by changes in the daily activities of the person, which may not be immediately observable, but can be detected over a longer period of time. The technology survey in (Haigh and Yanco (3)) provides a comprehensive overview of a number of research programmes that focus on recognising behavioural changes and raising alerts if appropriate.

British Telecommunications plc (BT) has an established research track record in telecare with a number of projects and trials to investigate whether lifestyle monitoring could be used to provide a proactive support service to older or vulnerable people in the community (Garner, at al. (4), Barnes, et al. (5), Nauck and Majeed (6) and Rose, et al.

(7)). The most recent BT effort in this area is its Centre for Care in the Community, under the 'Next Wave Technologies and Markets' Programme, sponsored by the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). The centre oversees three inter-related activities. The first of these is carried out by the Domain Specific Modelling (DSM) group, which is responsible for developing an overall model of wellbeing in a number of vulnerable target groups, and to identify activities of daily living that are potentially affected by the deterioration of the wellbeing status (Brown, et al. (8)). The second     activity is concerned with the selection of sensor hardware that can be used to monitor the identified activities, and to set-up a sensor network in the home of the monitored person (Neild, et al. (9)).

The third part of the project is to develop an intelligent monitoring and analysis system. This system is responsible for analysing sensor data in order to detect subtle changes in the ability of a person to carry out their daily living activities, and to relate these to specific aspects of their wellbeing status.

The rest of this paper is dedicated to the design issues and results of the work carried out on the intelligent monitoring and analysis system. Section II provides an overview of the system. Section III outlines the data analysis techniques used, and delves into the details of the pre-processing and analysis required for one of the monitored activities. Section IV describes the GUI components and their reporting functionality.

Section V discusses how video observations are used to validate the results of the data analysis, while section VI contains the conclusions of this paper.

SYSTEM OVERVIEW  The sensor network employed in the early phase of this project included passive infrared (PIR) sensors  to pick up occurrences of movement in various rooms, supplemented by a few toggle switch sensors to detect when windows, entrances, and the fridge-freezer are opened. Although this provided a very restricted dataset consisting of few specific details about household events, plenty of information could still be inferred as to the general level of activity within the home, and the changing location of the client. This made it possible to determine the state of a number of activities of daily living. Data collected from the sensor network is stored in a logging unit in the home, then later transmitted in batches to the service provider over standard communication networks for placement on a database server. Results are analysed and updated automatically on the server each day. To access the information, carers make use of a user-friendly web interface where they can examine behaviours on a daily basis or changing trends in activities over time. The interface program runs entirely within the browser, which performs none of the analysis.

Instead results are retrieved from the database server, enabling a carer with permissions to access the data from any Internet linked computer.

Simplified summaries of key wellbeing indicators are also available for retrieval and display on PDA devices, adding extra convenience to those who spend much of their day out of office visiting clients. The overall structure of the system is shown in Figure 1.

User Interface  Interface to Sensor N etw  ork  Sensor Object Management  Analysis Algorithms  Raw Data  Pre- processing  Pre-Processed Data ReportData  Sensor Information  Report Generator  Figure 1 - System Structure  The system receives data from the sensor network and the ?Raw Data? database gets updated daily.

This data is then pre-processed to remove inconsistencies and to convert it to a more suitable format for use by the analysis algorithms. Whilst the sensors deployed in each home are very reliable, on occasion sensor information is missed through interference, multiple sensor messages  blocking each other, or some physical reason preventing detection. The pre-processing stage takes care of these problems by filling in the logical gaps and by filtering out implausible data. Logical gaps refer, for example, to missing OFF events in a toggle switch resulting in two consecutive ON events. Implausible data usually results from     incorrect sensor firing or communication network errors.

The sensor management unit is responsible for organising the sensors into activity-based sensor groups, which correspond with the activities of daily living that the domain specific modelling work has identified as essential for the wellbeing status (8). For example one group lists all sensors monitoring the home entrances, such that the system can attempt to infer when visitors arrive and the client goes out. All sensor specific information is stored in a sensor library so that it can be retrieved, modified, extended or deleted allowing the system to adapt to sensor network changes.

Aside from activity groups, sensor information includes sensor type (PIR, toggle switch, temperature, ?etc), location, data type (boolean, real,?etc), and nearby sensors. This information can then be used during pre-processing to help detect any inconsistencies in data received and to flag instances of sensor failure.

The system is equipped with a number of data analysis methods that convert the pre-processed data into answers to specific well-being status questions. These answers are conveyed to the user by the report generator through the main graphical user interface.

DATA ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES  The work of the DSM group concluded that the focus of this project should restrict itself to the frail elderly target group, and limit the number of monitored activities to just six (8), namely,  ? Leaving and returning home  ? Receiving visitors  ? Preparing food and eating  ? Sleeping patterns  ? Personal appearance  ? Leisure activities  A thorough understanding of each of these activities was needed in order to build a system that can monitor them. A number of questions relating to each of the activities were generated and posed to the data analysis team in order to provide answers that can indicate the status of the activity and its contribution to the well-being of the client.

The analysis methods include fuzzy reasoning, statistics, association analysis, and trend analysis (Berthold and Hand (10), Zadeh (11) and Kruse, et al. (12)). The following subsection describes in detail the data pre-processing and analysis approach taken to address one example of activity  monitoring, namely the client?s interaction with visitors. Similar methods have been used to monitor the other activities listed.

Visitor Detection Process  The purpose of the visitor detection process is to discover periods of time during which visitors are present in the house of a single-occupant client. The absence of intrusive sensing hardware such as personal identification tags and video cameras has introduced a degree of ambiguity in terms of the identity of the person performing an activity, and in terms of the number of people in the home at any one period of time. As a result, fuzzy reasoning methods are employed by the visitor detection process to establish a degree of confidence in the existence of visitors at any moment of time. The detection process runs through the input database in time order, noting important entrance events and periods classed as either active or inactive. Each time an entrance event is discovered in the database, the system analyses the periods immediately prior and subsequent to this event, such that changes in behaviour, perhaps caused by visitors can be assessed. This is achieved by scanning forwards and backwards through the summarised entrance data between periods where the house is recorded as empty, combining evidences of people entering and leaving to produce confidences of multiple occupancy at any one time.

Behavioural Comparisons The simplified data in Figure 2 shows motions detected (white) during a one-hour period in the home of a single occupancy client. The data segment has been split into three regions (A, B, C) according to the entrance events observed, such that each region denotes a time during which the number of persons in the home should remain constant. By comparing behaviours exhibited in regions neighbouring an entrance event, it is possible to determine those likely to correspond with persons arriving, leaving, or simply interacting with someone on the doorstep.

Figure 2 - An Example of Household Motion Detectors Data  Several characteristics of neighbouring regions may be compared, the choice of which is constrained by the type of data available. From the data gathered so far in the trials, we made the fuzzy comparisons     following. Figure 2 serves as an example case, but note that regions A and C continue beyond the boundaries of the graphic.

1. Activity Level [0,1] is defined as the proportion of time in which motion or object use was detected, so visually this is the average density of the white areas in the combined row for regions in Figure 2.

The assumption made is that as more people enter the home, so on average the number of activities detected will rise, and this difference in levels between the regions is converted to a fuzzy value for use in visitor detection rules.

Using an early section of the data as a training set, the system is able to normalise observed changes, and also adjust the default fuzzy sets to increase or decrease sensitivity as needed. In general, the more active the client, the more sensitive the system must be, as visitors cause less obvious observable impact on the data. Figure 3 shows an example of changes in sensitivity. The left side shows the default set definitions, best suited to a uniform distribution of activity changes. On the right, a more sensitive trained set was formed by averaging the default sets with the sets produced from the training data of one client.

Figure 3 - Fuzzy Sets Denoting Change in Activity Levels. Default sets (top) and Learned sets (bottom)  Note that we average an absolute (default) distribution with a relative (data) distribution, to avoid two main problems. The first is poor levels of sensitivity using absolute values, and the second is the problem of equal data splitting in the training set (e.g. Assuming 20% of changes in the training set are ?big rises? is clearly not correct). It is also important to realise that every home will have an individual set of sensors recording information, meaning that the amount of data collected can vary greatly from home to home. Depending on the type  of data collected, some homes will need more sensitive visitor detection than others. In a similar manner, the ?Changing Rooms? measure (see below) is converted to fuzzy values. An example value returned from the learned set based on the data in Figure 2 is A ? B = Big Rise 1.00.

2. Changing Rooms Level [0,1] is a measure of how often the room in which activities are currently detected changes. It is assumed that as visitors enter the home, some activities will take place simultaneously in different rooms, causing the data to apparently show very frequent changes. The value returned is based on the weighted average of three measures. 50% of the result is based upon the rate of apparent room changes. 25% comes from the ratio of those room changes deemed impossible for one person to make, e.g. lounge to bathroom, without passing through the hall. The last 25% comes from the longest sequence of impossible room changes. With a single occupant this level is usually very low, but in the case of two people in two separate rooms far apart in the home, long sequences of impossible room changes occur very frequently, in contrast making all three measures very high. For the example in Figure 2, there is no evidence of any impossible room changes; hence the changing rooms levels are not at all extreme.

Knowledge regarding impossible room changes is derived using two pieces of information, the first is the sensor installation information, which provides accessibility information about each sensor location. The second piece of information is developed during the training period, and it shows the probability of room changes during that period.

The result returned for regions A and B in this case is  A? B = Steady 0.189, Rise 0.811.

3. Delay Time is a measure of how long it takes before the activity level shows signs of the change recorded. This is obtained by use of a sliding window, and the delay is the time taken before the activity level within the window is closer to the activity level for the second region than the first.

Figure 4 - Activity Levels for Regions A, B, and a Sliding Window W  In Figure 4, the very first window has an activity level closer to that of region B than A, hence the delay time in this case is zero, an instantaneous change. Short delays such as this are consistent with changes to the number of persons in the home, while long delays are more consistent with a     coincidental later change in behaviour, such as a person becoming more active to cook dinner.

A? B = Short 1.000 4. Hallway Time either side of a door event adds more clues, such as whether or not a person has been let in, seen out, or is taking off and unpacking some items after coming inside. Unfortunately the data used to calculate this period is difficult to accurately assess, as the data may show a change in room because of a single person leaving the hall, or a second person moving in another room. The current implementation may cause occasional underestimates of the true value, whereas an implementation using a window either side of an entrance event would cause overestimates. Again, values for the data in Figure 2 are given.

Before: A ? B = Zero, After: A ? B = Short 1.000  5. Door Open Time is the time during which the door was open. Longer times imply a higher likelihood of visitors remaining outside if there is no evidence of others entering the home; otherwise, a long time is consistent with guests bringing items inside.

A? B = Short 1.000  Note that the various parameter values and default settings listed in this analysis are not hard-coded, and are instead stored in a parameter database. This allows for simple manual changes to the algorithms and the possibility of creating a data-scanning program that could determine the optimal settings.

Applying the Fuzzy Rules Once the data has been converted into fuzzy descriptions, fuzzy rules can be applied to describe the likelihood that visitors did indeed arrive and leave during those door events. These rules are mainly derived by domain experts, with the help of sensor and data analysis experts. For example, as the house is occupied by at least one person in regions A & B, the visitor entry rules matching the data given by the AB door event are listed below. (Note that the output of the rules is a fuzzy set):  Rule 1: If hallway time before a door event is zero then visitors = likely. (Implies visitor is also a key holder).

Membership for Likely = 1.

Rule 2: If delay time is short, and activity levels are some rise, and changing rooms levels are some rise, and time in hallway after door shuts is short, then visitors arrived = probably.

Membership for Probably = 0.811.

Rule 3: If delay time is short, and activity levels are a big rise, and changing rooms levels are steady,  and time in hallway after door shuts is short, then visitors arrived = fifty-fifty.

Membership for Fifty-Fifty = 0.189.

Note: ?some rise? is a fuzzy set whose function is equivalent to the sum of the functions used for ?rise? and ?big rise?. The functions ?rise? and ?big rise? are also defined such that where these sets overlap, the sum of their membership functions is always 1.

Figure 5 - Fuzzy Output for Visitor Entry at the AB Door Event  As shaded grey in Figure 5, employing various rules can result in differing assessments of the data.

To defuzzify these results, the horizontal centre of gravity of the shaded area, denoted c in the graph, is taken as the consensus of opinion. Dependant on its use, either the value 0.841 or a description such as ?quite likely? could be returned.

As no person was detected in the hall immediately before the door event, it could be argued a visitor must have arrived. However, this may have been caused by a sensor failing to detect the person, which occasionally happens. By taking account of multiple pieces of evidence, the results returned are much more reliable, suffering from fewer large errors.

The door event BC also has a high probability for visitors leaving at that point. This would be considered along with the AB result to reach a conclusion that there is a strong likelihood that the twenty-minute period of region B was associated with a visitor in the home.

THE USER INTERFACE (GUI) COMPONENTS  Users interact with the system using a number of GUI components such as the sensor management component and the parameter setting component.

The component of main interest however, is the data display and analysis component which displays the analysis results to the caregiver. The GUI is split into two main components, namely the calendar view and the analysis reporting views.

These views are discussed below together with some of the data analysis aspects behind them.

The Calendar View  The calendar view is shown in Figure 6 in greyscale. The original view uses a colouring scheme to convey information to the user. This view allows the user to select individual days for detailed examination, and highlights days where unusual activity has taken place. The coloured controls on the calendars indicate the normality of the daily patterns. The dates in any of yellow, blue, or green colours are likely to contain unusual events in comparison to the learnt normal behaviour according to the following scheme (unfortunately it is difficult to see these effects on the greyscale image)  ? Yellow indicates the amount of normally occurring events that are missing.

? Blue represents the amount of unusual extra events observed.

? Green illustrates a combination of both missing and extra events.

? Pale Red means the day is ignored in the analysis process, usually because the day doesn?t have enough data due to sensor or communication failure.

The intensity of colour (apart from red) indicates the degree of abnormality, so a brighter yellow indicates a greater number of missing events for example. The normal behaviour is learnt from the history of the data using a combination of fuzzy logic, statistics and association rule mining.

Figure 6 - The Calendar View  THE ANALYSES REPORTING VIEWS  A number of views provide specific information regarding the well-being status questions discussed earlier. The first daily activity plot displays sensor data and inferred activities of the client on the currently selected day. This is composed of the control panel on the left side and a 24-hour coloured plot of data on the right, as shown in Figure 7 (Note that the original view is colour intensive). The plot contains three groups of information from the pre-processed sensor data, each of which are fully listed for selection in the control panel:  1. Activity group - The first group, forming the majority of the view, lists all the individual sensors, for example, front door open/close, bed occupied, kitchen PIR, etc. This first group also contains the 'activity' level (constructed as the aggregate of all PIR sensor firings in 5 minute periods) and 'silence' (long periods where no data was observed).

2. Location group - The second group lists all the individual PIR sensors Their data is condensed onto one timeline with coloured stripes representing the rooms where and when motions were detected.

3. Abstract group - The third group contains the abstracted activities such as ASLEEP, OUT, INACTIVE, VISITOR, and BATH.

The VISITOR activity differs from the others in that its colour is displayed brighter (toward yellow) as the confidence for a visitor being present increases. The confidence level is a result of applying fuzzy reasoning as described in detail in Section

III. In addition to ASLEEP, there are also the minor activities of DRIFTING, WAKING, and STIRRING events that indicate the periods before, after and disturbances during the sleep periods respectively. These and all other activities are inferred by analysing the data from the relevant sensor activity group.

Figure 7 - Daily Activity View  Another important view is used to display changes of the wellbeing-related values such as sleeping, eating, going out, and having visitors. Original values, their moving average, plus changes in trend can all be shown. To make the system user- friendly, analyses are chosen from a list of  questions relating to wellbeing and derived from the wellbeing model of the DSM group. For example, ?Is the duration of the main sleep-period increasing or decreasing?? has been selected in Figure 8, and the time the client has spent sleeping over the past month is automatically displayed.

Figure 8 - Trend Plot of the Sleep Activity  RESULTS VALIDATION  For validation, simple diary style records are collected by occasionally telephoning the client about their day over a period of several weeks, supplemented by a week of video footage where clients will be filmed doing non-private activities in limited areas of their home. The first purpose of validation is to assess the system, both in terms of sensor performance and activities detected. The second is to help identify how the sensor network could be improved such that clearer data is  produced. Currently five major activity types are inferred. These are sleeping, going out, hosting visitors, extended bathroom use, plus inactivity.

Some video evidence has been examined, although due to the restrictions on the allowed camera position, there is no video with which to confirm sleeping or bathroom activities. Inactive periods are simply defined by an absence of sensor data, and the video shows the client almost motionless usually reading or watching television during these times. Of the remaining activities, the video has so far shown the telecare system correctly determines     periods when the client is out and visitors are in the home, although the system can on occasion be fooled into inferring a visitor by unusual client behaviour.

Example Going Out:  Known Start Time Known End Time Inferred Start Time  Inferred End Time  22/08/05, 14:16:00 17:08:00  14:16:44 17:07:59 23/08/05, 13:53:00 15:52:00  13:53:04 15:52:43  Example Visitors:  The column ?Conf.? lists the confidence with which the system believes a visitor is present. The confidence figure is a percentage representation of  the fuzzy value resulting from applying the rules, for example a centre of gravity of 50 is displayed as 50%.

Known Start Time  Known End Time Inferred Start Time  Inferred End Time  Conf.

30/08/05, 11:03:39 11:35:21 11:03:39 11:35:21 61% N/A N/A 30/08/05, 11:35:21 11:42:39 48%  30/08/05, 11:42:49 11:47:56 11:42:39 11:47:56 75%  In the above case, the system has given a 48% confidence of a visitor being present during a period when there was none. This is in large part due to the system assuming that one possibility to explain the data is that the time from 11:03:39 to 11:47:56 is just one long visit, and the period 11:35:21 to 11:42:39 is simply a quieter period with less apparent room changes and coincidental entrance events.

Figure 9 compares the data from the periods described above (left) and data from 23/08/05  starting from 10:20 am and continuing till 11:20 am (right). The confidences of the visitor periods illustrated in this second case are 57% and 49% respectively, and their data looks very similar to that of the first visitor period starting at 11:03am on 30/08/05. The second case was caused by the client cleaning the home, starting with the entrance, causing an entrance event to be associated with a significant change in household activity.

Figure 9 - Similar Data from Actual Visits (left) and Cleaning by the Client (right)  In both cases it appears possible that early in the periods one person could be using the bathroom  whilst the other is elsewhere in the home. However the rest of the data shows virtually no evidence of     two rooms being occupied at once, although compared to data outside the range of these graphics, the activity level is significantly higher between the relevant entrance events. The system thus reports visiting periods with relatively low confidences to reflect the level of uncertainty.

Several parameters within the visitor detection process can be changed, and by comparing data from further actual visits to detected visits, optimal values for each of our parameters can be reached.

So far however, too few actual visits have been identified with which to confidently determine adjustments that would increase accuracy in the majority of cases.

Aside from the activities already discussed, the recently extended sensor network has also provided the opportunity to infer further activities relating to food preparation and piped water usage, plus  watching television and using the phone. However, detailed validation information has only very recently become available, and the time-consuming examination and comparisons with sensor reported and inferred results continues along with development of their inference methods. However, current observations indicate that phone usage is detected very accurately and television viewing is largely inferred correctly, although as these sensors record interaction with the devices, this is as expected.

Example Television Watching:  The major assumption made about watching television is that the client would be seemingly inactive for several minutes at a time, hence this is basically an adaptation from the inactivity detection.

Known Start Time Known End Time Inferred Start Time  Inferred End Time  20/08/05, 17:15:33 17:23:40 20/08/05, 17:15:19 18:26:14  20/08/05, 17:24:58 18:26:18 20/08/05, 18:37:05 00:09:45  N/A N/A 20/08/05, 21:01:30 21:07:52  20/08/05, 21:01:45 21:08:42 20/08/05, 21:19:09 21:32:14  20/08/05, 21:14:20 21:32:03 20/08/05, 22:05:35 22:36:20  20/08/05, 22:08:12 22:33:19  The first watching period has had two separate periods inferred, as between these periods the client is very active presumably cleaning up after finishing the snack eaten during the first period.

The second short viewing period was not detected because the client was constantly active after a phone call and then left the room. The third period was detected very accurately, and the fourth period is only ?inaccurate? in starting time because the client was reading a newspaper for five minutes whilst having the television on. The fifth inferred period is a slightly smaller than the actual period due to the high activity whilst the client settles down and later begins to leave the room.

Note that errors with determining television viewing occur because we have no knowledge as to whether or not the television is actually on nor can we tell if the client is actually looking at the television or just has it on in the background. We do have several methods for easily increasing the accuracy of these specific results, but more validation data needs to be examined before we can be justified in applying these methods to all the data.

CONCLUSIONS  Telecare systems aim to carry out intelligent analyses of a person?s wellbeing using data about their daily activities. This is a very challenging task for a number of reasons. First of all, the sensors were designed to be completely non-intrusive which excludes the use of any form of tagging for personal identification. This means that the decision reached by any analysis algorithm will always contain a degree of ambiguity in terms of the identity of the person performing an activity, and in terms of the number of people in the home at any one period of time.

The second issue is related to the fact that people tend to change their behaviour and perform unpredictable actions that cannot be learnt.

Combined with the type of sensors that can be used, this means that the ability of the data analysis engine to make decisions has a significant error rate. For example, consider the bed sensors, which cannot distinguish between a person lying in bed from a heavy object placed on the bed. The fact is that no matter how many sensors are installed, the decision making process will always be associated with some uncertainty. This is why all the data is processed using the techniques of fuzzy systems,     which exploit the tolerance for imprecision and uncertainty.

The third factor is related to evidence collection for the purpose of learning and validation of the analysis results. In this project, simple diary style records are collected by occasionally telephoning the client about their day over a period of several weeks, supplemented by a week of video footage where clients are filmed doing non-private activities in limited areas of their home. The problem with the diary records is that they introduce an element of intrusion that can become a nuisance for the clients after a period of time and leads to them not treating it seriously enough to record their activities correctly. As for the video evidence, cameras were not installed in bedrooms or bathrooms for privacy reasons and thus they provide an incomplete picture of the activities.

In spite of limited sensor information, we have shown that it is possible to answer the majority of questions regarding a person?s behaviour and wellbeing. Periods of sleep and where the client leaves the home are easily monitored, allowing for effective normality modelling and long-term trend analyses of these periods.

Although many other important events such as preparing meals, preparing to go out, and hosting visitors have proved more difficult to accurately infer, the measures produced are still worthy of tracking over time. If for instance there is a decrease in the amount and confidence of visits detected, it is likely that visitor numbers have indeed dropped, and the rough data has thus served its desired purpose. Eliminating all uncertainties is clearly impossible with the sensors employed in this study, and it is likely that no matter what sensors are deployed in a fully non-invasive system, this problem will remain to a certain degree. The challenge therefore remains of how to extract the maximum amount of knowledge using a system that imposes a minimum level of intrusion.
