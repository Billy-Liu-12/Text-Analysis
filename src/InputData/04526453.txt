QuakeSim: Efficient Modeling of Sensor Web Data in a Web Services Environment

Abstract QuakeSim is a project to develop a modeling environment for studying earthquake processes using a web services environment. In order to model interseismic processes multiple data types must be ingested including spaceborne GPS and InSAR data, geological fault data, and seismicity data. QuakeSim federates data from these multiple sources and integrates the databases with modeling applications. Because the models are complex and compute intensive we are using the Columbia computer located at NASA Ames to integrate and run software programs to improve our understanding of the solid Earth and earthquake processes. The complementary software programs are used to simulate interacting earthquake fault systems, model nucleation and slip on faults, and calculate run-up and inundation from tsunamis generated by offshore earthquakes. QuakeSim also applies pattern recognition techniques to real and simulated data to elucidate subtle features in the processes. 1 2  1 1-4244-1488-1/08/$25.00 C 2008 IEEE.
