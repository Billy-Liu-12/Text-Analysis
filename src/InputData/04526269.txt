A Benchmark Study: Comparison Between HETC-HEDS and Experimental Data

Abstract Experiments have been carried out at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) to obtain charge- changing cross sections and partial cross sections for fragmentation of 1.05 GeV/nucleon Fe projectiles incident on H, C, Al, Cu, and Pb nuclei. We have simulated the fragmentation experiments using the newly developed High Energy Transport Code for Human Exploration and Development in Space (HETC-HEDS) and included comparisons of fragment fluences and energy deposited as a part of code validation. We have found the results obtained from experiments to compare very well with the model when all experimental corrections are applied to the simulations. 12  TABLE OF CONTENTS
