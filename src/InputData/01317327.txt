Case-Control Study of Binary Disease Trait Considering Interactions between SNPs and Environmental Effects using Logistic Regression

Abstract  In this paper, we propose a combination of logistic re- gression and genetic algorithm for the association study of the binary disease trait. We use a logistic regression model to describe the relation of multiple SNPs, environments and the target binary trait. The logistic regression model can capture the continuous effects of environments without cat- egorization, which causes the loss of the information. To construct an accurate prediction rule for binary trait, we adopted Akaike information criterion (AIC) to find the most effective set of SNPs and environments. That is, the set of SNPs and environments that gives the smallest AIC is cho- sen as the optimal set. Since the number of combinations of SNPs and environments is usually huge, we propose the use of the genetic algorithm for choosing the optimal SNPs and environments in the sense of AIC. We show the effec- tiveness of the proposed method through the analysis of the case/control populations of diabetes patients. We succeeded in finding an efficient set to predict types of diabetes and some SNPs which have strong interactions to age while it is not significant as a single locus.

1. Introduction  Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most frequent genomic variations. A large number of SNPs have been developed, and genome-wide associa- tion study has been proposed to identify complex trait loci [8]. This kind of association study is roughly di- vided into two categories; case-control study and transmis- sion disequilibrium test (TDT) [10, 11]. Although TDT has the advantage on handling the population stratifica- tion as a cause of false positive association, case-control study is still popular because independent individual data  under case-control design is far easier to gather than fam- ily data for TDT. Because of this low cost of case-control study, we may expect more data and more precise analy- sis.

Traits are often controlled by multiple genes and envi- ronments, and the researchers have been paying attention to the interactions among genes and environments. How- ever, since the contribution of each genetic and environmen- tal effect is relatively small [3, 5, 9], it is difficult to de- tect these interactions by testing each locus separately. Re- cently, several methods have been proposed to estimate the combinations of loci interacting with each other. Classifica- tion tree method [13] constructs a tree splitting the sample individuals into the nodes by the genotype of SNPs. Pro- portion of case/control individuals is tested at each node, and the tree giving highly biased case/control proportion is searched. Combinatorial partitioning [7] divides the sam- ples by the genotypes of any two SNPs. Phenotypic vari- ance explained by this partitioning is tested for each combi- nation of two SNPs, and the combination giving high expla- nation rate is searched. Sum-statistics methods [4, 12] cal- culate the test statistics at each SNP based on simple meth- ods, such as ANOVA, and finds the set of SNPs that max- imizes the sum of each statistics. Generally, these methods are powerful but difficult to consider the continuous effect of the environment, especially for the interaction between SNPs and environments. Furthermore, the evaluation of the statistical significance is unclear, and they require empiri- cal threshold, such as permutation test, to search the opti- mal combination of SNPs, and they require heavy calcula- tion when analyzing a huge number of SNPs. So, we need to construct a statistic model considering multiple SNPs, envi- ronmental effects and their interactions simultaneously.

In this paper, we propose a combination of logistic re- gression and genetic algorithm for the association study of the binary disease trait. We use a logistic regression model to describe the relation of multiple SNPs, environments and  Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE Symposium on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering (BIBE?04)    the target binary trait. The logistic regression model can capture the affection of multiple SNPs, continuous effects of environments and their interactions to the binary trait based on a probabilistic model. When we know the cor- rect relationship among them completely, we can construct a prediction rule for binary trait by estimating the parame- ters in the correct model. However, the effect of SNPs and environments to the trait is generally unknown. Therefore, we need to find the most effective set of SNPs and envi- ronments to predict the trait from a statistical point of view.

This problem can be considered as a statistical model selec- tion problem. When the parameter estimation is done by the maximum likelihood method, the Akaike information crite- rion (AIC) [1, 2] can provide an efficient solution from a predictive viewpoint. That is, the set of SNPs and environ- ments that gives the smallest AIC is chosen as the optimal set of them.

On the other hand, since the number of combinations of SNPs and environments is usually large, the optimization of the set of SNPs and environments is a difficult problem.

Moreover, this optimization is sometimes impossible when we consider a huge number of SNPs. To solve this problem, we propose the use of the genetic algorithm (GA) for choos- ing the optimal SNPs and environments in the sense of AIC.

In our GA, candidates for the SNPs are encoded as ?geno- types?, and AIC as ?fitness?.

In Section 2.1, we introduce the logistic regres- sion model to predict the binary trait by using the in- formation of multiple SNPs, environmental effects and their interactions. The estimation method of the parame- ters in the logistic regression model is described in Section 2.2. Akaike?s information criterion for selecting infor- mative SNPs and environmental effects is introduced in Section 2.3 together with the genetic algorithm for solv- ing the optimization problem. In Section 3, we show the effectiveness of the proposed method through the anal- ysis of the case/control populations of diabetes patients [14].

2. Method for Predicting Binary Trail  2.1. Logistic Regression Model  We consider a population of independent individuals. We randomly sample a number of cases (affected by disease) and controls (not affected) from this population, and ob- serve the genotypes of candidate SNPs and environmental factors for each individual. The probability of affection, p, is described by the logistic regression model using the lin- ear combination of the SNPs and environmental factors as:  p =  1 + exp(z) , (1)  where  z = ? + Ns? i=1  ?ixi + Ns?1? i=1  Ns? j=i+1  ?ijxixj (2)  + Ne? k=1  ?kek + Ns? i=1  Ne? k=1  ?ikxiek.

Here, Ns is the number of SNPs associated with this dis- ease, and Ne is the number of observed environmental fac- tors. The observation of the ith SNP xi (i = 1, . . . , Ns) is defined by  xi = {  1, if the ith SNP is observed, 0, if the ith SNP is not observed.

The observation xi may be both single SNP observation and the observation of the haplotype set. When considering the haplotype set, estimation of the haplotype frequencies also is required as a preprocessing of the data. The environmen- tal factor ek (k = 1, . . . , Ne) allows both discrete and con- tinuous value. ?, ?i, ?ij , ?k and ?ik are parameters esti- mated by data. The 3rd and 5th terms of the right hand side of equation (2) are the interactions between the ith and jth SNPs and between the ith SNP and kth environment, re- spectively.

The advantage of the logistic model is the handling of the continuous effect of environments. Other methods we mentioned in the introduction part also can incorporate en- vironmental factor, but they need to categorize the environ- mental effects by some thresholds which causes the loss of the information. The logistic model is free from this prob- lem.

2.2. Estimation of Parameters  We use the maximum likelihood method for estimating the parameters, ?, ?i, ?ij , ?k and ?ik, in the logistic re- gression model. Suppose that we have Ns SNPs and Ne environment factors of N samples. The logistic regression model for the nth (n = 1, . . . , N ) observation can be ex- pressed as:  pn =  1 + exp(zn) , (3)  where  zn = ? + Ns? i=1  ?ixni + Ns?1? i=1  Ns? j=i+1  ?ijxnixnj (4)  + Ne? k=1  ?kenk + Ns? i=1  Ne? k=1  ?ikxnienk.

Suppose yn is the indicator that expresses whether the nth observation is affected by disease (yn = 1) or not (yn = 0).

Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE Symposium on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering (BIBE?04)    The likelihood function can be written of the form  L(?) = N?  n=1  pynn (1 ? pn)1?yn . (5)  The maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) ?? is obtained as the maximizer of L(?).

The MLE ?? is obtained as the solution of ? log L(?)/?? = 0. However, this equation is nonlin- ear in ? for the logistic regression model and we use the Newton-Raphson method [6] to compute ??.

2.3. Selection of SNPs and Environmental Factors  The MLE ?? can be obtained when we set the set of SNPs and environmental factors as the candidates for pre- dicting the trait. However, the relationship between disease and SNPs and environment factors is generally unknown.

Therefore, we need to select the set of SNPs and envi- ronmental factors from the data in practice. This problem can be viewed as a statistical model selection problem. To choose the best set of SNPs and environment factors, we use Akaike?s information criterion, known as AIC:  AIC = ?2 log L(??) + 2#{?}, (6) where #{?} is the number of parameters included in the model. The optimal model, i.e. the optimal set of SNPs and environment factors, is obtained as the minimizer of AIC.

For the logistic regression model given in (3) and (4), the number of parameters is {(Ns + 2Ne)(Ns + 1) + 2}/2 and the AIC is defined as  AIC = ?2 log L(??) + (Ns + 2Ne)(Ns + 1) + 2. (7) For choosing the optimal set of SNPs and environment  factors, we need to compute the score of AIC for all possi- ble combinations. In practice, the exhaustive search is just not realistic, because the number of combinations of SNPs and environment factors is huge. To solve this problem, we perform the genetic algorithm (GA) for choosing the bet- ter set of SNPs and environment factors as follows:  GA genotype and fitness: We simply use the list of SNPs as the GA genotype, and AIC described in (7) as the GA fitness.

GA selection: A number of the GA individuals are ex- tracted from the GA population, and the one with the high- est fitness is adopted as a parent. The same procedure of par- ent selection is repeated twice without replacement for each GA offspring (Fig.1).

GA mutation of slight modification: To avoid the pre- mature convergence to the local optima, we introduce very slight mutation occurring with the probability proportional to the number of identical GA individuals. This additional mutation randomly selects a SNP from the GA genotype and shifts it to an adjacent SNP.

and slight mutations. Regarding the certainty of the search rather than the speed, we settled on the number of GA indi- viduals being 200, the tournament size was two, the rate of the drastic GA mutation was 0.1, and the rate of slight mu- tation was set to be 0.3 of the number of identical GA indi- viduals to a newly created GA individual.

Finally, we would like to show a conceptual chart of our proposed method in Fig.4 as a summarization of this sec- tion.

3. Analysis of Diabetes Patients Data  We analyze the case/control populations of diabetes pa- tients served in mtSNP database [14]. The data is consisted of normal type II diabetes patients (control) and type II di- abetes patients with angiopathy (case), and each population is consisted of 96 Japanese patients. The mitochondrial SNP genotype and the age are observed for each patient. Totally, 720 SNPs are observed in these populations. Since mito- chondrial DNA is the haploid, we can observe the SNP hap-  Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE Symposium on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering (BIBE?04)    Table 1.

Here, we consider the age as an environmen- tal factor to apply our method.

The results of this analysis can be summarized as fol- lows: We found seven SNPs in the optimal model (Ta- ble 1); SNP1 at the 6455th base in CO1 (cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1), SNP2 at the 11647th base in ND4 (NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4), SNP3 at the 14470th base in ND6 (NADH dehydrogenase subunit 6), SNP4 at the 15874th base in Cytb (Cytochrome b) and SNP5, 6, 7 at the 16217th, 16261st and 16291st base in the non-coding region. Table 2 shows the estimates and p-values of the pa- rameters of the optimal model. We observed that interac- tion ?SNP2 and SNP7? and strong interactions ?age and SNP3? and ?age and SNP7?.

Using this optimal model, we applied leave-one-out cross-validation to evaluate the effectiveness of the pro- posed method in terms of predicting diabetes type. Type I (true negative) and Type II (false positive) error rates were 0.1256 and 0.1147, respectively. Therefore, total er- ror rate was 0.2403.

Since the optimal model based on AIC may be easily  changed by the fluctuation of the data, significant SNPs may be excluded from the optimal model. Therefore, we next checked the 2nd or lower ranked models. Table 3 shows the SNPs included in the 1st to 20th ranked model by GA. We observed that the seven SNPs detected in the optimal model frequently appear in the lower ranked models; i.e., SNP1, ? ? ?, SNP7 appear 8, 9, 16, 17, 13, 20 and 14 times, re- spectively. Although almost all the other SNPs appear a few times, three times or less, we found a SNP at the 5417th base, which is not contained in the optimal model, appears six times in Table 3. This SNP, namely SNP8, is in ND2 (NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2) and appears first in the 3rd optimal model. We found an interesting behavior of SNP8. In the 3rd model, the main effect of SNP8 is weak (? = ?0.1999, p-value = 0.1207), the interaction between SNP8 and age is, however, fairly strong (? = 2.5578, p-value = 0.1179). Since the differences of AIC among these 20 models are not large, we need to pay attention to the SNPs not contained in the optimal model when using these results to the group recognition or prediction of bi- nary traits.

4. Discussion  We proposed the combination of the logistic regression and the genetic algorithm for the association study of bi- nary disease trait. By the use of logistic regression, we could directly incorporate the continuous effects of envi- ronments into the model without loss of information. Of course, other conventional methods also can incorporate the environmental effects, but the categorization is required to transfer the continuous effects into some discrete classes by some thresholds, and causes the loss of information. Actu- ally, we succeeded in detecting SNPs which are not signif- icant as a single locus but have strong interactions to the environmental factor. Therefore, we expect to utilize the in- formation of the environments more effectively for the fur- ther discoveries in the association analysis.

We consider the following problems of our method as future work: (1) We adopted AIC as the criterion for the model selection. As we mentioned in the experiment sec- tion, the optimal model detected by AIC may be changed by the fluctuation of the observed data. Therefore, we have to pay attention to the 2nd or lower ranked models. A possi- ble way to do this is constructing a posterior distribution of the model using the frequency of the SNP appearance. (2) We used a single SNP as a variable of the logistic regression model, but it is often the case that closely linked SNPs yield highly correlated information because of extensive linkage disequilibrium. Therefore, we need to select a subset of ad- jacent SNPs and use them as a single variable of the regres- sion model. In that case, we need to construct a method of haplotype selection and estimation into the SNP search of  Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE Symposium on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering (BIBE?04)    Table 3.

(3) The use of the logistic regression has many other merits. We can statistically evaluate the ac- curacy and reliability of the estimation because the result is provided as the posterior probability. We also can extend our model for handling nonlinear behavior of genetic or en- vironmental factors. Furthermore, we can extend the con- ventional two-group recognition (susceptible or not suscep- tible) to more precise multi-group recognition. We would like to investigate these topics in our future paper.
