Abstract-- The electrophoretic display (EPD) has become the main stream of the panel used in consumer electronic readers.

However, getting more than 16 gray levels on an EPD is still a big challenge. In this paper, we propose an image processing tool that combines contrast enhancement and modified error diffusion halftoning to deal with the problems on the image conversion process. The experimental results show that the processed image has higher contrast for image textures and maintains good visibility after the data are quantized into 16 gray levels.



I. INTRODUCTION The requirements of an electronic reader include ultra-low  power, high reflectance, good contrast ratio, wide viewing angle, and long time image stability. An electrophoretic display (EPD), which consists of many charged particles with white or black colors in a clear or colored fluid, offers good performance to meet these requirements [1], [2]. However, very few commercial EPDs can display color images, although it can be achieved by laminating a color filter array on the EPD. Converting a true color image to a gray tone image that keeps good visibility becomes a necessary process for an EPD.

Displaying 256 gray levels is still a big challenge with current available electophoretic materials [3], [4]. Gray tones in an EPD can be obtained by varying the amplitude or pulse width of a driving waveform for controlling the number of charged particles in the viewing side. Lots of driving waveforms have been proposed, however, the number of gray levels supported in a commercial EPD panel is only 4 to 16.

An alternative approach can achieve more gray levels by spatial dithering, but it reduces equivalent resolution or generates undesired artifacts. The issues of mapping a high dynamic range image to an EPD are not well addressed yet.

In this paper, we propose an integrated image processing tool that converts a true color image to a quantized gray tone one, particularly useful for an EPD. Other than the necessary color to gray tone conversion, the tool enhances image contrast and quantizes the image to 16 levels with modified error diffusion halftoning [5], [6]. The proposed halftoning method simultaneously reduces visible quantized errors and maintains image textures.

Finally, the tool quantizes the image data to 16 gray levels with the modified error diffusion halftoning method.

A. Convert to a Gray Tone Image An input image is first converted into a gray tone one by  recording the luminance component (L*) for all pixels in CIELAB color space. The components of L*, a*, and b* can be calculated by (1)-(5), where Xn, Yn, and Zn are the tristimulus values of the reference (neutral) white point.

Contrast Enhancement The concept of the proposed contrast enhancement  algorithm is to expand the contrast of image details by assigning larger dynamic range for more image textures. It first extracts the edges with a popular detector called Sobel  Image Quality Improvement for Electrophoretic Displays by Combining Contrast Enhancement and Halftoning Techniques  Wen-Chung Kao, Senior Member, IEEE, Jia-An Ye, and Craig Lin       operator. Then all extracted edges are assigned to the M histogram bins , 1kHB k M? ? , according to their original L* luminance values. The cumulative frequency distribution function ( ( ), 1t j j M? ? ) is calculated as (6), where  ( ), 1h k k M? ? , denotes the histogram value for the bin k.

(6)  Assuming the entire dynamic range of luminance value L* is initially normalized to the range of 0 to 100, for a pixel x with value , (100 / ) ( 1) (100 / )x xL j M L j M? ? < + ? , it is initially assigned to the j-th bin. The target luminance value of pixel x should be moved to the p-th bin, where  ( )p M t j= ? after histogram equalization.

C. Gamma Correction The electro-optical response of an EPD is generally  nonlinear and it is quite different from CRT/LCD display.

The compensation gamma curve should be determined by calibrating the panel characteristics.

D. Halftoning Unlike traditional approaches [5], the proposed halftoning  method performs error diffusion only on those uniform color regions that have similar colors and bypasses the regions that contain image edges. The edge information is passed from the previous stage. The uniform region near a pixel i can be examined by *ia?  and  * ib? as stated in (7) and (8), where  * ia ,  * ia ,  * ib , and  * ib denote the  *a value of a pixel i,  the  average *a value of the neighboring pixels of the pixel i, *b value of the pixel i, and the average *b value of the  neighboring pixels of the pixel i, respectively.

*** ii aaai ?=?  (7) ***  ii bbbi ?=?  (8)  If both *ia?  and * ib?  are smaller than a threshold value,  the pixel i can be recognized as locating in a uniform color region.

We assume the EPD panel originally supports 16 gray levels, and a color image has been converted to the one with 256 gray levels through the previous stages. Then each pixel is first quantized to the 16 gray levels and the quantized error is diffused to the neighboring pixels only if the current pixel is located in uniform color region and the current pixel is not an edge pixel.



III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS We have implemented the proposed image processing  algorithm. The experimental results of all processing stages for an image are shown in Fig.2. It is easy to find the final image shown in Fig.2-(f) and (h) use only 16 gray levels and they have much better visual quality than the one without  contrast enhancement (Fig.2-(c)) or the ones without halftoning process (Fig.2-(e) and (g)). It is worth noting that halftoning process does not reduce the image contrast of fine textures due to the reason that halftoning is performed only on those pixels that are not edge pixels.
