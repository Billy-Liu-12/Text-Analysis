On the Importance of Fuzzy Attribute Implications

Abstract? Our paper deals with the expressive power of fuzzy attribute implications which are if-then rules describing dependencies among graded attributes. In our previous work, we have shown that fuzzy attribute implications are important in data mining because they can be used as a concise description of all if-then dependencies which are hidden in object-attribute fuzzy relational data. Fuzzy attribute implications can be seen as formulas (in the narrow sense) of the form A ? B where both A and B are conjunctions of subformulas containing constants for truth degrees acting as (constants for) threshold truth degrees. This paper investigates possibility to replace sets of fuzzy attribute implications with fuzzy sets of ordinary if- then formulas in the sense of Pavelka?s abstract logic. We reveal the impossibility to replace fuzzy attribute implications by the ordinary formulas without losing their expressive power. From the technical point of view, we present counterexamples demon- strating that fuzzy sets of the ordinary attribute implications cannot be used to describe sets of fixed points of arbitrary fuzzy closure operators.



I. INTRODUCTION  IF-THEN rules describing dependencies among attributesare the subject of study of various disciplines. The rules appear as association rules in data mining, attribute  implications in formal concept analysis [9], and functional  dependencies in relational database systems [14]. In their  basic setting, the rules describe dependencies among Boolean  yes/no attributes. That is, validity of such rules is considered  with respect to the fact that each of the attributes either ap-  plies or does not apply to a specified object or a set of objects.

It is often the case, however, that attributes are graded rather  than just bivalent yes/no attributes. For instance, ?average  household income?, ?low fuel consumption?, and ?very high  price? are all examples of attributes for which it makes more  sense to consider degrees to which the attributes apply to  objects rather than just applies/does not apply. Therefore,  there is a need to develop a theory of if-then rules that  are graded counterparts of the classical association rules,  attribute implications, and functional dependencies.

In the past few decades, there have been several ap-  proaches to if-then rules in graded setting with varying  technical clarity and scientific quality. Most of the results did  not go far beyond definitions. This is partly because a lot of  the approaches have been devised long before the fuzzy logic  in narrow sense [10], [11] and the theory of fuzzy relational  Vilem Vychodil is with the Dept.

systems [1] were developed. In a series of papers, we have  introduced fuzzy attribute implications which seem to be  ?the right? counterparts of the classical attribute implications,  see [4] and [5] for a survey of results. The nontrivial  results on nonredundant bases and axiomatization [7] of the  entailment of fuzzy attribute implications support the claim  that fuzzy attribute implications are among the various if-  then rules used in data mining of fuzzy relational data the  most appropriate ones.

One of the benefits of using fuzzy attribute implications is  their great expressive power. For example, we have shown [6]  that fuzzy attribute implications can be used to describe  fixpoints of arbitrary fuzzy closure operators. In addition to  that, there is a tractable procedure to compute a nonredundant  base (certain minimal description) of such fixpoints using  fuzzy attribute implications. In this paper, we show that these  results cannot be obtained with weaker formulas. Namely,  we focus on ordinary if-then rules whose semantics and  entailment will be defined as it is usual in Pavelka?s abstract  fuzzy logic [10], [15]. Intuitively, such rules may seem  (nearly) as expressive as fuzzy attribute implications but we  show, by means of counterexamples, that they are not. We  further argue that the weaker formulas are not suitable for  basic data mining tasks in case of object-attribute data with  graded attributes.

This paper is organized as follows, Section II presents pre-  liminaries. In Section III, we recall notions of fuzzy attribute  implications, their models, entailment, and related notions. In  Section IV, we formulate the problem in a more detail and,  finally, in Section V, we present the counterexamples.



II. PRELIMINARIES  In this section we present an overview of notions of  fuzzy logic and fuzzy set theory we will be using in the  sequel. Details can be found e.g. in [1], [10], [11], a good  introduction to fuzzy logic and fuzzy sets is presented in [13].

We will use complete residuated lattices with hedges as  basic structures of truth degrees. A complete residuated  lattice with a truth-stressing hedge (shortly, a hedge) [11],  [12] is an algebra L = ?L,?,?,?,?, ?, 0, 1? such that ?L,?,?, 0, 1? is a complete lattice with 0 and 1 being the least and greatest element of L, respectively; ?L,?, 1? is a commutative monoid (i.e. ? is commutative, associative, and a ? 1 = 1 ? a = a for each a ? L); ? and ? satisfy so-called adjointness property: a ? b ? c iff a ? b ? c for each a, b, c ? L; hedge ? satisfies (i) 1? = 1, (ii) a? ? a, (iii) (a ? b)? ? a? ? b?, and (iv) a?? = a?, for each a, b ? L. Elements a of L are called truth degrees.

? and ? are (truth functions of) ?fuzzy conjunction? and ?fuzzy implication?. Hedge ? is a (truth function of) logical      connective ?very true?, see [11], [12]. Properties of hedges  have natural interpretations, e.g. (ii) can be read: ?if a is very true, then a is true?, (iii) can be read: ?if a ? b is very true and if a is very true, then b is very true?, etc.

A common choice of L is a structure with L = [0, 1] (unit interval), ? and ? being minimum and maximum, ? being a left-continuous t-norm with the corresponding ?.

Three most important pairs of adjoint operations on the unit  interval are:  ?ukasiewicz: a ? b = max(a + b ? 1, 0),  a ? b = min(1 ? a + b, 1), (1)  Go?del:  a ? b = min(a, b), a ? b =  { 1, if a ? b, b, otherwise,  (2)  Goguen (product):  a ? b = a ? b, a ? b =  { 1, if a ? b, b a , otherwise.

(3)  Two boundary cases of (truth-stressing) hedges are (i)  identity, i.e. a? = a (a ? L); (ii) globalization [16]: a? =  { 1, if a = 1, 0, otherwise.

(4)  A special case of a complete residuated lattice with hedge is  the two-element Boolean algebra ?{0, 1},?,?,?,?, ?, 0, 1?, denoted by 2, which is the structure of truth degrees of the  classical logic. That is, the operations ?,?,?,? of 2 are the truth functions (interpretations) of the corresponding logical  connectives of the classical logic and 0? = 0, 1? = 1.

Having L, we define usual notions: an L-set (fuzzy set)  A in universe U is a mapping A : U ? L, A(u) be- ing interpreted as ?the degree to which u belongs to A?.

If U = {u1, . . . , un} then A can be denoted by A = {a1/u1, . . . , an/un} meaning that A(ui) equals ai for each i = 1, . . . , n. For brevity, we introduce the following conven- tion: we write {. . . , u, . . . } instead of {. . . , 1/u, . . . }, and we also omit elements of U whose membership degree is zero.

For example, we write {u, 0.5/v} instead of {1/u, 0.5/v, 0/w} and so on. Let LU denote the collection of all L-sets in  U . The operations with L-sets are defined componentwise.

For instance, the intersection of L-sets A,B ? LU is an L- set A ? B in U such that (A ? B)(u) = A(u) ? B(u) for each u ? U , etc. Binary L-relations (binary fuzzy relations) between X and Y can be thought of as L-sets in the universe X ? Y . That is, a binary L-relation I ? LX?Y between a set X and a set Y is a mapping assigning to each x ? X and each y ? Y a truth degree I(x, y) ? L (a degree to which x and y are related by I).

Given A,B ? LU , we define a subsethood degree S(A,B) =  ? u?U  ( A(u) ? B(u)), (5)  which generalizes the classical subsethood relation ?.

S(A,B) represents a degree to which A is a subset of B.

In particular, we write A ? B iff S(A,B) = 1. As a consequence, A ? B iff A(u) ? B(u) for each u ? U .

A fuzzy set A ? LU is called crisp if, for each u ? U ,  A(u) ? {0, 1}. Hence, by a slight abuse of notation, we can identify crisp fuzzy sets in U with the ordinary subsets of U .

In the following we use well-known properties of resid-  uated lattices and fuzzy structures which can be found  in monographs [1], [10], [11], [13]. Throughout the rest of  the paper, L denotes an arbitrary complete residuated lattice  with a hedge.

A system S = {Ai ? LU | i ? I} is said to be closed under S?-intersections iff, for each B ? LU ,?  i?I(S(B,Ai) ? ? Ai) ? S. (6)  A system S ? LU closed under S?-intersections is called an L ?-closure system in U . An L?-closure operator (or, a fuzzy  closure operator with hedge ?) on a set U is a mapping C : LU ? LU satisfying, for each A,B1, B2 ? LU ,  A ? C(A), (7) S(B1, B2)  ? ? S(C(B1), C(B2)), (8) C(A) = C(C(A)). (9)  Note that if ? is globalization, the notions of an L?-closure  system and an L?-closure operator will become the usual  notions of a fuzzy closure system and a fuzzy closure  operator [1].

Theorem 1 (see [2]): Let S = {Ai ? LU | i ? I} be an L ?-closure system. Then CS : L  U ? LU defined by CS(B) =  ? i?I(S(B,Ai)  ? ? Ai) (10) is an L?-closure operator. Moreover, for each B ? LU , we have B ? S iff B = CS(B).

Let C : LU ? LU be an L?-closure operator. Then SC = {A ? LU |A = C(A)} is an L?-closure system.

In addition to Theorem 1, there is a one-to-one correspon-  dence between L?-closure operators on U and L?-closure systems on U [2]. In detail, let C be an L?-closure operator on U , S be an L?-closure system on U . Then we have C = CSC and S = SCS , i.e. the mappings C ? SC and S ? CS are mutually inverse. See [2] for more details.



III. FUZZY ATTRIBUTE IMPLICATIONS  A. Fuzzy attribute implications and their interpretation  In this section we introduce fuzzy attribute implications [4]  and define their interpretation in fuzzy sets of attributes.

Suppose Y is a finite nonempty set of attributes. A (fuzzy) attribute implication (over attributes Y ) is an expression A ? B, where A,B ? LY (A and B are fuzzy sets of attributes).

The intended meaning of A ? B is: ?if it is (very) true that an object has all attributes from A, then it has also all attributes from B? with the logical connectives being given by L. Fuzzy attribute implications are meant to be interpreted  in data tables with fuzzy attributes [4]. A data table with  fuzzy attributes can be seen is a triplet ?X,Y, I? where X is a set of objects, Y is a finite set of attributes (the same as above in the definition of a fuzzy attribute implication),  and I ? LX?Y is a binary L-relation between X and Y assigning to each object x ? X and each attribute y ? Y     a degree I(x, y) to which x has y. ?X,Y, I? can be seen as a table with rows and columns corresponding to objects  x ? X and attributes y ? Y , respectively, and table entries containing degrees I(x, y).

A row of a table ?X,Y, I? corresponding to an object x ? X can be identified with a fuzzy set Ix of attributes to which an attribute y ? Y belongs to a degree Ix(y) = I(x, y).

For fuzzy set M ? LY of attributes, we define a degree ||A ? B||M ? L to which A ? B is true in M by  ||A ? B||M = S(A,M)? ? S(B,M). (11) It is easily seen that if M is a fuzzy set of attributes of some object x, i.e. M = Ix, then ||A ? B||M is the degree to which ?if it is (very) true that x has all attributes from A then x has all attributes from B?. More generally, for a system M of L-sets in Y , define a degree ||A ? B||M to which A ? B is true in (each M from) M by  ||A ? B||M = ?  M?M ||A ? B||M . (12) Finally, given a data table ?X,Y, I? and putting M = {Ix |x ? X}, ||A ? B||M is a degree to which A ? B is true in each row of table T , i.e. a degree to which ?for each object x ? X: if it is (very) true that x has all attributes from A, then x has all attributes from B?. This degree is denoted by ||A ? B||?X,Y,I? and is called a degree to which A ? B is true in ?X,Y, I?.

B. Models, semantic entailment, and bases  We now focus on models of sets of fuzzy attribute impli-  cations and related notions as models will play a key role in  our considerations on the expressive power of FAIs. Let T be a set of fuzzy attribute implications. M ? LY is called a model of T if ||A ? B||M = 1 for each A ? B ? T . The set of all models of T is denoted by Mod(T ), i.e.

Mod(T ) = {M ? LY | for all A ? B ? T : ||A ? B||M = 1}. (13)  Using results from [2], the set Mod(T ) of all models of a set T of FAIs over Y is an L?-closure system on Y . The associated closure operator CMod(T ) sends each M ? LY to the least model of T containing M . Using (12) with M being Mod(T ), we define a degree ||A ? B||T to which A ? B semantically follows from T by  ||A ? B||T = ||A ? B||Mod(T ), (14) i.e. the semantic entailment from T is defined as a degree to which a given FAIs is true in each model of T .

Let ?X,Y, I? be a data table with fuzzy attributes. A set T of fuzzy attribute implications is called a base of ?X,Y, I? if ||A ? B||T = ||A ? B||?X,Y,I?. Thus, T is a base of ?X,Y, I? iff, for each A ? B, the degree to which T entails A ? B coincides with the degree to which A ? B is true in ?X,Y, I?. If T is a base of ?X,Y, I? and no proper subset of T is a base of ?X,Y, I?, then T is called a non-redundant base of ?X,Y, I?. Our previous results [4] have shown a characterization of (nonredundant) bases of data tables with  fuzzy attributes: each table has at least one base and in many  important cases, we are able to describe a nonredundant base  which is also a minimal one (in terms of the number of FAIs  contained).

C. Fuzzy concept lattices with hedge  Fuzzy concept lattices are particular structures of con-  ceptual clusters which are induced by object-attribute data  table with fuzzy attributes. In the sequel, we will use such  structures to find counterexamples.

Given a data table with fuzzy attributes ?X,Y, I?, for A ? L  X , B ? LY (i.e. A is a fuzzy set of objects, B is a fuzzy set of attributes), we define fuzzy sets A? ? LY (fuzzy set of attributes), B? ? LX (fuzzy set of objects) by  A?(y) = ?  x?X  ( A(x)? ? I(x, y)), (15)  B?(x) = ?  y?Y  ( B(y) ? I(x, y)). (16)  Operators ?, ? form so-called Galois connection with hedge [2], [8]. Pairs ?A,B?, where A ? LX , B ? LY , A? = B, and B? = A are naturally interpreted as concepts (clusters) hidden in the input data represented by I . Namely, A? = B and B? = A say that B (so called intent) is the collection of all attributes shared by all objects from A, and A (so called extent) is the collection of all objects sharing all attributes from B. The structure of all concepts equipped with the subconcept-superconcept hierarchy is called a fuzzy  concept lattice induced by ?X,Y, I?.

The following assertions show model-theoretical charac-  terizations of bases of data tables with fuzzy attributes.

Theorem 2 (see [2]): Let ?X,Y, I? be a data table with fuzzy attributes. Then  Int(X,Y, I) = {B ? LY |B = B??} (17) is an L?-closure system such that ?? : LY ? LY is the corresponding L?-closure operator. As a consequence, we  get Int(X,Y, I) = {B?? |B ? LY }.

Theorem 3 (see [4]): Let ?X,Y, I? be a data table with  fuzzy attributes. Then a set T of fuzzy attribute implications is a base of ?X,Y, I? iff Mod(T ) = Int(X,Y, I).



IV. EXPRESSIVE POWER OF FAIS  Using FAIs, we can express if-then dependencies among  graded attributes, e.g., FAI {1/u, 0.6/v}? {0.8/w} says that if an object has u (to degree 1) and v to degree 0.6, then it has w to degree 0.8. The degrees 1, 0.6, and 0.8 in the FAI can be seen as threshold truth degrees. Intuitively, FAIs  with threshold degrees have greater ?expressive power? than  ordinary if-then dependency formulas of the form A ? B, where A and B are ordinary subsets of Y . In this paper we prove this claim and more.

Obviously, the notion of ?expressive power? needs to be  clarified. We will take the model-theoretical approach. For  each family of formulas F, we can consider all systems  of models which may be delimited by all possible theories  (collections of formulas) from F. Denote this collection of  all possible systems of models by Mod(F). Hence, for each theory T consisting of formulas from F, Mod(F) contains the system of all models of T . Clearly, if F1 and F2 are two     families of formulas, F1 has greater expressive power than  F2 if Mod(F2) ? Mod(F1). In other words, F1 has greater expressive power than F2 if each model system which can  be delimited by formulas from F2 can also be delimited by  formulas from F1, i.e. the collection of all systems of models  that can be described by F1 is greater.

Let us take a look at the expressive power of FAIs and  related formulas. Due to observations from [2], [6], L?-  closure systems are exactly the systems of models of FAIs.

In a more detail, for each set T of FAIs over Y , Mod(T ) is an L?-closure system [2] in Y and, conversely, for each L ?-closure system S in Y , there is a set T of FAIs such that  S = Mod(T ). Namely, we can take T = {A ? CS(A) |A ? LY },  where CS is the L ?-closure operator induced by S, see [6].

Thus, if F denotes the family of all FAIs over Y , then  Mod(F) = {Mod(T ) |T ? F} (18) is the collection of all L?-closure systems in Y . Thus, (18) gives us a clear description of the expressive power of FAIs.

We will now compare the expressive power of FAIs  with other types of formulas. Namely, we focus on if-then  formulas which do not have threshold truth degrees. Such  formulas take form of implications between two groups of  (symbols of) attributes connected by conjunctions:  (y1 & ? ? ?& ym) ? (y?1 & ? ? ?& y?n), (19) with the usual truth-functional interpretation. For simplicity,  observe that formulas (19) can be seen as FAIs which allow  for threshold truth degrees 0 and 1, only. Indeed, fuzzy attribute implication A ? B (over Y ) will be called crisp if both A and B are crisp fuzzy sets. We can see that (19) can be seen as a FAI  {y1, . . . , ym} ? {y?1, . . . , y?n}, (20) and the interpretation of (19) coincides with the interpre-  tation of the corresponding FAI (with & interpreted as the min-conjunction). Thus, the ordinary if-then rules (classical  attribute implications [9]) with their usual interpretation can  be seen as particular FAIs.

We now show that crisp FAIs have strictly smaller ex-  pressive power than the general FAIs. That is, we are going  to show that there are L?-closure systems which cannot be  described by crisp FAIs. We prove even more, because we  focus on Pavelka-style entailment [15] from crisp FAIs and  related model classes. Even in this more general setting, crisp  FAIs are not as expressive as general FAIs.

Recall that the abstract fuzzy logic (also known as Pavelka-  style fuzzy logic) considers entailment from fuzzy sets of  formulas. In our setting, we are interested in fuzzy sets of  crisp FAIs. Let T be a fuzzy set of crisp FAIs. Then, M ? LY is called a model of T if, for each crisp A ? B,  T (A ? B) ? ||A ? B||M . (21) Let Mod(T ) denote the set of all models of a fuzzy set T of crisp FAIs. The degree ||A ? B||T to which A ? B semantically follows from a fuzzy set T of crisp FAIs is  defined by ||A ? B||T = ||A ? B||Mod(T ).

For technical reasons, we now show that semantic entail-  ment from fuzzy sets of crisp FAIs is reducible to semantic  entailment from ordinary sets of certain general FAIs. Here  we use a procedure which is a particularization of a more  general procedure which we have introduced in [4]. Let T be a fuzzy set of crisp FAIs. For each crisp FAI of the from (20)  and a truth degree b ? L, we can consider a FAI defined by {y1, . . . , ym} ? {b/y?1, . . . , b/y?n}, (22)  i.e. the antecedent of the FAI remains the same and the  consequent contains threshold degrees b instead of the origi- nal threshold degrees 1. Denote the resulting fuzzy attribute implication by c(A ? B, b), where A ? B abbreviates (20).

Now, given a fuzzy set T of crisp FAIs, we can construct a set c(T ) of FAIs as follows  c(T ) = {c(A ? B, b) |T (A ? B) = b > 0}.

One can check [4] that  Mod(T ) = Mod(c(T )).

In other words, fuzzy sets of crisp FAIs have the same  expressive power as ordinary sets composed of FAIs of the  form c(A ? B, b). Thus, in order to show that the expressive power of general FAIs is strictly greater than the expressive  power of crisp FAIs with Pavelka-style entailment it suffices  to find an L?-closure system which is not a system of models  of any set of FAIs of the form c(A ? B, b).

In the next section we show particular L?-closure systems  which serve as counterexamples. We will induce these L?-  closure systems by data tables with fuzzy attributes. This  will show that the L?-closure systems, which cannot be  delimited by these ?weaker formulas?, naturally appear in the  analysis of object-attribute data with graded attributes. As a  consequence, the weaker formulas cannot be used to describe  systems of intents of formal concepts, i.e. the formulas are  not sufficient for particular data mining tasks studied earlier  related to data with graded attributes, see [4] for a survey.



V. ANALYSIS AND THE COUNTEREXAMPLES  In this section, we present counterexamples to the claim  that fuzzy sets of crisp fuzzy attribute implications have the  same expressive power as sets of (general) fuzzy attribute  implications. We will present minimal examples which the  least truth degrees possible. We focus on founding counterex-  amples which use identity and globalization on ?ukasiewicz  and Go?del chains because these structures of truth degrees  are perhaps the most widely used structures of truth degrees  in fuzzy logic.

We will see that it is sufficient to take just three truth  degrees: 0 (falsity), 0.5 (mid falsity/truth), and 1 (full truth).

Thus, we put L = {0, 0.5, 1} with the natural ordering 0 < 0.5 < 1. In addition to that, we will consider operations on L given by (1) and (2), and two hedges: identity and globalization (4). For each of these four residuated lattices  with hedges, we show a counterexample. That is, considering  each of the structures of truth degrees, we are going to show  a particular L?-closure system which cannot be delimited     as a system of models of any fuzzy set of crisp FAIs. All  the L?-closure systems used as counterexamples will be  induced by data tables with graded attributes because we  want to show that the counterexamples quite naturally appear  in data analysis, i.e., that they are not just some artificially  constructed structures.

A. Counterexample for globalization and/or Go?del chain  We begin with the simpler case. Consider the following  data table with fuzzy attributes:  y  x 0  That is, we have X = {x}, Y = {y}, and I(x, y) = 0. If ? the hedge ? is globalization (and ? arbitrary), or ? the hedge ? is identity and ? is the Go?del multiplication,  then in both cases we get Int(X,Y, I) = {{}, {y}}. Due to Theorem 2, Int(X,Y, I) is an L?-closure system. We now claim that this particular closure system cannot be described  by a fuzzy set of crisp fuzzy attribute implications. That is,  we prove that there is no fuzzy set T of crisp FAIs such that Mod(T ) = Int(X,Y, I) = {{}, {y}}.

Since we have a single attribute Y = {y}, we have four pairwise different crisp FAIs:  {}?{}, {}?{y}, {y}?{}, {y}?{y}.

Clearly, {} ? {}, {y} ? {}, and {y} ? {y} are true in each M ? LY to degree 1, i.e. such FAIs cannot be used to ?disqualify? any model. In a more detail, if we have two  fuzzy sets T and T ? of crisp FAIs such that  (i) for each M ? LY: ||A ? B||M = 1, and (ii) for each C ? D different from A ? B:  T (C ? D) = T ?(C ? D), then Mod(T ) = Mod(T ?). From this point of view, the degrees to which {}?{}, {y}?{}, and {y}?{y} belong to a theory are not important because these formulas do not  have an influence on the set of models of such theory.

Hence, the only nontrivial crisp fuzzy attribute implication  is {}?{y}. Since we are interested in theories which consist of fuzzy sets of FAIs, we have just two nontrivial theories:  T1({}?{y}) = 0.5, T2({}?{y}) = 1.

Again, we do not consider T ({}?{y}) = 0 because each fuzzy set of attributes is a model of such T . The latter fuzzy sets T1 and T2 of crisp fuzzy attribute implications correspond with the following ordinary sets of (general)  fuzzy attribute implications:  c(T1) = {{}?{0.5/y}}, c(T2) = {{}?{y}}.

From previous observations,  Mod(c(T1)) = Mod(T1),  Mod(c(T2)) = Mod(T2).

Clearly, if ? is globalization (4) or ? is the Go?del multipli- cation (2), we have  Mod(c(T1)) = {{0.5/y}, {y}}, (23) Mod(c(T2)) = {{y}}. (24)  Therefore, the L?-closure system Int(X,Y, I) = {{}, {y}} induced by a data table with I(x, y) = 0 cannot be described by a fuzzy set of crisp fuzzy attribute implications because  the only L?-closure systems which can be described by  fuzzy set of crisp FAIs are (23) and (24), respectively. That  concludes our first counterexample.

B. Counterexample for a ?ukasiewicz chain with identity  The previous counterexample did not include the situation  where ? is identity and ? is the ?ukasiewicz multiplication, see (1). In this case, we can also find an L?-closure system  which is not a model class of any fuzzy set of crisp FAIs. In  this case, however, we cannot induce the L?-closure system  by a data table with just one attribute. Indeed, if we take  y  x 0 ,  we get Int(X,Y, I) = {{}, {0.5/y}, {y}}. Hence, if we take T = ?, i.e., for each A ? B, T (A ? B) = 0, we have Int(X,Y, I) = {{}, {0.5/y}, {y}} = Mod(T ). In other words, such an L?-closure system equals to LY , which is a  system that can trivially be described by the empty theory.

If we take  y  x 0.5 ,  we obtain Int(X,Y, I) = {{0.5/y}, {y}}. In this case, we can take a fuzzy set T of crisp FAIs such that T ({}?{y}) = 0.5.

One can check that for such T , Int(X,Y, I) = Mod(T ).

Finally, for  y  x 1 ,  we have Int(X,Y, I) = {{y}}, which can be described by a fuzzy set T of crisp FAIs such that T ({}?{y}) = 1.

Therefore, we must consider Int(X,Y, I) induced by a larger data table. We will see that it is sufficient to keep the  only object x and two attributes y and z. That is, we consider X = {x}, Y = {y, z}, and I given by the following table:  y z  x 0 0.5  One can check that we have  Int(X,Y, I) = {{0.5/z}, {0.5/y, z}, {y, z}}. (25) Again, we will show that there is no fuzzy set of crisp fuzzy  attribute implications over Y = {y, z} such that its models are exactly the fuzzy sets of attributes from Int(X,Y, I). In this case, we have (22)2 = 16 pairwise different crisp FAIs     over Y , namely:  {}?{}, {}?{y}, {}?{z}, {}?{y, z}, {y}?{}, {y}?{y}, {y}?{z}, {y}?{y, z}, {z}?{}, {z}?{y}, {z}?{z}, {z}?{y, z},  {y, z}?{}, {y, z}?{y}, {y, z}?{z}, {y, z}?{y, z}.

Only a few of the above-listed FAIs can be used to disqualify  models. First, we can omit all FAIs A ? B such that B ? A because such FAIs are true in each fuzzy sets of attributes to  degree 1. Hence, following the arguments from the previous counterexample, their appearance in fuzzy sets of crisp FAIs  in not interesting from the model-theoretical point of view.

Therefore, our set of crisp FAIs reduces to:  {}?{y}, {}?{z}, {}?{y, z}, {y}?{z}, {y}?{y, z}, {z}?{y}, {z}?{y, z}.

Furthermore, we can skip all crisp fuzzy attribute implica-  tions A ? B such that B ? A ?= ?. Indeed, this is due to the fact that for each FAI A?B over Y and B? ? LY such that  B?(y) =  { 0, if B(y) ? A(y), B(y), otherwise,  we have ||A ? B||M = ||A ? B?||M for each M ? LY .

Hence, the original set of 16 crisp fuzzy attribute implications reduces to  {}?{y}, {}?{z}, {}?{y, z}, {y}?{z}, {z}?{y}.

Suppose now, by contradiction, that Int(X,Y, I) given by (25) can be described by a fuzzy set of the previous five crisp  FAIs. That is, we assume that there is a fuzzy set T of crisp FAIs, containing at most the previous five FAIs to a nonzero  degree, such that Mod(T ) = Int(X,Y, I). Let us analyze how T would look like. Since Mod(T ) ?= LY , T must be nonempty, i.e. there must be a crisp FAI A ? B such that T (A?B) ?= 0. Observe that for {0.5/z} ? Int(X,Y, I),  ||{}?{y}||{0.5/z} = 1 ? 1 ? 0 ? 1 = 1 ? 0 = 0, ||{}?{z}||{0.5/z} = 1 ? 1 ? 1 ? 0.5 = 1 ? 0.5 = 0.5,  ||{}?{y, z}||{0.5/z} = 1 ? 1 ? 0 ? 0.5 = 1 ? 0 = 0, ||{y}?{z}||{0.5/z} = 0 ? 1 ? 1 ? 0.5 = 0 ? 0.5 = 1, ||{z}?{y}||{0.5/z} = 1 ? 0.5 ? 0 ? 1 = 0.5 ? 0 = 0.5.

Since we assume that {0.5/z} ? Mod(T ), the truth degrees ||? ? ?||{0.5/z} computed above yield that T must be a union of some of the following theories:  T1({}?{z}) = 0.5, T1(? ? ? ) = 0 otherwise, T2({y}?{z}) = 0.5, T2(? ? ? ) = 0 otherwise, T3({y}?{z}) = 1, T3(? ? ? ) = 0 otherwise, T4({z}?{y}) = 0.5, T4(? ? ? ) = 0 otherwise.

That is, T = Ti1?? ? ??Tik , where {i1, . . . , ik} ? {1, . . . , 4}.

T must be a union of at least one of T1, . . . , T4 because Mod(T ) ?= LY . Now, put M = {0.5/y, 0.5/z} and observe:  ||{}?{z}||M = 1 ? 1 ? 1 ? 0.5 = 1 ? 0.5 = 0.5,  ||{y}?{z}||M = 0.5 ? 1 ? 1 ? 0.5 = 0.5 ? 0.5 = 1, ||{z}?{y}||M = 1 ? 0.5 ? 0.5 ? 1 = 0.5 ? 0.5 = 1.

That is, M = {0.5/y, 0.5/z} is a model of each T1, . . . , T4.

Therefore, M is also a model of any union of T1, . . . , T4. As a consequence, M must be a model of T and, consequently, it must belong to Int(X,Y, I) because we have assumed Mod(T ) = Int(X,Y, I)?a contradiction to the fact that M ?? Int(X,Y, I).

Remark: Let us stress that general FAIs can be used  as an alternative means for describing concept lattices. Each  concept lattice has its nonredundant base T , consisting of FAIs, such that the models of T are exactly the intents of conceptual clusters [4]. By the counterexamples presented in  this section we have demonstrated that weaker formulas are  not powerful enough to do this job.

Conclusions: We have shown that sets of fuzzy at-  tribute implications have strictly greater expressive power  than fuzzy sets of the ordinary attribute implications by  providing several closure structures that can be described by  sets of fuzzy attribute implications but cannot be described by  fuzzy sets of ordinary attribute implications. This has several  practical consequences for mining nonredundant bases of  object-attribute data tables with fuzzy attributes. Our future  research will focus on the expressive power of formulas with  semantics related to FAIs, e.g., fuzzy Horn clauses, see [3].
