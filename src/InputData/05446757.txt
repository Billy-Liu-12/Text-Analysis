Abstract?Electronics onboard rovers and spacecrafts are kept at approximately 20 ?C by using radioisotope heater units (RHU), mechanically pumped fluid loops (MPFL), and centralized warm boxes.   1 2 These thermal control mechanisms add weight and volume of payload, adding to limitations on the number of science instruments that can be accommodated in a space mission. The University of Arkansas together with partnering universities and industry have designed various radiation-hardened silicon germanium (SiGe) based electronics modules and systems that can be used to build spacecraft instruments,  robotics components, life support electronics components, and other application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) for space.

These low temperature electronics that can withstand space radiation and thermal cycling would reduce cost, weight, and increase the number of instruments on the payload, hence more science data. In this paper, we evaluate mission optimization, reliability, benefits/cost, and tradeoffs of using SiGe based electronics and systems for cryogenic planetary surface exploration.  Also, we analyze components that can be built using SiGe based electronics and show a quantitative impact to a manned planetary surface exploration mission.
