PRIVACY PRESERVATION IN HORIZONTALLY PARTITIONED DATABASES

Abstract? Association rule mining finds the strong association  between the large items of data sets. In this paper we mainly  focus on the privacy using Ck secure sum in randomized  response technique. Because when the data is distributed  among different sites in horizontal partitioning across multiple  sites and the sites wish to collaborate to identify valid  association rule globally. However the sites must not  acknowledge individual data. We presents the multi party  transaction data who discover frequent item sets with  minimum support, without either sites knowing the individual  data.

Keywords- Horizontal Partitioning, Association Rule Mining,  Secure Multi Party Computation, Randomized Response  Technique, Modified Ck Secure Sum.



I.  INTRODUCTION  Privacy has become an alarming issue when distributed  database came into picture. Now a day organizations follow  distributed database as it hysterics to its requirement. For  this reason, several efforts have been devoted to integrate  privacy preserving techniques [6] with data mining  algorithms [1] [2] [3] in order to prevent the disclosure of  sensitive information during the knowledge discovery. The  existing privacy preserving data mining techniques can be  classified according to the following five different  dimensions, those are, data distribution that is done in two  ways centralized database and distributed database. The  modification enforced to the data using encryption,  perturbation and generalization techniques. The data mining  algorithm in which the privacy preservation technique is  designed, the data type that may be single data items or  complex data correlations, needs to be protected from  disclosure. The approach may be Randomized response  techniques, adopted for preserving privacy [10] [11].

Heuristic based techniques are limited to centralized  datasets and Randomized response techniques are mainly  designed for protecting privacy in a distributed database by  using encryption techniques. Mostly, privacy preserving  algorithm exists that outperforms all the others on all  possible criteria. Rather, an algorithm may perform better  than another one on specific criteria like privacy level, data  quality. Therefore, it is important to provide users with a                         Fig.1. Partitioning of Database  comprehensive set of privacy preserving [12] [13] Modified  Ck Secure Sum.  The main goal of privacy preserving data  mining is privacy preserving data mining algorithm should  not only prevent the discovery of sensible information but  also should be resistant to the various data mining  techniques. It should not compromise the access and the use  of non sensitive data and it should not have an exponential  computational complexity.

Horizontal Partitioning: - Horizontal Partition divides the table into multiple tables that contains smaller number rows  [3] [9] [10] [11], refers to these cases where dissimilar  database records reside in dissimilar places.  Figure 2 shows  the partition of table in horizontal partition.

Vertical Partitioning: -Vertical Partition divides the table  into multiple tables that contains smaller number columns.

Mainly two type of vertical partition prepared first is  normalization in which redundant attributes are removed  from the table and another one is row splitting in which the  original table divides into table which contain fewer  columns [10] [11]. Figure 2 shows the partition of table in  horizontal partition.

Hybrid Partitioning: - Hybrid Partition [10] [11] data is partition is first horizontal and then vertical partition or  vertical partition and then horizontal partition.

Distributed Data Mining: - Distributed computing play an  important role in the data mining process for several  reasons. First, data mining often requires huge amounts of  resources in storage space and computation time. So to  make systems scalable, it is important to develop  mechanisms that distribute the work load among several  sites in a flexible way. Second, data is often inherently  Database Partitioning  Horizontal Partitioning     Vertical Partitioning  Hybrid Partitioning  Proceedings of 2013 IEEE Conference on Information and Communication Technologies (ICT 2013)         Fig.2. Partitioning of Database (Tabular Form)  distributed into several databases, making a centralized  processing of this data very inefficient and prone to security  risks. Distributed Data Mining explores techniques of how  to apply data mining in a non-centralized way.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2  describes the various works that related to association rule  mining, distributed association rule mining and secure  multiparty computation. Section 3 describes about the  Modified Ck Secure sum Technique in horizontal  partitioned database. Section 4 gave an experimental  implementation and analysis of proposed method.



II. PRILIMNARY CONCEPT    Association Rule Mining  Let I = {i1, i2? in} be a set of items and T = {T1, T2?  Tn} be a set of transactions where each T I i . A transaction  Ti contains an item set X I only if i X T. An association  rule [3] [6] implication is of the form X Y(X Y 0) with  support s and confidence C if S% of the transactions in T  contains X Y  and C% of transactions that contain X also  contain Y. In a horizontally partitioned database, the  transactions are distributed among n sites.

Sup (X Y) = P(X Y) /|Total Number of Transaction|  The global support count of an item set is the sum of all  local support counts.

Sup g (X) =  =  n  i  i xSup  )( .

Confidence of rule (X Y) = Sup (X Y) / Sup(X)  The global confidence of a rule can be expressed in terms of  the global support.

Confidence g (X Y) = Sup g (X Y) / Sup g(X)  The aim of the privacy preserving association rule mining is  to find all rules with global support and global confidence  higher than the user specified minimum support and  confidence. The following steps, utilizing the secure sum  and secure set union methods described earlier are used. The  basis of the algorithm is the Apriori algorithm which use the  (k-1) sized frequent item sets to generate the k sized  frequent item sets. The problem of generating size 1 item  sets can be easily done with secure computation on the  multiple sites.

Privacy concept again applies for different partition  algorithm using different concepts shown in Fig3.

Without trusted party each party will calculate their own  partial support and add their own random number and sends  the result to the next party  in the ring so that the other party  will never know the result of others and in last the initiator  party will disclose the result that is global support. Fig4  represent the model of without trusted party.

In trusted party each party will calculate their partial support  and send to the trusted party and add the own random  number and send to the next coming site in the ring so that  other party will never know the result of other parties after  that trusted party will disclose the result and send to all sites  that presents in the ring. Fig5 represent the model of with  trusted party.

Fig 3: Represents the Privacy Preserving Models       Fig4: Without Trusted Party Model     Privacy Preserving Technique  Semi Honest Party    Without Trusted Party With Trusted Party  Proceedings of 2013 IEEE Conference on Information and Communication Technologies (ICT 2013)          Fig 5: with trusted party model  In semi honest party all party will follows the set of rule and  they are allowed to memorize everything they run while  executing the protocol and to use this information about the  other party.

Multi Party Computation  The problem of two party?s computation arises when more  than two parties want to share their data and want to find  their global result without disclosing their own data, is  referred to secure multi party computation (SMC) [6].

Goldwasser defined the SMC problem that deals with any  type of input or function in distributed database.

There are many solution and problem that will solve using  the secure sum multi party computation. But in the most of  the cases one party is considered as trusted party. That party  will compute the result and distribute the result to all the  party that present in the distributed environment.

Secure sum technique basically divide the whole database  into number of different parties and each party have their  particular sequence number (P1, P2,????Pn) so that if P1  want to the value of data of P2 and P4 then party P1 will  never able to know the data of other parties so in Modified  Ck secure sum very useful to provide a security to database  with data leakage is zero percent. Basically SMC problem  uses two computation models, ideal model and real model,  in ideal model there exist a trusted third party which will  compute the result and broadcast the result to all other sites  present in database. But in real model the parties agree on  some techniques which allows all the parties to evaluate the  function and find the global result. But in Modified Ck  Secure sum Technique here we change the position of every  site every time after computation of the first. If there are  four parties then number of round is four (if there are n  number of parties then numbers of round is n) but the global  result will always be same in all round so that we will be  able to provide high security to database and percentage of  data leakage is zero.

Mainly secure multi party computation has two goals; one is  to provide the security to the individual data and another is  correctness of the result. Secure multi party computation  contains two main models one is Real model and Ideal  model. Real model uses without trusted party and Ideal  model uses for with trusted party (TTP) [12] [13].

According to the number of inputs, the computation is  classified into two models, single input computation model  and another is multi input computation. The transformation  from input to secure multi party computation contains three  ways transformation. First one is convert multi party input  to secure multi party computation after the computation.

Second one is convert multi party computation to  homogeneous secure multi party computation. Third one is  convert multi party computation to heterogeneous secure  multi party computation.

Randomized Response Techniques In the randomized response technique, consider the data sets  I = {I1, I2, I3??In} and the random number or noise part  are denoted by R= {R1, R2, R3 ?Rn}, the new set of  records are denoted by I1+R1, I2+R2 ?.In+Rn and after that  take a partial support Pij = {Pi1, Pi2???..Pin} so that  partial support is  P ij=I+R  I=Pij-R  Randomization technique basically contains two steps two  convert the data set into the original data sets. The first step  is randomize the data and transmit their data into the data  receiver. And second step the data receiver estimates their  original data by applying the distribution reconstruction  algorithm. The model of randomization is shown in below  figure 6.



III. PROPOSED WORK  Assumption for the proposed work are taken as the database  is horizontally partitioned and distributed among sites and  the total number of sites is greater than or equal to four (n  4). The sites are considered as trusted site and all the site  contain their own private data and no other site will be able  to know other site data .In this method, basically,  Randomized response secure sum technique [7] has been  used. In secure sum each site will determine their own data  value and send to predecessor site that near to original site  and this goes on till the original site collects all the value of  data after that the parent site will determine the global  support and global confidence [6] [10] and it also not  necessary that the result found is globally frequent or  infrequent depending on value which will create after  collecting all the value.

We have considered four sites P1, P2, P3, P4 where the sites  are interchanging its position with another by following the  algorithm. The secure sum Technique [9] is based on  changing neighbors in each round of segment computation.

Proceedings of 2013 IEEE Conference on Information and Communication Technologies (ICT 2013)       Fig.6. Shows the Model of Randomization        Fig.7. Movement of Data in between Sites The number of the site P1 is selected as the Technique  initiator site which starts the computation by distributing the  first data segment. The site traverses towards site Pn in each  round of the computation. The number of parties for this  technique must be four or more. When all the rounds of  segments summation are completed the sum is announced  by the Technique initiator site. The steps are as follows that  shown in Fig 8, 9, 10 and 11.

Algorithm  This algorithm applicable when the number of sites greater  than or equal to 4 (n 4) and the initial sites changes their  position at every round. And the number of round is equal to  number of sites.

Step1:-Consider parties P1, P2, P3????Pn. (n 4)  Step2:-Each party will generate their own random number  R1, R2???.RN  Step3:-Connect the parties in the ring (P1, P2,  P3???PN) and let P1 is a protocol initiator.

Step4:-Let RC=N, and Pij=0 (RC is round counter and Pij is  partial support)  Step5:-Partial support P1 site calculating by using following  formula  Psij = Xij.support ? Min support * |DB| + RN1 - RNn  Step6:-Site P2 computes the PSj for each item received the  list using the formula  PSij= PSij + Xij. Support ? minimum support * |DB| +Rn1-  Rn (i-1)  Step7:-While RC! =0begin for j=1 to N do  begin for I=1 to N do  begin each site will calculate their partial  support Pij send to the next site that is  neighbor to the current site.

Step8:-P1 exchange its position to P (j+1) mod N    end  RC=RC-1  end  Step9:-Party P1 allowance the result Pij  Step10:-End   Randomized responses techniques are used to find Random  number to improve the privacy making the partial support in  more randomized form. When sites try to find the global  frequent item sets from its local frequent item sets then the  sites also includes some of the infrequent item sets to its  local frequents items and send to the subsequent sites so that  the subsequent site will never know the frequent item sets of  the previous sites so it?s make the coming sites confusion.

So it provides high security to the database.



IV. RESULT AND EXPERIMENTATION  The proposed model is illustrated by using four horizontally  partitioned distributed databases. For finding privacy  preserving association rule mining using Modified Ck  Secure sum Technique. In this Sample model, the  horizontally partitioned databases [10] [11] called fragments  such as DB1, DB2, DB3 and DB4 are placed in sites P1, P2, P3  and P4 respectively. In this model that every time site P1 will  change their position to the other sites presents in this  environment. The figure below shows the flow of data  between the sites. The database table which is partitioned  horizontally is given in table 1,2,3,4.

V. CONCLUSION  The main aim of this paper is to computing global support  within a scenario of homogeneous database and provides the  high security to the database as well as hacking of data is  zero. We have considered that all sites have the same  representation, but each site does not have information on  different sites. The main goal is to produce association rules  that hold its input globally while limiting the information  shared about each site. Many proposals have been sited to  implement SMC. SMC being used in large scale databases  which extends to preserve privacy to the private data of  different sites. In this paper our focus is based on horizontal  partitioned distributed data through a popular association  rule mining technique for security used Randomized  Response Technique.
