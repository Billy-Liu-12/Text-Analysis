Application of Pattern Recognition to   the Acoustic Emission Signals of Carbon Steel

Abstract?Hydrogen Induced Cracking (HIC) is one of failure types of in-service pressure vessels. Acoustic emission (AE) is a good method to monitor HIC. In order to investigate the characteristic of AE signals produced by HIC of carbon steel used in pressure vessel, the hydrogen charging progress of 20R steel was monitored using AE technique. There were three useful AE sources during the test, corrosion and charging, FeS film forming and breaking, and HIC growth, which all can be detected through AE instrument. The amount of big amplitude AE signals were increased obviously with cracking growth and microscopic examinations provided good confirmation. The peak frequency ranges of these three kinds of AE waveform signals were similar, but their distribution of the spectrum magnitude to the corresponding frequency were different and can be used as the discriminating acoustic parameters.Therefore, a pattern recognition method based on frequency feature extraction, fisher ratio and trained back-propagation (BP) network was developed for the sources? signals class decision. Finally some testing data study was given to show the high efficiency the proposed method.

These results provide a useful way of monitoring HIC development in pressure vessels for practical inspection.

I.  INTRODUCTION Acoustic emission (AE) technique is an effective method  for monitoring dynamic damage progress, which has been applied to pressure vessel test more than 40 years since Dunegan carried out the first AE test for pressure vessel in 1963[1]. Although it is widely used to pressure vessel test in many countries [2-5], it isn?t known whether AE is effective to monitor hydrogen induced cracking (HIC) of pressure vessel made by carbon steel. Very few papers were found studied the acoustic emission of HIC of carbon steel through literature searches. O.E.Andreikiv applied AE to monitor the extending process of 9KhF and 4340 steel specimen exposed to 0.1MPa hydrogen gas [6]. It was found that AE count rate directly proportioned to growth rate of crack. S. Y. Tsai and H.C.Shih studied AE signals of JIS-G-3115 SPV-50Q steel during filtering hydrogen in wet H2S[7]. It was presumed that the signals resulted from forming and breaking of FeS cladding or HIC. In order to search AE testing method for HIC in pressure  vessel, this paper investigated AE characteristics of HIC of 20R carbon steel frequently used by pressure vessel in China.



II. TEST METHOD  A. Specimen Due to 20R steel is popularly used for pressure vessel in  China, it was selected for testing. Fig. 1 showed the shape of the specimen. The thickness of specimen was 12mm. After mechanically polished, the specimen was protected by epoxy resin. An area with diameter 2mm were polished with emery paper number 800 for charging hydrogen atom. Table I listed the chemical composition and mechanical properties.

B. Experimental Device Fig.1 showed the experimental device. H2S gas was  keeping filled into distilled water in an aquarium during the test. The specimen was as the cathode and platinum electrode as the anode. The specimen can be charged hydrogen atom by electrolysis with constant current supply. The specimen was monitored by an AE instrument during the electrolysis. The AE instrument was model AMSY-5 made by Vallen. A broad brand AE sensor with response frequencies 100kHz?900kHz was used. The gain of pre-amplifier was 40dB. The sample rate of AE waveform signals was 5 MHz, and sample point was 8192.

III. AE MONITORING RESULT Before electrifying to the specimen, the background noise  was collected. The amplitudes of background noise signals were lower than 35dB. The frequency scope of background noise signal was very wide in Fig. 2.

After electrifying, AE signals of amplitudes between 35dB and 45dB were immediately detected. These kinds of AE signals were called class A. Four hours later, AE signals of amplitudes between 45dB and 65dB emerged as shown in Fig.

3. These kinds of AE signals were called class B. After persisting 15 minutes, class B AE signals stopped. About 3 hours later, model B AE signals appeared again.

Class A and B mixed after testing 20 hours. About continuously monitoring 3 days later, bigger amplitudes of AE signals between 60dB and 75dB emerged. These kinds of AE signals were called Class C. After persisting 10 minutes, Class C AE signals stopped. About 1.5 hours later, it appeared again as shown in Fig. 4.

Fig. 5?Fig. 7 were the wave and frequency distribution figures of three classes signals. The peak frequency of three kinds of AE signals were all located in 80?180kHz. Their peak frequencies were obviously different from that of background noise. At the same time, their amplitudes of frequency below 50kHz and above 700kHz were close to zero.

But the amplitudes of different class signals were not alike.

IV. ANALYSIS OF TESTING RESULT AE signals of Class A were immediately produced when  started electrifying. It illuminated that the signals were directly produced by the corrosion of H2S solution and the process electrifying to charge hydrogen atom. It existed throughout the testing process. According to two specimens, it was found that class B signals always emerged after electrifying several hours.

Observing the corrosive surface of specimen by electron microscope, it was found that there was a layer of FeS with many cracks on the surface as in Fig. 8. Due to HIC was not found inside of the specimen by electron microscope, this illuminated that class B signals were produced by cracking and flaking off of FeS layer.

After class C signals emerged, the experiment was terminated for another specimen. It was found that there were many blisters with diameter of 0.2mm~4.5mm on the corrosive surface as in Fig. 9. Some blisters had burst and the metallograph of the specimen was observed as shown in Fig.

V. PATTERN RECOGNITION OF TESTING RESULT As it is discussed in section ? and ?, four AE sources  occurred in the test, which were class A (corrosion and charging), class B (cracking and flaking off of FeS layer), class C (hydrogen blister development) and class D (background noise). In order to associate similar types of waveforms into individual classes, pattern recognition method was used.

Firstly, it found the features of highest discrimination quality with separate waveforms of four sources signals. Then, the features were used to efficient separate signals into classes.

A. Feature Extraction Some representative waveforms for each class were chosen  as examples to get information out of individual AE signals.

For each amplitude-time series with 8192 sample points, 10 MHz sample rate, thirteen Hamming windows function were applied and the FFT calculated. The Hamming windows each with 1024 sample points, and an interesting frequency range of 50 - 700 kHz, suppressed the information close to its start and end. To avoid this suppression of information the time windows overlapped. This was shown in Fig. 11. Then, the following was obtained: The 1024 sample points resulted in 512 frequency points per time window covering the frequency range 0 to 5MHz (half the sampling rate). The frequency points were 9.76kHz apart (5MHz/512) and the first frequency point of the spectrum was at 4.88kHz (9.76kHz/2). The first frequency point that fell in the selected frequency range of interest was at 53.68kHz (4.88 + 5?9.76); this became the first feature of the time window. The last feature of the time window got the number 67 and fell in 697.84kHz (66?9.76 + 53.68). The features 1 to 67 described the spectrum of the first time window, the features 68 to 134 the second time window etc, and the features 805 to 871 described the spectrum of the 13th and last time window. All 67 features of each time window were displayed in the Fig. 13. The normalization factor is added as feature 872. Each spectrum point was used as a "feature" whose value was the magnitude of the spectrum of the corresponding frequency.

The 872 features can be interpreted as the dimensions of a multidimensional space. Each waveform was represented by a point in this space. Some features of different classes have the similar value or are lowly significant. Such parameters (data features) only complicate the recognition problem. In order to reduce feature redundancy, the fisher ratio was used to help find the features of highest discrimination quality and to use them for efficient separation of classes. The fisher ratio was used as an indicator for the discriminative quality of a specific feature according to certain classes. Then 60 specific features    were selected for transformation that was highlighted. The following was obtained in Fig.12.

The back-propagation artificial neural network was designed to be a classifier as input 60 selected features and four classes as output one. Then, the network was trained to place each representative wave within its own class.

B. Classification Results The method was applied to 71 sets of data from the test.

The good predicting result was in Table II. The predicting correctness of class D was the  best among the four classes.

The other three ones were all below 80%. The error between class B and C was bigger. It showed that to some degree class B and C have the similar orientations because  class B was partly from the gestation of HIC. However, the pattern recognition method is still a reliable tool for identifying different classes.



VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, 20R steel plate specimen was exposed to a  H2S-saturated aqueous solution for hydrogen charging 6 days.

After the test, many hydrogen blisters and hydrogen induced cracklings was found in the steel. The following conclusions can be drawn:  ? Acoustic emission testing is an effective method to monitor HIC and corrosion for carbon steel.

? All available AE signals can be divided into three classes, class A, B and C, which stand for three different AE sources Model A with amplitude between 36dB to 52dB responded to corrosion of solution and process electrifying to charge hydrogen atom. The forming and breaking of FeS film by corrosion or the crack initiation may be the reasons caused model B, whose amplitude ranged from 52dB to 72dB. Model C has the highest amplitude of 72dB to 75dB, and it should attribute to the HIC extending.

?Metallographic study is a good evidence to show the links between AE activity and the HIC progress.

?The peak frequency of three kinds of AE signals were all located in 80?180kHz, but their amplitudes were different.

Therefore, the magnitude of the spectrum of the corresponding frequency can be used as the discriminating acoustic parameters. Through fisher ratio, resulting optimized AE- signal-feature set provides the maximal information with minimized number of selected AE signal parameters (selected features).

?The pattern identification method based on frequency- time series, fisher ratio and BP network is proven to be an effective one for AE waveforms.
