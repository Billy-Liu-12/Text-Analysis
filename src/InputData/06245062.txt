Automatic Prediction of Enzyme Functions from Domain Compositions   Using Enzyme Reaction Prediction Scheme

Abstract?Proteins perform most important biochemical reactions in organisms, such as the catalysis, signal transduction, and transport of nutrients. The urgent need of automatic annotation is due to the advent of high-throughput sequencing techniques in the post-genomic era. Proteins consist of domains which are elementary building units of protein folding, function, and evolution. The evidence of protein function is convincible to deduce from its domain composition.

For enzyme function prediction, efficiency and reliability become more and more important in the recent researches.

This study proposed an enzyme reaction prediction scheme with a learning model for enzyme function predictions to avoid the exponential enumeration problem of frequent item-sets in the association rule algorithm.  Our work also contributed to the prediction of multiple reactions due to the nature of enzymes.

I. INTRODUCTION Proteins perform most important biochemical reactions in  organisms, such as the catalysis, signal transduction, and transport of nutrients [1]. For a protein, it could perform different biochemical behaviors in various environments.

Recently, sequences are generated exponentially by high- throughput techniques in the post-genomic era. The capacity of manual annotation by experts has been not sufficient to support the fast growing data. This has widened the gap between novel protein sequences and characterized protein functions. Automatic annotation methods are beneficial in bridging the gap. The development of automated protein function annotation becomes more prevalent due to the abrupt imbalance on characterization.

For the protein function of great complexity, there are mainly two reliable schemes applied to facilitate the functional annotation: Gene Ontology (GO) scheme [2] and Enzyme Commission (EC) nomenclature [3]. GO is an available biological framework providing the ontology of gene product properties including the cellular component, molecular function, and biological process. Some research works that based on the GO scheme have been done [4]. EC nomenclature assigns four-field numbers to distinct enzyme reactions and organizes all enzymes into six major classes: (1) oxidoreductases; (2) transferases; (3) hydrolases; (4) lyases;  (5) isomerases; (6) ligases. Some studies have been done based on the EC nomenclature [5, 6].

Domains occupy an important position among relevant sequence features of a protein [4]. Protein consists of domains which are building units of protein folding, function, and evolution [7, 8]. The evidence of protein function is convincible to deduce from its domain composition. There are plenty of domain databases collected for different purposes, such as Pfam [9], CATH [10], SCOP [11], and InterPro [12]. Pfam is a sequence-based database collected by sequence alignment through the hidden Markov models (HMMs). CATH is a structure-based database curated by a combination of automated and manual techniques. SCOP database collects the evolutionary relationships of domains in proteins whose structures are known. InterPro is an integrated resource including protein families, domains, and binding sites. It comprises a number of member databases which provide the material through different methodologies.

Since the genome sequences which associated with proteins of known structures have allowed the investigation on the nature of domain compositions [7]. The structure-oriented database SUPERFAMILY in the InterPro database is extracted to establish the conformation of proteins out of the domain compositions. We adopted InterPro database for the property of cross-reference between many domain databases to investigate the relationship between domain compositions and protein functions.

Protein function assignment is considered to have an intimate linkage with domain compositions. Various groups of researchers have applied the computational techniques and machine learning algorithms to build the relationships between domain compositions and protein functions, including the decision tree [13], association rules [5], support vector machines (SVMs) [14], domain teams [15], probabilistically rule-based model [4], weighted domain architecture comparison tool (WDAC) [16], feature architecture comparison tool (FACT) [17], and so on. Since each branch of a decision tree conducts one kind of classes, such that it is hard to handle proteins with multiple functions.

For generating the frequent item-sets, association rule algorithm sets up the support and confidence thresholds to filter out the redundancy from the exponential enumeration.

From the inspiration of rule-based and probabilistic models, we designed the enzyme reaction prediction scheme with a learning model for multiple functional proteins to avoid the  * Corresponding author   DOI 10.1109/iCBEB.2012.88     exponential enumeration problem and rank all candidate rules by available criteria in this study.



II. DATA PREPARATION UniProt Knowledgebase is a comprehensive protein  sequence database which comprises manually annotated records and computationally analyzed records. Proteins with EC numbers were extracted from both Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL sets of UniProt knowledge database (Release 2011_07). We retained proteins which (i) have determined EC digits; (ii) are cross-referenced to the SUPERFAMILY (Version 1.73) domains in the InterPro database. For each domain, attributes including the start and end positions of each domain and domain ID were also extracted from the InterPro database.

According to the enzyme nomenclature proposed by Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (NC-IUBMB), there are four-field numbers assigned to different enzymatic activities. The first three digits of an EC number depict the overall type of enzymatic reaction and the last digit represents the substrate specificity of a reaction [18]. To consider the specificity of enzyme reaction, there are two types of datasets in our approach: the first-three-digit set and the all-four-digit set. There are 5,740 entries in the first- three-digit set and 5,203 entries in the all-four-digit set individually. In the comparisons with previous work, we divide each set into the single-EC case and the multiple-EC case. In the first-three-digit set, there are 3,760 entries in the single-EC case and 1,980 entries in the multiple-EC case. In the all-four-digit set, there are 3,123 entries in the single-EC case and 2,080 entries in the multiple-EC case.



III. METHODS This approach is relied in the rationale that a specific  domain composition represents a certain type of enzyme reaction. Hence, a protein consists of a domain composition that has an EC number (single-EC case). However, various domain compositions may share the same EC number. Even a protein could perform more enzyme reactions in fact, which could have more EC numbers (multiple-EC case).

Therefore, the relationship between the domain compositions and EC numbers can be seen as a many-to-many mapping problem. Most of previous research focused on solving the single-EC case. In this study, we conducted an enzyme reaction prediction scheme and attempted to solve this many- to-many mapping problem.

A. Association Rule (AR) Algorithm In the field of data mining, association rule algorithm is a  well-developed technique for detecting the relationship between items, especially for a large database. There are mainly two steps in the process. First, this method enumerates all frequent item-sets which selected through a support threshold. Second, explicit rules are made by means of a confidence threshold. For example, one rule in the all- four-digit set such as {SSF49879, SSF55785, SSF56112} -> EC 2.7.11.1 are retained for identifying the enzyme reaction.

The data mining package of Comprehensive Perl Archive  Network (CPAN) were performed in this study. The thresholds of support were 4 and 3 for the first-three-digit set and the all-four-digit set, respectively. The confidence values followed the literature [5] were both 0.6.

B. Enzyme Reaction Prediction (ERP) Scheme While a protein consists of several SUPERFAMILY  domains, our method attempted to discovery a representative domain composition and its corresponding EC numbers.

ERP scheme can be divided into two parts:  1) Domain subsets of the given protein were enumerated and ranked by the following criteria:  a) Existence of a protein which consists of the domain subset  If a protein was composed of the domain subset, we considered it to have contributed in direct way to the corresponding enzyme reactions. We preferred it than others that were not.

b) The ratio of proteins which consist of the domain subset exactly to proteins which contain the domain subset and other domains  As the above-mentioned rationale elucidates that a specific domain composition represents a certain type of enzyme reaction, an enzymatic function could be performed by a domain accompanying with other domains. Domains tend to combine with other distinct domains are called ?promiscuous? domains, which reflect the ability of a domain interact with other domains [19]. It is worth noting that what types of domain compositions are succinct for promiscuous domains. The following equation is provided a measurement of succinctness of a domain composition.

? ._ included  exact compdomain proteinss  proteins ssSuccinctne ? ? ????  c) Equilibrium Since one protein could cause several enzyme reactions,  its corresponding domain composition could perform more functions which contributed from the same composition of other proteins. An equation Equilibriumdomain_comp is proposed below to represent the strength of enzymatic functions performed by a domain composition.

If several domains appear in a protein together, the more concentration of enzymatic functions carries out the less equilibrium value. Among a list of domain compositions, we prefer the less equilibrium value which expresses the strength of performance of enzymatic functions. Figure 1 has a simple example to calculate Equilibriumdomain_comp.

d) The number of domains in the subset According to the principle of Occam?s razor, the most  succinct hypothesis is most likely the critical one. The less number of domains in a protein, the more preference is taken.

2) Enzyme reactions are sorted by the IntensityECi equation, which performed by proteins which include the domain composition determined by the above four criteria.

There are totally N proteins sharing k EC numbers and each EC number performed by ni proteins. The more specific enzyme reactions would be performed by more proteins sharing the same domain composition. To avoid the bias caused by the appearance of protein prevalence, we conduct the intensity with the mean value n . After comparing with n , the priority of ECi is higher as the less IntensityECi accompanying the higher ni. Figure 1 has a simple example to calculate IntensityECi.

Five-fold Cross-validation When a classification model is proposed, the model  parameters are optimized to fit the training set as well as possible through the fitting process. If we take another independent validation dataset from the same population to test the model, it is called over-fitting when the validation dataset does not fit as well as the training set. Cross- validation is a way to provide the fit inference of a model to a validation set.

We applied the five-fold cross-validation in this study.

The sample was divided into five subsets randomly; one  subset was used as the testing set and the other subsets as the training set. It meant that the first-three-digit set consists of 5,740 entries and was divided into five parts; the all-four- digit set consists of 5,203 entries and was divided into five parts as well. One round of five-fold cross-validation is taking one part as the testing set and the rest parts as the training set in turn. There are twenty rounds in this study.



IV. RESULTS AND DISSCUSSION This work was performed from two types of datasets  including the first-three-digit set and the all-four-digit set.

Five-fold cross-validation was applied to confirm the enzyme reaction prediction (ERP) scheme. The population of entries was shown in Table I and each fold was taking as the testing set in turn.

In the comparisons with association rule (AR) algorithm [5], entries of each fold were divided into the single-EC case and the multiple-EC case. The population of entries used to verify each model was listed on the ?Testing set? column in Tables II and IV. The ?Match? column is the number of entries which could fit individually one kind of domain compositions provided by each model. If one entry fits a certain domain composition and all target EC numbers are predicted correctly, it would be accumulated on the ?Hit? column.

The accuracy value calculated in Tables III and V is the ratio of entries predicted correctly to entries predicted. For the single-EC case, we can see that the accuracy of AR is better than that of ERP1 from Table II. However, the number of ?Match? by AR is less than that by ERP1. It means that the few entries could fit individually one kind of domain compositions by AR. Therefore, it is unfair to compare AR with ERP1 in Table II. Taking those entries could be predicted by AR into account, we can find that those entries could also be predicted by ERP1 and a fair comparison is shown on the column ?ERP2?. From Table 2, we can see that the accuracy of ERP2 is slightly better than that of AR.

Overall, AR and ERP both can predict the enzyme function well for the single-EC case. For the multiple-EC case, we can see that the accuracy of ERP1 and ERP2 is greatly better than that of AR, respectively, from Table V. The results showed that it is not useful for multiple enzyme function predictions by AR and the ERP could be a better choice.



V. CONCLUSION To conclude, this study confirmed the rationale that a  specific domain composition represents one or more certain types of enzyme reactions. An enzyme reaction prediction scheme was proposed and attempted to mine the relationship between the domain compositions and EC numbers. The experimental results showed that the enzyme reaction prediction scheme can predict the enzyme function well for the single-EC case. Moreover, the enzyme reaction prediction scheme could be a better choice than the association rule algorithm for multiple enzyme function predictions. This work contributed to get rid of exponential enumeration and facilitate the prediction of enzyme functions.
