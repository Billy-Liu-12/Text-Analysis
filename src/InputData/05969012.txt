I. INTRODUCTION Spatial data mining (SDM) refers to extracting and  ?mining? the hidden, implicit, valid, novel and interesting spatial or non-spatial patterns or rules from large-amount, incomplete, noisy, fuzzy, random, and practical spatial databases [1] [2]. At present, SDM mainly concentrated on the efficiency of mining algorithm itself [3][4]. Another important issue?application in SDM?have not been paid much attention.

Geological data are typical spatial data, which include geological, geophysical, geochemical, and remote sensing data. Mineral prospectivity analysis and quantitative resource assessment have been recognized as important when integrating multi-source geological spatial data in recent years [5]. The statistical and mathematical approaches developed recently for multi-resources geological spatial data integration include weights-of -evidence modelling [6]-[9], and the logistic regression model [10]-[12]. The fuzzy logic model [13], artificial neural networks model [14][15] and the fractal method [16] have been applied in the assessment of mineral resources potential. These methods promote the effectiveness of mineral resource prospecting. However, under the shortage of mineral resources and the leap cost of prospecting and exploring, how to make full use of the existing multi-sources geo-spatial data to find deep mining information through massive uncertain multi-source geology spatial database and  establish a rapid, efficient, intelligent method of mineral prediction to reduce the cost of mineral exploration and improve the efficiency and accuracy of mineral prediction is particularly important and urgent. These traditional statistical mathematical approaches and GIS spatial analysis technology is lack of intelligence and reasoning mechanism. In this paper, a spatial data mining method for mineral resources potential assessment was proposed.



II. THE SPATIAL DATA MINING FRAMEWORK FOR MINERAL RESOURCES POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT  The spatial data mining method for mineral resources potential assessment mainly include continuous geological spatial data discretization, spatial relationship abstracting and attribute transforming, mining metallogenic association rules and quality assessment, comprehensive evaluation of association rules and mineral potential mapping (Fig.1).

Firstly, the best ore-controlling variable and threshold were determined using proximity analysis of the weights-of- evidence model. On the basis of a correlation analysis among evidence variables, the authors selected vector ore-controlling data of stratum, unconformity, fault, regional geochemical data, remote-sensing mineralization information, bouguer gravity data, aeromagnetic data, and mineral occurrence for this experiment. Secondly, the cloud model was used to execute the uncertainty translation between continuous geology data and discrete geology data. Meanwhile, on the basis of apriori algorithm, the metallogenic association rules were abstracted and six uncertainty indexes-confidence, support, lift, coverage, leverage and interesting-were adopted to assess the quality of metallogenic association rules.



III. QUALITY ASSESSMENT INDEXES AND COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT  On the basis of Apriori association rules mining algorithm proposed by Agrawal et al.[17][18], the six quality assessment indexes[19][20]:confidence, support, lift, coverage, leverage and interesting were adopted.

A. Coverage The coverage of an association rule is the proportion of  case data that have the attribute values or items specified on the Left Hand Side(LHS) of the rule.

___________________________________     )(/)( LHSPNLHSnCoverage ??                                      (1) Where N is the total number of cases under consideration.

Coverage takes values in ]1,0[ .

if 1?Coverage then the rule is considered as an important association rule.

B. Support The support of an association rule is a proportion of all  cases in data set that satisfy a rule.

NRHSLHSnSupport /)( ??                                              (2) where LHS refers to Left Hand Side of the rule, RHS refers to Right Hand Side of the rule. Support corresponds to the statistical significance of the rule. A high support of the rule is an indication that a high number of tuples contains both LHS and RHS of this rule, i.e., the rule is representative of the considered data.

C. Confidence The confidence of an association rule is a proportion of the  cases covered by the LHS of the rule that are also covered by the RHS.

)(/)( LHSnLHSRHSnConfidence ??                                 (3) where n (LHS) denotes the number of cases covered by LHS, corresponds to the strength of a rule. It takes values in the interval ]1,0[ if 1?Confidence ,The rule is considered as most important.

D. Lift  Lift is a measure of the importance of the association.

)(/ RCPConfidenceLift ?                                        (4) If 1?Lift then RHS and LHS are independent, which  indicates that the rule is not important; If ???Lift , it has the following sub-case  If RPRC ? or RCRP ? , then the rule is not important.

If 0)( ?RCP , then the rule is not important.

If 1)|( ?RPRCP , the rule is interesting.

If 0?Lift means that 0)(0)|( ???? RPRCPRPRCP , which indicates that the rule is not important.

E. Leverage  ))(*)(()|( RPPRCPRPRCPLeverage 	?           (5) Leverage takes values in ]11[	 .

if 0 Leverage then there is a strong independence  between RHS and LHS if 1?Leverage which indicates that the rule is important  F. gInterestin Gray and Orlowska(1998) used the term, interesting, to evaluate the strength of associations between sets of items in association rules. Interestingness contains a discriminator  component to express an independent indication of the antecedent (X) and consequent (Y). Interesting is given by[16]:  mK YPXP YPXP  YXPI ))()(()1) )()(  )((( ?? ? ?  ?              (6)  where )( YXP ? is a ?confidence? )()( YPXP ? is a ?support?, )()(/)( YPXPYXP ?? is a discrimination and k and m are two parameters to weight the relative importance of the discrimination and support components. The rules with higher values of interestingness are considered more interesting.

Furthermore, the corresponding weights of six quality assessment indexes were calculated by analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method. According to the standardized six quality assessment indexes and item numbers of metallogenic association rules, the comprehensive assessment is as follows:  AHPcon*Confidence+AHPsup*Support +AHPlev*Leverage+AHPcov*Coverage  +AHPlift*Lift+AHPint*gInterestin+XiangShu =K (7)  According to the comprehensive assessment index K, we can perform the mineral resources potential assessment in study area.



IV. EXPERIMENTS The experiment of mineral potential assessment for iron  deposits was performed in Eastern Kunlun, Qinghai province, China, using spatial data mining method and weights-of- evidence model, respectively. All the data sets were derived from a multi-source geology spatial database (MGSDB) established by the Institute of Geo-Spatial Information Science and Technology, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China in 2009, which contains geological, geophysical, geochemical and remote sensing data. The algorithm is implemented with C# programming language.

The study areas were divided into three parts to assist the interpreting of the potential distribution of iron deposits. We defined the three target zones as high potential areas, moderate potential areas and low potential areas, respectively.

Using the weights-of-evidence model (Fig.2), low potential areas contain 32% of the total gold deposits, covering 75% of the total area; the high potential areas contain 48% of the total gold deposits, covering 10% of the total area; and the moderate potential areas contain 20% of the gold deposits, covering 15% of the total area; about 68% of known deposits are located in the moderate and high potential areas. Using the spatial data mining method in this paper (Fig.3), Low potential areas contain 8% of the total gold deposits, covering 75% of the total area; the high potential areas contain 72% of the total gold deposits, covering 10% of the total area; and the moderate potential areas contain 20% of the gold deposits, covering 15% of the total area. About 92% of known deposits are located in the moderate and high potential areas.

Furthermore, the field verification was performed (Fig.4), which 70% of iron deposits located in high and moderate potential areas. The results indicate that the prediction accuracy of spatial data mining was obvious higher than weights-of-evidence model?s, the method is suitable for    mineral resources potential assessment and its effectiveness is good.

Meanwhile, the experiments of mineral potential assessment for iron deposits was performed in Eastern Kunlun, Qinghai province, China, using spatial data mining method and weights-of-evidence model, respectively.
