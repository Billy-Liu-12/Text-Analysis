Study on updating method of DEM based on large-scale topographic map

Abstract?Our institude has a digital elevation model that is based on 2008 of ADS40 aerial photography production. DEM is already too old , in the nearly two years of actual use of this data. It have been found that the data is obviously not in line with the actual situation of the elevation .These problems generate direct result that DEM data is difficult to apply in areas which require the application of the three - dimensional GIS data such as urban planning , mobile base station location.

So we must generate new updating procedures of Large - scale topographic maps and digital elevation model(DEM)  Keywords-DEM;Big Scale;thiree dimentional, topographic maps

I. INTRODUCTION  Use of aerial photography for DEM is a method of short cycle and high precision. As choosing the weather for Photography is very difficult ,technical equipment is every expensive and chinese air traffic control is very strict, only some national projects rely on aerial photography. The remaining large amount of data need to get through post-processing of existing topographic maps.

In our institude (guangzhou urban planning & design survey research institude) ?1235? large scale topographic maps update mechanism in our hospital has been established.

Since 2008 a lot of 1:500,1:2000,1:5000 topographic map data have been updated, these data are typical of short period, rich information and high actuality, and have a large number of elevation points, contour information. In accordance with the job requirements , elevation points , contour elevation have already been assigned the height value. It is meaningful for using these elevation data and contour lines to construct a TIN model ,furthermore generate the digital elevation model(DEM). There are already some researches in china, like Study of DEM Quickly-building Based on Large-scale Relief Maps (1), Quality Inspection and Assessment of DEM Based on 1:10000 Scale DLG (2), The Feasibility Application of DEM Technical Production Improvement in Basic Surveying and Mapping Projects (3) etc.

The main flow is as follows Prepare DLG map sheet, check stitch DLG map  sheet draw feature point , polyline, polygon process point , line and polygon data data fusion , check , data conversion build Triangulated Irregular Network(TIN),by vector data interpolate to generate grid DEM cut DEM according to map sheet convert and  check DEM data format check , modify , edge match DEM data submit DEM data, documentation.

After DEM data acquisition is completed, DEM data check, modify and edge match is also tedious job. In order to avoid heavy work in three-dimensional environment check, we use the skyline SDK to develop a professional software tool for data editing and organization. In a two-dimensional interface, by importing DEM data, contour lines are generated as a reference. Users can observe the shape of the contour, then edit DEM elevation points which does not comply with the actual situation.



II. TECHNOLOGY ROADMAP  As DEM is produced by ADS40 digital aerial camera video aquired in 2008, there are significant differences with current status in some areas. In order to complete the project requirements as better as possible, we update DEM using elevation points and contour data from the latest 1:500,1:2000,1:5000 topographic data. In this way ,we ensure that the DEM data present potential.

The general process is as follows: 1. Import the current DEM ,images and the new 3D  DLG data to the three-dimensional environment,then users can decide whether it needs to be updated according to the change of DEM.

2. By DLG data , we build TIN triangular model, then interpolate to generate DEM data   DOI 10.1109/ICDMA.2013.319     Figure 1 reproduce DEM by DLG  1 Build TIN triangulation network using elevation points , contours  Major steps: 1) Preprocess; a) Check if there is hidden height gross error; b) Interpolate and encrypt processing elevation point  column which is sampling in a too large space in the same contour line, to avoid triangle grids crossing contour lines.

c) Interpolate feature points or feature lines automatically in closed contours without elevation points like hills ,depressions, saddle back, long and narrow valley where slope is gentle, etc.

2) Interpolation; Iteratively interpolate based on nested multi-resolution  iterative calculation, then check the reasonableness and process for optimization  3) Data Smoothing Use the fitting surface to smooth the landscape which is  produced by interpolation.

4) Terrain reinforce `By recognition of terrain feature points of  DEM(depression area, saddle area) and terrain feature lines hidden in elevation points and contour lines, the interpolation algorithm is restricted by an array of simple ordered chain constraints. In this way of using aspect turning line, topographical features on the terrain surface can be expressed more accurately.

5) Local adaptive processing Due to the terrain mutations, some errors will still exist .

For this profile curvature is introduced, which defines a new roughness penalty function for local adaptive process. In this process the interpolated DEM is used to anti-generate contour lines. so that the original contour lines can superimposed showing by different colors .

Check the deviation for corresponding contour lines ,then edit points and polygons of DEM in areas which exceed tolerences.

3. Import Irregular DEM data to the whole Guangzhou digital elevation model and update ,then edge match the DEM data.

1) Cut and edit map sheet edge.

2) Cut map sheet according to the scope involved.

3) Edge match with neighborhood map sheets in the  rule of with only three directions of west, north and northwest.

4) If different contour intervals are adopted in adjacent map sheets, edge match error is calculated according to the larger one.

5) On the grid points within the tolerance range, the point elevation is calculated by the average value of two or three corresponding points.



III. KEY TECHNOLOGY 1 Massive three-dimensional data storage technology  based on Skyline .

The skyline toolkit adopts advanced technologies like  three-dimensional multi - level data storage switching technology , image pyramid technique , three-dimensional model of the multi- level of detail (LOD) technology , multi - thread scheduling technology , therefore multi-source and multi-scale mass data are able to be integrated into relational database seamlessly(4) .

Among these technologies, image pyramid technology is a means of rational use of system resources. When faced with the huge amount of data needs, if we transfer all the data to the system in one time, a lot of system resources will be wasted. Therefore the requirements of the computer's hardware configuration are relatively high, and the speed of the system will be severely affected. The image pyramid technology only transfer real-time data in viewable perspective within a reasonable resolution, in this way the system required fewer resources, greatly improving the interactive performance.

The multi - level of detail (LOD, LevelOfDetails) model will be displayed at different levels of detail based on the proximity of the viewpoint. In the near viewpoint, a very detailed model is expressed, otherwise in the far viewpoint, the simple model to express. In the way we will greatly lighten the overhead of the system. In the meantime , in the far view point the phenomenon of superimposed faces flicking can be eased.

2 Nested multi-resolution iterative calculation(5) Nested multi-resolution iterative calculation method is  adopted in the production. It has the efficiency of local interpolation method without losing the advantages of continuity of global interpolation method. Interpolation computation begins from the initial coarse resolution (typically for the ultimate resolution of 8-11 times) , with each reduced to one half, gradually decreasing to a minimum resolution set by the user .For data of each resolution, if there is data near the fitting point, it will be given the height value directly. Otherwise, the height value will be calculated using the method of Gauss-Seidel iteration under restriction of terrain roughness and terrain constraint line.

In the entire process of interpolation calculation, each resolution DEM are recorded in the memory. It is possible     to monitor the input source data quantity according to the surface characteristics (such as slope, curvature, etc.). In a coarser resolution level, since the raster grid is larger, the value of each grid point is the average of a lot of observation points, thereby terrain is flat. With the decreasing grid size, the grid values will not or few calculated by averaging observation point values, and the surface slope grew steeper and eventually stabilize at a certain level. According to this feature, the best the raster size can be determined objectively.

For the determination of the grid size, this approach is more objective, operational compared with the TIN establishing DEM method,  3 penalty function Noisy data are often included in interpolation  data(observation data) , and observation data points are generally uneven distributed and their number is far less than the number of fitting surface grids. Interpolation algorithm is not very stable , which will generate several non- real terrain phenomenon ( artefacts ) on the surface. In order to avoid this phenomenon and give an objective evaluation of the interpolating effect, roughness penalty function ( Roughness Penalty ) is introduced. For the reasonable use of the function , the fitting surface can be obtained in a compromise proposal, which means the predicted value is close to the measured value , in the meantime smooth the fit surface . In other word, estimates and measured values become closer while avoiding the estimates of mutation ( jerkiness )  Roughness penalty function is defined by the curvature of fitting surface. ANUDEM method introduced three curvature, including surface gravity potential curvature , total curvature and profile curvature ( formula 1, 2, 3 ) . The initial algorithm proposed an empirical formula (Formula 4) , define roughness coefficient J (f ) by a combination of J1 (f) and J2 (f) , where h is the grid size . The test showes, compared to using only J1 or J2 , J (f) can be made more satisfactory interpolation results

V.CONCLUSION The conventional DEM production is the use of a fully  digital photogrammetric workstation complete three-dimensional mapping process. This process make the DEM mapping cycle, low efficiency , personnel needs , and thus the production is the heavy workload, restricting and impacting the rapid development of the basic geographic information. In this method we can shorten the DEM 's mapping cycle of the aerial industry production , improve production efficiency and save production costs and labor time , and improve the accuracy of the product.

By the product of this project ,we can ensure product quality , improve work efficiency and produce DEM digital products meeting the accuracy requirements. So this method meet the trends of DEM updates, and has a strong application prospects .
