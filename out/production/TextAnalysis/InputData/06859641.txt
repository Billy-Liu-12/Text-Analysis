From Learning to E-learning to M-learning to C- learning to ... ?

Abstract ? Need for Higher Education is growing rapidly - by 2020 two thirds of all jobs will require postsecondary education [1]. The current higher education system cannot satisfy this need in many fields, e.g. Gartner predicts, that already in 2015 only a third of jobs for big data analysts can be filled [2].

The rapid development of Information and Communication Technology (ITC, IT) has changed many aspects of teaching and learning. Educational materials are moving into cloud(s) and degrees are given on-line ('Master?s Degree Online Directory' lists over 90,000 programs [ 3 ]), old- fashioned Colleges and Universities with large campus, staff and high costs are getting more and more competition from numerous educational entrepreneurs, who start massive open online courses (MOOC) with millions of users/students from all around the world; they establish new on-line universities where costs of obtaining a degree are marginal compared to 'brick-and-mortal' universities and which are open to nearly everyone independent of user geographical location. Until now MOOC have not yet proved their value - less than 4% of enrollees complete the courses [4] and they do not receive (yet) university diploma. But the World most prestigious technical university, MIT, has already set up a certification system - students who can master the subjects taught in MOOC receive an official certificate of completion [5]. Although these certificates will not carry the weight of a traditional MIT diploma (they will be issued by started by MIT online learning initiative called MITx), but the word 'MIT' alone carries a weight.

When speaking about possibilities of IT in education most speakers/writers are excitedly discussing technology - servers, communication lines, bandwidth, security (preferably all in thick cloud of technical jargon). Nearly nobody presents practical experience, suggestions and/or theories about how to teach with this new technology in order best to utilize its possibilities. The 'education in the cloud' mainly consists of video clips trying to repeat the classroom experience: recorded before the old-fashioned blackboard (only nowadays it is white), where professor is presenting the same lecture what he presented in lecture hall, only now lectures are cut into 5-10 min video clips - the 'mobile approach'. Is this why the old lecture halls are still needed?

Rapidly increasing costs of University Education, increasing competition of educational entrepreneurs and constant increase of population of working students have made clear, that both sides of University education - teaching/learning and accrediting, giving diplomas need changes. University Education should more take into account students informal  and non-formal learning, their participation in professional work - both in organization of study and in certification.

In the following are considered several aspects of current situation, presented practices which authors use when teaching IT students and examined possible changes in universities teaching and certification methods.



I. INTRODUCTION Advancements in technology are constantly reshaping  our teaching/learning/training practices.

In last 10..15 years, the biggest influence for educational practice have had computers and Internet Technologies (IT) and their role is increasing, especially for delivering training. The impact of IT to education was characterized in developed countries already in 15 years from now as the ?e-Learning Revolution? [ 6 ],[ 7 ].

Currently the E-learning revolution has started or is starting even in rural Africa [ 8 ], while developed countries have already embraced the M-learning revolution [9], our classrooms have become cloudy [10], [11] and some are moving classrooms into boxes (?the classroom in a box?) [12], [13].

Technology and buzz-words around it have changed rapidly. But disparity between what goes into higher education and what many get out of it are not always encouraging.

Greek writer Aristophanes complained already more than 2,000 years ago in his comedy 'The Clouds' [14], that universities ('Thinkeries with quacks') left students heavily indebted and without practical skills. Clouds, the 'patron goddesses of thinkers and other layabouts' arrives in the comedy singing majestically and promising with teachings from professor 'Inferior Argument' earthly 'summum bonum' and a life of ease and pleasure, typical of men who know how to talk their way out of trouble.

Headings indicate, that little has changed during the last 2000 years, except that youth less and less believes that professors can lead them to life of ease and pleasure : "Student Loan Problems: One Third Of Millennials Regret Going To College" [15], "Graduate data reveal England?s lost and indebted generation " [ 16], "Today?s College Graduates: In Debt and Unable to Find a Job" [17].

The forerunner of the computer revolution in education has been USA - very innovative country, the very birthplace of computers, PC, the iPad and also initiator of application of computers in education  MIPRO 2014, 26-30 May 2014, Opatija, Croatia     [18],[19]. Creativity and innovation have always been in USA highly valued [20]. But recent research indicates, that creativity of American children is on decline [21].

Has something gone wrong with rapid advance from learning to e-leaning to m-learning to c-learning (c- cloud, [22]) to ... - and if, then what ?



II. LEARNING Education is the most complex area of production.

Schools take in young human beings and try to develop their  minds - create an 'added value' - and charge either society or directly the customer, student. But at the same time those minds, their ways of life are also rapidly changing and these changes happen quicker than changes in big systems - in universities, in the whole European Higher Education Area [23].

Learning occurs constantly, ?from cradle to grave?. In 1996 the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member states agreed to develop lifelong learning strategy, which includes formal, non- formal and informal learning [24], [25].

The formal learning is highly structured and implemented by specialized organizations - schools.

Formal learning is intentional, schools and learners have explicit objectives covering knowledge, skills and competences, what learner should get.

Informal learning is learning from life experience - language acquisition, accepting cultural norms and social behavior. This is happening all the time, everywhere and is not intentional nor organized.

With development of society everything becomes more organized, thus also learning which happens not in schools tends to be organized. An example are Massive Open On-Line Courses (MOOC), which are rapidly gaining popularity, e.g. the Khan Academy [26] provides every month online lessons for more than 10 million visitors from about 200 countries. Organized 'outside school' learning is by OECD terminology non-formal learning. This kind of learning is very accessible - lessons/videos can be followed even on iPhone, iPad or Android phones [27]. While the first MOOC (Udacity, Codeacademy, Khan Academy) were focused on math, computer programming and computer science, currently MOOC are providing very broad selection of courses and new providers appear constantly. Even the World Economic Forum (WEF) announced at its last meeting about launch of its Forum Academy, where the huge network of industry leaders and opinion-makers of WEF will make their expertise and visions available to the global audience [28].

All these 'educational entrepreneurs' are directly moving into universities playground - several already provide accreditations. Currently they are mostly just for participation. But this is comparable with universities - participating, 'seat time' is in universities also often considered as something that gives students 'deeper understanding' (whatever this is), thus as a base for passing a course, although a correct mark were "Great Listener - constantly gave a nod of assent!")  Many university apparatchik's are doing everything in their power to make sure that universities continue to function the way they have. The notable difference is steady increase in the number of universities non-teaching staff, e.g. in the flagship Stanford University, USA - 3-5% every year [ 29 ]) - the first 'Thinkerie with quacks', Socrates, managed to shepherd his disciples to 'earthly summum bonum' alone.

And the academic staff should produce more and more 'bubbls' ('bubblications' - many are very soft inside).

Universities consider the formal learning as the only 'real' learning and want to continue in traditions of the Bologna university dating back to 1088. But students learn more and more in spheres of non-formal, informal learning, acquire skills and appreciation in many (professional) social networks. Universities should find a way to consider all these tendencies.



III.STUDENTS Today's students are different from what they were  five years ago and in the next year they will be even more different. Young people accept changes, especially new technology, much easier than their peers in universities.

Today's students are multitasking and collaborative; they're constantly connected and use multiple devices for being connected. They're highly visual and experiential; they're action- and just-in-time-oriented.

They value highly their time, since most of them work, often full-time.

Students are worldwide increasingly participating in work life, e.g. the U.S. Census report indicated that 71 percent of college undergraduates and 82 percent of graduate students were working in 2011 [30]. In Estonia and in Finland, more than two-thirds of students are employed. The official statistics possibly do not indicate the real percentage, since e.g. for an IT student it is very easy to work (e.g. create www-sites) from home or even from computer class at university and not to indicate (for taxation) all sources of income. When the first author asked students in Feb 2014 his group (83 IT specialty first -year students) in the opening lecture, all students indicated, that they work. Even the academic time-tables have been already for several years adjusted for working students - some weekdays are free, but on some days lectures/exercises end at 21.00  Research results indicate, that working does not reduce academic achievements [31],[32], even contrary, working students are more organized, value their time and manage to achieve good results in their studies. This clearly shows in their behavior in lectures and exercises - they never just sit there, they are very active and want to get maximum what teacher can provide. Besides Facebook and Google+ accounts they have accounts in LinkedIn, StackOverflow, Quora, Scribd and in many other professional, topic- oriented social networks.

If they want to solve a problem, learn something, then they ask in on-line professional forums. Some are already answering professional questions posed by others and thus earning the appreciation. And for courses which they just want to pass, they share their essays, presentations,     laboratory exercises, answers to test questions etc in online databases like "Ucionica.hr je banka znanja na internetu" [33] or [34] (the Estonian version).

In these professional social networks they learn a lot and their knowledge in some areas connected with their work exceeds that of their professors in the university.

The generations X (the ?lost? generation, some of them still study) and Y (Millennials) [35],[36] grow with Internet and have developed different techniques for solving their problems:  ? googling .The first thing they do in computer class - they start Google and whatever problem with e.g.

programming languages syntax - they google, and usually get necessary piece of knowledge already from the Google's page of results, without opening any page from there. This is a very useful habit and allows them quickly start using new applications - nowadays everything changes very quickly and it is pointless to try to memorize all UI/syntax details.

? hacking. They read program code much quicker than older generations (their peers) and grasp instantly the general structure, the information flow of a program - what is imported/input, what is exported/output and understanding of the structure allows them make modifications without even reading the whole text of the program - another very useful technique in our quickly changing world  Role of every kind of non-formal and informal learning and non-academic techniques is increasing and universities have not yet found adequate responses. As a result the millennials increasingly question the value of university education. A PhD students of the first author complained after successful defense, that in employment interviews several reviewers suggested him to remove mention of his PhD degree from his Curriculum Vitae - he looked 'over-educated'. His interests and  practice before entering doctorate was management of IT projects. But there were no IT projects waiting for managers - all IT projects were invented (with financial help from the Ministry of Economy or crowd sourcing) to be managed by similarly desperate project managers (and most failed).

IV.CAN TECHNOLOGY REPLACE TEACHERS ?

Education is a rather expensive sector in every  government budget. In Finland expenses for education during the last ten years have been over 13%; in Estonia - around 12% [ 37 ]. So it is understandable, that governments want to reduce this item of expenses, suggesting use of more technology in schools, which should make  teachers more effective or replace them.

Attempts of using technology for educating masses have long history. Already in 1920's started in USA educational radio broadcasts; later appeared educational TV, the PLATO - Programmed Logic for Automatic Teaching Operations (Automatic Teaching!) and currently MOOC. But all these ventures show very low course completion rates, e.g. the study from University of Pennsylvania revealed, that in average MOOC courses complete only 4% of users [38].

The number of on-line educational materials is growing exponentially. Most of them are short (5-10min) videos.

Most of these videos try to repeat the classroom experience and have been created in traditional style of university lectures - a 'speaking head'- style video, where professor reads chapters from his own textbook, occasionally jotting some hard to understand handwritten characters/figures/schemas on the blackboard (modern professors have already whiteboard).

Video is far less interactive than printed book. With book user can slip pages, look for references, skip uninteresting sections, with video one has to follow everything with video's speed. This breaks the fundamental principle of UI (User Interface) design: user, not the computer, should always have control. Videos cannot have links to outside materials and user can not copy-paste formulae or data from a video.

Video clips exploit very little of human's audio-visual capabilities. Bandwidth of human eye's is ca 10 Mbps (million bits per second ) [39], ears - 1.4 Mbps, i.e. we receive every second ca 11.4 Mb of information.

Bandwidth of educational video clips e.g. in YouTube is on average only 4500 kbps (everyone can check - right- click on clip and select 'Stats for nerds'), thus these clips engage only a quarter of our input capacity. But a weaker signal creates also weaker perceptions [40].

Figure 1. Sensory (visual+audio) signals are in classroom lecture many times stronger than in educational video from WWW.

Video lectures are for many more difficult to comprehend than the actual textbook which has been used, if there are formulae or data which user should write down, there are references to topics which are not covered in this particular lecture - from video user can not copy- paste and video does not support links. The widely used by universities simultaneous reading the slide text with voice ('speaking head') is useful only for users with reading disabilities, for other users it makes text comprehension more difficult [ 41 ], although some research claims (for different age group) the opposite [42].

Figure 2. 'Speaking head' reading the text of 20 slides. User should watch for 10min 47sec,  in order to get the data and formulae, user     should pause the video and manually wrote everything down (no copy- paste, no links).

A good on-line study material should be self-contained - it is easy to open another paragraph from book, but rather troublesome to find another video clip explaining missing issues. And the aim should be to explain the topic, not to show the professor.

However, some video clips are really excellent - self- contained, with content menu  and using the best features of digital media - animations, sound/voice; examples are e.g. the Introduction to Modern Information Theory [43] from Khan Academy or the winners of the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) Video Competition, a collaboration between Khan Academy, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and the Association of American Medical Colleges AAMC [ 44 ]. As this last example shows, students can make better educational materials than professors - students know, what their fellow students need.

There are many educational tutorials on WWW about nearly everything. They have been created without considering traditions of university lecture, but considering audience - to whom this may be useful - and maximally utilizing latest technical possibilities of modern browsers, e.g. allow to demonstrate interaction of different parts of www-page - html code, JavaScript, CSS [45].

And IT students already use these for learning far more than university lectures - lectures are for many only for getting diploma.



V. BEST PRACTICES The technology is not the lesson presented by a live teacher. The competition in (higher) education is all the time becoming stronger and under the pressure of it, all teachers are seeking better practices in their teaching. The following are suggestions following from our everyday practices.

A. Activate, engage students Getting students and professors together in a lecture  room is an effort which has a cost - both students and professor's time, the lecture room etc. This time should not be wasted to make students passive listeners of oracle, who is (often) reading passages from his own book and who (often) has never tried to implement his recipes in some real business enterprise.

The advancement in communication technology have made such sessions of passive listening utterly senseless.

Students could listen/watch these sermons online. The precious time when the whole group and professor are face-to-face should be used actively.

Many studies have shown, that learning is effective only when students are actively engaged in the learning process. Thus the first what lecturer should do is  Engage, activate students, make them active participants, make a lecture/practice active dialog instead of one-sided sermon!

B. The Flipped classroom University education is a rare (probably only) field of  social activity which has nearly not changed from the  times when first universities appeared in 11th..12th centuries - many of them are still active [46].

Proud of longevity and academic traditions professors continue to deliver lectures nearly the same way as did their predecessors during centuries: top-down, deductively - first the lecture explaining theory and then some examples and exercises illustrating the theory. This is the test-oriented method of teaching - tell students exactly what students need to know for the test, nothing more, nothing less.

In order to acquire knowledge and not simply to pass tests gives the inductive,  problem-based learning, discovery learning, inquiry learning much better results than deductive [47]. Learning should start from a case, a problem, a story what students can understand. This is  the Scahnk's  story-based teaching method [48].

An often used tradition is to assign at the end of a lecture readings for home. But usually teachers discover at the start of the next lecture, that nobody has done their readings. Thus instead of continuous crying "How to get them to Do the Readings ?" maybe it is time to ask, whether this tradition should be changed. The essential knowledge, which earlier was assigned as home readings after a lection, should be discussed in class, but in order the discussion to be successful, students should first do some exercises from on-line tutorials, where are assigned on-line materials which present theory.

C. Use on-line materials and video clips Teachers should use the best examples of the vast and  rapidly growing pool of freely (still!) available materials.

It has no sense to invent the bicycle or to sit a long evening trying to compile an animation for your next lecture, which will run in couple of seconds. There are already lot of ready material on-line - use it!

D. Hackers style The most influential figures in modern computing  world - Bill Gates, Steve Jobbs, Mark Zuckerberg and others where college drop-outs. Instead of theories they wanted to 'see how this thing works'.

Understanding the general, 'top-down' structure, flow of information in a program or a system is a very valuable ability, which allows quickly to understand new systems and programs (and currently they appear nearly every day). Many students already possess this ability - they see instantly, where is a closing bracket of a block or function, which lines have syntax errors etc. For instance, when the first author showed in class program lines which caused the recent Apple's SSL/TLS bug [ 49], several students quickly indicated the erroneous line. Many university teachers consider such 'top-down' style as 'non-serious' and even dangerous, but rapid increase of new systems and technologies makes this approach inevitable  everyone want first to see how it works, how it can be used and only (if it can be used) -  what are the details. The quick advancement of HTML5 is due just to its openness - everyone can investigate, 'how this works'.

E. Give students more choise In his commencement speech Steve Jobbs described  his decision to drop out from college: "... it was one of the     best decisions I ever made. The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn't interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting."  Students, especially working students, are well aware of developments in their field, since companies follow all the time, what is happening in their field - this determines their success or failure. They should have more freedom in selecting courses, for visiting or not visiting lectures and presenting their projects for credits. The rigid division to semesters and sessions is very questionable, e.g. why can teacher assess the achievements of a student only in pre-determined time, during the examination session? The marks go to university's database (the Studies Information System); this system runs like all server databases 7/24, so should also be accessible 7/24. Some universities are already experimenting with more flexible practices, e.g.

the Rio Salado College in Arizona allows for a semester 48 start times in a year [50].



VI. EXAMPLE CASE Some of relevant practices are illustrated in the  following with a brief overview of first author's exercise class in theme "3D communication" in spring 2014.

Participants were first year bachelor students, this was the semester's first exercise and the exercise was the first step for creating 3D web shop window, where customers could freely manipulate 3D objects.

A. Story In 2008 appeared in Apple on-line store for iOS  applications an app, which showed on screen a glowing gem with some lines of verse ("I'm rich...); the application was described as "a work of art with no hidden function at all" (i.e. just a picture), prize - 999.99 USD. During the first day eight people bought it, then Apple removed the app [51].

The story noticeably enlivened students and they started to create an enormous (1m x 1m x 1m) 3D diamond, which they could expose rotating on their www- sites using the html5/WebGL (the result: [52]).

B. Using on-line tutorials The 3d model was created with Sketchup; students  followed the YouTube tutorial [53].

C. Gamification The indicated tutorial (and the following steps) could  be improved, thus students were encouraged to propose improvements. The 3D model was improved with creating an additional upper bevel with author's initials (not part of on-line tutorial).

Figure 3. Upper bevel and author's initials  Those, who could propose improvements to the tutorial, could implement the additional bevel and remove  unnecessary hidden surfaces earned credits - +-points, which will be considered in course final assessment.

D. Hacking The 3D- model was transformed in Collada format to  html5 document. For this was quickly (3-5 minutes) introduced the Javascript WebGl package three.js [54].

The whole package is > 200 MB, therefore students copied to assigned to them hard disk area only some files, first the examples/webgl_loader_collada.html and all files needed to run them in browser (they had to investigate the Javascript import clauses and create a corresponding directory structure). When the monster from webgl_loader_collada.html become alive, they had to create a directory parallel with monster's directory, export there from Sketchup their precious stone in Collada format and replace the monster's import with import of their Collada object. For additional points they had first to replace rotation of the world with rotation of the stone only; better students could also add camera control hacking the file , examples/misc_controls_orbit.html.

After 90 min (end of the class) all students succeeded in creating the rotating stone in html5 page. Those, who did not understand everything, had to consider at home everything from the www-tutorial (the 'flipped' classroom).



VII. FUTURE OF TECHNOLOGIES It is very difficult to predict - changes are all the time  accelerating. However, most technologies have up to now followed the Gartner's Technology Hype development stadiums, which illustrates utilization of emerging technologies [55]:  Peak of Inflated  expectations  Through of Disillusionment  Slope of Enlightenment  Plateau of productivity  Vi si bi lit y  Peak of Inflated  expectations  Through of Disillusionment  Slope of Enlightenment  Plateau of productivity  Vi si bi lit y  MaturityMaturity  Figure 4. The Technology Hype curve (Gartner [55])  Some of education-connected technologies are currently in the following stadiums(for the full list check [56]):  ? On the Rise:  Open Microcredits - free or low-cost way to demonstrate competency in some area; some number of them could be used to obtain a certificate or diploma [57], [58];  Student Retention CRM - relationship management software, which helps to identify at-risk students     before retention and predicts and reports student behavior to faculty members and administrators; replacing a drop-out student costs twice;  Affective Computing - procedures to influence our emotions and other affective phenomena (could become a part of the previous);  ? At the Peak (beginning to drift down):  MOOC - the initial enthusiasm around MOOC is cooling down [ 59 ], since on university level participants of MOOC  courses (even with on-line mentors to interact with students, 1:100) showed much weaker results compared to equivalent live classes on campus [4], thus currently their main application area seems to be professional training for enterprises, but many universities still believe in the bright  future of MOOC [60];  BYOD - allowing employees, business partners and other users to use personal devices - laptops, tablets, mobile phones -  to execute enterprise applications and access data is inevitable trend, but brings along several dangers: the personal devices are usually connected with social networks, so " by 2017, 40 percent of enterprise contact information will have leaked into Facebook" and in average 20% of personal devices are compromised by malware ;  Big Data - used e.g. for analyzing MOOC performance issues  ? Sliding Into the Trough :  Social Learning Platform for Education; Mobile-Learning Smartphones; Virtual Environments/Virtual Worlds;  ? Climbing the Slope:  Open-Source Learning Repositories.



VIII. CONCLUSIONS Universities have two contradictory roles in the world  of learning: distributing knowledge, teaching and evaluating their own work with diplomas. Both of these roles - teaching and certificating - got their established forms long time ago, when world was small and closed; in our open, connected world both these functions have lot of pressure for modifications.

The university teaching should embrace all existing tendencies for non-formal, informal education and the new skills of students:  googling - ability to find quickly relevant information from the World biggest data resource - Internet;  hacking - understanding the information flows, the essential structure of a system - an enterprise, (local) government;  multitasking - simultaneous handling of several tasks;  being all the time connected  etc  University teaching, distributing new knowledge should better use the rich and constantly renewing source of knowledge - Internet. Physical, i.e. publishing on paper  is all the time becoming more expensive and the published materials are always first prepared in digital form - why to bother publishing on paper ? All materials are much easier to distribute and access on Internet. Scientific reports and journals, conference proceedings etc increasingly appear on-line.

People like to teach - creating a tutorial is the best way to understand a topic and new tutorials on newest IT application areas appear in Internet constantly. Most of them are free - the Wikipedia has been created for free.

Wikipedia is referential, not designed for learning, but there are already many pedagogically well-designed tutorials covering many areas of IT.

Certification (giving diplomas) may disappear altogether. When diploma is not any more a guarantee for earthly 'summum bonum' and government ministers obtain their diplomas giving them 'a life of ease and pleasure' with copy-paste techniques [61], then - why to bother, spend 4-6 years under extreme strain and then when receiving the diploma discover that (at least) half of your hardly obtained knowledge is already obsolete [62], [63] ?

Microcredentials - digital ?badges? [ 64 ] - are increasingly respected as a representation of a credential and accepted proof of knowledge, skills or achievements [ 65 ]. They digital, thus much more foolproof than classical paper diplomas. Contrary to diplomas, which reflect only the state of (academic) knowledge of the owner at the time of issuing, the microcredentials evolve with e.g. every proper answer in SourceForege or LinkedIn. They are open and public, everyone can support or disprove them.

Some creative minds, self-proclaimed ?most experienced organization in professional licensure and certification services? [66] or "Institute for Credentialing Excellence" [67]  already claim that they are the "only true source of this kind of information". It is difficult to believe, that this additional item of expenses for obtaining credentials can live long - diplomas are already too expensive. Everything is becoming open. The achievements obtained in open professional networks are easy to check and hard to forge - who needs additional (costly) 'certification services' ?
