Application of Grey-markov Model in Order Forecasting of Distribution

Abstract   The quickly changing market advances higher requirement for distribution center. It is pivotal for improving the flexibility and competence of distribution center to operate the distribution center according to the order, which represents the customers? demand.

Therefore, the precise order forecasting is very important for distribution center. Because the influencing factors of order forecasting are indeterminate, it leads to a big discrepancy between the order forecasting and the reality. This paper has established and applied grey-markov model, which unifies the GM (1, 1) model and the Markov process model, to forecast the order in distribution center. The forecasting result of actual order data demonstrates the forecasting result of grey-markov model is fair accurate and well applicable.

1. Introduction   The customers? demand has the characteristics of rapid change and individuation. So it is pivotal for the survival and competition ability of the distribution center to attract customers as many as possible, which depends on whether the distribution center could cope with the change of the market in time and satisfy the customers? demand to the maximum. Therefore, the order, which represents the customers? demand, is the headstream and destination of the operation of distribution center. The accurate forecast of the order volume of distribution center can provide data support to the determination of the order point and order quantity, which is able to reduce inventory cost,  increase satisfied rate of customers, make the organization of the procurement, production and distribution more effectively. As a result, the total benefit and competition ability of distribution center can be improved greatly.

As the influencing factors of the order generating are indeterminate, the information system of order volume is a typical of grey system, so the grey forecasting model can be used to forecast the order volume of distribution center. However, for the stochastic and fluctuating order volume data, the forecasting accuracy of grey model decreases. On the basis of the analysis of the GM (1, 1) model and the Markov process model, this paper unifies above two models to establish the grey-markov model, then applies the model to forecast the order volume in distribution center.

2. GM (1, 1) model   The modeling method of GM(1, 1) model is as  follows: supposed there is a series of original data?that is (0) (0) (0) (0) (0){ (1), (2), (3), ..., ( )}X X X X X n= . Through accumulation, it generates a series of new data, that is (1) (1) (1) (1) (1){ (1), (2), (3), ...., ( )}X X X X X n= , in which  (1) (0)( ) ( ), 1, 2, ...,  k X k X i k n  i = =?  = . Then the corresponding  Differential equation of GM (1, 1) model is (1)  (1)dX aX  dt ?+ =  Assumed [ ]?

Solving the Differential equation, it can get the forecasting model  (1) (0)? ?( 1) [ (1) ] akX k X e a a ? ??+ = ? +  Restoring the solution, it can obtain the forecasting formula of the series of original data, which is  (0) (0)? ?( 1) (1 )[ (1) ] , 1, 2, a ak  X k e X e ka ? ?  + = ? ? = Fina  lly, adopt the posteriori method to verify the accuracy of forecasting model.

3. Markov process model   Supposed the Markov Chain is { },Xn n T? , for any integers , ( 1)m n T n? ?  and any states ,i j I? ,  we label ( ) ( )nP P X j X iij m n m= = =+  as the nth step  transition probability of Markov Chain, and label ( ) ( )  [ ] n n  P Pij=  as the nth step transition matrix. The  Markov process forecasting model can be expressed as  follows: ( )( ) (0) nX n X P=  In the above formula, ( )X n  is the vector of state probability at the nth moment, (0)X is the vector of state probability at the initial moment and ( )nP  is the nth state transition matrix. If (0)X  and ( )nP  are known, we can use the above formula to forecast the states of any moment in the future.

4. Grey-markov forecasting model   Supposed (0) (0) (0) (0) (0){ (1), (2), (3), ..., ( )}X X X X X n= is the series of original data,  (0) (0) (0) (0) (0)? ? ? ? ?{ (1), (2), (3),..., ( )}X X X X X n=  is the series of fitting data, which is obtained through the GM (1, 1) model and the forecasting accuracy of which is qualified through check.

4.1. Establishing assessment indicator  We use the discrepancy between the series of original data and the series of fitting data as assessment indicator. The problem that the forecasting error is large, caused by the undulating original data in the GM (1, 1) model, can be well solved through making use of the fluctuation range between the original data and the fitting data and the probability of fluctuation developing trend. Therefore, firstly we calculate the series of residuals between the original data and the fitting data, that is  (0) (0) (0) (0) (0){ (1), (2), (3), ...., ( )}n? ? ? ? ?= , in which (0) (0) (0)?( ) ( ) ( ), 1, 2, 3, ...,k X k X k k n? = ? = . Then calculate  the mean value of residuals, that is (0)1 ( )  n k  n k ? ?= ?  = ,  and the mean square deviation of residuals, that  is (0) (0) 21( ) ( ( ) ) 1 1  n S k  n k ? ? ?= ??  ? = . Finally, calculate  the standardized deviation of residuals, that is (0) (0)( ) [ ( ) ] / ( )k k S? ? ? ?= ? , which is used to divide  states as the assessment indicator.

Supposed the standardized deviation of residuals  is subjected to the normal distribution and it can divide states according to the equal probability principle, then the number of ( )k?  constitutes the state transition matrix of Markov process.

4.2. Dividing states   According to the equal probability principle and  the size of ? , it can be divided into five states: (1)? + ,  when 1.645? ?  and the probability of which is 5%;  (2) ? , when 0.385 1.645?? < and the probability of  which is 30%; (3) ? , when 0.385 0.385?? ? < + and  the probability of which is 30%; (4) ? , when  1.645 0.385?? ? < ?  and the probability of which is  30%; (5) ? + , when 1.645? < ?  and the probability of  which is 5%.

4.3. Fixing state transition matrix   Assumed ( )M mij  is the number of original data     samples, which through m steps shift from state i  to state j , Mi  is the number of original data samples, which in the state of i , we label  ( ) ( ) ,  M mij p mij Mi  = , , , , , ,i j ? ? ? ? ?+ += as the mth state  transition probability and ( )P m as the mth state transition matrix, that is  ( ) ( ) ( )11 12 1 ( ) ( ) ( )21 22 2( )  ( ) ( ) ( )1 2  p m p m p mn p m p m p mnP m  p m p m p mnnn n  =  ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?? ?    ( )P m  reflects the transition law between any two  states, which is the foundation of the Grey-markov  forecasting model and can be used to forecast the  development trend of system.

4.4. Forecasting state vector   In actual application, it only requires the first  transition matrix. According to the theory of Markov  process, we can obtain the forecasting state vector,  which is ( ) (0) (1)nP n P P= . In the above formula,  ( )P n is the vector of state probability at the nth  moment, (0)P is the vector of state probability at the  initial moment and (1)P is the first state transition  matrix.

4.5. Forecasting result   Assumed (0)? ( )X n  is the forecasting result at the nth moment through GM (1, 1) model. On the basis of (0)? ( )X n , we can calculate the forecasting section of state i , and the forecasting value of state i  is the midpoint of the section, labeled as ? ( )iY n ,  , , , ,i ? ? ? ? ?+ += . Supposed ( )P n is the vector of state probability at the nth moment, the final forecasting  result is ? ?( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )T i i i  Y n Y n P n Y n p n ?  ?  +  +=  = ? = ??  5. Application of Grey-markov forecasting model   As is shown in Table 1, there is the historical order volume from the week of 1st to the 13rd in a distribution center. Now according to the order volume from the week of 1st to the 11th, we apply the Grey-markov model to forecast the order volume of the 12nd and 13rd week. Then we compare the forecasting results of GM (1, 1) model and Grey-markov model with the actual value.

Table 1   Historical order volume  Week 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Order volume 1346 1399 1467 1567 1595 1588 1622  Week 8 9 10 11 12 13 Order volume 1611 1615 1685 1789 1790 1829   5.1. Establishing GM (1, 1) model  Take the order volume from the week of 1st to 11th as samples to establish the GM (1, 1) model, which is  (0) 0.020302? ( 1) 1422.96 , 1, 2,kX k e k+ = ? = .

Through it, we can obtain the forecasting order volume of the 12nd and 13rd week, which is 1779 and 1816 respectively.

5.2. Calculating assessment indicator   The result of assessment indicator can be seen in Table 2.

Fixing state transition matrix   According to the calculation of assessment indicator and the division of states, we can get the states shift of order volume, which is shown in Table 3.

Table 3   States shift of order volume ?  ?  ?  ?  1 1 0 ?  1 1 2 ?  1 1 2   5.4. Forecasting state vector   According to Table 3, we can obtain the states transition matrix, which is  1/ 2 1/ 2 0 1/ 4 1/ 4 1/ 2 1/ 4 1/ 4 1/ 2  ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?? ?    Therefore, the state vectors of the 12nd and 13rd  week are [ ]1/ 2,1/ 2, 0 and [ ]3 / 8, 3 / 8,1/ 4 respectively.

5.5. Forecasting result   The forecasting results of the 12nd and 13rd week through Grey-markov model can be seen in Table 4.

Midpoint 1820 1779 1738 1856 1816 1775  Final result 1799 1821   As can be seen in Table 4, the forecasting  accuracy of Grey-markov model is better than GM (1, 1) model.

6. Conclusion   The GM (1, 1) model reflects the development  laws behind the disorderly surface of system. The Markov process model reflects the laws of system state and its transition. The grey-markov model has the advantages of the above two models, which achieves better effect in the practical application. Because the forecasting accuracy of the grey-markov model is related with the division of the markov state transition, which has no unified standard. This paper assumes the residual is subjected to the normal distribution and uses the standardized deviation of residuals as the state division standard. Therefore, there is further improvement to the grey-markov model.
