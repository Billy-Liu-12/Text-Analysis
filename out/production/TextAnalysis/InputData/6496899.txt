Abstract?The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) are jointly developing the next- generation series of Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES), known as the GOES-R Series.  GOES-R meteorological data is provided to the operational and science user community through four main distribution mechanisms.

GOES-R generates a set of data from each of the six primary satellite instruments and formats the data into a direct broadcast stream known as GOES Rebroadcast (GRB) for hemispheric distribution via L-band satellite downlink.

Terrestrially, meteorological data is provided to forecasters at the National Weather Service (NWS) through a direct interface to the Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS).  A secondary pathway for the user community to receive data terrestrially is via the GOES-R Access Subsystem (GAS), which is being developed as a part of NOAA?s Environmental Satellite Processing and Distribution System (ESPDS) Product Distribution and Access (PDA) capability.

Finally, GOES-R data is made available to NOAA?s Comprehensive Large Array-Data Stewardship System (CLASS) for long-term archive.

This paper will provide a summary description of the data types and formats associated with each of the four primary distribution pathways for user data from GOES-R.  It will discuss the resources that are being developed by GOES-R to document the data structures and formats.  It will also provide a brief introduction to the types of metadata associated with each of the primary data flows.
