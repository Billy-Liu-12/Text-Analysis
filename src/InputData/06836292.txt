Heterogeneous Spacecraft Networks: Performance  Analysis for Low-cost Earth Observation Missions

Abstract-Heterogeneous Spacecraft Networks (HSNs) are  network environments in which spacecraft from different  missions and institutions can communicate with each other at  low cost and with low impact on overall system resources. The  Mission Design Center (MDC) at NASA Ames Research  Center has been studying solutions for low cost multi?  spacecraft systems for a number of years. One may now build  on the idea to interconnect clusters of spacecraft with each  other to have them act as mobile nodes belonging to the same  collaborative mission. Recent progress in small satellite  technology is significant, and one of the advantages of small  satellites lies precisely in the large quantity of spacecraft that  can be produced at accessible costs. It follows naturally that  small satellites are an interesting candidate platform for  development and demonstration of the HSN concept. This  paper is the second in a series of three companion papers. The  general concept of operations for HSNs in LEO and a number  of future applications are proposed in the first paper [6], while  enabling technology such as devices and lower layer protocols  are discussed in paper three [7]. In this paper, we pick up the  scenario of a low-cost and multi-institutional network of Earth  Observation (EO) missions in LEO and conduct network  performance analysis using the AGI System Tool Kit (STK)  and the open-source Network Simulator (NS-3). A multi?  spacecraft network consolidates the individual capabilities of  each spacecraft from different institutions by combining  benefits of both frequent revisit and concentrated observation.

Complementary and correlated data could be collected  simultaneously from a large set of distributed spacecraft  utilizing HSN capability. In this specific configuration,  communication distance between spacecraft, related delays  and error rate are the major factors in network performance.

Also, average duration of communication opportunities  between spacecraft is usually very limited. Thus, it is  important to simulate orbital dynamics, link margins, and  protocols simultaneously to analyze network performances. In  this paper, we compare some existing protocols to obtain a  measure for the practical performance of the candidate  network. We focus on best-effort data delivery, an approach  necessitated by the severe constraints on communications  resulting from low-cost and low system resource small  spacecraft. In the application layer, we show that packet size  and data rate of a source node also affect overall performance  of the network. We present the resulting figures of merit from  our simulations. The paper concludes with a summary of the  simulation results.
