HeatWatch: Preventing Heatstroke

Abstract?In this paper, we present a novel application, HeatWatch, which predicts heatstroke and prevents heatstroke by ensuring users breaking and water intake. The application estimates user?s core temperature based on human thermal model and vital sensors equipped with smart watches. We also designed the application tracks user?s water intake by assuming to apply existing activity recognition technique to acceleration sensors inside a smart watch. We have discussed how to detect heatstroke sign and evaluated its performance through a real data set over 100 hours. Finally, the result showed that our method is able to instantly notify high temperature states with more than 0.9 recall and 0.53 precision by allowing early/late notification within 6 minutes.



I. INTRODUCTION  Heatstroke is a growing matter all over the world because of  global warming and heat wave. The major factor of heatstroke  is higher core temperature, however core temperature cannot  be measured during exercise because we have to measure  rectal temperature, tympanic temperature or esophagus tem-  perature that require invasive measurement to insert a probe.

To prevent heatstroke, World Health Organization (WHO)  provides health manuals for exercise in heat environment [1].

Besides, WBGT(Wet Bulb Globe Temperature) is widely used  as an index to evaluate a risk level of heat stroke [2]. However,  it is still insufficient to consider heterogeneous changes of core  temperature of individual subjects.

In our previous study [3], [4], we have proposed a method to  estimate core temperature based on a human thermal model, a  wearable sensor and environmental sensors. We also confirmed  our method successfully estimates core temperature with mean  absolute error 0.30 !n through over 100 hours of real exper-  iments including walking, running and tennis. Currently, we  are developing HeatWatch application to notify the individual  heatstroke warning based on a heatstroke risk index derived  from integration of core temperature rising and water intake  context estimated by wearable sensor measurement. There are  many studies of activity recognition in daily life by using  accelerometer, thus we employ these techniques and optimize  them to suit wrist-mounted sensors. As a first step to detect  core temperature rising, we have discussed and developed a  prototype of a heatstroke alerting system. An individual user  will receive heatstroke warning when his/her core temperature  exceeds a threshold. According to notification, users can  decrease their core temperature by taking a break and/or  ingesting enough water to avoid heatstroke.

Our contributions are summarized as below.

1) We proposed HeatWatch, a more effective approach  than observing just an environmental heat index such  as WBGT. It tracks user?s core temperature during  sports with a commercial-off-the-shelf smart watch for  heatstroke prevention.

2) We collected a real exercise data set over 100 hours  through 13 participants and analyzed it to determine an  appropriate threshold for notification.

3) Our prototype of a heatstroke alerting system showed  moderate precision and recall even for complicated  exercise data sets including walking, running and cycling  with interval breaks.

From the evaluation results, we confirmed that our method  successfully notifies high core temperature with 0.314 preci-  sion and 0.948 recall in cycling, 0.779 precision and 0.720  recall in running and walking. When we allowed 5-minute  error of notification, precision and recall rose to 0.514 and 1.0  in cycling, 0.965 and 0.899 in walking and running, which  shows the feasibility of HeatWatch.



II. RELATED WORKS  A. The Study of HeatStroke  In recent decades, heatstroke has received considerable  attention because of global warming and catastrophic heat  waves [5]. The mechanism of heatstroke is described in  [6], where core temperature rise is a fundamental factor. If  core temperature rises, cerebral, skin and gut blood flow  rate changes and they cause several symptoms. In summary,  monitoring core temperature is the most important task to  prevent heatstroke. In addition, reference [7] reports that all the  measured temperatures of heatstroke patients were over 39.5  !n. It also infers that ?over 39.5 !n core temperature? can be  regarded as a cause of heatstroke, however lower temperature  can be a positive diagnosis of heat stroke. Another major factor  of heatstroke is dehydration which makes the cardiovascular  system difficult to suppress rise of core temperature. A study  [8] revealed that core temperature rises 0.3 !n for every 1%  of fluid lost during exercise. Severe dehydration also causes a  failure of sweating, the most important heat emission function.

B. Heat Index for Preventing Heatstroke  For quantifying risk of heatstroke in daily life, WBGT, a  measure of the heat stress taking into account temperature,  humidity, wind speed and solar radiation is widely used [2].

According to WBGT, there are many guidelines for outdoor  The Third IEEE International Workshop on Sensing Systems and Applications Using Wrist Worn Smart Devices, 2017     TABLE I GUIDANCE FOR ATHLETIC TRAINERS [9]  WBGT(!n) Alert Level Recommendation  > 31 Stop Exercise No outdoor excercise > 28 Strict Warning Avoid hard exercise > 25 Warning Frequent breaks and water intake > 21 Attention Make sure water intake in the intervals < 21 None Usually safe  exercise. For example, Japanese Ministry of the Environment  introduces recommendations based on WBGT as shown in  Table I. However, many people work or participate in sports  during daytime even though many days in summer reach  higher or the highest alert level in subtropical and tropical  countries (e.g., Osaka, Japan observed 43 days with alert ?Stop  Exercise? or ?Strict Warning? (WBGT>28!n) in 2015). More-  over, environmental index cannot take individual difference of  response to heat environment and hard exercise into account.

For example, core temperature of a person is possible to reach  a dangerous level in spite of lower heat index if he/she is  not accustomed to heat environment. Therefore, monitoring  individual core temperature is an urgent task for preventing  heatstroke.

C. Heatstroke Sensing  There are some studies of heatstroke sensing. Reference [10]  proposes a sensor-equipped headgear to monitor in-hardhat  temperature. It shows relationship between temperature inside  headgear and core temperature. Nevertheless, the system can  be applied to limited sports which require headgears. In  contrast, our approach uses only a smart watch which can  be used in many sports. Several studies proposed heatstroke  alert applications for smartphones [11]. They are suitable for  almost all situations. However, they depend on temperature  and humidity measured by smartphones, thus it does not solve  the problem of the environmental heat index described in  Section II-B.

Another study [12] proposes a wearable shirt with integrated  e-textiles to prevent heatstroke for firefighters. It integrates  heartrate with the air temperature and humidity. It is also  suitable for various situations, however our advantage is direct  estimation of core temperature. Our approach can achieve  more accurate estimation because core temperature rise is the  key factor of heatstroke.

There are also some sensors which can accurately measure  core temperature. CorTemp1 is a wireless ingestible thermome-  ter to measure core temperature intracorporeally. However,  we must dispose of the thermometer after each measurement  and the receiver is expensive, thus it leads to a considerable  cost. 3M SpotOn System2 can also indirectly measure core  temperature by a probe attached on a forehead, although it is  not appropriate to exercise since it requires a wired control  unit.

III. APPLICATION DESIGN  A. Overview  As a straightforward approach to prevent heatstroke, we  propose HeatWatch which directly estimates core temperature  and alerts when user?s core temperature reaches a higher  level. In our previous study [3], [4], we have proposed a  core temperature estimation method based on integration of  a human thermal model called Gagge?s two node model and  wearable and environmental sensors. We have also proposed  an individual-parameter optimization method which is appli-  cable during exercise for more accurate estimation. The result  of real experiment through over 100 hours of walking, running  and tennis shows that our method successfully estimates core  temperature with mean absolute error less than 0.30 !n.The  detail of our method is briefly summarized in section IV. In  this paper, we use our method proposed in [4] for core tem-  perature estimation. In addition, we have designed HeatWatch  considering water intake which is another important factor for  preventing dehydration by employing existing works such as  [13] for drinking activity recognition. Our final goal is to  combine rise of core temperature and water intake context  for deriving a heatstroke risk index, and to notify each player  when his/her index exceeds a threshold.

In this paper, we discuss a fundamental indicator using  rise of core temperature. We also briefly describe a core  temperature estimation method in section IV and discuss a  fundamental indicator through evaluation by real data sets in  section V.

B. System Architecture  The architecture of HeatWatch is shown in Figure 1. The  overall platform consists of three devices: (1) a smart watch to  measure subject?s heartrate, skin temperature and acceleration  continuously, (2) an environmental sensor deployed in the  exercise field to measure the ambient air temperature and  humidity and (3) a smartphone which receives and processes  sensor measurement via wireless communication (e.g., Blue-  tooth).

HeatWatch inputs measured heartrate, skin temperature, air  temperature and humidity into the two node model to simulate  core temperature. In the simulation process, the two node  model calculates user?s core and skin temperature at time t  based on both the temperatures at time t? 1 and sensor input  collected at time t. By repeating time-sequential calculation,  the model obtains sequences of skin and core temperatures.

Now we intend to combine user?s water intake context with  estimated core temperature. During ?drink water? activities,  people usually raise their arm and keep high place for water  ingestion. Therefore, we consider ?drink? estimation is easily  carried out by a simple algorithm because ?drink? act may  show abnormal acceleration of earth gravity for each axis and  lower variance for acceleration and gyroscope.

After that, HeatWatch combines estimated core temperature  and context of water intake into one indicator (i.e. heatstroke  index). Based on this indicator, HeatWatch notifies heatstroke  The Third IEEE International Workshop on Sensing Systems and Applications Using Wrist Worn Smart Devices, 2017    DATA ACQUISITION!

C. Requirement  HeatWatch requires a user to wear a smart watch to measure  his/her skin temperature and heartrate for core temperature  estimation. We also have to input environmental information  (i.e. temperature and humidity) into the core temperature  estimation algorithm. Both of the sensors should be able to  connect to a smartphone via wireless communication. For  a smart watch, we use Microsoft Band3 which can mea-  sure heartrate, skin temperature and acceleration. There are  a few programmable environmental sensors which measure  air temperature and humidity, however it is easy to develop  an environmental sensor with a wireless capability by using  a sensor platform such as Arduino4. The core temperature  estimation algorithm also requires initial core temperature for  each subject, thus we measure actual core temperature by  using an infrared tympanic thermometer such as OMRON  Gentle Temp 5105 before starting exercise. Measured core  temperature is manually given to HeatWatch application.

The method estimates core temperature based on thermal  simulation using Gagge?s two node model [14]. Two node  model approximates a human body as a sphere composed of  the skin layer and the core layer as shown in Figure 2. For  temperature simulation, the model repeats calculation of the  heat transferred between the skin layer, the core layer and  the ambient air per unit time. To start simulation, we input  initial skin temperature and initial core temperature. We also  manually input subject?s information: height, weight, resting  heartrate, maximum heartrate, clothing insulation and an ex-  ercise type. After that, we continuously measure heartrate, the  ambient air temperature and humidity to calculate the heat  exchange per unit time. We convert heartrate into metabolism  according to maximum heartrate and resting heartrate.

In the core layer, some amount of heat is always pro-  duced by metabolism. Then, some of the metabolic energy  is consumed by exercise and the rest is transformed to heat  energy. The heat is transferred to the skin layer by blood  flow and direct conduction and emitted to the ambient air by  respiration. The skin layer receives the heat transferred from  the core layer, then the layer emits the heat by water diffusion,  perspiration, radiation and convection on the skin surface. For  details, readers may refer to reference [3].

In the two node model, sweating and blood flow increase,  that are the most important mechanisms for thermoregulation,  are calculated based on rise amount of core and skin tem-  perature compared to their initial values. This means both of  sweat production rate and blood flow increase rate depend on  core and skin temperature rising. For more accurate core tem-  perature simulation, four parameters representing individual  difference of sweating and blood flow increase are proposed  in [15]. Moreover, our study [4] proposes additional two pa-  rameters to consider the delay of human thermal response. We  optimize these six parameters by applying a fitting algorithm  to a few samples of core temperatures measured during breaks.

We have evaluated the method through over 100 hours of  real experiments of walking, running and tennis. From the  result, we have confirmed mean absolute error is less than  0.30 !n. In the next section, we discuss heatstroke warning  based on this method.

V. DISCUSSION AND EVALUATION  A. Dataset  In our previous study, we collected two real datasets through  (1) ergometer exercise and (2) running and walking. Tables II  and III summarize each experiment. In ergometer exercise,  we collected over 40 hours data from seven participants and  the exercise intensity changed between 2.4[W] and 7.2[W]  every five minutes. We note that the ergometer data set does  not include breaks but it includes core temperature changes  due to exercise intensity change. In the running and walking  experiment, we collected over 60 hours data from six subjects  in heat environment. They could choose either running (4 runs  + 3 breaks) or walking (3 walks + 2 breaks) according to their  conditions. Note that these datasets include interval breaks  between runs or walks. In the following evaluation, we analyze  the difference between cycling, running and walking.

Heatstroke Warning Algorithm  According to [7], core temperature more than 39.5 !n  is a reliable indicator for heatstroke. However, our goal is  not detecting heatstroke patients but preventing users from  heatstroke. Thus, we initially analyze core temperatures in  Measured Core Temperature [?]!

Figures 3 and 4 show the core temperature  distributions of ergometer exercise and running and walking  exercise, respectively. In the ergometer exercise, only 2.2%  of all the samples are greater than 38.0 !n. Also, in the  running and walking exercise, 11.9% of all the samples exceed  38.0 !n. According to this result and World Meteorological  Organization (WMO) recommendation for outdoor workers  [16], we set a threshold for heatstroke warning to 38.0 !n.

We note that this threshold should be optimized based on  the feedback from users (e.g., a higher threshold may be  suitable for well-trained athletes). In the following sections,  we evaluate precision and recall of heatstroke warning that  arises when the core temperature exceeds 38.0 !n.

We show classification result for both  the datasets in Table IV and V where the rows mean show  the number of warnings produced by our algorithm and the  columns show the number of true warnings. We note that the  numbers on the tables are the total time duration in minutes  when core temperature is 38.0 !n or greater / less than 38.0  !n. Table IV shows core temperature in the ergometer data set  is over the threshold for only 58 out of 2652 minutes. This is  because the room temperature was not so high (< 30?C) and  there was no solar radiation which constantly heats up human  body in outdoor. The result represents our prototype system  can alert with very high recall (0.948 = 55/58), however the  precision is still low (0.314 = 55/175). The reason for low  precision is that our method tends to estimate core temperature  higher than the actual temperature. Actually, there are data  occur 81 false positives where estimated core temperature is  much higher than the actual temperature.

Fig. 5. An Example of Core Temperature Estimation  Table V shows the result of running and walking datasets,  where precision and recall are 0.779 (=311/399) and 0.720  (=311/432). Although our method achieves moderate perfor-  mance, our application requires higher recall for human safety.

The major reason of low recall is core temperature estimation  error up to 0.30 !n. Another reason is the fact that there are  some subjects whose actual core temperature exceeds 38.0  !n for only a few minutes. In that case, correct notification  becomes more difficult due to estimation error. We consider  exceeding the threshold for a moment is not so dangerous, thus  we ignore the samples such that temperature once exceeds 38.0  !n and returns to under the threshold within five minutes. As  a result, we removed 20 false negative samples in Table V.

Figure 5 is an example of core temperature estimation and  heatstroke alert. It shows core temperature estimation is still  challenging, namely reproducing actual response is a difficult  task. On the other hand, the estimation result is useful for  detecting whether the temperature reaches 38.0?C or not. In  this case, our algorithm can correctly alert it with a few false  positives.

D. Result with acceptable error ?T  We consider some error of timing should be acceptable  because core temperature estimation is still difficult by limited  sensors and we assume the threshold must be much lower than  39.5 !n (dangerous level) for safety. Therefore, we introduce  acceptable error ?T and evaluate precision and recall while  changing the range of ?T . For example, ?T = 3 means that  we regard warnings which error of warning timing within three  minutes as correct. Figure 6 depicts the relationship between  precision, recall and acceptable error ?T for the ergometer  data set. If no error is accepted (?T = 0), precision is 0.314  and recall is 0.948 as described in the previous result. On the  other hand, precision gradually improves over 0.5 and recall  reaches 1.0 even with ?T = 5. Finally, we confirmed 0.589  precision and 1.0 recall when we allowed 10-minute error of  alert timing (?T = 10). Precision is still challenging, however  we believe that we can improve accuracy of notification  by considering continuous alerts (i.e. raise warning in the  case that the algorithm continuously detects high temperature)  because our current algorithm detects high-core temperature  at that moment.

Fig. 6. Precision and Recall with ?T  The upper row on Figure 7 depicts the overall result for the  running and walking datasets. In each figure, precision and  recall rise with the increase of ?T . We also found notification  in running is still challenging compared to walking since  precision is high while recall is low, which means estimated  core temperature tends to be lower than the actual temperature.

This is because reproducing human body response in compli-  cated exercise is difficult. Nevertheless, precision and recall in  running improve with the increase of ?T and exceeds 0.9 with  ?T = 8. This indicates our method is helpful for detecting  core temperature rise over the threshold. However, there are  still some false negatives which seriously drop reliability.

To solve this problem, we add some offset to the estimated  core temperature for safer warning. Adding offset decreases  precision (i.e. increase of false alarms), however false positives  are much better than false negatives.

The lower row on Figure 7 represents precision and recall  after we added 0.1 !n as a minimum offset to estimated core  temperature. The result shows recall of both the exercises  exceeds over 0.74 even in the case that no error is accepted  (?T = 0). Although precision decreases compared to the  results without the offset, it is still high (> 0.8) if we allow 2-  minute error of notification timing. Overall recall increases by  adding 0.1?C offset and reached 0.984 with ?T = 10. This  means 1.6% false negatives is still undetected. Nevertheless, all  the false negatives occurred in one experiment case. The false  negatives are observed just before finishing the experiment  due to sudden rise of core temperature. If we could continue  the experiment, our method can possibly alert heatstroke.

As a consequence, it is better to estimate core temperature  with some offset for safety although we have to accept some  false alarms. However, precision is still higher than 0.9 with  ?T = 6.

The results have revealed our method can instantly detect  high temperature exceeding 38.0 !nwith over 0.7 recall. The  result also showed precision and recall dramatically increase  when we accept some error of warning timing. In the fu-  ture, we are planning to develop HeatWatch with a real-  time warning algorithm and drinking activity recognition. To  detect drinking activities, we intend to employ acceleration  and gyroscope equipped with a smart watch and make an  activity recognition model based on the features such as  difference of gravity for each sensor axis and variance for  acceleration and gyroscope. We are also planning to validate  the appropriateness of alarms based on the users? feedback  through real experiments.
