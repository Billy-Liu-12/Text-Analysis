A Simple Approach of Data Mining in Excel

Abstract?Data mining is a new method of data analysis,  especially very large datasets analysis. Nowadays it is becoming  more and more popular in data handling. It is a rapidly growing  field, whose development is driven by strong research interests as  well as urgent practical, social, and economical needs. However,  it generally requires much specialty knowledge. It is not easy for  people without specialty knowledge to handle very large datasets  with data mining. This paper describes an approach of data  mining with Excel using the XLMiner add-in. Using this  approach, data preparation can be easily accomplished in Excel.

Almost every one can use Excel experienced. Therefore, data  mining in Excel can be implemented easily, not only by people  with specialty knowledge but also by people without specialty  knowledge. This paper presents an example of mining association rules to illustrate all the steps of this approach.

I. INTRODUCTION  This section presents some background information about data mining, association rule, Excel and XLMiner.

1.1 Data mining  With the progress of humanity society and the development of technique, our capabilities of both generating and collecting data have been increasing rapidly. The widespread use of bar codes for most commercial products, the computerization of many business and government transactions, and the advances in data collection tools have provided us with huge amounts of data. Millions of databases have been used in business management, scientific and engineering data management, and many other applications. It is noted that the number of such databases keeps growing rapidly because of the availability of powerful and affordable database systems. This explosive growth in data and databases has generated an urgent need for new techniques and tools that can intelligently and automatically turn the processed data into useful information and knowledge. Consequently, data mining has emerged and become a research area with increasing importance[1].

Data mining is the analysis of (often large) observational data sets to find unsuspected relationships and to summarize the data in novel ways that are both understandable and useful to the data owner[2]. Data mining have many alias, such as knowledge discovery in database(KDD), knowledge extraction,  patter discovery, data/pattern analysis, data archaeology, and data dredging [3].

Data mining has been recognized by many researchers as a key research topic in data handling, and by many industrial companies as an important area with an opportunity of major revenues. Researchers in many different fields have shown great interest in data mining. Several emerging applications in information providing services, such as data warehousing and on-line services over the Internet, also call for various data mining techniques to better understand user behavior, to improve the service provided, and to increase the business opportunities.

Data mining is not limited to business[4]. Both major parties in the 2004 U.S. election utilized data mining of potential voters[5]. Data mining has been heavily used in the medical field, to include diagnosis of patient records to help identify best practices[6]. The Mayo Clinic worked with IBM to develop an online computer system to identify how that last 100 Mayo patients with the same age, gender and medical history had responded to particular treatments[7].

1.2 Association rule  Association rule mining is a pioneer of data mining and one of the most active point of data mining[8]. It reveals attribute value conditions that occur frequently together in a given dataset. A typical and widely-used example of association rule mining is Market Basket Analysis.

Association rule is defined in the form of ?if-then? statement, where the ?if? part and ?then? part are respectively called antecedent and consequent. For example, if buy milk then buy bread. It can be used for adjusting store layouts(placing items optimally with respect to each other), for cross-selling, for promotions, for catalog design, and to identify customer segments based on buying patterns. These rules are computed from the data, which is unlike the if-then rules of logic. The association rules are probabilistic in nature.

?Support? and ?Confidence? are two important numbers used to express the degree of uncertainty about the rule.

The Support is simply the number of transactions that include all items in the antecedent and consequent parts of the rule. (The Support is sometimes expressed as a percentage of the total number of records in the database.)  Confidence is the     ratio of the Support to the number of transactions that include all items in the antecedent.

For example, if a market database has 10,000 point-of-sale transactions, out of which 200 include both items A and B and 80 of these include item C, the association rule "If A and B are purchased then C is purchased on the same trip" has a support of 80 transactions (alternatively 0.8%=80/10,000) and a confidence of 40% (=80/2000).

Lift is one more parameter of interest in the association rules mining. Lift is nothing but the ratio of Confidence to Expected Confidence. Expected Confidence in this case means, using the above example, "confidence, if buying A and B does not enhance the probability of buying C." It is the number of transactions that include the consequent divided by the total number of transactions. Suppose the number of total number of transactions for C is 500. Thus Expected Confidence is 500/10,000=5%. For our supermarket example the Lift = Confidence/Expected Confidence = 40%/5% = 8. Hence Lift is a value that gives us information about the increase in probability of the "then" (consequent) given the "if" (antecedent) part[9].

1.3 Excel  Excel is part of the Microsoft Office suite. It is a spreadsheet program that can organize data into lists and then summarize, compare, and present data graphically. Excel?s forte is performing numerical calculations. Excel is also very useful for non-numerical applications [10].

Excel can find the sum, average, or maximum value of given dataset; create a graph showing what percentage of sales were in a particular range; and show how the total sales compared with the total sales of other days in the same week.

Shortly, Excel saves us from having to create these summaries by hand [11].

Recently, Excel has been used by researchers and managers as an efficient tool of data management and data analysis, and has become quite indispensable.

1.4 XLMiner  XLMiner is a comprehensive data mining add-in for Excel, developed by Cytel Software Corporation (markers of StatXact, LogXact and Egret) and Distributed by Resampling Stats, Inc[9].

It is a toolkit which helps users get quickly started with data mining, offering a variety of analysis methods for large datasets.

It has extensive coverage of statistical and machine learning techniques for classification, prediction, affinity analysis (association rule mining) and data exploration and reduction.

It is not free, but a free 30-day trial demo edition is available free from www.xlminer.com or www.resampling.com[9, 12].

The first step in using XLMiner is to install it on computer.

Once installed, it can be registered in Excel as an add-in and then appears as a new option in the menu bar as shown in Fig.1.

Generally speaking, the major focus of data mining is on efficient algorithms. Even though there are many data mining software products, such as Clementine and SAS[13], but most are difficult to use for general people. This paper emphasizes on the application and describes a very simple approach of data mining in Excel with XLMiner. This approach can be mastered by every one, whether specialist or general user. The following sections illustrate in detail process of data mining in Excel with XLMiner, using an example of association rule mining.



II. DATA PREPARATION  Data preparation is a fundamental stage of data analysis.

The object of data preparation is to get data ready for the analysis algorithm. This section details the general process of data preparing. This paper divides preparing data into following parts:  2.1 Data choosing  As dataset is the object of mining, the first step of data preparation is certainly to choose a mining dataset.

From this point on, a market sales dataset will be mined in this paper. They are about customers buying fruit-vegetable, canned vegetables, fresh meat, canned meat, fish, dairy, frozen food, beer, wine, soft drinks, and confectionary.

2.2 Data organizing  After confirming which dataset to be mined, the next step is to organize them. Nowadays, large scale data are often organized and stored in databases, or at least in spreadsheets by their owners.

Fig.2(a) shows the datasets in this paper, which are organized in Excel and stored as a spreadsheet.

In this figure, T or F in the column fruit-vegetable marks whether the corresponding customer bought or didn?t buy fruit- vegetable. The other columns also follow this rule.

2.3 Data preprocessing  The organized dataset is often incomplete, noisy, inconsistent. This is known as raw data. It usually does not meet data mining requirements. Therefore, the dataset has to be preprocessed.

Data preprocessing describes any type of processing performed on raw data to prepare it for data handling.

Commonly used as a preliminary data mining practice, data preprocessing transforms the data into a format that will be more easily and effectively processed for the purpose of the user, for example, using the mining association rule. A number     Figure 2 (a)  Market sales data organized in Excel  of different tools and methods used for preprocessing, including: sampling, which selects a representative subset from a large population of data; transformation, which manipulates raw data to produce a single input; denoising, which removes noise from data; normalization, which organizes data for more efficient access; and feature extraction, which pulls out specified data that is significant in some particular context[14].

XLMiner provides several tools of data preprocessing, such as sampling, missing data handling, binning continuous data and transforming categorical data. The whole process can be completed within Excel.

For simplicity, dataset in this paper is complete and non- noisy. For mining association rules, it is only necessary to change F to 0 and T to 1. Fig.2(b) shows the transformed dataset.



III. DATA MINING  Data mining is the core step of this paper. This section illustrates, with an example, the whole process of data mining in Excel with XLMiner.

3.1 Data access  XLMiner can access data from a database or worksheet of Excel, as shown in Fig.3 and Fig.4.

In the example of this paper, XLMiner accesses dataset from a worksheet in Excel, as shown in Fig.4.

Mining association rules only need settings for minimum support and minimum confidence. In this example, these values are set as 0.20 and 0.80, as shown in Fig.4.

IV. SUMMARY  This paper introduces some basic concepts of data mining  and points out the major researchers focus on efficient mining  algorithm. Data mining is not easy to implement for those  without lot specialty knowledge of data mining. This paper  presented an easy-to-complete data mining solution for any  one skilled in Excel with an add-in for Excel, XLMiner. Using  this approach, the entire data preparation process can be  completed using only Excel. In the mining process, only a few  parameters (usually two) need to be set manually. In spite of  the simplicity, the results are very understandable. Association  rules mining was used as an example of data mining in this  paper. This approach makes data mining easy, not only for  people with specialized knowledge, but also for people with  general skills.
