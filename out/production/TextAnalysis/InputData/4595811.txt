Granular Association Analysis

Abstract? The topic of fuzzy information granulation was first proposed by Zadeh in 1979. There has been a fast increasing interest in this topic and its applications since in many situations, when a problem involves incomplete, vague or uncertain infor- mation, it is difficult to come to a crisp solution and requires a granular solution which has a very significant impact on the design and implementation of intelligent systems. Care is needed when information systems use fuzzy sets to model graded membership in granules - the fuzzy sets are not disjunctive possibility distributions, but must be interpreted conjunctively.

This distinction is clarified theoretically in this paper and it is shown how an extended mass assignment framework can be used to extract relations between granules. These relations are association rules and are useful when integrating multiple infor- mation sources. Experimental results on film genres, commercial database and terrorism incident databases carried out in the SQuAD project are demonstrated and discussed in this paper.



I. INTRODUCTION  The initiative of UK Ministry of Defence in ?network  enabled capability? (NEC) can be loosely summarised as  ?right information, right place, right time - and not too  much?. A core requirement for NEC is ?active intelligence?  which requires the improved sharing and interoperability of  Intelligence and security information ?through a resilient in-  formation infrastructure? which requires ?more flexible (infor-  mation) acquisition precesses? across different organisations  that have different views at different abstract levels about the  information.

We identify that information granulation [1] - inspired by  the ways in which humans granulate information and reason  with it - plays an important part to achieve NEC vision. It is  natural to notice that humans process information on different  levels of abstraction or perception. For example, the category  of vintage wine has a different (but objective) definition,  depending on the country of origin. To a purist, vintage wines  are made from grapes harvested in a single year however, the  European Union allows up to 5% of the grapes to be harvested  in a different year, the USA allows 15% in some cases and  5% in others, while other countries such as Chile and South  Africa may allow up to 25%.

Noticeably, information systems model the world in some  way, and need to represent categories which correspond to  the loosely defined classes used by humans in natural lan-  guage. For example, a company may wish to divide adults  into customers and non-customers, and then sub-divide these  into high-value customers, dissatisfied customers, potential  customers, etc. Such categories are not necessarily distinct  (i.e. they may be a covering rather than a partition) but  more importantly, membership in these categories is graded  - customer S may be highly dissatisfied and about to find a new supplier whilst customer T is only mildly dissatisfied.

The use of graded membership (fuzziness) in categories thus  enhances their expressive power and usefulness.

The use of fuzzy sets in these information systems has  drawn increasing interests, especially in the association analy-  sis research [2], [3], [4]. The goal of association analysis is to  search for interesting association or correlation relationships  among a large set of data items in a given data set. That  is, to find the implication from the antecedent X to the consequent Y , in the form of X ? Y , where X ,Y ? I (I = {i1, i2, ..., in} represents the item universe) and X ?Y = ?. In the crisp setting, a single item can be represented in terms of a binary (0/1-valued, true or false) attribute reflecting  the presence or absence of the item in the antecedent or  consequent. In the fuzzy case, the Boolean predicates X and Y are replaced by the corresponding fuzzy predicates in which the truth values are in the interval [0, 1]. Care is needed when information systems use fuzzy sets to model  graded membership in granules - the fuzzy item sets are not  disjunctive possibility distributions, but must be interpreted  conjunctively [18]. To make association analysis applicable to  data sets involving this characteristic, a further extension to  the current methods is needed.

The remainder of the paper is organised as follows: Section  II discusses several aspects relating to fuzzy sets in the  information systems. Section III proposes a new mass-based  association analysis method to calculate the degree of associa-  tion between two granules. Section IV shows some interesting  results by applying the proposed association analysis method.

Section V concludes the paper and outlines the future work.



II. FUZZY RELATION  Many authors [8], [9] have proposed the use of fuzzy sets  to model uncertain values in databases and other knowledge  based applications. The standard interpretation of a fuzzy set  in this context is as a possibility distribution - that is to say it  represents a single valued attribute which is not known exactly.

For example we might use the fuzzy set tall to represent the  Bio-inspired, learning and intelligent systems for security  DOI 10.1109/BLISS.2008.12   Bio-inspired, Learning and Intelligent Systems for Security  DOI 10.1109/BLISS.2008.12     height of a specific person or low to represent the value shown on a dice. The fuzzy sets tall and low admit a range of values, to a greater or lesser degree; the actual value is taken from  the range. Knowing that a dice value val is even restricts the possible values to val=2 XOR val=4 XOR val=6, where  XOR is an ?exclusive or?. If a fuzzy set on the same universe is defined as small = {1/1, 2/0.9, 3/0.4} then knowing the value val is small restricts the possible values to val=1 XOR val=2 XOR val=3 with corresponding memberships.

The conjunctive interpretation of a fuzzy set occurs when  the attribute can have multiple values. For example, a person  may be able to speak several languages; we could model this  as a fuzzy set of languages, where membership would depend  on the degree of fluency. This is formally a relation rather than a function on the underlying sets. Our position is to make  a distinction between the conjunctive interpretation - modelled  by a fuzzy relation - and the disjunctive interpretation -  modelled by a possibility distribution. For example, a person  may be able to speak several languages; we could model this as  a fuzzy set of languages, where membership would depend on  the degree of fluency. Note that there are multiple values that  satisfy this predicate to a greater or lesser degree in contrast  to one possible value in disjunctive cases, e.g. tall and low shown above.

We define a relation as a conjunctive set of ordered n- tuples i.e. it represents a conjunction of n ground clauses. For example, if U is the set of dice scores then we could define a predicate differBy4or5 on U ? U as the set of pairs  [(1, 6), (1, 5), (2, 6), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2)]  This is a conjunctive set in that each pair satisfies the predicate.

In a similar way, a fuzzy relation represents a set of n- tuples that satisfy a predicate to a specified degree. Thus  differByLargeAmount could be represented by  [(1, 6)/1, (1, 5)/0.6, (2, 6)/0.6, (5, 1)/0.6, (6, 1)/1, (6, 2)/0.6]  To emphasise the distinction, we use the notation  R = [x/?(x)|x ? U ]  to denote a multi-valued attribute (relation). Granules represent  the latter case, since we have multiple values that satisfy the  predicate to a greater or lesser degree.



III. GRANULE ASSOCIATION ANALYSIS  Granules provide a convenient way to describe a finite set  of objects by specifying certain selection criteria. Once the  granules are constructed, one may be interested in developing  computational methods to study the relationships among these  granules. In particular, we are interested in the association  analysis.

A. Association Rules  Association rule mining [10] was first proposed to mine  rules from transaction databases. The aim of association rule  mining is to determine whether or not there are links between  two disjoint subsets of items for example, do customers  generally buy biscuits and cheese when beer, lager and wine  are bought.

Formally, let I = {i1, i2, ..., in} be a set of items and T = {t1, t2, ..., tm} be a set of transactions. Notice that any transaction can be represented as ti ? I. Let x and y be two non-overlapping subsets of I, X and Y be two sets of transactions containing items x and y respectively. The goal of association analysis is to search for interesting association  or correlation relationships between X and Y . That is, if the items in x appear in a transaction, it is likely that the items in y will also appear i.e. it is not an implication in the formal logical sense.

There are two useful measures for the association analysis;  support and confidence. The support of a rule is the fraction  of transactions in which both X and Y appear, and the confidence of a rule is an estimate (based on the samples) of  the conditional probability of Y given X . The mathematical definitions are given below.

Supp(X ,Y) = |X ? Y|  |T | (1)  Conf(X ,Y) = |X ? Y|  |X | (2)  Typically association rule mining algorithms discover all item  associations (or rules) in the data that satisfy the user-  specified minimum support (minsup) and minimum confidence  (minconf) constraints. Minsup controls the minimum number  of data cases that a rule must cover. Minconf controls the  predictive strength of the rule. A association rule is correct if  it satisfies these two parameters.

Fuzzy association analysis has been intensively studied in  recent years [11], [12], [13], [14]. The standard extension to  the fuzzy case is to treat the (multi-) sets X , Y as fuzzy and find the intersection and cardinality using a t-norm and sigma- count respectively. The confidence Equation (2) is transformed  into  Conf(X ,Y) =  ?  i?I  ?X?Y(i)  ?  i?I  ?X (i) (3)  where ? refers to the monadic fuzzy membership function.

Using min and the sigma count for cardinality can be un-  satisfactory [12] because it does not distinguish between  several tuples with low memberships and few tuples with high  memberships. For example, given  X = [i1/0.01, i2/0.01, ..., ii/1, ..., i1000/0.01]  Y = [i1/0.01, i2/0.01, ..., ij/1, ..., i1000/0.01]  where i 6= j. We get,  Conf(X ,Y) = 1000? 0.01  1 + 999 ? 0.01 ? 0.91 (4)     As we can observe, this value is extremely high for two  almost disjoint sets. By using the method proposed in [14],  a reasonable confidence value 0.01 can be obtained.

In the granule setting we allow partial membership. For  example, instead of looking for an association between potato  crisps and beer, we might look for an association between  snack foods and alcoholic drinks. It is important to note  that we are dealing with conjunctive fuzzy sets (monadic  fuzzy relations) here. Mass assignment theory is normally  applied to fuzzy sets representing possibility distributions and  the operation of finding the conditional probability of one  fuzzy sets given another is known as semantic unification  [15]. This rests on the underlying assumption of a single  valued attribute. A different approach is required to find the  conditional probability when we are dealing with set-valued  attributes. In the rest of the section we propose an extension  of the theory to computing the association between granules.

B. Granule Association Analysis: Mass-based Approach  The core of information granulation [5] is that information  can be processed on different levels of abstraction in which  data objects are organised into meaningful granules 1 so as to  convey a perception of information itself. Thus, it is necessary  to study the criteria for deciding how ?a clump of points  (objects) are drawn together by indistinguishability, similarity,  proximity or functionality [5]?. In this paper, we assume that  the entities (instances) that are being categorised are known  unambiguously. When integrating multiple sources, this is  often not the case and have outlined SOFT (the Structured  Object Fusion Toolkit) elsewhere [7] as one solution to this  problem.

We consider two granules, represented as monadic fuzzy re-  lations X and Y on the same domain, and wish to calculate the degree of association between them. For example, consider a  database of sales employees, salaries and sales figures. We can  categorise employees according to whether their commissions  are high, medium or low and also according to whether their sales figures are good, moderate or poor. A mining task might be finding out whether the good sales figures are achieved by offering high commission fees. Given the Table I  TABLE I  SALES V.S. COMMISSION FEE  name sales commission  a 4,000 10%  b 3,200 4%  c 2,000 8%  d 800 7%  suppose we have source granule as good sales figures (X ) and target granule as high commission fee (Y), by defining the monadic fuzzy relations  X = [a/1, b/0.8, c/0.5, d/0.2]  1A fuzzy subset of the universe corresponds to a granule in this paper.

and  Y = [a/1, b/0.4, c/0.8, d/0.7]  It is important to note that these represent sets of values that  all satisfy the related granule to a degree. Unless explicitly  mentioned, all the sets in the rest of the section shall be  interpreted as conjunctive relations. The confidence in an  association rule in such setting can be calculated as follows.

Without loss of generality, we explain the operations on the  source granule. For a source granule, we have  X = [x1/?X(x1), x2/?X(x2), ..., x|X |/?X(x|X |)]  we can define the corresponding mass assignment [15] for the  source granule as follows. Let the set of distinct memberships  in X be {?  (1) X , ?  (2) X , ..., ?  (nX) X }  where  ? (1) X > ?  (2) X > ... > ?  (nX ) X  and nX ? |X |.

Let  X1 = {[x|?X(x) = ? (1) X ]}  and  Xi = {[x|?X(x) ? ? (i) X ]} ? Xi?1, 1 < i ? nX  then the mass assignment corresponding to X is  {Xi : mX(Xi)}, 1 ? i ? nX  where  mX(Xk) = ? (k) X ? ?  (k+1) X (?  (i) X = 0 if i > nX)  For example, given source granule  X = [a/1, b/0.8, c/0.5, d/0.2]  it has the corresponding mass assignment  MX = {{[a]} : 0.2, {[a], [a, b]} : 0.3,  {[a], [a, b], [a, b, c]} : 0.3,  {[a], [a, b], [a, b, c], [a, b, c, d]} : 0.2}  We can now calculate the confidence in the association  between the granules X and Y using mass assignment theory.

In general, this will be an interval as we are free to move mass  (consistently) between elements of each Xi and Yj .

For two mass assignments,  MX = {{Xpi} : mX(Xi)}, 1 ? pi ? i ? nX  and  MY = {{Yqj} : mY (Yi)}, 1 ? qj ? j ? nY  the composite mass assignment is  MC = MX ?  MY = {S : mC(S)}  where mC is the composite mass allocation function C(i, j,Xpi ,Yqj ) subject to     nY?  j=1  ?  1?qj?j 1?pi?i  C(i, j,Xpi ,Yqj ) = mX(Xi)  nX?  i=1  ?  1?qj?j 1?pi?i  C(i, j,Xpi ,Yqj ) = mY (Yi)  We can get  Conf(X ,Y) =  nX?  i=1  nY?  j=1  ?  1?qj?j 1?pi?i  C(i, j,Xpi ,Yqj ) ? |Xpi ? Yqj |  nX?  i=1  nY?  j=1  ?  1?qj?j 1?pi?i  C(i, j,Xpi ,Yqj ) ? |Xpi |  (5)  In general there can be considerable computation involved in  finding the maximum and minimum confidences for a rule.

When ranking association rules it is preferable to have a single  figure for confidence, rather than an interval which can lead  to ambiguity in the ordering.

The mass assignment corresponds to a distribution on the  power set of relations, and we can define the least prejudiced  distribution in the same way as for the standard mass assign-  ment. In the example above, we get the LPD of the source  granule  LPDX = {[a] : 0.5, [a, b] : 0.3, [a, b, c] : 0.15, [a, b, c, d] : 0.05}  and the LPD of the target granule  LPDY = {[a] : 0.45, [a, c] : 0.25, [a, c, d] : 0.2, [a, b, c, d] : 0.1}  We can redistribute the mass according to the least prej-  udiced distribution i.e. split the mass in each row (column)  equally between its sub-rows (sub-columns) and taking the  product as the mass in each cell. In this case, we get the  confidence as,  Conf(X ,Y) =  nX?  i=1  nY?  j=1  LPDX(Xi) ? LPDY (Yj) ? |Xi ? Yj |  nX?  i=1  LPDX(Xi) ? |Xi|  (6)  We can calculate the confidence in the Table II. This enables  us to calculate association confidences with roughly O(n) complexity, rather than O(n4) where n is the number of focal elements in the source granule X . For the given example, we get the confidence value 0.67 through Table II. Recall the  example in Section III-A, here we get a value 10?5. Clearly this is a far more reasonable answer, as there are no elements  with strong membership in both granules.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS  A. Film Genre  We have carried out tests on the approach by finding asso-  ciations between movie genres from different online sources.

The two online movie databases IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes  have been used in previous work [16] to test instance match-  ing methods. We have used the SOFT method to establish  correspondence between the (roughly) 95, 000 movies in the  databases. Within these two sources, movies are assigned to  one or more genres and our task is to find strong associations  between genres. In principle one would expect genres to be  at different granularity (e.g. comedy could be sub-divided into  slapstick, satire, situation comedy, etc). At this stage, there is  no benchmark for comparison but the results are intuitively  reasonable as shown in Table III and IV.

We analyse 2,836  thread in total between June 2006 and October 2006. We con-  struct three customer granules - frequent customer, occasional  customer and one-off customer - according to the selection  criteria shown in the Figure 1. We also construct the products  granules, such as BT broadband service, VoIP Service and etc.,  by identifying predefined keywords. Fuzzy grammar [17] has  been proposed to incrementally identify the products from the  text fragments. The results are shown in Table VI and VII.

Terrorism Databases Analysis  We have carried out tests on the Worldwide Incidents Track-  ing System (WITS) and MIPT Terrorism Knowledge Base  (TKB) data 3. 15,900 incidents between January 2005 and Jan-  uary 2006 are analysed . We construct three civilian casualty  granules - high casualty, medium casualty and low casualty  - according to the selection criteria (the number of people  died or injured) shown in the Figure 2. We also construct the  weapon granules, such as Vehicle bomb, Explosive and etc.,  by identifying predefined keywords. Fuzzy grammar [17] has  been proposed to incrementally identify the weapons from the  text fragments. These two different kinds of granules are not  necessarily from the same department but can be distributed by  different specilised group, which allows the people across the  organisation to work collaboratively. The results are shown  in Table VIII and IX. As we can see, ?High casualty? has  tight association with ?Explosive? and ?Vehicle bomb? while  ?Medium casualty? is normally connected with?Firearm?.

For exam-  ple, Iran has the second largest membership in the ?near Iraq?  granule while ?Afghanistan? holds the largest membership  in the ?south asia mainland? granule.

The  result is shown in Table X. The confidence values are low  because most of the perpetrators responsible for the attacks  are ?unknown? in the data sets.

Though most of the perpe-  trators are classified as ?Unknown?, we focus on finding the  strong association rules when the perpetrators are identified.

The results are shown in Table XI and Table XII.

V. CONCLUSION  A new method for generating association rules between  granules is proposed in this paper. These rules enable us to  find related categories without leading to spurious relations  suggested by association rules based on fuzzy cardinalities.

Results were presented for discovery of links between film  genres and terrorism incident databases in different classifica-  tion hierarchies, giving intuitively reasonable associations. The  new method is currently undergoing further tests, looking at  benchmark instance-matching problems, finding associations  between music genres and finding links between business  granules.
