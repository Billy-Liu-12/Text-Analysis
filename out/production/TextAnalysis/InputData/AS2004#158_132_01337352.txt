Abstract- The objective of data mining is to discover new and interesting relationships among the data in large databases. The relationships are expressed in terms of predicates that describe properties of the data. The two most common types of data relationships, co-occurrence and deviation from expectation, are assessed based on the number or distribution of the tuples in the database that are examples of the predicates. Fuzzy predicates were introduced into the partitioning of attribute domains to produce smooth transitions between classes and to facilitate the modeling with linguistic terms. When predicates are fuzzy, a tuple may partially satisfy a predicate and the notion of being an example is also fuzzy. For mining fuzzy relationships, the standard measures of validity for crisp predicates have been extended to fuzzy predicate8 based on the cardinality of fuzzy sets or on the degree to which the tuples satisfy a fuzzy implication. In this paper we use the notions of fuzzy events and fuzzy partitions to better understand the variations of the validity measures for relationships between fuzzy predicates.



I. INTRODUCTION The objective of data mining is to discover new and interesting relationships among the data in large databases.

The language of a knowledge discovery system is defned by a set of predicates that describe properties of the data.

The predicates determine the granularity of the search space and the scope of the potential relationships. In mining data in relational databases, these predicates frequently cover or partition the attribute domains.

The application of fuzzy set theory to knowledge discovery has focused on partitioning attribute domains to avoid the unnatural boundaries that occur in crisp domain partitions and to facilitate the linguistic interpretation of the terms [4], [6], [IS]. In addition to providing smooth transitions between classes, partial membership values provide a method for incorporating the distribution of the data within a partition into the assessment of a rule [21].

The increase in the representational capability afforded by fuzzy rules and the partial satisfaction of predicates requires modifcations to the standard probabilistic measures of rule acceptance used in data mining. Kouk et al. [14] extended the support and confdence measures to fuzzy associations using a T-norm for conjunction and E-count for cardinality.

This straightforward generalization led to anomalies in the assessment of data and the development of new measures of rule confdence using aggregation methods other than the C-count [21, [6]-[8], [16]. The preceding proposals were restricted to the generalization of co-occumnce relationships.

Interest, based on deviation t?om expectation, has received little attention for measuring relationships between fuzzy predicates. The investigations into rule interest in the fuzzy environment [5] ,  [IO] have focused on rule subsumption and variation in hierachical taxonomies.

In [9], [ 1 I] the number of examples and counterexamples of fuzzy implications have been used as the basis for accepting association rules based on co-occurrence. In this paper, the probabilistic interpretation of validity measures of crisp events provides the basis for the generalization to the assessment of fuzzy predicates interpreted as fuzzy events. This formulation provides a straightforward method for extending measures of  both co-occurrence and interest to fuzzy predicates.

The objective of this paper is not to defne a new class of validity measures, hut to better understand the role of examples in data mining with fuzzy predicates. In particular, we show that the preservation of properties of crisp partitions imposes constraints on the selection of T-norms that may be used to    constraints on the selection of T-norms that may be used to determine the number of examples of joint fuzzy predicates.

We begin with a review of the techniques used to measure the confdence or interest in relationships defned by crisp predicates. The standard measures are reformulated in terms of examples and counterexamples to facilitate their extension to the measurement of fuzzy predicates. Section III establishes limitations on T-norms suitable for the determination of ex- amples of joint propositions imposed by the requirements that the predicates cover or partition the attribute domains. This is followed by the examination of the impact these restrictions on the support for a data relationship based on the number of examples and counterexamples in a database.

11. EXAMPLES, COVERS, AND PARTITIONS In this section we review the terminology and and operations used in the representation of relationships between attributes in a relational database. Although presented in terms of crisp sets, the operations and measures considered in this section are designed to encompass the fuzzy case. In particular, we are interested highlighting properties of the crisp analysis whose extension to the fuzzy case are problematic.

Following the strategy employed in the assessment of quan- titative association rules [17], [MI, [201, predicates are used to defne subsets of the attribute domains. By abuse of notation, we will use the same symbol to represent a predicate and the set of tuples that satisfy the predicate. For our purposes, it suffces to consider two attributes A and B. We are interested in the discovery of relationships between tuples in a database SO8 0-7803-8376-1/04/$20.00 Copyright 2004 IEEE.

R whose A attributes are in a set A C A and whose B attributes are in a set B C B. The database R will consist of n tuples t l , .  . . , t,, where t k  = (a ik ,  b j k )  with ai, E A The predicates defne the language of the search process and their associated subsets are assumed to cover, and pos- sibly partition, the underlying domain. We let A I ,  . . . A, and B1,  . . . , Bs denote predicates that cover A and U, respectively.

When there is no confusion, A and B will represent arbitrary predicates from the covers.

'Iluoughout this paper, we will use the characteristic func- tion and bjk E B.

1, i f x E X , 0, otherwise to designate membership in a set or, equivalently, satisfaction of a predicate. When X is fuzzy, the range of p expands from {O, 1) to the interval [O, 11.

The Erst step in the analysis of a database is the summariza- tion of the degree to which the tuples satisfy the predicates in the cover. This process is colloquially referred to as 'binning the data'. Adopting the terminology of probability theory, the individual predicates Ai and Bj will he referred to as marginal properties and combinations A&amp;Bj as joint properties.

For crisp sets, the number of examples of joint properties can he obtained uniquely from the membership of a tuple in the marginals. For the database R, n k = l  ., n N ( A , B )  = C P A ~ ( ~ ~ , )  8 ~ 1 l g ~ V ~ j . ) denote the number of examples of predicates A, B, A&amp;B, where 18 1 = 1 and 1 8 0 = 0 8 1 = 0 8 0 = 0.

For fuzzy predicates, it is not the case that the degree to which a tuple (a,b) is an example of a joint property A&amp;B is uniquely determined by pai(.) and @ g j ( b ) ;  the combining function 8 can he any T-norm. The implications of this Wxibility on the assessment of interest or co-occurrence between fuzzy predicates is the topic of the remainder of this paper.

A minimal property for a set of predicates over an attribute domain is that they cover the domain. If this were not the case, there may be tuples in the database that are unclassifed    case, there may be tuples in the database that are unclassifed by the predicates. The sets B1,.  . . , B, comprise a cover of B if, for every b E B, k = l i=l It is frequently the case that the predicates partition the do- main. That is, Bi f lBj  = 0 whenever i # j and B = U:=, B,.

In this case, the inequality in (1) is replaced by equality (2) When B1,. . . , B, partition U, the partition property (2) is equivalent to i=l N(A)  = N ( 4  Bi), (3) i= l for any A C A.

If the cover contains sets Bi and Bj that are not disjoint, an element b E B+ n Bj is an example of both predicates. Thus the inequality in (1) becomes strict e PEi (b)  &gt; 1. (4) i=l In terms of examples and joint distributions, for any A g A.

The mutual exclusivity of equations (2) and (4) for partitions and covers provide a fundamental difference between the assessment of crisp and fuzzy predicates. In the crisp case, the defnition of partition excludes the possibility of sets in the partition having a nontrivial intersection. This is not the case with fuzzy partitions. As we will see in Section HI, the preservation of either (2) or (4) imposes constraints on the potential methods for assessing the degree to which a tuple is an example of a joint fuzzy property.

111. FUZZY EVENTS AND PARTITIONS We will now consider the evaluation of the degree to which a tuple is an example of a fuzzy predicate. The following assumptions are used throughout the analysis. The initial premise specifes the degree to which a tuple t = (a ,b)  is an example of a fuzzy predicate A over an attribute A.

t = (a, b) is an example of A to degree j iA(a) This is the natural interpretation of set membership as satis- faction of the predicate and is the underlying assumption for the evaluation of the probability of fuzzy events [19], [23].

The second assumption is that the degree to which a tuple is an example of a joint event is the conjunction of the degrees to which it satisfes each of the constituent predicates: the degree to which a tuple (a, b) is an example of the joint property A&amp;B is p ~ ( a )  8 p g ( b )  where 8 is a T-norm.

The fnal assumption is that the predicates over an attribute domain form a fuzzy partition in the style of Ruspini. Thus for an attribute B, Al) AZ) A3) for each b E B, p ~ ,  (b )  = 1 i=l Partitioning the domains is a standard requirement in many fuzzy applications, which employ triangular or trapezoidal Proof: For any A C d, Fig. 1. Intersection in fuzzy panition fuzzy sets to cover the domains. Figure 1 illustrates the domain coverage by adjacent fuzzy sets in a trapezoidal partition.

The question that we must address is bow to determine the number of examples of a joint property from the number of examples of the marginal properties when the predicates form a fuzzy partition of the attribute space. By A2, the degree that a tuple is an example of a joint property depends upon the selection of the T-norm. Using @ = min, a tuple (a, b) with A(a) = .5 and B(b) = .5 is an example of the joint property A&amp;B to degree .5 but to degree .25 for the product T-norm.

We will show that the properties of fuzzy partitions induce natural limitations on the T-norms that can be used to assess the degree that a tuple is an example of joint property.

the degree that a tuple is an example of joint property.

Like crisp partitions, fuzzy partitions satisfy (2). However, unlike crisp partitions, the members of a fuzzy partition may not be disjoint. For example, consider the consecutive fuzzy sets in a trapezoidal partition shown in Figure 1. The element b bas non-zero membership in both Bi and B;+1.

The relationships established for the crisp case give us two possible constraints on the value of joint distributions. When B1,, , . ,E, form a fuzzy partition, the potential constraints are listed in the table below.

I I Prooertv I Associated Constraint I I . ,  I The decision to preserve either of these constraints limits the choice of T-norms that may be used to determine the degree that a tuple is an example of a joint property from the marginal membership values. We ?rst consider the impact of requiring the satisfaction of C1 and then of the less restrictive constraint c2.

Theorems 1 and 2 establish that the product is the only T-norm that ensures the satisfaction of C1.

Theorem I :  If @ = product and B 1 , .  . , B, is a partition of 8, then for any A _C A.

U Theorem 2: Let R be a database with attribute domains A and B and let A a subset of A. The product is the only T-norm that ensures N ( A )  = N ( A ,  4) (6) p=1 for all partitions B1,. . . , B, of B and all sets of tuples.

Pmof: The proof consists of providing a simple domain in which the product is the only T-norm that the can preserve C1 for all possible partitions. Let A = { a }  and B = { b }  be attributes and consider the partitions A1 = x/a, Az = 1-z/a of A and B1 = y/b, Az = 1 - y/b of B. Let R consist of the single tuple (U, b) .

BY C1, N(A1)  =N(Ai,Bi)+N(Ai,&amp;).

2 = (z c3 y) + (z @ 1 - y).

In terms of membership values, this becomes (7) In [I], Alsina established that the product is the only T-norm that satisfes the functional equation (z @ Y) e? (. c3 4Y)) = x for all 0 5 z,y 5 1, where @ is a T-conorm and n is a strong negation. Letting n(y) = 1 - y and e? be addition, the Lukasiewicz T-conorm, produces the condition given in (7) Thus Alsina's theorem establishes the product is the unique T- norm for evaluating the degree to which a tuple is an example  of a fuzzy predicate that ensures the satisfaction of C2. 0 Note that the wording of Theorem 2 does not claim that other T-norms cannot satisfy C1 for particular partitions or data distributions, only that the product is the sole T-norm that satisfes it in all cases. For example, if the sets B1, . . . , B, form a crisp partition of B. then C1 holds for any T-norm.

Condition C1 is also satisfed if the B;s form a fuzzy partition, and the B attributes of all the tuples in the database occur only in the cores of the Bis.

We may, however, choose to maintain the less restrictive property C2. In this case, there is a range of T-norms bounded by product and minimum, which is the T-norm with maximal value, that could be used in the determination of examples.

IV. VALIDITY MEASURES Two general types of relationships have been analyzed in data mining, co-occurrence and interest. Co-occurrence measures the degree to which the satisfaction of a predicate A predicts that of B in the tuples in the database. Co-occurrence is the standard relationship examined in the market basket paradigm [20]. The frst four entries in Table I give several co-occurrence measures formulated in terms of number of examples.

The confdence measure is the classic measure for assessing the validity of an association. For crisp associations, m ( A  + B) is the conditional probability of a relevant tuple being an example. The number of examples of an association is specif- ically indicated in the numerator, but the counterexamples are relegated to the normalization in the denominator.

Kodratoff [I31 criticized confdence as a measure of asso- ciation validity because it assigns 0.5 to a set of tuples in which 50% are examples and 50% are counterexamples. He commented that this "is too high when descriptive implications are looked for and to low when causal implications are looked for.'' For assessing the validity of a descriptive association such as 'if a customer purchase contains potato chips, it also contains soda' a threshold signifcantly less than 0.5 is appropriate. With an inventory of 10,000 items, the Occurrence of such an implication in 3% of the transactions represents a signifcant relationship. However, it is clear that a causal relationship such as 'if a woman is Swedish, then she has blonde hair' should require a much higher threshold for acceptance.

Because of the difference in the nature of descriptive and causal implications, Kodratoff proposed separate confrmation measures for each type of association. In terms of examples and counterexamples, Kodratoff's confrmation measure m f d ( A  + B )  = P(A,  B )  - P(A,  ' B ) the number of examples and counterexamples scaled by the size of the database. The range of m f d  is [-1,1] with negative values indicating support for A + 7 B  and positive values for A + B.  For causal associations, the measure m f c ( A  j B)  = P(A,  B)  + P(-A,  ' B )  - 2P(A, ' B ) includes tuples (a, b) with a A and b # B as confrming instances. The confrm causal measure is neutral between A + B and A + -B whenever P(A1B) = P(AI7B) and P(B1A) = P(BI7A) and values in the range [-.5, .5] may be produced by data distributions satisfying these conditions.

Rather than basing acceptance on the difference of examples to counterexamples, another approach is to directly consider the ratio of examples to counterexamples [9]. The ratio of ex- amples to counterexamples may be obtained from confdence measures by con(A + B )  - P(A,  B )  rat(A + B)  = - m ( A  =+ 7 B )  P(A,  ' B )  ' The fnal two measures in Table 1 are examples of interest- ingness measures [ 121, [ 181. Measures of interests measure the deviation of examples from a statistical expectation. Piatetsky- Shapiro proposed r i (A + B )  = P(A,  B )  - P(A)P(B) The value zero indicates that the occurrence of A and B    are independent and consequently there is no interest in the relationship of attributes A and B.

Brin et. al. [3] proposed the symmetric measure to identify correlation of attributes rather. A correlation of 1 indicates no interest, values greater than 1 indicate support for A + B and less than 1 for A + 7 B .  Acceotance of an for descriptive associations is simply the difference between association is based on the chi- squared statistic.

The ranges given in Table I are produced by the assessment of crisp data. In particular, the derivation of these ranges utilize the equality N ( A )  = N(A&amp;E) + N(A&amp;-B).

This relationship does not necessarily hold when A and B are fuzzy sets.

Numerous other methods for the measurement of associa- tions and attribute relationships have been proposed 1131, [22].

The measures discussed above were selected as representa- tives of the general classes of confdence and interestingness measures that have natural interpretations in terms of the comparison of examples and counterexamples.

v. INTERVAL MEASURES By the arguments in Section III, any T-norm ?3 whose values are hounded by zy 5 z ?3 y 5 min{z,y} is suitable for determining the degree to which a tuple is an example of a joint property from the marginal membership functions. In this section we examine several examples to gain an intuitive understanding of the range of values that can he produced assessing co-occurrence and interest of fuzzy attributes in this manner.

Once the number of examples of the marginal and joint properties are determined, the validity measures can he ob- tained utilizing the formulas in Table 1. We begin with the following simple data set in which the membership values of the tuples exhibit a perfect gradual relationship: TI: nu;her A i !  E;!

0.2 0.2 1 0.1 0.1 Using the T-norm min, the number of examples of A&amp;B  is 2.0, of A&amp;-B is 0.6, and of -A&amp;-B is 2.0. The corre- sponding values for the product T-norm are 1.5, 0.5, and 1.5.

The measures yield con min 0.8 prod 0.39 confd  mnfC rat ~i COTT 0.1 0.03 3.3 0.15 1.6 -0.12 -0.07 0.76 -0.05 0.78 Due to the symmetry in the data, the number of examples of A&amp;B and -A&amp;TB are identical. This causes confd and rat to have neutral values for both T-norms. In this case, the selection of the T-norm causes a signifcant variation in the result only in the case of standard confdence and correlation.

The next example considers tuples that would intuitively support a certainty relationship between A and B. That is, the Dienes implication max(1- A(a),  B(b)} is near 1.0 for each C m  confd min 1.0 0.0 prod 0.75 0.0 of these tuples.

0.2 0.1 cmfc Tat Ti COTT 0.2 1.0 0.25 2.0 0.25 1.0 0.23 1.5 B(b) 0.9 0.8 0.8 0.9    The T-norms min produce 2.0 examples of A&amp;B, 0.6 of A&amp;+3, and 0.6 of -A&amp;-B. The corresponding values for the product T-norm are 1.7, 0.3, and 0.3. The measures yield prod I 0.85 I 0.7 I 0.35 I 5.7 I 0.0 1 0.0 As with the data in TI, there is a notable difference between the confdence measures with the two T-norms. There are also differences in the ratio of examples to counterexamples and the interest measures. The analysis of the examples generated by the minimum indicate that the association A =$ B may he of interest. However, with the examples produced by the product T-norm, both of the interest measures are neutral.

One fnal example considers tuples tuples with no discem- able pattem.

af T - - m={a,b,p} with parameter p .  Setting p to 0 produces the minimum and 1 produces the product. For a particular set of data, the optimal T-norm could he identifed by Ending the value of the parameterp E [0,1] that maximizes the validity measure under consideration. The optimization could use either algebraic or numeric methods, hut the latter seem more suitable for the analysis of large data sets.



VI. CONCLUSION The determination of the degree that a tuple is an example of a fuzzy rule or association depends upon the underlying relationship between the attributes. In data mining, this re- lationship is not known a number of possible methods for determining 'examplehood' should be considered. When the attribute domains are covered or partitioned by the predicates, the relationship between joint and marginal distributions im- pose restrictions on the suitability of T-norms to evaluate the degree a tuple is an example of an association. The parametric representations of T-norms presents the possibility of simultaneously learning both the relationship between the attributes and the proper assessment of the number of examples and counterexamples.
