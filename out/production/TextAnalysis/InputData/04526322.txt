Abstract?The increasing needs of European observation and telecommunication satellite services, with respect to operations efficiency, require the development of an advanced in-orbit infrastructure for data relay services. The function of a data relay satellite is to forward data between two elements with which it has established a direct communication link. Currently the infrastructure is based on the ESA ARTEMIS satellite that has been operative since 2003 and that will be at end-of-life by the end of 2010. In this frame Thales Alenia Space Italia (TAS-I) and University of Rome ?Tor Vergata? (TOR) are conceiving the new European Second Generation Data Relay Satellite System (E?GDRSS) based on state of the art and innovative space technologies and telecommunication techniques. This paper12 presents the main design options according to preliminary trade-off analysis, which will represent the baseline to the design of the full system.

INTRODUCTION The DRS (Data Relay Satellite) systems are foreseen to operate in the near future in a dual-use (civil and military) scenario, supporting both commercial and security related services and  cooperating with a multiplicity of different space systems ranging from Earth observation to the deep space missions. In this frame TAS-I and TOR are cooperating in the definition, specification and design of the European Second Generation Data Relay Satellite System (E?GDRSS) [1], [2].

This paper deals with the preliminary results obtained in the context of the feasibility study currently ongoing in the 2 IEEEAC paper #1550, Version 2, Updated Dec 13, 2007  frame of an activity supported by the Italian and European Space Agencies (ASI and ESA).

The DRS will provide a great range of telecommunication and localization services to the User Segments, where the User Segments include:  ? User Space Terminals, as LEO (Low Earth Orbit) and MEO (Medium Earth Orbit) satellites but also launchers  ? User Earth Mobile and fixed Terminals  ? Aeronautical users flying up to high stratospheric altitudes, as UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle)  Moreover, in the future, the Data Relay satellite System could be a valid support for emerging space exploration plans and deep space missions, such as:  ? Moon Exploration in all its phases from the early robotic exploration to human sortie and human outpost phases  ? Mars Exploration, in particular the related new robotic exploration phase and the subsequently human exploration, envisaged after 2030  Furthermore, the E?GDRSS will be an autonomous infrastructure and could be considered as a system of systems that has a high relevance with respect to a large strategic services area such as: emergency services for disaster recovery, theatres of war, high level institutional services. In this paper a preliminary architecture for the new DRS will be presented together with the most important high level capabilities of the system and the innovative technologies and solutions. In the first part of this work a trade off analysis for the identification of the main system characteristics will be presented, based on user requirements identified by partitioning users in different categories. A frequency bands analysis employed on each service link will be shown, including also the most advanced EHF developments such as the use of Q/V-band (33-75 GHz) even W-band (75-110 GHz) (i.e., for inter-satellite or deep space user links)[3]. Afterwards, the full architecture will be identified including all the main mission architectural components as Space, Ground and User segments. Finally, the paper conclusion will be presented.

2. SECOND GENERATION DRS: OBJECTIVES AND NOVELTIES   In order to design such a complex system, some major requirements have been identified. This system has to:  ? supply services to a very large space user population, being a real dual use system able to meet the needs of scientific, commercial and defence customers  ? use technologies able to increase the communication availability and data rates on each link involved in the system architecture (inter-orbit links, feeder links, earth users links, etc.)  ? guarantee full interoperability with other operational data relay and tracking systems  ? guarantee backward compatibility towards the user space terminals (USTs) and user earth terminals (UETs) currently operating within the Artemis- based DRS  ? act as enabling constituent of a future ESA in orbit telecommunication infrastructure  The preliminary E?GDRSS system architecture has been defined considering the following technical drivers:  ? New technological developments of space qualified components for space communications both in optic and RF (especially EHF, Extremely High Frequency, 30-300 GHz) bands (able to provide high performance for the future system services).

? Technological progress in bandwidth efficient modulation schemes and high protection codes, improving overall data rates and services availability.

? New development in the field of reconfigurable communication links based on PIMT (Propagation Impairments Mitigation Techniques), as AMC (Adaptive Modulation and Coding).

Service areas are the combination of a permanent wide service area (extending the actual Artemis European coverage in order to include all the 25 European Countries), a theatre spot beams service area (composed by at least four steerable spot beams) and on-space service areas. The system will be able to support different traffic typologies, involving on-ground gateway and user stations, such as: bidirectional traffic between gateway stations in European countries to/from VSAT terminals and nomadic stations both in European coverage and in theaters of operation, broadcast traffic from gateway stations in Europe to nomadic user stations in theatres of operations, point-to- point or point-to-multipoint traffic among nomadic user stations located in theaters or among VSAT terminals in European coverage.

3. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE  The architecture of a space mission is organized into the following components [4]:  1) Subjects 2) Orbit 3) Spacecraft platform 4) Payload 5) Launcher 6) Communications architecture 7) Mission operation 8) Ground element   Each component of the architecture will be analyzed in the following subsections.

3.1 SUBJECTS  In this subsection, the E?GDRSS applications, services and potential users will be identified. With respect to application and services the system should provide: wide-band communication, observation data capture and dissemination, positioning and timing services and space missions support services. In order to satisfy all services requirements the system should have an high traffic capacity, availability and reliability. The applications could be divided into scientific ones, such as space and Earth observation, space exploration and manned space vehicles support, and institutional ones, such as security and navigation/positioning. Starting from this applications partitioning, in Table 1 some of  the E?GDRSS potential users have been identified together with the actual service providers.

3.2 ORBIT  In general, we can deploy more than one DRS satellite leading to a constellation of DRS satellites. However, because of financial constraints, the E?GDRSS will be composed of only one satellite. The orbit of this data relay satellite is selected on the basis of a set of requirements such as: service area and coverage and visibility with the subjects (ground stations and service spacecraft); delay requirements are not considered during the orbit selection phase for this kind of services. The DRS satellite should allow continuous visibility with Earth stations for data download and maximum visibility with service satellites. Therefore, the conclusion about the orbit type lead to the selection of a GEO (Geostationary Orbit) orbit. The selection of the longitude for the GEO orbit is dictated by the minimum separation angle with existing satellites in GEO orbit (at least 1.5 degrees) the location of the ground stations. The geostationary orbital position is currently left as variable parameter to be used in a system trade-off analysis to be jointly performed with the space agencies (ESA and ASI).

Table 1: E?GDRSS Potential Users.

3.3 SPACECRAFT PLATFORM  The spacecraft platform supports the payload by providing orbit and attitude maintenance, power, command telemetry, temperature control and the needed mechanical structures.

The most interesting options for the spacecraft bus are:  ? a medium GEO platform such as the Spacebus 4000B2-high developed by TAS  ? a large GEO platform such as the Alphabus developed jointly by Thales Alenia Space and EADS Astrium with the support of ESA [5]  The main characteristics of the two options for the spacecraft bus are summarized in Table 2.

Table 2: Main characteristics of selected spacecraft buses.

Spacebus 4000B2-high  Alphabus  Lifetime 15 years > 15 years Dry mass 1440 kg 7500 kg Launch mass 3400 kg 8000 kg Payload mass 390 kg 1000 kg Payload power 5450 W 12-18 kW Height 2.9 m 7 m    The criteria driving the selection of the spacecraft platform is to allow the embark of the payloads (payload mass and size), and to guarantee the functioning (payload power).

However, further options will be considered in the future.

3.4 PAYLOAD  The E?GDRSS GEO satellite will carry several payloads each dedicated to a certain communication link. Table 3 shows a preliminary trade-off carried out to identify the most suitable frequency bands for each link which is characterised on the basis of the corresponding user segment; as it can bee seen for some link the use of innovative frequency bands (as W band, wherein there are two allocated bands for satellite communications: 71-76 GHz and 81-86 GHz) is foreseen. As previously introduced, some ground steerable beams are included in the system architecture.

Table 3 ? E?GDRSS service links band allocation.

Band Feeder Link Fixed/Steerable In Orbit Links   Ground  link GEO-Hub GEO-Space GEO-GEO GEO-LEO GEO-UAV/HAP  Support to LEOP  Steerable Beem  S      Primary Ka Primary Primary  Secondary  (Artemis compatibility)   Primary  Q / V Secondary Secondary  Secondary Secondary W  Secondary Secondary Primary Primary  Optical   Primary Primary (Artemis compatibility) Primary    3.4.1 GEO-HUB  The E?GDRSS satellite ? Hub link foresees both  a fixed and a steerable forward link; the Ka band is the baseline choice for these links in order to support wide spots having high capacity and maintaining backward compatibility with the current Artemis ground segment and interoperability with other data relay systems as TDRSS (Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System). The secondary option foresees the use of Q band in order to realize narrow beams in specific target areas.

3.4.2 GEO-SPACE  With respect to the E?GDRSS satellite ? to ? Deep Space mission link the Ka band is considered as the baseline in order to be compliant with the actual roadmap of the Space Agencies but higher frequency band, as Q and W, link performance could be investigated. As a matter of fact, the low number of space exploration missions make it possible to propose the use of an innovative technology such as the W band in a medium term perspective.

The on-going and the last deployed space missions have shown important changes in space approach. Many missions dedicated to study the Universe (operational and planned) choose to observe from Earth-trailing heliocentric orbits and from Sun-Earth Lagrange points rather than LEO orbits.

Moreover, the use of low-cost satellite constellations is envisaged in order to collect data in a coordinated and continuous way. At the same time, missions for planetary exploration increased their duties, moving from simple missions of reconnaissance to detailed investigation of planets through remote sensing.

At present, an extra space NASA/ASI mission, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO), was the last one deployed to Mars to characterize the surface, subsurface, and atmosphere of the red planet. Its objective is also to identify potential landing sites for future missions. This orbiter hosts some telecommunications systems that will establish a foundation for future spacecraft, becoming the first link in a communications bridge back to Earth ("Interplanetary Internet"). It will help the communications of future international spacecraft fleets. In addition, the MRO will  test the potential of using Ka-band to demonstrate greater performance in communications.

The future trend of increasing number of missions into deep space determines the growth of data richness and more data- intensive instruments. Moreover, this evolution requires an increase in returned data volumes and  higher data rates, envisaging the need of data relay nodes in space.

W-band could represent an ideal way to answer to these needs, since the trend for space telecommunication systems is the use of higher frequencies, the main reasons being:  saturation of  lower frequency bands growth of data-rate request reduction of mass and size of equipments  Considering that the main disadvantage of the use of W- band frequencies is the additional atmospheric attenuation, all its benefits could be fully exploited in space communications. For instance, considering the lack of atmosphere on the Moon, we envisage that a future interesting application of this innovative frequency band could be a link between a lander or a station on the surface of the Moon (or Mars) and an orbiter, that could act as a data-relay node towards an Earth station (for example, the Deep Space Network).

3.4.3 GEO-GEO  With respect to the E?GDRSS satellite ? to ? GEO link the optical frequency band is selected as a baseline due to the (theoretical) very low relative movements between the two satellites. This feature allows to relax the pointing requirements (critical issue for optical links) and thus to exploit all the potential of optical systems (it should be mentioned that the great link distance is a critical issue and it will be analyzed during the next phases of the study).

Moreover, the W band will be analyzed as a secondary option.

3.4.4 GEO-LEO  With respect to the E?GDRSS satellite ? to ? LEO link the use of Ka band is selected as a baseline and optical band as a secondary choice in order to ensure the interoperability     and the compatibility with Artemis system and with its user segment.

Due to the strategic role of EHF band and to the Italian industrial heritage (acquired during the Italsat scientific Missions) it is proposed the use of Q/V bands as an alternative.

It should be noted that at present it seems that this typology of satellites represents the major part of the expected user segment of the E?GDRSS.

3.4.5 GEO-UAV/HAP  With respect to the E?GDRSS satellite ? to ? UAV/HAP (High Altitude Platform) link the use of W band is selected as a baseline primarily due to:  ? Reduction in mass and size of telecommunication payloads (and especially of their antennas)  ? The big volume of data produced by technologically advanced instruments requires an high data-rate communication system to deliver this information to the control station  ? The very narrow beamwidth (and the fact that the W-band technology is still a niche one) make safer and reliable the data transmission   These are key payload features in applications like UAV and HAP communication systems. Q/V bands are selected as a secondary option.

Several operative militar or dual use systems must be considered as potential users of the Data Relay service.

Such types of systems need a reliable link with respect to induced interferences and characterized by an high security.

These requirements suggest the use of high frequencies such as W and Q/V bands. Table 4 shows two additional payloads implementing respectively TT&C (Telemetry Tracking and Command) and Emergency functions and a preliminary trade-off carried out to identify the most suitable frequency bands for each system.

Table 4 ? TT&C and Emergency band allocation.

Communications Subsystem Band TT&C Emergency S  Baseline  Ka Baseline    3.5 LAUNCHER  The launcher must be selected with the aim to meet the requirements for:  ? compatibility with spacecraft mass and size ? launch to GEO orbit    The Spacebus series of platforms is compatible with several commercial launchers such as Ariane 5, Thor Delta, Atlas Rocket, Soyuz, Proton, Long March. Alphabus is designed to be compatible with Ariane 5 or any new-generation commercial launcher with a fairing diameter of 5 meters.

3.6 COMMUNICATIONS ARCHITECTURE  The communications architecture is the configuration of links and the related communication network for the transfer of information between satellites and ground stations. As stated in the abstract, the function of the DRS satellite is to forward data between two elements. Some examples of these two elements may be:  ? an earth orbiting satellite and an earth station ? a Moon (or Mars) orbiting satellite and an earth  station ? two earth orbiting satellites ? a ground terminal and a space user (i.e. UAV)   These links may be unidirectional or bidirectional: command and control links are bidirectional, while links for the transport of data are unidirectional (towards the ground station), but must support bidirectional communication when error recovery mechanisms such as Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) are required, in this case an asymmetric capacity is needed.

3.7 MISSION OPERATION  Once the spacecraft is designed and built, we have to operate it. Getting ready for DRS operations requires extensive advance planning and development of the teams and facilities we need in order to actually conduct the mission.  A list of the main mission operation functions that should be carried out during the period after launch is:  ? mission planning ? activity planning and development ? mission control ? data transport and delivery ? orbit control and maneuvers ? spacecraft bus management ? payload management    3.8 GROUND ELEMENT  The E?GDRSS ground segment consists of:  ? gateway and user stations supporting user traffic exchange located within the wide European service area and in the theatre spot beams service area;  ? mission and satellite control centre, able to exchange TT&C (Telemetry Tracking and Command) with the GEO DRS satellite;     ? on ground distributed user Earth terminals, being the traffic user installations for the support of traffic and control connectivity to/from the user space terminals.

4. CONCLUSION   This paper presented possible design options for the E?GDRSS, with a particular focus to system architecture and payload. One of the key element of the future generation of DRS systems is the use of very high frequency bands such as Q/V and even W-bands, since lower frequency bands have saturation problems, furthermore high frequencies allow to reduce the size of the users payloads and with respect to the first generation DRS.

The E?GDRSS future activities will use the baseline introduced in this paper in order to design the full system.
