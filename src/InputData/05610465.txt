I. INTRODUCTION  With the rapid development of Internet, more and  more resource information continuously added to the  network. However, information on the Internet is too  bulky, users do not know how to access the content for    their own need. Access to the Internet a common way to  obtain information is view. This method is suitable for the  situation that purpose here is not clear, when the user  needs to fmd a specific content, efficiency of the method  is very poor. Therefore, it is expected that more efficient  tools for the emergence of information services to help  users quickly items of concern it may set.

Literature [5] use based on the nearest neighbor users  collaborative filtering technology recommended for users.

But in practice its shortcomings of the sparsity and  scalability are gradually exposed.In literature [I],  according to the similarity between the project  preliminary forecast the score which the users did not  score, calculated on this basis then calculate the target  user's nearest neighbor. This method with the number of  users and projects increases linearly, system performance  and scalability is still poor. And when calculate the  similarity of the project even the two projects are very  similar, but may also be because of the lack of a common  assessment of their users, lead to inaccurate of the  forecasting project score.

Association rules are the most commonly used method  for found the associations between items and items.

According to the associations between items and item  relationship, be able to find all association rules which  meet a certain degree of support and confidence. When  the projects recommended for the target user, the first to  978-1-4244-7956-6/10/$26.00 20 1 0 IEEE   fmd out all the rules of the user support, the left items of  such rules are all in the item sets which he has chosen, and  then make the items in the right join the recommended set  Ru of condidat, fmally, Ru sort by confidence, if an item  appears in the right side of number of rules, take the  highest degree of confidence, and will recommend to the  user before the N items. The advantages of this method  are: (I) The relationship between the item and the item is  static, when use it provide those recommendations to  users, they can avoid each recalculation, rules generated in  recommended algorithm for association rules can be  carried offline in advance, therefore recommend more  efficient, which make the performance of the system    higher efficiency than based on the nearest neighbor users  collaborative filtering technology to some extent. (2)  When use the association rules to find the association  relationship between two items, unlike literature [I], it is  not subject to the common choice of the item number of  users, so that it can more accurately fmd the relationships  between the items.

However, the algorithm still has two drawbacks: (1)  the most famous the Apriori algorithm thinks that each  item is the item which has the same importance in the  whole item set. Virtually the position of every item in the  item set is not exactly the same. If one item be selected by  many users, it indicates the high degree of concern by the  user, and then this items occupies very important position  in the whole item set. Another example is a Web  documents which published an important notice, when to  provide recommendations to the user the recommendation  should be to come out. (2) Recommendation based on  association rules is according to the habits of all users's  choices to establish the link between items, in the  recommendation will recommend the after pieces of the  rules which has the higher confidence to the user, not  considered the concerned about the tendency when the  user selects items, recommendations lack certain targeted,  make recommendation accuracy is less than based on the  nearest neighbor users collaborative filtering technology.

This paper presents a WIR algorithm, that is, user  attention items recommendation algorithm based on  weighted association rules, to recommend user attention  items. We compared the WIR algorithm proposed in this  paper with the algorithm in literature [I] by the  experiment. Experiment verification, the paper provides a  good performance algorithm, and recommends the project  to users with the user's click-through rate than the  algorithm in the literature [I] has increased.

II. USER ATTENTION ITEMS RECOMMENDATION  ALGORITHM BASED ON WEIGHTED ASSOCIATION RULES  The text for each item given a weight W, using the  weighted value of the project reflected the extent of  concern of the various items, reflecting the importance of  various items in the entire item sets. WIR algorithm is    based on the improved algorithm [3] in the literature  formed. Introduced the concept of user profiles, using  algorithm [3] proposed weighted association rules  discovery algorithm to discover the relationship between  item and item. In the recommendation, in order to reflect  the tendency which user tend to select items of interest,  introduce the concept of concern about the selection, and  concern about the selection combined with the confidence  to recommend for the target users, to make up for the  feature about the traditional recommendation algorithm  based on association rules in accordance with the size of  confidence broadly recommend to the users its accuracy  rate is less than the based on the nearest neighbor users  collaborative filtering technology.

WIR algorithm is divided into two steps: (1) the use of  the weighted association rule discovery algorithm based  on user profiles, found that the association between item  and item, set for the project to establish the term and term  association model; (2) in the associated model to fmd the  association rules which the target users supported,  according to the size of recommendation degrees to  provide the project's recommendation for the target users.

Recommendation is defined as the product of the  confidence and the concern about the selection.

A. Weighted association rules discovery algorithm  based on the user pro/1le  According to the literature [3] proposed weighted  association rules discovery algorithm, set up I as a  collection for the items, then the support of the form as  A=> B( A c I, Be I, run B = <II) association rules, to calculate  the weighted support.

(0 -sup = [}?JB w/lSUP(A? B) (1)  Among, [ L Wi] is the total weights of all items in  0EAJB  A,B, sup( A ? B) is the support of the rule A=> B.

Because in the weighted association rules model a  subset of frequent item sets may not be frequent, so can  not use the nature of Apriori algorithm for any subset in  the frequent item must be frequent. This literature[3] also  introduced k-expectations, that if the q-item set Y is a  subset of a frequent k-item sets (q < k), then the weighted  support of the frequent k-item sets should not be less than    B (Y, k). B (y, k) is calculated as follows:  B(Y,k) = ro-min-supxm (2)  W(Y,k)  Among, ro -min-sup is the minImum weighted  support; And W (Y, k) is calculated as follows:  W(Y,k) = I wJ+ I w" (3) IjeY /=1   Here, Y is a q-itemset, q <k. In the remaining projects  set (1-Y) in, (k-q) a weighted value of the largest project in  mind for the irl, ir2, ... , irk-q, W (Y, k) that contains the  item set Y of any k-item sets the maximum possible  values.

In this article, the input data expressed as a R: m x n  user-options matrix, the user selects a note of the user  concerned, m is the number of users, n is the number of  items. R is a 0,1 matrix, fij = I that the first i-users to  select the first j entries. And rij =  means no choice of the.

Set the project set to I = { h, b, ...  , in }, to characterize the  importance of items focused on different items for each  entry ij is given a weight Wj. Empowerment in a key value,  to reflect the extent of the project concern the use of the  frequency of items selected by the user as to the weights,  let the user select the item number ij Nj, then Wj = Nj I m,  and its rounded up. It also introduces the concept of user  profiles, user i's profile, said with a row vector Ui, Ui  elements for the user has selected an item, the set of  vectors Vi shall set all the user profile, with U said.

Centralized user profile found for Weighted  Association Rules algorithm is as follows:  Algorithm 1 find item weighted association rules  Enter the user profile set, the weight of each item Wj,  minimum confidence min _ conf, minimum weighted  support OJ - min - sup; frequent item set L = <I> ;  Output weighted association rule sets WAR;  WAR+-<II  II Centralized user profile vector length of the largest  Ilvalue of U as a frequent item sets the maximum possible  Illength, is also k-support bound the Ilmaximum value k.

Sizemax = Mat( size( U,); Il s ism  for i = 1 to Sizemax do  C = <I> , Li = <I> ; II Ci for a possible subset of  Ilfrequent i-item collection, Li for the frequent i-item    Ilcollection, initially are empty.

for j = 1 to n do  {sc(ij) ; I I Process sc(ij) calculated the number of  Ilusers ij.

for k = 2 to Sizemax do  if sc@ >= B( {ij },k) then  C 1 <- ij; I I The formation of frequent 1-itemsets  Ilmay be frequent k-item subset of the set  }  for k = 2 to Sizemax do  { Ck= Link (Ck-I); (1)  Ck = Prune (Ck); (2)  }  If (co _sup (Ck) 2: OJ _ min_sup)  Lk<- Ck;  L = L U  itemsets L  II Frequent k-item set formed  Lk ; I I The formation of frequent  WAR = Rulesgen(L); (3)  The following algorithm (1), (2) and (3) in the three  key processes in detail:  (1) The process of Link (Ck-I): the process of Link (Ck  I) is generated by the Ck-l link Ck. Ck-I Ck link generation  method is: if Ck-I in each element of the pre-k-2 entries are  the same, then the elements of Ck-I division can be  connected. For example, in C3 {2,3,4}, {2,3,5} the two  elements, then the connection form {2,3,4,5}.

(2) Process Prune (Ck): procedure Prune (Ck) purpose  is to connect the Ck generating frequent item in the  collection can not be set to delete the element. Remove  method is: Calculate the set of Ck in the support of the  project number and all the support expected, if a k-item  sets the number of less than all of its support for the  support of the expectations can be determined later in the  traversal of it can not be any frequent subset of items to be  deleted. In this process is complete, all may be a subset of  frequent item sets of k-item sets constitute the candidate  set Ck.

(3) process Rulesgen (L): In Rulesgen (L), the right  frequent set L generated all of its non-empty subset of L s  for each non-empty subset s=>(L-s) of the confidence    calculation rules conf, if the conf :::: min _ conf, will be  added to the WAR in the weighted association rule sets.

B. Recommended set if user interests in the production  In the weighted association rule discovery algorithm,  the weights of items is selected by the user through the  items to get the frequency reflects the key focus on the  degree of concern, but the establishment of the weighted  association rule set is based on habits of all users to select  items, items of concern to users used to fmd the  association between relationship established, if the pure  level of confidence to recommend the use can not reflect  the user's personality, recommendations for current users  should also take into account the objectives of the project  when the user selects some of the concerns tend to not  simply the customer support of association rules  according to rules of confidence after the pieces of the  size of direct referral to the user. Therefore, the  introduction of choice attention, in their recommendations  will choose attention, and rules to combine the  recommended level of confidence, reflecting the concern  of users tend to select projects.

Concerned about the degree of choice is based on the  idea: When the user has selected an item, then when the  user select the other item he has n choices, that the user  selected the item h, he may choose to b, also may choose  to is, also may select other items. Well, the choice of a  relatively high frequency in these options appear should  be users tend to be, the more concerned choice.

In user - option matrix, all the users are as a whole to  consider the concerns of the key choices. If some users  pre-m options are the same, while the first m + 1 option  has n choices, which set Si for the support of the user  selected the first i kind of choices, that the user through  the fmt i kind of choice, select the frequency of the next  item. The average support for each selected as  S = :t Sj In' the concerned about the degree of choice of  1=1  the first k (k = 1,2 ,,,., n) choice can be defmed as  P=Skl s  After we get the weighted association rules, set up the  associated model between the items. When recommend     the target users the focus projects, the first under the item  set that the user has selected and the weighted rule sets,  fmd the weighted association rule set that the item of the  user has chosen to support, then calculate concerns the  choice of degree (attention) which the user to select,  specific algorithm is as follows:  Algorithm 2 Users concerned about the project  recommended set generation algorithm  Input: weighted association rules WAR, the minimum  recommended degree min Jecom  Output: recommendation set R  R?<I> ;  Select ?{ ij' "., ik }; I I The items of the target user  l/has selected  for each rule (A => B) of WAR do  {if Select c A then I I The Association Rules that  Iluser support  Calculate the concern in the degree of attention that the  user selects the item in Select and then choose the item in  B;  recom = conf( A=> B) * attention;  if recom:::: min Jecom then R ? B; }

III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND ANALYSIS  In the experiment, using the Web document as a test  object, about a Web document as a per item. Use the 400  pages in "Chinese Sciencepaper Online" website as a test  set, for convenience of operation; we build an index  number for each page. From the historical information of  the 400 pages that the users accessed, select the access  information of 20 users, which each user in these 20 users  at least visited 20 pages. In the test using Given X test  method, take X = 0.8, about 80% data of the entire data  set as the training set, 20% data as the test set.

We use the computer has Intel P4 2.4GHz ,  DDR256MB, Windows XP platform, using Java  language to implement the WIR algorithm in the text and  the algorithm (referred to as IRP algorithm) proposed by  Literature [1].

A. Compare the user hits if the recommended items if  the two algorithms  In the experiment, using the average rate of  recommendation that the user clicks on the recommended    projects, to measure the accuracy of the algorithm .

, I' k the actual number of users click on the item Item user c IC rate = ------------  number of recommended projects  The average click rate use each user hits of users with  the test data set, the total number of each user hits divided  by the number of users to get. Users generally more  interest in the previous 7 items that recommend to them,  and the items after the previous 7 items users will not see  how, so in the experiment the number of items  recommended by a maximum of 10. We calculated  respectively when the recommended number of pages C =  2,4,6,8,10 the average click rate of the users, as shown in  Table 1 and Figure 1, we can see that the in the text the  average click rate of users of the WIR algorithm than IRP  algorithm increased 6.68%.

Algorithm execution time compared  When comparing the performance of algorithms, used  to measure the average prediction time, the average  prediction time was express by the result of training time  and testing time (corresponding to the learning stage and  application stage of the recommended system) divided by  the number of the forecast project. Performance  comparison of two algorithms had shown in Figure 2, in  which the horizontal axis as the items of the item set  (website), the vertical axis as the average forecast time, in  seconds. When the page number of relatively low, the  average predicted time of the use of WIR algorithm is less  ?han the IRP algorithm, but the number of pages gradually  mcrease, the average predicted time of the use of WIR  algorithm is more and more obvious less than the IRP    algorithm use the WIR algorithm.

IV. CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK  By establishing a information service platform that  oriented user's needs, can improve the effective  utilization of network information resources, allowing  users to timely, accurate and fast access to the knowledge  and information that they actual needs. Algorithm  presented in this paper, by give weight to the items in the  item set to reflect the extent of the item, reflecting the  importance of items in the item set. Because the  relationship between the item and item is static, in the  establishment of weighted association rule set the  complexity of the algorithm is low than based on nearest  neighbor collaborative filtering technology. Use the  metho of combine the degree of choice attention and  association rules confidence to recommend to the users,   overcome the the shortcomings of the low accuracy of the  recommend that simple use the confidence in association  rules.
