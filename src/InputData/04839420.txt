Abstract?Next-generation communications satellite constellations will use advanced radio frequency (RF) technologies to provide Internet protocol (IP) packet- switched high-speed backbone transport services for various user communication applications, with ever-increasing traffic demand. These applications range from data services to imagery, voice, video, and other potential emerging applications. Satellite uplinks and downlinks may endure channel impairments that have fades of varying durations due to weather, communications on the move (COTM) blockages, scintillation, terrestrial multipath, or jamming.
