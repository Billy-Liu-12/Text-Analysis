The Fault Diagnosis Algorithm for Transformer  Based on Extenics and Rough Set Theory

Abstract-As one of the most important equipments to guarantee power gird operating safely and stably, the fault diagnosis of transformer has most important sense. Since the general diagnosis methods such as DGA and attributes? reduction of rough set haven?t enough precision for transformer?s fault diagnosis? Extenics and rough set theory are brought into diagnosing the fault of transformer. Using attribute predigesting method in rough set theory to classify the attribute term which needed by each fault diagnosis. Then building matter element model for transformer?s fault diagnosis. Using DGA testing datum to be attribute set and the transformer?s standard fault model to be the decision set for transformer?s fault diagnosis. Utilize association function from Extenics to count each fault degree.

Define the fault accepting rule to get transformer?s fault. Use this method to diagnose one fault transformer and the diagnosis result matched case of fact fault. Apply this method to diagnose 76 DGA testing data and the right ratio of diagnostic result is better than IEC method.

INTRODUCTION  HE transformer is the most important equipment in power system and if it?s fault, the loss of economic  for power system will be very huge. So that operation of transformer is the important factor in reliability of system. The fault diagnosis of transformer for system is always as important scientific research program neither in china nor outside. Now there have so many method to diagnose the fault of transformer, such as DGA method[1-2]. But the information of DGA method isn?t enough to diagnose all of the faults for transformer, and there brings many methods which combined with DGA information such as probability ratiocination, judgment tree, information fuse, Petri network and so on[3-7]. But there always have so much uncalled-for information in the test data, and it may lead research people give out a wrong fault diagnosis result. As this situation, this paper gives out a method which based on matter element  Financial support: Project Supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (90610024?50467002?50347026), Yunnan Science and Technology Project (2003GG10), Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan (2005F0005Z?2004E0020M?2002E0025M)  SHU Hong-chun is with Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming 650051, Yunnan, China.

model and combined with rough set. Use the attribute predigestion method in rough set to predigest the information form test data first, and then build a matter element model by Extenics, use association function of Extenics to calculate the severity of fault, define a rule to assure the fault types of transformer. After use this method the difficulty of diagnosis will be debased and the speed of diagnosis will be enhanced.

? PRINCIPIUM AND FORMULA  A. The principle of Diagnosis with Extenics and Rough Set  Use DGA data to diagnose the fault of transformer is a important research direction in power system, but when in real application there have a problem of that non-code problem happened in the situation of using IEC three-ratio method to diagnose the transformer. This paper use Extenics to diagnose the fault can avoid the non-code problem.

Before the diagnosis, there have so many test data and the fault type of transformer is so many, the data is not corresponding to all the faults and we should predigest it. In this paper we use attribute predigestion method[8] to predigest it. After predigesting the capacity of data will reduce and will not to affect the diagnosis because the core of attributions have been hold in the data. This method will speed up the diagnosis speed and may avoid the wrong diagnosis.

After the attribute predigestion, we build a matter element model for transformer using the attributions, use the capacity of gases which are prescribed in paper[1], use IEC three-ratio method to ratiocinate the capacity of each gas, consult the range of capacity to each gases from other papers, then assure the classical field with matter element model, use association function to calculate the severity of fault then assure the fault type of transformer.

B. The Attribute Predigestion Method of Rough Set Use the difference of reliant degree or the division  of equivalence relation to B and B?. B is the initial attribution set and B? is the subset of B which was educed from the total attribution set D.

)()()( ' DrDrDk BBB ??=        (1)  )( )()( '  Dpos DposDn  B  BB?=           (2)  Suppose that the attribution table is as Table.1, use formula(4) and (5) to predigest the attribution, and then calculate the k1(D) and k2(D) to form new tables of  T  DRPT2008 6-9 April 2008 Nanjing China  978-7-900714-13-8/08/   ?2008DRPT 1269    y?ij(n1) and y?ij(n2). Where n1 and n2 are the number of attribution from y?ij(n1) and y?ij(n2). Define a rule to get new table of Y?ij(n):  if n1>n2 then Y?ij(n)= y?ij(n1) else if n1<n2 then Y?ij(n)= y??ij(n2) else then Y?ij(n)= y??ij(n1) = y?ij(n2)  Do not to see that situation of n1=n2 but each attribution is different, because the two methods are depended on core of attribution table, and the core we defined in the table is the same one, so the predigesting attribution will not affect the diagnosis and the predigest result of attribution is as Table.1.

C. Brief Introduction of Extenics Extenics use matter element model to describe the  research object, and use matter element extension, matter element exchange and other methods to deal with the problems and to get optimization result.

If there is a matter N, the value of its character C is v, and the matter model is as follow:  ???????v?              (3) If the matter N has not only one character, we  describe all the characters in the model:  ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  =  nn vC  vC vCN  R 22  (4)  Define D is the domain, K mapped to U from Real Range, and the set of Extennics from domain U is:  { })(,),(~ ukyUuyuA =?=        (5) Generally the matter element is as:  ?0???0??0?v0?  00 RTR ?=                (6)  And if ?<1, we thought the T is the reduction change to R0, if ??1, T is the enlarge change.

D. The Diagnosis to Transformer The diagnosis process is as follow: (1) Suppose N is the fault matter, if N has fault Ii,  we notes it Ii(N)??i=1,2,?N??and the fault character element set is as follow.

(17)  (7) Assure the coefficient Suppose the fault of Y1, if we get m stylebook of  the fault of Y1, there have sj stylebook which leaded by attribution Xj. So the first coefficient is as:  m s j  j =?                (18)  According to the experience of expert and the knowledge get the modificatory coefficient.

?j  (j=1,2,?ni), where 10??j?1  So that we can get the final coefficient to fault Y1:  ? =  = in  j jj  jj j   ' ??  ?? ?

(22)  Define ?b to be the final fault type, ?m is the first one in the array, and the rule of getting the fault type for transformer is as: if ??m?0 then ?b?0 else if ??m>0 && ?>5% then ?b???m else if ??m>0 && ?<5% then ??b???m && ?b???m-1)  ? CASE STUDY  This paper uses a transformer of 220kV station in Q city of China to be the case, and diagnose it in the method of upper. Consult paper[8-11] and the test data in year 2004 to 2006, build the primary fault set and decision set as Table.2 Use the predigestion method of upper in rough set to predigest the attribution and then the result is as Table.3.

According to ? Guide for the analysis and diagnosis of gases dissolved in transformer oil[S]?, when the content of hydrocarbon over 150?L?L or content of C2H2 over 5?L?L or content of H2 over 150?L?L, should notice the transformer?s situation and analyze its health. This paper use content of C2H2 to be the standard value and get the other contents of gases by IEC three-ratio method[1,9,12]. Use the upper method of diagnosis to diagnose the transformer in case study, and the result is as Table.4.

The IEC result is type 6, the Extenci result is type 8, but the test and examine result is fault 8 in 2006 years of the actual test. We can see that the  Extenics result is right. For proving the rightness of Extenics, get 76 DGA data and applied the method, IEC three-ratio method and paper[9] method to diagnose transformer, the result is as Table.5    DRPT2008 6-9 April 2008 Nanjing China     Table.4 result of fault diagnosis by Extenics  the association degree result time  ??(I1) ??(I2) ??(I3 ??(I4) ??(I5) ??(I6) ??(I7) ??(I8) Extenics IEC  04 1 ?1 -0.25 -0.74 0.23 -0.15 0.47 -0.41 1 1  05 1 -0.36 -0.58 -0.14 -0.78 -0.27 -0.25 -0.18 1 1  06 -0.89 0.68 -0.45 -0.07 0.15 0.54 0.87 1 8 6  The results used of this paper is higher than IEC method and paper[9], Because the method isn?t depend on the number of stylebook, its depend on the boundary  domain in Extenics. And if use this method, the speed of diagnosis is higher than another two methods.
