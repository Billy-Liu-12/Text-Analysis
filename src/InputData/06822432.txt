Service oriented architecture for remote machine  control in ICS

Abstract?Innovative approaches in the field of information technology gets easily inside automation and creates better platform for integration and cooperation of information and control systems (ICS) components. This innovations lead to the ability of ICS for automatic agile reconfiguration, according to market requirements. To implement this ability has become SOA (service orientated architecture) a part of ICS. This paper deals about SOA with the meaning of communication and integration facility in SCADA/HMI (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition / Human? Machine Interface) for remote control through mobile devices. Mobile devices integrate big potential for increasing the agility of ICS and can be involved into SOA. Main contribution is increasing agility of ICS with remote control via mobile devices and SOA.



I. INTRODUCTION This extending step in automation opened the system  for remote control which brings in new automation features. These features created new communication and integration solutions in each level of control system processes.

The spread of information technology has brought in automation mobile devices such as PDAs (Personal Digital Assistant), tablet and smart-phones [1]. The mobile devices are in version, which are designed for industrial environments, too. These devices are intended to increase agile reconfiguration.

Historically one of the last progressive evolutionary steps in remote controlling and in enterprise-wide integration (Enterprise Application Integration) was the Service orientated architecture (SOA). A model of SOA is reusable standard and representation services in enterprise integration [2].

Service Oriented Architecture allows flexibility and low cost [1]. The flexibility of the company is its essential aspects. Increases the competitiveness of the company and the company can sell more their products and increase profits. Therefore, SOA technology allows better response on external and internal conditions [1].

SOA can be applied together with existing systems and allows their interdependence with existing system. For example, SOA might be an existing information systems or as a bridge between two information systems [3].

The benefits of SOA include: ? Independence of the programming language [3].

? Changes of applications and processes don?t stop  functionality of system [3].

? The possibility of rapid implementation of changes  [3].

From a technological perspective, SOA is architecture for the design and applications development. Applications consist of services. Service is a component that has a specified interface. The interface is described via a standardized interface (Web Service Definition Language, or WSDL) [5][6]. Communication is solved by communication protocol SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol). The most common transport channels are HTTP and HTTPS [7].

SOA is closely linked to business processes and for integration in an enterprise or among enterprises [1]. An alternative to SOA for network integration within the business or enterprise is Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM). They both are designed for transparent implementation of function calls between computers over a network. DCOM is designed primarily for Windows, but as the last revolutionary step in SCADA/HMI (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition / Human? Machine Interface) systems is considered SOA. It's a move that enabled the creation of more opened and integrated SCADA/HMI system [8].

The SOA plays important role in collaboration of system?s components of ICS (information and control systems). We consider on applying this collaboration functionality into the part of our ICS system and integration the SOA application server into ICS. This implementation enables to use web services to develop application for mobile devices using SOA and use its advantages and safety benefits in SCADA/HMI systems.

This solution brings innovation in integration application which runs under Windows inside ICS [1].

In this paper, we will be focusing on steps, which lead to implementation of SOA in SCADA/HMI systems. The

III. part describe our solution of implementation SOA to integrate mobile devices on the implementation of client\ server solution. This part is divided into two points, where in the first is described server side (III.A), where server is main part of integration ICS components and leads to implementation of SOA architecture for PC (personal computer), mobile devices and web-browser applications with web service. The second (III.B) describe the client side of our experiment solution.



II. ALTERNATIVES OF IMPLEMENTATIONS MOBILE SCADA/HMI IN INFORMATION AND CONTROL SYSTEMS  SCADA/HMI not only gives information to the human, but they enable humans to control processes and helps human to make good decisions by visualization and increasing safety of humans, data and technological processes. For the SCADA/HMI systems still are searching new ways of implementation, based on the original function of SCADA/HMI, which was designed  SAMI 2014 ? IEEE 12th International Symposium on Applied Machine Intelligence and Informatics ? January 23-25, 2014. ? Herl?any, Slovakia     for PC. SCADA/HMI has expanded its applicability for mobile devices and other alternatives for remote control.

This will streamline production and delivery of information anywhere and anytime. For example, Microsoft Windows CE makes it easier to deploy remote control on various hardware platforms (such as bar code readers) [4].

Software development for mobile devices is expanded with remote control capabilities through mobile devices.

Hand in hand with mobile devices was introduced the SOA technology, which has found his place in mobile devices, too. The using of network makes for SOA big good point to be implemented in ICS system, but also for application in mobile devices. This fusion of SOA, mobile devices help us to realized implementation of this fusion in ICS.

There are also another ways to include mobile devices into ICS system. So we have choice to, select between these solutions of implementation mobile SCADA/HMI.

We consider the advantages and disadvantages of possible implementations, to reach remote control in ICS, which has less network overload, integrate third-party collaboration and allows data visualization, confirmation and correction. We consider these options:  1. HMI server/web browser provides remote access via web browser in mobile device. This option often allows visualized data, but it does not support interaction with data [8]. In case of network failure is HMI disabled.

2. SCADA server/web browser provides remote access via web browser and allows remote confirmation and correction with mobile clients. This option has problem with modular third-party collaboration in ICS and it is sensitive to network failures [8].

3. SCADA server/client mobile devices support remote accessing the server using mobile application. Mobile phone applications accelerate response to and from the SCADA system. In some ways this is better than server/web browser application, for example more computing processes are running on client sides, what by many clients and server applications, decreases server overload [8]. Another advantage is network failure tolerance, opposite others. Remote control can work offline and after reconnection can send requests to server.

In case of network failure is HMI disabled  4. SCADA systems also provide a solution server/thin client. This solution allows the use of any mobile device for remote access to the SCADA system. This solution is simply to implement, but has deficiencies when the application is needed to do application logic in side of mobile device, which is needed to reduce the communication in ICS. In case of network failure is HMI disabled [8].

In our solution we choose the SCADA/HMI server/client mobile devices. This way has best performance for quick delivery, because has less demand on network traffic. Has independent computing sources and do not overload server, in case of many clients. This solution is better due its integration of third party products on server side and network fault tolerance.

For realizing SCADA/HMI server/client mobile devices option we used SOA from .Net Platform named as Windows Communication Foundation (WCF). This gives us another advantage to implement this solution for  controlling and visualizing the technological process on different devices in our ICS like PCs, tablets, mobiles phones (Figure 1.). On the other hand it gives us communication and security advantages in our solution [3].

The mobile devices have been added to support remote  control in our ICS. We implement the remote interface using applications designed for a specific OS (operating system), for mobile devices such as Android, Windows Mobile, Windows Phone or IOS. The disadvantage of these applications is their way of maintenance or making changes. The changes can be time consuming for lot of applications. Due to possibility of changes the server?s functionality. There it is no possibility to add new methods without upgrading the client application.

However, changes can be implemented quickly with the generator. It generates a new file for the client application interface to call methods on the WCF server.



III. WCF SERVER AND MOBILE CLIENT APPLICATION IN REALIZED ARCHITECTURE  We designed architecture of SCADA/HMI, technological tier and database, where we implemented: physical model, Programming Logic Controller (PLC), local network, communication server, database server, application server, mobile client.

Proposal distribution of network components for remote control using SOA and connection on technological tier is shown in Figure2. This architecture has on the base tier physical model. This is used to simulate runtime   Figure 1.  Global architecture of SOA implementation  TABLE I.

To the model is directly connected to PLC. The model  uses digitals and analog inputs, outputs of the PLC. The PLC is executing algorithm of controlling model. The PLC is connected via Ethernet port to the local network.

Other components on the local network are Server and PDA.

The Server is main brain for control model and visualizing data and save dates to the database. The Server consists of three main parts. They are OPC (OLE for Process Control), SQL (Structured Query Language) and WCF. They can be distributed, but for our implementation was more effective to use only one machine. These parts of server will be described in III.A.

The WCF server is acting like application server. It receives requests of all clients. The WCF server is multiuser so the more clients can communicate in the same time, but the user doesn?t have the equal priority.

The user with greater priority can override commands from user with lower priority. The overriding is executing only if the user with higher priority is registered by server as online.

And the last part of this architecture is client. The client side of this architecture is only used to visualize data, control model and configure connection.

Figure 3. shows the solution of WCF server and client oriented applications for SCADA/HMI. Windows forms client application sends requests to the application server, which runs services. Application server executes every request, if the request pass throw security and it is right requested by used server interface. The application server is also connected to the database. The database is used to solve configuration of server and gives some requested configuration to clients. The data are automatically refreshed or inserted with timestamp. The database?s data are used like reporting data of system on web. The secondary purpose of database is keeping actual data of controlled system if the server crashed. Also it gives information about time of crashing, last modification in system and watched system tags.

Used WCF server for realizing this remote control runs services on defined endpoints. It is waiting for the call in the form of requirements. Incoming requests are initialized and composed by the WCF client.  Application  server processes the requirements and start communication with client on defined channel. If the request does not agree with server interface, the request will be refused. Else the server will respond to the client who sent the request.

The client is a mobile device where the application runs  as a WCF client. The application for client is developed like installation application.

A. Server architecture This server provides the service on defined endpoint.

The service has defined methods that process the request with its input parameters.

Form of requirements is already defined in the interface and configuration of service on the server. On the basis of name, input and output parameters can choose the method that executes the programmed algorithm, given by requirement from client.

Requirements are part of most communication with PLCs, for writing and reading data. This implies the needs of integration technological tier through communication with the PLC, through the OPC communication and RSLinx communication software. This WCF service?s interface is extended functionality of WCF server for connection to the technological level. Then this data from technological tier are sending to the WCF client as an output of implemented method on WCF server.

Server can automatically retrieve information about changed data with a period of 500 ms. If there was any value changed, then the class for OPC connection create an event to load a new value for changed tag value. The operator of this event server performs the write values into a common server namespace. This data loading happens dynamically, so the server is readily available to current values obtained from the OPC server without the need for further communication which will slow down retrieving data from technological tier. Therefore, if a client sends a request to WCF server, the server will send the current values on the server, so WCF server sends data that is currently located at a common namespace server application. The event handler is also updated ("update") table data, in which shall be entered all called tags along, with their values and the time when they were last called or when it was found to change the value of the tag in the OPC server.

Data passed via OPC WCF server interface are automatically wrote and updated in MSSQL database. The actual data, which server disposes, are signed on visual side of server.

Figure 3.  Solution for WCF server and client mobile application   Figure 2.  Realized architecture of SOA implementation  SAMI 2014 ? IEEE 12th International Symposium on Applied Machine Intelligence and Informatics ? January 23-25, 2014. ? Herl?any, Slovakia     Server has also visual side for better maintenance and watching actual data.

B. Client architecture  WCF client application is Windows form application and it was developed for mobile devices with Windows Phone.

Client application is used for online controlling of the model. It uses defined communication calls to the service.

The client application has view tier for model and communication, then has logic tier for processing requested and delivered data from WCF server. And the last part is communication tier. This last tier enables integration. Also it uses SOA in this solution and use mobile devices and Wi-Fi in our ICS.

The advantage of clients is its communication reconfiguration to adopt the server communication and logic tier. The modularity of communication tier allows easily adaptation to server configuration and server interface.

The visual part of the client application creates a screen that performs the following functions, which has something with SOA client implementation:  ? Displays the connection status of the devices with WCF server  ? Button to initialize connection, it creates binding to server. This initialization allows user to set IP address of WCF server, where client should be connected. The client can connect to another server by repeating the initialization process.

? Additional functionality which outside the context of article.

The main role of client application is being integrated in WCF. The application is creating connection with WCF server. It uses generated interface of server to set up connection on defined channel and with specified binding.

The IP address is set by default, but it can be changed by user. It is because the interface for this model is written generally for others models or technological systems. The WCF gives requested data to client application. But for whole functionality, WCF server sends states of all tags in one server respond. It is for realizing interactive visualization of technological process. On the other hand the client application transforms the operator?s commands into requests to the service on the WCF server. The  communication with server (after initialization), solve these actions:  ? Reads actual state of technological tier.

? Test connection state.

? Write commands as a request to the server.

Benefit is communication security of messages. Usually  the messages are sends as simple XML, where can be data easily read. WCF gives alternatives to send secured messages by picking the suitable binding.

The remote control is increasingly promoted and with news ways of applying the technologies makes the remote control more convenient and reliable. This implementation of remote control via mobile devices and SOA leads to building easily administration system with easy collaboration and quick innovation ability.
