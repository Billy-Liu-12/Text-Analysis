Performance of the Magnetospheric Multiscale  Central Instrument Data Handling

Abstract-In order to study the fundamental physical processes of magnetic reconnection, particle acceleration and turbulence,  the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission employs a  constellation of four identically configured observatories, each  with a suite of complementary science instruments. Southwest  Research Institute? (SwRI?) developed the Central Instrument  Data Processor (CIDP) to handle the large data volume  associated with these instruments. The CIDP is an integrated  access point between the instruments and the spacecraft. It  provides synchronization pulses, relays telecommands, and  gathers instrument housekeeping telemetry. It collects science  data from the instruments and stores it to a mass memory for  later playback to a ground station.

This paper retrospectively examines the data handling  performance realized by the CIDP implementation. It  elaborates on some of the constraints on the hardware and  software designs and the resulting effects on performance. For  the hardware, it discusses the limitations of the front-end  electronics input/output (I/O) architecture and associated mass  memory buffering. For the software, it discusses the  limitations of the Consultative Committee for Space Data  Systems (CCSDS) File Delivery Protocol (CFDP)  implementation and the data structure choices for file  management. It also describes design changes that improve  data handling performance in newer designs.
