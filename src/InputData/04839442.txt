Abstract?Many studies have been performed to retrieve the sea surface temperature (SST). However, the researchers studied only the effect of brightness temperature difference, observation angle and water vapor content. The sea surface emissivity (SSE) is normally considered as unity or constant. However, in a real case, the sea surface emissivity changes with the wind speed. In this study1 2, we would like to check whether the wind speed had only minimal effect on the sea surface temperature, as was assumed in the prior literature. A new algorithm which included the term of SSE in the function of wind speed was established. The new algorithm was compared with the day split multichannel (MCSST) algorithm. The coefficients of the new algorithm were retrieved by the new derived equation with includes the term of emissivity. The algorithm coefficients of MCSST were retrieved by regression analysis with large amount of SST in-situ data. The SST data simulated by the new algorithm were compared with the SST data simulated with MCSST algorithm. The scatter plot of new derived SST algorithm coefficients was generated. The regression analysis was performed to study the effect of wind speed.

The result showed that only the high wind speed had significant effect on SST retrieval.
