Abstract - The importance of international scientific  collaboration has increased, and this is most marked for China as a rising economy. This paper looks into Chinese international scientific collaboration from co-authorship at the international level by using data of ESI highly cited papers. Special attention is given to collaboration with the established economies. It first introduces the definition of association rules, and then provides the dataset for further analysis. We find that USA is the top one collaborator in China?s highly cited papers; Germany, England, France are China?s top three EU partners; Japan and Australia are top two Asian collaborators. The analyses also suggest that Chinese internationally co-authored papers have a higher citation than its domestic papers. The most collaborated fields with its main partner countries are also explored.

I.  INTRODUCTION   The volume of international scientific collaboration (ISC) has been growing significantly for all countries. It is because it provides access to a wider range of facilities and resources, and also opportunities for researchers to join in leading research communities and to participate in cutting-edge activities and projects [1]. The factors are also divided into internal and external ones: Schott stated internal factors that lagging countries were seeking to cooperate with leading ones [2]; Wagner et al. showed external factors that rising investments by nations and donors had increased science and technology capacity [3].

To analyze the ISC calls for sensitive statistical indicators that can reveal collaborative networks [4].

Bibliometric analysis of co-authored papers turns out to be a promising approach, because many aspects of scientific collaboration networks can be reliably tracked by analyzing co-authorship [5]. Therefore, ISC can be referred from international co-authorship.

Stimulated by the growth of research, China has an increased demand in scientific collaboration with the leading developed countries to move further and faster.

The growth in its international collaboration is remarkable, and can be reflected from international collaborative papers. The relative international collaborative output has increased alongside a massive expansion in volume, and the share of international collaboration has increased more rapidly relative to  domestic volume [6]. According to Adams et al., there was a growth of 2.13 for Chinese international collaborative papers and 2.07 for volume between 1996- 2000 and 2001-2005 [1]. This shows China?s commitment to engagement with international research communities [1].

Many studies have analyzed ISC by using collaborative papers, or in other words, co-authorship.

Melin et al. discussed the relationship between collaboration and co-authorship [4]. Glanzel et al.

analyzed scientific collaboration by using co-authorship both at individual and national level, with special focus on multinational collaborations [5]. Adams et al. also studied international collaboration for the UK based on co- authored papers, and provided reference information for policymakers for the UK?s international engagement in scientific research and development [1]. Guo compared Chinese and Indian international science collaboration patterns based on SCIE co-authored papers [7].

Although many studies have analyzed ISC by using co-authorship, most demonstrate the volume but not the quality. Since citation is an index of excellence, to study the ESI highly cited collaborative papers will reflect the quality of scientific cooperation. Therefore, this paper looks into ESI highly cited papers for People R China, analyzes Chinese international collaborative papers, and its core partners with which the research output is of high quality. Association rules are also introduced in this paper to explore China?s partners and their collaboration frequency.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 explains the characteristics of the association rules. Section 3 provides the dataset retrieved from ESI highly cited paper for Peoples R China. Section 4 presents the results of the analyses. Conclusions are draws in section 5.



II. METHODOLOGY   Association analysis is a methodology for discovering interesting relations between variables hidden in large databases. An association rule is defined as: let I = {i1, i2, ?, in} be a set of all items in a market basket and D = {t1, t2, ?,tm} be a set of transactions. Each transaction in D has a unique TID and contains a subset of items chosen from I. An association rule is an implication of the form X ?Y, where X and Y are disjoint items, i.e., ,X Y I?  and X Y = ??  [8].

Analyzing International Scientific Collaboration Pattern for China by Using ESI Database     Dan XIANG 1, 3, Huaxing LI 2, 3 1 School of Mechanical Engineering, 2 School of Aeronautics, 3 Office of International Cooperation  Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi?an 710072, Shaanxi, China (E-mail: xiangd@nwpu.edu.cn)         The strength of an association rule can be measured by support and confidence. Support is an important measure because a rule that has very low support may occur simply by chance. Therefore, support is often used to eliminate uninteresting rules, and to describe property for the efficiency discovery of association rules [9].

Confidence measures the reliability of the inference made by a rule, and provides an estimate of the conditional probability of Y given X [9]. The support s (X) of an item set X is defined as the proportion of transactions in the dataset which contain the item set, while confidence of a rule is defined c (X?Y) = s (X ? Y)/s (X).

TABLE I EXAMPLE WITH 4 ITEMS AND 5 TRANSACTIONS   TID milk bread butter egg  1 1 1 0 0 2 0 0 1 0 3 0 0 0 1 4 1 1 1 0 5 0 1 0 0   Table I is a simple example to illustrate the concept  from the market basket data. The set of items is I=?milk, bread, butter, egg?. 1 codes are presence and 0 absence of an item in a transaction.

Consider the rule?milk, bread?? butter. Since the support count for?milk, bread, butter?is 1, and the total number of transaction is 5, the rule?s support is 1/5=0.2.

The rule?s confidence is obtained by dividing the support  count for?milk, bread, butter?by the support count for ? milk, bread? . Since there are 2 transactions that contain milk and bread, the confidence for the rule is 1/2=0.5. It means that if milk and bread are bought, customers also buy butter.

Python Programming Language has been applied to analyze the collaborative frequency between countries by using the methodology of association analysis.



III. DATASET   The original data was retrieved from ESI highly cited papers for Peoples R China, updated on September 1, 2011 covering a 10-year plus 8-month period, from January 1, 2001 to August 31, 2011. There were 5,102 papers included as highly cited papers published by Peoples R China upon the information retrieval time. The top 2000 were selected to be analyzed in this paper, in which 991 were internationally co-authored papers.

The information for each paper provided by ESI is citation, title, authors, source, authors? addresses, and field. Since this paper explores the international collaborative pattern for China, country who collaborates with China is the core indicator. Addresses, showing author?s working organization and country, make it possible to collect China?s partner countries for each paper. Therefore, the data analyzed in this paper are records of citation, authors? location country, and field, as shown in Table II.

IV. ANALYSES AND RESULTS  A.  International Scientific Collaboration Network for China   This part analyzes Chinese ego-centric network for  ISC [10]. In other words, the dataset is Chinese 991 internationally co-authored papers, and the co-authored papers between other countries are the subset of the Chinese internationally co-authored papers. Association analysis is applied to analyze the frequency of collaboration between the countries. Python Programming Language has been used to realize the analyses and the results.

Among Chinese 991 internationally co-authored papers, a total number of 91 countries are collaborating  with China. Table III lists Chinese ISC matrix according to the number of co-authored papers. As is shown in Table III, the figures represent the number of co-authored papers. The first row and the first column is the number of co-authored papers between China and its partner countries, and the other figures are the collaboration frequency between other courtiers of the subset.

It is clear that China collaborates most with the USA as expected (64.58% of China?s total) in the highly cited papers. China also collaborates much more with Germany (21.19%) and England (17.66%) than other EU countries.

The frequency of collaboration in highly cited papers with Japan ranks five in the world enabled by geography, and top in Asia.

Chinese ISC Network     Based on the statistics analyzed in Table III, the Chinese ISC network is drawn by using Netdraw software [11]. Nodes are the 92 countries including China, and links are collaborations between these countries. The larger the node, more collaboration is involved; more links also represent higher frequency of collaboration. Fig 1 shows that the USA has the largest node as Chinese dominant partner, and then Germany, England, Japan, France and Australia.

B.  Chinese Bilateral Collaboration Network  China has 33 bilateral collaborators with an output of  589 co-authored papers. As shown in Table IV, China also collaborates most with USA (30.98%) in bilateral ties, which is 7.48 times more than Australia (4.14%), China?s second largest bilateral partner. The choices of partners are likely to be linked to both opportunity and research quality [6].The USA is ahead of other countries in terms of research excellence, and has the potential to  Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE IEEM       increase the research value for its partners [1]. Therefore, as expected, the USA is attractive for Chinese researchers, and their collaboration results in both volume and quality.

Table IV also indicates that China collaborates more in chemistry with the USA and Japan, materials science with Germany and Singapore, physics with Canada and Sweden, and clinical medicine with England and Netherlands in highly cited papers.

This is the same case that nodes represent countries and links are collaboration. The USA is on the end of the largest node, and has the thickest link to China.

Fig .2. Network of Chinese Bilateral Collaboration   C. A Higher Citation of Co-authored Papers   Narin et al. found that internationally co-authored  articles were more highly cited than other articles [12].

The same result can be drawn from the data in this paper.

The top highly cited paper for China with a citation of 5860, is co-authored with seven other countries by 244 authors; The top ten highly cited papers for China are all international collaborative papers; Among the top 100,  international output takes 68%, 2.125 times more than the Chinese domestic papers. Table V shows the evidence that the citation per paper of Chinese internationally co- authored papers is higher than Chinese domestic papers.

The citation per paper for international papers is 226, while the Chinese domestic papers have an average citation of 180.

V. CONCLUSION   This paper has introduced the association rules for Chinese ISC analysis. With the dataset gathered from ESI highly cited papers for China, we have constructed Chinese ISC matrix, ISC network, and bilateral network by using Python Programming Language and Netdraw software. Outcomes of the analyses tell us that China has a diverse range of links, especially with the USA, Germany, England, France, Japan, and Australia, and the USA is a strongly dominant partner for China both in volume and research quality.

For future research, we plan to collect more records of ESI highly cited papers in 22 fields, and analyze the fields of collaboration with China?s main partners, which may provide reference to Chinese researchers to choose their partners in their research field.
