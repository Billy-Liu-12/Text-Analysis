Data Stream Clustering Algorithm Based On Active Grid Density

Abstract?CluStream is a representative data stream cluster algorithm; however, it is not able to find arbitrary clusters in shape and deal with boundary points effectively. A new algorithm which is based on active grid density AGD-Stream is proposed to solve these problems in this paper. The algorithm adopts a density decaying technology to capture the dynamic of data stream, and extracts the boundary point of grid to delete.

Besides, this paper uses activity concept to judge activity of the grid density, neglecting the inactive grid density and preserving the active gird density for clustering. Experiment shows that AGD-Stream can not only find arbitrary clusters in shape, but also deal with boundary points. Compared with CluStream, AGD-Stream is better in time complexity and accuracy.

I. INTRODUCTION With the development of information technology,  people's lives are flooded with more and more data in the form of streams every day. As the data streams have the characteristics of continuity, potentially infinite, high mobility etc [1], making the data stream mining algorithm can only be examined in sequence, one pass or a limited time [2]. So, the traditional mining methods are difficult to meet its need in the limited time. In the recent study, the data stream clustering algorithm has been attracting the attention of many domestic and foreign researchers, proposing a lot of algorithms. Initially, L.O ?Callaghan [3-5] et al proposed several clustering algorithms of data stream, which can not express the dynamic for data stream. In 2003, a popular data stream clustering algorithm CluStream[6] was proposed by Aggarwal. The algorithm uses a two-tier online/offline framework for data streams clustering.

According to the pyramid time frame structure to store the summary statistics of micro-cluster for the macro cluster.

The drawback of CluStream is: It can only recognize the spherical clusters, but not reveal clusters of arbitrary shapes; it can not handle the boundary points, and clustering accuracy is low.

Recently, some other algorithms such as ACluStream[7], DenStream[8], D-Stream[9]and the RTCS[10] are supposed.

These algorithms can identify the arbitrary clusters in shape, however, the time complexities of clustering are a little high, leading to the low efficiency of these algorithms; besides, some effective data points were recorded as a  boundary point in error and delete in the process of clustering. So, these algorithms can neither deal with the problem of boundary points better, nor solve the shortage of CluStream effectively.

In order to solve above problems, a new algorithm for clustering stream data is proposed,(Data stream clustering algorithm based on active grid density, AGD-Stream) it can not only find clusters of arbitrary shapes, but also deal with the problem of boundary points effectively. First, the data space grid is divided into a grid structure which is formed by a number of small cube grids, then the data stream is mapped to this structure, applying the concept of density to form the concept of grid density. And, the algorithm adopts a density decaying technology to capture the dynamic of data stream, and extracts the boundary point of grid to delete. To use concept of activity to judge active of the grid density, neglecting the inactive grid density and preserving the active gird density for clustering. Experiment shows that AGD-Stream is better than CluStream in time complexity and accuracy.



II.  BASIC DEFINITIONS In this paper, we need to do the following work for the  demand of grid division: Assume that the input data has n dimensions, and each input data record is defined in the space R: 1 2 nR R R R= ? ? ? , where iR  is the definition space for the ith dimension. Now, we partition the n dimensional space R into certain spatial grids. Suppose for each dimension, its ith dimension space iR (i = 1, 2, 3? n) is divided into ir  partitions ( ,1) ( ,2) ( , )ii i i i rR R R R= ? ? .Then the grid made up by data space R is partitioned into   n ii  N r =  = ?  grids. For a arbitrary density grid g that is composed of  1 21, 2, , nj j n j R R R? ? ? , (  ij =1,?, ir ) we denote  it as g=(j1, j2?,jn).If being a data record { }1, , nX x x= ,we map it to a partitioned density grid g as follows: g(x)=(j1, j2?,jn),where ( , ii i jx R? ).

Definition 2.1 (Density weight).Suppose x is a data record of data stream, then the density weight for x  is a function which changes with time t:  ( )( , ) ct t t T xD x t ? ?? ?= =   (1)   DOI 10.1109/ICICSE.2010.12    DOI 10.1109/ICICSE.2010.12     Where )1,0(?? is a constant, called the decay factor, ct is the time that x arrives, ( )T x is its time stamp, ct = ( )T x .

In general speaking, density weight describes the effect degree of data record x on clustering at time t. Initial density weight for a new data is 1, and it is index decaying with the time increasing. Actually, the time stamp for any data ix of data records { }1, , nX x x= can be expressed by ( )iT x .

Theorem 2.1 Suppose ( )X t is the set of all data records that arrive from 0 to t, then the sum of density weight of all data records meets:  ( )  1lim ( , ) 1t x x t  D x t ??? ?  = ??   (2)  Proof Let all data records that arrive from 0 to t in X (t) are 1, 2, , tx x x , where ix arrives at the ith time. Their  density weight is 1 1, , ,1t? ??  respectively at the time t, and  their sum is:  ( ) 0  ( , ) (1 ) (1 ) t  n t  x X t n  D x t ? ? ? ?  ? =  = = ? ?? ?  when t ? ?  lim((1 ) (1 )) 1 (1 )t t  ? ? ? ??  ? ? = ? .

Definition 2.2 (Activity) The activity is defined as the  degree that grid accepts the new arrived data at some time section  Definition 2.3 (Grid Density) For a grid g, at a given time t, any data record ix of data records { }1 , , nX x x= has a density weight ( , )iD x t ,so the grid density is defined as the sum of all density weights at or before t:  ( , ) ( , )  n  i i  D g t D x t =  =?   (3)  Theorem 2.2 Suppose a grid g receives a new data record at time nt , and suppose the time when g receives the last data record is lt ( nt > lt ), then the density of g can be updated as follows:  n  0, ( , )  ( , ) 1,n l n l  t t l  t t D g t  D g t? ? ? >>?= ? +??  ot her (4)  Proof Let { }1,..., mX x x= be the set of all data records in g at time lt , x is a new arrived data at nt , we have:   ( , ) ( , ) m  l i l i  D g t D x t =  =?   (5)  According to (1), we have that:  ( ) ( )( , )  ( , ), ( 1, , )  n i n l l i  n l  t T x t t t T x i n  t t i l  D x t  D x t i m  ? ? ? ?  ? ? ?  ?  = =  = = (6)  Therefore, we have:       ( , ) ( , ) ( , )  ( , ) ( , )  ( , )  ( , ) 1  ( , ) 1  ( , ) 1  n l  n l n n  n l  n l  n l  m  n i l n i  m t t  i l n i  m t t t t  i l i  m t t  i l i  m t t  i l i  t t l  D g t D x t D x t  D x t D x t  D x t  D x t  D x t  D g t  ?  ? ?  ?  ?  ?  =  ?  =  ? ?  =  ?  =  ?  =  ?  = +  = +  = +  = +  = +  = +  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  (7)  The definition 2.2 and definition2.3 show that, with the time increasing infinitely, if the data does not arrive at a grid, then we can say this grid has lower grid activity, and its grid density will decay gradually. Moreover, the previous data in grid can not affect the following clustering, so we can record its grid density as 0; Relatively, if the data always arrive at a grid, then this grid has higher grid activity. In the process of clustering data streams, the grid density of a grid with high activity is called the active grid density. In order to meet the characteristics of the data stream and save memory space, we only need a higher activity grid to process clustering  Definition 2.4 (Dense grid and sparse grid) Let mC be the threshold for dense grid, lC be the threshold of sparse  grid, lt be the last data received.

(1) if ( , )n mD g t C? ,then we call it a dense grid.

(2) if ( , )n lD g t C?  and ln tt >> ,then we call it a sparse grid.

(3) if ( , )l n mC D g t C? ? ,then we call it a transitional grid  To some grid, if the data does not arrive at a grid for a long time, leading to the number of data in the grid is very small, the impact of the history data on data clustering is negligible, we call such grid a sparse grid. Relatively if the data in the grid grows to a certain quantity, we call the grid a dense grid. A dense grid may degenerate to a transitional or sparse grid if it does not receive new data for a long time.

On the other hand, a sparse grid can upgrade to a transitional or dense grid after it receives some new data records [10].

By definition 2.4, the density of the grid will change over time. Therefore, after a period of time, the density of     each grid should be inspected and the clusters should be adjusted. Using gap to express the time interval, we use [9] definition of the gap :  } }{  2 2   min log , log  log (max , )  l m  m l  l m  m l  c N cgap c N c  c N c c N c  ? ?? ? ? ?= ?? ? ? ??? ? ? ?? ? ??= ? ??? ?  (8)  where, N represents the number of grid.

Definition2.5 (Eigenvector) The eigenvector of a grid g  is a tuple , , ,g l mV G D t t< > ,where G is coordinates of grid centre, mt is the last time when g is updated, lt is the last time when g is removed from grid list as a sporadic grid(if ever),  gD is the grid density at the last time.

Definition 2.6 (Boundary point) [10] A boundary point is a  data object that meets the following two conditions: (1) It is located in the edge of dense data points; (2) It has two or more characteristics of clustering

III. DATA STREAM CLUSTERING ALGORITHM BASED ON ACTIVE GRID DENSITY  A. Basica Idea The basic idea of AGD-Stream is: First of all, the data  space grid should be divided into a grid structure which is formed by a number of small cube grid, and data stream is mapped to this structure; Then, apply the concept of density to form the concept of grid density, judge the grid density according to eigenvector; and use technology of density decay to capture dynamics of data stream, then extract the boundary point of grid to delete. Besides, this paper uses the concept of activity to judge the activity of the grid density: 1) if the grid density is inactive, it means that there are not new dataset arrive at some time, then it presents the sparse grid, we need neglect.2) if the grid density is active, it means that there are new dataset arrive at some time, then it presents the dense grid, so we keep it for clustering at last.

if ( ix  is on the edge) and (t mod gap <> 0) for (i=0, i<=n, i++) switch ( ix ) {case ?not on the edge?: judge the active of grid density; update (V); break; //If the grid density is not active, it means the grid not has new data arrives; and the grid will become a sparse grid or transitional grid so that it will be deleted.

case ?on the edge?: inspect grid density and update (V); break; // judge if it meets another condition of boundary point.} else Update (grid); // otherwise updated grid to adapt to the new distribution of data stream if (density (g)) // if g is active grid density, add it to the grid_ list.

Insert g into grid_list; if (t mod gap==0) //  Cluster (grid); }

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS Experimental environment: Intel Pentium 4, CPU  3.00GHz, 1.00GB memory, Windows XP Operating System, using MATLAB to compile. The tested set is a real data set used by the KDD CUP-99. It contains network intrusion detection stream data collected by the MIT Lincoln laboratory. This data set contains a total of five clusters and each connection record contains 42 attributes. As in [6], all the 34 continuous attributes are used for clustering; In all the experiment, let mC =3.5, lC =0.9, ?=0.9 .

A. Time Complexity Analysis The time complexity of algorithm can truly reflect its  efficiency. In this experiment, we use KDDCUP99 data sets to compare and analyze AGD-Stream and CluStream on the time complexity. The results shown in Figure 2    5 10 15 20 25 30  Length of Stream(k)  R un  ni ng  T im  e( s)  AGD-Stream CluStream     Figure 2 Comparison of time complexity     It can be seen from Figure 2, with the increasing length of the data stream, both of the algorithms have a linear increasing trend. But the time CluStream spent is much more than the AGD-Stream spent significantly and CluStream takes three to four times more clustering time than AGD-Stream takes. For example, when the length is 15, both the algorithms corresponding time points approach to 2s, 6s, respectively. This shows that the time complexity of AGD-Stream on clustering is significantly lower than CluStream, which also reflects that the AGD-Stream has more efficient.

B. Clustering Accuracy Analysis AGD-Stream still use KDDCUP99 data sets to com-  pare its accuracy with CluStream. The data sets are divided into three classes: len=0.02, len=0.04, len=0.05.The results are shown in Figure 3-1, 3-2.

In Figure 3, len indicates the size of each partitioned segment in the normalized dimensions. For example, when len = 0.02, there are 50 segments in each dimension. Both the Figures show that the average clustering accuracy of AGD-Stream is higher than CluStream?s, and the highest percent of AGD-Stream is 99%;while CluStream?s is 98.7%.When len=0.02,the average accuracy of AGD- Stream is 98%,higher than 97.6% of CluStream and when len=0.05, the clustering accuracy of AGD-Stream is 0.2% higher than CluStream Besides, we can see that: Neither dividing grid more fine ,more better, nor too tough. If some grid is divided too fine, it is much easier to part the data in the same cluster into other clusters, resulting in lower clustering accuracy. While, if it is too tough, it will lead some     Figure 3-1 Clustering accuracy of CluStream      Figure 3-2 Clustering accuracy of AGD-Stream data in different clusters into same cluster, and it also results in lower clustering accuracy.
