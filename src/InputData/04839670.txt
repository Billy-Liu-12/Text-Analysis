One of many issues encountered by engine experts when reading measurements is that a given engine never works under exactly the same conditions. However, a practical abnormality detector must be able to check for failures in any possible context. Maintaining a monitoring application is expensive and one never wants to build specific computations for each flight phases and external conditions.

The purpose of this article is to present a normalization pretreatment which leads to the conception of standardized signatures. Those signatures continue to carry a clear meaning for experts but are independent of flight conditions.

With such a data pretreatment a classification of failures becomes possible and may be interpreted in physical terms by engineers. This will help to produce a degradation identification solution and adapt maintenance workflows.
