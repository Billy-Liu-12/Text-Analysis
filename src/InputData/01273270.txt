A Taxonomy-based Approach to Determining. Generic  Interestingness of Association Rules% ?

Abstract- Items are related to each other either because of the generic category to whichzthey belong or due to their usage contexts. We describe four notions of item- relatedness based on relationships existing between them using a taxonomy. We combine two of them to get a new measure of item relatedness. We compare and contrast this measure? with a traditional taxonomy-based similarity measure. Interestingness of an association rule is then inversely proportional to the least-related item pair in the rule.



I. INTRODUCTION Association Rule mining, an important area of Data Mining, is concemed with the detection of implicit pattems in large database of transactions on the basis of the co-occurrence between items. In the retail market-basket context, association rules inform a user ahout the items that are likely to be purchased together by a customer in a purchase transaction. Association rule discovery methods are highly automated. A large number of rules are generated. A user perusing these rules will be unable to get an overview of the domain. Also, most rules are obvious to the user. It is manually impossible to inspect the rules and select the most relevant ones. Therefore, automated methods that select the most relevant and interesting mles are needed.

Interestingness measures [6, 81 quantify the amount of ?interest? that a rule is expected to evoke in a user examining it. Interestingness measures are classified into two classes viz. objective and subjective. Objective measures [E] use the structure of a pattem and the data generating process to quantify its interestingness. Subjective measures [6], in addition, incorporate the views of the user who inspects it. Silberschatz and Tuzhilin [6] identify two aspects that characterize subjective interestingness, viz.

unexpectedness and actionability. Most studies use unexpectedness to operationalize subjective interestingness.

This is done b y  evaluating rules against user-beliefs. The interestingness of a rule is directly proportional to its deviation from user beliefs.

0-7803-7651-X1031$17.000 2003 IEEE  Here, we look at ?interestingness? in a slightly different fashion. Items in an association rule might be related to each other to various degrees because of relationships between them. These relationships might be a result of their primary functionalities, .secondary functionalities and usage contexts. Stronger and larger numbers of relationships imply strong relatedness. Normally we expect strongly related items to occur together in an association rule.

However, if an association rule contains unrelated or weakly related item pairs, then this occurrence tends to surprise a user. This is because large occurrences of such item combinations are unexpected. Our approach consists of using the domain knowledge of users to express relationships between items (available for sale in a retail market) in a taxonomy of items. We then utilize the structural aspects of the taxonomy tree to comment on the ?relatedness? hetwcen item pairs occurring in the mined association,rules. An item-pair is more ?interesting? if the items are less related to each other and vice-versa. The least related item pair in a rule drives the interestingness of the entire rule.

Taxonomies have been used in data mining studies to find associations between items at different levels of the taxonomy tree [4], to mine negative associations [7] and in attribute-oriented generalization [3]. Hamilton and others [3] used taxonomies to rank generalized relations on basis.

of interestingness. However, they construct taxonomies for individual attributes, but do not consider relationships that exist between the attributes. Here, we do not deal with attribute values explicitly, but consider the relationships between two items based on their positions in the taxonomy tree. Basu, et al. [2] used WordNet, a lexical knowledge- base of English words to evaluate novelty of tcxt-mined rules. Our approach is similar to the approach adopted by Basu, et al. However, they do not consider certain categories of relatedness characteristic to our context.

TENCON 2003 /704  2. INTUITIVE NOTIONS OF ITEM RELATEDNESS.

A taxonomy is a tree that brings out the relationships hetween various items and their categories on the hasis of their attributes. The relationships depicted are ?is-a? type of relationships. Items that have similar or closely related attributes occur close to each other in the taxonomy as they tend to belong to the same broad category. The categorization process creates two types of divisions in a taxonomy. The first one is related to the number of values each attribute can take thus controlling the ?widthibreadth? of the taxonomy. The second division concerns the number of attributes that a domain expert may use to describe a category. Although, a large number of attributes need not necessarily imply greater depth, the clarity of classification could greatly improve if greater depth is imparted to the taxonomy. The description of a category (concept) then becomes more ?specific?. Together, these two types of divisions define the complexity of the taxonomy. We cannot expect a domain expert to have complete knowledge about hisher domain. In some sense, a taxonomy is always incomplete with respect to the knowledge it represents. We can have two taxonomies that represent the same set of items. However, they might describe the items to varying levels of detail. This description.depends on the number of relationships captured by each taxonomy. We can use the structure of a taxonomy, i.e. the positions of ?items? and the various categories connecting them to comment on the ?relatedness? between items. We make use of graph- theoretic terms freely. Unless specified, the terms are standard.

2. I Node Separation Reloredness (NSR)  A path that connects two leaf-level items or nodes consists of category nodes that lie in the traversal between them. The conceptual separation of these two ?items? in the concept hierarchy can he the length of the ?path? connecting the two items. The path connecting the two items includes various category nodes that divide the domain according to the attributes of the items. Some of these attributes might be specific to one of the. two items. Occurrence of such attributes instantiated specifically on one of the two items would reduce ?rclatedness?. A longer path has a greater likelihood of containing such ?category? nodes?specific to one of the two .items. Therefore, relatedness between two items decreases as the length of path increases and consequently ?interestingness? increases. The first notion of item relatedness. called node separation relatedness (NSR), is the length of the simple path (in terms of the number of nodes) connecting the two leaf-level items, A and B.

I  NSR (A,B) = Lp(A,.B)  Traditionally, in semantic nets representing natural language and othcr graph-based representation schemes, the semantic distance between two words is defined as the length of the shortest path that connects the two words. This is defined in  terms of  the number of edges. Except for the use of nodes instead of edges, the first notion of relatedness is similar to that employed in traditional literature. Path length can he defined either in terms of nodes or in terms of  edges. As the number of nodes in a path is one less than the numhcr of edges, both the definitions are equivalent.

2.2 Highest Level Node Relaredness (HR)  A path connecting any two items in the taxonomy-tree consists of a number of nodes. Of these, one node, called the highest-level node (HP) plays a significant role in determining relatedness between the two items. The highest-level node is the lowest co,mmon ancestor for both the items. The closer the highest level node, HP, is to the root node greater is the degree of separation between the items and lower the relatedness. ?Fundamental? (or basic) attributes are used for categorization at higher levels near the root nodes, while at lower levels categorization is by attributes that are more fine-grained and maybe specific to a category. As a consequence of this kind of taxonomy construction, two siblings at a lower level of  the taxonomy tree will he similar to each?other to a greater extent than two siblings at a higher level of the concept hierarchy i.e. closer to the ?root node. Further, the HP is the closest common ancestor node for both items. If HP is at a lower level, a large number of attributes will be common to both the items (attributes specific to categories that belong to the path from HP to root node of  the tree). This increases the relatedness between items. The second notion of item relatedness called Highest level Node Relatedness (HR) for two items A and B is defined as the level of the highest level node of the path(A,B) connecting the two items.

HR (A,B) =Level  I HP(A,B) I  We note that relatedness between two items increases with an increase in the value of HR and decreases with an increase in the value of NSR. These two notions can be combined as follows:  The factor ? I ?  takes into account the case wherein the root node happens to he the lowest common ancestor. It can easily he shown that the maximum relatedness between any two items in a taxonomy of depth ?K? is equal to K.

Therefore, ?K? is used as the normalization factor. The measure given by equation I ,  is similar to the traditional hierarchy-based measure given as equation 2 [ 5 ] .

2 * HR(A, B) depth(A) + deprh(B)  Sim-Trad =  where, depth(A) and depth(B) are the depths (in terms of edges) at which the items A and B occur in the taxonomy.

Web Technology and Data Mining /705  Figure 1. A Partial Taxonomffor a retail Stole  Although, ltem-Relulednes~ and Sim-Trad appear to be similar .there are some differences between the two.

Conceptually, Sim-Trud measure can be viewed as the ratio of the number of concepts common to the two items to the total number of concepts instantiated by the?two items. On the other hand, Item-Relatedness is the ratio of the number of concepts common to the two items, to the number of concepts different across the two items. Therefore, it is a ratio of the commonality to the differences between the two items. In the case of Item-Relatedness measure, an increase in the commonality will directly increase its value (given a fixed difference) in direct proportion. On the other hand in case of Sim-Trud, increase in value is not in direct proportion to the increase in commonality.

Another point of differcnce is regarding how the two measures treat the case when the root node happens to be the least common ancestor ofthe two item nodes. Sim-Trad directly takes a value of zero since the level of the root node is 0. This medns that any two leaf-level items, even if connected by paths of varying lengths, will always have a value of Sin-Trud equal to 0. This docs not correspond to intuition, as wc know that paths of different lengths mean different levels of similarities. Also, thcre is at least a small degree of similarity between two items even though they may be far away from each other. On the other hand, //em-Relatedness is more intuitive as it does not assign a value of  zero but gives a very low value ofrelatedness. This depends on the length of the path connecting the two items.

A longer path will lead to lower relatedness. Finally,  Sim-Trad is not normalized and therefore cannot tie used to compare relatedness between items in two different taxonomies. Item-Relatedness can give some idea of the relative relatedness because of the normalization factor.

Figure I depicts a sample taxonomy and Table I gives the computed values of item relatedness measures for some sample item pairs.

2.3 Level-Imbalance Relatedness (LR)  Items can occur as leaf nodes at different levels in a concept hierarchy tree. A lower level item has larger number of ?instantiated attributes? going into the description of the category it belongs to. By ?instantiated attributes? we mean? the attributes that are peculiar to a category and whose values go into defining the item under the category. On the other hand, a higher-level item is sufficiently described by fewer attribute instantiations. A rule relating an ?item? from a ?higher-level? category to a *Iower-level? category would be more interesting because it would be connecting a ?general? item to a ?particular? item; generality being defined by lesser number of attribute instantiations. We would be interested in knowing why not to the sibling of the ?particular? item, which is sufficiently similar to the Iower- level item. We try to capture this aspect of relatedness, by a third measure called level imbalance relatedness (ER). LR is simply the difference in the levels of the two items.

Therefore,.

LR(A, B) = I level(A) - level(B) I    TENCON 2003./ 706  Table 1. Item Rclatedness between some sample item pairs  I  The larger the differcnce, the lower is the relatedness and consequently higher the interestingness. Another interesting point that concerns an item-pair that has a sufficiently high LR is the fact that there are usually more choices available to a user in the domain of thc lower-level item than the domain of the higher-level item.

: 2.4 Density Relatedness (DR)  In a taxonomy tree, different categories are instantiated by different number? of attributes. While in one case five anributcs might sufficiently describe the functionality of a ca tegoj ,  in another, one may require ten or more. Also, cach attribute can take different values from its range.

Therefore,?different portions of a taxonomy are not equally ?dense? with. respect to ?categories? and ?sub-categories?, If a path connecting two items lies in a ?dense? area of the concept hierarchy, then that path will be connecting two items whose functionality is specified by more number of instantiated altributes. This connection is particularly interesting because there is a lot of choice available in the ?dense?.part of the concept hierarchy. If a category is monopolizcd, by very few items, a customer does not have choices. This ,introduces sparseness. A connection between any two items in a sparsely populated part of the concept hierarchy would not be a s  interesting because a cusomer would be forced to purchase the available items due to the absence of choices. Whereas we would be interested in knowing why a specific connection between items takes place in the densely populated portion of the tree and not with respect to the siblings of the items. Wc capture this aspect by a measure called ?density relatedness? (DR), which in a?sense, measures the relevant choices available for a customer?s purchase. To calculate DR(A, B), we note the number of children of,each node belonging to path(A, B) and sum them up. This gives us a measure of ?denseness? of that part )f the concept hierarchy where the path lies. .

Thus,  DR(A,B) =zlchildrenofA, X?pa lh(A ,  B)  This notion is similar to the notion of conceptual density developed by Agirre and Rigua [ I ] ,  where they note that concepts that are in a denser part of a taxonomy are relatively closer than those in a sparser region. However, here we use the notion of density in a different sense. We note that more product variants are available in a denser part of the taxonomy. Therefore, an item pair connecting two items in a denser part of the taxonomy tends to be?more interesting due to the specific connection among all the possible connections.

3. D~SCUSSIONS Table 1 shows the item relatedness measures calculated for sample item pairs specified by the taxonomy given in Figure 1. We highlight the important features here. The first point to be noted is that both Item-Relatedness and Sim-Trad rank the relatedness between item pairs in a similar way i.e.

the relative rankings are more or less the same. Sim-Trad assigns a value of 0 to the first five item pairs because the root node happens to be the lowest common ancestor for these item pain. However, Item-Relatedness assigns low values of relatedness depending 011 their path lengths. This is more intuitive, as we see that all the items are household items, which means that they are related in some way or the other although to a small extent. Notice that in item pairs 6 and 7, Item-Relatedness values are much lower than the values assigned by Sim-Trad. This is because of the normalization factor that is prcsent in ItemiRclateness. We also note Itcm-Relatedness assigns the maximum possiblc value I to the pair (Orange SoJi Drink, Lemon Sofr Drink] This pair has the ?strongest relatedness in the entire taxonomy.

NSR and HR are relatedness at a more basic level than LR and DR. Therefore, we can look at relatedness from two levels. initially, we can use the Item-Relatedness values to rank?item pairs. Then, Level Imbalance and Density Relatedness values are useful for comparing those item, pairs that have equal or nearly the same values of Item-Relatedness or Sim-Trad. It is not appropriate to use    Web Technology and Data Mining /707 the LR and DR measures in isolation. Considcr the item pairs 2 and 3 in Table I .  They have equal values for all relatedness measures except for Level Relatedness. The item pair {Cake, Liquid Soap) is slightly more interesting than { Whire Bread, Shampoo) because Cake which is at a higher level in the taxonomy is related to a very specific item viz. Liquid Soap. This is brought out by the level relatedness measure. Finally, we note that association rules contain morc than one item pair. Therefore, while considering the interestingness of a rule we have to consider the relatedness of all item pairs. The interestingness of an association rule can then be said to be inversely proportional to the relatedness of the ?least-related? item pair of the rule.

4. S U M M A R ~ Knowledge discovery in databases aims at discovering unknown, relevant and significant knowledge from large databases. However, in association rule mining, automated methods for discovering the most interesting and relevant rules, are nccessary because association ru le  mining algorithms typically tend to? discover a large number of rulcs. The numbers are too large for easy human comprehension. Further, most of the discovered rules are obvious to the user due to hisiher domain knowledge.

In this paper, we have described a knowledge-based approach to dctermining generic interestingness of association rules. Items sold at a retail outlet are inter- related to various extents due to their primary and secondary functionalities and usage contexts. We use a knowledge taxonomy to depict the is-a relationships between the items and their categories. Structural aspects of this taxonomy are used to describe four intuitive notions of item relatedness. Two of thesc notions, viz. Node Separation relatedness and Highest-level node relatedness are combined to obtain a quantitative measure of relatedness i.e. Item-Relatedness. We have compared this with a traditional similarity measure viz. Sim-Trad [ 5 ] .

The other two notions viz. density relatedness and level- imbalance relatedness can be used to further discem item pairs having near equal values of Item-Relatedness. In general, association rules can contain many items. We then need to consider the relatedness values of all item pairs. A rule?s least related itcm-pair is its most interesting one. We can usc this pair to represent the rule. The least-related item- pair is identified for all rules. Then, association rules are ranked according to an increasing order of 1lem~ReIatedne.w  Interestingness and item rclatedness are opposing notions.

The presence of unrelated and weakly related item-pairs in a rule helps in determining interestingness of rules (both  qualitative and quantitative). We have attempted to identify and quantify this presence.
