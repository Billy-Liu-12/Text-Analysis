I. INTRODUCTION  Findingtheassociationruleisoneofthemosttargetsof  datamining,itsgoalisdiscovering allfrequentpatternsand  strong association rules in the data set. At present it has  widely applied in the network advertisement cheat, the  commodity shelf layout, the traffic accident analysis, the  insurancebusiness,disease forecasts, teachingappraisaland  so on. Now ripe mining  association rule algorithms are  about BOOLEAN data[5,6], in fact there are lots of  quantative attributes in the database.Quantitative attributes  must be divided several disperse intervals when mining  association rules. It maybe bring the incisive boundary  problem.Inordertosolvethisproblemsomedomesticand  foreign scholars introdued the fuzzyset concept into fuzzy  association rule  algorithms[1,712].The common fuzzy  association rule mining algorithms are all based on the  Apriori algorithm. This kind of algorithmmainly uses the  candidate itemof collecting  filteringmethod, thus itmust    costthemassivetimeandthestoragespacewhenprocessing  thehuge scalecandidateitems,simultaneously itmustscans  thedatabasemanytimes.

II. FUZZYASSOCIATIONRULES  Let { }nTTTT ,,, 21 L = beadatabaseoftransactions?each  transaction Tj represents the jth tuple in T. We use  { }m21 I,,, LIII = torepresentallattributes(items)thatappear  in T? each attribute Ik may have a binary, categorical or  quantitative underlying domain Dik . Besides, each  quantitativeattributeIkisassociatedwithat leasttwofuzzy  sets. Explicitly, it is possible to define some fuzzy sets for  attribute ikwith amembership functionper fuzzy set such  thateachvalueofattributeIkqualifiestobeinoneormore  ofthefuzzysetsspecifiedforIk.Thedegreeofmembership  ofeachvalueofattributeikinanyof itsfuzzysetsisdirectly  based on the evaluation of themembership function of the  particularfuzzyset withthevalueofIkasinput.

So, given a database of transactions T, its set of  attributes I, and the fuzzy sets associated with quantitative  attributes inI.Note thateachtransactionTjcontainsvalues  ofsomeattributes fromIandeachquantitativeattributeinI  has two ormore corresponding fuzzy sets.The target is to  findoutsomeinterestingandpotentiallyusefulregularities,  i.e., fuzzy association rules with enough support and high  confidence.Weusethe followingformfor fuzzyassociation  rules.

For a rule to be interesting, it should have enough  supportandhighconfidencevalue,largerthanuserspecified  thresholds.To generate fuzzy association rules, all sets of  items that have a support above a user specified threshold  shouldbedeterminedfirst.Itemsetswithatleastaminimum  support are called frequent or large itemsets. The process  alternates between the generation ofcandidate and frequent   978-0-7695-4180-8/10 $26.00  2010 IEEE  DOI 10.1109/PCSPA.2010.310     itemsets until large itemsets are identified. The following  formula is used to calculate the fuzzy support value of  itemsetX and its corresponding setof fuzzy sets, denoted  )(XFSup .

Inthefuzzypatternprefixtree,ifa.ik.prefixcontainsthe  pattern is frequent, a.ik.ik+1prefix contains the pattern is  possibly frequent.If ik.prefix contains the pattern is  infrequent, then a.ik.ik+1prefix contains the pattern is  certainly infrequent.

Above two natures have provided a very good mining  strategy: If this nodes fuzzy support is smaller than the  fuzzy support threshold value Fminsup, i.e.this item is  infrequent,then the whole subtree does not need take to  consider,whichrootisthisnodeandlevelissame.Therefore,  Thealgorithmusingitcanreducethestorespaceremarkably,  avoidthecombinationexplosioneffectively,andenhancthe  miningeffectenormously.

Figure1. Entiretyprefixtreeoffrequent  B. The ProposedAlgorithm  The proposed algorithm is composed of three steps. In  the first step, we apply the  membership functions to  transform the original database into a fuzzy sets.After the  transformation, a transaction in thenewdatabasestores the  support of every quantitative item in the corresponding  transaction in the original database. In the second step,we  use a prefix tree approach to iterativelygenerate candidate  itemsetsandthenfindfrequentitemsets.Inthefinalstep,we  generate fuzzy association rules from the frequent itemsets  obtained in the secondphase. In the following,wepresent  andexplainindetailthethreesubroutinesineachphase.

So, fuzzy sets must be  consistent with the values of the corresponding attribute.

If not, the producing rules  have actual meaningless. Simultaneously if we do it ,the  algorithm also reduces the storage space and the  computation burden. The function CreateFuzzyPrefixTree  (FPT) iscreating thenodeRoot and insertingthe frequent  1item of the table L1 into FPT. The subroutine  GetCandidateItemFrq calculates the membership of the  certain candidate item. The subroutine  GrowFuzzyPrefixTree inserts the ncandidate item into  FPT?
