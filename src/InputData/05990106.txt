I.  INTRODUCTION  With the wide spread of Internet in recent years, the e- learning as a new education model has emerged. Though e- learning has appeared only for a short time, it has developed greatly. As well known, e-learning provides a fast, convenient and low-cost studying method for student. Because of the specificity of e- learning, the student?s personal information would be recorded in web log during learning. Through taking advantage of this trait, we can find user interest and hobbies in order to offer better personalized services and optimize the link structure of e-learning site [1]. Of course, we still need the technical support of Web data mining [2].

Because of the importance of user interest measurement, some scholars have gotten several advancements in this aspect. For example, Qinbao Song [3] has constructed a UserID-Url correlation matrix Mm ? n. In the matrix, hi, j is the number of times that the No. i user visits the No. j page (Url); and the row vector reflecting the user?s types, it also sketches out the user's personalized access, while the column vector represents the structure of the site also contains a common user access patterns. Hongdan Chu, Suyun JIAO, and Wei Ma [4] have defined a four-tuple (url, urli.time, urli.times, urli.size). It is on behalf of the user interest of page i.

Urli.times is the number of visits times. According to access frequency and access time, we can predict the user interest.

Shan Li, Fang Yuan [5] have made an improve algorithm to calculate the interest of user, the method have used the click times of user to reflect interest. Jia Chen [6] has constructed a type of interest matrix to measure the user interests. There are other scholars who have made many achievements in this field, because space is limited, there is no longer listed.



II. WEB SITE STRUCTURE AND THE INTEREST DEGREE  A. Web Site Structure A Web site can be viewed as a directed graph (as shown in Fig.1) [7]. It can be expressed as follows:  ( , , , )p pG N N E E= .

Where N is node set, also is the page set of web site. pN is the node attribute set, pN ={ iT | iT  is the times of customer USERID access Nodei },and Nodei N, i=1,2,?, n, n is the number of nodes. E is the edge set, also on behalf of all the  links between pages. pE is the edge set of attributes. pE = { jNP | jNP  is the path code of the edge}, j=1,2,?, m, m is the number of directed edges.

B.  Interest Degree The design of Web site generally follows a kind of  classification structure, that is, the organization of sub-page of one page is arranged according to the classification of sub- page. [8] On the other hand, this structure reflects the user's interest. This paper introduces the concept of interest degree to measure the user's interests.

Definition 1 (Interest degree) the interest degree is used to measure the level of user interest about a page.

Interest degree is expressed as INTER, it exists the following features:  A page has k links and a user visits all these links, if a user visits the No. i link first, then it is on behalf of his interest in a page of this link by up to others [9][10], that is,  ( ) ( ),INTER i INTER i i i? ?> ? ' There is an example about a user?s access to Website: ? u1 user access to the A, B, E ...

I  C  B  A  D  E F H  Fig.1 Web site structure figure     ? u2 user access to the A, C, F ...

? u3 user access to the A, D, H ...

Then about the u1 user, it is existed the following  relationship between his visit interest and his access path: ( ) ( ) ( )INTER A INTER B INTER E> > , it is noted there  are some kind of orderly relations which users visited Web sites. This orderly relationship reflects interest of users, which means a strong correlation exiting between visiting interest and access path of users. Therefore we need a way to dig out of this orderly relationship. So that we can find user's interests and accordingly adjust the structure of the site in order to access easily.



III. ALGORITHM DESIGN  A. Related Knowledge We use a simple interest association rules to achieve the  user?s interest forecast. Basic principle of the algorithm is the knowledge base of interest association rules which is composed of many interest association rules. Through the knowledge base of interest association rules, we can analyse the user's interests [7].

By the preliminary analysis about the page of users currently accessing, we will get interest set (dictionary), it is said with T:  1 2{ , ,..., }nT t t t= Which it  expresses the No. i interest items of T,  1, 2,...,i n= . Then we will define interest node, interest association rules, and the knowledge base of interest association rules.

Definition 2 (Interest node) an interest node is consisted of the interest term and its weight. It is expressed with binary  group ( , )tt weight , abbreviated as ( )node t , where t T? ,  tweight is the weight of the interest item t .

Definition 3 (Interest association rules) Interest  association rules is the contact among the interest nodes, it is said with a triple group  ,( ( ), , ( )),p p q qnode t weight node t abbreviated as ( ( ), ( )),p qrule node t node t the ,p qweight  expresses the  possibility of the interest ( ).p pnode t t  will change to ( ).q qnode t t .And ,0 1p qweight< ? ;  , , , {1,2,..., }p qt t T p q n? ? .

Definition 4 (The knowledge base of interest association  rules) the knowledge base of interest association rules is composed of interest association rules, it is expressed by RD:  { ( ( ), ( ))}.p qRD rule node t node t=  ( ( ), ( ))p qrule node t node t is interest association rules.

The knowledge base of interest association rules should be met:  , ( )  ( ( ), ( )). 1 p  p q p q node t  rule node t node t weight =? And  , , ( ( ), ( ))p q p qt t T rule node t node t RD? ? , {1,2,..., }p q n?  B. Construction and Update the knowledge Base of Interest Association Rules  Interest association rules of RD  are based on the large amount of historical data. It can be periodically reconstruct.

When users visit the page, they are usually in a row to visit multiple pages. These pages actually show current interest of users. This information is more important than those historical data which are used to predict user?s behaviour. So we have introduced a function ( )G n . It is a monotone non-decreasing function. This function can guarantee that the currently visiting page has greater proportion in forecast.

In addition, taking into account the speed of user access to web page, we have adopted a gradual approach to adjust the knowledge base of interest association rules. Specific algorithm is as follows:  Step1: P is the visiting page set of user during a period of  time, 1 2{ , ,..., }kP p p p= , (Assuming k pages were visited); Step2: let ip  is the user access to the page i, statistics  the frequency of the interest items it  in the dictionary T, which appear in ip , we will get set ( )iK p .

( ) {( , ) | , 0}i j j j jK p t f t T f? ?= ? > ; And jf  is the frequency which jt? appear in the page  ip  , 1, 2,...,i n= .

Step2: about the node(t) of the knowledge base of  interest association rules, we will make the following adjustments:  If  ( ). jnode t t t ?=   and ( , ) ( )j j it f K p? ? Then  ( ). ( ). ( )t t jnode t weight node t weight f G n= + ?  C. Using the Knowledge Base of Interest Association Rules to Predict User Interests  Interest association rules of the knowledge base of interest association rules indicate the possibility from a term (interest) to switch to other term (interest). Using it and combining with the current track that the user has accessed and the current page, we will find the user's interest degree (as shown in Fig.2).

According to the knowledge base of interest association rules, we can analyse the user's interests and hobbies. The specific algorithm is as follows:  Step1: using the incremental algorithm of the knowledge base of interest association rules process current pages;  Step2: According to the knowledge base of interest association rules, we can construct weight matrix. It is expressed withWHIGHT :  11 1   n  n nn  weight weight WEIGHT  weight weight  ? ? ? ?= ? ? ? ? ? ?  ?   Step3: for  1i =  to n {for 1j =  to n  sort  WHIGHT ?According to descending order?}  We will get INTEREST : 1 2{ , ,..., },mINTEREST INTER INTER INTER=  M is  the number of matrix elements;  Step4: if iINTER S> (S is specified threshold, {1,2,..., }i m= ).

Then the corresponding target page is the user?s favourite page, analysis the page, we will find the user's interests.

D. Test of the Algorithm We have tested above algorithms by library server?s log  files of http://www.lzcc.com site. The Web site consists of five layers, the first layer is Home, the second layer has 8 directories, the third layer has 40 directories, the fourth layer has 53 directories, and the fifth layer has 12 directories.

Because the Web log files have very large amount of data, so we only selected a representative day?s data of Web log to test this algorithm. First, the data of Web log are pre- processed in order to suitably analyse (as shown in table I).

TABLE I THE TABLE OF THE DATA  number Digital Resources 1 Super Star  Digital  Library 2 Scholar House Digital  Library 3 CNKI 4 Full-text database of Chinese Master thesis 5 Full-text database of Chinese PhD thesis  Then we have used Microsoft Visual c + + 6.0 to realize those algorithm, and have analysed above data. We have obtained the user?s greatest interest is CNKI, and the user?s minimum interest is scholar house digital library in all electronic resources. And we find most users browsing the article of CNKI about economics and management. Clearly the mining results are consistent with the actual, because more than 80% teachers and students of our school are researching  or studying economics and management.  We can see that the method is valid.



IV. SUMMARIES  With the development of the Internet, personalization of Web services has become an inevitable trend. Therefore, how to timely and accurately find the user's personal interests are the basis and foundation of personalization services. The measurement method in this paper about user interests is simple, effective and easy to implement. In the future our studies will combined with additional factors in order to design more accurate and convenient algorithm to measure the user interests.
