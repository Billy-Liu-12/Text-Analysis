COSMIC-2 / FORMOSAT-7: The Enduring Program  Kendra Cook

Abstract- The COSMIC-2/FORMOSAT-7 Program has persevered through unusual budgetary ups and downs since  the United States and Taiwan jointly agreed to pursue the mission in 2010. Despite these governmental challenges, the  Program continues to make progress.

COSMIC-2/FORMOSAT-7 is a satellite program designed to  deliver next-generation Global Navigation Satellite System  (GNSS) Radio Occultation (RO) data to users around the world. This program is the follow-on to the FORMOSAT-  3/COSMIC mission, which was a joint US-Taiwan 6-satellite constellation demonstration mission launched in April 2006.

COSMIC was the world's first operational GPS Radio  Occultation (GPS-RO) mission for global weather forecast; climate monitoring; and atmospheric, ionospheric, and  geodetic research. The GPS-RO data from COSMIC has been  extremely valuable to the climate, meteorology, and space  weather communities, including real-time forecasting users as  well as U.S. and international research communities.

FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC reached the end of its design life in  2011. The satellites have exhibited some unrecoverable  anomalies and consequently the critical real-time satellite  observing capability is degrading and will go completely offline  in the coming few years.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  (NOAA) and Taiwan's National Space Organization (NSPO) recognized the potential GPS-RO data gap due to the  degrading COSMIC/FORMOSA T -3 constellation and agreed  to implement the follow-on COSMIC-2/FORMOSAT-7  mission in 2010. Despite both sides of the pond experiencing  programmatic difficulties in the past several years throughout  the course of implementing the COSMIC-2/FORMOSAT-7  Program, significant progress has occurred especially  throughout 2012-2013.

It discusses the current satellite and constellation configuration, activities to determine the optimal and minimal  ground system architecture to meet data latency requirements,  and other discussions on the payload technology that will be  used to meet the program objectives. It also covers the current program status including some of the challenges the program  has overcome and successes experienced in 2013.
