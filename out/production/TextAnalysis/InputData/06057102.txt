I. INTRODUCTION With the development of information technology, the  amount of information which needs storage and communication is growing day by day and the types and forms of information are also becoming increasingly rich.

Fashion design teaching has also undergone tremendous changes. The development of multimedia technology, the use of various types of clothing design software and the deployment of network teaching platform bring fashion design teaching into a digital age. A great number of fashion design courseware have been stored in different kinds of network courseware databases. Network courseware are the fundamental part of network teaching. The so-called network courseware refers to a piece or a set of digital teaching materials, which integrate teaching design, establish specific courses and implement teaching activities, using the internet as the main communication platform[1].

However, due to the lack of information interaction and sharing, the isolated current database system can not predict future development trends based on existing data. The lack of data mining means results in the phenomenon of ?data explosion but knowledge poor?. Therefore, if association analysis of the current different systems is done, a lot of useful information will be found, such as::  ? Analysis of the browsing history of the whole network courseware database and analysis of the association mode of different courseware will help to  optimize the layout of the courseware database and improve its efficiency.

? Data mining about attributes such as age and gender of students with excellent academic records will provide guidance for future enrollment and improve the quality of students.

? Data mining about attendance rate and students? performance and analysis of the association mode of different courses will help to guide future curriculum..

In a word, data mining and analysis of the association mode of the above information will certainly help a lot in improving teaching efficiency and quality.



II. ABOUT DATA MINING  A. Concept of Data Mining Data mining is a step in database knowledge discovery  which is to extract implicit potential and useful information and knowledge in a large amount of incomplete, noisy, fuzzy and random data which people do not know in advance. Data mining which is frequently related to computer science always achieve the goals above through the statistics, online analytical processing, information retrieval, machine learning, expert system( relying on past experience rules) and pattern recognition[2].

B. Task of Data Mining Data mining?s task is to discover knowledge from data.

In practice, we divide data mining into the following three categories according to the use of different modes [3]:  1 Association Mode. Association mode, also known association rules, reflects the dependence or the associated knowledge between the event and other events. If there is some regularity between the two or more variables, we call it association. Association can be divided into simple     association, temporal association and causal association.

Association rules can be written as BA A is called the prerequisite B is called the follow-up. Data association is a kind of important knowledge which can be found existed in the database. The purpose of association analysis is to identify the relationship networking hidden in the database.

Association rules mining are to discover interesting associations or related links between the large amounts of sets of data items.

The story of ?diapers and beer? is a classic case about association rules. Agrawal first proposed the problem that to mine the association rules among the itemsets in the customer transaction database, after which a numbers of researchers do lots of research on the problem of mining association rules.

Their work included optimizing the original algorithm, such as introducing random sampling and thinking of parallel, to improve the efficiency of mining algorithm and promote the application of association rules  Association rule mining can be divided into two steps: first find all frequent sets whose frequency of emergence is at least the same as a predefined minimum support; the second step is to set strong association rules which must satisfy minimum support and confidence by frequent sets. The overall performance of association rule mining determined by the first step while the second step is relatively easy to implement.

Association rule mining is an important issue in data mining in recent years and has been extensively studied by the industry. This paper will apply data mining to Clothing Teaching, main to find the association rules hidden in the data items.

2 Classification Mode. Classification is to analyze a set of classified data objects. Each category of laws is called a class. First, select the classified training sets from the data and build the classification model using data mining techniques to do classification on data that hasn?t been classified. The main work is to further excavate the intrinsic nature by the different appearances. There are many classification algorithms, such as decision tree, rough set algorithm, Bayesian algorithm, artificial neural networks and genetic algorithm, etc.

3 Clustering Mode. Clustering is a process that to classify the data objects and to group the similar ones together.

Data clustering is to divide the data objects into several groups. Objects of each group have high similarity while objects in different groups have low similarity. The purpose is to make the distance between objects of the same type as short as possible and distance between individuals of different types as long as possible[4].

C. Process of Data Mining Data mining is as iterative process of human-computer  interaction as shown in Figure 1 which can be divided into three parts:     Figure 1. Process of Data Mining  1 Data Prepare. According to statistics, during the data mining implementation period, 60% of the time are spent on data preparation which shows the strict requirements of the data. This phase includes data selection, data preprocessing, and data transformation three steps.

2) Data Mining. Do data mining on the obtained and transformed data. Different mining algorithms have different efficiency in the implementation; therefore we should choose the appropriate mining algorithm based on the characteristics of the mining task.

3) Evaluate. Do analyze to extract information according to the decision from the final user to distinguish the most valuable information and submit it to decision makers through the decision support tools. It can be seen that the data mining process may take several cycles repeatedly. Once a step does not match the expected target, it should return to the previous step, readjust, re-run.



III. EXTENDED CONCEPT LATTIC  With the rapid development of computer and database technology, data storage shows the following characteristics  ? Sharp increase in the amount of data. Turing Award winner Jim Gray has proposed an empirical law: the amount of data generated every 18 months of the network environment equals to the amount of the data history [5].

? Increase of the complexity of data. The emergence of image data, video data and audio data increase the difficulty of mining.

? Multi-data source database. With the upgrading of     communications infrastructure and data transmission technology, there occurs more and more multi-data source database. These databases are often distributed in different areas, different geographical location and have different storage structures.

Multi-data source database increases the difficult of data mining and the time for data preparation. We can solve this problem from the following aspect:  ? Distributed association rule mining. HD (Hybrid Distribution) algorithm is the most mature algorithm in the area of distributed association rule mining [6]. It combines the advantages of CD and IDD algorithm to do divide the processor which executes CD algorithm into equal-sized groups with each group as a super-processor within which IDD algorithm is implemented.

? Classification model of multi-data source. General multi-source database includes homogeneous and heterogeneous two types. Meta-efarning provides a method that to mining classification model from data sources of the same kind, which shows the two important characteristics of multi-data source mining algorithms: high parallel performance and low communications load. In this method, supervised learning techniques are applied to classification model mining on contingent data sets, followed by generating a data set through the concept of local learning and generate the final classification model based on this data set.

? Distributed clustering. Most of the distributed clustering algorithms commit to be implemented concurrently. There are two ways: the first is to provide approximate distance measure standard; the second is to provide precise distance measurement by data broadcast.

In general, the distributed approach is to use accuracy to exchange speed, because it runs on the local data rather than the overall data which naturally results in a decrease in accuracy.



V.  EXPERIMENT DESIGN As shown in Figure 2, the data mining framework is  generally divided into four parts: data pre-processing components, data mining engine, model evaluation component and knowledge base components [7].

In the data mining model of fashion design teaching, data comes from multiple databases:  DB1: Educational management system. This system can be further divided into four parts: Students? Information Management, including students? names, ages and their departments, etc; Teachers? Information Management, including teachers? names, their departments, and course  directions, etc; Course Management, including course names, textbooks, course hours, course teachers and students who have selected the course, etc; Performance Management, preserving each student?s performance for each course.

DB2: Courseware database. A great number of fashion design courseware are stored in this system. Some of the courseware are downloaded from the internet and others are uploaded by teachers. Students can freely browse and use the courseware they need through a networked computer terminal, and they can also interact with teachers through this system.

By the way, the courseware database in the author?s college is self-developed.

DB3: Attendance management system. This system is mainly designed to record students? attendance for each course.

Data pre-processing, mainly aim at data in these three databases to complete the tasks as following:  ? Data cleaning: fill the vacancy values, smooth noisy data, identify and delete isolated points, resolve inconsistencies;  ? Data integration: implode multiple databases, data cubes and files.

? Data transformation: standardize (to eliminate attributes) and aggregate to project data from a large subspace to a smaller one.

? Data reduction: get the compressed data collection with a small amount to get similar or the same results.

? Data discrete: part of data statue, to statue data through the concept of hierarchy and data discrete which is important to numeric type of data.

VI. CONCLUSIONS Association rule mining is the focus point research in data mining, and is mostly conducted in the case of multiple data sources. This paper analyzes the theories and methods related to multi-source data mining applied to the field of clothing teaching to dig the association rules within the students. Due to space limitations, this article only gives the relevant system framework instead of details of the mining process.
