Advanced Channel Decoding Algorithms and Their Implementation  for Future Communication Systems  Norbert Wehn  Microelectronic System Design Research Group  University of Kaiserslautern  wehn@eit.uni-kl.de  www.eit.uni-kl.de/wehn  Today?s information society demands access to huge amount of data anywhere and data any  time. Hence wireless communications is a key technology. In such systems bandwidth and  transmission power are critical resources. Thus advanced communications systems have to  rely on sophisticated error correction schemes (FEC). Turbo- and LDPC codes belong to the  most efficient error correction schemes known by now. However the iterative decoding  nature of these codes imply big implementation challenges w.r.t. throughput, latency and low  energy. Moreover future communication systems require flexibility. Thus we have to trade-  off flexibility versus implementation costs. In this talk we discuss the design space for Turbo-  and LDPC decoders and compare different implementation alternatives. Moreover we show  the need of a design methodology which have to consider code-design and architecture  development in a unified way. We discuss this challenge on the base of 3GPP Turbo-  decoders and DVB-S2 LDPC decoders.
