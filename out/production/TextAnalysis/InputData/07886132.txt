Study on Extracting Implicit Patterns of  Patent Data based on Timeline

Abstract? Patent documents are provide a significant source of knowledge about future technologies. Many attempts have been conducted to mine important knowledge from patents to analyze new technology trends. In this paper, we will to analyze implicit knowledge derived from the patents dataset of Big Data domain from KIPRIS. Keywords that occur in the title of patents are classified into three categories: Approach, Goal Object, and Goal Predicate, in order to create a model of relations of title patterns. The same keywords found on the timeline interval will be analyzed and illustrated in the patent pattern which are able to depict the relationship of goals and approaches of the patents occurred in different time interval. As a result, implicit trends and knowledge related to of specific keywords of technology reflect of each time gap can be obtained.

Search result using ?Goal object, Goal predicate and Approach? pattern query is also found efficient and meet the user enquiry related technologies in timeline.

I. INTRODUCTION Patent databases are important knowledge sources  for industrial research and product development [1-3].

Even government agencies attempt to mine existing knowledge from patents and use the desired output to plan strategies and solve existing problems [4].

A patent is a document issued by an authorized governmental agency. The patent must be registered with the patent office in the location where protection is sought: national, regional (EPO: The European Patent Organization), or international (PCT: The Patent Cooperation Treaty). In several countries, the policies for strengthening the protection of intellectual property  are implemented for the protection of inventions and to register trademarks. People who need to obtain useful information from patent data can search freely accessible database, and guidelines exist to enhance the technique using keywords and classification [5-6].

As mentioned above, the increasing amount of patent data is influencing the increase in research of patent data analysis. Most studies are conducted to predict forecasting trends or advancement of technology in specific areas. A variety of methods and techniques for extracting knowledge from patents have been researched and developed. Patent data is stored in a patent information system and can be publicly accessed and analyzed. However, since not all patents provide useful information, it is necessary to create a tool that can ?prune? the set of patents to identify the smaller set of patents that will produce relevant knowledge. To the issues, several diverse studies have been conducted on the analysis of patents [7-8].

In this paper, we propose a study on extracting implicit patterns of patent data that are based on a timeline that considers implicit trends of specific keyword over time.  To extract patterns of patent titles over a timeline, we perform experiments using a real patent data set that containing patents data that reside in the ?Big data? domain.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

Related work and research areas are addressed in section II. The definitions are in section III. Patent data preparation and patent data sources are discussed in section IV. The experimental results are in section V.

The last section summarizes the conclusion and identifies areas for future work.



II. RELATED WORK The increasing amount of available patent data is  influencing the increase in research of the analysis and retrieval of patent data. The extraction of relevant information from patent data allows the identification and analysis of prominent research areas and facilitates the capability to map current topics of interest [9-11].

Recently new and important techniques have been created to analyze patents. These techniques include methods such as word cutting from patent titles and other abstract techniques [12]. In addition, some groups of researchers are focusing on techniques of detecting text semantics (meaning). Other studies focus on technology filtering by classifying approaches and goals, nouns and compound nouns [13].  In the case of the Japanese language, a technique of cutting out the words from sentences is required because there is no space within the statements. Also, in the case of the Thai language, the sequencing of words depends on their meaning (semantics) [14]. In the case of the Korean language analysis and other related research, word segmentation is the first step in further language analysis. The research results are then applied to separate a sentence into individual words, correcting word spacing errors in the spell checking process [15]. In addition, there are several challenges to traditional methods. Some groups are researching morphological analysis such as complex segmentation, frequent agglutination, and the formatting of words.

The proposed solutions are parsers to add to the Korean tree bank [16].

Because patent data is stored in multiple, diverse formats, much research has analyzed the patent document details. The extraction of data from patent documents is primarily conducted using data mining techniques, Text Mining and Natural Language Processing (NLP). These techniques have been used extensively as the initial step in the analysis of information stored in patent databases. Using these techniques can improve the process of explicitly acquiring knowledge.

In addition, there is related research regarding classification and searching to locate proper patents to find trends of patents in special fields. Researchers extract knowledge from patent data to acquire explicit and implicit knowledge. This knowledge is used for drawing a future patent road map or clustering patents based on technology or strategies. Planning is mainly conducted in the analysis area, or even during data collection to be used for innovation. One interesting aspect of the research involved the relationship of Patent Data based on Patent Networks [17]. Study of the results of this analysis of relationships between patents can assist organizations to understand implicit relations, trends of innovation, or search for patents required by the company. Accordingly, a variety of studies have been conducted to perform accurate analysis of patents and to use such patents according to their purpose.

In this paper, we identify pattern metadata and study the extraction of implicit patent patterns based on a timeline.  We retrieve the patent data by using specific keywords. From the collected patent titles we extract  three keywords to include: Approach (A), Goal Object (Go) and Goal Predicate (Gp) keywords [7]. We defined patent relationship types for use in extracting keywords such as V, V-invert, X, Y, Y-invert and Diamond types. Each relation is characterized by a shared keyword that exists in the two related patents.

In the X-model, the same Goal object (Go) exists in both patents. In the V-model, the two patents share a Goal predicate (Gp). In the V-invert model, the two patents share the Approach (A).

We also implement and describe a method to find relationships between two patents in each time interval.

The keywords shared between related patents include Approach (A), Goal Object (Go), and Goal Predicate (Gp) keywords. We can discover a relationship between two patents by finding the existence of shared (duplicate) keywords. The methods described in this paper can contribute to finding implicit trends of specific keywords about related technologies.



III. DEFINITIONS  A. Concept of Goal and Approach In this study, we analyze titles and abstracts of patent  documents by semantic concepts from previous research [8]. Each patent document is associated with a concept, labeled as ?Goal? and ?Approach?. A Goal refers to those keywords considered as key technology or methodologies managed within the patent tiles. An Approach refers to those methodologies or technologies used to achieve the previously defined Goal. The attention of this study, we selected a specifically data sets of patent. Thus groups of Goal and Approach keywords used weren't too variety. Thus it is the desired goal as focus on extracting patterns of patent.

B. Patent Patterns In a previous research [7], we proposed a patent  analysis for an organization based on the evolution model. That model identified type relationships between expressions in two or more patent titles. The relationships in previous research defined one or more keywords that overlap with the three keywords and the model was divided into eight sup-models [7]. In this experiment, after applying a timeline to extract a patent pattern, we realized that the I-model, and the double X-model occur very infrequently. These two models were therefore omitted, leaving six remaining models to be considered in this study. A symbol is used for each patent relationship model. A circle represents the Approach (A), a triangle represents a Goal Object (Go), and a diamond represents a Goal Predicate (Gp).

Table I. shows sample keywords from the experiment which are used to describe these relationships.

The X-Model is a case containing several Approaches, and several Goal Predicates mapped to one Goal Object. In Table I Example 1, the keyword ?Integration? in the X-model, is an example to illustrate Goal object (Go) sharing. Example keywords will facilitate the understanding of each relationship model definition.

The Y-Model is characterized by several Approaches mapped to a Goal Object and Goal Predicate pair. Accordingly, in Example 2, the keywords that are shared in the Y-Model are ?Integration? for the Goal Object and ?Service? for the Goal Predicate.

TABLE I.  EXPERIMENT SAMPLE KEYWORDS FOR EACH MODEL  Model Examples   X- Model        Ex.1             Y- Model        Ex.2             Y-invert- Model        Ex.3              V- Model        Ex.4             V-invert- Model        Ex.5             Diamond- Model       Ex.6                The invert Y-Model is a case such as several Goal Predicates are mapped to one (Approach, Goal Object) pair. In Example 3, keywords shared in this Y-invert- Model example are ?Network?, form the Approach and ?Management? form the Goal object.

The V-Model includes as Goal Predicate keyword sharing. The example in Example 4 is sharing the ?Measurement? keyword.

In the case of the Invert V-model, several Goal Objects and Predicates are mapped to a single Approach.  In Example 5, the Approach keyword shared in the V-invert-Model is the ?Video? keyword.

The last model is the Diamond-Model which is a case involving several Goal Objects mapped to an (Approach, Goal Predicate) pair. Example 6 shows this model sharing the ?Video? keyword specified for the Approach and the ?Service? keyword for the Goal Predicate.

The six patent pattern models defined are sufficient for this study. In each model, the patent pattern is created from two patent titles which share some common keywords. We will consider gaining knowledge from extracting implicit patterns of patents over a timeline in the next section.

Figure 1.  Explanation of the process of pattern extraction in the Timeline    C. Extraction pattern with Timeline The purpose of the analysis titles and abstracts is the  separation of patent titles into the three categories described previously. These categories are the Approach, Goal Object and Goal Predicate keywords.

The extracted patents within the timeline in Fig. 1 consist of Patent (T1) and Patent (T2) such that the time at which Patent (T1) is registered occurs prior to the registration of patent (T2). After classification, the A, Go, and Gp keywords are processed by a prebuilt morpheme analyzer. Once morpheme analysis is completed, the relationship network is shown as the relationship model in Fig. 2.

There are three examples in Fig. 2 Focusing on ?Approach Sharing -A-?, it is evident that this presents patent PT (t) and PT (t+1) that share the same Approach keyword, which (t), (t+1), (t+2) are subset of Time (T).

Thus this relationship will use the V-invert model.

Subsequently, PT (t+1) and PT (t+2) share the Goal   Extraction Implicit pattern with Timeline  Timeline  Patent (T1) A, Go, Gp  Patent (T2) A, Go, Gp  Mapping  T1 T2 T1 < T2    Approach:   Network  Goal Object: Management  Goal Predicate:  Service [Patent (T1)] Measurement [Patent (T2)]  Approach:   Internet [Patent (T1)] Mobile [Patent (T2)] Goal Object: Integration   Goal Predicate:  Management [Patent (T1)] Service [Patent (T2)]  Approach:   Internet [Patent (T1)] Mobile [Patent (T2)] Goal Object: Integration   Goal Predicate:  Service    Approach: Cloud [Patent (T1)] Network [Patent (T2)] Goal Object:  Location [Patent (T1)] Intelligent Lighting [Patent (T2)] Goal Predicate: Measurement    Approach: Video  Goal Object: Vehicle Crash [Patent (T1)] Virtual Interview [Patent (T2)] Goal Predicate: Processing [Patent (T1)]  Service [Patent (T2)]  Approach: Video  Goal Object: Vehicle Crash [Patent (T1)] Virtual Interview [Patent (T2)] Goal Predicate: Service  Time (T) ::= {(t), (t+1), (t+2),?(t+n)}     Object keyword. Similarly, the Goal Predicate keyword is shared by PT (t+2) and PT (t+n).

IV. PATENT DATA PREPARATION In this study, we used patent data from the Korea  Intellectual Property Rights Information Services (KIPRIS). This organization is designed to promote the use of patent information for research and development activities, patent disputes, corporate mergers and acquisitions and so on. For our preliminary identification, we used the keyword ?Big Data? domain to search for patent within KIPRIS; we only considered registered and approved patents. Specifically, this research initially studied narrow areas of technology. For these reasons, we selected the scope of the data set in the control environment and extracted related keywords using Word2Vec [18].

Word2Vec is an algorithm that extracts additional keywords that are directly related to the meaning of a provided set of specific keywords.

Our resulting experimental data set contained a total of 869 cases. From this data we extracted related keyword using Word2Vec. The four keyword for which we found relationships in this sample data were ?Big Data?, ?Mining?, ?Analysis?, and ?Distributed server?. For each of these keywords, we repeated our research of the KIPRIS patent data, and this exercise resulted in 172,400 patents for analysis. The example keywords in Table II, III and IV were through a process of extraction, removal and identify from patent data [8]. Table II illustrates Approach (A) keywords for each year. Table III and IV show Goal Object (Go), and Goal Predicate (Gp) keywords respectively.

There were many patents that share the Approach keyword each year. This may be construed as using the same methodology in several patents. The duplicate Approach (A) keywords were typical computer terms like ?Network?, ?Computer?, ?Video? and ?Cloud?.

On the other hand, almost all patents before year 2003 do not share Goal Object (Go) keywords. This suggests that the patent addressed a variety of areas. In terms of Goal Object (Go) information, the patents after year 2003 seem to have few duplicated keywords. The most common duplicated keyword is the ?Location? keyword. We assume from this result that the Goal Object (Go) of patents during this time are related by ?Location? or ?Area?. Table IV shows Goal Predicate (Gp) keywords in which the Goal predicate is an actions is taken by the Approach or Goal method, or the description of the Approach method. In the patents granted since 2000, many duplicated keywords  were found such as ?service?, ?management?, ?processing? and ?control?.

V. EXPERIMENT   In this study, we divide the process of extracting patterns into three stages. Fig. 3 presents a process for extracting and identifying patent relationships. The Step (A) is pre-processing and tagging using NLP which is step to remove the Stopwords and Semantics stopwords contained in the patent titles [17]. The Step (B) is extracting patterns within the timeline and Step (C) determines the patent relationship types.

Figure 3. A process for extracting and identifying patent relations.

A. Pre-processing and Tagging with NLP Pre-processing and tagging with NLP is performed  for patent titles from patent databases in order to extract their Goal Object (Go), Goal Approach (Gp) and Approach (A). An important step is a process involving analysis and tagging of the sentence structure. Based on the patent title set, several word dictionaries were built.

The words that frequently appeared in patent titles are removed. At this time, all of the keywords are assigned a weight by using TF-IDF [19]. We removed the keywords with low weight. The keywords with low weight frequently emerge from the collected patent titles. This suggests that those keywords are not of a great significance in the patent title. Bases on previous research [7], we use the weight value multiplied by the value the average of the TF-IDF value and keyword density of the entire document. We determined the threshold by manually inspecting the weight of the keywords.

To perform the morphological analysis, we used the KKMA ?kkokkoma morphological analyzer? [20] developed by the Intelligent Data Systems Laboratory at Seoul National University. This analyzer divides the parts of Korean speech using the Korean morpheme. Through the ?kkokkoma stemmers?, we extracted only nouns or verbs and substantives of the verb to represent the keyword. The keywords extracted with morphological analyzers are refined using a stopwords dictionary. This dictionary was created using TF-IDF algorithms. The acronym of the TF-IDF algorithm, i.e., ?TF-IDF? consists of two tokens: (1) the meaning of ?TF? refers to the frequency of a keyword in the patent title, and (2) the meaning of ?IDF? refers to a value computed using the reciprocal of the frequency of a keyword in the completed set of patent titles. We refined the keywords that appeared multiple times in different patent titles.

We used the value multiplied by the average of TF-IDF and keyword density of the entire document.

B. Extracting patterns with Timeline The result of the stage that performs the pre-  processing and tagging using NLP is a set of patents, each of which has an assigned Approach, Goal Object and Goal Predicate. The next stage is extraction of the pattern, with a timeline, such that the timeline is introduced to analyze the times of specific events that terminate with the registration of the patent with the appropriate Government authority. Fig. 4 shows conceptual model contribute to instance model which a timeline divided into T1 and T2 such that T1 is less than T2 and P1, P2, and P3 are extracted pattern in each different time interval. With this processing, an analyzed patent title will be selected to compare with other patents that are registered within the same time interval.

C. Experiment results As a result of the process of extracting patterns of  patent data based on a timeline, each patent title can be represented as a pattern in a timeline. The possible patterns include the X model, Y model, Y-invert model, V model, V-invert model, and the diamond model.

The result of this study includes 20 years of sample data and provided information about the possibility of the occurrence of each models, distributed over the 20 years, the distribution was: (1) the X model occurred 1.6% of the time, (2) the Y model occurred 17.7% of the time, (3) the V model occurred 17.7% of the time, (4) the Y- invert model occurred 19.4% of the time, (5) the V- invert model occurred 19.4% of the time and (6) the Diamond model occurred 24.2% of the time.

This result allows us to understand the pattern occurrence of patent data over a specified timeline.

From our experiment, we understand the patent data extraction, the model of patent relationships based on keywords, and how duplicate keywords are related to models and patents registered in each interval of the time period. From the implicit knowledge described by the appearance of duplicate keywords, we can create the candidate patterns that exist within the timeline. We describe the possibility models which exist as a result of duplicate keywords in Table VI.

TABLE VI.  IMPLICIT KNOWLEDGE FROM STUDY  Keywords Sharing Candidate Patterns  Approach       Goal Object       Goal Predicate        Approach &  Goal Object        Approach &  Goal Predicate     Goal Object &  Goal Predicate         In the case in which there are Approach keywords in any timeline, the possibility models include the Y- invert, the V-invert and the Diamond models. Because these models use similar Approach keywords that show an affinity of the Approach keywords and models, this suggests that two patents, registered at different times within the timeline, are occasionally related in terms of their core methodology. In the case where similar Goal Object keywords exist within the timeline, the appropriate models are the Y, the Y-invert and the X models. This suggests that two patents are related at different time with in the timeline. In other words, there are two patents with the same objective. This affinity occurs with the core methodology. If the Goal    Pattern of Patent related with Timeline  P1 P2 P3  time  T1 T2 T3 T4    Pattern    time  T1 T2 T3 T4  is the same  is the same  is the same     Predicate keywords are duplicated within the timeline, the best models are the Y, V and the Diamond models.

The significant factor in these relationships is that the Goal Predicate keywords are shared. This suggests that the two patents possess a methodology action which will occur with different Approaches or Goal objects.

Within the timeline, if the Approach and Goal Object keywords are similar, then the appropriate model is Y- invert. The Y invert model is used in the case when two patents have related methods and objectives. If two patents shared both the Approach and Goal Predicate keywords, then the correct model to use is the Diamond model. The Diamond model represents the case such that two patents are related in the sense that they have the same methodology and action. An example of this case occurs if two patents have the same method or action with different core technologies. If two models share the Goal Object and Goal Predicate keywords, then the Y model should be used. This model suggests that the two patents have a similar core technology and action, but different methodologies.



VI. CONCLUSIONS Researchers now understand that intellectual  property is an importance asset of many institutions. It is, therefore, more important than ever to obtain increased access to patents and patent materials; analysis of this patent data is now practical, effective, and necessary. The purpose of this study was to extract special implicit patterns of patent data based on several timelines. To perform the experiment, we chose the ?Big Data? topic and searched data using the KIPRIS.

Next, we extracted related keywords using Word2Vec.

The four keywords used in our experiment were ?Big Data?, ?Mining?, ?Analysis? and ?Distributed server?.

We extracted the meaningful keywords from the patent titles and placed them in Approach, Goal Object, and Goal Predicate categories.

A study of duplicate Approach and Goal keyword in occurring within patents within each timeline suggests that these patents are related by at least one keyword which will be identified by our methods that use our candidate pattern. The conclusion is based on the fact that, in this stage, corresponding patents possess pattern that occur within each timeline of our experiment.

Based on the timeline and patterns of patent within the data set, we can extract implicit patterns of specific keywords. In other words, Search result of element or object of patents in timeline using extracting patterns makes to understand the overviews or illustration of searching result efficient more than ordinarily keyword searching. This paper is the first step to extract time series patterns from patent data. Therefore the results and our proposed model will be evaluated in the future work.
