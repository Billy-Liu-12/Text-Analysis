Rough Knowledge Mining Algorithm Based on Extension  Decision Rule Lattice  for Electronic Patient Record

Abstract?Electronic patient record mining deals with the implicit and useful medical information stored in the electronic patient record database.By this technology the useful knowledge is extracted and the scientific and auxiliary decision-making is proved for the diagnosis and treatment of disease. In this paper,a rough knowledge mining algorithm (named RKMA) based  on extension decision rule lattice is presented. Firstly the electronic patient records are converted into different recordings in order to  be further reduced and classified in the medical database.

Secondly both variable rough thresholding and  concept lattice are relatethed.A novel extension decision rule lattice is constructed.This extension lattice can rough reduce the mutative knowledge attributions and well mine all disease diagnosis rules without more redundancy by avoiding finding frequent itemsets.

The experimental results show this RKMA algorithm well can mine consistent decision rules,and it is better robustness than other algorithms on the capability of attribution reduction and rule mining for electronic patient records.

I. INTRODUCTION Electronic patient records, as the important part of digit  hospital, can not only transfer the traditional paper-based medical patient record into digital format, but also provide the function of the checking, analyzing, exchanging the information ,and etc[1][2].With the rapid increase of patient record number in the database, how to extract the valuable information and knowledge has become one of the most interesting issues in the electronic patient record research field.

Hereby the research direction of electronic patient record mining is being taken. It mainly deals with medical information that is composed of the useful implicit pattern and knowledge stored in the electronic patient record database[2]. And via some ways, useful knowledge can be extracted in order that scientific and auxiliary decision-making can be provided for the diagnosis and reatment of diseases.

Currently, there are three main techniques to extract rules in the electronic patient record database. The first one is to reduce the quantity of candidate frequent item sets and the scanning times of the database[3,4,5].But it is ineffectual when dealing with large scale databases due to heavy I/O overhead.

The second one is to design a good distributed and parallel  algorithm[6,7]. The applying parallel processing to the electronic not merely a technical challenge.Instead, along with hardware and software?s challenge, the massive data processing tasks known collectively as ?data mining? have their impetus logical, business-oriented challenges. The third one is to sample the huge database to form a small sample set and extract information from it to obtain the approximate answers[8,9].But it can not renovate the mining objects in the medical database and its mining efficiency and quality are not perfect. We have proved that the above three techniques are quite unfit for the electronic patient record mining by lots of the experiments.

Rough set, concept lattice analysis and extension set theory,are three effective tools which are successfully applied in many knowledge discovering and data mining fields [10~12].

According to the features of the medical data in the database, a a rough knowledge mining algorithm (named RKMA) based on the extension decision rule lattice for electronic patient record is presented. The algorithm is adopted to convert the electronic patient record into the recording of database,then Extension decision rule lattice is constructed.It can rough reduce the mutative knowledge attributions in the database and well mine disease diagnosis rules of electronic patient record by avoiding finding frequent itemsets. Finally RKMA is applied in the experiment of  data sets from UCI machine learning.The results indicate that it is better robustness on the knowledge reduction and mining capability.

The organization of this paper as follows. Section 2 introduces some preliminary knowledge including rough set theory, concept lattice analysis and extension set theory, etc; Section 3 presents the related definitions and theorems; Section 4 describes rough knowledge mining algorithm(named RKMA) based on extension  decision rule lattice.Section 5 discusses the related capability of RKMA by experiment and applies it in the electronic patient record mining. Section 6 draws some related conclusions and points out the directions of future work.



II. PRELIMINARY KNOWLEDGE In this section, we briefly introduce some preliminary  knowledge including rough set theory, formal concept analysis and extension set  theory,etc.

Rough Set Theory (RST) RST, as a kind of soft computing techniques, was  proposed by Z. Pawlak in 1982, and it has been successfully applied in rough classification and knowledge discovery[13].

The basic concept of RST is the notion of the approximation space, which is an ordered pair ( , )G U R= , where  U : a non-empty set of objects, called universe, and R : an equivalence elation on U, *R U U? If ,s t U? and sRt , then s and t are indistinguishable.

For T U?  be a subset U , let [ ]Rt ? denote the equivalence  class of R? , containing t ( t?U ) ). Its lower approximation ( )LAG T and upper approximation ( )UAG T  in G , are defined  respectively as: ( ) { | [ ] }LA RG T t U t T?= ? ? ( ) { | [ ] }UA RG T t U t T?= ? ? ? ?  A rough set in G is the family of all subsets of U having the same lower and upper approximations.

B. Concept Lattice Analysis (CLA) Concept lattice analysis, germinated by Birkhoff and  considerably enriched by Wille, is a mathematical technique for clustering abstract entities known as formal objects that share common formal attributes into formal concepts organized in a concept lattice[16].

For a set X O? of objects, we define : { |X e E oRe? = ? for all }o E?  (the set of attributes common  to the objects in X). Correspondingly, for a set Y of attributes, we define : { |Y e E oRe? = ?  for all }o E?  (the set of objects which have all attributes in Y)[17].

The set of all formal concepts forms a complete lattice, called concept lattice, denoted by ( , , )L O E R  or simply L. The meet and join of the lattice are characterized by:  ( , ) ( , )t t t tX Y X Y t T t T t T ? = ? ? ?  ? ?  ( , ) ( , )t t t tX Y X Y t T t T t T ? = ? ? ?  ? ?  where ? is an index set, and for each t T? , ( , )t tX Y  is a formal concept.

C. Extension Set Theory (EST) Extension set theory was proposed by Cai Wen, in 1983,  which is a new kind of knowledge system for solving contradictory problem in the realistic world  based on matter- element and extension set[10].

Extension knowledge?as an important part of extension set theory, is the knowledge being used to solve the incompatible problems. Its composing is as follows:  Extension knowledge = extended formula + transformation implication formula + association function  The transformation implication formula in extension knowledge is a classical variable knowledge, and it is more  valuable knowledge for solving a incompatible problem. So extension knowledge has the character of variable knowledge.

Data mining can acquire knowledge (condition_result), extension transforming the condition and conducting transforming the result can acquire variable knowledge (extension knowledge):  condition resultT T? It calls this variable knowledge as extension data  mining. It is very fit for the electronic patient record mining.

The experimental results are follow of Figure.1 and Table.2.As can been seen that during that uncertain condition attribute quickly rised, the time trend of consistent decision rule mined is shortened, the number of representative rules extracted is decreasing, and on different datasets rule mining precision rate with RKMA algorithm is higher than UKAL and LACS.From lots of experimental results had shown this algorithm is better on both sides of the running speed and the mining capability.

VI. DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK The research of electronic patient record mining is one of  the most interesting issues for data mining field. In this paper, according to the features of the medical data in the patient record database, a rough knowledge mining algorithm (named RKMA) based on the extension decision rule lattice for electronic patient record is put forward. It can well mine all disease diagnosis rules without redundancy of electronic patient record by avoiding finding frequency itemsets. The mining experimental  results have indicated that RKMA algorithm can well extracte the consistent decision rules.

But because the medical data in the electronic patient record database has the especial features of variety, scarcity, redundancy and timeliness, etc, the RKMA mining capability is finitary for extracting the useful medical rules and knowledge in  the electronic patient record database.We must design the more excellent algorithm to mine medical rules in order that the scientific and auxiliary decision-making is provided for the diagnosis and treatment of disease .
