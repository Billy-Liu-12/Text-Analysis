Keynote Talk by Dr. Jeff Stuecheli:   Open Innovation with POWER8    IBM introduces POWER8, the first generation of systems built with open innovation to put data  to work; systems designed for big data, optimized to deliver superior cloud economics and an  open innovation platform at the heart of the open collaborative community revolutionizing the  way IT is created and consumed.

The POWER8 systems provide for a compelling combination of general purpose computing  capability combined with the ability attach accelerators. This connection is made with CAPI  (Coherent Accelerator Processor Interface), which enable PCIe devices to communicate with  CPU cores as full peers using shared memory constructs.

Dr. Stuecheli is a Senior Technical Staff Member in the Systems  and Technology Group. He works in the area of server hardware  architecture. His most recent work includes advanced memory  architectures, cache coherence, and accelerator design. He has  contributed to the development of numerous IBM products in the POWER architecture  family, most recently the POWER8 design. He has been appointed an IBM Master  Inventor, authoring some 100 patents. He received a B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from  The University of Texas Austin in Electrical Engineering.
