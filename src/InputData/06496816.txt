Unknown dynamics lead to large Doppler shifts, making communication challenging.  During EDL, a special form of Multiple Frequency Shift Keying (MFSK) communication is used for Direct-To-Earth (DTE) communication.  The X-band signal is received by the Deep Space Network (DSN) at the Canberra Deep Space Communication complex, then down-converted, digitized, and recorded by open-loop Radio Science Receivers (RSR), and decoded in real-time by the EDL Data Analysis (EDA) System.  The EDA uses lock states with configurable Fast Fourier Transforms to acquire and track the signal.  RSR configuration and channel allocation is shown.  Testing prior to EDL is discussed including software simulations, test bed runs with MSL flight hardware, and the in-flight end-to-end test.  EDA configuration parameters and signal dynamics during pre-entry, entry, and parachute deployment are analyzed.  RSR and EDA performance during MSL EDL is evaluated, including performance using a single 70-meter DSN antenna and an array of two 34-meter DSN antennas as a back up to the 70-meter antenna.
