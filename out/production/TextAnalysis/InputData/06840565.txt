I. INTRODUCTION Acupuncture is an important part of Traditional Chinese  Medicine (TCM). The history of acupuncture can be traced back before thousands of years. Today, acupuncture has been known as an efficient treatment of TCM, and it doesn?t has so much controversies like the other treatments of TCM, therefore acupuncture has been accepted by peoples in worldwide. But, as an treatment of TCM, it shared the same philosophy of TCM.

Based on syndrome differentiation theory of TCM [1], before the performance of acupuncture treatment, the cause and location of disease must be determined at first, and the relevant meridians and viscera would been located according to the location of disease, then certain acupuncture points can be selected for the treatment on the basis of above information.

Because of these unique and sophisticated thoughts, acupuncture is difficult to be fully understood and mastered by amateurs or foreigners. The modernization of TCM relied on modern science methods to help people comprehend the essence of TCM, as an important part of TCM, the development and application of acupuncture treatment also need proper science methods to reveal the essence of acupuncture treatment [1,2].

Currently, knowledge discovery and visualization methods has been conducted to the research of TCM [3,4], it has gained more and more attention during the modernization of TCM. As for researches of experiential discipline, it is significant to inherit the knowledge from medical treatises and clinical cases of acupuncture treatment. So the research of this paper focused on knowledge discovery of selection rules for acupuncture based on medical treatises of TCM. The efficiency of knowledge discovery methods has been proved by many researches such as artificial intelligence and information retrieval [5,6]. The knowledge discovery method has the potential to help people extract knowledge from massive data, so it is suitable for knowledge discovery research of acupuncture. Formal concept analysis (FCA) is a new and powerful mathematics method for knowledge discovery. It has been applied in many fields, which includes software engineering [7], document retrieval [8], data mining and knowledge discovery. But, there are certain defects when using FCA in the knowledge discovery of massive data such as medical treatises of TCM, for instance, when the formal context of FCA is a massive one, the Hasse diagram which is a visualization method of FCA would be very sophisticated, so extracting knowledge from the Hasse diagram might be tricky.

In order to achieve a better performance of knowledge discovery in acupuncture research, a new knowledge visualization method called structural partial-ordered attribute diagram (SPOAD) has been proposed based on partial order theory [9,10]. This method has the same mathematic foundation of FCA theory, but it demonstrated the knowledge of massive database clearer than FCA theory. And the accuracy of structural partial-ordered attribute diagram can be verified by association rule mining (ARM) method. Therefore, this paper provides a new approach for knowledge discovery research of TCM by combining the SPOAD and association rule mining.



II. THE BASIC THEORY OF SPOAD AND ARM First, Partial order theory is the foundation of structural  partial-ordered attribute diagram theory. In order to gain a better understanding of SPOAD theory, there are some  This work is partially supported by National Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under Grant No. 81273740, 61273019, 61201111 and 61074130.

DOI 10.1109/IMCCC.2013.175     fundamental principles as following should be discussed at the beginning.

Definition 1 Partial-ordered if there are sets M and N, a relation R is any subset of M and N?s Cartesian product NM ? . When NM ? , R is a relation on M. If  Ma? , Nb? , then relation R is a binary Rba ?),( , denoted by aRb . 1?R  is an inverse relation of R, define  abRaRb 1??                                     (1) If R is a relation on M, when Mzyx ?,, , defines  1) xRx ; 2) if  xRy and yRx , then yx ? ;  3) if  xRy and yRz , then xRz A Partial-ordered denoted by the symbol ? , if there is a  partial-ordered in set M, denoted by ),( ?M .

Definition 2 Let ),( ?M  be a poset, if MA? ,  assumed for all the element a of set A, there is )( Mxax ?	 , and x is the lower bound of A, hypothetically for all the element a of set A, there is )( Myya ?	 , then y is the upper bound of A. If there is a maxim element of all the lower bound of A, then set A has an infimum. If there is a minimum element of all the upper bound of A, then set A has a supremum.

Definition 3 Let ),( ?M  be a poset, if there are both infimum and supermum for any subsets of M, then ),( ?M  is a complete lattice.

Definition 4 Let U be a set of objects, and M is a set of attributes, I is the relation between U and M, then the triple  ),,( IMUK ? is a formal context. IMU ?),( means object U has an attribute M. For a formal context, a cross ?or a number 1 represent there is a relation R between two elements.

Definition 5 A multivalued formal context is a quaternary ),,,( IWMUK ? , set U is the set of objects, set M is the set of attributes, set W is the set of attributes? values, relation I is the relation among U, M and W,  WMUI ??? means object u had an attribute m and the value of the attribute m is w.

A multivalued formal context must be transformed into a normal formal context, and then it can be processed by SPOAD theory. By using concept scale, a multivalued formal context are transformed into a normal one, this method is called conceptual scaling. There are two steps of conceptual scaling theory, at first, a concept scale ),,( mmmm IMUS ?  obtained by the meaning or classification of attributes, and Mm? ,  mUUm ?)( ; secondly, by using the concept scale MmmS ?)( , a multivalued formal context became a single-valued formal context. The concept scale is just a medium, not the eventual transformed formal context.

As the visualization method of FCA, Hasse diagram has a multiple layers structure with many cross lines, so it is difficult to reveal all the knowledge clearly. In order to achieve the visualization of partial-ordered theory, the structural partial- ordered attribute diagram has been proposed. SPOAD is a plane structure diagram without cross-lines, each node of SPOAD represents an attribute; each path of SPOAD represents an object. Therefore, the relation between objects and attributes can be distinctly reflected by SPOAD, concise hierarchical relation and concrete classification significance are helpful to knowledge discovery.

Association rule mining is a main direction of data mining research [11]. It was proposed by R.Agrawal for the research of knowledge discovery. The association relation between items of database can be demonstrated by this method.

Definition 6 if supmin_)( ?YXSupport , supmin_  stands for the minimum support, and  confYXConfidence min_)( ? , the minimum confidence denoted by confmin_ , association rule  YX ?  is a strong association rule, otherwise, it is a weak one. In this paper, association rule mining performed by Aprior algorithm [12].



III. STANDARDIZATION RESEARCH OF ACUPUNCTURE POINTS FOR CLINICAL APPLICATION AND FORMAL CONTEXT  CONSTRUCTION  It is essential to have a highly qualified prescription of acupuncture therapy during the knowledge discovery research of clinical acupuncture point?s selection. So it is a significant procedure to pre-process the clinical prescription of acupuncture therapy. The improvement of data quality can help knowledge discovery gain better precision and accuracy.

Standardization research of acupuncture points includes the following contents.

The classification of acupuncture points is the first step of acupuncture data standardization. Commonly, acupuncture points can be classified into three kinds, acupuncture points of meridians, acupuncture points beyond meridians, and acupuncture points of ashi. When the patient?s acupuncture points of ashi has been pressed, it would cause the pain of patient.

Secondly, the name of acupuncture points has been standardized. The database of this research is from the TCM medical treatises ?acupuncture points interpretation of 430 kinds of diseases?, which is written by Li-gong Xue [13].

During the research of this paper, the name of acupuncture points in this book has been unified.

In the meanwhile, acupuncture points in the research material have been divided by different meridians. There are 14 different meridians in human body, includeing 12 normal meridians, governor vessel and conception vessel.

After these standardization procedures, the preprocessing of data has been achieved. The formal context constructed based on these data.

There are 4 kinds of respiratory diseases in the database, bronchitis, bronchial asthma, bronchiectasis, and lobar pneumonia. Take the formal context of respiratory diseases as example, during the knowledge discovery of respiratory diseases, the formal context structured from three different angles. First, using the name of respiratory diseases as the objects set, the attributes set included all the acupuncture points which has been used in respiratory diseases treatment, these two steps constructed the main acupuncture point?s formal context based on respiratory diseases clinical therapy. Second, 14 meridians became the elements of object set, the attributes set still the set of all the acupuncture points which has been used in respiratory diseases treatment, then meridians formal context of respiratory diseases has been structured. Thirdly, the elements of object set are the main symptoms of respiratory diseases, and the attributes set contains all the support acupuncture points for the treatment of main symptoms, these procedures constructed the supportive acupuncture points formal context.



IV. DATA ANALYSIS AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY After constructing the formal context based on the  procedures above, there are three kinds of formal context are needed to be analyzed. By using the SPOAD theory, these formal contexts have been researched to accomplish the knowledge discovery. The following paragraphs used the formal context of respiratory diseases to demonstrate the data analysis and knowledge discovery process.

The main acupuncture point?s formal context has been analyzed and summarized in general. In the book ?acupuncture points interpretation of 430 kinds of diseases?, the respiratory diseases have been divided into 4 broad categories, and 13 types. There are 32 different main acupuncture points have been used in the acupuncture treatment of respiratory diseases.

Figure 1 shows the SPOAD of the main acupuncture point?s formal context of respiratory diseases.

Figure 1. The SPOAD of the main acupuncture points.

Based on the coverage relationship of attributes, there are 8 layers in the SPOAD of the main acupuncture point?s formal context of respiratory diseases. The first layer demonstrated that the acupuncture point Feishu which denoted by a1 was the most common used acupuncture point for the therapy of respiratory diseases. In the second layer, Dingchuan (a19), Lieque (a3), Zhongfu (a23) and Shenshu (a16) acupuncture  point has been used as main acupuncture point for respiratory diseases treatment. By comparing the frequency table of main acupuncture points as Table.1, Feishu acupuncture point was also the acupuncture point of the highest frequency, and has been used with Dingchuan, Tiantu (a20), Hegu (a5), Chize (a2), Tanzhong (a21) and another acupuncture points.

TABLE I. THE FREQUENCY TABLE OF MAIN ACUPUNCTURE POINTS  The name of acupuncture Points Frequency  The name of acupuncture Points  Frequency  Feishu, Dingchuan 5 Chize, Feishu 4  Tiantu, Tanzhong 4 Dingchuan, Tiantu, Tanzhong 4  Dingchuan, Tiantu 4 Feishu, Dingchuan, Tiantu 4  Feishu, Tiantu 4 Feishu, Dingchuan, Tiantu, Tanzhong 4  Hegu, Feishu 4  In order to discover the interdependence of main acupuncture points in SPOAD, the formal context has been changed into equal data, then formal context transformed into transaction database of association rule mining under following procedures. At the beginning, each name of diseases are denoted by a transaction, and assigned an unique TID; then all the selected acupuncture points used in the treatment have been treated as the element of item set; after the two steps above, the transaction database of respiratory diseases has been structured.

In the end, the Aprior algorithm has been applied to perform association rule mining. Table.1 is the association rule mining result of respiratory diseases transaction database. The threshold of the minimum support and the minimum confidence sets as 30 percent. After comparing the SPOAD and results of association rule mining, the conclusion was the acupuncture points which has been frequently used in the therapy of respiratory diseases often located in the higher layer of SPOAD, and there was a positive correlation between the usage frequency of acupuncture point and the layer number of this acupuncture point in SPOAD. And this conclusion can be explained by TCM theory.

Figure 2. The SPOAD of the meridians formal context of respiratory diseases.

The SPOAD of the meridians formal context conducted the knowledge discovery of meridians formal context of respiratory diseases. In the Figure 2, the main acupuncture points which has been selected for respiratory diseases     treatment classified under the 14 meridians. By observing the SPOAD of the meridians formal context the following knowledge can be discovered. In the acupuncture therapy of respiratory diseases, acupuncture points for the treatment are most frequently selected from three meridians that included conception vessel, governor vessel and meridian of Hand- Yangming. Acupuncture points is the certain points on the meridian, each acupuncture points has a specific classification of meridian. Under this principle, each path from the SPOAD of the meridians formal context can be identified as a meridian, and there aren?t any bifurcations in each path.

In the path of conception vessel (o10 is Figure 2), there are six acupuncture points has been selected in acupuncture treatment of respiratory diseases, including Zhongwan (a13), Tiantu (a20), Tanzhong (a21), Guanyuan (a30), Shenque (a31), and Qihai (a32). It is the meridian that has the most acupuncture points used in the treatment of respiratory diseases, and this phenomenon can be explain by TCM theory. So this knowledge has medical meaning in TCM clinical therapy.

And this knowledge discovery can also be used in research of selection rule of acupuncture points in the therapy of specific respiratory disease such as bronchial asthma.

Bronchial asthma is a common allergic disease of pulmonary and has a high rate of paroxysm. In TCM theory, bronchial asthma belongs to three diseases including wheezing, dyspnea and abnormal rise of Qi. Also in TCM theory, bronchial asthma are caused by Fu-yin inside human body, attacked by external wind chill or addicted to certain foods, and other reasons, basically, the paroxysm of bronchial asthma is caused by functional disorder of pulmonary, spleen and kidney. Figure 1 demonstrated that there are nine acupuncture points had been selected in the acupuncture therapy of bronchial asthma (o1, o2, o3 of Figure 1 are the three syndrome types of bronchial asthma). The nine acupuncture points included Feishu (a1), Dingchuan (a19), Tiantu (a20), Tanzhong (a21), Neiting (a11), Dazhui (a6), Zhongwan (a13), Shenshu (a16), and Kongzui (a22).

Figure 3. The SPOAD of the formal context of bronchial asthma.

In the formal context of bronchial asthma, object set included all the syndrome types of bronchial asthma, and acupuncture points used in the treatment of different syndrome  types are the elements of attribute set. Figure 3 is the SPOAD of bronchial asthma and was structured based on this formal context. Cold sputum asthma, asthma due to phlegm-heat, and spleen-kidney Qi deficiency are the three syndrome types of bronchial asthma, and there are eight main symptoms including abrupt onset, pruritus of nasopharyngeal, thirst & stuffiness of thoracic, vexation & stem of pharyngeal, white of complexion, evil wind & self sweat, evil cold & cold of limb, and dilute sputum. Base on Figure 3, different acupuncture points has been selected due to different syndrome types and symptoms.

Figure 3 indicated that the selected acupuncture points are used for dredging meridians in the acupuncture treatment of bronchial asthma. These different combinations of acupuncture points intended to regulate liver, spleen, and kidney, balance the functional metabolism of viscera, and then the bronchial asthma can be cured.



V. CONCLUSIONS The method proposed in this paper works well in  knowledge discovery of selection rules for acupuncture points.

The theory of structural partial-ordered attribute diagram can comprehensively, and objectively reveal the knowledge that hided in the massive database or medical treatises of TCM through a visualization result. The method provided a scientific and advanced technological for the heritage of Traditional Chinese Medicine.
