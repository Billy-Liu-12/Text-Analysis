Abstract?In June and July 2007 Mars experienced a dust storm that grew to envelop all but the polar latitudes of the planet.1, 2  This dust storm was the first global dust storm to occur while the twin Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) began surface operations.  It is estimated that the dust in the atmosphere prevented over 99.6% of direct sunlight from reaching the surface at the peak of the storm.  Data collected indicated that solar array energy output was reduced to approximately 15% of maximum.  The reduction in insolation and energy output posed the greatest risk of ending the mission for both rovers at that time.

To maintain the health of the rovers, the sequencing team modified the nominal planning strategy to reduce power consumption to levels matching solar array energy generation.  Existing planning and sequencing tools were used in new ways to increase confidence in the modeled state of the rover, including the power state. This paper will discuss the process used to predict the state of the rover during the storm.

As the storm began to subside, the dust began to fall out of the atmosphere.  Opportunity?s arrays were cleaned by the wind blowing dust off of its solar arrays.

Spirit was parked on a north-facing slope in January 2008 as preparation for the southern Martian winter.  There was concern that Spirit?s power levels during winter would be reduced to below those experienced during the dust storm.  Strategies developed during the dust storm served as a foundation for low power winter operations.  Operating both vehicles during the dust storm gave the team high confidence in their ability to guide Spirit through its third Martian winter.
