I. INTRODUCTION Data mining research and application is one of the  most active branches of the database field, and it is a research hotspot. Multimedia data is generally difficult to describe with symbols, such as image color distribution, movement of video and tone of audio, because they are belong to the non-formatted data, and they are content-based. Multimedia Data Mining MDM has become one of the most challenging areas of information decision area, and many effective association rule mining algorithms have been proposed and improved, but the association rules mining methods and models based on image content are so far different from the ordinary rules because of the complexity of mining target. this paper proposes a progressive association rules mining algorithms based on image content named PARM.

This paper first introduces the features of multimedia image data mining, which are the association of content features between image content and non-image, the association between image content that is not related to space and the association between image content that is related to space. Second, this paper puts forward the architecture of a multimedia image data mining system based on content, which mainly includes three parts: Multimedia Image Database named MIDB, which is a process to pick up the features from MIDB to form multimedia image characteristic database called MICDB; Multimedia Image Mining Engine named MIME, which mines MICDB using mining methods to  produce a series association rules; and Multimedia Image Mining Interface named MIMI whose main task is to interact and visualize the mining results and to display the mining results to the user in an appropriate manner. Next, this paper introduces the corresponding concept of multimedia image data association rule mining that is support, confidence and strong association rules. Then this paper proposes an algorithm of progressive association rules mining based on image content named PARM. At last an example is used to illustrate the application of the algorithm.



II. FEATURES OF MULTIMEDIA IMAGE DATA MINING Because of the characteristics of multimedia data, the  association rule mining is different from transaction data. The association rules mining based on image content have the following characteristics:  The association of content features between image content and non-image. The rule that 50 percent upper part of the photo is blue, it is likely to be sky belongs to such rules and it associates the content features of 50 percent of the upper part of the photo is blue with non-content features sky.

The association between image content, which is not related to space. The rule that if a picture contains two blue circles then it mostly contains a red square belongs to such rules. It associates the content features containing two blue circles with another content features containing a red square.

The association between image content, which is related to space. The rule that if a red rectangle is between two yellow squares, then it may be a large oval object below belongs to such rules.

Because the object that contains multiple repeated pictures of is an important feature in the image analysis, we cannot ignore the recurring problem of the same object.

A characteristic of the two images in a resolution level is the same, but in a finer resolution is different, so a method in which resolution is refined step by step. We can first mine the high frequency mode in a relatively coarse, and then go a further analysis, which is above the minimum support.



III. THE ARCHITECTURE OF MULTIMEDIA IMAGE MINING SYSTEM  The multimedia image data mining system is developed on the basis of multimedia image data retrieval system [2]. In this paper, we put forward the architecture of multimedia image data mining system, which is shown as Figure 1. It can be seen from the figure that the multimedia image data mining system consists of three parts: Multimedia Image Database named MIDB, Multimedia Image Mining Engine named MIME and Multimedia Image Mining Interface named MIMI. MIDB part is a process which pick up the features from MIDB to form multimedia image characteristic database called MICDB. Because multimedia image data is unstructured and is difficult to represent and manipulate directly, we need pick up characters from MIDB, and use features to represent images, and the features can be represented by structured data, thus the mining of multimedia image data is converted to the mining of MICDB, that is the mining of structured data, so we can mine the multimedia image data use the methods which is used in the mining of transaction data. Because of the difference between image data and transaction data, there is a necessary to improve the mining method of transaction data. MIME is an important part of multimedia image mining systems and it mine MICDB using mining methods to produce a series association rules. MIMI?s mainly task is to interact and visualize the mining results, and to display the mining results to the user in an appropriate manner.

IV. A PROGRESSIVE ASSOCIATION RULES MINING ALGORITHM BASED ON IMAGE CONTENT  A. The Association Rules of Multimedia Image Data Mining  The association rules of image refer to the frequent mode of image characters. Suppose D is an image set, P1, P2, ?Pn, Q1, Q2, ?Qm is describes predicate which present the size, color, texture, object, space position, key of the image, association rules P1?P2 ??Pn?Q1?Q2??Qm[S%?C%], S% present the  support of the rule and C% present the confidence of the rule. The rule may be understood that when P1, P2, ?Pn take part, Q1, Q2, ?, Qn also take part.

Definition 1: if the ratio of the property of P ? Q in D is S, then the support of the association rule P?Q in D is S?  n ?? QPSupportS ?= *100%              (1)  ?? QPSupport ?  is the property amount in D, n is the total amount of property.

Definition 2: if the ratio of the property of P ? Q in D is S, then the confidence of the association rule P?Q in D is C,  %100* ??  ??  PS QPSC ?=                       (2)  ?? QPS ?  is the support of P ? Q, and ??PS  is the support of P.

The task of association rules mining is to generate all association rules which meet the user-specified minimum support (minsup) and minimum trust (minconf), that is the support and confidence is not less than minsup and minconf. Rules which meet minsup and minconf at the same time are called strong association rules.

B. A Progressive Association Rule Mining Algorithm Base on Image Content  A progressive association rule mining algorithm base on image content which called PARM is a process included three steps: first, find all frequent character sets under original resolution ratio; second, derivate the association rules from frequent character sets; third, set new resolution ratio and repeat Step 1 and Step 2 until no finer resolution is preserved.

The algorithm is shown as the following: Input: MICDB, min_sup, ori_resolution Output: frequent character itmes L 1. Step 1: Set ori_resolution  //set original  resolution 2. Step 2: Pickup MICDB   //pick up MICDB  under the resolution 3. Step 3: L1 = find_frequent_1-  itemsets(MICDB);   // mine the frequent 1- charater items  4. Step 4: For (k=2;Lk-1 ?? ;k++) { Ck = apriori_gen(Lk-1 ,min_sup); // call method  of apriori_gen to generate frequent k-characters For each transaction t ? MICDB {    //  scan  MIDB and determine the suppose of each candidate set Ct = subset(Ck,t);         //  get the candidate set of  t for each candidate c ? Ct  c.count+count;              // count the amount of frequent k-character items  }    Lk ={c ? Ck|c.count?min_sup} }  5. Step 5: L= ? k Lk; 6. Step 6: Set new_resolution    //  set new resolution 7. Step 7: if (new_resolution is not null)  goto step?2?   // go to step 2 else               // return frequent character items  L Return L

V. EXPERIMENT EXAMPLES OF ALGORITHM APPLICATION  Under the resolution of 640*480, we pick up the characters of multimedia image database to form MICDB. The MICDB under resolution of 640*480 is shown as table 1. In table 1, I1 property behalf on large size of the image, I2 property behalf the key "sky", I3 property behalf bright texture, I4 property behalf the color ?blue?, I5 property behalf the format of image .gif.

TABLE 1. MULTIMEDIA IMAGE CHARACTER DATABASE MICDB (RESOLUTION 640*480)  TID Character Items 1 I1, I2, I5 2 I2, I3, I4 3 I3, I4 4 I2, I3, I4  Suppose the minimum support is 50 percent, then the frequent character sets is {I2, I3, I4}. From the frequent character sets, we can find the association rules are: I2 ?I3?I4, I2?I4?I3, I3?I4?I2, I2?I3?I4, I3?I2 ?I4, I4?I2?I3. The confidence of each rule is:  C(I2?I3?I4)=2/2=100% C(I2?I4?I3)=2/2=100% C(I3?I4?I2)=2/3=67% C(I2?I3?I4)=2/3=67% Suppose the minimum confidence is 70 percent, then  we can conclude the strong association rules are I2?I3 ?I4 and I2?I4?I3. According to these two strong association rules, we can get two pieces of information: one is bright texture sky is probably blue; another is that the texture of blue sky is probably bright.

Suppose the texture is 1024*768, then the MICDB which is picked up from MIDB is not the same with above, accordingly the frequent character sets and strong association rules is different from above.

Under the resolution of 1024*768, we pick up the characters of multimedia image database to form MICDB. The MICDB under resolution of 1024*768 is shown as table 2. In table 2, I1 property behalf on large size of the image, I2 property behalf the key "sky", I3 property behalf bright texture, I4 property behalf the color ?blue?, I5 property behalf the format of image .gif, I6 property behalf high degree.

TABLE 2. MULTIMEDIA IMAGE CHARACTER DATABASE MICDB (RESOLUTION 1024*768)  TID Character Items 1 I1, I2, I5, I6 2 I2, I3, I4, I6 3 I3, I4, I6 4 I2, I3, I4  Suppose the minimum support is 50 percent, then the frequent character sets is {I2, I3, I4, I6}. From the frequent character sets, we can find the association rules are: I2?I3?I4?I6, I2?I3?I6?I4, I2?I4?I6 ?I3, I3?I4?I6?I2, I4?I6?I2?I3, I3?I6?I2?I4, I3?I4?I2?I6, I2?I6?I3?I4, I2?I4?I3?I6, I2? I3?I4?I6, I6?I2?I3?I4, I4?I2?I3?I6, I3?I2? I4?I6, I2?I3?I4?I6. The confidence of each rule is:  C(I2?I3?I4?I6)=1/2=50% C(I2?I3?I6?I4)=1/1=100% C(I2?I4?I6?I3)=1/1=100% C(I3?I4?I6?I2)=1/2=50% C(I4?I6?I2?I3)=1/2=50% C(I3?I6?I2?I4)= 1/2=50% C(I3?I4?I2?I6)= 1/3=33% C(I2?I6?I3?I4)= 1/2=50% C(I2?I4?I3?I6)= 1/2=50% C(I2?I3?I4?I6)= 1/2=50% C(I6?I2?I3?I4)= 1/3=33% C(I4?I2?I3?I6)= 1/3=33% C(I3?I2?I4?I6)= 1/3=33% C(I2?I3?I4?I6)= 1/3=33% C(I2?I3?I4)=2/3=67% Suppose the minimum confidence is 70 percent, then  we can conclude the strong association rules are I2?I3 ?I6?I4 and I2?I4?I6?I3. According to these two strong association rules, we can get two pieces of information: one is high degree of bright texture sky is probably blue; another is that the texture of high degree of blue sky is probably bright.
