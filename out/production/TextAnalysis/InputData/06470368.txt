Mining the Associations between Pharmic Quality and Ingredients of Traditional Chinese Medicines*

Abstract - This paper presents our works to tackle three key problems in modern research of traditional Chinese medicines.

Based on a dataset of 100 medicines (each with 60 major ingredients), we evaluate various data mining approaches in order to unveil the underlying associations between these chemical ingredients and the pharmic qualities of the medicines.

Based on our experiements, we conclude that these associations do exist and can be effectively unveiled. Various performance enhancement techniques are then evaluated, among which we identify the best classification approach for practice. These unveiled associations between pharmic quality and ingredients of traditional Chinese medicine can help guide future researches in this area, particularly in the development of new medicines.

I. INTRODUCTION  Centuries of practice of traditional Chinese medicine[9] have seen numerous heuristics and prescriptions be found, accumulated, inherited and applied on a regular basis.

Compared to their western counterparts, most of them have been proven effective and with less side-effects. Its further development and spread-out abroad would be difficult to achieve if without a modem scientific explanation, in particular a systematic analysis and theory about its pharmic qualities of these medicines.

There have been some people trying to introduce scientific analysis to traditional Chinese medicine in the past few decades, particularly in the analysis of its pharmic quality theory. This theory is considered the foundation of traditional Chinese medical science, and it is very different from its western counterpart in that it focuses on sapor (Xing(\)Wei(\), or taste), virulence, impact (Sheng(-)Jiang(\)Chen(!)Fu(/), or literally ascending, descending, sinking and floating) and tropism (Gui(-)Jing(-)), which are considered core of this pharmic quality theory. However, traditional Chinese medical science provides people only intuitive heuristics about how to apply this theory without a scientific interpretation. This hinders its further development and public acceptance in modem practice.

There are three major questions that must be addressed when we consider the ingredients and the pharmic quality of traditional Chinese medicines. The first is whether there is  indeed any association in between, the second is how to unveil these associations, and the third is how to improve the accuracy of our prediction when given an unknown medicine.

To answer these above questions, we seek for help from data mining[3]. It is the automated or convenient extraction of patterns representing knowledge implicitly stored or captured in large databases, data warehouses, the Web, other massive information repositories, or data streams. Various data mining approaches have been developed to help people to unveil new and potentially useful and understandable knowledge from massive amount of data available. They have been successfully applied to various domains, for instance business intelligence. Prior work has seen it be applied to analysis of traditional Chinese medicines, as discussed in the latter section.

We collect data about 60 different major chemical ingredients of 100 most common traditional Chinese medicines collected from various sources, and use them as our experimental dataset for mining. Data cleansing is then applied in order to detect and correct (or remove) corrupt or inaccurate data within. During this process, some numerical data are standardized, some are normalized, some are categorized (for instance the existing of some chemical ingredients are indicated as 1 or 0 if otherwise), some missing data are filled in, and some irrelevant attributes are filtered.

We use this resulting dataset to analyze the association rules between their ingredients and pharmic qualities.

This paper applies various data mining approaches in order to answer the three questions listed above. Experimental results give positive answers to the first and the second questions, and various performance enhancement techniques have been evaluated in pursuit for the answer to the third question.

The outline of this paper is as follows. Section II uses association rule mining to answer the first question given above. Section III then discusses how such associations can be unveiled via decision tree mining (i.e. the second question), before section IV discussing performance enhancement techniques that can further improve the prediction accuracy when given the ingrdients of an unknown medicine, i.e. the third question given above.

II. ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN PHARMIC QUALITY AND INGREDIENTS  A. Association Rule Mining Association rules demonstrate attribute-value conditions  that occur frequently together within a given set of data. They suggest the probability of cooccurrence of certain itemsets.

Association rule mining aims to discover such associations between is widely used for analysis of market basket and transactio n data.

In our experiments, we choose the influential apriori algorithm for association rule mining in order to identify the itemsets whose frequency surpasses a given threshold for Boolean association rules. Apriori algorithm is based on the monotony of frequent itemsets which suggests that if an itemset is a frequent set, then any subset of it must be frequent itemset as well, otherwise, any superset of it must be non- frequent as well. The algorithm adopts an iterative level-wise search approach where k-itemsets are used to explore (k+1)- itemsets. It takes the advantage of the Apriori property to reduce the search space in order to improve the efficiency of level-wise generation of frequent itemsets.

B. Association Rule Mining Results The Apriori algorithm is applied to the dataset to unveil  association rules between pharmic qualities and chemical ingredients. Various experimental parameters have been tested and the best results are given in Table.I, with minimum support 0.4 and minimum confidence 0.75.

Table.I suggests that among the 60 major chemical ingredients, astragalin, sabinene, p-cymene, beta-pinene, beta- phellandrene, beta-bisabolence, and alpha-humulane are vital to the pharmic quality of traditional Chinese medicines. If an unknown medicine contains no such ingredient, it is very likely that its pharmic quality is cold. However, the associations between chemical ingredients of those "hot" medicines are far less obvious, and therefore we must use alternative classification approaches for judgments.



III. UNVEILING THE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN PHARMIC QUALITY AND INGREDIENTS  The above results demonstrate that there exist associations between the ingredients of traditional Chinese medicines and their pharmic qualities. Therefore, we apply decision tree mining to the above dataset in order to unveil the associations.

as well as give a quantitative analysis of the performance of association rule mining,  A. Decision Tree Mining A decision tree is a flow-chart-like tree structure where  each node denotes a test on an attribute value, and each branch suggests an outcome of the test, and the leaves represent classes or class distributions. It is widely used in categorical data but can also be applied to numeric data. A decision tree is usually generated from a given set of training samples, before being applied to classify new data.

beta- phellandrene=O, gamma-terpinene-O, beta-bisabolence=O, alpha-humulane=O  are the most widely used decision tree generation algorithm available. We use J48, a Java implementation of the C4.5 decision tree mining algorithm.

B. Perfornance Analysis  Fig.land .2 illustrate the result and performance of the J48 algorithm. Fig. 1 shows that the resulting tree is consistent with the association rules unveiled in the previous section.

Many of the ingredients from rule 1 in Table.Il (i.e. astragalin, beta-pinene, beta-phellandrene, beta-bisabolence, and alpha- humulane) appear as non-leaf nodes in the decision tree.

Given the ingredients of mint as in the above Table.II and the decision tree in Fig.l, we can easily judge that the pharmic quality of mint is "cold".

In the confusion matrix in Fig.2, a and b suggest cold and hot respectively. This confusion matrix suggested that 2 cold    Fig.l The decision tree obtained from mining  Fig.2 The performance of148 decision tree mining algorithm   TABLE II CHEJ'v:IICAL INGREDIENTS OF MINT Name Monecular Formula Value  Limonene C1oH16 0 oleic acid ClsH3402 0  myristic acid C14H2S02 0 ... ... ...

In addition, the ROC Area is 0.963 as given in Fig.2, suggesting that this decision tree model in Fig.l is fairly accurate. We then tested this model with another test set of 20 samples, and similar accuracy can be achieved, with only 2 hot samples are misjudged to be cold, and all the other 18 samples are correctly classified.



IV. FURTHER IMPROVEMENT  In search for higher accuracy of prediction on unknown medicines, we first consider alternative data mining approaches such as Bayesian classifier and its variant in AODE, before combing them with various performacne enhancement techniques.

A. Bayessian Classifier andAODE  Bayesian classifiers are statistical classifiers which can predict probabilities of class memberships, i.e. the probability of a given sample belongs to a particular class. The narve Bayesian classifier is based on the class conditional independence assumption which suggests that the effect of an attribute value on a given class is independent of the values of the other attributes. However, our preliminary experimental results suggest that the chemical ingredients of traditional Chinese medicines are not independent, and therefore a Bayesian classifier without such an independence restriction must be used.

Average One-Dependence Estimator (AODE) algorithm enhances the naive Bayesian classifier in that it weakens the independence assumption. For an item <xj,X2' ... Xi>, AODE classifies it into the category y where  It. ,. A  argmax( L P(y,xj)n P(Xj I y,x)) y i:l:S:i~nAF(xi )~m j=l  AODE assumes that feature A, at least depends on another feature Xi and that the category Y depends on Xi as well. A predefined threshold m is adopted in order to avoid inaccurate prediction of probabilities. Our experimental results show that it can effectively unveil the corelations between the chemical ingredients of traditional Chinese medicines with a high accuracy.

B. Performance Analysis Fig.3 demonstrates the performances of the Naive  Bayesian and the AODE classifiers. Among the 80 test cases, 34 hot medicines are correctly classified as "hot" and so are the 21 cold ones. However, there are 6 cold samples be    Fig.3 The performance ofNaive Bayesian classifier  FigA The performance of AODE classifier  === Detailed Accuracy By Class ===  TP Rate FP Rate Precision Recall F-Measure ROC Area Class  1 0.325 0.755 1 0.86 0.979 l: 0.675 0 1 0.675 0.806 0.979 f,t!

On the contrary, Naive Bayesian and AODE achieve an accuracy of 68.75% and 83.75% respectively. It is obvious that association rule mining outperforms these two alternative approaches.

C. Performance Enhancement Techniques  In pursuit for higher accuracy, we consider various performance enhancement techniques as outlined below.

(1) Bagging: in each classification iteration, each classifier is learned for each training set which is sampled with replacement from the original set of samples, beore being used to classify aan unknown sample. Its prediction is counted one vote. A bagged classifier C* is adopted to count the votes and assign the class with the most votes to this new sample.

(2) Adaboost: Adaboost (short for Adaptive Boosting) is a liner classifier whose output converges to the logarithm of likelihood ratio. It constructs a strong classifier as linear combination of multiple weak classifiers, which are assigned different weights in order to indicate their classification capabilities. It is a meta-algorithm, usually used in conjunction with many other learning algorithms to improve their performance. It is adaptive in the sense that subsequent classifiers built are tweaked in favor of those instances misclassified by previous classifiers.

(3) Stacking: the sample set is first partitioned into two datasets, namely held-in and held-out. The classifiers are then trained with held-in and their votes on held-out are combined (rather than chosen) by yet another classifier which generally provides better performance than any single classifier, as suggested by many prior works in related areas.

D. Performance Analysis after Enhancements  We combine decision tree techniques with the performance enhancement listed in the previous subsection, before evaluating their performances. The results are summarized in Table.Ill as given below.

On average, Naive Bayesian classifier achieves an accuracy of 68.75% when applied independently, which is relatively modest.

These above results hint that these chemical ingredients may not be independent. Therefore, we consider the AODE classifier as specified above and the results are given in Fig.4.

It shows that, among the 80 test cases, 40 hot medicines are correctly classified as "hot" and so are the all 27 cold ones.

However, there are only 13 hot cases misjudged as "cold". On average, it achieves an accuracy of 83.75%, which is significantly higher than that of the Naive Bayesian classifier.

This suggests that these ingredients are not independent indeed. However, this accuracy is still inferior to 92.5% of the decision tree approach, although with a slightly higher ROC area in 0.979, compared to 0.963 of the latter.

The corresponding ROC area (as shown in Fig.5) reaches 0.996, suggesting that this J48+Adaboost combination is a very effective classification approach in our traditional Chinese medicine analysis. However, it is still worth noting that, among all the 40 hot medicines, there are still 4 misjudged as "cold" by J48+Adaboost. In addition, there is only 1 among all 40 cold     Fig.5 The performance of148+Adaboost  samples are misjudged as "hot". For all the other 39+36=75 samples are correctly classified.

Therefore, we can confidently conclude that decision tree mining (J48) improved with Adaboost is the best classification approache among all candidates considered.



IV. RELATED WORK  Various modem approaches have been applied to investigate the association between ingredients of traditional Chinese herbs and their pharmic qualities. They can be roughly classified into two major categories. The first uses statistics and philology to archive historical books and documents of medical science in order to unveil the associations between the pharmic qualities. Alternatively, modem biological techniques are applied, aided by bio-chip techniques, model clinical medical science and bio-chemistry etc, in order to give a scientific interpretation of traditional Chinese medical science. However, neither approach makes a break-through because of its own hindrance in various aspects.

There has been a rich literature of published works in the application of modem data mining techniques to the study of traditional Chinese medicine in the past few years. Peng et.al[7] summarize the potential application domain for data mining in TCM, such as in diagnosis, chemical ingredient analysis of TCM, combined application of TCM prescriptions, expert system, and minining of TCM archives, etc. Similarly, Xu et.al.[ll] disucss the methodology and theoretical foundation for modem analysis of pharmic qualities of traditional Chinese medicines, but provides little insight of how to apply various techniques in practice. Tong et.al.[9] provide a concise survey of related works in this area.

However, it does not give an in-depth discussion about pros and cons of various data mining techniques in their applications, and therefore provide little useful hints to real works.

Deng et.al.[2] present a data mining software package for traditional Chinese medicine analysis, but their works mainly focus on the development methodology and software architecture aspects of the system instead of the mining techniques used. Similar works can be found in Mi[6], which discusses the development of DartSpora, an online data mining service platform that provides parallel and domain- concerned mining services for both practitioners and researchers.

Abraham et.al.[l] discussed how to use Naive Bayesian classifiers in medical analysis. Based on some quantitative results, it provides a comparison among various NB classifiers. We evaluate alternative mining techniques other than Bayesian classifier in our work. Lu et.al.[4] applied inter- dimensional association rule mining techniques to a traditional Chinese medicine chemical database which includes fields of TCM effects, family of plants, activities of chemical components and modem pharmacodynamics of medicine extracts. A series of strong rules have therefore been found.

Yang et.al[12] provides a case study of applying cluster analysis in ingredient analysis of one particular traditional Chinese medicine in gengsheng. It focuses on and provides an empirical study of seven different chemical ingredients within gengsheng. Zhu et.al.[14] propose a series of data processing methods (such as data reduction, cluster analysis and fuzzy set theory) to standardize the raw TCM data set in order to improve its quality for mining purpose, with a hope to explore new medicines. Tao[8] apply techniques such as association rule mining and decision tree to a data set of liver-related headache and get promising results. Lou[5] uses KDDD method to builde a human-computer itneraction model for TCM data mining and applied it to some long-established TCM archives. Experimental results show that it can unveil useful heuristics from these archives.



V. CONCLUSION  This paper presents our works on applying data mining techniques to research on traditional Chinese medicines. This is aim to unveil the underlying associations between chemical ingredients of these medicines and their pharmic qualities which are of vital importance in both research and practice.

Various approaches have been evaluated independently, and together with different improvement techniques, in order to answer the key questions listed in section I. We identify J48+Adaboost as the most accurate one among all these combinations. Our results can be used as a guideline for future researches on traditional Chinese medicine, particularly in the development of new medicines.
