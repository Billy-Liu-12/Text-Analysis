Determining the Factors of Affecting the Moodle Use by Using TAM.

ABSTRACT: A destructive earthquake happened in October 2011 in one of the cities at Eastern Region of our  country and it caused big damages in the city. All educational system affected negatively and university in the city had  to break down its education. It was even not possible to continue education because of huge damages and heavy  weather condition at city. In order to solve this problem, it was decided to use Moodle to continue education at the  university. All students and instructors except for the medical and dental faculties were obliged to use Moodle during  2011-2012 fall semesters. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the factors which might affect the  intention to use Moodle by university students using Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) in case of earthquake. A  survey method was used to collect data. Purposive sampling was used and 501 university students were participated in  the current study. The data were analyzed by using descriptive statistics and the proposed model was tested by using  structural equation model. The proposed model has seven constructs and nine hypotheses have been generated from the  connections among these seven constructs. Except for the one hypothesis, the model supported the entire hypothesis  proposed in the model. Implications and discussion are made in light of the results.

Anahtar s?zc?kler: Moodle kullan?m?, teknoloji kabul modeli, deprem    1. INTRODUCTION  Not only private but also governmental institution has been forced to use information  system (IS) for various purposes at their institution (Turel 2013). Actually, embedding the IS into  the institution is inevitable in this era. Course Management Systems (CMS), as an information  technology, has been widely used as a part of academic systems in higher education. There are  commercial course management systems such as Blackboard, WebCT and eCollege used by  several institutions (Ullman & Rabinowitz 2004). On the other hand, Moodle is one of the open  source CMSs for online learning. Moodle composed of many tools that can be used for creating  successful e-learning experiences in face to face instruction, distance education and blended  courses (Brandl 2005). Compared to Blackboard, it is found that every module or function except  for the discussion board of Moodle is favored by course participants (Unal & Unal 2011).

However, it is known that if the user fails to use the system, no matter what it is, commercial or  open source, it will not be fully utilized. Hence, it needs to be adapted by the students and the   **Assist.Prof.Dr. Yuzuncu Y?l University, Faculty of Education, Van-Turkey, keylem@gmail.com  mailto:keylem@gmail.com   Eylem KILI?     students? perceptions regarding the use and acceptance of the system should be investigated.

Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) developed by Davis (1989) aims to explain the effects of  system factors that have influence on user acceptance of information system through user  perception (Suh & Han 2002; Lingyun & Dong 2008). Perceptions are defined as an actual  interaction between instructional conceptions and a peculiar learning environment. Assessing  perceptions can give information about the actual use of learning environment (Lowyck, Elen &  Clarebout 2005).

1.1. Review of Literature  TAM has become one of the most widely used models in IS research. The reason for this is  that it is understandable and simple (King & He 2006). The TAM is widely-used in studies to  understand how users? beliefs and attitudes affect their technology usage intentions (Teo 2009;  Teo 2010; Teo & Noyes 2011; Teo et al. 2009; Venkatesh & Davis 2000). Based on the Theory  of Reasoned Action (TRA) (Ajzen & Fishbein 1980), the TAM explains how users? beliefs and  attitudes affect their intention to use a specific technological device by positing that technology  usage is determined by behavioral intentions to use a system that is in turn jointly determined by  the user?s attitude and perceived usefulness. Attitude is also jointly determined by perceived  usefulness and perceived ease of use. Lastly, perceived usefulness is influenced by perceived ease  of use and several external variables such as system features, training, documentation and user  support (Wong & Teo 2009; Teo 2009; 2010; Teo & Noyes 2011). The fundamental constructs of  user acceptance of a system is perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use (Chau 1996).

Attitude refers to the degree to which a user likes or dislikes using technology. Perceived  usefulness refers to the belief that the use of new technology will improve job performance and  productivity while perceived ease of use refers to the belief that the use of the new technology  does not demand considerable time and effort. In an extended TAM model, it is proposed that  perceived usefulness can be divided into two distinct types which are near ?term usefulness and  long-term usefulness. It was found that both constructs has a positive relationship with behavioral  intention (Chau 1996).

From the literature, the TAM has received considerable support and used in educational  settings to investigate various issues including: student acceptance of online courses, effective  learning tools, e-learning, gender differences in pre-service teachers, and pre-service teachers?  perceptions of computer technology in relationship to their intention to use computers (Dishaw &  String 1999; Lee et al. 2009). Stoel and Lee (2003) investigated the effects of student experience  with web based learning technology on the acceptance of web based courseware. It is found that  experience with the technology positively affects perceived ease of use. In an earlier study, it was  found that the user perceptions of ease of use, usefulness and usage have been affected with the  user computer experiences (Igbaria, Guimaraes & Davis 1995). The course website acceptance  was also investigated by using TAM (Selim 2003; Ramayan &Ignatius 2005). They found that  course website usefulness and ease of use are the key determinants of the acceptance and usage of  course website in learning technology.

In the context of the Moodle, Pavli? et al. (2011) proposed a theoretical model of  technology acceptance model based on qualitative findings of their studies. In another study, the  factors affecting acceptance and use of Moodle was investigated by TAM and it is found that the  actual use of Moodle depends on behavioral intentions and attitudes toward using Moodle  (?umak et al. 2011). Motivational factors such as technical support and perceived self-efficacy  was also investigated for web based system using TAM. It was found that technical support has a  direct effect on perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use (Sanchez & Heuros 2010;  Seferoglu 2007). In a recent study, the effects of perceived usefulness for the professor, perceived  compatibility for student tasks and training were investigated in the context of Moodle using  TAM. It was found that perceived usefulness for professor has effect on perceived usefulness and    Determining the Factors of Affecting the Moodle Use by Using TAM. The Story of a University after a Destructive Earthquake 171  intention to use, on the other hand, perceived compatibility with students has a positive  relationship with perceived ease of use, but there is no significant relationship between perceived  compatibility with student task and perceived usefulness (Escobar-Rodriguez & Monge-Lozano  2011). Even though several research studies were conducted with TAM and Moodle use, the  current study is the preliminary study to find out the appropriateness of Moodle use in case of  earthquake.

1.2. Research Model and Hypothesis  The purpose of this study was to investigate factors affecting the undergraduate students?  perceptions of Moodle using the technology acceptance (TAM) research model by structural  equation modeling (SEM) approach.  The following hypothesis guided the current study,  H1: There is a positive relationship between technical support and computer self-efficacy  H2: There is a positive relationship between computer self-efficacy and perceived ease of  use of Moodle  H3: There is a positive relationship between computer self-efficacy and perceived  usefulness of Moodle  H4: There is a positive relationship between perceived usefulness for professor and  perceived usefulness of Moodle  H5: There is a positive relationship between perceived usefulness for professor and  student?s Moodle usage intention  H6: There is a positive relationship between perceived ease of use and perceived  usefulness.

H7: There is a positive relationship between perceived ease of use and student?s attitudes  towards using Moodle.

H8: There is a positive relationship between perceived usefulness and student?s attitudes  towards using Moodle.

H9: There is a positive relationship between attitude toward use and student?s Moodle  usage intention                                   Figure 1.

METHOD  In this study, survey research design was used. The questionnaire was filled by the students  on courses in condensed education program in 2011-2012 fall semesters. The participants in this  study were 501 (n= 501) undergraduate students studying at Faculty of Engineering (n=84),  Higher National Diploma (n=22). Faculty of Science (n= 58), Faculty of Art (n=23), Faculty of  Agriculture (n=30) and Faculty of Education (n=231). The gender distribution of this sample  given in Table 1 was approximately similar. The participants' ages ranged from 18 to 25 years.

Most of the participants were senior (n=201) and sophomores (n=241). Most of the students?  experiences level is around intermediate and expert so it can be said that their computer and  Internet experiences were similar. Their computer experiences were intermediate (n=300) and  expert level (n=131). According to their Moodle experiences participants can be accepted as  novice (n=148) and intermediate (n=248) level after getting courses through Moodle. The number  of courses ranged from three to five (n=125) to five to eight (n=182).

Context and Procedure  A destructive earthquake happened in one of the cities in eastern region of Turkey in  October 2011 and it caused big damages in the city. All educational institutions were affected  negatively and the university in the city had to break down its education. The administrative staff  at the university decided to use Moodle to deliver the course content to all of the university  students, and then two week condensed education program was given to the students face to face.

Determining the Factors of Affecting the Moodle Use by Using TAM. The Story of a University after a Destructive Earthquake 173  All students and instructors, except the medical and dental faculty, were obliged to use Moodle  for teaching and learning purposes during 2011-2012 fall semesters. At this point, it is helpful to  provide some information about technological context of the university before the earthquake has  happened. Almost all faculties have computer laboratory and freshmen at all departments take  two computer courses which are mandatory in the university. However, it is really difficult to  claim that technological tools have been used for educational purposes at the university. Both  instructors and students do not have enough knowledge about technological tools that are being  used for educational purposes. Actually, it is the first time that the university has provided e-mail  address for the students, which has happened just after installing Moodle. Thus, it can be said that  the technological context of the university is weak. After installing Moodle, computer center  provided help by videos and documents on how to use Moodle for the instructors and the  students. Face to face training was also given to instructors.  Although some support was given to  the instructors and the students by computer support center, the instructors and the students faced  with many problems while using the Moodle. As a result, the purpose of this study was to find out  the acceptance of Moodle by the students when it is used in case of the earthquake.

2.2. Data Collection  Moodle Questionnaires: The questionnaire consisted of two parts. The first part consisted  of items related to student personal and academic data. The second part had 24 items related to  the each of the constructs included in the model. The survey items were measured using a five  point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The survey items were  developed based on the previous literature. The instrument was translated from English to the  other language by two expert having PhD degree in educational sciences. And then, an English  teacher translated it from the language to English. Minor changes were done and the survey was  rearranged for the current study. These 24 statements took part under the seven constructs: 1.)  Perceived usefulness (PU- four items), 2.) Perceived ease of use (PEU-three items), 3.) Attitudes  toward use (ATU-three items), and 4.) Behavioral intention (BI-three-items) were adapted from  ?umak et al. ( 2011). 5.) Computer self-efficacy (CSE-three items) items were developed for the  current study, 6.)  Technical support (TS-four items) was applied from a scale adapted by Igbaria  (1990) and 7.) Perceived usefulness for professor (PUP- four items) was taken from Escobar-  Rodriguez and Monge-Lozano (2011).

2.3. Data Analysis  Structural equations model (SEM) is a multivariate method composed of factor and  multiple regression analysis to estimate dependency relationships. Technically, the structural  equation modeling estimates unknown coefficients taking place in linear structural equations set.

In the equation system, directly observed variables and latent variables, which are related to  observed variables but not observed, usually take place. SEM assumes that there is a causal  structure among the latent variables set and observed variables are the explanatory of the latent  variables (Byrne 1998; Hayduk 1987; Joreskog & Sorbom 2001). SEM is followed with the  Maximum Likelihood estimation method, using the LISREL computer program. Therefore, a  Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) is carried out to evaluate the reliability and validity of the  measurement scales of all variables included in the proposed model. Once the measurement  model is validated, the causal model of structural equations is presented.

3. FINDINGS  The result of the CFA indicates that all standardized loadings exceeded 0.50. Fit criteria of  the model were calculated as 2 / 2.77df? ?  ; RMSEA=0,061; NFI=0,95; CFI=0,97;IFI=0.97  and AGFI=0,87. All these statistics supported the overall measurement quality for the constructs    Eylem KILI?     utilized in this study. It is indicated that if Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA)  value is equal or lower than 0,05 it means a good fit. On the other hand, if it is between 0,05 and  0,08 it shows sufficient fit level. In this study, RMSEA was found sufficient. Normed Fit Index  (NFI) gets values between 0 and 1. The higher the value of NFI the better the fit index is going to  be. The value of 0,95 shows a good fit. Comparative Fit Index (CFI) also gets values between 0  and 1. The value of 0,97 shows a good model fit based on independent model (?elik 2009).

Incremental Fit Index (IFI) values that exceed .90 are regarded as acceptable. Adjusted Goodness  of Fit Index (AGFI) values of 0,95 shows well fit (For model fit criteria, see Schermelleh-Engel,  Moosbrugger & M?ler 2003; Bryne 1998; J?reskog & Sorbom 2001). The coefficients of  Cronbach?s alpha for 7 constructs were ranging from 0,74 to 0,86 which are acceptable for the  study (Nunnally 1978). The Cronbach?s alpha of the survey was found 0, 92.  Additionally, the  Composite /Construct Reliability (CR) and the Average Variance Extracted (AVE), as presented  by Fornell and Larcker (1981), were calculated in order to determine whether the measurement  variable was representative of the related construct. Construct reliability is a reliability measure  based on the square of the total of factor loadings for a construct. AVE represents the overall  amount of variance in indicators accounted for by a construct. In Table 2, all AVEs were 0.050 or  higher, and exceeded the cutoff value of 0.050 (Fornell & Larcker 1981), and all CRs were 0.75  or higher and exceeded the cutoff value of 0,70 (Nunnally & Bernstein 1994).These results  supported the convergent validity of each of the constructs involved in the research model of this  study.

The Story of a University after a Destructive Earthquake 175  The structural model and hypotheses were tested by examining path coefficients and their  significance at the level of 0.05. Path coefficient was determined by calculating correlations  among constructs proposed in the model. As presented in Table 3, 8 out of 9 hypotheses  formulated within the scope of the research model were statistically confirmed. An H1  hypothesis, which is assumed to have had respectively a positive impact on CSE, was found to be  statistically significant. The impact of TS on CSE was 0.46.  This means that when technical  support offered for Moodle is increased one unit, the impact of this on CSE will be an average of  0.46 points. TS which are assumed to have affected CSE, caused the variation in CSE by  0.21%.The relationship between CSE, which is expressed in H2 and H3, and respectively PEOU  and PU latent variables were statistically significant. CSE mostly affected PU ( ?  = 0.58, t =  7.26), then PEOU ( ?  = 0.49, t = 8.12).  The relationship between PEOU and PU (H6), which are  formulated in classic TAM, was validated ( ?  = 0.24, t = 4.26). However, hypothesis H4, which  claim that PUP latent variable, has a positive effect on the perceived usefulness, was not  statistically validated ( ?  = 0.09, t = 1.90). On the other hand, as assumed in H5, the relationship  between PUP and BI was validated ( ?  = 0.44, t = 8.22).  PUP and ATU latent variables caused  the variation in behavioral intention by 37 %. Hypothesis H8, which claimed that there would be  a positive significant relationship between PU, which is one of the main hypotheses of the classic  TAM, and ATU, was confirmed ( ?  = 0.18, t = 3.16). The relationship between PEOU and ATU  was also validated ( ?  = 0.58, t = 9.16).  The impact of PEOU on ATU was 0.58. This means that  when perceived ease of use for Moodle is increased one unit, the impact of this on ATU will be  an average of 0.58 points. PEOU and PU latent variables caused the variation in attitude by 48 %.

In addition, CSE, PUP and PEOU latent variables caused the variation in perceived usefulness by  54 %.

DISCUSSION and RESULTS  The result of this study shows that Moodle provide opportunities for teaching and learning  process even in case of an earthquake. Although the technical infrastructure of the university is  weak and it is not possible to say that both the instructors and students were capable of using  technological tool effectively and efficiently, it can be concluded that the students have  behavioral intention to use the learning management system. The relationship between technical  support and computer self-efficacy was found significant in the current study. Most of the  students? experiences of Moodle were around intermediate after getting courses on Moodle.  This  might be the reason for the significant relationship that is being found between technical support  and computer self-efficacy in that they had never used Moodle before and so the support may  enhance their efficacy.

Eylem KILI?     The relationships among computer self-efficacy, perceived usefulness and perceived ease  of use was found significant and this result was consistent with the literature (Igbaria, Guimaraes  & Davis 1995; Ramayan &Ignatius 2005; Selim 2003; Stoel & Lee 2003). As pointed out by Teo  (2009), users? perceptions of their capability to use technology have a significant and  positive effect on their behavioral intention to use technology. Avc?-Yucel and Gulbahar (2013) review research studies conducted on TAM from 1999 to 2010 and they stated that  technological competency was found effective in four studies and it was found meaningful in  nineteen research studies. The only hypothesis that is not supported is the relationship between  perceived usefulness for the professor and perceived usefulness. The reason for this result might  be related to the inappropriate use of Moodle by the instructors. Most of the instructors used  Moodle simply uploading the course content to the system and they do not fully utilize the  features of the system. On the other hand, the relationship was found significant in the previous  study (Escobar-Rodriguez & Monge-Lozano 2011). The results of this study also show that  Moodle usefulness for professors affect their behavioral intention to use Moodle.

In conclusion, it is stated that cognitive, environmental and technological factors having  impact on users? acceptance and adoption of the ISs should be taken into account by designers of  e-learning for successful implementation (Teo, Wong, Thammetar & Chattiwat 2011).The study  provides additional evidence for the validation of TAM for Moodle platform by university  students in case of an earthquake. This study provides important implications for the acceptance  of Moodle and develops an understanding how to improve the utilization of learning management  system in higher education by the university students.

Uzun ?zet  2011 y?l?n?n Ekim ay?nda T?rkiye?nin do?usunda bulunan bir ilde b?y?k bir deprem ya?and?.

?ehirde b?y?k hasarlar meydana geldi ve ?ehirde y?r?t?len t?m e?itim faaliyetleri depremden olumsuz bir  ?ekilde etkilendi. Bu ?ehirde bulunan ?niversitede de e?itime ara verildi. Bu problemin ?stesinden gelmek  ve ??retime devam edilebilmek i?in ?niversite y?neticileri taraf?ndan ders y?netim sistemi olarak Moodle  kullan?lmas?na karar verildi. 2011-2012 g?z ve bahar yar?y?l? i?in e?itimin uzaktan yap?labilmesi i?in  Moodle kullan?lmas? kararla?t?r?ld?. T?p ve Di? Hekimli?i Fak?ltesi d???nda, t?m ??retim elemanlar? ve  ??rencilerin derslerin devam? i?in Moodle kullanmas? zorunlu tutuldu. Bu nedenle, bu ?al??man?n amac?  deprem sonras? ders y?netim sistemi olarak ?niversite ??rencileri taraf?ndan kullan?lan Moodle?un  kullan?m?n? etkileyebilecek fakt?rleri Teknoloji Kabul Modeli ?er?evesinde ara?t?rmakt?r.

Teknoloji Kabul Modeli (TKM) Davis (1989) taraf?ndan geli?tirilen ve kullan?c?lar?n teknoloji  kar??s?ndaki davran??lar? a??klamaya yarayan bir modeldir.  Bu model,  D???n?lm?? Eylem Teorisi (Theory  of Reasoned Action) ?zerine yap?land?r?lan ve bilgi sistemleri alan?nda en yayg?n kullan?lan modellerden  biridir. Teknoloji Kabul Modeli kullan?c?lar?n inan?lar?n?n ve tutumlar?n?n onlar?n teknolojik bir ?r?n?  kullanma niyetlerini nas?l etkiledi?ini a??klamaya ?al??maktad?r. Teknoloji kabul modeli e?itim alan?nda  ?e?itli konular? ara?t?rmak i?in kullan?lan bir y?ntemdir. Teknoloji Kabul modelinin temel bile?enleri  alg?lanan fayda ve alg?lanan kullan?m kolayl???d?r. Alg?lanan fayda veya yarar, kullan?lan yeni teknolojinin  i? performans?n? ya da verimini artt?raca??na olan inan?t?r. Alg?lanan kullan?m kolayl??? ise yeni teknolojik  ?r?nlerin kullan?m?n?n fazla zaman ve emek gerektirmeyece?i inanc?d?r. TKM?deki temel olan bu  bile?enler, yeni teknolojiye kar?? kullan?c?lar?n tutumunu, niyetini ve ger?ek davran??? a??klayaca??n?  varsaymaktad?r. Teknoloji kabul modelinin e?itim ve di?er alanlarda yayg?n bir ?ekilde kullan?lmas?,  davran???n a??klanmas?nda Teknoloji Kabul Modelinde farkl? de?i?kenler kullan?lmas?na sebep olmu?tur  Ara?t?rmada betimsel ara?t?rma y?ntemlerinden tarama modeli kullan?lm??t?r. Ama?l? ?rneklem  kullan?lm?? ve 501 ??renci ?al??ma grubunu olu?turmu?tur. Anket iki b?l?mden olu?maktad?r. Anketin  birinci b?l?m?nde demografik bilgilere ili?kin maddeler bulunurken ikinci b?l?mde 24 maddeden olu?an  likert tipi bir ?l?ek kullan?lm??t?r. Anketteki maddeler alan yaz?nda yap?lm?? ?al??malardan derlenmi?tir.

?l?ekte 7 fakt?r bulunmaktad?r. Bunlar: 1.) Alg?lanan fayda (4 madde),2.) Alg?lanan kullan?m kolayl??? (3  madde), 3.) Kullan?ma y?nelik tutum (3 madde 4.) Davran??sal niyet (3 madde), , 5.) Bilgisayar ?z  yeterlili?i (3 madde),  6.) Teknik destek (4 madde 7.) ??retim ?yeleri i?in alg?lanan fayda (4 madde).

Verilerin analizinde temel betimsel istatistikler ve ?nerilen modeli test etmek amac?yla yap?sal e?itlik  modellemesi kullan?lm??t?r.

Bu noktada ?niversitenin teknolojik alt yap?s? ve durumu hakk?nda bilgi vermek ?al??man?n  anla??lmas? ve ?nemi a??s?ndan yararl? olacakt?r. ?niversiteye devam eden ??rencilerin t?m? ilk y?llar?nda  zorunlu iki tane bilgisayara giri? dersi almaktad?r. Her fak?ltenin bir bilgisayar laboratuvar? bulunmaktad?r.

Ama yine de, ?niversitede e?itim ama?l? teknolojik ara?lar?n kullan?ld???n? s?ylemek olduk?a zordur.

?niversitede deprem ?ncesi, bir ders y?netim sistemi ve ??rencilere kurum taraf?ndan verilen bir mail  adresi bulunmamaktayd?. Hem ??retim ?yelerinin hem de ??rencilerin e?itim ama?l? teknolojik ara?lar?n  kullan?m?na ili?kin yeterli bilgi sahibi olduklar?n? da s?ylemek olduk?a zordur. Bu nedenle ?niversitenin  teknolojik durumunun zay?f oldu?u s?ylenebilir. ?niversitenin bilgi i?lem daire ba?kanl???, bu s?n?rl?l?klar?  g?z ?n?ne alarak hem ??renciler hem de ??retim ?yeleri i?in Moodle?? nas?l kullanacaklar?n? anlatan  k?lavuzlar yerle?tirmi?tir. Ayn? zamanda, ??retim ?yelerine Moodle kullan?m?na ili?kin seminerler  vermi?lerdir.

http://www.thejournal.com/articles/17014   Determining the Factors of Affecting the Moodle Use by Using TAM. The Story of a University after a Destructive Earthquake 179  Kat?l?mc?lar?n ?zelliklerine bak?ld???nda kad?n ve erkek oran?n?n birbirine ?ok yak?n oldu?u  bulunmu?tur. Kal?t?mc?lar ?o?unlu?u 20 ile 25 ya? aras?ndad?r. ?al??maya alt? farkl? fak?lteden ??renci  kat?lm??t?r. Bu kat?l?mc?lar?n ?o?u e?itim fak?ltesi ??rencisi (N=231 ki?i) olup ikinci (N=141 ki?i) ve  d?rd?nc? s?n?fa (N=201 ki?i) devam etmektedirler. Kat?l?mc?lar?n, bilgisayar tecr?belerine bak?ld???nda ise  ?o?unlu?unun bilgisayar tecr?besinin orta (N=300 ki?i) ve uzman (N=131 ki?i) seviyesinde oldu?u  bulunmu?tur. Moodle ?zerinden dersleri ald?ktan sonraki, Moodle tecr?belerine bak?ld???nda ise, acemi  (N=148 ki?i) ve orta d?zeyde (N=248 ki?i) oldu?u g?r?lm??t?r. Moodle ?zerinden ald?klar? dersler  soruldu?unda ise ??-be? aras? ders alan ??rencilerin 125 ki?i oldu?u, 5-8 aras?nda ders alanlar?n say?s?n?n  ise 182 oldu?u bulunmu?tur.

?nerilen modelde yedi fakt?r bulunmaktad?r ?nerilen fakt?rlerin fakt?r y?kleri ve g?venilirlik  katsay?lar? alan yaz?nda belirtilen kabul de?erleri aras?ndad?r. Modeldeki yedi fakt?r?n birbirleriyle olan  ili?kisinden dokuz tane hipotez geli?tirilmi?tir. Bu hipotezlerden birincisi teknik deste?in bilgisayar  ?zyeterlil?i ?zerinde pozitif bir etkisi oldu?u y?n?ndedir. Verilerin analizi sonucunda ?nerilen bu hipotez  desteklenmi?tir. Buna g?re, teknik destekte meydana gelen bir birimlik art?? bilgisayar ?zyeterlili?in de  0,46?l?k bir art??a neden olmaktad?r. ?kinci ve ???nc? hipotezde bilgisayar ?z yeterlili?inin alg?lana  kullan?m kolayl??? ve alg?lanan fayda ?zerinde pozitif bir etkisi oldu?u ?ng?r?lmektedir. Buna g?re,  modelde ?nerilen bu iki hipotezde desteklenmi?tir. Bilgisayar ?z yeterlili?i en ?ok alg?lanan fayday? daha  sonra ise alg?lanan kullan?m kolayl???n? etkilemektedir.  D?rd?nc? ve be?inci hipotez ise ??retim ?yeleri  i?in alg?lanan faydan?n alg?lanan fayda ve davran??sal niyet ?zerinde pozitif etkisi oldu?u y?n?ndedir.

Ancak, ??retim ?yeleri i?in alg?lanan faydan?n alg?lanan fayday? etkilemedi?i bulunmu?tur. Alt?nc? ve  yedinci hipotezlerde, alg?lanan kullan?m kolayl???n?n kullan?ma y?nelik tutum ve alg?lanan fayda ?zerinde  pozitif bir etkisi oldu?u y?n?ndedir. Buna g?re, alg?lanan kullan?m kolayl???ndaki bir birimlik art??  kullan?ma y?nelik tutumda 0,58?lik bir art??a neden olmaktad?r. Sekizinci hipotez, alg?lanan faydan?n  kullan?ma y?nelik tutum ?zerinde pozitif bir etkisi oldu?u y?n?ndedir. Bu hipotezde desteklenmi?tir.

Dokuzuncu hipotez, kullan?ma y?nelik tutumun davran??sal niyet ?zerinde pozitif bir etkisi oldu?u  y?n?ndedir. Buna g?re kullan?ma y?nelik tutumda ger?ekle?en bir birimlik art?? davran??sal niyette 0,36  birimlik bir art??a neden olmaktad?r. Modelde kullan?ma y?nelik tutumun % 48?ini alg?lanan kullan?m  kolayl??? ve alg?lanan faydan?n a??klad??? g?r?lmektedir. Ayr?ca, bilgisayar ?z-yeterlili?i, ??retim ?yeleri  i?in alg?lanan fayda ve alg?lanan kullan?m kolayl???, alg?lanan faydan?n %54??n? a??klamaktad?r.

Sonu? olarak, deprem gibi acil bir durumda ?niversite ??rencilerinin Moodle?u ders y?netim sistemi  olarak kullanmas?n? etkileyen fakt?rleri belirlemek amac?yla yap?lan bu ?al??mada sistemin kullan?m?nda,  alg?lanan kullan?m kolayl???, alg?lanan fayda ve tutumun etkili oldu?u bulunmu?tur. Ayr?ca, bilgisayar ?z  yeterlili?inin, alg?lanan fayday? b?y?k oranda a??klad??? g?r?lmektedir. ?al??mada desteklenmeyen tek  hipotez ??retim ?yeleri i?in alg?lanan fayda ile alg?lanan fayda aras?ndaki ili?kidir. Bunun nedeni, ??retim  ?yelerinin teknolojik ara?lar?n e?itimde kullan?m?na ili?kin yeterli bilgi sahibi olmamas? g?sterilebilir. Bir  ba?ka deyi?le ??retim ?yeleri Moodle?? sadece ders notu y?klemek i?in kullanm??lard?r buda ??rencide bu  t?r bir alg?ya neden olmu? olabilir. Teknoloji kabul modelinin deprem sonras?nda kullan?lan bir bilgi  sisteminin kullan?m?n? etkileyen fakt?rleri ortaya ??karmada da etkili oldu?u bu ?al??mada teyit dilmi?tir.

Bu durumda, Moodle?un ders y?netim sistemi olarak acil durumlarda yararlan?labilecek bir ortam oldu?u  s?ylenebilir.
