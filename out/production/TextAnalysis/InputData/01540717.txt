Mining Sequential Association-Rule for Improving WEB Document  Prediction

Abstract  Currently, researchers have proposed several sequential association-rule models for  predicting the next HTTP request. These researches focus on using sequence and temporal  constrains for pruning to improve prediction precision. In this paper, we provide a comparative  study on different kinds of sequential association rules for web document prediction. Firstly, we  give algorithms on mining sequential association rules, which is based on different sequence  and temporal constrains combination. Then, the performance of all such algorithms has been  compared on a real web log dataset. Based on the comparison, by the method of variance  analysis, we explore the effect of sequence and temporal information on influencing the  precision of prediction. We show that the sequence constrains, the temporal constrains and the  interaction between these two constrains can affect the precision of prediction. Furthermore,  temporal constrains can affect more than sequence constrains. These results show light on the  future research on improving the precisions of prediction.

KEYWORDS Sequential Association Rule, Web Usage Mining, Analysis of Variance  1. Introduction  Mining customer access and usage patterns on the web log is an important task, which can be  used to predict the HTTP request in the near future. Currently, many prediction models based  on different sequential association-rule mining have been proposed. They all use sequence and  temporal constrains to improving the performance of prediction. In this paper, we aim at further  improving the performance, so we need to explore how does sequence and temporal  information affect the precision of prediction. Firstly, we compare the precision of prediction  for different sequence association rule algorithms; Secondly, we use variance analysis to study  the influence of sequence and temporal information on improving precision. We show that the  interaction between the sequence information and temporal information can affect the  performance of prediction, and temporal constrains can affect more than sequence constrains.

Our method takes two steps. Firstly, we mine usage patterns; and secondly, we build  predictive models based on these usage patterns. In the first step, we mine several kinds of  sequence association rules. And specifically, we mine association patterns that are constrained  sequentially and temporally. In the second step, we use a rule based predictive model [12],  which always chooses a rule with the highest confidence among all the applicable association  rules.

The rest of this paper is organized as following. Section 2 reviews the literature in related  research; Section 3 presents the notion of sequence constrain and temporal constrain, and the      sequential association rule mining algorithm, which is based on the possible combination of  these two constrains; Section 4 provides experimental results on one public available web log  dataset and the Analysis of Variance of these results; Section 5 concludes this paper and present  our ongoing work.

2.  Related works  To discover usage patterns, several approaches such as collaborative filtering via clustering,  Markov model of sequential navigation, and association mining have been proposed in the  literatures [2][4][6][7].

Collaborative filtering [8] uses consumer specific historical data to classify users into  different category so that the users in each category have similar interests or buying patterns.

Then it uses these categories to predict users? future interests by referencing their group. One  limitation of this approach is that it can be quite inefficient, especially for web sites where the  number of physical web pages is quite large. Furthermore, when user identities are hidden, this  technique can lead to inaccurate predictions. While some approaches, which are based on the  off-line clustering of page accesses and the use of dimensionality reduction[6], have been  suggested to overcome these limitations, these approaches are still quite expensive.

Techniques that rely on sequential patterns contain more precise information about users?  navigation behavior. Techniques that fall into this class include methods that rely on statistical  models such as Markov models, sequential pattern mining and association rules mining  [4][9][10][11]. These approaches also suffer from the problems that the size of rule set  generated could be exceedingly large and therefore need to be pruned so as to make it effective  [4][13]. Temporal and sequential information are main approaches [4][5] for pruning rules,  which improve the scalability and precision of online recommendation system. However, the  effect of these pruning approaches has not yet been explored comparatively. In [3], Qiang Yang  compared many sequential association rule algorithms. A crucial difference between the  approach we discuss in the next section and Qiang Yang?s work is that, they compared the  algorithms which have been present before, whereas we explore the effect of sequence and  temporal constrains on influencing the performance of prediction. Furthermore the methods are  quite different.

3. Mining prediction rules Here, we define sequential and temporal constraints. By applying combination of different  sequence and temporal constraints, our algorithm can mine different sequential association  rules sets, which have different ability for prediction.

Definition 1 Web Transaction: A web transaction is denoted by 1 2 mWT={WA ,WA , WA } ,  iWA is a web-page access where each web access is draw from WP , the set of all web pages (in  a given website).

Definition  2   Web Log: A web log is a set of web transactions, and it can be represented  as 1 2 nWL={WT ,WT , ,WT } .

Definition 3  Rule: A rule is defined as 1 2 m-1 mRULE=(WA ,WA , ,WA WA ) .

Definition 4  Position: Let WA  be a HTTP request, and 1 2 nWT={WA ,WA , WA }  be a web  transaction, if iWA WA ( 1,2 )i m? = , m+1WA=WA ( 1 )m n+ ? , then we say the position of WA in WT  is m+1.

Definition  5   Rule Distance: Let 1 2 nWT={WA ,WA , WA } be a web transaction and  i1 i2 im-1 imRULE=(WA ,WA , ,WA WA )  be a rule, if WT  contains all items in the rule and the  positions of ik,WA (k=1,2, ,m) in transaction WT are 1 2 m(j ,j , j ) . Suppose after sorting 1 2 m(j ,j , j ) ,      we get 1 2 mn n n  (j ,j , j ) , with 1 2 mn n n  j <j j .< < , then i i-1n n  max{ j -j ,i=2, ,m} is rule distance of RULE  with  respect to WT .

For example, for a web transaction WT={A,B,C,D,E,F}  and a rule RULE=(A,C D) , WT  contains each item in the rule. The positions of items A,C,D  in WT  are1,3,4  separately. Sorting  1,3,4 , we get 1,3,4 . Then the absolute value of difference of consecutive items is {2 1}. The  maximum of these absolute values is 2. So, the rule distance of this rule given the transaction  WT  is 2.

Definition  6  Order Distance: Let 1 2 m-1 mRULE=(WA ,WA , ,WA WA )  be a rule, and  i1 i2 inWT=(WA ,WA , ,WA )  be a transaction, with WT  contains all items in the rule. Suppose  sequence j1 j2 jm(WA ,WA , ,WA )  is found by sorting the sequence 1 2 m-1 m(WA ,WA , ,WA ,WA )  according to the positions of iWA ,(i=1,2, ,m) in transaction WT. Then the minimum exchanges,  which is required by turning the sequence j1 j2 jm(WA ,WA ,```WA )  into sequence  1 2 m-1 m(WA ,WA , ,WA ,WA ) , is the order distance of the rule RULE  with respect to the transaction  WT .

For example, let WT={A,B,C,D,B,F}   be a web transaction, and RULE=(A,D C)   be a rule.

WT  contains all the items in RULE . For items  ( A,D,C ) in RULE , the sequence ( A,C,D ) could  be found according to the order of items in transaction WT . Then the minimum exchanges  required to turn the sequence ( A,C,D ) into the sequence( A,D,C ) is 1. Hence, the order distance  of RULE  with respect to transaction WT is 1.

When mining association rules, once the frequent k-itemsets(k>2) have been determined, for  each itemset we can generate 1  k i  k ii C C  = association rules,   k i  ki p  = sequential association rules  involving a single consequent. When temporal and sequential constrains are used for pruning,  the number of rules could be reduced greatly.

Figure 1 shows the pseudo-code of the algorithm that can generates several kinds of  sequential association rules set according different combination of sequence and temporal  constrains. Firstly, we input the frequent itemstes mined by Apriori algorithm [14], rule  distance threshold, order distance threshold, and support threshold; then, for each sequential  association rule and each transaction in the training dataset we compute the rule distance and  order distance; finally, we prune all sequential association rules by the sequence constrains and  temporal constrains, and output the final set of sequence association rules.

Algorithm: PruninSequenceAssociation  Input:  ItemSetTree  // contains all frequent itemsets mined by the algorithm in [14]  MinSupp  // support threshold  MaxRuleDis  // rule distance threshold  MaxOrderDis // order distance threshold  Output:  ruleSet // output sequence association rules set  Begin:  Foreach  itemset iS contained in ItemSetTree // generate all sequence association rules  Rules=sequenceRule( iS );                           // involving a single consequent for iS  Foreach transaction T  in Dataset{  Foreach rule L in Rules{    //if the set of items in transaction T contains the set of  If(ItemsContain(T,L)){// items in rule L  If((OrderDis(T,L)<=MaxOrderDis )And(RuleDis(T,L)<=MaxRuleDis)){  Increase L?s support by 1;  }  }      }  }  Foreach rule L in Rules{  If(support(L)>= MinSupp){  Output rule L;  }  }  Figure 1.  Algorithm for mining sequence association rules  When order distance and rule distance both are infinite, the algorithm we present is an  association rule mining algorithm. When order distance is 0 and rule distance is infinite, the  algorithm is the subsequence mining algorithm [3]. When order distance is 0 and rule distance  is 1, the algorithm is latest-substring mining algorithm [3].

Whichever parameter is used, once the rules have been generated by our algorithm, they can  be used for predict the next HTTP request for a transaction. Firstly, we try to match the left  hand of each rule with the transaction. When matching a transaction, order distance and rule  distance criteria must be satisfied. Then, the rule with highest confidence among the list of  matched rules is used to predict next HTTP request. For instance, if the transaction has involved  accessing A,C,D,E  in that order, and the rule distance is 1, then the rule A,E X  does not match  the given transaction. The reason is that rule distance of A   and E  is 3.

4. Experimental results and analysis We employ a real data set clarknet_access_log_Aug28.gz for our experiment [1]. The  log was collected from Aug. 28, 1995 to Sep. 3, 1995. In this period, there were totally  1654882 HTTP requests. The size of the dataset is 168M. We use the method described in  [2] for preprocessing. After data preprocessing, we have 98888 transactions and 88137  different IP addresses. Then, the set of transactions has been divided into two datasets and  each one is divided again into a training set and a testing set. The number of transactions in  training set and testing set is 37063 and 12361, respectively.

We carried out the experiment on a PC with 4 2.4P G /256M windowsXP/jdk1.4.2/. MinSupp is set to 2.5%, Table 1 present the precision of prediction when we tried to predict the sixth  HTTP request in the transactions of test set.

Two-way  analysis of variance may be used to examine the effects of two categorical variables (factors),  both individually and interaction on an experimental response. We use A  and B  to denote  order distance and rule distance.

Suppose we execute c  experiments under condition ( , )k lA B , the result can be expressed by  , 1, , ,kljX j c= 1, , 1, ,l q k p= = .we assume , 1, , , 1, , 1, ,kljX j c l q k p= = = is independent  variables and has 2( , )klN u ?  distribution respectively; kl k l klu u ? ? ?= + + + where ,( 1, , )k k p? = expresses the effects of the factor A in level p , , ( 1, , )l l q? =  expresses the effects of      factor B in q levels respectively, kl? ( 1, , , 1, , )k p l q= =  expresses interactions between factors  ,A B  at different levels; klu  fulfils 1 1 1 1 0, 1, , , 1, ,  p q p q  k l kl klk l k l k p l q? ? ? ?  = = = = = = = = = = .

Hence, to estimate the effects of ,A B and interactions between A  and B  is to test  hypotheses: 01: 1 2 0pH ? ? ?= = = = 02: 1 2 0qH ? ? ?= = = = 03: 0,klH ? = for all 1, , , 1, ,k p l q= =  In order to test these hypotheses, we decompose sum of squares Q .

, 1, , , 1, ,  c  kl kljj X X k p l q  c = = = ,  1 1 1  ,  p q c  kljk l j X X  pqc = = =  Then we calculate mathematical expectation of 1Q , 2Q , 3Q  and 4Q .

Let?s define variable   1 1  ,  S Q  p ?  2 2  ,  S Q  q ?  3 3  ,  ( 1)( 1) S Q  p q? ?  4 4  ,  ( 1) S Q  pq c ?  then: 2 2 2 2 2 21 21 1( ) , ( )( 1) ( 1)  p q  k lk l  qc pc E S E S  p q ? ? ? ?  = = = + = +  ? ? , 2 2 23 1 1( ) ( 1)( 1)  p q  klk l  c E S  p q ? ?  = = = +  ? ? 2 2  4( )E S ?= So 24S  is a unbiased estimate of  2? . But iff 01: 1 2 0pH ? ? ?= = = =  is true,  1S  is  a unbiased  estimate of 2? , otherwise the mathematical expectation  of 21S  is greater than 2? . That is to say,  when 01: 1 2 0pH ? ? ?= = = =  is violated , the statistic   A  S F  S is greater. Hence we can use  AF  to test 01H .

In the same way , we can use the statistic   B  S F  S to test  02H use   AB  S F  S to test  03H .

Using the formulas and experiment data, we can get the table2 of Analysis of Variance.

For  degrees of freedom (2,12) and 0.01? = , we obtain the critical value 6.9F? = .  For degrees of freedom (3,12) and 0.01? = , we obtain the critical value 6.0F? = .

That is to say, sequence and temporal constrains, the interaction between  these two variable can affect the precision of prediction.

Finally, we use Matlab and data in table 1 for fitting curves. Among linear model, interaction  model, pure quadratic model and full quadratic model, full quadratic model produces the best  fitting curves for experimental data. The curve is 2 2  1 2 1 2 1 265.396 9.19 6.04 0.196 0.34 0.49y x x x x x x= ? ? + + + .

In the equation  1 2,x x are Rule Distance and Order Distance separately, %y  is the precision of  prediction. From the formula, we can see that the precision will increase, when 1x  reduce  and 2x is a constant and vice versa. Clearly when 1 2,x x  are small, 1x  has more impact than 2x on  influencing y .

5. Conclusion  In this paper, we explore the effect of sequence and temporal information on influencing the  performance. We show that the sequence constrains, the temporal constrains and the interaction  between them can affect the performance of prediction, and the temporal information based  methods can affect more than the sequence information based methods. So, if we want to  improve the performance of web document prediction, these relations should be embodied in  the algorithm. For example, we can improve the performance by some certain algorithms,  which is presented by given different weight to sequence constrains and the temporal  constrains, so as to capture the relationship. And this is our ongoing work.
