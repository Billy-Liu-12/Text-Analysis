A Hybrid Decision Support System for Storage Location Assignment   in the Fast-Fashion Industry

Abstract--In the highly competitive market of the fast-fashion  industry, the fashion trend keeps on changing rapidly while customers always chase after new fashionable products. To meet customers' expectation and to cater for seasonal demand fluctuation, the product life cycle becomes shorter. The result of this is that frequent delivery of new products from the distribution center to the fashion retailers is necessary. This puts extra pressure on the warehouse of the fashion retailer, in which a large number of fashion products of different sizes have to be handled within a limited period of time. Due to the lack of an appropriate storage location assignment strategy, fashion products are always stored randomly, which increases the difficulties of picking the designated products. This results in low warehouse operations efficiency. In this paper, a decision support system for facilitating hybrid storage location assignment decisions is proposed to improve the warehouse operations by considering the fashion product characteristics and the order picking patterns. By integrating the class-based storage assignment policy and association rule mining, the fashion products are classified into different classes and stored according to the correlation between products. Through conducting a pilot study in a retailer store, it was found that the systematic storage location assignment strategy improves the order picking efficiency in terms of shorter travel distance.



I. INTRODUCTION   With time-based competition of shorter cycle times in the fashion market, fast fashion has become a trend of the fashion industry in recent years. The concept of fast fashion is to reduce the lead times for getting new fashion product into stores, in order to satisfy consumer demand in the peak season [1]. As the product life cycle becomes shorter and shorter, the cycle time from the centralized distribution center to retail distribution centers is also reduced. Facing the challenges of customers? changing expectations and seasonal demand fluctuation in the fast-fashion apparel industry, apparel companies need to quickly respond to the fast operation procedures of fashion products, especially at distribution centers which supply retail stores [2].

However, frequent delivery of new products from distribution centers to the retailers' stores brings increasing pressure to the warehouse of fashion retailers, in which large amounts of fashion products of different sizes have to be handled in a limited period of time. Due to the lack of an appropriate storage location assignment strategy, fashion products are always stored randomly, without a systematic warehouse storage layout. This will increase the difficulties of picking designated products. This results in low warehouse operations efficiency of fashion stores. As there is no systematic warehouse storage policy and proper order picking  policy, the warehouse operators need to travel back and forth several times in order to search for the required products.

Thus, the travelling distance and total picking time increase which affects the warehouse performance. Therefore, in this paper, a hybrid decision support system for storage location assignment (SLA-DSS) is proposed to improve the warehouse operations by considering the fashion product characteristics and the order picking patterns.



II. LITERATURE REVIEW  A. Overview of fast fashion Industry  In the fierce time-based competition in the fast-fashion markets, the product life cycle is becoming shorter.

Businesses have to quickly react to changes in the market for the purpose of maintaining their market share [3]. A fast response to changing fashion trends and consumer demand is the main focus of retailers in the fast-fashion industry [4].

Delay in time will lead to a greater risk of stocks being obsolescent and there will be less time in which to make a profit [5]. Due to such time pressure, lead-time is critical in managing the supply chain of fashion products [6]. It is especially true for the retailers' stores which need to handle large quantities of products for sale in a short period of time.

This brings pressure to the warehouse of retailers and therefore effective warehouse management is important to ensure that the store can respond quickly to fulfill customer demand.

B. Warehouse storage and picking management  According to Gu et al. [7] and Hou et al. [8], there are three fundamental decisions when dealing with the storage function in warehouse management: i) what is the quantity of stock keeping unit (SKU) that need to be kept in the warehouse; ii) what is the frequency and time needed to perform a replenishment for an SKU?s inventory; iii) where should the SKU be allocated, stored, distributed and moved to from among different storage areas. The storage location assignment problem is to allocate incoming products to storage locations in storage warehouses or zones for the purpose of lowering material handling cost and improving space utilization [9]. An appropriate storage location assignment helps to minimize total travelling time, or travelling distance, for order pickers in the warehouse. There are three major types of storage policy: random storage, class?based storage and dedicated storage. The concept of random storage is to randomly assign all incoming products to any available empty location in a warehouse [10]. This method is only applicable in a warehouse which is equipped   2013 Proceedings of PICMET '13: Technology Management for Emerging Technologies.

with a computerized system to keep track of the location assigned to each product. The random storage policy results in high space utilization because every feasible empty space in the picking area can become a candidate to store any incoming product [11]. Class?based storage assignment policy is a hybrid type of random and dedicated storage policy [7][12]. ABC theory is the usual method to divide the items into three classes according to Pareto?s Law. Pareto?s Law is based on the popularity of the SKU to decide on the storage location in warehouses. According to Mulcahy and Sydow [13], the law reveals that 85% of the volume shipped to customers accounts for 15% of the SKUs. The travel distance can be reduced, as each zone location is assigned with items according to their popularity. A Dedicated storage policy requires products to be stored in a fixed location [14].

Every SKU is assigned to a unique storage location. This policy requires sufficient spaces for every product to be reserved for the purpose of storing the maximum inventory level. Therefore the space utilization is the lowest among all storage policies.

Besides the storage assignment policy, order picking is also considered as an important factor that affects the performance of a warehouse. In general, order picking is defined as the process of retrieving the required goods from a storage location upon the request of a customer [15]. It has been recognized as the most labor-intensive and costly activity for warehouses. As a consequence, warehouse managers pay more attention to this aspect in order to minimize the throughput time of picking an order while maximize the use of space, equipment and labor as well as the accessibility to all items. It is important to consider storage assignment policy when designing and controlling an effective order picking system so as to improve the warehouse performance [16].

C. Data mining and association rule  Data mining is the process of extracting unknown and potentially useful patterns, trends and rules from stored historical data for business promotion, decision making or classification [17]. Association rule mining is one of the data mining approaches to find out the hidden important information for product storage that gives the minimum support and the minimum confidence constraints. Some previous researches also considered adopting association rule mining to group the storage items in the warehouse for efficient retrieval. Chen et al. [18] proposed grouping the picking orders into batches with association rule mining to decrease the travel distance and time within the storage zone.

To facilitate the storage location assignment problem, Chan et al. [19] suggested that association rule mining can determine the correlated products storage location effectively and minimize the total travel distances of both order picking and put-away operations in a randomized warehouse. Chen and Wu [20] proposed an association-based clustering approach by consolidating small orders into batches so that they can be picked at the same time. Xiao and Zheng [21]  designed a correlated storage assignment system by considering demand dependences of stored items based on association rule mining to minimize zone visits for materials picking in production line. However, association rule mining can only find the hidden correlations of products and store the highly correlated products closely to reduce the travel distance. It cannot classify the products into different groups according to their turnover rates and popularity. Therefore, by integrating the class-based storage assignment policy and association rule mining, the fashion products are classified into different classes and stored according to the correlation between products. The warehouse operations performance can be improved with reduced travel distance.



III. ARCHITECTURE OF SLA-DSS   To improve the warehouse operations, a hybrid decision support system for storage location assignment (SLA-DSS) is proposed which incorporates the consideration of fashion product characteristics and the order picking patterns. Figure 1 shows the system architecture of SLA-DSS, which consists of three modules. They are (i) data collection module, (ii) items storage analysis module and (iii) association rule mining module.

A. Data Collection Module  Data such as the warehouse layout, existing production location, products? volume, replenishment volume, required products in the order picking lists, order picking density, and order picking time are collected. These data are then filtered to distinguish the useful data from the mass collected data and are stored in the database.

B. Item Storage Analysis Module  In order to classify the fashion products into different classes, the ABC classification concept, based on the COI index and EIQ analysis, is introduced to divide the products into a fast moving class, a medium moving class, and a slowing moving class. The fast moving class and medium moving class account for about 60% and 30% of the total turnover of the product respectively. The remaining percentage of turnover is counted as belonging to the slow moving class. The COI index is the ratio of the maximum allocated storage space to the number of storage/retrieval operations per unit time. EIQ is a statistical analysis to obtain planning information based on the order quantity from each customer (EQ), the number of items ordered by each customer (EN), the order quantity of each item (IQ) and the frequency of order of each item (IK). According to EIQ analysis, items in a warehouse can be classified into 3 classes.

Each class should have a designated location and space requirement in order to assign the items.

Figure 1 ? System Architecture of SLA-DSS  C. Association Rule Mining Module  Since the COI Index and EIQ analysis do not take into consideration the correlations between different items, association rule mining, using an Apriori algorithm, is applied for the purpose of mining the logical dependency between different items when items need to be picked from order picking lists. The relationship between items is represented in the form of If-Then rules. Travel distance of picking can be reduced when the required items are placed close to each other as the pickers do not need to walk along the whole aisle to pick the items.

D. New Storage Layout  Since apparel products can be divided into different categories, similar products should be grouped into the same category and stored in the same rack in order to make it easy for warehouse operators to recognize the products. Therefore, the across aisle storage method is adopted where A-items, which belong to the fast moving class, should be placed close to the I/O point while the C-items, which belong to the slow moving class, should be located on the least accessible storage locations.

IV. CASE STUDY  A. Company Background  RLC is a luxury clothing company founded by an American fashion designer. It specializes in high-end casual wear, accessories and fragrances. In order to expand its business in Asian countries, RLC has opened an outlet store in Hong Kong which sells mainly three main categories of products for men, women and kids. The store is divided into two main parts which are the floor area and the warehouse area. The floor area is where the daily selling activity is performed while the warehouse area is where the functions of storage and the refilling of products to the floor area take place. As the sales of the men?s products make up the greatest proportion of the monthly sales, this study focuses only on the warehouse operations to do with men?s products to improve its performance.

B. Existing problem  Generally, the RLC warehouse requests for stock replenishment once a week and the replenishment items arrive at the store on two separate days. After performing quality checking, the warehouse operators then store the incoming items in the storage location randomly, provided that there is an empty rack. Therefore, different categories of product can be found on the same rack. This reduces the efficiency of the order picking as warehouse operators have to spend lots of time to search for the products they need. On the other hand, the same products are also located on different racks, and the pickers are confused about the exact location of the required products. Figure 3 illustrates the storage problem of coexistence of different item categories in the same racks because of the implementation of random storage location policy. Besides, there is no items classification in the current practice. The fast-moving items may be located far away from the I/O point while the slowing-moving items may be occupying highly accessible      Figure 3 ? Coexistence of different item categories   2013 Proceedings of PICMET '13: Technology Management for Emerging Technologies.

locations. Pickers are required to travel a long distance in order to finish a picking order. Thus, the SLA-DSS is implemented in the RLC warehouse with the aim to develop a more efficient, systematic and user-friendly warehouse storage layout which can also minimize the traveling distance of pickers.

C. Implementation of SLA-DSS in an RLC warehouse  To apply SLA-DSS in an RLC warehouse, 45 order picking lists with 122 items in total were collected from the RLC store on 5 working days in January and February of 2012. The collected data had to be selected and processed in order to make those data able and ready for analysis. The COI index and EIQ analysis were used to construct the ABC classification which helps the users to distinguish the products into fast-, medium-, and slow-moving items. Then, ARM was introduced to mine the correlation between different products when the order picking activity was required.

(i) ABC Classification based on the COI index  The COI index of each item is the ratio of storage space it requires to the order picking frequency of the item. By calculating the COI value of each item, the fast-moving items can be distinguished from the medium- and slow-moving items. Items with lower COI value are classified as A-item and should be stored in the best location while items having higher COI value should be classified as C-items and be allocated to locations with the lowest accessibility.

(ii) ABC Classification based on EIQ Analysis  EIQ Analysis is also used to divide the items into different classes. As the study is aimed at identifying the classes of each item, only the IQ and IK analyses are regarded as useful data. EQ and EN analyses cannot provide much more useful information than IQ and IK analyses regarding the importance of the items because the EQ and EN only highlight the quantity of orders and the number of items within each order. The order quantity of each item and the picking frequency of each item are more useful for ABC classification in RLC warehouses. It should be noticed that the items shown in IQ with higher picking quantity are more likely to be picked more frequently. Therefore, it can be concluded that the analyses of IQ and IK are consistent with each other.

After the formation of ABC classification from IQ and IK, the results need to be compared with the COI index which was established before. It is found that the IK analysis has a lower total COI index on the Class A items than the IQ analysis. Therefore, the classification based on the IK analysis is adopted. It shows that 9 items are regarded as Class A, 42 items and the remaining 31 items are assigned to Class B and Class C respectively.

Figure 4 ? Order quantity of each item in descending order      Figure 5 ? Number of orders of each item in descending order   (iii) Association Rules Mining (ARM)  As the correlation between items is not considered with the COI Index or the EIQ analysis, the storage assignment of items may not be the optimal solution based on the above constructed ABC Classes. When assigning the location of the items, the relationship between items should be considered.

Data mining software, namely Weka 3, is used for computation of the collected data to generate the association rules. The minimum support count is set as 0.55 (55%) and the minimum confidence level is 0.9 (90%). It is found that seven items have strong correlation when order picking is required. They are custom pink mesh [M07], navy hoody [M39], green hoody [M40], black watch cardigan [P10], pink blue and while double striped shirt [P18], navy and white mesh [L05], and black Perry jacket [P16].

(iv) Proposed warehouse layout  According to the results based on the COI index, EIQ and ARM, the 122 items can be assigned to the appropriate storage locations. The proposed storage locations are illustrated in Figure 6. Items can be grouped into the same category based on the result of ABC classification and association rules.

V. RESULT AND DISCUSSION  A. Comparison of travel distance with SLA-DSS  After rearranging the storage location of these 122 items as proposed in the storage layout, all the travel distances of the selected order picking lists are reduced by different percentages. Table 1 shows the comparison of travel distance from 8 order picking lists. The greatest reduction on travel distance is 55.7% where the travel distance decreases from 65.7m to 29.1m. Order pickers can finish the order faster and they will have more time for doing other value-added activities. It should be noted that the overall improvement on travel distance is still remarkable as there is over 30% improvement.

B. Advantages of proposed system  Unlike the random storage assignment policy, the SLA-DSS formulates the items? storage location based on the  COI and EIQ analysis. Fast moving items are allocated to the most accessible places while the slow moving items are assigned to the places which are far away from the I/O point.

The classification of items is based on the value of COI accompanied with EIQ analysis. These two methods provide warehouse users with systematic procedures to follow. The storage of incoming items is now logically assigned, resulting in a consistent storage layout.

Besides, warehouse operators may have difficulty in finding the required items when those items are randomly stored. The new layout provides a consistent layout where items are logically grouped and stored according to their COI value and the results of EIQ analysis. The popular ones are stored near the I/O point which can definitely lower the travel distance of an order. In addition, related items are assigned as close as possible by the result of association rule mining in order to reduce the travel distance.

VI. CONCLUSION   With shorter cycle time in fast fashion industry, efficient and effective warehouse operation in retail shops is necessary to achieve customer satisfaction. If new fashion products are stored randomly without a systematic warehouse storage layout, it is difficult to locate and pick the designated product when needed. The customer may need to wait for a long time until the operator can pick the products for him. Loss of sale revenue may result due to inefficient order picking policy with long waiting time. This paper presents a hybrid decision support system for storage location assignment integrates a class-based storage assignment policy and association rule mining approach to facilitate the storage and picking operations in the fast fashion industry. Firstly, cube-per-order index (COI) of products' values is generated to indicate the importance of those items. After that, EIQ analysis is applied to determine the classes of those selected items based on the total inventory turnover. With the classification of products, association rules mining is further introduced to find the possible relations between picked items. Hence, the storage layout is suggested and the results show that the hybrid layout does provide significant reduction in travel distance when an order picking activity is performed. This system is specifically beneficial to fashion warehouses which do not have any storage assignment policy, but need to handle large variety of fashion products frequently. Through applying the SLA-DSS, systematic warehouse storage layout is provided based on the class of product and the relationship among different products. Thus, warehouse operators do not need to waste most of the time in search the required items, but they can help to support marketing activities which can further increase the sales revenue. Future research might include the application of artificial intelligence techniques, such as Genetic Algorithms, to search for the optimal picking and routing plan.
