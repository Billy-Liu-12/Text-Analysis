Improved Weighted Code Mapping for Buses with Non Uniform Data Distribution   Siamak Mehrnami, Mahdi Moradinasab and Rasul Yousefi  Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran  s.mehrnami@ece.ut.ac.ir     Abstract?By scaling the technology, wiring has a big  share of overall circuit capacitance and consumes a considerable part of dynamic energy. In digital circuits, buses become important part of wiring and their energy dissipation become comparable to the total circuit energy. So we are interested in lowering this energy, especially for low power and portable applications. On the other hand crosstalk noise and peak power problems due to coupled capacitances of adjacent wires should be considered. In this paper we introduced an improved algorithm of Weighted Code Mapping (WCM) for non uniform distributed data.

With a small hardware addition to bus terminals as encoder and decoder we can reduce both power consumption and cross-talk capacitances considerably and avoid peak power problems.

I. INTRODUCTION  Power consumption in VLSI circuits consists of static and dynamic power consumptions. Static power consumption is due to non ideal characteristics of transistors such as leakage and sub-threshold currents.

Dynamic power consumption is due to switching activity.

In deep sub micron technologies wiring of buses has a big capacitive load and becomes the main term in dynamic power dissipation. In recent years many methods introduced to decrease bus's energy dissipation. Some authors proposed special circuit configuration in order to save energy or avoid delay [1], [2]. Some of them introduced bus encoding techniques such as bus invert [3], partial bus invert [4], T0 coding for sequential data [5], code book based encoding [6] and etc. A group of bus encoding techniques such as entropy reduced code [7], beach code [8] and WCM [9], [10] is based on probability of data.

From another point of view we can divide encoding techniques into two categories:   1- Methods do not consider coupling capacitances and  try to minimize the number of transitions like as bus   invert.

2- Methods consider coupling capacitance like WCM.

The first group is not applicable for sub micron technology. The second group also considers cross-talk intrinsically because they tend to avoid transitions in different direction. Number of transitions is not the only factor of power dissipation in buses, because of coupled capacitances between adjacent wires.

WCM is a coding method for buses with random information and known probability distribution. In this method, a memory array in each terminal of a bus codes the data and mapped data is decoded in destination terminal of the bus. The coding style should be such that map the most probable data to code that statistically use the minimum energy as done in [9], [10]. This paper has been proposed a different algorithm for non uniform data distribution. Comparing the results of both algorithms shows that proposed method has better performance for non uniform distributed data.

This paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces WCM method principles and section III discusses about improving its performance. In section IV we deal with simulating and comparing both methods and finally conclusions are presented in section V.



II. PRINCIPLES OF WCM METHOD  Weighted Code Mapping (WCM) is used for buses which transmit random data with known probability distribution for instance input data of some systems or instruction codes or processed data. In some specified application probability distribution of data are known but data sequence are unknown. In the case that statistical view about sequence of data is available it is better to use other methods (for example memory address data that is more likely to be incremental). So when probabilities of data are uncorrelated and have a fixed distribution, WCM is the better choice than others. However hardware limitation should be considered in encoding method selection. WCM method needs a memory as a mapping       table in the coder and decoder parts. We map each original data to a coded data according to this mapping table. This mapping table results in minimum energy dissipation. Since we have probability distribution of data, we map the most probable data to code with minimum power. Now the problem is how coded data sort according to their power dissipation expectations.
