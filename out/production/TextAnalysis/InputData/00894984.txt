1. INTRODUCTION  However, since JPDA is based on Bayesian theory, it is difficult to introduce full sta.tes and other prior knowl- edge which can help solving the associatioii problem inore accurately. Furtlierniore, the number of possi- ble hvpotheses t,hat associate different returns to the targets (under consideration) increase rapidly with t,he iiiiinbrr of ret,urns. Also, the presence of clutters in- crease tlie complexity further. Tlie complexity prob- leni in JPDA/IMM is significant for a number of tar- gets in moderately dense cliitt,er aiitl results in coiiibi- natorial explosion of computations.

To solve some of the difficulties in the .JPDA/IA/lAI.

a fuzzy logic approach for MTT was developed recentlg[-l].

In this inethod, a. fiizzy logic iniiltiple model algorithm is constructed to act as the filter. In this algorithni, the hlarkoviaii switching, wliich is used in IMM, is re- placed by fuzzy rules. Based 011 this algorithm and after constructiiig the corresponding rule set, a fuzzy data  association algorithii is developed, which can use full states, prior knowledge and experience. This irn- plies that in the fuzzy association algorithm, we can not only use the observation states but also use other states which caii not be iiieasured.

In this pa.per, it perforiiiance comparison between the fuzzy algorithm and JPDA/IMM algorithms using siiiiulatioii studies is highlighted. Tlie simulation sce- nario considers tlie two algorithns for tracking two ant1 four targets in a two dimensional setting. Based on the siiiiulation results, the advantages and disadvantages of both the appronclies for A4TT are discussed.

FUZZY MULTIPLE MODEL ALGORITHM  For tracking multiple targets, several models are pos- tulated, and a Kalman filter is set up for each model to estimate their states. Final state estimate is a weighted average of the model-conditioned estimates with fuzzy reasoning.

Consider the state equation and measurement equa.- tion based on j - th model.

Z ( k )  = H X j ( k )  + V , ( k )  ( 2 ) where X j ( k )  = [~j(k)Xj(k)xj(k)]~, is a 3 x 1 state vec- tor. Z ( k )  denotes the measurement sequence through time k; Wj(k)  is the white noise, its covariance is Q j ; V, ( k )  is Gaussian noise, its covariance is R. The initial state is assumed to be Gaussian and uncorrelated with the process and measurement noises.@j and H are the state transform and measurement matrices, and they are assumed to be known. In this paper, H = [ l o  01.

We use three models, they are CV(constant velocity),  1 T @I=(, 1 )  CA( constant acceleration),  and adaptive CA mode1,which use the same state trans- form matrix as CA model, but it can change it's co- variance Q3 at filtering process[5].

Based on the j - th model, the Kalman filter is given as follows:  X j ( k  + l / k )  = cPjX;(k/k)  ( 3 )  r j ( k  + 1)  = Z ( k  + 1)  - H X j ( k  + l / k ) ( r e s i d u a l )  (5)  K j ( k  + 1)  = Pj(k + l/k)HTSJ,j'(k + 1 )  ( 7 )  Pj(k + l / k  + 1 )  = [I  - K j ( k  + l ) H j ] P j ( k  + l / k )  (9) Where X:(k/k), P:(k/k) are the mixed initial con-  dition for model-matched filter j at time k .  X j ( k / k ) , P j ( k / k )  are the state estimates and its covariance in mode-match filter j a t  time k .  X ( k / k ) ,  P ( k / k )  are the combined state estimate and its covariance.

To get the weight of the j - t h  model with fuzzy rea- soning, we define two fuzzy sets. Assuming there are m models,we define the universe U as: U = 1,2 , .  . . , nz.

At first, we define fuzzy sets Ai(i = 1 , 2 , .  . . , nz) as where we think the model j is valid. At step k, the model j ' s  membership function is defined as:  . .

Q, 1=J  m E l ,  otherwise  where a E ( O , l ) , j  = 1 , 2 , .  . . , nz.

Next, we define the fuzzy set B as that set where the model j ( j  = 1 , 2 , . - . , m )  matches the measured track. At step k, the model j ' s  membership function is defined as:  where Ci = cm I=1 p ~ % k ( l ) p ~ ( k - l ) ( l ) .  q ( k )  is residual vec-  tor, which can get from the equation 5. The value of relates to  covariance matrix of measurement noise.

The value of p ~ k ( j )  is adaptive by itself in the tacking process. We can also choose other functions for p ~ k .

To make this clear,the above definition are illus- trated for a case of 2 models,i = 1,2.  if there are 2 models, then  X j ( k  + l / k  + 1 )  = X j ( k  + l / k )  + K j ( k  + l )wj (k  + 1 )  (8)    Now the wliole fuzzy multiple niodel algorithiii is givcii by the following 4 steps.

Step 1 Use the fuzzy reasoniiig tjo get, the mixed initial condit,ion for inodel-inat.cl~c.d filter j froni tlie coiitlitioii o f  last s t q .

rule m: If model 111 is valid,aiid matches the real move- ments mode then P:(X-/k) = P,,,(k/k) + [ . i .7 ,L(k/k)  - 2 , 0 ( k / k ) ] .

[i&,(k/k) - 2 3 k / k ) ] T  By reasoning, we caii get P:(k/k) as  follows:  Rule database 1: For the case of 2 models,  rule 1: If model 1 is valid,and inatclies the real move- iiieiits iiiode then .i.,O(k/k) = &(k/k)  rule 2: If model 2 is valid,and matches the real move- ments inotle tllell . y ( k / k )  = ? l ( k / k )  rule m: If   no del 111 is valid,and mat,ches tlie real iiiove- nierlt,s 111otle then i?(k/k) = Z,,(k/k)  By rexoning, we caii get 2 y ( k / k )  as follows:  For t.lic case of  2 niotlels,  Step 2 Filtering  When we get P:(k/k) and .i.,O(k/k) by using the rule database, we introdnce them to each filter as tlie input,. Then we can start the filter. Based on the j - th mo$el, the filtering can obtain the state es- timation X3 ( k  + l / k  + l ) , the  calculating covariance P,(k + l / k  + 1).

Step 3 using the ,t?j(k + l), the pB(kS1) is calcu- lated with equation 2.

FUZZY ASSOCIATION ALGORITHM  In the multiple target environment, there are many radar returns. Some of them belong to the existed tar- gets, some belong to  the new target, and others belong to the false alarm. So, at first, we must associate the correct radar returns with the correct target tracks, then we can start the data  association. The state and measurement equation are the same as section 11.

At first, we calculate the mixed residual and resid- ual covariance of the i measurements for target t using the following equation.

m  P t ( k / k -  1) = m  PL"B(k+,,(j){Pj"(~/k: - I )+  [ X j ( k / k  - 1) - X t ( k / k  - l)].

[X' j t (k /k  - 1) - X t ( k / k  - 1)]T}  j=1  vi ( k )  = zi ( k )  - HXt ( k / k  - 1) (21) S t ( k )  = H P t ( k / k  - l ) H T  + R (22)  we will define the statist,ical distance p i  between the i t h  measurement and the target t :  p: ( k )  = ?I; (k)%t-l (k)V,t ( k ) )  (23)  Then we define the fuzzy sets,At, B,  C, D: At(t = 1,2 , .  . . , T )  : The current measurement Zi(k) is valid for target t .  It's membership function is:  where 7t = a 2 7 r m Bj is defined as that case when the statistical distance p i  matches the real distance between the target t and the measurement Zi.. Its membership function is:  fBt(zZ(k)) = ex&p:(k)/2) (25 )  Cj is defined as that case when the statistical velocity matches the real velocity between the target t and the measurement Zi. Its membership function is:  fc,(Zi(k)) = ezp(-IZi(k) - Xt(k,,- l / k  - 1)- X"k - l / k  - 1) - X"k - l / k  - 1)l)  For D, based on following 5 cases, five fuzzy sets D1, D2, D3, D4, D5 are defined:  Case D1 if Zi(k)is valid for only one target  Case D2 if Z i ( k )  is valid for in targets,and for these m targets, there is only one measurement like the &(IC), and each of these m targets has one or more other measurements  Case D3 if & ( I C )  is valid for m targets, and for these m targets, there is only one target like the Zi(k) , n targets of these have only this measurements  Case D4 in Case C, for the other targets  Case D5 if there are 1 valid Z i ( k )  for m targets  For fuzzy sets D l , D 2 , D 3 , 0 4 , D 5 ,  their membership function is defined as follows:  1, Case D1 Case D2  fD(ZZ(k)) = 4% Case D3  Case D5  l /m:  [ ; y m - l ) ,  C s e D 4 Where a, b is in [0, 11, and a is larger than b.

Now we give the algorithm as follows:     1. Using tlie above estimator, we get the. prrtlictetl state, it(k/k - 1) = N P ( k / k  - 1)  2. Calciilate tlie statistic distance to  every target, for all t11e nleJaSllrelllellt  3. Ca.lculate the residual vector of & ( k )  for target, t by it's inembership in every fuzzy set:  4. For target t ( t  = 1> 2 , .  , T ) ,  calculate the residual vector V , ( k ) ,  (T is the number of all target):  where ' rnk  is the number of observat,ion.

5. For txget, t ,  if no observation is valid for i t ,  we define /jA(k) = 1, else & ( k )  = 0, then modify the update equation as follows:  P ( k / k )  = P ( k / k  - I) + P ( k ) v y k ) P ( k / k )  P ' ( k / k )  = / $ ) ( k ) P t ( k / k  - 1) + f" (k)+ (1 - &( k ) ) P  ( k )S '  (k)[K'  ( k ) ] T  7121-  P" ( k ) k l m A.

UT-  [Kt  @)]* i = l  4. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION STUD- IES  In this section, a pcrforiiiance evaluation of the pro- posed fuzzy dgoritliiii and tlie JPDA/IMM algorithms is presented using simulation studies. Three cliffererit tracking sceiia.rios are considered for t,liis evaluation.

In tlie first scenazio, two targets with tlie trajectories a s  in Fig.:! are studied. In scenario 2 for the same two t,iirgt>ts tlic tra,ject.ories are niatle close as in Fig.3 a.iit1 tlic pc~foriii;r.nce cwilu;i.t.ctf. In the tliirtl and last. s m - nario 4 t,argct,s with tlicir trnject,ories as in Fig.4 are iiscd for waliiakioii.

In the .IPDA/IMM a.lgorit1iin aiid also iii the fuzzy iiiult,iplc niotltd dgor i th i s ,  tlirce estha.t,ors using Kaliiiaii filtcrs bascd 011 t h e e  different, models as givtm bclow are iistttl. Tlie niodels are based on coiistaiit velocity  (CV) ,constant, acceleration (CA), and adaptlive ~cce l - tmition models. In all cases only the position inea.sure- iurnt is considerecl and tlie measurenlent iiiatrix H is of t,he form: H = [I 0 01. Also t,ht. perforinance is evalu- ated for bath low (01 = 0.5*0.001.42 = 0.2*0.001)and heavy clutter density enviroii1nent.s (c,, = 5 * 0.001).

Scenario 1: Figure 2 sliows the designed (crossing) targets tra-  jectory with the angle between t,lieni being 12 degree.

Measurement noise covariance R ( k )  is taken as 100ni.

Both the two targets have a constant acceleration.

'",  Figure 2: A Designed two Targets Trajectory  Table 1 displays the computation time (tJ, Mean Error (RIIE) of position, velocity and acceleration, and also the Root Mean Square Error s(RMSE. In the IOW noise case, the computatioiial time of the fuzzy ap- proach( with no prior knowledge) has 5% improvement over the JPDA/IMM. Also, it's accuracy is slightly better. When the noise becomes heavy, the fuzzy ap- proacli( with no prior knowledge) has a small improve- ment. Sine there are more false measurements now, the performance improves when one uses prior knowledge.

In the case with prior knowledge the fuzzy algorithm is 20% faster than JPDA/IhdM with a 10% improvement in accuracy. So, for this scenario, the fuzzy approach is obviously better tliaii JPDA/IMM.

Scenario 2: For this scenario, the designed trajectories for the  two closing targets are shown in Figure 3.  Table 2 present the perforniance coin parisoii between fuzzy and JPDA algorithnis. Based on tlie results in t,lie table, it can be seen that for the low noise case, tlie fuzzy a.pproach(wit1i no prior knowletlg~) Iias about 13% iin- proveinent in the computation t,iiiic . Thc accuracy of the f i m y  also is bctter t,han .JPDA/IMM by about 7%.

Wlien tlie noise becoiiies heavv, t,he fiizzy approach (no prior knowledge) shows a better performance. It is faster than JPDA/IMR/I by 4%, :ut1 more accurate tliaii JPDA/IMM by 11%. Meanwhile, if we use prior knowledge, it is faster than JPDA/IMM by 11% and    more accurate by 13%. Hence in this case also the fuzzy approach gives a better performance especially with prior knowledge. This implies that when there are more clutter, if we can have a good prior knowledge to delete some false measurement, we call get a better performance than JPDA/IMM with a short computa- tion time.

T i W 4  Figure 3: The two closing targets trajectory  Scenario 3:  For the case of four targets with trajectories as in Fig. 4, the tables 3 show the computation time and measurement errors. For this case, from Table 3, it can be seen that the fuzzy approach(n0 prior knowledge) has 22% improvement in computation time with sini- ilar accuracy of JPDA/IMM. But for this case, when we use prior knowledge, the performance of fuzzy ap- proach is worse than that without prior knowledge, though it is still better than JPDA/IMM. The rea- son for this is tha.t in this case, it?s difficult to get a good knowledge about the target movement and hence it costs more in computation time to  judge the false measurement. But this can not delete more false mea- surements efficiently.

5. CONCLUSION  In this paper, a new data association method based on fuzzy logic for multi target tracking is presented briefly. Then we study the performance of the pro- posed fuzzy algorithm under different tracking scenar- ios and compare its performance with the well known JPDA/IMM algorithm. Based on the results it can be seen that since the proposed method uses fuzzy rules.

One gets a better performance and also with a reduc- tion in computation time, if the prior information is correct. From the simulation studies, it is evident that using fuzzy logic in the problem of multitarget track- ing is good, because it is faster than JPDA/IMM, with similar accuracies of JPDA/IMM.
