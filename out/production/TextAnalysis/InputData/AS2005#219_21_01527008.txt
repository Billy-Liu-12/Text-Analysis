Abstract: In this paper we present a new multitarget tracking algorithm for use in centralized multisensor tracking situation.

At first, the algorithm permutes and combines the measurement from each sensor using the rule of generalized S-D assignment algorithm. Then, all of measurements in each assignment are combined into one equivalent measurement according to their weight in the assignment. Finally, the joint association probability of each equivalent measurement is calculated, and then the state estimation in fusion center is obtained. In this paper, some typical simulations are used to compare the performance of the algorithm with the other centralized multisensor joint probabilistic data association (MSJPDA) method, and the results show that the performance of the algorithm here is much better.

Keywords: Centralized; multisensor; joint probabilistic; data association 1. Introduction With the development of science and technique, the battle field getting more and more complex. The surveillance systems used in battle have been developed into multisensor system. Therefore, the multisenor multitarget tracking algorithm get much more important.

Such as centralized multisensor joint probabilistic data association (MSJPDA) algorithm [1,2] ,distributed multisensor joint probabilistic data association algorithm [3]distributed multisensor multi-hypothesis track (MSMHT) algorithm [4] ,and generalized S-Dimensional (S-D) assignment algorithm [1,2,5~9] and so on.

Joint probabilistic data association (JPDA) algorithm [1,2,11~14] is a typical multitarget tracking algorithm. L.Y?Pao extended the JPDA algorithm for use in multisensor tracking situation, the parallel and sequential implementations of multisenor joint probabilistic data association algorithm were been presented. However, we find that the parallel implementations of MSJPDA algorithm often emanative in simulations[15] ,and the tracking perform ance of sequential MSJPDA algorithm get worse when the sensor has a low detectability. To resolve these problems, a new centralized multisensor joint probabilistic data association algorithm is presented. In this new algorithm, the measurement from each sensor is permuted and combined by using the rule of generalized S-D assignment algorithm at first. And then, all of measurements in each assignment are combined into one equivalent measurement according to their weight in the assignment, which decided by their likelihood value.

Finally, technique of JPDA is used to get the joint likelihood value for each equivalent measurement and the joint association probability is calculated according to the value, then the state estimation in fusion center is obtained.

This new algorithm is called centralized joint probabilistic data association based on S-Dimensional assignment (SD-CMSJPDA).The Monte Carlo simulation is used to  analyze the performance of the new algorithm. Simulation results show that the performance of the algorithm here is much better than that of the other MSJPDA algorithms existed.

Multisensor data association In the generalized S-Dimensional(S-D) assignment algorithm, measurement from each sensor is compart- mentalized into some feasible event with a rule. The rule is?(1) Each measurement from every sensors has a source (target or clutter)? (2) Each measurement from every sensors belongs to only one source. Using this rule?the measurement from each sensor can be permuted and combined. Then a equivalent measurement is gained in each combination according to their weight. And the multisensor joint association probability of each equivalent measureme nt is calculated according to its joint likelihood value. Let  denote the lth measurement from the th sensor at time k.  is a combination of measurement from each sensor. Then, the multisensor joint association probability of these equivalent measurements is calculated as follows: )(ks sn n lZ sn ),...,,,( s sN N llll ZZZZZL = The key to the SD-CMSJPDA algorithm is the evaluation of the conditional probabilities of the following  joint association events pertaining to the current time k: ?kM L Ltk )( = = ??            ?3?

4. Simulations One has run simulations comparing the sequential implementations of MSJPDA algorithm and the new algorithm here. A typical multisensor multitarget tracking environment is assumed in the simulations. According to article [1,3], One known that the performance of sequential MSJPDA is better than the performance of parallel MSJPDA. Therefore, the performance of parallel MSJPDA algorithm will not be compared here.

Simulations have been run for racking two targets. The true initialization state of the targets is?

X ?[-26250m,296m/s,34500m,-400m/s]'? 2 The two targets will cross above 31seconds later. To evaluate tracking performance, 50 Monte Carlo runs were performed for three case of the target detection probability: Pd=0.97 ? Pd=0.76 ? Pd=0.58. In every run, the total simulation time is 140 steps.

simulation time is 140 steps.

Figure 1  RMS position error in case of Pd=0.97          Figure 2  RMS velocity error in case of Pd=0.97       Figure 3  RMS position error in case of Pd=0.76 Guangzhou, 18-21 August 2005         Figure 4  RMS velocity error in case of Pd=0.76         Figure 5  RMS position error in case of Pd=0.58          Figure 6  RMS velocity error in case of Pd=0.58  Table 1 The emanative times comparison for sequential MSJPDA and SD-CMSJPDA algorithm  Pd N A  0.97 0. 76 0.58 Sequential MSJPDA 2 11 17 SD-CMSJPDA 0 3 5 ?Pd denotes detection probability, N denotes emanative    ?Pd denotes detection probability, N denotes emanative times, A denotes the kind of algorithm?

Table 1 shows the summation of emanative times for sequential MSJPDA and SD-CMSJPDA algorithm in 50 Monte Carlo simulations. From table 1 , it is shown that the stability of SD-CMSJPDA is better than that of sequential MSJPDA as the detection probability varied.

Figure 1,2 show the RMS errors for position and velocity in case of Pd=0. 97, respectively; Figure 3,4 show the RMS errors for position and velocity in case of Pd=0.76, respectively; Figure 3,4 show the RMS errors for position and velocity in case of Pd=0.58, respectively. From the figures we can see that the average RMS position error is lower for the SD-CMS JPDA algorithm. We also see that the state estimation precision of sequential MSJPDA get worse as the detection probability decreases.

The reasons for these simulation results lies:1) The state estimation precision will get worse when the detection probability decrease;2) The way of sequenti al MSJPDA algorithm is to process measurement from each sensor using single sensor JPDA algorithm sequentially. Therefore, the estimation error from each sensor will be accumulated.

Moreover, the sequential MSJPDA algorithm can?t improve the joint detection probability of the multisensor system.

The estimation error of the SD- CMSJPDA  algorithm will not be accumulated for it processes the measurement from each sensor directly in the mean time .What?s more, the new method can greatly improve the joint detection probability of the multisensor system. Therefore, the tracking performance of SD-CMSJPDA algorithm is better than that of sequential MSJPDA. Algorithm.

All of the simulations are run in the personal computer with a 2.0G CPU and a 256M memory. The average cost time per step is 0.0251 in the sequential implementations of MSJPDA algorithm. And the average cost time per step is 0.0282 in the sequential implementations of MSJPDA algorithm. According to the results we can see that there is few difference in real time between the new method and the sequential   MSJPDA when there is not so many sensors and targets.

Guangzhou, 18-21 August 2005  5. Conclusion In order to solve the problem of multisensor multi target tracking, a new centralized multisensor  joint probabilistic data association  algorithm is proposed in this paper. The simulation results shows that the tracking performance of the new algorithm is better than that of the sequential MSJPDA algorithm.

The computational complexity of the new method will increase as the number of sensors and targets grow.

Therefore, how to improve the real time of SD- CMSJPDA algorithm will be pay attention.
