Application of Data Mining in Fault Diagnosis Based on Ontology  ?

Abstract  In this paper, a new kind of automated fault diagnosis algorithm is proposed. It is a new data-mining  algorithm with ontology-based. This algorithm doesn?t  only find low-level rules which usually not interesting ,  but also can find high-level rules which described by high-level concepts. In this paper, we use ontologies  provide a mechanism, in data mining, by which domain  specific knowledge may be included to aid the discovery  process and can find multi- level classification rules, the rules are described by high-level concepts. So it can  provide more interesting rules for enterprise. Finally, a  study case is given to explain the practical application  with the fault diagnosis bases on ontology, and is given encouraging results.

1. Introduction  Discover Information and rules of product fault  diagnosis from databases quickly and correctly has been  the focus in enterprise. The emphasis has been how to  obtain the correct and easy understanding decision based  on fault classification.

Recently, many researchers have been developing lots  of algorithms to analyze databases and discover  interesting information in it, such as Association Rules  K-means K-medoids and some heuristic algorithms. But  these search in databases at low levels. That is, the  language of the interesting information returned is  composed of only the terms occurring in the data itself.

And when they discover in large databases, the rules that  they found will be huge and hard to understanding. If we  want to obtain interesting and easy understanding rules,  we must use background knowledge or domain  knowledge to reduce uninteresting rules and generalize  some rules to make rules become fewer and clearer. How  to do it automated?

The designers of [1] have investigated an attribute-  oriented approach for knowledge discovery in databases.

The approach applies an attribute-oriented concept tree  ascension technique in generalization, which integrates  the machine learning methodology with set-oriented  database operations, and extracts generalized data from  actual data in databases. The designers of [2] have  developing a classification algorithm that will find  classification rules at multiple levels of abstraction.

In this paper, we present an ontology-based data-  mining algorithm and applied it into fault diagnosis  problem, which can make interesting and easy  understanding rules.

2. Fault diagnosis based on ontology  Ontologies can provide a mechanism, by which  domain specific knowledge could be included to aid the  discovery process in data mining. So that we can generate  high-level rules automated.

2.1. Ontologies  Ontology is a specification of a conceptualization. The  word "ontology" seems to generate a lot of controversy in  discussions about AI. It has a long history in philosophy,  in which it refers to the subject of existence. It is also  often confused with epistemology, which is about  knowledge and knowing. In the context of knowledge  sharing, ontology is a description (like a formal  specification of a program) of the concepts and  relationships that can exist for an agent or a community  of agents. This definition is consistent with the usage of  ontology as set-of-concept-definitions, but more general.

Ontologies become the core of many researches, such  as knowledge acquired processing management  Database Integration Framework. And some ontologies  have been built. For example, Cvc[3] Ontolingua[4]  TOVE Edinburgh Plan and so on.

2.2. Approach  The algorithm we described is based on ontology,  which is use domain knowledge to guide the discovery  process such that we can discover interesting and high  level rules. The designers of DBLearn [1] and KBRL [5]  have explored data mining at high level of abstraction. In  this paper we present a technique similar to those and  applied in fault diagnosis. The approach discovers low  level rules with data mining and then obtains high-level  abstraction using domain ontologies.

We discover rules at high levels of abstraction have  several advantages over data mining at low levels. First, it  makes rules clearer. In general, data mining systems  generate rules of databases in the form of low-level.

High-level rules can thus be considered to generate by the  rules existing at lower levels. They are especially  beneficial if it possible to reduce many low level rules  that are similar in general content and form. Second, it  makes rules fewer. The high level rules are the abstract of  the low levels, so they are fewer. The benefit of it is they  are generalized the content of the low level concepts, it  become more interesting.

We apply this approach to an electric database. Built  the model of data based on ontology and discover fault  fault reason and then obtain high- level diagnosis rules.

2.3. Ontology model  Ontologies play an important role in the multi-level  classification process. Because they contain the concept  that the approach will used to induce its rules. For built  ontology model, we find all the concepts first. In this  paper the domain is product quality management. It is  face to product line?s activities. Every activity is  composed of an active entity and other factors. In  enterprise, process of produce includes many procedures;  every procedure includes many quality control points  (QCP); every QCP is related to some quality reference  record (QRR). So the QRR QCP and procedure are all  activity entities in different levels and every of them has  five important factors, that is MAN MACHINE  MATERTIAL METHOD and ENVIRONMENT. Every  activity entity can be defined as an array with seven  elements, (ID, M1, M2, M3, M4, E, R). ID is the uniquely  attribute of an activity entity; M1 can be the attribute  about factor of man; M2 can be the attribute about factor  of machine; M3 can be the attribute about factor of material; M4 can be the attribute about factor of method;  E can be the attribute about factor of environment; R can  be describe the relationship between entities.

From above, we built a procedure ontology model as  figure 1, it present a concept framework with four layers.

From the root, every level node represents a specific  concept, they are procedure sub-procedures QCP and  QRR respectively.

Most of the records in database are the information of  leave nodes, which 0presents QRR, and less of the other  nodes. So if we do data mining in database directly, only  can obtain low level rules from leave nodes. On the other  hand, the information in database does not have the same  level so that it?s hard to discover the efficient rules. In  this paper we provide an approach based on high-level  abstraction using domain ontologies. We use ontologies  to pre-generalize the concepts in rules after applying the  core data-mining algorithm. And then we use data mining  algorithm again to discover the high level in the abstract  rules. Then we could obtain more interesting rules. They  are clearer and fewer.

2.4. Algorithm  Define 1 Ideal_Depth Ideal_Depth, Id, is the  preferred level of generality. So the root node level is  zero, Id 0.

Define 2 Diff_Depth Diff_Depth, Dd ,is the  respective concept, Dd x,y Id x  Id y . That  is say, if node x and node y in the same level then Dd x,y 0; if node x is the parent of node y then Dd x,y <=1.

Define 3 Abstract concept It is the process of  translating low level concepts into high level concepts.

Define 4 Merge concepts: It is the process of merging  similar concepts which in the same rules and have the  same abstract concept into a single high-level concept.

The complete algorithm is:  1) Date mining low-level rules: Use the algorithm of  association rules to discover rules, which are low-  level rules, in the database. Record the rules and the  frequency of them.

2) Generalize concepts: In all rules, we generalize the  concepts with the special Id. That is, at the beginning  we initialized the value of Id which presents the  concept?s depth we want. And then abstracts all  concepts until their reach the Id level. This process is  Sub-proc  QCP  Procedure  Sub-proc  QCP  Sub-proc  QCP  Figure1.  Procedure ontology model      based on ontology model, which is we translate node  into its parent node.

3) Merge concepts: After we generalize the concepts,  maybe some concepts are replaced by a single  concept in one rule. In this case, we merge the same  concepts which in one rule and double the frequency.

4) Data mining high-level rules: After above dealing  with, we can data mining the new rules again, and  find the high-level rules. The high level rules have  the same coverage as the low level alternatives. And  they are clearer and fewer.

2.5. Experiment  We apply the above algorithm on the electric database.

This database contains 100,000 quality records including  3,629 fault records. In this enterprise, it has about five  procedures. Now we want to research the database, and  then obtain some rules to help enterprise make some  decision. For this purpose, the better rules are invited to  easy understand. That is, from the rules, enterprise could  know how to improve the products? quality. So we use  two algorithms, the general data-mining algorithm and  our algorithm which based on ontology, to see which  algorithm can answer the question better.

1) Discover rules in database directly with general data  mining. The result is in the left of table 1. We  classified the data about 26 kinds using the record of  QRR the phenomena of scene and the repair judge.

And then find some rules, we sort them according  the frequency counts ascend and list five of them in  the table. From the rule, we only know which fault  often happen or some faults happen together in  which procedure.

2) Discover rules in database with the algorithm based  on ontology and now we define the Id level is the  procedure?s level. We classified the data about 5  kinds. And then find some rules, we also sort them  according the frequency counts ascend and list four  of them in the right of table 1. From the rule, we  know what the greatest reason Influence product is.

Two algorithms are all discover some rules, but it  doesn?t in the same level. First algorithm only finds  which fault occurs usually and some faults often occur  together in which procedure. That is the association  between faults and procedures. If we want to make some  decision, we must analyze the fault rules to find the  reason why the fault occurred, and then maybe can put  forward some resolvents. Second algorithm finds what  the greatest factor influence product is and we can make a  decision quickly. For example, if we see the rule as  (Outsourcing procedure), we will know that the material  quality from outsourcing is the greatest influence to the  product?s quality. So we can make a decision  immediately, that is Take measures to strengthen  management for outsourcing and strictly control the gate  of the quality.

3. Conclusion  The general data-mining algorithm only discovers  rules in database directly and finds the low-level rules.

These rules must use domain knowledge or background  knowledge to guide the discovery process to make the  rules be interesting. In this paper we present an algorithm  based on ontology. It can discover high-level rules and  they are clearer fewer than low-level rules. By  compared general data mining with our algorithm which  is based on ontology, we have a conclusion that the rules  discovered by our algorithm is more interesting than the  general algorithm and the rules is benefit to enterprise?s  decision. Applying it into fault diagnosis in a electric  database, we can discover multi-level rules and make  rules clearer fewer and more interesting.
