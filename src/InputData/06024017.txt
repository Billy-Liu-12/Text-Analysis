I. INTRODUCTION  Mining Association Rules is one of the data mining technologies. It can find potential relationship and related relationship from the large numbers of data. Rakesh Agrawal first announce the mining association rules in the document [l]in 1993.The traditional Mining Association Rules mainly use in relationship which mine collection of various items in the client transactions. For instance, high frequency A=>B, high related rules, we call it positive association rules. In fact, database used the implicit expression modes which these mining can't find. It has low frequency, high relationship qualities. It has high related qualities which data projects can't find directly. One of the implicit expression mode is negative association rules, such as AUnB> nAUB> nAUnB. It has important effects which can find negative association rules. In shopping analysis, the client buy the product X and Y together, X ' and Y ' which the client seldom buy. It is very important for decision-makers to select the positions of the products.

With the fast development of the science technology, positive association rules and the research of the algorithm has improved a lot. The classic algorithm is Apriori algorithm,It mainly include two steps.

l)We call it frequent collection which exists in the transactions which the whole support greater than the least support. It is the core of the algorithm which can decide the mining association rules.

2)It can make the Association Rules with the frequency which use the step 1 to find.

At present, the negative association mining algorithm is not so much. For instance, the document [9] announce the negative association rules mining algorithm which is based on the .kronrod. The document [10] announce the mining  for Mining Positive and Negative Rules  Yanyan Wu Information Engineering College  Ninbo Dahongying University Ningbo China  e-mail: wyy0980@sina.com  algorithm positive and negative association rules which is based on the interest level. The document [11] announce the mining algorithm positive and negative association rules which is based on the support, confidence level, correlation coefficient. The document [12] announce the positive and negative association rules which is based on the sequence mode.The main reason is the difficulty of the research of the is the search space of the negative association rules is larger than the search space of the positive and negative association rules. The development of the search space is in index. Data mining faces a lot of data, but the associated rules find the existing rules in the every item set. If the store has more than 1000 products, the number of the frequent item sets in transaction database D is about 250.The number of the non frequent item sets in D is up to 21000-250, nearly 21000.It is untrue to count the support non frequent item sets.

The paper gives the algorithm of negative association rules to achieve the negative association rules in transaction database D.



II. POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE ASSOCIATION RULES DESCRITION  Definition 1 the collection I={i1,i2,...,im},the element is called item. The D is marked as the collection of the transaction T. The transaction T is the collection of the item, T ^ I. It is related to the only ID(tid). A is the collection of the items of I, if A ^ T, then transaction T include A.

The related rules such as A=>B, A ^ I , B C I , and ATI B = 0 .A is the body of the rules. B is the head of the rules.

The support of the rules A=>B in the transaction database D is ratio of the sum A and sum B. It is marked as support(A=>B), or support(AUB),  Support(A=>B)= support(AUB)= | {T: AUB^T, T<ED} 1 / l D l  The confidence of the rules A=>B in the transaction database D is ratio of the sum A and sum B. It is marked as confidence(A=>B), Confidence(A=>B)= | {T: AUB^T, T E D } | / | { T : A ^ T , T E D } |  The transaction collection D, mining association rules is the rules of the support greater than the minsupp and the confidence greater than the minconf.

Definition 2 To the collection A> B, AflB=0, there are 8 association rules between A and B.

1)A=>B 2)A=>nB 3) nA=>B 4)1A=>1B 5)B=>A 6)B=>nA 7) nB=>A 8) nB=>nA 1) is the positive association rules.2)~4) is negative  association rules. It present the negative connection.5) ~8) and 1) ~4) is related. The character A exchange B in 1) ~4).

It is not discussed in this paper.

An effective negative associated rules should satisfy three conditions:  l)AflB=& 2) supp(A) ^minsupp M supp(B) ^minsupp 3)supp(AU B) ^minsupp Or suppC AUB) ^minsupp Or suppCAWB) ^minsupp The negative associated rules include the non  collection^1 A , n B ) .It is difficult to count the support level and confidence level directly. It use the support level and confidence level in the collection A and B to count.

The document [13] get the related conclusion.

Theorem 1 If A, B C I , Af lB=0, then 1) supp C A) = 1 -supp(A); 2)supp(A W B) =supp(A)-supp(A LB) 3) suppCAUB)=supp(B)-supp(AUB) 4) suppC AW B)=l-supp(A)-supp( B)+supp(AUB) Corollary 1 If A, B C I , ATIB=0, then  sup p(A) - sup p(A U B) _ 1) conf(A=> n B)=  conf(A=>B) sup p(A)  2)conf(nA=>B)= sup p(B) - sup p(A U B)  1 - sup p(A) 3)conf(nA=>nB)=  1 - sup p(A) - sup p(B) + sup p(A U B) _ l-conf(nA=>B) 1 - sup p(A)  If you want to think about the mining problems of the negative associated rules, you should the solve conflicting problems of the rules. Such as A is the client want to buy grape. B is the client want to buy the banana. If the rulesconf(A=>B) > minconf and conf(A=>"1 B) > minconf, then it is a contradiction. Buy grape=>Buy banana and buy grape.and no buy grape=> no buy banana.

To the positive and negative associated rules, you can avoid the relativity of the associated rules. In the document [14],it define the relativity of the associated rules. The relativity of the collection A and B can be presented by formula:  supp(AUB) CorrA,B=  sup p(A) sup p(B) (count)  It can judge the A > B relativity situation through CorrA,B.

If CorrA,B>l, then A and B is positive related.

If CorrA,B=l, then A and B is independent.

If CorrA,B<l, then A and B is negative related.

The relativity of the collection A and B has this  relationship. If CorrA,B>l,then CorrA, n B<1 ; Corr n  A,B<1; Corr-1 A,-1 B>1,else it is opposite. When you mine positive and negative association rules, you should use the relativity of the collection to judge and avoid the conflict of the rules. If CorrA,B>1,then you just mine A=>B andn A=> n B. If CorrA,B<1,then you just mine n A=>B fl A=>n B. If CorrA,B=l, you can't mine the rules.
