Using Rough Set to support Investment Strategies of Rule-based trading with  Real-Time Data in Futures Market

Abstract Investment strategies in stock market have gained  unprecedented popularity in major financial markets around the world. However, it is a very difficult problem because of the fluctuation of the stock market.

This study presents usefulness of rough set on the rule base to develop real-time investment strategies using technical analysis in futures market. This study consists of four phases. In the first phase, meaningful technical indicators are selected to reflect market movements. In the second phase, rough set is used to extract trading rules for identification of buy and sell patterns in the stock market. In the third phase, the investment strategies are developed in order to apply selected trading rules using rule-based reasoning to unpredictable stock market. Finally, investment strategies on the basis of rule base are evaluated by real-time trading. This study then examines the profitability of the proposed model.

1. Introduction   Determining investment strategies in the stock market is quite difficult since many factors, including political events, general economic conditions, and investors? expectations, influence the stock market.

The stock market is essentially a non-linear, non- parameter system, and it is extremely hard to model with any reasonable accuracy. Although there have been numerous attempts in the past to predict the next trend, the best performers have traditionally been the ones who posses considerable knowledge of the markets. However, they are only human and are very limited in their capacity to assimilate information and  spot subtle trends in the information, which may be the indicators of an imminent change in the value of market stock. For this reason, several researchers in finance and investment have begun to use information system fields, including expert systems and artificial intelligence technologies for predicting the stock market. Others have also predicted price movements in the stock market by using artificial neural networks [11, 2, 29]. For example, Lee and Jo (1990) [19] developed an expert system for predicting the best stock market timing, when to buy and sell, using a candlestick chart.

They reported that the average hit ratio of applied rules was 72%.

As the Korean futures market has become larger and more mercurial, traders and investors in the market have come to need powerful supporters in their investment decision since human capability in analyzing all the data could not satisfy most expectations. This study proposes the real-time investment strategies by trading rules generated through rough set based on the rule base using technical analysis in futures market. It also presents a procedure for constructing efficient real-time investment strategies which uses technical analysis and rough set analysis in futures market. Meaningful technical indicators are selected to reflect market movements through the technical analysis. Then, rough set is used to extract trading rules based on selected technical indicators for identification of buy and sell patterns in the market. Two analyses, also known as ensemble based systems in data mining [25], were used as a classifier for decision making, which is better than a single classifier. One of the earliest studies on ensemble system is Dasarathy and Sheela?s 1979 work      10], which discusses partitioning the feature space, using two or more classifiers.

Moreover, this study uses real-time data. Real-time data denotes information that is delivered immediately after collection, and thus is provided instantly. On the other hand, delayed or historical data is delivered after some time, usually from about 10 to 30 minutes, making the information not up-to-date. Also, historical data is usually adjusted after being combined with real- time data, so the figures are somewhat inaccurate.

Croushore and Stark (2003) [9] researched into a real- time data set for macroeconomists and Gerberding et al. (2005) [16] studied a real-time data set for German macroeconomic variables.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

Section 2 reviews the concept of futures market and technical analysis, and the rough set theory. Section 3 describes the rule generation procedure using technical analysis and rough set analysis. In Section 4, the research data and experiments are described, and the empirical results are summarized and discussed.

Finally, the concluding remarks are presented in Section 5.

2. Background  2.1. Futures market and technical analysis   Futures market is an opportunity where one takes a  marginal profit that buys when the bull market is forecasted and sells when the bear market is forecasted.

Therefore, it is a market which offers the possibility of making profit in both bull market and bear market.

Namely, it is a trading market that predicted the directivity of price fluctuations.

Stocks are influenced by the intrinsic value evaluation, technical analysis theory of the enterprise, and the current price fluctuation. However, since futures are transactions of goods which are extracted from the abstraction of price, the current price fluctuation prediction is possible in only technical analysis without the complicated enterprise of intrinsic value evaluation. Technical analysis studies the historical data relevant to price and volume movements of the stock by using charts as a primary tool to forecast possible price movements [22]. It is considered by many to be the original form of investment analysis, as it has been used since the 1800s. According to early research, future and past stock prices were deemed as irrelevant. As a result, it was believed that using past data to predict the future stock price was impossible, and that it would only have abnormal profits. However, recent findings have proven that there was, indeed, a relationship between  the past and future return rates. Furthermore, arguments have been made that by using past return rates, future return rates could also be forecasted.
