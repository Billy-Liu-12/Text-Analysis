Abstract?One of the main tasks of KDTCM (knowledge dis- covery in Traditional Chinese Medicine) is discovering paired or grouped drugs in Chinese Medical Formula database. Paired or grouped drugs are special combinations of two or more kinds of drugs. They not only have strong efficacy, but also can be used to construct formula classification rules. Associated and correlated pattern mining is effective in a certain extent because of the large number of correlation and association relationships among various kinds of drugs. However, both independent associated patterns and mutually positively correlated simultaneous associ- ated patterns have the downward closure property. They might be more special and have probability greater than associated and correlated patterns to be paired or grouped drugs. Therefore, in this paper, we develop an algorithm for generating all such kinds of patterns synchronously. Experimental results show that the proposed techniques in the paper are effective and feasible.



I. INTRODUCTION  Confronted with the increasing popularity of TCM (Tra- ditional Chinese Medicine) and the huge volume of TCM databases, such as CMF (Chinese Medical Formula) database and TCM clinical database, there is an urgent need to explore these resources effectively by the techniques of knowledge discovery in database (KDD) [1]. Paired or grouped drugs are special combinations of two or more kinds of drugs. They not only have strong efficacy, but also can be used to construct important formula classification rules. For this reason, discov- ering paired or grouped drugs from CMF database becomes one of the hot topics in TCM data mining researches.

In CMF database, there are many association and correlation relationships among various kinds of drugs [2]. Thus, both associated pattern and correlated pattern mining is usually adopted in order to learn these relationships effectively. N- evertheless, long correlated patterns have no much statistical significance owing to the upward closure property of correla- tion. Both independent associated patterns and mutually pos- itively correlated simultaneous associated patterns satisfy the downward closure property, so they might be more special and have probability higher than associated patterns and correlated patterns to be paired or grouped drugs even if all of them have the same support. Consequently, in this paper, for the purpose of getting more paired or grouped drugs, we explore associa- tion and correlation relationships at the same time and develop an algorithm for mining independent associated patterns and mutually positively correlated simultaneous associated patterns synchronously. This is the motivation behind our data mining researches.

A difficult problem in this paper is that there are few measures which not only have property bounds for effectively  evaluating the correlation degree of patterns produced, but also are suitable for mining long correlated patterns. One of the most commonly employed methods for correlation mining is that of two-dimensional contingency table analy- sis of categorical data using the chi-square statistic as the measure of correlation significance. S.Brin et al. [3] analyze contingency tables to generate correlation rules that identify statistical correlation in both the presence and absence of items in itemsets. H. Liu et al. [4] analyze contingency tables to discover unexpected and interesting patterns that have a low lever of support and a high level of correlation relationships.

B. Liu et al. [5] use contingency tables for pruning and summarizing the discovered rules etc. Although the low chi- squared value (less than the cutoff value, e.g. 3.84 at the 95% correlation significance lever [6]) effectively indicates that all patterns XY,XY C , XCY,XCY C are independent, that is, X and Y , X and Y C , XC and Y , XC and Y C are all independent. The chi-squared value that is greater than 3.84 cannot indicate that all patterns XY,XY C , XCY,XCY C are correlated, so it is possible that X and Y are independent in spite of the high chi-squared value. On the other hand, the chi-square statistic as the measure of correlation significance is not suitable for mining long correlated patterns [7].

Measure P (XY )?P (X)P (Y )/  ? P (X)P (Y )(1? P (X))(1? P (Y ))  [8] is not suitable for generating long correlated patterns either.

P (XY )/P (X)P (Y ) [3] does not have proper bounds. In this paper, we use the correlation-confidence as the measure of correlation significance [2]. It is a measure much like P (XY )?P (X)P (Y ) [9], but it is more reasonable and easier to be controlled during the process when we compare P (XY ) with P (X)P (Y ), because the correlation-confidence has both upper and lower bounds 1 and ?1.

In order to synchronously generate all independent associ- ated patterns and mutually positively correlated simultaneous associated patterns, an efficient algorithm is developed. Exper- iments are performed not only on CMF database obtained from CATCM (China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine), but also on mushroom database. Experimental results show that the measure correlation-confidence is more rational and easier to be controlled for synchronously mining all inde- pendent associated patterns and mutually positively correlated simultaneous associated patterns, especially for finding long such kinds of patterns. Experimental results also show that the algorithm developed in the paper is correct and effective.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In section II, we give some related definitions, and then develop     an algorithm for synchronously mining all independent associ- ated patterns and mutually positively correlated simultaneous associated patterns. In section III, we show our experimental results. We conclude our study in section IV.



II. MINING INDEPENDENT ASSOCIATED PATTERNS AND MUTUALLY POSITIVELY CORRELATED SIMULTANEOUS  ASSOCIATED PATTERNS SYNCHRONOUSLY  In this section, we first introduce some related definitions, and then give an example to explain these definitions. Finally, we develop an efficient algorithm for mining all independent associated patterns and mutually positively correlated simul- taneous associated patterns synchronously.

According to the statistical theory, x1, x2, ? ? ? , xn are inde- pendent if ?k and ?1 ? i1 < i2 < ? ? ? < ik ? n,  P (Xi1Xi2 ? ? ?Xik) = P (Xi1)P (Xi2) ? ? ?P (Xik). (1)  However, in real database, for example in CMF database, it is almost impossible for us to get fully independent rela- tionship between any two objects. In other words, it is next to impossible that the left of Formula 1 is perfectly equal to the right of Formula 1. Therefore, in this paper, if two items have the absolute value of the correlation-confidence less than the given minimum correlation-confidence, then they are independent. As a result, for patterns with more than three items, for instance pattern ABC, even if any two items of pattern ABC is independent and also P (ABC) is closed enough to P (A)P (B)P (C), we cannot conclude that any two subsets of pattern ABC are independent. In this paper, according to the definition of an independent pattern, if a pattern with more than three items is an independent pattern, then any two subsets of this pattern must be independent.

We introduce the measure correlation-confidence to evalu- ate the degree of correlation between any two objects. The correlation-confidence of any two objects C and D is defined as follows:  ?(CD) = P (CD)? P (C)P (D) P (CD) + P (C)P (D)  . (2)  Any two objects C and D are correlated or not independent if and only if C and D have the absolute value of correlation- confidence equal to or greater than the given minimum thresh- old.

We introduce the all-confidence [10] to measure the associa- tion degree of a pattern. Let T = {ii, i2, ? ? ? , im} be a set of m distinct literals called items and D be a set of variable length transactions over T . Each transaction contains a set of items ij1 , ij2 , ? ? ? , ijk . A transaction also has an associated unique identifier called TID. A pattern X is subset of T . Let p(X) be a power set of a pattern X . The measure all-confidence (denoted as ?) of a pattern X is defined as follows:  ?= |{d|d?D?X?d}|  max{i|?l(l?p(X))?l 6=??l 6=X?i=|{d|d?D?l?d}|} . (3)  We give some definitions using the correlation-confidence and the all-confidence. We define an associated pattern, an  independent pattern, an independent associated pattern, a cor- related pattern, a mutually positively correlated pattern, and a mutually positively correlated simultaneous associated pattern as follows:  Definition 1: Pattern X is an associated pattern if and only if pattern X has the all-confidence equal to or greater than the given minimum threshold.

Definition 2: Pattern X is an independent pattern if and only if any two subsets of pattern X have the absolute value of the correlation-confidence less than the given minimum threshold.

Definition 3: Pattern X is an independent associated pattern if and only if pattern X is not only an independent pattern but also an associated pattern.

Definition 4: Pattern X is a correlated pattern if and only if it is not an independent pattern.

Definition 5: Pattern X is a mutually positively correlated pattern if and only if any two subsets of pattern X have the correlation-confidence equal to or greater than the given minimum threshold.

Definition 6: Pattern X is a mutually positively correlated simultaneous associated pattern if and only if pattern X is not only a mutually positively correlated pattern but also an associated pattern.

By the definitions, we have some conclusions as follows:  1) A pattern is an independent pattern if and only if its any subset is an independent pattern.

2) Pattern X is a correlated pattern if and only if X must have two subsets whose absolute value of the correlation-confidence is equal to or greater than the given minimum threshold.

3) If pattern X is a mutually positively correlated simulta- neous associated pattern, then any two subsets of pattern X is not only mutually positively correlated but also associated.

4) Both independent associated patterns and mutually pos- itively correlated simultaneous associated patterns have the downward closure property.

Example 1: For the transaction database TDB in Table I, let minimum all-confidence be 0.4, minimum correlation- confidence be 0.1. We have  P (CE)? P (C)P (E) P (CE) + P (C)P (E)  ? 0.06,  so the correlation-confidence of C and E is 0.06. CE is an independent pattern.

Since the correlation-confidence of both CD and DE are 0.06, CD and DE are all independent patterns. Fur- thermore, we have P (CDE) = P (E)P (CD), P (CDE) = P (C)P (DE) and P (CDE) = P (D)P (CE), so any two subsets of pattern CDE have the absolute value of correlation- confidence less than the given minimum threshold. According to the definition of an independent pattern, pattern CDE is an independent pattern. Moreover, pattern CDE has the all- confidence greater than 0.4, so pattern CDE is an associated     TABLE I THE TRANSACTION DATABASE TDB  Transaction id Items 10 A,B,C,D 20 C,D,E 30 A,C,D,E 40 D,E 50 C,E, F 60 B,F  pattern. Thus, pattern CDE is an independent associated pattern. We also have  P (AC)? P (A)P (C) P (AC) + P (A)P (C)  = 0.4.

So pattern AC is a correlated pattern. Consequently, all super patterns of AC are correlated patterns, for instance pattern ACD is a correlated pattern.

From this example, we can see that any subset of indepen- dent pattern CDE is an independent pattern. While not all subsets of correlated pattern ACD are correlated pattern. One case is that CD is not a correlated pattern. In light of the definition of a mutually positively correlated pattern, pattern ACD is not a mutually positively correlated pattern. However, pattern AC is not only a mutually positively correlated pattern but also an associated pattern. Namely, pattern AC is a mutually positively correlated simultaneous associated pattern.

It is highly possible that both pattern CDE and pattern AC are more interesting than correlated pattern ACD even if all of them have the same support. We can conclude that both pattern CDE and pattern AC might have probability greater than pattern ACD to be paired or grouped drugs.

Following is Algorithm 1 for mining all independent associ- ated patterns and mutually positively correlated simultaneous associated patterns synchronously.

Remark 1: In Algorithm 1, the prune step is performed as Algorithm 2.



III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS  In this section, we report our experimental results. All experiments are performed on two kinds of datasets:  1) A dense dataset, mushroom characteristic dataset, which consists of 8,124 transactions, each with an average length of 23 items.

2) A sparse dataset, CMF dataset, which consists of 4,643 formulas with 21689 kinds of drugs involved, each with an average length of 10 kinds of drugs.

We mine all independent associated patterns and mutually positively correlated simultaneous associated patterns syn- chronously in the two databases.

All-C, IAP, MPCSAP, CSAP, Corr-C in Table II and Table III represent all-confidence, independent associated patterns, mutually positively correlated simultaneous associated pattern- s, correlated simultaneous associated patterns and correlation- confidence respectively.

Output: The complete set of all independent associated patterns and mutually positively correlated simultaneous associated patterns.

From Table II, we can see that for the minimum correlation-confidence 1% and the minimum all- confidence 90%, there are 7 independent associated patterns, 5 mutually positively correlated simultaneous associated patterns and 8 correlated simultaneous associated patterns in mushroom dataset. From Table II, we have conclusions:  1) Not all associated patterns are correlated even if the minimum all-confidence is much high and the minimum correlation-confidence is quite low.

2) The number of both independent associated patterns and mutually positively correlated simultaneous associated patterns is significantly less than the number of cor- related simultaneous associated patterns on mushroom dataset.

3) There exists lots of independence or mutually positively correlated relationships between items in an associated pattern.

4) Both independent associated patterns and mutually pos- itively correlated simultaneous associated patterns are more special than correlated simultaneous associated patterns.

Table III shows the number of independent associated pat- terns, mutually positively correlated simultaneous associated patterns and correlated simultaneous associated patterns gener- ated in CMF database as the minimum correlation-confidence varies from 0.05 to 0.3 with the fixed minimum all-confidence 10% and minimum support 1%. To our surprise, when the minimum correlation-confidence is 5%, there are only 0.28% independent patterns in TCM dataset, while there are 16% independent patterns in mushroom dataset. Therefore, we have a conclusion that there are a large number of correlation relationships in TCM dataset. The experimental results are basically consistent with our expectation. Experts of TCM point out that both independent associated patterns and mu- tually positively correlated simultaneous associated patterns are special. Many of them are interesting and have greater probability to be paired or grouped drags even if the minimum support is set to be relatively low.

From experimental results, we can conclude that in order to find new paired or grouped drugs, it is of the great necessity for us to mine all independent associated patterns and mutually positively correlated simultaneous associated patterns synchronously. We can also conclude that the techniques developed in this paper are effective and correct.



IV. CONCLUSIONS Correlated patterns satisfy the upward closure property, i.e.

if a pattern is a correlated pattern, then its any super pattern is a correlated pattern. So long correlated patterns have no much statistical significance even if they are associated patterns. In this paper, in order to get more special patterns, we mine all independent associated patterns and mutually positively  TABLE II NUM.

An effective algorithm is developed for discovering all such kinds of patterns, especially for finding long such kinds of pat- terns. Experimental results on CMF database and mushroom database show that the techniques are feasible and correct.

Experimental results also show the great necessity of finding independent associated patterns and mutually positively cor- related simultaneous associated patterns synchronously. In the future work, we will take into account the order of various kinds of drugs in CMF database to attack the problem of how to discover new paired or grouped drugs.
