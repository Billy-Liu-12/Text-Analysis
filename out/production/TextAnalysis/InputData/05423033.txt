Mining Changes in Purchase Behavior in Retail Sale

AbstractChange mining gives an insight to the retailers on the  changing purchase patterns of the shoppers. Purchase pattern of  shoppers sometimes depends on other products purchased.

Hence, conditional part of a pattern in the form of an association  rule contains products. The research paper proposes an  approach for change mining where conditional part may contain  products or items.

I. INTRODUCTION  Marketing strategy in retailing is improved by  understanding the shoppers behavior. Retailers try to learn on  how they think, feel, reason, and select between different  alternative brands or products. In view of competitive  environment in retailing, it has become necessary for the  retailers to understand the purchase behavior of consumers.

The consumers shopping record (e.g., products purchased,  frequency of shopping, monetary value of shopping etc.) and  demographic information (e.g., income, educational level of  adults in the household, occupations of adults, ages of children,  whether the family owns a house etc.) are the primary inputs  used for mining purchase behavior of the shoppers. With  changes in income, cost of living, number and age of the  children, social and cultural forces, purchase behavior of a  shopper may change with time. For retailers, it is necessary to  learn these changes. In the parlance of data mining, discovering  the changes in purchase behavior using data mining techniques  is known as change mining. Purchase behavior is generally  represented by the association rules in the following forms.

? Gender = Male => Purchase = Snack Foods  ? Gender = Female and Age = [30-40] =>  Purchase = Vegetables and Snack Foods  The symbol, =>, is read as associates. LHS of => is  known as antecedent or, condition and RHS of => is  known as consequent. First example says that if a    customer happens to be male, he is very likely to  purchase snack foods. The second example says that if  a customer happens to be female of age in between 30 to  40, she is very likely to purchase vegetables and snack  foods.

Strength of an association rule is measured in terms of  support, confidence and lift. With total no. of  transactions (rows) of N in the database, for an  association rule, X => Y,  Support of X=>Y = n(XY)/N, where, n(XY) is number  of transactions (rows) with both X and Y present.

Confidence of X=>Y = [n (XY)]/[n (X)], where, n(X)  is number of transactions (rows) with X present.

Lift of X=>Y =   (Confidence of the rule)/(Support of  Y)  =   [n (XY)/n (X)] / [n (Y)/N], where,  n(Y) is number of transactions (rows) with  Y present.

= [n (XY). N] / [n (X). n (Y)]  Various aspects of changes in purchase behavior can be  explained as given below.

? A purchase behavior exists in period, P-1, and it  does not exist in the next period, P-2.

? A purchase behavior does not exist in period, P-  1, and it exists in the next period, P-2.

? A purchase behavior exists in both P-1 and P-2,  but with different degrees of intensities given by  the strength of the association rule.

? A particular attribute is with different values in  P-1 and P-2, although otherwise, same purchase  behavior exists in both the periods.

Four types of change patterns in purchase behavior as  available in literature are emerging Patterns, added  patterns, perished patterns and unexpected changes ([1],  [2], [3], [4]). These patterns have been explained below.

Emerging patterns are association rules existing in both  present and past. Supports of emerging patterns  generally vary from period, P-1 to next period, P-2.

Emerging patterns may be positive with increase in  support and negative with decrease in support.

Example of emerging pattern, (a, b) => (c, d).

78978-1-4244-4791-6/10/$25.00 c2010 IEEE    In P-1, association rule, (a, b) => (c, d) with support =  30%  In P-2, association rule, (a, b) => (c, d) with support =  40%.

Added pattern is a new pattern found in the present  which was not existing in the past. Generally, all  conditional and consequent parts of an association rule  (added pattern) in period, P-2, differ significantly from  any association rule in previous period, P-1.

Perished pattern is a vanished pattern found in the past  but not in the present. Generally, all conditional and  consequent parts of an association rule (perished pattern)  in period, P-1, differ significantly from any rule in next  period, P-2.

Unexpected change may be with unexpected  consequent change, where the conditional parts remain  same, but the consequent parts change with time, or, it  may be with unexpected conditional change, where, the  consequent parts remain same, but the conditional parts  change with time.

Measure of rule similarity in two periods under study is  used for mining emerging patterns, added patterns and  perished patterns, whereas measure of unexpectedness is  used for mining the patterns of unexpected change.

The work in [2] developed the similarity measure to  analyze the degree of similarity between patterns at  different periods of time. However, the application of  this measure is limited to cover only single item in the  consequent (i.e., RHS of an association rule). Paper [5]  gives a modified similarity measure to address more than  one item in the consequent part and rule-similarity is  measured as the product of LHS-similarity and RHS-  similarity.

Hence, Rule-Similarity = LHS-Similarity x RHS-  Similarity.

A rule in one period is compared with all the rules of  another period and rule-similarities are measured.

Maximum of all these rule-similarities is called  maximum rule similarity for the rule under  consideration. Maximum rule similarity is one for two  exactly same rules with same antecedents and  consequents, although strength of the rules may be    different. Research in [5] gives an approach to mine  changes in the patterns as discussed in the next  paragraphs.

A rule will be called an emerging pattern, if its similarity  is 1 with a rule mined from the data of another period.

Requirement for emerging pattern is that its maximum  rule similarity is 1.

For perished pattern and added pattern, rule matching  threshold (RMT) for similarity is used to measure the  degree of change. A rule will be called a perished pattern  if maximum rule-similarity of this rule with the rules in  later period is less than RMT. Similarly, a rule will be  called an added pattern if maximum rule-similarity of  this rule with the rules in earlier period is less than  RMT.

As mentioned earlier, measure of unexpectedness is used  for mining the patterns of unexpected change. A  threshold value of unexpectedness is used to measure  the degree of change.  Requirement for unexpected  consequent pattern is that the value of unexpectedness is  1 and requirement for unexpected conditional pattern is  that the unexpectedness is -1.

The work in [5] does not consider products in LHS of a  pattern depicted by association rule. For rules containing  products in LHS (antecedent or, conditional part) and  RHS (consequent part) both, existing similarity measure  can not be simply extended without an appropriate  modification for the measure of similarity.



II. PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION  There are many patterns observed in retail sale where we  find products in the conditional part ([6], [7]). In view of the  fact that there is no existing work for change mining where a  product or a number of products find place in the conditional  (also known as antecedent) part, an attempt has been made to  give a measure for similarity in such cases. To explain the case  further, let us consider the following two situations.

Situation-I:  Patterns in period-1 and period-2 are as given below.

Period-1: (a, b) => (c, d), where, all a, b, c and d are  products.

Period-2: (e, f) => (g, h), where, all e, f, g and h are  products.

As per the existing measure, i.e., Chen et al. (2005), rule  similarity can be measured in the following way.

(Number of common features/products  in LHS of two rules)  LHS-Similarity = ----------------------------------------------  (Total number of features/products  included  in the LHS of both the rules)  (Number of features/products with same  attribute-values in LHS of the rules)  x   ---------------------------------------------------  (Number of common features/products  in LHS of two rules)    2010 IEEE 2nd International Advance Computing Conference 79  (Number of common products  in RHS of two rules)  RHS-Similarity = ---------------------------------------------  (Total number of products included  In the RHS of both the rules)  (Number of products with same  attribute-values in RHS of the rules)  x   ---------------------------------------------  (Number of common products  in RHS of two rules)  LHS-Similarity = 0  RHS-Similarity = 0  Rule-Similarity = 0 x 0 = 0  Situation-II:  Period-1: (a, b) => (c, d)  Period-2: (c, d) => (a, b)  Here,  LHS-Similarity = 0  RHS-Similarity = 0  Rule-Similarity = 0 x 0 = 0  Hence, it is observed that rule-similarity is same (zero)  in both situation-I and II, although situation-II demands  higher rule-similarity. It is because in situation-II,  simultaneous purchase of all four items a, b, c, d enjoys  very high support (without high support, a rule is not  considered a valid pattern) in both P-I and P-2. In brief,  conditional parts may be dissimilar, consequent parts  may also be dissimilar; however, overall purchase may    be a simultaneous purchase of a number of items.

Simultaneous purchase of items itself is a purchase  pattern. It is observed that the existing measure can not  measure the similarity in appropriate way as it is  expected from practical point of view in retailing. There  may be other cases also where the existing measure of  similarity is not appropriate to depict the reality. The  problem chosen in this research paper is to develop an  appropriate measure for similarity in the context of  change mining where, conditional part may also contain  products or items.



III. NEW APPROACH FOR CHANGE MINING  As discussed in last section, similarity with respect to  overall purchase of items must be accounted for while  computing rule similarity. Hence, while computing overall  rule-similarity; overall product-similarity should also be a  factor along with LHS-similarity and RHS-similarity.

Hence, Overall Rule-Similarity =  LHS-Similarity  x RHS-Similarity  x Overall-Product-  Similarity  Overall rule-similarity in the new approach is a product  of three fractions in contrast to a product of two fractions  in the old approach. Hence, rule matching threshold  (RMT) for similarity in the new approach is to be kept at  lower value than that in the old approach.



IV. ILLUSTRATION WITH AN EXAMPLE  Eleven (11) items have been considered in a retail sale store  with one thousand (1,000) past sale transaction data along with  the profiles of the customers. To understand the database, as it  is not possible to show 1,000 records of the database in this  paper, five illustrative records have been shown in Table 1  from which one can visualize various fields in the database.

Eleven items have been named as  a, b, c, d, e, f, g,  h, i, j and k in this table. Out of one thousand (1,000)  transactions, first five hundred (500) occurred in the first  period (P-1) and rest five hundred (500) happened in the  second period (P-2).  A transaction contains the items  purchased by a customer along with a small profile of the  customers.  The profile contains value (as rated by the  retailer), pmethod (payment method by cheque/cash/card  etc.), sex (Male/Female expressed in M/F), hometown    (yes/no), income and age. Customer id has not been shown  in this table. Customer id is an identification code for the  customer and it finds use for capturing the sequence of  purchases made by the same customer and hence in mining  sequence rules. Otherwise, customer id is not of any use for  mining other patterns.

TABLE I. SALE TRANSACTION DATA WITH CUSTOMER  PROFILE SHOWING FIVE TRANSACTIONS  CUSTOMER PROFILE ITEMS  V  A  L  U  E    P  A  Y  M  E  N  T  M  E  T  H  O  D    S  E  X    H  O  M  E  T  O  W  N  (    Y  /N  )  IN  C  O  M  E  (  IN  $  T  H  O  U  S  A  N  D  S  )  A  G  E    a b c d e f g h i j k  43 CH M N 27 46 F T T F F F F F F F T  25 CS F N 30 28 F T F F F F F F F F T  21 CS M N 13 36 F F F T F T T F F T F  24 CD F N 12 26 F F T F F F F T F F F  19 CD M Y 11 24 F F F F F F F F F F F  In Table I, T (under Items) implies purchase of the  corresponding item in the corresponding transaction and  F (under Items) implies that the corresponding item  has not been purchased in the corresponding transaction.

80 2010 IEEE 2nd International Advance Computing Conference  A. Analysis  Two patterns as obtained from data mining of the above  data have been considered for analysis in this paper. As  discussed earlier, rule matching threshold (RMT) for similarity  in the new measure is to be kept at lower value than that in the  existing measure. RMTs for the existing measure and new    measure have been kept at 0.6 and 0.3 respectively.

(i) (Sex=M, Income<16650) => Canned Veg.

The above rule exists in both the periods, P-1 and P-2.

Hence, it is an emerging pattern. However rule support  reduces from 15.2 % in P-1 to 11.4% in P-2. As the  support reduces, the pattern is a negative emerging  pattern in both the existing and proposed measures.

(ii) (Sex=M, Income<16650, Frozen Meal) => Canned  Veg.

The rule exists only in the period-I.

As per the existing measure:  Maximum rule similarity = 0.5. It happens with the  following rule of period-II.

(Sex=M, Income<16650, Beer) => Canned Veg.

For RMT = 0.6, the considered rule is a perished  pattern.

As per the proposed measure:  Maximum rule similarity = 0.33. It happens with the  following rule of period-II.

(Sex=M, Income<16650) => (Canned Veg, Frozen  Meal).

For RMT = 0.3, the considered rule is not a perished  pattern.



V. CONCLUSION  To accommodate products in the conditional part of a  pattern, a new approach for measuring similarity as a basis for  change mining has been proposed in this research paper. The  suggested approach can be used for mining more realistic  change patterns in purchase behavior of the shoppers in  retailing. This is more relevant as we find patterns with  products as conditional part in many retail cases.
