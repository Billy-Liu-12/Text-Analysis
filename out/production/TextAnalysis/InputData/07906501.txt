fuzzy logic methods because the fuzzy logic system can be used as an approximator in existing literature such as [1], [2].

By designing fuzzy state observer, a more advanced fuzzy adaptive output feedback failure compensation control method has been proposed in [3] for a class of stochastic non- linear systems with actuator faults. By establishing new Nussbaum gain theorem and decartelized neural networks states observers, Li and Tong [4] achieved the output feedback fault tolerant control objective for nonlinear interconnected large-scale systems with actuator faults, and the result is very attractive and important. Especially, the Takagi?Sugeno (T?S) fuzzy models [5] described by a set of IF-THEN rules were applied to represent a large class of nonlinear systems and some important results of fuzzy state/output feedback control designs based on T?S fuzzy models were reported in [6]?[8] and references therein. In like manner, T?S fuzzy models have also been utilized to cope with nonlinear filtering [9]?[11], nonlinear tracking control [12], nonlinear adaptive sliding mode control [13], and so on.

In [14], model reduction problem has been solved for T?S fuzzy switched systems with stochastic perturbation, which is converted into a convex optimization problem by using a linearization procedure, while in [15], the full-order output feedback control problem with the Hankel-norm performance has been solved by the fuzzy-basis-dependent Lyapunov func- tion approach and the conversion on the Hankel-norm con- troller parameters. Nevertheless, most existing approaches are on account of quadratic-type Lyapunov functions which may lead to result of conservatism. Therefore, much effort has been given for the sake of reducing the conservatism [16], [17].

Recently, inspired by prosperous applications of homogenous polynomial solutions [18], relaxed results based on homoge- nous polynomially parameter-dependent Lyapunov functions (HPPD-LFs) have been transferred to fuzzy stabilization in the discrete-time domain [19]?[23]. However, even though the distribution of all involved normalized fuzzy weight- ing functions always varies at two adjacent sampled points, this reality is ignored and the obtained results must fit for all possible distributions, i.e., much conservatism has been introduced. So, it is notable to point that there is still considerable room for further improvement if one  See http://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/rights/index.html for more information.

can propose more advanced HPPD-based techniques in the future.

On another forward position of research, the development of fault detection and isolation and fault tolerant control has received considerable attention since many practical con- trol systems are subject to possible component malfunctions that may cause significant performance degradation and even instability of the system [24]?[27]. As an important branch, the problem of nonlinear fault detection/estimation has been intensively studied and a lot of important results have been proposed in [28]?[32], respectively. In particular, Li et al. [29] proposed a novel input?output approach for fuzzy fault detec- tion. Based on the given approach in [29], the problem of fault detection was converted into another filtering problem and landmark solvability conditions were established. For the special case that external noises/disturbances belong to the certain finite-frequency range [33], the problem of fault esti- mation (FE) regarding the finite-frequency range has also been well studied in [34]?[36]. Since the results based on the design of the entire-frequency domain always work well for more common cases such that the finite-frequency range of external noises/disturbances are uncertain, it is a meaning- ful topic for investigating the problem of relaxed fuzzy FE under the entire-frequency domain framework. For example, with the help of the powerful piecewise Lyapunov func- tions [37], FE observer design for discrete-time T?S fuzzy systems has been studied in [38]. However, very few results address the problem of fuzzy FE regarding the HPPD-based technique, let alone develop more advanced HPPD-based tech- niques than previous ones. Therefore, further studies in this field should be investigated, which motivates us to present this paper.

The contribution of this paper is to ameliorate fuzzy FE observer design via HPPD-LFs. Different from previous results in the literature, a novel framework of the fuzzy FE observer is established by the aid of proposing a maximum?minimum-priority-based switching mechanism. For every activated switching case, a targeted result can be achieved by means of developing an important property of improved homogenous polynomials. Since the help- ful information of the underlying system is duly updated and effectively utilized at every sampled point, the con- servatism of previous results can be availably reduced.

Furthermore, the proposed result is further improved by eliminating those redundant terms of the introduced matrix- valued variables. Simulation results based on a discrete- time nonlinear truck-trailer model are provided to show the advantages of the theoretic result that is developed in this paper.

Notations: In this paper, the involved notations are fairly standard with previous literature. For example, R represents the set of real numbers, Z+ stands for the set of posi- tive integers, N stands for the set of natural numbers, i.e., {0, 1, 2, . . .}. Furthermore, p! means the factorial, i.e., p! = p(p ? 1)(p ? 2) ? ? ? (2)(1) for p ? N. Particularly, one defines the left-hand side of a relation as Left(?), and He(M) represents M + MT .



II. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION AND PRELIMINARIES  As displayed in [38], the overall T?S fuzzy model for discrete-time nonlinear systems with faults is described as follows: ? ??  ??  x(t + 1) =?ri=1 hi(z(t))(Aix(t)+ Biu(t)+ Eif (t) + D1iw(t))  y(t) =?ri=1 hi(z(t))(Cix(t)+ D2iw(t)) (1)  where x(t) ? Rn1 denotes system state vector, u(t) ? Rn2 means control input vector, y(t) ? Rn3 is measurable out- put vector, f (t) ? Rn4 is process/actuator fault vector, and w(t) ? Rn3 are composed of disturbance and model uncer- tainties which are assumed to lie in l2[0,?). Without loss of generality, the number of measurable output channels is bigger than or equal to the number of input ones, i.e., n3 ? n4. z(t) represents the fuzzy premise variable, hi(z(t)) represents the ith current-time normalized fuzzy weighting function. Ai ? Rn1?n1,Bi ? Rn1?n2,Ei ? Rn1?n4,D1i ? R  n1?n5,Ci ? Rn3?n1, and D2i ? Rn3?n5 are constant real matrices. Moreover, it is supposed that Ei and Ci are of full rank, i.e., rank (Ei) = n4 and rank (Ci) = n3, the pair of (Ai,Ci) should be observable.

In order to estimate the fault f (t), the following structure of full-order FE observer is usually applied in the reported literature such as [38]:  ? ????  ????  x?(t + 1) = Az(t)x?(t)+ Bz(t)u(t)+ Ez(t) f? (t) + L(h)(y(t)? y?(t))  y?(t) = Cz(t)x?(t) f? (t + 1) = f? (t)+ F(h)(y(t)? y?(t))  (2)  with Az(t) = ?ri=1 hi(z(t))Ai,Bz(t) = ?r  i=1 hi(z(t))Bi,Ez(t) =?r i=1 hi(z(t))Ei,Cz(t) =  ?r i=1 hi(z(t))Ci; L(h) ? Rn1?n3 , and  F(h) ? Rn4?n3 are observer gain matrices to be confirmed.

Let ex(t) = x?(t)? x(t) and ef (t) = f? (k)? f (k), an important  result can be obtained as follows.

Lemma 1 [38]: Providing a circular region D(?, ? )  (i.e., center ? + j0 and radius ? ) and a prescribed H? performance level ? . If there exist two symmetric positive- definite Lyapunov matrices P1(h) ? R(n1+n4)?(n1+n4) and P2(h) ? R(n1+n4)?(n1+n4), matrix L?(h) ? R(n1+n4)?(n3), and P1(h),P2(h), and L?(h) are all dependent on the weighting functions at time t, such that the following conditions hold: [?P1(h) P1(h)A?z(t) ? P1(h)L?(h)C?z(t) ? ?P?1(h)  ? ?? 2P1(h+) ]  ? 0 (3) ?  ? ? ?  ?P2(h) ?12 ?13 0 ? ?P2  ( h+ )  0 I?n4? ? ?33 0 ? ? ? ?? In4?n4  ?  ? ? ? ? 0 (4)  with ?12 = P2(h)A?z(t) ? P2(h)L?(h)C?z(t), ?13 = P2(h)L?(h)D?2z(t) ? P?2(h)D?1z(t), ?33 = ?? I(n4+n5)?(n4+n5); P1(h+) is the derivative of P1(h) at time t + 1, and P2(h+) is the derivative of P2(h) at t + 1  L?(h) = [  L(h) F(h)  ]  , A?z(t) = [  Az(t) Ez(t) 0n4?n1 In4?n4  ]    This article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue of this journal.

XIE et al.: FE OBSERVER DESIGN FOR DISCRETE-TIME T?S FUZZY SYSTEMS ON HPPD-LFs 3  C?z(t) = [  Cz(t) 0n3?n4 ] , D?1z(t) =  [ D1z(t) 0n1?n4 0n4?n5 In4?n4  ]  D?2z(t) = [  D2z(t) 0n3?n5 ] , I?n4 =  [ 0n1?n4 In4?n4  ]  .

Then all the eigenvalue of A?z(t) ? L?(h)C?z(t) can belong to D(?, ? ) and the H? performance index ?ef (t)?2 ? ? ??(t)?2 is satisfied.

Next, some important definitions, which are borrowed from those given in [18]?[20] and other reported literature therein, are displayed as follows.

While the set ?r is defined as ?r = {? ? Rr;?ri=1 ?i = 1;? ? 0}, one can define ?k11 ?k22 ? ? ??krr , ? ? 	r, ki ? Z+, i = 1, 2, . . . , r as the monomials with k = k1k2 ? ? ? kr.

Pk ? Rn?n,?k ? K(g), g ? Z+ stand for matrix-valued coefficients. It is rather notable that K(g) represents the set of r-tuples which is consist of all possible combinations of nonnegative integers ki, i ? {1, . . . , r}, such that ?ri=1 ki = g.

For two r-tuples k and k?, one defines k ? k? if the fact is satisfied: ki ? k?i, ?i ? {1, . . . , r}. The usual operations of summation, k+k?, and subtraction, k?k? (whenever k ? k?), are both defined componentwise. Employing two key definitions for the r-tuple ?i ? K(1) and the coefficient ?(k), ?k ? K(g) as that displayed in [20]  ?i = 0???? 1th element  ? ? ? 0 1???? ith element  0 ? ? ? 0???? rth element  ?(k) = (k1!)? ? ? ? ? (kr!). (5) Similar to those displayed in [20], some abbreviations are  also applied in this paper for saving typed room ? ??  ??  hi = hj(z(t)), h+j = hj(z(t + 1)) h+ = (h+1 , . . . , h+r  )T , h+k = h+1 k1h+2 k2 ? ? ? h+r kr  h = (h1, . . . , hr)T , hk = hk11 hk22 ? ? ? hkrr .

(6)  where one has k = k1k2 ? ? ? kr.

In order to clearly explain the above notations, some  illustrative examples are displayed here. Provided several homogeneous polynomials with g = 3 and r = 3 vari- ables, one gets ?1 = 1 0 0, ?2 = 0 1 0, ?3 = 0 0 1, ?(2 0 1) = (2!) ? (0!) ? (1!) = 2, K(g) = {300, 030, 003, 210, 201, 120, 021, 102, 012, 111} and h201 = h21h  2h  3, h  +111 = h+1 1h+2 1h+3 1.

Finally, an important property and a useful technical lemma  are provided as follows.

Property 1: Provided g1 and g2 satisfying g1, g2 ? Z+, a  set of matrices Xim for i,m ? {1, . . . , r} and i ?= m, Yjn for j, n ? {1, . . . , r} and j ?= n, the equality (7) always is satisfied ?  (m?{1,...,r}m ?=i )  (hi ? hm)Xim + ?  (n?{1,...,r}n?=j )  ( hn ? hj  ) Yjn  = ?  ( k?K(g1) k??K(g2))  ? ??  ?? hkh+k  ? ?  ? ??  ??  ?  (l?{1,...,r}k??l?0 )  ?kk?l?ijl  ? ??  ??  ? ??  ??

?(k ? ?l)  (g2)!

?(k?)  ?ijl =  ? ??  ??  ? m?{1,...,r},m?=i Xim + Yjl , for l = i  ?Xil ? ?  n?{1,...,r},n?=j Y j n, for l = j  ?Xil + Yjl , for l ?= i, l ?= j.

anx1 ? ? ? anxnx  ?  ? ? ? Rnx?nx w  with aij = aji = 0 for i ? A1 ? {1, . . . , nx}, j ? A2 ? {1, . . . , nx}, nx ? Z+ and A1 ? A2 = ?, then there exits a matrix  Y = ?  ? ?  y11 ? ? ? y1nx ...

. . .

ynx1 ? ? ? ynxnx  ?  ? ? ? Rnx?nx  such that A + Y ? 0 is ensured is equivalent to there exits a matrix  Y? = ?  ? ?  y?11 ? ? ? y?1nx ...

y?nx1 ? ? ? y?nxnx  ?  ? ? ? Rnx?nx  with y?ij = 0 for i ? A1 and j ? A2 such that A + Y? ? 0.

Proof: The proof is twofold as follows.

1) There exists a feasible Y? satisfying A + Y? ? 0? there  exists a feasible Y satisfying A + Y ? 0.

2) There exists a feasible Y satisfying A + Y ? 0 ? there  exists a feasible Y? satisfying A + Y? ? 0.

First, the proof of 1) is given as follows. Since Y? belongs to  a special case if Y , it is evidently found that 1) always holds on.

Second, the proof of 2) is given as follows. In order to certify that A + Y? ? 0 once A + Y ? 0 is satisfied, we assume that there is one vector  ? =  ?  ? ? ? ?  ?1 ?2 ...

?nx  ?  ? ? ? ?  such that ?T(A + Y?)? > 0. Recalling that ?T(A + Y)? ? 0, i.e., ?T(A + Y?)? + ?T(Y ? Y?)? ? 0, one can conclude that ?T(Y ? Y?)? < 0 in this case. On the other hand, one set  ? =  ?  ? ? ? ?  ?1 ?2 ...

?nx  ?  ? ? ? ?  with  ?i = {  ??i, for i ? A1, i ? {1, . . . , nx} ?i, otherwise  therefore one gets  ? T (  A + Y? ) ? = ?T  ( A + Y?  ) ? > 0  ? T (  Y ? Y? ) ? = ??T  ( Y ? Y?  ) ? > 0. (8)    This article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue of this journal. Content is final as presented, with the exception of pagination.

However, considering that ? T(A + Y)? ? 0, i.e., ? T(A + Y?)? +? T(Y ? Y?)? ? 0, there is a contradiction with (8). Thus, it can be said that 2) always holds on.



III. MAIN RESULTS  A. New Fuzzy Switching Fault Estimation Observer  First, an illustrative example is provided so as to expound the idea of the given switching mechanism (named as maximum?minimum-priority-based switching mechanism in this paper).

If the value of r is set to be 3, then all possible combina- tions of normalized fuzzy weighting functions space can be classified as r ? (r ? 1) = 6 cases.

Case 1: max{h1(z(t)), h2(z(t)), h3(z(t))} = h1(z(t)) and min{h1(z(t)), h2(z(t)), h3(z(t))} = h2(z(t)).

Case 2: max{h1(z(t)), h2(z(t)), h3(z(t))} = h1(z(t)) and min{h1(z(t)), h2(z(t)), h3(z(t))} = h3(z(t)).

Case 3: max{h1(z(t)), h2(z(t)), h3(z(t))} = h2(z(t)) and min{h1(z(t)), h2(z(t)), h3(z(t))} = h1(z(t)).

Case 4: max{h1(z(t)), h2(z(t)), h3(z(t))} = h2(z(t)) and min{h1(z(t)), h2(z(t)), h3(z(t))} = h3(z(t)).

Case 5: max{h1(z(t)), h2(z(t)), h3(z(t))} = h3(z(t)) and min{h1(z(t)), h2(z(t)), h3(z(t))} = h1(z(t)).

Case 6: max{h1(z(t)), h2(z(t)), h3(z(t))} = h3(z(t)) and min{h1(z(t)), h2(z(t)), h3(z(t))} = h2(z(t)).

In particular, if the maximum or the minimum of {hi(z(t)), i ? {1, . . . , r}} refers to two or more terms, max/min function is confirmed as the first subscript by sort- ing all the underlying subscripts in ascending/descending order, respectively. For example, for the special case of that {h1(z(t)) = (1/3), h2(z(t)) = (1/3), h3(z(t)) = (1/3)}, one gets max{h1(z(t)), h2(z(t)), h3(z(t))} = h1(z(t)) and min{h1(z(t)), h2(z(t)), h3(z(t))} = h3(z(t)). It is noting that this choosing rule makes all the emerging case independently with each other.

Evidently, a certain normalized fuzzy weighting function plays different role in different activated mode. For exam- ple, in case of mode 1, h1(z(t)) plays the most important role while h3(z(t)) plays the least important role in all {hl(z(t)), l ? {1, 2, . . . , r}}. However, this helpful information has been ignored in previous results. Now, with an interesting idea in mind, if this helpful information is integrated into fuzzy FE observer design, then the conservatism of previous results can be reduced. In order to achieve this task, a novel maximum? minimum-priority-based switching mechanism is developed by means of the following steps.

1) At every sampled point, {hl(z(t)), l ? {1, 2, . . . , r}} are sorted in descending order and then the first sub- script (recorded as i, i ? {1, 2, . . . , r}) and the last one (recorded as j, j ? {1, 2, . . . , r}) are recorded as (i, j). In particular, in case of hl1(z(t)) = hl2(z(t)), one can sort them in descending order according to their subscripts of l1 and l2.

2) Identifying the operating case in the light of the current pair of (i, j). For this paper, there exist r(r ? 1) groups of possible combinations of (i, j). Therefore, one should confirm an exclusive operating case from all the r(r?1)  groups of independent operating cases at every sampled point t.

With the aid of the mentioned fuzzy switching mechanism, a novel fuzzy switching FE observer is designed with the following forms:  ? ????  ????  x?(t + 1) = Az(t)x?(t)+ Bz(t)u(t)+ Ez(t) f? (t) + L(i, j, z(t))(y(t)? y?(t))  y?(t) = Cz(t)x?(t) f? (t + 1) = f? (t)+ F(i, j, z(t))(y(t)? y?(t))  (9)  and i, j ? {1, 2, . . . , r} and i ?= j; [  L(i, j, z(t)) F(i, j, z(t))  ]  =  {Gijzg(t)}?1 [  Lijzg(t) Fijzg(t)  ]  ; and Lijzg(t), F ij zg(t)  , Gijzg(t) belong to a set  of homogenous matrix polynomials of degree g (g ? Z+), respectively. Furthermore, one has  Lijzg(t) = ?  k??K(g)  { hk  ? Lijk? }  Fijzg(t) = ?  k??K(g)  { hk  ? Fijk? }  Gijzg(t) = ?  k??K(g)  { hk  ? Gijk? }  (10)  and, Lijk? ? Rn1?n3 , Fijk? ? Rn4?n3 , Gijk? ? R(n1+n4)?(n1+n4) belong to a set of matrix-valued variables to be confirmed.

If we let ex(t) = x?(t) ? x(t) and ef (t) = f? (k) ? f (k), then the error dynamics are given by two equations as follows:  ex(t + 1) = ( Az(t) ? L(i, j, z(t))Cz(t)  ) ex(t)+ Ez(t)ef (t)  + (L(i, j, z(t))D2z(t) ? D1z(t) ) w(t) (11)  ef (t + 1) = ef (t)? F(i, j, z(t)) ( Cz(t)ex(t)? D2z(t)w(t)  )  ? ?f (t) (12) where ?f (t) = f (t + 1)? f (t) represents its fault increment.

After analyzing the above error dynamics by the aid of (11) and (12), one gets  e?(t + 1) = (  A?z(t) ? L?ijzg(t)Cz(t) )  e?(t)  + (  L?ijzg(t)D2z(t) ? D1z(t) ) ?(t) (13)  with  e?(t) = [  ex(t) ef (t)  ]  , ?(t) = [  w(t) ?f (t)  ]  L?ijzg(t) = {  Gijzg(t)  }?1 [  Lijzg(t) Fijzg(t)  ]  , A?z(t) = [  Az(t) Ez(t) 0n4?n1 In4?n4  ]  C?z(t) = [  Cz(t) 0n3?n4 ] , D?1z(t) =  [ D1z(t) 0n1?n4 0n4?n5 In4?n4  ]  D?2z(t) = [  D2z(t) 0n3?n5 ] .

Then all the eigenvalues of A?z(t) ? L?ijzg(t)Cz(t) (i, j ?{1, . . . , r} and i ?= j) belong to D(?, ? ) and the H? performance index ?ef (t)?2 ? ? ??(t)?2 can be satisfied.

Proof: First, two key intermediate variables are defined as follows:  ?ij = [ ?  ij 11 G  ij zg(t)  A?(h)? L?ijzg(t)C?(h)? ?G ij zg(t)  ? ?? 2P1zg(t+1)  ]  (16)  ?ij =  ?  ? ? ?  ? ij 11 ?  ij 12 ?  ij 13 0? ?P2zg(t+1) 0 I?r  ? ? ?? I 0 ? ? ? ?? I  ?  ? ? ? (17)  where ?ij11 = ?Gijzg(t) ? {G ij zg(t)  }T + P1zg(t), ?ij11 = ?Gijzg(t) ? {G  ij zg(t)  }T + P2zg(t), ?ij12 = Gijzg(t)A?(h) ? L?ijzg(t)C?(h), ?  ij 13 = L?ijzg(t)D?2(h) ? G  ij zg(t)  D?1(h), P1zg(t) = ?  k???K(g){hk??P1k?? }, P2zg(t) = ?  k???K(g){hk??P2k?? }, P1zg(t+1) = ?  k???K(g){h+k ?? P1k?? }, P2zg(t+1) =  ? k???K(g){h+k  ?? P2k?? }, and  L?ijzg(t) = ?  k???K(g) hk ?? [  Lijk?? Fijk??  ]  .

At every sampled point t, the distribution of hl(z(t)), l ? {1, . . . , r} must lie in one of those r(r ? 1) independent oper- ating cases. If the activated operating case is recorded (i, j), then we have: hi(z(t)) = max{hl(z(t)), l ? {1, . . . , r}} and hj(z(t)) = min{hl(z(t)), l ? {1, . . . , r}}. Therefore, it can be found that ?ij ? 0 and ?ij ? 0 are satisfied if the following two inequalities are satisfied while X1im , X  2i m , Y  1j n , and Y  2j n are  symmetric positive-definite matrices:  ?ij + ?  m?{1,...,r},m?=i (hi ? hm)X1im  + ?  n?{1,...,r},n?=j  ( hn ? hj  ) Y1jn ? 0 (18)  ?ij + ?  m?{1,...,r},m?=i (hi ? hm)X2im  + ?  n?{1,...,r},n?=j  ( hn ? hj  ) Y2jn ? 0.

Further, another two important equalities are obtained by means of improved homogenous polynomials technique and Property 1  Left (18) = (  r?  l=1 hl  )d1( r?  l=1 h+l  )d2  ?ij  + (  r?  l=1 hl  )g+d1( r?  l=1 h+l  )g+d2 ?

(m?{1,...,r}m ?=i )  (hi ? hm)X2im  + (  r?  l=1 hl  )g+d1( r?  l=1 h+l  )g+d2 ?  (n?{1,...,r}n?=j )  ( hn ? hj  ) Y2jn  = ?  ( k?K(g+d1+1),  k??K(g+d2) )  hkh+k ?  ? ??  ?? ?  ij kk? +  ?  (l?{1,...,r}k??l?0 )  ?kk?l?ijl  ? ??  ??  (21)  where  ? ij kk? =  ?  ? ? ? ?  ? ij11 kk? ?  ij12 kk? ?  ij13 kk? 0  ? ?ij22kk? 0 ?ij24kk? ? ? ?ij33kk? 0 ? ? ? ?ij44kk?  ?  ? ? ? ?  ?kk?l, ?kk?l, ?ijl, ?ijl, ? ij11 kk? ,?  ij12 kk? , ?  ij22 kk? ,?  ij11 kk? , ?  ij12 kk? ,  ? ij13 kk? , ?  ij22 kk? , ?  ij24 kk? , ?  ij33 kk? , and ?  ij44 kk? have been displayed  in (14) and (15).

From (20) and (21), it is easy to find that (18) and (19) are  ensured if the LMIs given in (14) and (15) are satisfied. In other words, ?ij ? 0 and ?ij ? 0 can be ensured if the LMIs given in (14) and (15) are satisfied.

Here, both (P1zg(t) ? Gijzg(t))P1zg(t)(P1zg(t) ? G ij zg(t)  )T ? 0 and (P2zg(t) ? Gijzg(t))P2zg(t)(P2zg(t) ? G  ij zg(t)  )T ? 0 hold since both P1zg(t) and P2zg(t) symmetric positive definite, i.e.,  ?Gijzg(t)?{G ij zg(t)  }T +P1zg(t) ? ?Gijzg(t)P?11zg(t){G ij zg(t)  }T , ?Gijzg(t)? {Gijzg(t)}T + P2zg(t) ? ?G  ij zg(t)  P?12zg(t){G ij zg(t)  }T . Therefore, the  following two inequalities are ensured if one has ?ij ? 0 and ?ij ? 0:  [ ?1 G  ij zg(t)  A?(h)? L?ijzg(t)C?(h)? ?G ij zg(t)  ? ?? 2P1zg(t+1)  ]  ? 0 (22) ?  ? ? ?  ?2 ?3 ?4 0 ? ?P2zg(t+1) 0 I?r ? ? ?? I 0 ? ? ? ?? I  ?  ? ? ? ? 0 (23)  where ?1 = ?Gijzg(t)P?11zg(t){G ij zg(t)  }T , ?2 = ?Gijzg(t)P?12zg(t) {Gijzg(t)}T , ?3 = G  ij zg(t)  A?(h) ? L?ijzg(t)C?(h), and ?4 = L?ijzg(t)D?2(h)? G  ij zg(t)  D?1(h).

Pre- and post-multiplying (22) with  diag{P1zg(t){Gijzg(t)}?1, In1+n4} and its transpose, respectively, and pre- and post-multiplying (23) with diag{P2zg(t){Gijzg(t)}?1, In1+n4 , In4+n5 , In4} and its transpose, respectively, we can confirm  [?P1zg(t) ?1 ? ?? 2P1zg(t+1)  ]  ? 0 (24) ?  ? ? ?  ?P2zg(t) ?2 ?3 0 ? ?P2zg(t+1) 0 I?r ? ? ?? I 0 ? ? ? ?? I  ?  ? ? ? ? 0 (25)  where one has ?1 = P1zg(t)A?(h)? P1zg(t)L?ijzg(t)C?(h)? ?P1zg(t), ?2 = P2zg(t)A?(h)?P2zg(t)L?ijzg(t)C?(h), ?3 = P2zg(t)L?  ij zg(t)  D?2(h)? P2zg(t)D?1(h), and L?  ij zg(t)  = {Gijzg(t)}?1L? ij zg(t)  .

On the other hand, using Lemma 1 with P1(h) = P1zg(t+1),  P2(h) = P2zg(t+1), and L?(h) = L?ijzg(t), it can be concluded that all the eigenvalues of A?z(t)?L?ijzg(t)Cz(t) (i, j ? {1, . . . , r} and i ?= j) belong to D(?, ? ) and the H? performance index ?ef (t)?2 ? ? ??(t)?2 is satisfied if the above two inequalities (24) and (25) hold on.

Finding that (24) and (25) can be ensured by the LMIs given in (14) and (15), it is reasonable to say that all the eigenvalues of A?z(t) ? L?ijzg(t)Cz(t) (i, j ? {1, . . . , r} and i ?= j) belong toD(?, ? ) and the H? performance index ?ef (t)?2 ? ? ??(t)?2 is satisfied if the LMIs displayed by (14) and (15) are satisfied.

This completes the proof.

The proposed result is further improved by eliminating those  redundant terms of the introduced matrix-valued variables.

Then all the eigenvalues of A?z(t) ? L?ijzg(t)Cz(t) (i, j ?{1, . . . , r} and i ?= j) belong to D(?, ? ) and the H?  performance index ?ef (t)?2 ? ? ??(t)?2 is satisfied.

Proof: Using Lemma 2, it can be obtained that (26) is equiv-  alent to (15) from a certain point of view of giving different design conditions but with the same conservatism. Therefore, the conclusion of Theorem 2 evidently holds in true.

Remark 1: According to Lemma 2, the result of Theorem 1 can be further improved in Theorem 2. Specifically, the struc- tures of additional matrix variables X2im and Y  2j n are refined and  those redundant terms located at (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (3, 2), and (4, 3) of the underlying matrices are removed in Theorem 2 while there is not any conservatism introduced to be a tradeoff. In other words, the result of Theorem 2 is more efficient than the result of Theorem 1. Compared with Theorem 1, there are Nd = r(r?1)(2n1n4+n1n5+3n24+2n4n5) scalar decision variables that can be saved in Theorem 2.

Moreover, assisted by the relaxed technique of HPPD-LFs, it is obvious that: the larger pair of (g, d1, d2) is chosen, the relaxed result can be obtained. Therefore, concrete informa- tion on how to choose (g, d1, d2) can be given as follows. If the result with one fixed pair of (g, d1, d2) fail to provide any feasible solution, then one should chose another larger pair of (g, d1, d2).



IV. NUMERICAL EXPERIMENT  Example 1: Considering the same discrete-time nonlinear truck-trailer model that has been applied in [38]  x1(t + 1) = (  1 ? vT L  )  x1(t)+ vT l  u(t)  x2(t + 1) = vT L  x1(t)+ x2(t) x3(t + 1) = x3(t)+ vT sin(?(t))  y1(t) = x2(t) y2(t) = x3(t)  where x1(t) represents the angle difference between truck and trailer (in radians), x2(t) represents the angle of trailer (in radi- ans), x3(t) represents the vertical position of rear of trailer (m), and u(k) represents the steering angle (in radians). l means the length of truck, L means the length of trailer, T means sam- pling time, and v means the constant speed of backing up. As that chosen in [38], one has: l = 2.8 m, L = 5.5 m, T = 2 s, v = ?1.0 m/s, and ?(t) = (vT/2L)x1(t)+x2(t). The nonlinear system can be modeled as a two-rule fuzzy model. As a result, the above nonlinear truck-trailer model is approximated by the T?S fuzzy models as follows.

Fuzzy Rule 1: IF ?(t) is about 0, Then  x(t + 1) = A1x(t)+ B1u(t) y(t) = C1x(t).

Fuzzy Rule 2: IF ?(t) is about ?? , Then x(t + 1) = A2x(t)+ B2u(t)  y(t) = C2x(t) where one has  A1 =  ?  ? ? ? ? ?  1 ? vT L  0 0 vT  L 1 0  (vT)2  2L vT 1  ?  ? ? ? ? ? , A2 =  ?  ? ? ? ? ?  1 ? vT L  0 0 vT  L 1 0  0.01(vT)2  2L?  0.01vT  ?  ?  ? ? ? ? ?  B1 = B2 = ?  ? ?  vT  L  ?  ? ?  and C1 = C2 = [  0 1 0 0 0 1  ]  . Furthermore, the disturbance  signal w(t) is set to be w(t) = 0.08 ? rand(t), and the dis- turbance distribution matrices are chosen as D11 = D12 = [0.1 0.1 0.1]T , D21 = [0.2 0.2]T and D22 = [0.1 0.1]T .

And, one also considers actuator faults such faults usually occur in the input channel, i.e., Ei is equal to Bi. The normal- ized fuzzy weighting functions are chosen as those designed by Zhang et al. [38].

For the sake of showing the effectiveness of the results developed in this paper, previous result given in [38] and related results of this paper are all utilized to acquire their respective feasible smallest values of ?min under the same regional pole constraint D(0.5, 0.49). Specifically, six differ- ent methods are chosen for dealing with the problem of FE for the underlying system.

TABLE I FEASIBLE SMALLEST ?min FOR DIFFERENT METHODS  Method 1: [38, Th. 2].

Method 2: The new HPPF-LF without the new observer (9),  in detail, we use Theorem 1 of this paper with g = 2, d1 = d2 = 1, while X1im = 0,X2im = 0,Y1jn = 0,Y2jn = 0.

Method 3: The new observer (9) with existing piecewise LF, in detail, we use Theorem 1 of this paper with g = 1, d1 = d2 = 0, while the involved HPPD-LFs are replaced by the piecewise LFs.

Method 4: One of the new observer (9) with new HPPF-LF, in detail, Theorem 2 of this paper with g = 2, d1 = d2 = 1.

Method 5: One of the new observer (9) with new HPPF-LF, in detail, Theorem 2 of this paper with g = 2, d1 = d2 = 2.

Method 6: One of the new observer (9) with new HPPF-LF, in detail, Theorem 2 of this paper with g = 3, d1 = d2 = 3.

Based on the above specific methods, six feasible smallest ?min are obtained and they are all placed at Table I. Seen from Table I, some simulation conclusions can be summarized as follows.

1) Methods 2?6 belong to derived results of this paper and their ?min are all smaller than the counterpart given by [38] (method 1).

2) ?min of method 4 is smaller than ?min of method 2, i.e., the new observer (9) makes positive contribution to reduce conservatism.

3) ?min of method 4 is smaller than ?min of method 3, i.e., the proposed HPPF-LF makes positive contribution to reduce conservatism.

4) ?min of method 6 is smaller than ?min of method 5 while ?min of method 5 is smaller than ?min of method 4, i.e., the conservatism could be reduced step by step through enlarging the values of (g, d1, d2).

So, the reason of the improvement of conservatism is clear: both proposed HPPF-LF and new observer (9) make positive contribution to reduce conservatism.

Next, using method 4 (i.e., Theorem 2 of this paper and g = 2, d1 = d2 = 1), two sets of feasible solutions to LMIs (14) and (26) are confirmed for two operating cases.

Thus, the result is illustrated via two kinds of actuator faults.

The first fault is produced by the first equation as  f (t) = {  0, 0 ? t < 40 ( 1 ? e?0.05(2t?80)), 40 ? t ? 100  and, the other one that is geared to a time-varying case, is produced by the second equation as  f (t) = {  0, 0 ? t < 40 2 sin(0.05(6t ? 80)), 40 ? t ? 100.

Two simulation results are displayed in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively. From Figs. 1 and 2, it can be found that two FE simulation results for the two involved kinds of faults are capable of ensuring the robustness of FE. In other words, the proposed fuzzy FE design can achieve asymptotical esti- mation for monotonous/time-varying faults while the level of disturbance attenuation is superior to the previous one.



V. CONCLUSION  With the aid of developing several homogenous polyno- mial techniques, less conservative conditions of fuzzy FE observer have been obtained in this paper. A novel frame- work of the FE observer has been established with the help of a maximum?minimum-priority-based switching mechanism.

Thus, for every activated switching case, a targeted result can be implemented and the helpful information of the underlying system can be duly updated and effectively utilized at every sampled point. Furthermore, the obtained result has been fur- ther improved by eliminating those redundant terms of the introduced matrix-valued variables and becomes more effi- cient. An illustrative example of the discrete-time nonlinear truck-trailer model are implemented to show the effectiveness of the approach proposed in this paper. Future research may include prospective extensions to 2-D systems [39]?[41] and type-2 fuzzy systems [42], [43].
