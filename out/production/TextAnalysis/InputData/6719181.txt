Analysis of the Relationship between Quality of

Abstract ? Provisioning 3D video stream-based services online in an acceptable quality, even in a wireless access  environment, is a big challenge for Future Internet service  providers. Only few empirical results are known about the user  perceived quality of these kinds of services. In this paper we  describe a statistical analysis of the relationship between Quality  of Experience and service attributes for active 3D live streaming,  which was carried out in a real home scenario via an IEEE  802.11n standard based Wi-Fi access available for transferring  data at the customer side. 90 participants took part in this  investigation who watched 20 test cases of the full reference based  subjective quality test suffering Quality of Service degradations,  Wi-Fi TX-Power value changing and existence of secure and not  secure (i.e., with and without IPsec) 3D video delivery. QoE was  also affected by human factors like acceptance rate of 3D  technology by the participants and their prior technical  knowledge and experience, which could cause dissonant states of  cognitions. The investigation presented here could help in the  design of future QoE-aware 3D video streaming systems.

I. INTRODUCTION  Video streaming over the Internet is one of the most  important applications and 3D video streaming is expected to  become even more popular than 2D multimedia applications.

Colour plus depth map based stereoscopic video has attracted  significant attention in the last few years, as it can reduce  bandwidth requirements for the transmission of 3D  stereoscopic video over wireless channels like in mobile  networks.

Recently standardized wireless systems like the latest  IEEE 802.11 standards, WiMAX or Third Generation  Partnership Project (3GPP) Long Term Evaluation (LTE) and  LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) enable transmission of multimedia  data with high bandwidth requirements, but the nature of  wireless technology (characteristics of the transmission  channels) still brings up challenging issues for Future Internet  Service Providers. Satisfaction of the customer needs more  than mere network performance, classified by QoS parameters  like delay, jitter, packet loss and throughput. The enhanced  level of vision quality assessment perceived by end users ?  known as Quality of Experience (QoE) ? can currently be  performed reliably using subjective tests carried out by the end  users (ITU-T P.800) [1] which requires much more time,  money and human observers than objective measurements [2].

The Future 3D Media Internet has generated a significant  amount of research work, mostly aiming to overcome current  limitations of existing network architectures, involving content  and service mobility, introducing new forms of 3D content  provisioning and analysing the close link between QoE and  QoS for evaluation of stereoscopic images [3-6]. Several  measurements were carried out in network environment, but  deeper investigations are needed for appropriate QoE  provisioning in wireless networks. Multimedia attributes, like  video coding, bit rate, frame rate, depth of picture and motion  level of scenes also influence results [7, 8].

Our previous research efforts were focusing on  measurements based on subjective evaluation of various 3D  stereoscopic video streams, where 50 participants observed  QoE changes due to the degradation of QoS parameters,  results of which are published in [9]. We followed up on our  experiments with more subjective quality tests focusing on the  relationship of QoE and QoS in case of 3D stereoscopic video  delivery through the GPON based transport network [10, 11].

This contribution discusses some new results of subjective  tests with full-reference method carried out by 90 participants  in a real, home network scenario, where the network was a  representative combination of a GPON-based transport  network and IEEE 802.11n standard based Wi-Fi access at  customer side. This network topology is especially important  because it shows a home networking scenario where the ISP  uses optical based transport network and customers are  connected to the Internet by Wi-Fi network via Access Points.

Beyond the relationship between QoE and the degradation of  QoS, Wi-Fi TX-Power alteration was also taken into  consideration in case of statistical assessment. Since  communication and data security are often common  requirements in video streaming, measurements were made  with secure and also with public HTTP live video streaming  traffic.

This paper focuses more on the link between subjective  QoE measurement results and environmental information  available to the evaluator and highlights the alterations at  cognitive levels. We analysed the possible distortion  phenomena through Level of Comprehension (LoC) [12],  since prior technical knowledge and experience does  determine the usage of the available information.

Section II shortly  describes the used network environment. Section III discusses  the method of the performed measurements and Section IV is  focusing to the results. Finally, the paper is concluded by  Section V.



II. THE NETWORK ENVIRONMENT  The planning and realization of an appropriate network  topology (Fig. 1) was carried out in order to host the 3D  stereoscopic video measurements. A Linux OS video server  generated the HTTP output by VLC v1.1.3 program [13] on  the provider side. The 3D multimedia streams through a  GPON transport network were delivered to the customer side,  where the MS Windows OS based client through the Wi-Fi  Access Point (ASUS WL-500W) delivered HTTP live 3D  video streaming via channel 9 and video contents were  displayed on Nvidia Vision Player v1.7.5 [14]. Background  traffic was not present on the wired network, neither on the  Wi-Fi sub-network, but communication on channel 9 could be  influenced by interferences via channel 7 and channel 11  where other Access Points and computers were connected  during the measurements. Since only downstream traffic  mattered during the test cases, interferences appeared to be  disturbance from background traffic, even though no  background traffic was actually present.

Fig. 1. Network topology of the experiment  WANulator v2.0 [15] simulated different network QoS  conditions, such as jitter, packet loss and bandwidth limitation,  and the TX-Power value was set directly on the Wi-Fi Access  Point. The Wi-Fi transport on channel 9 and transports on  neighbouring channels as well were monitored by CommView  for WiFi v6.3 program [16]. Distance was fixed 4m between  the AP and client PC during the whole experiment.



III. METHOD OF MEASUREMENTS  QoE assessment is a very complicated issue due to the  numerous factors which could influence user?s evaluation of  quality most of the time. These factors, such as human factors  (e.g., prior technical knowledge, acceptance of 3D  technology), system factors (e.g., network related, like delay,  jitter, packet loss or throughput), device related (e.g., display  size and resolution) and media related factors (e.g., video  resolution, encoding, frame rate) have an observable effect to  the perception of quality during video streaming [17].

Participants being in the age range from 18 to 38 fulfilled a  list of queries gathering information like name, age, gender,  being spectacled or not and existence of prior 3D movie  experience. Users were also asked how much they are fond of  3D technology. Answers were integers in the range of 1 to 10  where 10 represented the best acceptance.

TABLE I.

Features of  this video are shown in TABLE I.

People had to evaluate the following aspects (questions)  focusing on the empirical quality of the video for 20 test cases  (see TABLE II).

Q1: Rate the continuity of the video content.

Q2: Rate the image quality.

Q3: Rate the 3D experience.

Q4: Rate the synchronization of audio/video content.

Q5: Rate the overall experience.

At first, participants watched the reference test case, which  represented the best quality, where video was transported  without any QoS parameter degradation or limitation, with  default Wi-Fi TX-Power (71mW) and with public data  transport. This was later also included in the series of test  cases (see TABLE II). From that point, people were split up  into two groups: Group A and Group B. Group A (56 people)  were participants of ?blind tests?, meaning that they did not  have any information regarding the test parameters. The  members of Group B (34 people) were aware of all the test  case parameters. The 20 test cases (TC) were scored via a 10-  point quantitative discrete scale. The reference test case was  considered to be a 10 on a scale of 10.

IV. RESULTS  Experiment results were gathered and split up by the  investigation aspects to 4 groups (security presence, Wi-Fi  TX-Power alteration, jitter degradation and packet loss  presence). Results were statistically analysed and here we  briefly explain some results of security presence and Wi-Fi  TX-Power alteration aspects, and later we more deeply  interpret relationship between subjective QoE measurement  results and the available environmental information.

A. Security Aspect  Security presence, which was presented by an OpenVPN  secure tunnel between the video server and user?s PC, caused  only insensible difference in evaluation of quality perceiving  in groups (0.90 Confidence Intervals are overlapping). Data  were encrypted by the OpenVPN?s default Blowfish cipher  algorithm. Appropriate test cases with mean QoE results for  Group A and Group B separately are shown in TABLE III.

Fig. 2. Evaluation of the best test cases: TC 9-13  In the TC without any QoS degradation the third question  (Q3) ? the 3D experience ? achieved the lowest scores in both  cases (with public data transport mean value=8.089, with  secure data transport mean value=7,464). However, the  difference between mean values for public and secure data  transport is so irrelevant (0.90 Confidence Intervals are  overlapping) that we can conclude that the presence of default  secure data transport over the OpenVPN did not cause any  notable QoE degradation.

Figure 3 shows the third question (Q3) ? the 3D experience  ? score values based on the participants acceptance for the  best TC with secure and public data transport as well.

Fig. 3. 3D experience scores based on 3D acceptance: TC 9-13  Here we can notice that users evaluated 3D quality  favourably (scored between 5 and 10) independently from 3D  display acceptance. This means that when 3D depth feature is  accurate, people are satisfied even if they prefer 2D video  display over 3D.

B. Wi-Fi TX-Power Aspect  Based on Wi-Fi TX-Power value changing while other Wi-  Fi parameters were not changed during the tests we had got  statistical mean QoE results showed in the TABLE IV.

Measurements were carried out by the AP default TX-Power  (71mW) and minimum (35mW) and maximum (251mW)  values of the AP setting The TABLE V shows summary of  traffic monitoring during the experiment carried out by one  person. Channel 9 was used only for 3D video transmit and  the traffic on channel 11 was lower one compared with  channel 9 data transmit.

The transmit  attenuation varied between 50 and 60dB, which did not reduce  the signal quality, even in case of minimum 35mW TX-Power  value, due to the irrelevant noise and short fix distance  between the AP and client PC.

Fig. 4. Mean QoE values for TC 18-4-20  Figure 4 shows mean QoE values where TX-Power value  has been changed in case of Group A for video continuity  (Q1) and 3D experience (Q3) aspects. The continuity was  more important than the 3D experience with presence of QoS  degradation (Jitter=30ms, PL=1%), but TX-Power alteration  did not affect their evaluation. The 0.95 Confidence Intervals  were overlapping.

C. Objective and subjective cognitions  This section focuses on the evaluation results of the  participants of Group B; those who were aware of the  alteration of different parameter values. In order to observe the  correlation between LoC and the available environmental  information, we divided participants into three subgroups.

Before commencement of the measurements, recorded  conversations were performed, in which each and every  participant was asked a series of questions related to  technologies involved in the measurement. These video  footages were used to allocate results into the previously  mentioned subgroups, which shall be referred to as the  different levels of comprehension. Although it is indeed a  time-consuming, prolonged method for LoC determination,  yet it minimizes inaccuracy.

Initially the results of Group B consisted of the evaluation  performed by 35 participants, but one was excluded from this  analysis. That particular test subject could not accomplish his  task properly, since he suffered a headache due to the 3D  display, which made him score 1 in every aspect of all test  cases. With the remaining 34 participants, the three  distinguished levels of LoC ? namely ?1, 0 and +1, where the  higher number represents a higher level of comprehension ?  were formed in the following order: 11 participants were  associated with level ?1 and +1, and level 0 was represented  by 12 people.

Evaluating a given service is a decision. From the  evaluator?s point of view, the conditions for making this  decision are not quite optimal during QoE feedback  measurements. Not only the limited length of test material  makes it hard to make a meticulous observation, but there is  the time pressure of making the decision as well. Of course in  some ways this statement is rather irrelevant, since  dramatically increasing material length would not result in  significant differences in mean scores, not to mention the  awareness of human attention span. Yet it needs to be noted  that a test subject with a healthy scoring attitude utilizes  everything available to make a well thought-out decision.

The core of evaluation relies on the objective cognition of  perception. However, prior information regarding the given  service may lead to the subjective cognition of preconception.

This is the point where the theory of cognitive dissonance [19]  enters the picture, especially if these cognitions contain  opposing declarations, forming a dissonant state. If objective  and subjective cognitions are in harmony, they reinforce each  other. However, if they are in contradiction, immediate  dissonance reduction is required. For the evaluator, supporting  subjective cognitions is more favourable, but it is only  possible if objective cognitions are mutable.

This entire phenomenon could be eradicated by simply  hiding or masking service attributes, but sometimes there are  hard-to-hide parameters. In a previous research [20] the  altering parameter of the service was the type of connection  (wired, wireless, and mobile), while quality itself was  completely constant. Even though there wasn?t even the  slightest difference between the test materials, only 4% of the  participants made an unvarying evaluation. On one hand,  objective cognitions showed no dissimilarities between the  given test cases, but on the other hand, subjective cognitions  suggested that there should be. Due to modification of  objective cognitions during dissonance reduction, there were  test subjects who were able to mention specific differences in  adjacent test cases during a conversation after the  measurement, like degradation of motion fluency or image  quality. Analysis based on LoC separation allowed us to  identify different evaluation patterns and behaviours.

The theory of post-decision dissonance also plays a major  role in shaping the evaluation. If there are several decisions  following each other, they need to keep a state of consistency.



I. Kulik et al. ? Analysis of the Relationship between Quality of Experience and Service Attributes for 3D Future Internet Multimedia    In the previously mentioned measurement [20], we repeated  the test cases with different display (2D and 3D). We observed  that evaluation patterns at one display were actually repeated  at the other. This occurs in two dimensions in this  measurement. First of all, the consistency between test cases  needs to be maintained, and second, the scores of evaluation  aspects (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 and Q5) must be consistent as well.

The distortion phenomena are best presented by the scores  of the test cases concerning security presence, due to the  deviating ideas regarding secure transmission. There were  typically three different subjective cognitions on security:  P1:  Secure test cases should provide a lesser performance  in quality, since resources are required to implement  secure transmission.

P2: Secure test cases should provide a better performance  in quality, since it protects transmission from hazards.

P3: Security presence should have an impact on quality.

Objective cognitions showed barely noticeable differences, in  favour of not secure test cases.

Fig. 5. Distribution of the relationship between security aspect test cases  The dark columns of Figure 5 denote the number of  participants evaluating the secure test case in the given pair  with a lesser or equal score, while light columns represent the  opposite. It can be clearly seen that the lower the LoC level is,  the more evaluators tend to be lead by a false subjective  cognition (P2). These differences also appear in the Mean  Opinion Score (see Figure 6). The presence of preconception  P2 at LoC level ?1 was so influential that in fact it was able to  alter the relation in MOS.

Fig. 6. Mean Opinion Scores of LoC levels  The light columns of Figure 6 embody the MOS values of  the secure test cases. Apart from the comparison of test case 9  and 13, all other test case pairs in the security aspect section  have inverted relations at the lowest level of LoC.

Preconception P1 also affected evaluation, primarily  utilized by participants of LoC level +1 and 0, but some test  subjects of level ?1 used it as well. However, there is a  notable difference in the reflection of this idea in scoring  behaviour. Participants belonging to level +1 used it far more  cautiously than others. This is a result of the high amount of  reinforcement of this cognition due to prior technical  knowledge and experience; although the cognition is well  supported and demands its presence in scores, it minimizes the  chance of a possible contradiction where one would need to  abandon his subjective cognition. Other participants are less  cautious in scoring, especially if cognition P3 dominates. For  instance, the first comparison results of Figure 6 show  similarity in all levels, especially between level +1 and ?1, but  the average difference in scores of test case 9 and 13      performed by test subjects supporting cognition P1 in level +1  is 0.48, while in level 0 it is 1.03, and in level ?1 it is 1.14.

Those who could not support subjective cognition P1 and P2  were lead by the trivial cognition P3, resulting mostly in  alternating scoring relations.

Due to the number and order of test cases, post-decision  dissonance was more present in the evaluation of quality  aspects than in the comparison of test cases. It would be  possible to obtain measurement results affected by distortions  with even greater intensity if there were only 8 test cases with  the following order: 9, 13, 4, 14, 7, 15, 12 and 16.

Of course the results regarding the alteration of TX-Power,  jitter and bandwidth limitation was also distorted, but the  number of opposing preconception was less and did not have  notable effects on the MOS. There were some participants  who thought that the value of bandwidth is somewhat similar  to jitter and packet loss, so it?s limitation should increase the  level of perceived quality. It was even more interesting to see  that indeed many deemed TX-Power to be related to sound  volume in behaviour; too high should be just as unflattering as  too low.



V. CONCLUSION  This paper has given a subjective test method of QoE  investigation of 3D stereoscopic video files, which results  showed an irrelevant effect of pure security presence during  the video transmission, but its combination with degradation  of QoS parameters ? like jitter and packet loss ? spectacularly  deteriorated continuity and 3D experience. The quality of 3D  presentation ? such as depth impression ? is influenced by  multimedia features as well, and dynamic, high-movement  sections in video are more sensitive to the QoS degradation. It  was proven that power efficiency can be achieved  without notable degradation of service performance. Default  transmission power is not required to be amplified; lower  transmission power could be sufficient for acceptable video  quality, under conditions that no other channel interferes  and the amount of background traffic is infinitesimal  compared to video streaming.

It has also been presented how objective and subjective  cognitions shape evaluation through cognitive dissonance.

Participants aim to support their subjective cognitions by  default, given that the differences perceived by objective  cognitions are not apparent enough. Preconceptions based on  information regarding the given service were compelling  enough to have their evident effect on the mean scores of a  specific group of participants, distinguished by Level of  Comprehension. Automated objective evaluation solutions  may exclude this distortion phenomenon from QoE  measurement results, not to mention the upsurge of cost-  efficiency and time-efficiency. The goal is the mathematical  modeling of results, which is needed for an optimal solution of  3D stereoscopic video contents delivery with appropriate  display quality. However, these possible benefits still require  further study.
