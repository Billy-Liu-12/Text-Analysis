Grey measurement based on Rough set Granule calculations

Abstract   This paper put the Rough set methodology based on  the information table disposal to expand the dual (binary) relations described by the neighborhood system. To make full use of logic operations including AND operation by-bit, XOR operation by-bit and NOR operation by-bit, gains the certain and uncertain information among the various decision-making factors. The use of knowledge related with Grey system theory, establishes their mathematical model for decision making and data mining, according to the principle of the priority of certain information in decision-making and the ambiguity degree from small to big. At last, a new method for data mining is proposed by the use of combining grey system theory and Rough set.

1. Introduction   In the early 1960s, L.A.Zadeh proposed fuzzy sets (Fuzzy Sets). Theoretical computer scientists and logician try to resolve the vague concept of G.Frege through this theory, but unfortunately, fuzzy set is not computed, and there is not mathematical formula to describe this vague concept, therefore, it is impossible to calculate the specific numbers of ambiguity element on its border.

After 20 years in the early 1980s, Z. Pawlak presents the Rough set in allusion to the borderline region thought of G. Frege, and puts those individuals, which could not be confirmed, to vest in the borderline region, which (and that borderline region) is defined as the sets of the difference between up-Approximate and under-Approximate sets. As up-Approximate sets and under-Approximate sets can be described by the assured mathematical formula that equivalence relationship given, the number of ambiguity elements can be calculated, namely the extent of ambiguity between true and false can be calculated, is so as to  achieve the borderline thought of G.Frege, which we call it the uncertain information sets. Rough sets is a new mathematical tool to handle a vague and imprecise information problem, rather than fuzzy sets (Fuzzy Sets) for the application of modern computer, this theory is undoubtedly one of the most challenging fields.

1982, Julong Deng, the Chinese scholar, Professor, created a grey system theory. Grey system theory take "small sample", "poor information" uncertainty system of "some part information known, some part information unknown " for research objects, to develop and extract valuable information mainly through the formation of "Some part" information known, and implement the correct description and effective monitoring and controlling for the action of system's operation or the law of evolution. Grey system theory major study the problem of uncertainty which probability, statistics and fuzzy math are difficult to solve. Gray number is a form of representation to gray system action. Gray degree of gray number reflects the degree of uncertainty for people?s recognition on the grey system. So a gray degree of gray number, and theoretical background or domain that gray number brings should have an inseparable relationship.

Gray number is the number which is not or can not find temporarily a white number as its "representative", such as value of the general prior forecast, and so on.

Gray number has a few several categories below: the gray number of only below-boundary, the gray number of only up-boundary, the interval gray number, the consecutive gray number and the discrete gay number, black number and white number.

2. The Information Granule and binary logical operation of Rough Set   The so-called Information Granule is the reflection of finite ability of human in processing and storing information. Owing to the finite human capacity, a   DOI 10.1109/ICICTA.2008.22    DOI 10.1109/ICICTA.2008.22    DOI 10.1109/ICICTA.2008.22     great deal of complex information was divided to some simple blocks according to their characteristic, and the block marked off like this can be seem as a Granule.

The procedure of processing information is called Information Granule. For example, Information Granule of parking lot problem is that dividing the parking lot to many blocks according to the performances ,models and sizes of cars, whereas the each block is used to park a sort of car. The blocks at this are Granule. This is an informal example of Information Granule of parking lot problem. Granule involves partition from integer to segment. More clearly, it integrates with uncertainty, comparability and functionality. It is evident that Granule performs the important role in many subjects. For example, interval analysis, quantitative analysis, blocking, rough sets theory, d-s theory, sample learning , qualitative process theory, decision tree, semantic network, constraint programming, image segmentation, group analysis and so on.

In mathematics, each individual combined with certain block clusters makes up of one neighborhood system. If all clusters in a neighborhood system are nonempty, the neighborhood system is an overlay. If all blocks constitute a partition, the neighborhood system is reduced to Rough set system. And if the discussion is restricted to real number, the neighborhood system is reduced to interval computation. Neighborhood is a common concept which has been introduced to data mining, intelligent system, soft computing and logic and so on. We commit ourselves to its structure theory, and also appeal to its represent method. So this paper extended information table process of the Rough sets methodology to the binary relation described by the neighborhood system.

The Logical algebra subject was firstly founded by English mathematician George Boolean, so people also call it Boolean algebra. Unlike ordinary algebra, the Logical algebra has different concepts. It only has two states: 0 and 1, which represent the logical relation among digits instead of the big-small relation. The logical algebra is the mathematical base of analyzing and designing digital system. The operation formula is quite different from normal operation formula, and it has three basic operations: AND, XOR, NOR.

3. The Granule logic computation based on the number of binary system   Suppose S = (U, A) is an information system, of which U={u1,u2,?,um}is individual domain, A = (a1, a2,?, am) is an attribute set. U can be divided into Equivalence class which uncrosses each other by  arbitrary subset of B, A. Equivalence class is defined as Granule, and obviously Granule is the expansion of Rough set theory, because the implementation of the Granule computation is much faster and much more flexible than that of equivalence class computation.

Table 1 gives the information systems that expert subordinate departments attach to the individual.

Table 1.Single attribute of the list Experts?  serial number  (U)  Subordinate department  (A)  Experts? serial  number (U)  Subordinate departments  (A)  u1 A1 u7 A2 u2 A2 u8 A1 u3 A1 u9 A1 u4 A3 u10 A2 u5 A4 u11 A5 u6 A3 u12 A1 We use equivalence class to define Granule, in table  1, according to the classification of two attributes include expert and subordinate departments, obtain quotient set U/IND( ? )={[A1],[A2],[A3],[A4],[A5]}, there into [A1]={u1,u3,u8,u9,u12}? [A2]={u2,u7,u10}? [A3]={u4,u6}?[A4]={u5}?[A5]={u11}. Here we call the elements --equivalence class Granule in quotient set for.

For each element in Granule, its location, using this element?s subscript denoted, can be presented in the macrocosm U. If the subscript is corresponding to the digits of binary system number, then the Granule can be defined by a number of binary system, that is, ui?U, corresponding to set the number of binary system on the corresponding i digit 1. Clearly, the length of the binary system number exactly equals to base U, such as? [A1]=101000011001,[A2]=010000100100? [A3]=000101000000,[A4]=000010000000? [A5]=000000000010 and [A1],[A2],[A3],[A4],[A5] were called separately to the names of the 1, the 2, the 3, the 4 and the 5 number of binary system.

The table 2 uses the two forms of enumerated elements and binary system number to describe the partition of U. Its first column denotes the names of elements in quotient set U / IND (A), its second column enumerates each Granule, its third column is the number of binary system, it is worth noticing that each element in quotient set all is a subset or the name of subset on the U. Compared to the number of elements on the U, the number of elements in quotient set is much smaller, so it was already a data reduction from the macrocosm to quotient set. This is the essential problem of Granule computing, and is one of     the actual contents of data mining and information decision-making.

Table 2. The representation of elements in quotient set  Granule name Granule  Granule number of binary system  [A1] {u1,u3,u8,u9,u12} 101000011001 [A2] {u2,u7,u10} 010000100100 [A3] {u4,u6} 000101000000 [A4] {u5} 000010000000 [A5] {u11} 000000000010  Table 3 is the expansion of Table 1, viz., the individual of a single attributes extends to the information table of many characters. Here only listed three characters in the information table. For the relationship in table 3, its equivalence class sets of the attribute in each column are listed below:  (1) U/IND(departments)={[A1], [A2], [A3], [A4], [A5]}; expressed 12 assessment experts are from five different departments.

(2) U/IND(assessment items)={[X1], [X2], [X3], [X4], [X5]}; expressed the five items will be evaluated.

Of which: [X1]={u1,u5,u6};[X2]={u2,u8,u12};[X3]={u3,u9,u11};[  X4]={u4};[X5]={u7, u10};expressed the experts of corresponding serial number were selected randomly will evaluate different items.

(3) U / IND (evaluation results)={[lower], [general], [excellent]}.

Of which: [lower] = {u5}; [general] = {u1, u4, u7, u10, u11};  [excellent] = {u2, u3, u6, u8, u9, u12}; expressed the evaluation results given by the experts of different serial number for assessment items.

Table 3. Multi-attribute relations list U Department(A) Assessment  items(X) Evaluation  results u1 A1 X1 general u2 A2 X2 excellent u3 A1 X3 excellent u4 A3 X4 general u5 A4 X1 lower u6 A3 X1 excellent u7 A2 X5 general u8 A1 X2 excellent u9 A1 X3 excellent u10 A2 X5 general u11 A5 X3 general u12 A1 X2 excellent The classification of the various attributes combined  Table 3 can be intuitive to elicit: more than 66% in excellent evaluation of the items is the experts from the department A1 presented; If this judgment requires us to make a detailed description, and to make a  correlation table, which Experts from various departments have done the same results of evaluation, to facilitate data mining. Data mining is usually to find the association rules given in the relations with certain form: Let X and Y are two basic sets given in the relations, if the times, which the association rules or individual given in the relations occurred, reach s% or more, we calls the association rules can be extracted, marking as (X, Y). Here given the general process for searching the association rules (X, Y):  (1) Computing the combination formats of all the X and Y may be;  (2) Counting the time which some possible formats appear in the given format;  (3) To find out the association rules of which the appearance time ? s% given in the relations.

Now in terms of these principles, we can seek the association rules through Granule computing.

Obviously, the number of the association rules (X, Y) which satisfied the conditions ? the number of Granule in quotient set, so it is another data reduction from quotient set to the association rules set.

It is one association degree between experts from different departments and the same excellent results of evaluation.

For this we fully integrate the Boolean calculation of binary digit, which puts forward more simple to determine the relations:  Table 4. Granule on-bit AND operation Combina  tion Binary AND  operation The binary numbers  results  of operation  The total number  of 1 appeared  [A2] AND [excellen t]  00        AND    [A3] AND [excellen t]  00        AND    [A4] AND [excellen t]  00       AND    [A5] AND [excellen t]  10        AND    [A1] AND [excellen t]  01        AND       In table 4 are presented the corresponding binary AND operation under the combination and gaining possession of the assessment experts? subordinate department and the excellent results of the evaluation, and their results are listed in corresponding to the right column. the assessment experts from the sector A1 and the excellent results of the evaluation are present to the bottom line in table 4, which the total number that 1 appears is 4; if s = 10, clearly A1 meet the requirements; if S = 5, At this point A1?A2?A3 are all to meet requirements, if the data mining asked to mine the two rules of the largest association degree, then how to select again from A2?A3.

In the binary on-bit XOR logic operation: while input the same two digits, it will output 0, while input the two different digits, it will output 1. In the binary on-bit NOR logic operation: what input has 1 then output 0, what input is all 0 then output 1. For the combination of the various Experts? subordinate departments and the excellent evaluation, the doneness of binary on-bit XOR and on-bit NOR operations were shown in tables 5, 6.

Table 5.

The Associated Gray Matrix of Granule computing based on the number of binary system   We can conclude clearly from Table 4, 5, 6: the sum of probability gained in the same context is 1 after the AND, XOR, NOR operation. The binary sort of table can be understood as: the sort of the voting results, 1 presented assent, 0 presented opposition. For the binary sort of excellent results of assessment, it can be represented the survey results that the projects assessed by public opinion, so that its all sort in each table remains unchanged. For U/IND (departments) ={[A1],[A2],[A3],[A4],[A5]},the different binary arrangement listed by the different departments can be understood as: the projects of assessment sort in various sectors with internal point of view. 1 or 0 are on both sides in the table 4, 5, 6, explaining the experts have the same points of view with public opinion for assessment of this project, are in favor of or against this project's implementation. If 1 and 0 on both sides are not appearance at the same time, show that opinions of group of the assessment experts and the views of public opinion on this project are different, and the implementation of this project needs to assess once again.

The results of on-bit AND operation used in this paper are defined as certainty information, that of on- bit XOR operation are defined as uncertainty information, and that of on-bit NOR operation are defined as the opposed information. The probabilities of their counterparts were expressed as: 1A A A At f t f? ?? ?  .

Obviously: the association degree of each evaluation attributes are all a grey number 1( )| A  A  f t? ?? ,     viz.: [ ]A A( ) t ,1-f? ? ? , order ( )? ? represented the corresponding grey association degree, then  Ainf ( ) t? ? = , Asup ( ) 1-f? ? = ; their whitening association degree A A( ) t (1 )(1-f ), [0,1]? ? ? ?? = + ? ? ,  when 1A At f= ? , the association degree is a white number ( ) 1A At f? ? = = ? .

The grey correlation form between experts from various departments and the results of assessment:  Table 7. The grey correlation form Evaluation  results Experts  sector   excellent   general   lower  A1 [1/3,7/12] [1/12,1/4] [0,1/2] A2 [1/12,2/3] [1/6,1/12] [0,1/3] A3 [1/12,7/12] [1/12,1/2] [0,1/4] A4 [0,7/12] [0,1/2] 1/12 A5 [0,7/12] [1/12?5/12] [0,1/6]  In information data mining, the greater degree of correlation of information, the more conducive to the information extraction and mining; in the same degree of correlation, the smaller degree of the ambiguity, the more conducive to information extraction and mining.

At this time, it should choose the information of small degree of ambiguity for extracting at first. In Table 7, the same line reflects the degree of correlation predicted by the internal experts within the same departments for the various the results of the ballots, the same column represents the degree of correlation predicted by experts in  different departments for the same voting results.

Definition 1: Suppose the background of the theory produced by gray number ? is ? , ( )? ? is the degree of measurement that Gray number ? admits the domain, then calls:  ( ) ( ) / ( )g ? ?? = ? ?                             (1) gray degree of the gray number ? .

Suppose ( ) 1? ? = , as ( ) ( ) / ( )g ? ?? = ? ? , we can obtain the gray degree between subordinate departments of assessment experts and the excellent results of evaluation:  ?1? 1 1( ) ( ) / ( ) 1/ 4A Ag ? ?? = ? ? = ; ?2? 2 2( ) ( ) / ( ) 7 /12A Ag ? ?? = ? ? = ; ?3? 3 3( ) ( ) / ( ) 1/ 2A Ag ? ?? = ? ? = ; ?4? 4 4( ) ( ) / ( ) 7 /12A Ag ? ?? = ? ? = ; ?5? 5 5( ) ( ) / ( ) 7 /12A Ag ? ?? = ? ? = .

1 2 3 4 54 /12 1/ 3, 1/12, 1/12, 0, 0A A A A At t t t t= = = = = =  1 2 3 4 5A A A A At t t t t> = > = ,  1 3 2 4 5( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )A A A A Ag g g g g? < ? < ? = ? = ? .

So we learn that A1, A3 are the two information  extracted.

5. Conclusion   From individual to global then to the classification Granule?s calculate gets a less data tables of Granule, it is said the first reduction of the individual; second according to the data tables on Granule combination and gets a combination data tables of Granule ,from the data tables we can easily find the available association rules, it corresponds to the further reduction. This paper first by the binary number bit and (AND) operator to find out the information association rules that meet the request then according to with the same certainty association rules of the information, to conduct on binary number bit or (XOR), and by-bit non ( NOR) operation. When data mining according the following rules: firstly chose that with the biggest certainty association information ; secondly chose that with less uncertainty information that own the same certainty of association ? Grayscale?s descending principles of data mining. This paper use the grey system theory and Rough set combination give a new and rapid method of extraction association rules data mining, it is significance and valuable. So it is worth for further study.
