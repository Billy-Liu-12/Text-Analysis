I.  INTRODUCTION  Mobile banking is defined as a channel whereby the customer interacts with a bank via a mobile device, such as a mobile phone or personal digital assistant [1]. It can be considered as a subset of electronic banking and an extension of internet banking with its own unique characteristics.  The first bank that launched mobile banking services was Nordea in Finland more than ten years ago. Customers were then able to make payments and ask for account balances through sending SMS. Nowadays, mobile banking services allow customers to carry out many other operations like paying different invoices and bills, trading in stock exchanges and transfer funds [1].

Being an integral part of mobile banking, mobile payment concerns mainly paying for goods and/or services via the mobile devices instead of using cash, check or credit cards [2].

Mobile payment was a success in several countries all over the world, such as NTT DOCOMO in Japan, with more than 15  million users at the end of august 2009, SAFARICOM in Kenya with its service M-PESA that counted more than 9.5 million of users at the end of March 2010 after only 3 years of existence [3]. In other countries, the implementation of such technology did not show satisfying results mainly because of inadequate marketing strategies and partnerships whose importance has been underestimated. Beenz, Flooz, Digicash, Micropay, Simplay are some examples of mobile payment experiences that did not meet success in the world [3].

In Morocco, several banks in partnership with phone operators are looking into offering mobile payment services to their customers. Some of them have already launched one aspect of mobile banking which is money transfer via mobiles.

As an example, Maroc Telecom has launched, in partnership with a major Moroccan Bank, a product of money transfer via SMS. Initially, this product consists of performing all banking transactions including depositing, withdrawing and transferring money nationally. Later on, the service provided by the phone operator will be generalized and will include products related to mobile payment. Another major Moroccan Bank has also launched a similar product called ?lilkoul?.

Before launching such a product, it is important to know if it will be accepted by end users by investigating the factors that may affect consumers? decision to adopt or not this technology.

The objective of this work is to determine the key factors that affect customer?s attitude towards the adoption of mobile payment in Morocco. The conceptual framework for this work relies on technology acceptance model (TAM) [4], which is a theoretical foundation to explain and predict the individual?s acceptance of information technology. Based on this theoretical ground, a survey was designed based on TAM and conducted among different social classes in Morocco, regardless of whether they have a bank account or not. We adopted a nontraditional approach to analyze the gathered survey data, which consists of a three-fold analysis relying mainly on data mining techniques. The results obtained show that ease of use, usefulness, risk perception and transaction fees are the main drivers of people?s intention to adopt mobile payment.

slimane Stamp      The rest of this paper is organized in four sections. In the following section, we account for literature related to the question at hand and give definitions of the key data mining techniques used in our work. Section 3, the core of the paper, is where we layout our research methodology. In section 4, we explain our empirical results. A conclusion follows.



II. RELATED WORK  In this section, we give a presentation of the mobile market in the world, then we explain the theoretical foundation behind the technology acceptance model. We also a brief background of the data mining techniques used in our work including tools for converting unsupervised learning problems into supervised learning [12, 18], random forests [13] and also association rules mining [15].

A. Presentation of the mobile payment market in the world  Mobile payment market worldwide was estimated at $3.2 billion in 2003 and at $11.7 billion in 2005 [5]. According to the same source, revenues reached around $37 billion in 2008.

Research predicted that mobile payment will grow at 68% per year worldwide and will generate total revenues of $250 billion by 2012. Hence, several banks and phone operators are moving toward mobile payment in order to take advantage of this new technology [6].

Mobile banking appeared for the first time in Finland [1] before spreading widely in Europe, Asia and America. In Africa, the first experiences started in late 2004 in South Africa. Even if the adoption of such technology appeared lately in this continent, many countries have succeeded in implementing it (the example of M-Pesa in Kenya and Wizzit in South Africa) and could therefore attract many customers [7]. Today, mobile payment is becoming a very attractive business. The number of mobile owners is competing with that of payment cards holders. In fact, while more than 4 billion of banking cards are in circulation worldwide, there are about 5 billion mobile users in 2010 [3].

Therefore, the implementation of mobile payment services requires a convergence movement between phone operators and banks in order to satisfy customers. On the financial side, banks could succeed because they developed expertise in managing account-based payments, macro payments, and in mediation of payments. On the telecom side, operators are specialized in conducting small payments, collecting payment information, and billing[8].

By adopting this new technology, financial institutions or banks will improve customer service, reduce costs, increase market share and reinforce brand image [9]. Furthermore, and according to TowerGroup, Mobile transactions costs 54 times less than transactions in bank agencies, which may offer huge opportunities to banks and mobile operators.

In Morocco, the low banking penetration rate (47% as of 2009) associated with a high number of phone holders (25 million users) offer great opportunities to financial institutions, especially banks. Adopting mobile payment services may allow them to reach people with no bank account or even recruiting new customers and improve banking penetration rate for the years to come.

The two technologies that are most used for mobile payment are based on a simple SMS (Short Message Service) or NFC (Near Field Communication), which consists on connecting the handheld to payment devices without any physical contact. These two technologies allow exchange of data between the phone and a payment terminal. According to Gartner, they represent 94% of the technologies used to make transactions in 2012 [3].

B.  Defining the Technology Acceptance Model The technology acceptance model (TAM) [10],  represented in Figure 1, is a theoretical foundation to explain and predict the individual?s acceptance of information technology. The technology acceptance model (TAM) is widely used by researchers to come up with explanations of usage behavior of adopting information technology. It is also the theoretical framework that we used in this work to explain Moroccans behavior towards the adoption of mobile payment.

This model was developed in 1989 by Davis in order to explain computer-usage behavior. It is an adaptation of the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), established earlier (1975) by Fishbein and Ajzen?s, which suggests that social behavior is motivated by the attitude and intention to perform [11].

Fig.1: Technology Acceptance Model   The new technology acceptance model suggests that when  users are to use a new technology, the Perceived usefulness (PU) and Perceived Ease-Of-Use (PEOU) are two factors that influence their decision about how and when they will use it.

The perceived usefulness is defined as the degree to which a person believes that using this technology would improve their life and enhance their job performance. The perceived ease-of- use is the degree to which a person believes that using this technology would be easy.

C. Transforming a density estimation problem into one of supervised function approximation  To test the quality of the questionnaire that we built to test our TAM based model, we relied on a technique for transforming a density estimation problem into one of supervised function approximation [12, 18] which is carried out as follows:  Suppose f(x) is an unknown density for estimation and f0(x) is a specified reference density function. For example, f0(x) might be the uniform density over the range of the variables.

Assume that the data set x1; x2?xn is an i.i.d random sample drawn from f(x) and xn+1; xn+2?x2n a random sample of the same size n drawn from f0(x). The combined sample can be treated as a random sample from the mixture density (f(x) +  external  variables  perceived  usefulness  perceived ease  of use  Behavioural  intention  Actual system  use      f0(x))/2. If we assign Y = 1 to each sample point drawn from f(x) and Y = 0 to those drawn from f0(x), then p(x)=E(Y=x)=f(x)/(f(x)+f0(x)) can be estimated by supervised learning using the combined sample (x1, y1), (x2, y2), ? (x2n, y2n). The estimate ????? ?f p(x) is then used to estimate the unknown density f(x):  ?	??? ????? ????  ?????? (1)  This result is independent of the nature of the X-space (continuous, categorical or mixed). Furthermore, the reference density ????? is usually dictated by the properties of the data that need to be learned and the choice of supervised learning algorithms to learn f(x) is driven by the learning objective.

D. Random Forests for classification  We used The Random Forest algorithm as a supervised learning algorithm to test the validity of the designed survey.

The Random Forest algorithm, developed by Breiman [13], uses an ensemble of trees to significantly improve the predictive accuracy of a single predictive tree [14]. Random Forests for classification is a classifier consisting of a collection of single trees grown each from a bootstrap sample of the same training data set. The overall prediction accuracy is determined by voting. Each tree in the forest is grown as follows:  ? For each tree, a bootstrap sample of the same size as the  training data is sampled from the original data. This  sample will be the training set for growing the tree.

? If there are m input variables, only r variables are selected  at random and tried at each node. r is usually noticeably  smaller than m, and is usually taken to be the square root  of m. A small r value guaranties a small correlation  between the trees in the Random Forest. That is, the trees  are very different from each other.

? There is no pruning; each tree is grown to the largest  extent possible. This guaranties a correct classification for  the training data by each tree.

? To classify a new data instance, it is put down each of the  trees in the forest and the class that most trees agree on is  assigned to the new data instance.

The Random Forest classifier is usually more accurate than Tree Structured Classifiers because the latter can lead to a local solution because a single tree is built in a greedy fashion especially that the splits obtained from the children nodes are highly dependent on how their parent node was split and this makes the tree evolve around strong effect.

E. Association Rules mining  We used association rules mining to test TAM model applied to mobile payments. Association rules mining allows for finding interesting rules from transactional databases [15].

An association rule is an expression of the form A? C, where A and C are disjoint subsets of the set of items. Here A is referred to as the set of antecedents and C as the set of  consequents. The importance of a rule is gauged by its support and confidence. The support of a rule is a measure of its importance in terms of the number of transactions and is defined as the fraction of all transactions where the set of antecedents A and the set of consequents C apply simultaneously. The confidence of a rule is defined as the fraction of transactions containing the set of antecedents A which also contain the set of consequents C. The higher the support and the confidence, the more important the rule is.

Minimum support and confidence thresholds are usually pre- specified before mining for association rules.



III. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY  In this section, we present our research model which we formulated based on TAM, then we give our approach to survey design, sampling and data collection and finally, we will explain our data analysis methodology.

A. Research model  According to TAM, the success of mobile payment in Morocco depends on the degree of its acceptability by end users, which in turn may depend on other factors such as ease of use of the new technology, its usefulness, transaction fees and risk perception:  ? The ease of use of the new technology factor means that  when an individual adopts this new technology, it is not  because it is new or because it constitutes a substitution for  another method but because they know how to use it and  because it makes their life less complex.

? The usefulness of the mobile payment service factor  suggests that when an individual uses his or her mobile for  their payment it is mainly because it is convenient, suitable  and time saving.

? The transaction fees infer that the adoption of the m-  payment technology has a cost advantage.

? Risk perception means that this technology gives a high  degree of security. In other words, people should feel  comfortable and be at ease while using it.

Therefore, we need to assess the relationship between the independent variables cited above and the dependent variable (adoption of mobile payment technology by end users). To this end, we conducted an empirical study to test the following four hypothesis:  H1: There will be a positive relationship between the ease of use and the adoption of mobile banking technology [16]; H2: There will be a positive relationship between usefulness and the adoption of mobile banking technology [16]; H3: The lower the fee, the higher the adoption of mobile banking technology; H4: The higher the risk, the lower the adoption of mobile banking technology;      B. Survey design, sampling and data collection  We conducted a survey to assess customer intentions to adopt mobile payment services in Morocco. The questionnaire was designed based on short, simple and straightforward closed questions. We adopted a five point Likert Scale based on five levels, to measure the degree of agreement or disagreement of the surveyed population concerning the different variables. The questions were adapted from previous research studies [17] on Technology Acceptance Model, mainly for the adoption of mobile payment technology, ease of use and usefulness constructs.

C. Data Analysis Methodology  In order to identify the factors that influence the intention towards the adoption of mobile payment in Morocco, we conducted a three-fold analysis of the collected survey data relying on data mining techniques.

The first stage is a descriptive analysis of the responses of our survey, which allowed us to get a first feel for the results of our survey.

The second stage consists of testing whether our questionnaire allows us to distinguish between our targeted population and the general population. This stage is initiated by first creating an artificial dataset [12, 18] from the originally collected data by randomly and independently permuting the value of each variable in the original dataset, this relies on the technique for transforming a density estimation problem into one of supervised function approximation explained above. The reason behind generating this artificial dataset is to create a contrast between both datasets in order to determine the relative importance of each of the questions (model variables). Then, we use the Random Forest [13] algorithm for classification to evaluate the usefulness of the questions in our survey (Based on the four variables in the research model) in discriminating between the original data (our population) and the artificial data (general population), in which case we can conclude that we asked the appropriate questions to evaluate the four independent variables in the research model. We used the resulting random Forest model to ranking variables according to their importance (discrimination power).

The third and last stage of analysis consists of extracting Association Rules [15] from the original data to validate our theoretical model and verify the stated hypotheses. In this stage, we seek association rules matching our hypotheses and whose support and confidence levels are high enough to give us confidence in our conclusions regarding the different hypothesis. A major advantage of stage 3 is that the resulting association rules will reveal the different relationships that exist between the independent variables on one side and the dependent variable on the other side.



IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  A. Descriptive results  Based on the results, of the 96 respondents, 51 (53%) of them showed interest to the adoption of mobile payment while 45 (47%) are not that interested by adopting this new  technology. The age group 25-45 (86.3% of respondents with the intention to use mobile payment) look always for innovative ideas and like trying new technologies. Male respondents showed more (55% vs. 45% for women) intention to adopt mobile payment in their life. Educated people (74.5%) are more attracted by new means of payment.

Respondents with have high revenues (56.9%) showed also interest in m-payments.

The results also indicated that 57.3% of the respondents find that mobile payment is useful in their day to day operations. Furthermore, 69.8% of the respondents think that mobile payment is easy to use,  almost all of them required a low transaction fee and 64.6% of them questionnaire believe that mobile payment is risky.

B. Research model testing and variable ranking  We fitted a Random fitted model to the augmented data set and the classification error is at about 3%., this means that in 97% of the cases, the survey questions allowed us to discriminate between the real(respondents data) and the artificial data created for this purpose.  We can conclude then that the survey questions have proven to be accurate and suitable to check the drivers that push potential users to adopt mobile payment technology in Morocco.

We used the results of the random Forest model to assess variable importance. This indicated that the variables related to transaction fees and ease of use, hold the first positions.

They are the ones that most influence future mobile payment adopters and affect their intention whether to use or not mobile payment in their transactions. This means that surveyed people are much more concerned about transaction fees and ease of use than the risks related to making mobile payment transactions.

C. Association Rules Mining  At this stage, we are going to test the four hypotheses resulting from our TAM based model. In other words, we are going to investigate the relationship between ease of use, usefulness, transaction fees and risk perception with the intention to use mobile payment. We set up a minimum support threshold of 13.5% (in order to be able to find rules with a maximum number of antecedents), and a minimum confidence threshold of 80%.

The analysis of the resulting rules indicates that ease of use, usefulness, risk perception and transaction fees drive people?s intention to adopt mobile payment. In other words, the four hypotheses cited above were validated thanks to association rules mining. In fact, association rules mining have also revealed that there is a correlation between ease of use and willingness to adopt, between usefulness and willingness to adopt, between risk perception and willingness to adopt and between transaction fees and willingness to adopt.

The rules have also showed that the most frequent variables are ease of use and risk perception, which means that even if people care about the usefulness of the technology and the transaction fees, ease of use and risk perception are more important to them.



V. CONCLUSION  This work reveals the factors that drive people?s intention to choose or not mobile payment technology for their day to day transactions. The four main drivers investigated in this work are ease of use, usefulness, risk perception and transaction fees.

We adopted TAM as a theoretical framework to test our  hypotheses and used a threefold data analysis methodology relying on modern data mining techniques including random forest applied to augmented data with artificial contrasts for survey validation and also association rules mining for multidimensional correlation analysis and hypothesis validation.

Empirical evidence indicates that indeed the factors considered in our hypotheses affect Moroccans? decision to adopt mobile payment 87.5% of the times. According to the results obtained, ease of use and risk perception are the leading drivers of people?s intention to use mobile payment.

This implies that the Moroccan market is ready to welcome such a service if it is well designed so that it is easy to use by all the population and if it is secure so that users are protected from fraud.

It should be noted however, that implementing mobile payment technology requires considerations of other aspects such as Infrastructure availability, the possibility for partnerships between banks and phone operators, the quality of the business model and the choice of the appropriate technology.
