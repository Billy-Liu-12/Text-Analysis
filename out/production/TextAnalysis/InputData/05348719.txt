Two Way Wireless Communication With Implanted Sensors and  Therapeutic Devices  Henry Higgins  Zarlink Semiconductor, Caldicot, UK  October 1 2009    What Is Happening? - How To Change?

Challenges  ? Two way data transfer  ? Wireless frequency  ? Power drain on battery - must run primary function  ? Space - very little    Radio Frequency (RF) Body Communication - MICS Band  Very low RF power at 403MHz, 25IJW  : Range 3m  World-wide approval    Zarlink ZL70101 rc ? Operates in MICS band (403MHz)  ? Sleep mode to reduce average current  ? Separate wake-up receiver  - 2.45GHz  - Low "on" current  - Very low average current with strobe (-250nA)  - Higher transmit power allowed (typically 100mW)  ? SPI interface to processor  ? 200, 400 or 800kb.s-1 data raw rate  ? Variable tuning capacitors  ?
