8175-8215 MHz MILSATCOM Band for the GOES-R PDU Signal and the 8025-8400 MHz Band for the SD

Abstract A system"12 in which both processed data uplink (PDU) and sensor data (SD) downlink coexist within the 8 GHz band is one of several alternatives being considered for the GOES-R frequency plan. The 8 GHz studies performed so far indicate that having both PDU and SD downlink within the 8175-8400 MHz band is achievable. In such a design, a number of issues must be addressed related to interference to and from other systems in the neighborhood of the GOES-R frequency bands. These issues are self- interference from SD downlink transmitter to PDU receivers on the satellite, hardware complexity such as filter design, and payload configuration, for example, use of a single antenna for both SD downlink and PDU receive on the satellite or two separate antennas. Among the interference issues, the important ones are PDU and SD downlink self- interference, SD downlink interference to the deep space network (DSN) at Goldstone, PDU to DISA, and DISA shipboard terminal interference to PDU. In this paper we give a brief overview of the GOES-R system, followed by a detailed discussion of the design issues. A reference design that satisfies the link performance, interference limits, and implementable hardware constraints is given in this paper.

The 8 GHz studies performed so far indicate that having both a PDU and an SD downlink within the 8175-8400 MHz band is achievable. A GOES-R system overview and a summary of 8 GHz interference scenarios are given in Figures 1 and 2, respectively. The issues of cross- and self-interference for links within GOES-R frequency bands will be assessed by carefully examining the GOES-R communication link components as described in the following sections of this paper.

2. REFERENCE DESIGN  The data rates achievable, data compression ratio (if used), choice of modulation and of forward error correction code type, and effective code rate are the basic considerations in the signal design. The high-power amplifier and RF filter designs for the payload form the basis of the tradeoff between the hardware complexity and the amount of self- interference and of interference to other systems. For the power amplifier, some of the design parameters are hardware type (solid-state or traveling wave tube), output power back-off from saturation, and predistortion linearization. A frequency plan for the PDU and SD in the 8 GHz band is shown in Figure 3.

Frequency Plan for GOES-R SD and PDU  In Figure 3, a guard band (G.B.) equal to 105.1 MHz is provided between the SD downlink and PDU to limit the self-interference. A guard band of 11.9 MHz between the SD and deep space network (DSN) downlinks provides about 13 dB of interference margin, as shown later in this section. Reference design parameters for the SD downlink and PDU are summarized in Table 1.

As can be seen from Table 1, there is a 7 dB margin for the SD downlink and a 1.6 dB margin for the PDU/GRB end- to-end link performance. Perhaps the margins could be smaller than those shown in Table 1 when degradation to the link from interference sources is taken into account.

Also, the minimum elevation angle for the GRB receiver is assumed to be 10 degrees; when the minimum elevation angle is dropped to 5 degrees the margin may turn negative.*  even with the single-antenna configuration the isolation required (-165 dB) between SD transmitter and PDU receiver can be met. In Table 2 the details of SD D/L to PDU self-interference calculations are given. As can be seen from this table, there are three significant components in the isolation between the SD downlink and PDU on the satellite. They are 1) circulator rejection of 25 dB, 2) decrease in spectral regrowth off band center frequency (35 dB), and 3) RF filter rejection (114 dB with a 7-pole Chebyshev filter).

For the reference design, the sensor data rate is 130 Mbps and a compression ratio of 1 (no onboard compression) is assumed. The modulation type is QPSK with a Turbo Product Code (TPC) having an effective code rate of 0.8761 for error correction. The pulse-shaping filter is a square root raised cosine filter with a pulse-shaping factor equal to 0.35.

For the PDU, the data rate is 23.36 Mbps; the compression ratio is 1 with 8-ary PSK modulation and an effective code rate of 0.8761. Again, the pulse-shaping factor is 0.35. For the reference design, a single antenna is used to simplify the payload configuration for launch. It is shown below that  Reference design is an internal Aerospace assessment and assumes reasonably conservative link parameter values. The preliminary results on link margin are not an indication of issues with the GRB link.

The spectral regrowth as a function of frequency offset is plotted in Figure 4 for 8PSK.

The biggest part of the isolation comes from the combined rejection of the SD RF filter (114 dB) and the modulation- based frequency offset spectral separation due largely to the guard band. A 7th-order Chebyshev filter is envisioned for  GOES-R use for which the frequency response is plotted in Figure 5.

The combined isolation is plotted in Figure 6. It should be pointed out that the Chebyshev filter response with the center frequency at 8351 MHz as shown in Figure 5 was redesigned to be at a center frequency of 8340.1 MHz, and this filter was used to obtain the combined isolation plot shown in Figure 6. The center frequency was moved to 8340.1 MHz to accommodate the -45 dB bandwidth (96 MHz for the SD signal). As can be seen from Figure 6,at a frequency equal to 8181 MHz, the combined attenuation is slightly more than -149 dB.

Combined Response Spectral Regrowth after Power Amplifier and RF Filter Output  Setting the maximum permissible interference from the SD downlink signal to the PDU received signal equal to 500 of the noise power, which results in a 0.2 dB degradation of Eb/No, the self-interference should be less than or equal to - 146.27 dBW. With a 50-watt SD transmitter, it was shown in Table 2 that the self-interference from the SD downlink is calculated as -159.73 dBW, thereby resulting in an interference margin of 13.46 dB.

The margins available for the SD interference to DSN at Goldstone at 8400 MHz based on both interference power spectral density (PSD) and interference power spectral flux density (PFD) requirements are shown in Table 3 to be close to 13 dB. The details of the calculations are given in Table 3. The ITU-R requirements for the frequency band 8400 to 8450 MHz are -220.9 dBW/Hz for the interference PSD and -255.1 dBW/m2/Hz for the interference PFD. Both of these limits are satisfied using the GOES-R reference design with about 13 dB of margin.

The interference margin for the WGS Shipboard U/L sidelobe to the uplink from GOES-R Wallops is 3 dB. This is based on the link analysis showing the interference to be 16.1 dB below the noise floor. Keeping the interference within 500 (-13 dB) of the noise floor means the interference has a margin of 3 dB before it exceeds the proposed limit. The overwater/overground propagation from a nearby DSCS terminal sidelobe into the Wallops antenna sidelobe estimate doesn't take into account water vapor ducting. This ducting occurs during the early morning after dew or rain over ground and more generally over water.

This ducting limits the vertical spreading of the transmitted energy from an Earth surface terminal and greatly reduces the path loss. The flat spreading loss is roughly the inverse distance of the path. This is in contrast to an inverse square distance otherwise. Such a ducted path will exhibit much lower path loss. As a result, a 20 dB edge taper on the Wallops antenna rather than the typical 10 dB edge taper may prove desirable if ducting after rain proves to be a problem.

CONCLUSIONS  A reference design for a system in which both the processed data uplink (PDU) and the sensor data (SD) downlink can coexist within the 8175-8400 MHz band is shown to be achievable with a single antenna using QPSK modulation for the SD downlink and 8PSK modulation for the PD uplink. The design described here uses a TPC for forward error correction coding to close the link with adequate margin. Self-interference from the SD downlink to the PDU on the GOES-R satellite is shown to be about 13 dB below the tolerable interference level.
