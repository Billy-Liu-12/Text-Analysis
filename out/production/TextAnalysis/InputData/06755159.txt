Key Terms WAN Optimization, WAN Optimization Techniques, WAN Optimization Appliance, Controllers, Devices, Solutions for Big data and Big data Analytics

I. INTRODUCTION   As per IDC report, 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are created every day and 90 percent of data in the world today has been created last two years alone...This shows the emergence of the era of big data, ?Third Era of Technology? where computers learn. Companies and Organizations are very much  interested in getting valuable insights and patterns from this big data, here comes a new branch of science called big data analytics. Hence all the layers of OSI model suffer as enormous amount of data is collected and transmitted. So naturally network performance gets reduced

II.   WAN OPTIMIZATION  A. What is WAN optimization? - Collection of techniques used for increasing/improving data- transfer efficiencies across wide area networks is called as WAN optimization.

The most common measures of TCP data-transfer efficiencies  (i.e., optimization) are  ? Throughput ? bandwidth requirements ? latency ? protocol optimization  and ? Congestion, as manifested in dropped  packets  B. Why WAN Optimization?

WAN Optimization plays a prominent role in improving the network performance. Extensive is the groundwork for worldwide communications, connecting distributed offices to the main organization, linking data and applications to employees, customers, and partners in universal locations, sharing of resources and information, and facilitating business-critical data to the transmitted across the network. By business organizations, optimized performance of these networks is considered as a top priority to effectively execute business functions over the Wide Area Network(WAN) or Internet.[4]

III.  WAN OPTIMIZATION TECHNOLOGIES/ TECHNIQUES  WAN Optimization approaches can speed up application performance, facilitate high availability, and significantly enhance throughput levels.[4]  2014 World Congress on Computing and Communication Technologies  DOI 10.1109/WCCCT.2014.72   2014 World Congress on Computing and Communication Technologies  DOI 10.1109/WCCCT.2014.72   2014 World Congress on Computing and Communication Technologies  DOI 10.1109/WCCCT.2014.72   2014 World Congress on Computing and Communication Technologies  DOI 10.1109/WCCCT.2014.72     A. Technology & Advantages Following are some of the key WAN Optimization techniques, which facilitate enterprises and organizations to establish and maintain a sound network to efficiently continue their business processes: [4]   ? De-duplication ? Compression ? Web Caching ? Wide Area File Services (WAFS) ? Forward Error Correction (FEC) ? Protocol Spoofing ? Traffic Shaping ? Equalizing / Load Balancing ? Simple rate Limiting   a) De-duplication - De-duplication (Intelligent  Compression) may be defined as the process of eliminating redundant data so as to reduce storage needs. It is also referred to as or Single-instance Storage or Capacity optimization.

b) Compression - Compression is the technique of reducing data size in order to save space or the time of transmission.

c) Latency Optimization - Network Performance - Bandwidth and latency are the major factors that determine network performance latency optimization should be inculcated in any plan to improve network performance  d) WAN Optimization Caching / Proxy - The proxy server is caching a response from a server and distributing it directly when it receives an identical subsequent request. A proxy server that passes responses and requests without modification are called gateway or tunneling proxy servers.

e) Forward Error Correction - Forward Error Correction is a method of controlling error in the transmission of data by sending redundant data to the receiver or destination on recognizing portions of the data that are effort free.

f) Protocol Spoofing - Protocol Spoofing is an essential part of data communications that helps to enhance performance.

g) Traffic Shaping - Traffic shaping is a form of rate limiting and is used for managing traffic on a network so that the output fits a desired traffic profile.

h) Equalizing / Load Balancing ? Servers - Managing large quantities of data, requests for information via the web is a continuing challenge all IT managers face on a day to day basis. This challenge will only grow as connectivity spreads to all parts of the globe  i) Simple Rate Limiting -Rate limiting is any technique or process that is used to control the rate at which network traffic is sent.

B.  A Technology for Video Surveillance Three Simple Ways to Optimize the  Bandwidth Management in Video Surveillance Although an organization?s IT infrastructure is typically built to handle large amounts of data, including that of video surveillance applications, many operators are not fully leveraging the functionalities of their investments to optimize bandwidth capacity.

IV. TOOLS TO IMPROVE APPLICATION PERFORMANCE (APM)  IT organizations are  in search for ways and means  to deal with delivery and performance of key applications on the network, and make sure reliability, security, and cost-efficiency. To handle these challenges, companies are progressively turning to application performance management solutions?tools and techniques. They are used for managing and monitoring applications across the wide area network.

Figure 1: The layers of application delivery functionality These tools may offer comprehensive, visual representations of accomplishments on the network. They offer the analysis needed to take     action and make informed decisions too.

Application performance management can help observe and manage the performance of the wide area network, and the business-critical applications that run over it, including Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP).



V.  WAN OPTIMIZATION APPLIANCES/  DEVICES Supporting in this task of enhancing network performance around the well spread WAN and Internet are WAN Optimization Appliances, related technology devices, WAN Optimization Controllers, and other such Optimization products.

Compression, Protocol Optimization, Caching, Boosting Efficiency of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), and enforcing Quality of Service (QoS) methods are the techniques used by these appliances and devices.

A. Benefits of WAN Optimization Appliances/ Devices  ? Advances the Transaction time between sites 90% or even more.

? Boost up  the usability experience for users.

? Occupies various techniques to reduce WAN  traffic across WAN circuits, compress Internet Protocol (IP) traffic that is transmitted over the network, and eliminate Congestion in the path.

? Quicker response time for applications and database/resources access, and high throughput are the result of the presence of WAN optimizers at both ends of WAN links which fine tunes the IP traffic.

B. WAN Optimization Controllers (WOCs)  They are committed devices that are normally used for enhancing the application response time.

They are deployed on a WAN link on either end. A WAN Optimization Controller is typically a Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) and is connected to WAN Routers on the Local Area Network (LAN) side. By purposefully deploying WOCs at data centers and remote locations application performance over WANs can be substantially improved. WOCs are focused on improving the response time of business-sensitive applications that are conducted across WAN links.[1] a) Complementing WAN optimization controller investment for Big data and bulk data transfer [17].

Due to their nature WAN optimization controllers (WOCs) cannot accelerate big data and bulk data transfers typically needed for remote  backup, disaster recovery, data migration, demanding business intelligence applications. In order to accelerate also those data intensive transfers dedicated file transfer acceleration (FTA) solutions can be deployed and thereby complement your WAN optimization strategy and leverage the overall investment.

A WAN optimization strategy that also addresses big data and bulk data transfers should comprise a mixture of standard WAN optimization controllers and dedicated file transfer acceleration solutions. It is crucial to identify the hot spots in this ecosystem and its corresponding processes and deploy carefully chosen FTA solutions accordingly to leverage the impact of the overall investment.

There are only a few vendors that provide FTA solutions, each with a different focus  b)  WAN optimization controller comparison: Evaluating vendors and products[18]  IT organizations have a growing interest in deploying WAN optimization controllers (WOCs) as a way to implement network and application optimization on branch office networks. One of the factors driving this interest in WAN optimization vendors and products is the fact that many organizations have taken applications out of branch offices and consolidated them in centralized data centers. This, combined with the fact that only a minority of employees now work at a headquarters site, means that the vast majority of employees now access applications over a relatively low-speed, high-latency WAN. In addition to low speed and high latency, the WAN also suffers from quality issues such as dropped packets or packets that are out of order.

The amount of application traffic that transits the WAN will only increase, as companies increase their use of Software as a Service and other forms of public and private cloud computing. This will lead then to have more interest in deploying  WAN optimization and acceleration. [23] WOCs benefit businesses by improving the performance of applications that run over the WAN and/or reducing WAN bandwidth expense These products improve performance by: ? Reducing the amount of data sent over the  WAN by implementing functionality such as caching and compression.

? Mitigating the impact of inefficient network protocols such as TCP.

? Protecting traffic that is delay sensitive and business critical (e.g., VoIP) from being affected by other traffic types through the implementation of mechanisms like quality of service (QoS) classification and traffic shaping.

? Implementing application-specific optimization to improve the performance of higher-level protocols and applications such as the Common Internet File System (CIFS) protocol, HTTP, Messaging Application Program Interface (MAPI) and SharePoint.

One way to segment the WAN optimization market is to analyze a WOC's ability to provide optimization between  1. Disparate data centers 2. Branch offices and a data center 3. Remote users and one or more data  centers c).
