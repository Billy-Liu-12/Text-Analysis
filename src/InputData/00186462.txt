An Epistemic Utility Based Set-Valued Multiple-Target Tracker

Abstract  The performance of a MTT (multiple target tracking) method should degrade gracefully as the conditions of the collection become less favorable t o  optimal oper- ation. B y  stressing the avoidance, rather than the explicit minimization, of error, we obtain a decision rule f o r  trajectory-data association that does not re- quire the resolution of all conflicting hypotheses when t h e  database does not contain suficient information t o do  so reliably.

1 Introduction We develop a multiple target trajectory-data associ- at.ion decision rule that  is expressed in terms of two probabilities: one governing the informational value of the association hypothesis, and one governing the sub- jective belief, or credal, probability of the association hypothesis [l]. We also define a criterion of serious possibility, and all trajectory-data associations that are seriously possible are retained; i t  is not necessary to resolve all conflicting hypotheses before processing more data.

We employ an set-valued estimator, rather than the conventional point-valued estimator, to  describe the evolution of the vehicle trajectory. The set-valued es- t.imator is based upon the set-valued Kalman filter [2], which computes a convex set of trajectories, all with equal claims t o  validity, given the observations.

2 Epistemic Utility Theory For an inquiry under investigation, suppose there are finitely many hypotheses that may be considered. Let U denote this set of possible answers and assume that exactly one element of U is correct, and that all ele- ments of U are consistent. U is said to be an ultimate partition, and a potential answer is the collection of hypotheses remaining after we have rejected all mem- bers of a subset of U .  Each element of a potential answer is said to  be a serious possibility.

Epistemic utility is composed of a convex combina- tion of two probability functions, one measuring the  importance of acquiring new information, the other measuring the importance of avoiding error. We define the utility of accepting g c U in the interest of avoid- ing error as ? T ( g ; t )  = 1 if t = t r u e ,  and ? T ( g ; t )  = 0 if t = f a l s e .  In addition to  the cost of error, we also ap- portion a unit of informational value to  each hypothe- sis hi E U by assigning to elements of U non-negative real values such that their sum is unity. If we enumer- ate U = { h l , h z , .  . .,}in}, and let M ( h j )  2 0 denote the value assigned to  h j ,  then Cy=, M ( h j )  = 1, and for any set g c U ,  we define m(g) = m ( h j )  as the informational value of rejecting g.

We may address the conflict that  exists between the goals of avoiding error and acquiring information by defining an epistemic utility functzon for acquir- ing error-free knowledge (that is, making a decision) as the convex combination u ( g ; t )  = a r ( g ; t )  + (1 - a ) ( l  - m ( g ) ) .  The quantity CY represents the relative importance attached to avoiding error versus acquir- ing new information. We must restrict 4 5 (Y 5 1 to ensure that no erroneous answer is preferred to  any correct answer. Since all utility functions that are re- lated by a positive linear transformation are equiva- lent, we may simplify this utility function by defining ua(g;C) = i u (g ;k ? )  - 9. The resulting utility func- tion for accepting g in the interest of both avoiding error and acquiring new knowledge is  where b = e is the coeficient of boldness and lies in the unit interval. The closer b is to unity, the less caution is exercised that  error will be introduced (in- creased boldness in accepting hypotheses); the closer b is to  zero, the lower the risk of error (decreased bold- ness).

We must also establish a probabilistic measure of belief for the hypotheses that are available. Credal probability is probability formed on the basis of sub- jective judgment, represents the likelihood that an op- tion is true, and is independent of any informational value or demand that might be associated with the option.

10.586393191 $01.000 1991 IEEE    For a given ultimate partition U ,  let q ( g )  denote the credal probability assignment to  any element g c U .

For g c U ,  the expected utility is  where EQ(.) is mathematical expectation. This ex- pected utility represents a tradeoff between the desire to acquire new knowledge and the desire to avoid er- ror. The choice of b establishes a threshold a t  which the demand for knowledge renders the risk of error worthwhile.

We may adopt any set of hypotheses in the Boolean algebra generated by the elements of the ultimate par- tition, U .  This expands our possibilities; we are not constrained to  select only the elementary hypotheses, h i ,  but may choose any subset of them. This decision philosophy may be summarized as follows: Levi's Rule of Epistemic Utility [3, page 531: Gzven a finite ultimate partition U ,  an information- determining probability function m defined over the Boolean algebra of elements of U ,  an expectation- delermining probability funciion q defined over the same algebra, and an index of boldness b ,  the agent should reject all and only those elements of h; E U salisfying q ( h i )  < bm(h i ) .

3 Multiple Target Tracking 3.1 Track Initialization We assume that each track is characterized by a linear st,ochastic dynamics model of the form  Xjt = Fjt-lxjt-1 + Gjt-1ujt-1, (2) where j = 1,2,. . . , '& and ujt-l - N(0, Qjt-1) (i.e., uit-1 is Gaussian with mean 0 and covariance matrix Q j t - l ) ;  there are '& active tracks a t  time t (;rt is un- laown). The number of tracks is allowed to  vary since tracks may be initiated or terminated a t  any time. We assume that all tracks lie in the same state space.

In the interest of brevity, we restrict attention to the outputs of a single sensor, and assume that this output may be characterized by a linear stochastic model of the form  where st is the number of observations vectors a t  time t and zit is an rit-dimensional random vector, and vit - N(0, R;t). Each observation vector, therefore, lies in an rit dimensional space corresponding to  the column space of Hit .  We assume that each such space is a subset of the state space (.it 5 n) .  We do not, however, require all observations to  lie in the same dimensional subspace of the state space, and we per- mit the dimensionality of these column spaces to be time-varying.

Before data  are collected, we characterize the target environment with one set-valued track defined by an  initial credal matrix K O ,  an initial centroid state go, and a prior covariance matrix no. The initial state- vector set is  where  Polo = no is a positive-definite matrix, and Solo = K o K T .  For sample times t = 1,2, . . ., we observe st observations 2, = {z,,, . . . , gsrt}. Let us suppose, at time t ,  that we have z-1 sets of predicted (from time t - 1)  random variables of the form  where  (4)  where Silt-l = [I<~,,_,] [f<ilt-l]T. with  dp-1 = Klg-lp-l ( 5 )  & = Ft-lf~i-llt-l,  (7) - p:lt-l - Ft-ip~-ll t- lF~l + Gt-1Qt-1GF-1(6)  for j = 1, . . . , z- 1 .  We shall use the same Ft , Gt , and Qt matrices for each track, thus it will not be necessary to index these matrices with their track identifications.

3.2 The Ultimate Partition At each time, t , there exist st observation sample vec- tors, {git}:Ll of the random variables  zit}^^,, and 3-1 predicted track sets, { & l t - l } ~ ~ - ~ .  We wish to make decisions regarding the association of each zit with each track set x:lt-l.

We must define an ultimate partition for each sam- ple vector, resulting in a set of st ultimate partitions of the form Vit = { h i t l , .  . . ,  l t i t 7 , - 1 ,  h i t 7 t } ,  i = 1 , . . . , s t l where  where 0 signifies the hypothesis that none of the track sets associate with the observation zi t .  We shall say that track set is associated with observation sample vector zit if we fail to reject the hypothesis hitj.

Each ultimate partition, Vit,  has the property that exactly one element is true, although each is logically possible.

3.3 Calculation of the m-Function The m-function measures the information-value of re- jecting an association. One such measure of rejecting the association of a predicted track set x:,t-l with an observation at is the distance between sample val- ues of the observation and and the track set; if the distance is small there is little value in rejecting the association (in other words, there is great value in ac- cepting it). For g E C R" and zit E Fit, we define the generalized distance between them as  We restrict attention only to  a seriously possible region for zi t ,  given by  where R;* = diag { P : ~ , .  . . , p:',:}. and B a given con- st,ant. Define  for all c whose projection onto the space spanned by the columns of Hit lies in Xit .  We shall denote this space by Z i t  = {g E 92" : 'Pitg E X i t } ,  where Pit is the projection operator onto the space spanned by the columns of Hit .

The function mit@) is a normalized distance be- tween zit and g E x:it-ll and is a measure of the information gained by rejecting the association of - z E x:lt-l and zi t .  Let E,  - be a ball with center at g E x:lt-l. The  information value of rejecting the association of &I+ with zit is  (10) where Pit&, is the projection of the ball B, onto the space spanned by the columns of Hit. The vector Pit3: is the projection of g onto the same column space.

For g E X{ll-l and z' E x:lt-l with 1: # g', let the diameter of the balls ?I, and ?& become arbitrar- ily small. Then the condition mil(&,) < nljt(&,) indicates that  the information value of accepting the association of 3: with lit is greater than the value of accepting the association of g' and zit.

3.4 Calculation of the g-Functions The credal probability, or q-function, is the probabil- ity that  a given track-data association is correct. This probability is characterized by the conditional distri- bution of the observation given the track. For each  j = 1 , . . . , 7;- 1, the set of predicted random vectors is given by  For each observation random vector zit we represent the corresponding set of filtered random vectors by  where Wit is the Kalman gain matrix given via the Kalman filter.

The probability distributions of {x E Xflt} are characterized by the family of posterior distributions {pytlt(f;g);g E obtained via Bayes rule. We shall restrict consideration to  the case where x E X:lt-l and zit are jointly normal, so the mean and variance associated with this conditional distribution are given by the Kalman filter. For each observation zit = sit, we calculate the filtered set-valued estimate according to  f o r j  = l;..,'Tt-l, with Wijt the Kalmangain defined  by wijt = P:l t - lHz [ H i t P : , t - l H z  +nit] . The  posterior densities assume the form (for g E  -1  The posterior density is  with x a function of 2 given by (16) .

3.5 The Association Likelihood Ratio  The decision rule may be formulated in terms of the information-determining probability density, mit(;c) (where g E ,Yilt-l), and the family of subjective be- lief, or credal, probability density functions functions, { ~ : ~ , ~ ( g ; g ) , g  E ~ ~ l t - l } .  We desire to apply Levi's rule of expected utility to  this problem.

let a- be a ball with center a t - z. Using (10) and (18), Levi's rule of expected utility indicates we may not reject the association of &- and zit if  Now let the radius of B, go to zero, and define the function  Test  For 3: E  qijt(B,-;g) L bmit(B,) .

(21)  If (21) holds for any g E we may not reject the association of ;c with zit;  consequently, we may not reject the association of the track set xilt-l with Lit.

Since  we have  e-:(H.fc - Zit)TW~*[P;;(]-1W.,t(1f . f4  - Z,t)  ( 2 x ) S  IP$l: (12) - -  Given the information-value determining probabil- ity density (9) and the credal probability density (22),  we may form the Association Likelihood Ratio Test (ALRT):  Let xi,t-l be a predicted track set, and let zit be a sample value of the observation vector z i t .  W e  shall say that K{,t-l and zit are associated with boldness b i fqi j t (3:)  2 b m i t ( g )  for some g E Z i t  n&lt-l. That is, there ezists 3: E Z i t  n x{,t-l such that  i n  which case, X:t obtained via (11) is a filtered track set. Ifx:,t-l n Z i t  = 8, then we deem zit and to be dissociated, and the set  &:it has no meaning and is discarded.

If x:lt-l survives the ALRT for zit,  then the likeli- hood that x{lt-l is associated with L~~ is greater than the information value gained by rejecting the associa- tion.

4 Example To illustrate the concept of the ALRT methodology, consider the case of tracking targets constrained to planar motion. Let g = [z, y, i, $IT denote the kine- matic state of a target in some convenient coordinate system ( n  = 4). The dynamics equation is  where At is the sample interval, and we have set G 5 I .  Possible target maneuvers are assumed to  be characterized by the process noise, ut ,  whose covari- ance is Q t .  We assume that angle-of-arrival data are available; further, we assume that the sensor is suffi- ciently far from the target that  the linearized model is adequate. For convenience we also assume that the co- ordinate system is resolved along the azimuth and el-  evation angles Hit = [ 1 ;  that is, rit 3 2 .

The  tracks move generally from left to right a t  time increases; the lines correspond to the z and y position components and the + symbols correspond to noise-corrupted observations. Figure l (b)  displays the filtered track sets corresponding to  this simula- tion, with the ellipses representing the projections of the track sets onto position space. The initial pre- dicted track set Xol.-l includes the entire field of view, and is not shown. The three large elliptical regions correspond to the the filtered track sets after the first set of observations have been processed. As time in- creases, the size of these track sets decreases rapidly; for the first few observations corresponding to Tracks 1 arid 3, however, there are multiple associations, since tlhe tracks are fairly close and the track sets are still fairly large. As more confidence is obtained in the as- sociations, these tracks become uniquely associated, and the elliptical regions decrease rapidly in size, and will asymptotically become point tracks. At sample ten, Tracks 1 and 2 nearly intersect, and both tracks associate with the observations. These multiple asso- ciations persist for a few samples, but as the tracks diverge, the associations again become unique. Track 2 is unambiguously associated and estimated, as ev- idenced by the radius of the track set converging to zero, and the set-valued estimates asymptotically be- come point-valued.
