Abstract A number of lossless representations of frequent patterns were proposed in recent years. The representation that consists of all frequent closed itemsets and the representations based on generalized disjunction-free patterns or on non-derivable itemsets are proven the most concise ones. Experiments show further that the latter ones are by a few orders of magnitude more concise (and determinable) than the former one. As follows from experiments, the representations based on generalized disjunction-free patterns are also more concise than the available in the literature representations of frequent patterns, which determine supports of patterns in an approximate way. In this paper, we provide an upper bound on the length of generalized disjunction-free patterns. The bound determines the maximum number of scans of the database carried out by Apriori-like algorithms discovering the representations based on generalized disjunction-free patterns.

1. Introduction Frequent patterns are often used for the discovery of several types of knowledge such as association rules, episode rules, sequential patterns, and clusters [10]. As the number of frequent itemsets is usually large, it is important to apply concise, preferably lossless, representations of frequent itemsets. By lossless we mean a representation that allows derivation and support determination of all frequent itemsets without accessing the database. A number of lossless representations of frequent patterns have been proposed. Frequent closed itemsets (CR) were introduced in [26], the generators representation (GR) was introduced in [13]. Other lossless representations are based on disjunction-free sets (DFSR) [6], disjunction-free generators (DFGR) [13], generalized disjunction-free generators (GDFGR) [21], generalized disjunction-free sets (GDFSR) [17], non- derivable itemsets (NDR) [8] and their variations called k-free sets [7, 9]. All these representations, except for CR, consist of two major parts: a main component and a border. In practice, the conciseness of the CR and GR representations is of the same order of magnitude. The remaining border representations are by up to two orders of magnitude more concise than CR and by four than all frequent patterns [16]. In consequence, an intensive and promising research has started that examines the usage of such representations for speeding up the process of mining around frequent patterns and association rules in databases [5] or for reasoning from partial knowledge [14, 16, 18]. The methods of deriving all frequent patterns from respective representations were discussed in [6-8, 13, 16, 21, 24]. In [16, 22-23], a collection of algorithms for dataless transitioning among representations of frequent patterns has been offered. The pattern representations are used for efficient derivation of concise representations of other types of knowledge such as association rules [12, 15-16, 24-26, 28], episode rules [11], classifiers [3], and dependence rules [29].

It is worth noting that the generalized disjunction free representations and k-disjunction-free representations, where k?2, are even by two orders of magnitude more concise than the approximate representations of frequent patterns, which were offered in [5, 27].

The characteristic feature of all lossless    The characteristic feature of all lossless representations of frequent patterns, except for CR, is that for any pattern X contained in the representation, all its subsets also belong to the representation. Thus, Apriori-like algorithms discover such representations within at most n+1 scans of the database, where n is the length of a longest representation element.

In this paper, we offer three methods of deriving an upper bound on the length of sets in such representations.

We prove that the upper bound on the length of a longest generalized disjunction-free set depends logarithmically on the number of records in the database. We make this Management (SSDBM?04) 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00 ? 2004 IEEE estimation more accurate by taking into account also constraints imposed on the sought representation or both the constraints and the information on previously found representation for the same data set.

The layout of the paper is as follows: Section 2 introduces the notions and properties of frequent itemsets, generalized disjunction-free sets and generalized disjunctive sets, as well as the representations based on them. In Section 3, we derive a basic formula for determining upper bound on the length of a longest generalized disjunction-free set. In Section 4, we refine this formula be applying the information on constraints imposed on the representation to be mined. In Section 5, we derive formula that additionally uses the information on the already found representation on which another (less restrictive) constraint has been imposed. Experimental evaluation is provided in Section 6. The related work is discussed in Section 7.

Section 8 concludes the results.

2. Basic notions and properties 2.1. Itemsets, frequent itemsets Let I = {i1, i2, ..., im}, I??, be a set of distinct literals, called items. In the case of a transactional database, a notion of an item corresponds to a sold product, while in the case of a relational database an item will be an (attribute, value) pair.

Any set of items is called an itemset. An itemset consisting of k items will be called a k-itemset.

Let D be a set of transactions (or tuples, respectively), where each transaction (tuple) T is a subset of I. (Without any loss of generality, we will restrict further considerations to transactional databases.) Support of an itemset X is denoted by sup(X) and defined as the number (or percentage) of transactions in D that contain X.

The itemset X is called frequent if its support is greater than some user-defined threshold minSup, where minSup ? [0, |D|]. The set of all frequent itemsets will be denoted by F: F = {X ? I| sup(X) &gt; minSup}.

Property 2.1.1 [1].

a) Let X,Y?I. If X?Y, then sup(X) ? sup(Y).

b) If X?F, then ?Y?X, Y?F.

c) If X?F, then ?Y?X, Y?F.

2.2. Generalized disjunctive sets and generalized disjunction-free sets  In this section, we recall the notion of generalized disjunctive sets and generalized disjunction-free sets [16, 21]. Informally speaking, generalized disjunctive sets allow reasoning about supports of their supersets. To the contrary, the supports of generalized disjunction-free sets are not derivable. The key concept in definition of both types of sets is the notion of a generalized disjunctive rule.

Let Z?I. X?a1? ... ?an is defined a generalized disjunctive rule based on Z (and Z is the base of X?a1? ... ?an) if    X?a1? ... ?an) if X ? Z and {a1, ..., an} = Z\X.

Support of X?a1? ... ?an, is denoted by sup(X?a1? ... ?an) and is defined as the number of transactions in D in which X occurs together with a1 or a2, or ... or  an. Please note that sup(X?a) = sup(X?{a}).

Let err(X?\/a1? ... ?an) denote the number of transactions containing X that do not contain any item in {a1, ..., an}; that is: err(X?a1? ... ?an) = sup(X) ? sup(X?a1? ... ?an).

X?a1? ... ?an is defined a certain rule if err(X?a1? ... ?an) = 0.

Thus X ? a1? ... ?an is certain if each transaction containing X contains also a1 or a2, or ... or an.

An itemset X is defined as a generalized disjunctive set if there is a certain generalized disjunctive rule based on X; that is, if ?a1, ..., an?X such that X\{a1, ..., an}?a1? ... ?an, where n ? 1, is a certain rule.

Otherwise, itemset X is defined a generalized disjunction-free set.

The set of all generalized disjunction-free sets will be denoted by GDFree, that is: GDFree = {X?I| ??a1, ..., an?X err(X\{a1, ..., an}?a1? ... ?an) = 0, n ? 1}.

Example 2.2.1. Let us consider the database D from Table 1. Table 2 presents all generalized disjunctive rules based on {ab}. None of them is certain. Hence, {ab} is generalized disjunction-free. Table 3 presents all generalized disjunctive rules based on {abc}, three of which are certain. Thus, {abc} is generalized disjunctive.

? Management (SSDBM?04) 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00 ? 2004 IEEE Table 1. Sample database D Id Transaction T1 {abce} T2 {abcef} T3 {abceh} T4 {abe} T5 {aceh} T6 {bce} T7 {h} Table 2. Generalized disjunctive rules based on Z = {ab} r: X?a1? ... ?an sup(X) sup(r) err(r) certain?

{a}?b 5 4 1 no {b}?a 5 4 1 no ??a?b 7 6 1 no Table 3. Generalized disjunctive rules based on Z = {abc} r: X?a1? ... ?an sup(X) sup(r) err(r) certain?

{ab}?c 4 3 1 no {ac}?b 4 3 1 no {bc}?a 4 3 1 no  {a}?b?c 5 5 0 yes {b}?a?c 5 5 0 yes {c}?a?b 5 5 0 yes ??a?b?c 7 6 1 no Of course, if X always occurs with items a1 or ... or an, then each superset of X also occurs with a1 or ... or an.

Property 2.2.1 [16, 21]. If X?a1? ... ?an is certain, then ?Z?X Z?a1? ... ?an is certain.

The next property is an immediate consequence of Property 2.2.1 and states that supersets of a generalized disjunctive set are also generalized disjunctive. In consequence, all subsets of a generalized disjunction-free sets are also generalized disjunction-free.

Property 2.2.2 [16, 21]. Let X?I.

a) If X?GDFree, then ?Y?X Y?GDFree.

b) If X?GDFree, then ?Y?X Y?GDFree.

b) If X?GDFree, then ?Y?X Y?GDFree.

It was proved in [16, 20] that each certain generalized disjunctive rule determines an errorless method of calculating the support of the base of that rule from the supports of proper subsets of this base. In addition, it was shown there that the information on the support of a generalized disjunctive set and the supports of all its proper subsets is sufficient to reconstruct all certain generalized disjunctive rules based on it. In the result, the information on the supports of all generalized disjunction-free sets and the supports of all minimal generalized disjunctive sets is sufficient to derive the supports of all other itemsets in 2I.

2.3. Representations of frequent patterns based on generalized disjunction-free sets Generalized disjunction-free sets is a key concept for lossless GDFGR [16, 21] and GDFSR [17] representations of frequent patterns. One can distinguish two components in such representations: ? the main component consisting of all generalized disjunction-free sets that are frequent (denoted by FGDFree; that is FGDFree = F ? GDFree), ? the border consisting of minimal generalized disjunctive sets and/or minimal infrequent itemsets.

The complete border of FGDFree (denoted by Bd?) is defined as the itemsets not present in FGDFree whose all proper subsets belong to FGDFree; that is, Bd? = {X?I| X?FGDFree and (?Y?X Y?FGDFree)}.

Thus the complete border consists of either frequent generalized disjunctive sets or infrequent itemsets.

For the sake of simplicity of the presentation, in this paper we will discuss GDFSR, which is a ?canonical? form of a generalized disjunction-free representation, and stores the information on all itemsets in FGDFree and all itemsets in Bd?. Other representations based on generalized disjunction-free sets, such as GDFGR, are particular subsets of the canonical representation. Please, see [7, 9, 17, 19] for lossless methods allowing considerable reduction of the border size. A simple method of lossless reduction of the main component has been recently proposed in [20].

It has been proved in [20] that each itemset in 2I that is not present in the canonical representation has a subset in the complete border.

Lemma 2.3.1 [20].

2I \ (FGDFree ? Bd?) = {X?I| ?Y?X (Y?Bd?)}.

Thus, if an itemset not present in the canonical representation has an infrequent subset in the border, then it is found infrequent (by Property 2.2.1c).

Otherwise, it is a superset of some frequent generalized  disjunctive set. So its support is recursively determinable from its proper subsets (please see [16, 21] for details of deriving supports of itemsets from generalized disjunction-free representations).

Management (SSDBM?04) 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00 ? 2004 IEEE 3. Determining upper bound on the length of generalized disjunction-free itemsets without accessing database Since generalized disjunction-free sets are those itemsets the support of which cannot be derived (by means of generalized disjunctive rules), it is important to be able to predict what the maximal length of such an itemset is. If one knows that the length of a longest itemset is not greater than n, one will also know that Apriori-like algorithms will find all generalized disjunction-free sets after n scans of the database. One more scan of the database will be needed to identify also all minimal generalized disjunctive sets.

In this section we will derive estimation of the length    In this section we will derive estimation of the length of generalized disjunction-free sets with respect to the length of the database to be mined. Our estimation does not require any evaluation of the database and is independent of the transactions? length.

We start with simple observation that the error of any generalized disjunctive rule is always a non-negative number and is not greater than the length of the database.

Let Y be an itemset such that Y = {y1, ..., yn}. In the latter of the paper, the disjunction y1? ... yn will be denoted by \/Y.

Property 3.1. Let X,Y be itemsets such that X?Y = ?

and Y ? ?.

err(X?\/Y) ? [0, |D|].

Proof: err(X?\/Y) = sup(X) ? sup(X?\/Y) ? 0.

err(X?\/Y) = sup(X) ? sup(X?\/Y) ? sup(X) ? |D|.

? Our purpose now is to derive the relationship between the errors of the following rules: X?\/Y, X?\/Y ? a, X?{a}?\/Y. To this end, we need to recall a simple property.

Property 3.2 [16, 21]. Let X,Y,{a} be itemsets such that X?Y = ?, Y ? ? and a?X?Y.

sup(X?\/Y ? a) = sup(X?\/Y) + sup(X?a) ?

sup(X?{a}?\/Y).

Lemma 3.1. Let X,Y,{a} be itemsets such that X?Y = ?, Y ? ? and a?X?Y.

sup(X?\/Y ? a) = sup(X?\/Y) + err(X?{a}?\/Y).

Proof: sup(X?\/Y ? a) = /* by Property 3.2 */ = [sup(X?\/Y)] + [sup(X?a) ? sup(X?{a}?\/Y)] = /* sup(X?a) = sup(X?{a}) */ [sup(X?\/Y] + [sup(X?{a} ? sup(X?{a}?\/Y)] = [sup(X?\/Y)] + [err(X?{a}?\/Y)].

? Theorem 3.1. Let X,Y,{a} be itemsets such that X?Y = ?, Y ? ? and a?X?Y.

err(X?\/Y) = err(X?\/Y ? a) + err(X?{a}?\/Y).

Proof: err(X?{a}?\/Y) = /* by Lemma 3.1 */ = [?sup(X?\/Y)] + [sup(X?\/Y ? a)] = [sup(X) ?

sup(X?\/Y)] ? [sup(X) ? sup(X?\/Y ? a)] = err(X?\/Y) ? err(X?\/Y ? a).

? Thus, we see that the sum of the errors of rules X?\/Y ? a and X?{a}?\/Y, which are based on X?Y?{a} equals the error of rule X?\/Y, which is based on the subset X?Y. The next two corollaries follow immediately from this observation and from the fact that rules? errors are non-negative integers.

Corollary 3.1. Let X,Y,{a} be itemsets such that X?Y = ?, Y ? ? and a?X?Y.

err(X?\/Y ? a), err(X?{a}?\/Y) ? err(X?\/Y).

Proof: By Theorem 3.1 and Property 3.1.

? Corollary 3.2. Let X,Y,{a} be itemsets such that X?Y = ?, Y ? ? and a?X?Y.

min(err(X?\/Y ? a), err(X?{a}?\/Y)) ?

?? ? err(X?\/Y)?.

Proof: By Theorem 3.1 and Property 3.1.

? Now we will derive the relationship between the value of the minimum error of generalized disjunctive rules having the same base and the length of that base.

Lemma 3.2. Let Z be an itemset such that |Z| ? 1.

min{err(Z\Y?\/Y)| ??Y?Z} ? ?|D| / 2|Z|?1?.

Proof (by induction w.r.t. the length of Z): Let |Z| = 1. Then, only one distinct generalized disjunctive rule based on Z can be created, namely:    disjunctive rule based on Z can be created, namely: ??\/Z. Hence, min{err(Z\Y?\/Y)| ??Y?Z} = Management (SSDBM?04) 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00 ? 2004 IEEE err(??\/Z), which by Property 3.1, is not greater than |D| = ?|D| / 2|Z|?1?.

Induction hypothesis: ?X?Z, min{err(X\Y?\/Y)| ??Y?X} ? ?|D| / 2|X|?1?.

Let |Z| &gt; 1. By induction hypothesis, there is X?Z, where |X| = |Z|?1, and ??Y?X, such that err(X\Y?\/Y) ?

?|D| / 2|X|?1?. Let X\Y?\/Y be such a rule and {a} = Z\X.

Then X\Y?\/Y ? a and (X\Y)?{a}?\/Y are rules based on Z (*). By Theorem 3.1, err(X\Y?\/Y ? a) + err((X\Y)?{a}?\/Y) = err(X\Y ?\/Y) ? ?|D| / 2|X|?1? (**).

By (**) and Corollary 3.2, min{err(X\Y?\/Y ? a), err((X\Y)?{a}?\/Y)} ? ?? ? |D| / 2|X|?1? = ?|D| / 2|X|? = /* |X| = |Z|?1 */ = ?|D| / 2|Z|?1? (***). By (*) and (***), min{err(Z\Y?\/Y)| ??Y?Z} ? ?|D| / 2|Z|?1?.

? Theorem 3.2. Let |D| ?1 and Z?GDFree.

|Z| ? ?log2|D|? + 1.

Proof: The theorem holds trivially for Z = ?. Let Z be a non- empty generalized disjunction-free set. Thus, min{err(Z\Y?\/Y)| ??Y?Z} ? 1 (*). By Lemma 3.2, however, min{err(Z\Y?\/Y)| ??Y?Z} ? ?|D| / 2|Z|?1?

(**). By (*) and (**), 1 ? ?|D| / 2|Z|?1?. Hence, |Z| ?

?log2|D|? + 1.

? Thus each generalized disjunction-free set is not longer than ?log2|D|? + 1 and minimal generalized disjunctive sets are not longer than ?log2|D|? + 2.

Example 3.1.  Let us consider database D from Table 1, which consists of 7 transactions. According to Theorem 3.2, the lengths of all generalized disjunction- free sets GDFree discovered in D will not be greater than ?log27? + 1 = 3. Please, see Table 4 for verification of this result.

Table 4. GDFree in D  k k-itemsets in GDFree 2 {ab}[4], {ac}[4], {ah}[2], {bc}[4], {ch}[2] , {fh}[0] 1 {a}[5], {b}[5], {c}[5], {e}[6], {f}[1], {h}[3] 0 ?[7] In Table 5 we place all minimal generalized disjunctive sets found in D. As expected, the length of a longest minimal generalized disjunctive set is not greater than ?log27? + 2 = 4.

Table 5. Minimal generalized disjunctive sets in D k minimal generalized disjunctive k-sets 3 {abc}[3], {ach}[2] 2 {ae}[5], {af}[1], {be}[5], {bf}[1], {bh}[1], {ce}[5], {cf}[1], {ef}[1], {eh}[2] ? 4. Determining upper bound on the length of elements of generalized disjunction-free representation In this section, we offer an estimation of the length of elements that occur in the canonical representation of frequent patterns; that is, frequent generalized disjunction-free sets, as well as, minimal frequent generalized disjunctive sets and minimal infrequent itemsets in this representation. Now we will take into account the value of the support threshold value.

We start with the observation that the error of any generalized disjunctive rule that is based on a frequent itemset is less than the length of the database decreased by the minSup threshold.

Lemma 4.1. Let Y ? ? and X?Y ? F.

err(X?\/Y) ? [0, |D| ? minSup).

Proof: By Property 3.1, err(X?\/Y) ? 0. Now, err(X?\/Y) =    By Property 3.1, err(X?\/Y) ? 0. Now, err(X?\/Y) = sup(X) ? sup(X?\/Y) ? /* sup(X?\/Y) ? sup(X?Y) */ sup(X) ? sup(X?Y) &lt; /* sup(X) ? |D|; sup(X?Y) &gt; minSup */ |D| ? minSup.

? This observation allows us to derive the modified relationship between the value of the minimum error of generalized disjunctive rules having the same frequent base and the length of that base.

Lemma 4.2. Let Z ? F and |Z| ? 1.

min{err(Z\Y?\/Y)| ??Y?Z} &lt; ?(|D| ? minSup) / 2|Z|?1?.

Proof: Analogous to Proof of Lemma 3.2. Follows from Lemma 4.1 (instead of Property 3.1), Theorem 3.1 and Corollary 3.2.

? Theorem 4.1. Let |D| ?1 and Z?FGDFree.

|Z| ? ?log2(|D| ? minSup)?.

Management (SSDBM?04) 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00 ? 2004 IEEE Proof: Analogous to Proof of Theorem 3.2. Follows from Lemma 4.2 (instead of Lema 3.2).

? Thus each frequent generalized disjunction-free set is not longer than ?log2(|D| ? minSup)?. Now we are ready to estimate the lengths of all elements in the canonical representation.

Corollary 4.1. Let |D| ?1.

a) ?Z?FGDFree, |Z| ? ?log2(|D| ? minSup)?.

b) ?Z?Bd?, |Z| ? ?log2(|D| ? minSup)? + 1.

Proof: Ad a) Each itemset Z in FGDFree is frequent  generalized disjunction-free, so by Theorem 4.1, |Z| ?

?log2(|D| ? minSup)?.

Ad b) All proper subsets of each itemset Z in the Bd? are frequent generalized disjunction-free. Thus, by Theorem 4.1, their lengths do not exceed ?log2(|D| ?

minSup)? (*). Let Z be an itemset in Bd? such that X?Z and |Z| = |X| + 1. By (*), |X| ? ?log2(|D| ? minSup)?.

Hence, |Z| ? ?log2(|D| ? minSup)? + 1.

? Therefore, the elements of the main component of the representation have lengths not greater than ?log2(|D| ?

minSup)?, whereas the border elements have lengths not greater than ?log2(|D| ? minSup)? + 1.

Example 4.1.  Let us consider database D from Table 1, which consists of 7 transactions. Tables 6-7 present elements of the main representation component and its border, respectively, obtained for minSup = 4. In accordance with Corollary 4.1, the lengths of elements in the main component are not greater than ?log2(7?4)? = 1, whereas the lengths of border elements are not greater than ?log2(7?4)? + 1 = 2.

Table 6. Main component for minSup = 4 k k-itemsets in FGDFree 1 {a}[5], {b}[5], {c}[5], {e}[6] 0 ?[7] Table 7. Bd? for minSup = 4 k k-itemsets in Bd? 2 frequent:    {ae}[5], {be}[5], {ce}[5] infrequent: {ab}[4], {ac}[4], {bc}[4] 1 frequent:                  ?

infrequent:       {f}[1], {h}[3] ? 5. Using known canonical representation to derive upper bound on the length of generalized disjunction-free sets In this section, we consider the case, when the    canonical representation has already been found for a given support threshold minSup and we wish to use this information to estimate the length of generalized disjunction-free sets that are not present in this representation, but would occur in the main component of the more restrictive representation mined for minSup? &lt; minSup. To be more precise, we will apply only the knowledge of the length of longest itemsets in the border of the known representation (FGDFree?Bd?) in order to estimate the length of missing generalized disjunction- free sets, which are infrequent in known representation, but become frequent in new representation (FGDFree??Bd??).

Lemma 5.1. Let X, Y be itemsets such that X?Y = ?, Y??, sup(X) ? minSup, and sup(X?Y) &gt; minSup?, where minSup? &lt; minSup.

err(X?\/Y) ? [0, minSup ? minSup?).

Proof: Let ??X?Z. By Property 3.1, err(X?\/Y) ? 0. Now, err(X?\/Y) = sup(X) ? sup(X?\/Y) ? /* sup(X?\/Y) ?

sup(X?Y) */ sup(X) ? sup(X?Y) &lt; /* sup(X) ? minSup; sup(X?Y) &gt; minSup? */ minSup ? minSup?.

? We will use Lemma 5.1 for deriving the relationship between the value of the minimum error of generalized disjunctive rules based on the same itemset that is infrequent w.r.t. minSup and is frequent w.r.t. minSup?, and the length of this itemset.

Lemma 5.2. Let X, Z be itemsets such that sup(X) ?

minSup and sup(Z) &gt; minSup?, where minSup? &lt; minSup.

Z?X? min{err(Z\Y?\/Y)| ??Y?Z} &lt; ?(minSup ? minSup?) / 2|Z\X|?1?.

Proof (by induction w.r.t. the length of Z): Let |Z\X| = 1. Then among all generalized disjunctive rules based on Z (that is, {Z\Y?\/Y)| ??Y?Z}), there is a rule having X as an antecedent (namely, X?\/Z\X).

Hence, min{err(Z\Y?\/Y)| ??Y?Z} ? err(X?\/Z\X), which by Lemma 5.1, is less than minSup ? minSup? = ?(minSup ? minSup?) / 2|Z\X|?1?.

Induction hypothesis: ?V?Z (V?X ?

min{err(V\Y?\/Y)| ??Y?V} &lt; ?(minSup ? minSup?) / 2|V\X|?1?).

Management (SSDBM?04) 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00 ? 2004 IEEE Let |Z\X| &gt; 1. By induction hypothesis, there is V?Z, where |V| = |Z|?1, and ??Y?V, such that err(V\Y?\/Y) &lt; (minSup ? minSup?) / 2|V\X|?1?. Let V\Y?\/Y be such a rule and {a} = Z\V. Then V\Y?\/Y ? a and (V\Y)?{a}?\/Y are rules based on Z (*). By Theorem 3.1, err(V\Y?\/Y ? a) + err((V\Y)?{a}?\/Y) = err(V\Y ?\/Y) &lt; ?(minSup ? minSup?) / 2|V\X|?1? (**). By (**) and Corollary 3.2, min{err(V\Y?\/Y ? a), err((V\Y)?{a}?\/Y)} &lt; ?? ? ?(minSup ? minSup?) / 2|V\X|?1?? ? ?(minSup ? minSup?) / 2|V\X|? = ?(minSup ? minSup?) / 2|V|?|X|? = /* |V| = |Z|?1 */ = ?(minSup ? minSup?) / 2|Z|?|X|?1? = ?(minSup ? minSup?) / 2|Z\X|?1? (***). By (*) and (***), min{err(Z\Y?\/Y)| ??Y?Z} &lt; ?(minSup ? minSup?) / 2|Z\X|?1?.

Theorem 5.1. Let X, Z be itemsets such that Z?GDFree, Z?X, sup(X) ? minSup, and sup(Z) &gt; minSup?, where minSup? &lt; minSup.

|Z| ? |X| + ?log2(minSup ? minSup?)?.

Proof: Since Z is a generalized disjunction-free set, min{err(Z\Y?\/Y)| ??Y?Z} ? 1 (*). By Lemma 5.2, however, min{err(Z\Y?\/Y)| ??Y?Z} &lt; ?(minSup ? minSup?) / 2|Z\X|?1? (**). By (*) and (**), 1 &lt; ?(minSup ? minSup?) / 2|Z|?|X|?1?. Hence, |Z| ? |X| +    ?(minSup ? minSup?) / 2|Z|?|X|?1?. Hence, |Z| ? |X| + ?log2(minSup ? minSup?)?.

Now, we will show that each generalized disjunctive set that is missing in the canonical representation has a subset in the border generalized disjunction-free sets.

Lemma 5.3.

?Z ? GDFree\(FGDFree?Bd?) ?X?Z (X?Bd??GDFree).

Proof: Let Z?GDFree\(FGDFree?Bd?). Since Z does not belong to (FGDFree?Bd?), then by Lemma 2.3.1, it has a subset, say X, in Bd?. As Z is generalized disjunction- free, then by Property 2.2.2b, X is also generalized disjunction-free.

Theorem 5.2. Let l be the length of a longest generalized disjunction-free set in Bd?, m - be the length of a longest itemset in Bd?, and minSup? &lt; minSup.

?Z?FGDFree?\(FGDFree?Bd?) (|Z| ?

m + ?log2(minSup ? minSup?)?).

Proof: Let Z?FGDFree?\(FGDFree?Bd?). By Lemma 5.3, there is X?Z such that X?Bd??GDFree. Let X be such an itemset. By definition of Bd?, each generalized disjunction-free set in the border is infrequent. Hence, sup(X) ? minSup. Since Z?FGDFree?, then sup(Z) &gt; minSup?. By Theorem 5.1, |Z| ? |X| + ?log2(minSup ?

minSup?)? ? l + ?log2(minSup ? minSup?)?.

Corollary 5.1. Let l be the length of a longest generalized disjunction-free set in Bd?, m ? be the length of a longest itemset in Bd?, k ? be the length of a longest itemset in FGDFree, and minSup? &lt; minSup.

Proof: By Theorem 5.2.

This means that after no more Management (SSDBM?04) 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00 ? 2004 IEEE than 16 + 1 scans of the gazelle data set we will obtain all information sufficient to derive the supports of all patterns without any additional accessing of this database. On the other hand, direct mining of frequent patterns would require 154 + 1 scans of this database.

The next table contains data related to the Mushroom data set. Here we provide the length estimation results derived from: a) either only |D| and minSup for the representation to be found, b) or from the support threshold for the representation to be found as well as the characteristics of the representation already calculated (its support threshold and the length of a longest generalized disjunction-free set in the border).

The former estimation is placed in the first column before the last one in Table 9 (and is calculated in accordance with Corollary 4.1a); the latter one is placed in the last column (and is calculated in accordance with Theorem 5.2). The former estimation method is more accurate than the latter one for very high threshold values; the latter one is better for very low threshold values. In particular, based on the characteristics of the canonical representation obtained for the support threshold 0,10%, one can determine that the length of a longest element in the main component of the representation calculated for minSup = 0,05% will not exceed 10 (8 + ?log2(0,1% - 0,05%)?8124?). The real length of such an itemset is even less (8). As follows from Table 9, all generalized disjunction-free sets with non-zero supports have no more than 10 items.

Such a situation may occur when  border elements in Bd??GDFree, which are infrequent in the representation determined for minSup = 80%, become frequent when lowering the support threshold to 70%.

7. Related work The most similar to the representations based on generalized disjunctive sets is the NDR representation, which consists of all frequent non-derivable itemsets [7, 8], and the representations based on ?-free sets [7, 9]. It was shown in [8], that for each non-empty itemset Z, one can derive the lower bound (l(Z)) and upper bound (u(Z)) on sup(Z) from the supports of proper subsets of Z and from the fact that sup(Z) ? 0.

Non-derivable itemsets are those for which u(Z) ? l(Z) &gt; 0. If u(Z) = l(Z), then Z is considered derivable as sup(Z) is known to be equal to its bounds. In addition, all supersets Y of a derivable itemset are also derivable and u(Y) = sup(Y) = l(Y). ?-free sets are defined as itemsets such that neither sup(Z) = u(Z) nor sup(Z) = l(Z).

It was proved in [7, 8] that u(Z) ? l(Z) ? 2 ? [u(Z?{a}) ? l(Z?{a})], where Z?I and a?I (for |Z| ? 1).

This important result was used in [7, 8] to determine the upper bound on the length of non-derivable itemsets, namely: non-derivable itemsets are not longer than ?log2|D|? + 1.

Hence, the bound on the length of non-derivable itemsets is identical to the bound on the length of generalized disjunction-free sets (please see, Theorem 3.2).

It has been proved in [7] that ?-free sets are a subset of non-derivable itemsets, so their length is also bounded by ?log2|D|? + 1.

There is a claim in [7, 9] that the generalized disjunction-free sets equal the ?-free sets. This claim, however, is not correct, which we will prove by the example beneath. Table 4 contains all generalized disjunction-free sets. Among them, there is {fh}, the support of which equals 0. The support bounds for {fh} are found as follows (please, see [7] for the details): ? sup({fh}) ? sup(f) + sup(h) ? sup(?) = 1 + 3 ? 7 = ?3 ? sup({fh}) ? sup(f) = 1 ? sup({fh}) ? sup(h) = 3 ? sup({fh}) ? 0 Management (SSDBM?04) 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00 ? 2004 IEEE Hence, l({fh}) = 0 and u({fh}) = 1. Since, l({fh}) = 0 = sup({fh}), then {fh}, which is generalized disjunction- free, is not a ?-free set.

Since the families of the generalized disjunction-free sets and ?-free sets may differ, finding the relationship between them or between the generalized disjunction-free sets and non-derivable itemsets remains a challenge.

8. Conclusions The representations based on generalized disjunction- free sets belong to the most concise ones among all lossless frequent patterns representations with borders. In    lossless frequent patterns representations with borders. In practice, they are also much more concise than representations based on closed itemsets and approximate representations. In this paper, we offered three methods of deriving an upper bound on the length of sets in such representations. We proved that the upper bound on the length of a longest generalized disjunction-free set depends logarithmically on the number of records in the database. The obtained result is of high importance as it  guarantees that any generalized disjunction-free set representation for all patterns (both frequent and infrequent) will be calculated within at most ?log2n? + 2 scans, where n is the number of records in the database, irrespectively how strong or weak correlations among items in the database are and irrespectively of the lengths of records and number of distinct items.

The modifications of the basic estimation take into account the support threshold of the representation to be found or, additionally, the information on the length of longest sets of the representation already calculated for a higher support threshold. Though these estimations are more accurate than the basic one, they are still quite rough. Further improvements of the quality of estimating the length of longest itemsets in generalized disjunction- free representations is subject to further research.
