An Efficient Method for Distribution System  Restoration Based on Fuzzy Data Mining

Abstract?This paper presents an efficient algorithm for distribution system restoration based on fuzzy data mining. The computation time can be decreased greatly by dividing the computation into two parts: one is the part of off-line calculation, in which by using the historical FTU measured records ,the selecting rules of optimal disconnection switches in all loops existed in distributed networks are calculated by fuzzy data mining. The other is the part of on-line calculation, in which just the tie switches are optimized by some optimization algorithms, and the corresponding optimal disconnection switches in each loop created by two or more closed tie switches can be estimated according to the selecting rules and the actual data measured by FTU. Simulation result indicates that the proposed method is of high calculation speed,it can guarantee the quality of solution at the same time.

I. INTRODUCTION With the development of electric power market in China  and whole society?s electrification, power grid construction has been strengthened gradually.The distribution systems? configuration is becoming more complex, when accident occurs, the probability of service interruption becomes bigger.

So it?s very important to study how to realize the service restoration correctly and rapidly in order to enhance the reliability of whole network?s power supply.Various methods have been proposed for the problem of distribution service restoration, some are heuristic algorithms and expert systems [1, 2], which are developed for quickly determining restoration plans. But the drawback of these two algorithms is that it?s hardly to guarantee the quality of solution. In order to obtain the global optimal solution, many service restoration methods adopt optimization algorithm based on artificial intelligence, such as GA [3], ACO [4] and TS [5, 6]. But most of these algorithms code tie-switches and disconnection switches at the same time to optimize, and this coding method results in the algorithm with very slow computation speed because there are so many disconnection switches in distributed networks.

In this paper,an efficient restoration algorithm based on fuzzy data mining is presented.At the early stage of service restoration, the network can be simplified by equivalent load model [7] to improve the computation speed. We know that in the simplified network, the optimal disconnection switches of  each loop created by closed tie- switches are related with node power and branch impedance directly which are related with the power and voltage measured by FTU at the same time according to equivalent load model. In distribution automation system, the historical records of FTU can be easily obtained and using these records, the optimal disconnection switches of each loop can be calculated off-line. From the calculation results, if we can conclude the selecting rules of optimal disconnection switches, and in the process of on-line calculation, we just need to optimize tie-switches, the optimal disconnection switches of each loop created by the closed tie- switches can be estimated according to the selecting rules as well as the data measured by FTU. In this way, the computation efficiency can be improved greatly. Obtaining useful knowledge from magnanimity data is just the research domain of data mining.



II. FUZZY DATA MINIG Association rules mining has been widely used, such as  Apriori algorithm [8], but it is just fit for bool-type data, and the FTU measured data is numerical-type. In order to quantify the association rules, and  avoid the sharp boundary problem, an algorithm are adopted which proceeds fuzzy clustering firstly, and then carries out association rules mining.

A  Fuzzy C-Meam Clustering Algorithm Fuzzy C-Mean clustering algorithm is presented by Dunn  in 1973, and it has solved the sharp boundary problem which exits in conventional clustering algorithm. Consider a finite set },,,{ 21 NxxxX = ,  P j Rx ? , where N is the number  of patterns and p is the dimension of pattern vectors. The objective function of FCM algorithm is an optimization function that calculates the weighted within-group sum of squared errors as follows:  ( ) ( )?? = =  ?= C  i  N  j  t ij  m ijm xWUJ  1 1  ),( ??

The FCM algorithm focuses on mining mJ , subject to  the following constraints on U: ]1,0[?ij? , Ci ,,2,1= , Nj ,,2,1=                   (2)  ? =  = C  i ij  1? , Nj ,,2,1=                                   (3)  ? =  << N  j ij N   0 ? , Ci ,,2,1=                              (4)  Formula (1) describes a constrained optimization problem, which can be converted to an unconstrained optimization problem by using the Lagrange multiplier technique.

Then, it iterates the two updating functions (5) and (6) at the tth iteration until the cluster centers are stable or the objective function in (1) converges to a local minimum.

Let?s divide the attribute kx ( )mk ??1  into several fuzzy sets:  },,,{ 21 kpkkk xxxx =  ( )mp ?<0 , and the membership grade function is },,,{  21 kpkkk xxxx fffF = ,  for any subset X ? of  attribute set X, where },,,{  21 21 mmhhh xxxX =? ; ],0(,,, 21 phhh m ? .

the support )(XSup ? can be defined as:  ( ) nxtXSup n i  m  j jhi j??  = =  =? 1 1  )(  Where n is the number of transaction records,  and ( ) jjhi  xt is the membership grade of the ith record it  at the attribute  jjh x . For the minimal support given by consumer  min_sup, if )(XSup ? > min_sup, then X ? is called frequent- k-Item set.For another attribute set },,,{ 21 qyyyY = , which meets the constraint as ?=?

III. PROPOSED ALGORITHM The proposed restoration algorithm can be divided into two  parts: the off-line and the on-line calculation part.

A.  The Off-line Calculation Task of this part is to calculate the selecting rules of  optimal disconnection switches in all loops existed in distributed network by fuzzy data mining according to the historical FTU measured records, which is useful in the part of on-line calculation. Before acquiring the selecting rules, the optimal disconnection switches in each loop should be calculated first,which can be solved by distribution reconfiguration method. Here we adopt the quick branch- exchange algorithm [9].The off-line calculation has 3 steps:  Step1  calculate the optimal disconnection switches of each loop by equivalent load model and quick-branch exchange algorithm according to the FTU historical records;  Step2 deal with patterns composed by FTU records of each loop and the corresponding optimal disconnection switches using FCM algorithm, The membership function matrix U and the cluster center vector W can be calculated;  Step3 obtain a set of strong association rules by fuzzy association rules mining.

B.  The On-line Calculation When accident happens, after failure location and  isolation, the restoration strategy should be calculated on-line        as fast as possible. In this part, the optimal tie switches can be obtained by any optimization algorithm such as GA, TS and ACO, and the corresponding optimal disconnection switches of each loop created by two or more closed tie- switches can be estimated according to the selecting rules acquired in the part of off-line calculation and the FTU measured data. The optimal tie switches and disconnection switches compose the final restoration strategy.

Fig.3 chart of the proposed algorithm In Fig.3 ,the optimization algorithm adopted in the part of  on-line calculation is PSO, in which the particle is composed by tie-switches in the network, and every bit of it is denoted by 0 or 1, where 0 represents the switch opened, and 1 represents the switch closed.

C.   Explanation of Selecting FTU Measured Data  The FTU measured data can be easily acquired during nomal states.but some cases will appear during restoration: such as a part of load in the network is shed due to oversize outage domain, or because of fault isolation. In these two cases, the FTU data corresponding to the shed load can be set to zero, then deal with the patterns composed by FTU data by  using fuzzy association rules mining.The FCM algorithm focuses on mining mJ , subject to the following constraints on U:

IV. EXPERIMENT AND RESULT Take the certain country outskirts given in reference [4] as  an example, Fig.4 is the networks model  simplified  by the equivalent load model.

1)  FTU measured data construction In practice, the data measured by FTU can be obtained  from historical database. Here we adopt four kinds of daily load curves to meet the practice, where A is Da Za Yuan load, B is residential load, C is school load, and D is industry load, the measured meter of each kind is listed in table 1.

Assuming that the data given in reference [4] is the load in 12 o?clock, besides load 101~105 belongs to A, 116~145 belongs to B, 146~160 belongs to C, and 161~198 belongs to D. According to these load curves, flow of the whole network can be calculated, subsequently, the load power and node voltage of every FTU in 24 hours can be obtained. Now take the loop which starts from bus 22, passing several branches of feeder 22, and ends at bus 41 for an example to analyze.

Notation: the units of active and reactive power are MW and Mvar.

2)  optimal disconnection switch caculation Take the FTU data obtained in 1) , calculate the optimal  disconnection switches of each pattern The calculation results is as follows: 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, and 20.

3) Clustering patterns by FCM algorithm In distribution systems, when the structure of network is  unchangeable, every node voltage depends on the load in network, so we deal with the FTU power only by fuzzy clustering. At the same time, in order to decrease the amount of calculation, only parts of the FTU nodes are selected.Set the cluster number C=2, the membership function matrix U and the cluster center vector W can be calculated by FCM .

Let us select some representative rules to analyze. In order to strength the comparative effect, rules 1 and 4 are obtained through the decrease of min_sup and min_conf.

Analyze rules 1~4, we can conclude that:        a) When loads of feeder 22 are in high level, and loads of 22 and 41 are in low level, this situation corresponds to rule 1, though the support is only 2.30%, but the confidence is 100%. It can be declared that once this situation happens, the optimal disconnection switch must be 20;  b) When loads of feeder 22 are in low level, and loads of 22 and 41 are in high level, this situation corresponds to rule 3, the optimal disconnection switch will be 16 with that the support is 29.18%, and the confidence is 100%;  c) When loads of feeder 22, 23 and 41 are all in low level, this situation corresponds to rule 2, the optimal disconnection switch is 16 with that the support is 22.05%, and the confidence is 98.64%. Compared to rule 1, we can notice that regardless of the load level of feeder 23, once the  loads of feeder 22 and 41 are all in high level, the optimal disconnection switch is 16 in a rather large probability;  d) When loads of feeder 22, 23 and 41 are all in high level, this situation corresponds to rule 4. Compared to rule 2 and rule 3, the conclusion can be obtained that the probability of optimal disconnection switch be 16 not only depends on the load level of feeder 22 and 41, but also has large relation with load level of feeder 23.

5) The application of mining result In the process of on-line calculation, assuming that each  power of FTU on node 23, 26, 28, 20, 18, 16, 41, 40 and 15 are 1.5923+1.1018i, 0.7070+0.4760i, 0.3235+0.2124i, 1.1296+0.7671i, 0.1480+0.1050i, 0.5188+0.3526i, 1.4305+1.0056i, 1.0650+0.7340i, 0.1570+0.1137i. Following formula (2), the membership function matrix U calculated is:  ?? ?  ?? ?= 8568.08690.08502.08632.08565.09495.01292.01639.09608.0  1432.01310.01498.01368.01435.00505.08708.08361.00392.0U  According to maximum subordination principle, the belonging kinds of each power are as follows: 2, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 and 18. From the selecting rules, the optimal disconnection switch can be estimated as 16.This result justifies the precision of algorithm presented in this article.

In order to test the efficiency of this algorithm, take the distributed network like figure 3 for an example again.

Assuming that the fault happens on bus 22, first we apply  PSO to code tie-switches as well as disconnection switches, then adopt the algorithm presented in this article, the tie switch is also optimized by PSO. Each algorithm run  fifty times, the average computation times are shown in table 3.

V. CONCLUSION This paper presents an efficient method for distribution  service restoration based on fuzzy data mining. Bwcause only the tie switches needed to be optimized on-line,the on- line caculation amount can be decreased greatly.The optimal disconnection switches in each loop created by closed tie- switches is estimated according to the result of data mining and FTU measured data. A case study shows the proposed algorithm?s efficiency.
