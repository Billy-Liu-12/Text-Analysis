I.  INTRODUCTION  Recent technological advances have led to the production  of a big data, and consequently have led to many massive complex network models in  many domains  including science and engineering. The most well-known example is a webgraph, where nodes represent web pages and their relationships are hyperlinks. They are massive: the whole web consists of billions of nodes.

More familiar examples include social networks such as facebook network, twitter network, linked-in network, telephone call network, patent network, citation network and collaboration network. These networks  are very large  with tens of thousands of nodes .

Other examples are biological networks such as phylogenetic network, gene regulatory network, metabolic pathways, biochemical network and protein-protein interaction networks. In general, these networks have thousands of nodes and relationships between nodes are very complex.

In engineering, for example, large-scale software engineering deals with big  data sets of software modules and relationships between them.

Visualizat ion is an effective analysis tool for such networks. Good visualizat ion reveals the hidden structure of the networks and amplifies human understanding, thus leading to new insights, new find ings and predictions. However, constructing good visualization of such massive complex networks can be very challenging.

Many methods for visualizing large graphs have been suggested since 2000. These include fast multi-level fo rce directed methods, geometric  or combinatorial clustering methods, mult i-d imensional scaling (MDS), and spectral graph drawing methods. For details, see the recent proceedings of Graph Drawing or Informat ion Visualisation conferences (i.e ., [9]). However, current v isualization methods tend to exhibit one of the following problems:  ? Scalability: current methods for visualisation of large graphs can handle, at best, a few thousand nodes.

Most methods do not scale well, in terms of computational efficiency (i.e., runtime).

? Visual complexity: humans have limited ability in cognition and perception. A drawing of millions of nodes can be cluttered, making it  impossible to recognize patterns and inhibiting good insight on the data set.

? Domain complexity: Real world networks have special properties and constraints that must be represented visually. For example, bio logical networks have established layout conventions for specific networks. Thus the layout algorithms must faithfully represent these domain -dependent constraints. Similarly, in a social network, some nodes are more important than others , known as centrality measures [2].

In this paper, we present a framework for v isual analytics of massive complex networks. Visual analytics is the science of analytical reasoning facilitated by interactive visual interfaces [1]. Our framework is based on the tight integration of network analysis methods with visualization methods to address the scalability and complexity issues. See Section II for details.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we present case studies using various networks derived from the WoS (Web of Science). More specifically, we integrated co- citation analysis of Social Network community with 2.5D visualization methods to provide insight and overview on temporal dynamics. See Section III.A for details.

Furthermore, we derived collaboration networks and citation networks of Graph Drawing community and visualized using Anchored map techniques to understand collaboration patterns between important researchers  and to analyze highly cited papers and their relationships  in the community. See Section III.B for details.



II.  VISUAL ANALYTICS FRAMEWORK   In this Section, we present a framework for visual analytics of massive complex networks. Our framework is based on the tight integration of three components: Analysis, Visualization and Interaction. See Figure 1.

Figure 1.  Visual analytics framework  Analysis includes various methods such as filtering, clustering, basic graph algorithms and social network analysis methods [2] (such as centrality, k-core, block-modelling and structural equivalence). For details, see [2].

Visualization includes visual representations (such as matrix representation, map representation, and node-link diagram) and graph layouts (such as circular layout, spring algorithm, layered drawing, clustered graph drawing and MDS).

Interaction includes various methods such as zooming and panning, rotation and translation, animation and morphing.

Note that there is a repeated loop by a user (i.e., domain expert) in the exploratory process, to get an overview and/or details, and to find the right analysis methods and effective visualization methods. Therefore, interaction is necessary and  essential to enable such exploratory process. The whole process can be repeated until the user can generate a new hypothesis, confirm or reject the hypothesis, or get new insights, new findings, and new knowledge.

Based on the framework, we design and implement a research prototype visual analytic tool for large and complex networks, called  GEOMI (Geometry  for Maximum Insight).

For details, see [4,11].



III. CASE STUDY: WEB OF SCIENCE  A. Social Network Community   1)  Data Retrieval and Data Processing   In the search page of WoS, as shown in Figure 2, by using General Search with a query ?social AND network*? in company with the publication year from 1998 to 2006, we get the hits indicated in Table I.

We avoid to use ?social network*? in query, as it  will narrow the search results. For example, journal ?Social Networks? has 21 publications in 1998, however only 9 h its can be retrieved by using ?social network*? in query.

WoS allows us to save up to 500 records at a time. For search results which are more than 500, we save the records by parts on separate files. Then we concatenate all those files into a single file in the end.

Figure 2.  The search page of the WoS  Note that sometimes the same work was treated to have different ISI names. For example, records ?BURT RS, 1992, STRUCTURAL HOLES SOC? and ?BURT R, 1992, STRUCTURAL HOLES SOC? are treated  as different records.

Similarly, ?GIDDENS A, 1984, CONSTITUTION SOC OUT?     and ?GIDDENS A, 1984, CONSTITUTION SOC? are treated as different records. To improve the precision, we used short name. There are a few other kinds of errors involved in the files. We also manually remove the typical errors from the files to ensure consistency.

Once the query results are saved into files, we then convert these files into networks in Pajek?s format [3] by using a program called WoS2Pajek. We can get the following files : citation network (work:work), authorship network (work:author), keywords network (work:keyword), journal network (work:journal), partition of works by the publication year, vector number of pages etc.

TABLE I.  RECORD HITS BY SEARCHING SOCIAL AND NETWORK* IN COMPANY WITH THE PUBLICATION YEAR FROM 1998 TO 2006.

Publication year Record hits 1998 767 1999 744 2000 865 2001 903 2002 1006 2003 1248 2004 1322 2005 1556 2006 1835   2) GEOMI   We used GEOMI, a research prototype visual analytic tool  for large and complex networks; see [4, 11].

For analysis, GEOMI supports a number of analysis  methods such as centrality analysis, k-core analysis and clustering analysis  (such as k-means clustering).

For visualizat ion, it o ffers various visual representations including matrix representation, map  representation (such as treemap, sunburst, stream graph [16] and Voronoi map [16]), and node-link d iagram. It also provides various  graph layouts (such as tree layout [13], planar layout, circu lar layout, dendrogram, spring  algorithm [8], Sugiyama layout [12], 2.5D graph layout [14, 15], and clustered graph layout [13]).

For interaction, it supports zooming and panning, rotation and translation, 2.5D navigation [10] and head-gesture interaction [4].

3)  Temporal dynamics of Co-Citation Networks   Citation analysis can be used to explore the popularity and  impact of particu lar researchers, articles and publications. In particular, we use co-citation analysis method to understand the Social Network research community. Co-citation refers to the case that two works appear in the reference list of a third works simultaneously. Co-citation analysis was proposed as a variation on bibliographic coupling to measure the relatedness of works, by Small [5] and Marshakova [6]. Co-citation frequency is used to indicate the number of t imes two  works are cited together in succeeding literature.

From the previously obtained Pajek files, we derive a temporal network, a union of nine co-citation  networks of papers which were cited more than 15 times in  each year from  1998 to 2006.  We visualized the whole network using a 2.5D temporal network layout in GEOMI [15] to get an overview of the consecutive nine years (1998-2006). See Figure 3. To avoid complexity, intra-plane edges are hidden, and only inter- plane edges are shown.

Figure 3.   An overview of  temporal co-citation network.

Note that some papers were cited more than 15 t imes in consecutive nine years (1998-2006), such as ?GRANOVET(1973) 78:1360?. Some papers were cited more than 15 times in consecutive two years. For example ?SCOTT_J(1991)? and ?FREEMAN_L(1979)1:215? were cited more than 15 times in 1998 and 1999. See Figure 4.

Figure 4.  A detailed view of year 1998 and 1999.

Figure 5 shows the details of the co-citation network of year 1999, visualized with a spring layout [8] in GEOMI. The node size indicates the number of citations of a paper in that specific year. The edge thickness stands for the number of co- citations of any two papers in that specific year. From the node size, we can easily find the most cited papers in 1999 are:     ? ?GRANOVET(1973)78:1360? ? ?WASSERMA_S(1994):? ? ?BERKMAN_L(1979)109:186? ? ?COHEN_S(1985)98:310? ? ?GRANOVET_M(1985)91:481? ? ?BURT_R(1992):?.

From the edge thickness, we can identify two dense cliques: social network community (bigger g roup on the bottom) and physics community (s maller group). Note that the connection between these two communities is quite weak.

Figure 5.  Co-citation network of year 1999.

Figure 6 shows the co-citation network of year 2003. We can see that the co-citation network became b igger and more complex than the network of year 1999, while we can still observe the same two clusters. Note that the connection between two clusters still remains weak.

Figure 6.   The co-citation network of year 2003.

We identified that paper ?NEWMAN_M(2001)64? attracted more than 15 citations in 2003, while we zoomed into the right up corner of the Figure 6, as shown in Figure 7.

Then we fo llowed the links between inter-p lanes shown in  Figure 3. We found that his research has been getting more and more attention since then. For example, in year 2006 (co- citation network shown in Figure 8), Newman had three papers cited more than 15 times:  ? ?NEWMAN_M(2003)45:167? (64times) ? ?NEWMAN_M(2001)64:? (41 times), and ? ?NEWMAN_M(2001)98:404? (27 times).

Figure 7.   Zoom-in of the co-citation network of year 2003  In 2006, 97 papers were cited more than 15 times in total.

The top five most cited papers  are:  ? ? WASSERMA_S(1994):? (121 times) ? ?BURT_R(1992):? (105 times) ? ?GRANOVET(1973)78:1360? (99 times) ? ?PUTNAM_R(2000):? (91 times) ? ?WATTS_D(1998)393:440? (84 times).

Note that the network shown in Figure 8 is much b igger  and more complex than the networks shown in Figures 5 and 6. Interestingly, however, now we can observe that the two big clusters are more closely connected to each other.

4) Centrality Analysis   Previous pictures of co-citation networks support analysis on temporal dynamics and group analysis for each year. In order to examine indiv idual analysis  (i.e., identify highly influential papers inside each co-citation network), we used centrality analysis  to measure relative importance of a node in a network [2].

Figure 9 shows year 2001 co-citation network, v isualized using a 2.5D graph layout in GEOMI with node level constraints, defined by the degree centrality. The size of a node represents the centrality value. In this figure, the papers on the topmost level are more connected with other papers than the papers on the lower levels. Also, we can clearly see the relationship between important papers on the top level.

Figure 9.  Centrality analysis of year 2001 co-citation network    B. Graph Drawing  Community   1) Data Retrieval and Data Processing   In the same way as we did  for social networks, we retrieved paper records from WoS using keyword ?Graph Drawing?.

Based on the obtained raw data set, specific information of our interest was read into different tables in an Access database.

Information contained in the database include citation network (work:work), authorship network (work:author) and co-author network (author:author). After examin ing the information contained in the database by performing SQL queries, a few types of errors or misleading informat ion were identified. They are:  ? The same author was named d ifferently, for example: with or without middle names.

? The same paper was cited before and after published.

? The same paper was cited using different conference name or proceedings name, for example: Graph Drawing or LNCS.

These errors were removed manually from the raw data.

Therefore, the reading process was repeated several times to ensure that the obtained data was clean and information contained was consistent from record to record. The final data obtained include:  ? 753 papers between the year of 1966 and 2007, with 595 papers being co-authored  ? 960 authors, and ? 8720 papers cited as references .

From th is data set, we were interested in highly cited  papers and most active researchers in collaboration. Therefore, cross-table SQL queries were performed  to retrieve collaboration network and citation network. The collaboration network was formed by top 10 most active researchers who co-authored more than 40 times and their co-authors also co- authored at least 10 times. The citation network was formed by top 20 most cited papers and the papers which cited them.

2)  Anchored Map  The derived network was visualized with a tool, called  Anchored Maps [7]. An anchored map is a node-link diagram based on the spring embedder [8]. It fixes some nodes, called ?anchors? at predetermined positions and allows the others, called ?free nodes? to be arranged freely.

More specifically, an anchored map  was visualized using two steps:  (Step 1) Arrange anchors on the circumference at equal intervals. The ordering  of the anchors on the circumference is decided.

(Step 2) Fix the anchors and arrange the free nodes at positions appropriately expressing their relationships to the anchors by the spring embedder.

The number of edge crossings is strongly influenced by the  ordering of the anchors. Deciding the ordering is therefore the most crit ical problem. The tool offers five numeric indices as substitutes for the aesthetic criteria of graph drawing. For details, see [7].

Here, we used the eccentricity of free nodes as an index. It is the sum of distances between every free node and the center of the circumferences.

3)  Collaboraton Network   Collaboration network gives us information about how  often researchers write papers with others, and who often write papers together. The top 10 most active researchers in collaboration identified in our data set are listed in Table II.

In Table II, the times co-authored were defined as follows: if an author wrote a paper with four other authors, then the author co-authored four times, instead of one time. The co-     authors of these most active researchers were identified and if they co-authored more than 10 times, then they were selected to be the part of the collaboration network.

TABLE II.   MOST ACTIVE RESEARCHERS  Most Active Researchers Times Co-authored Liotta G 111  Di Battista G 80 Tamassia R 65 Mutzel P 62 Eades P 57  Wood DR 49 Didimo W 47  Nishizeki T  46 Junger M 45  Kobourov SG 44  Figures 10 and 11 show pictures produced by Anchored  Map. In Figure 10, b lue nodes (anchors) are most active researchers, while pink nodes are co-authors of the anchors. It can be seen that a few co-authors in the middle area (such as Goodrich) wrote papers with more than one anchor, while other co-authors on the periphery area wrote papers with one or two anchors exclusively (such as Rahman, Hong, Duncan).

Figure 10.   Collaboration network (most active researchers as anchors)  In Figure 11, where pink nodes are anchors, we can identify some cliques of co -authors for each active researcher. For example, we can identify German cliques  (Mutzel, Junger), Italian  cliques (Liotta, Tamassia, Didimo), a US clique (Kobourov) and a Japanese clique (Nishizeki).

4) Citation Network   Citation network gives us information about what papers are cited by other papers, and which papers are the most often cited. The top 22 most cited papers in our data set are listed in Table III.

We applied Anchored Map on the network, and the resulting visualizations are shown in Figures 12 and 13.

Figure 12.  Citation network (drawn with most cited papers as anchors)  In Figure 12, blue nodes are anchors representing most cited papers, while pink nodes are papers that cited the anchors. From this figure, it can be seen that there are many pink nodes in the middle area, which means that these papers cited more than one anchors. The closer to the center, the more anchors they cited. Therefore, we can identify core-periphery structure: center p ink nodes cite more than one anchor; periphery pink nodes cite only one or two anchors. In addition, we can find pink cliques that cite a similar set of anchors.

Figure 13.   Citation network (drawn with most cited papers as free nodes)  In Figure 13, the citation network was drawn with most cited papers as free nodes (blue nodes). When these papers are closer to the center of the picture, it means that they are cited by a wider range of pink papers. From this figure, it can be seen that some blue nodes are close to each other. This means that they were cited by a similar set of pink papers.



IV. CONCLUSION   In this paper, we present a framework for v isual analytics of massive complex networks. Our framework is based on the tight integration of analysis , visualization and interaction to address the scalability and complexity issues. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we present case studies using various networks derived from the WoS (Web of Science).

In the future, we would like to evaluate our framework with other big data sets such as Wikipedia, Facebook, or Twitter networks. In particular, we plan to integrate more analysis methods with various visualization methods  and interaction methods.
