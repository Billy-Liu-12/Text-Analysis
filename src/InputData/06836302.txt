Evolution of a Reconfigurable Processing Platform for a

Abstract The National Aeronautics and Space  Administration (NASA) / Harris Ka-Band Software Defined Radio (SDR) is the first, fully reprogram mabie space-qualified  SDR operating in the Ka-Band frequency range. Providing  exceptionally higher data communication rates than previously  possible, this SDR offers in-orbit reconfiguration, multi?  waveform operation, and fast deployment due to its highly  modular hardware and software architecture. Currently in  operation on the International Space Station (ISS), this new  paradigm of reconfigurable technology is enabling  experimenters to investigate navigation and networking in the  space environment.

The modular SDR and the NASA developed Space  Telecommunications Radio System (STRS) architecture  standard are the basis for Harris' reusable, digital signal  processing space platform trademarked as AppSTAR TM. As a  result, two new space radio products are a synthetic aperture  radar payload and an Automatic Detection Surveillance -  Broadcast (ADS-B) receiver. In addition, Harris is currently  developing many new products similar to the Ka-Band  software defined radio for other applications. For NASA's next  generation flight Ka-Band radio development, leveraging these  advancements could lead to a more robust and more capable  software defined radio.

The space environment has special considerations different  from terrestrial applications that must be considered for any  system operated in space. Each space mission has unique  requirements that can make these systems unique. These  unique requirements can make products that are expensive  and limited in reuse. Space systems put a premium on size,  weight and power. A key trade is the amount of  reconfigurability in a space system. The more reconfigurable  the hardware platform, the easier it is to adapt to the platform  to the next mission, and this reduces the amount of non?  recurring engineering costs. However, the more reconfigurable  platforms often use more spacecraft resources. Software has  similar considerations to hardware. Having an architecture  standard promotes reuse of software and firmware. Space  platforms have limited processor capability, which makes the  trade on the amount of amount of flexibility paramount.
