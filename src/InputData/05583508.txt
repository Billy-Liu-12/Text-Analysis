I.  INTRODUCTION The database contains massive information which can be  used for business decision and scientific judgment.

Constructing an accurate and efficient classification system from a large-scale database has been a key task for data mining and machine learning research. Previous researches mainly utilized the heuristic and greedy search technique as well as Decision tree induction, Bayesian classification and neural network, etc., to build a classification system [1-2].

These technologies usually derived a representative subset of the rules from a large amount of training data to build a suitable classification system.

Since association rule technique has gained much attention in data mining, how to build a classification system by means of association rules has been under research. Skikant and Agrawal [3] firstly introduced the concept of quantitative association rules. Liu et al. [4] proposed a classification method based on quantitative association rules (CBA), which used an iterative method to find the frequent and accurate possible rule set, to build the classification system by means of elicitation. But it introduces two problems. The first problem is that equi-width partitioning cannot cover the actual distribution of the data. The other problem is caused by the sharp boundary, where resulting intervals are meaningless and hard to explain. With the development of the fuzzy set theory, applying fuzzy set to deal with the partition boundary and the concept of fuzzy association rules are presented [5]. Fuzzy c- means algorithm (FCM) is introduced by Lu et al. [6] to  properly partition quantitative attributes into several fuzzy sets, and search technology of Apriori algorithm was further improved to discover the interesting fuzzy association rules, which led to the resultant fuzzy classification system (FCS).

With actual distribution of the data in a large database, however, it?s unsolvable to decide by FCM how many fuzzy sets of the quantitative attributes should be involved for partition.

In this paper, we propose a novel method to guarantee the accuracy and interpretability of a FCS. Firstly, competitive agglomeration algorithm (CA) proposed in [7] will be employed here to partition quantitative attributes into a set of optimized fuzzy sets. Secondly, genetic strategies are provided to optimize fuzzy rule base (RB) to the maximum extent.

Finally, the applicability and efficiency of the proposed method are verified by simulation applied to an existent diabetes dataset.

The remaining parts of this paper are organized as follows.

In the next section, A CA-based method for mining fuzzy association rules is introduced. Section 3 shows the framework of a FCS. Section 4 describes an improved genetic algorithm (GA) as a tool to optimize FCS. Simulation results are provided in Section 5 and Conclusions are given in Section 6.



II. A CA-BASED METHOD FOR MINING FUZZY ASSOCIATION RULES  A. Partition quantitative attributes by CA Let T = {t1,?,tn} be relational database, tj the j-th record in  T. Let I = {i1,?,im,im+1} be the attribute set, where i1,?,im denote related quantitative attribute and im+1 denotes corresponding categorical attribute. tj[ik] represents the value of the j-th record in attribute ik. Each record value in the form of quantitative attributes will be categorized into several optimized fuzzy sets by means of CA to mine corresponding fuzzy association rules.

Let X={x1 ? xn} be the record of quantitative attribute ik.

Using CA to partition data set X is summarized as follows.

The Competitive Agglomeration Algorithm [7]:     Fix the maximum number of clusters C = Cmax;  Initialize iteration counter k = 0;  Initialize the fuzzy C partition U(0);  Compute the initial cardinalities Ni for 1?i?C by using    (1 ) n  i ij j  N u i C =  = ? ?? .                           (1) Repeat  (CA-1) Compute d2(xj,vi) for 1?i?C,1?j?N;  (CA-2) Update ?(k) by using  (2) and (3);    2 2  1 1   1 1  ( ) ( , ) ( ) ( )  ( )  C n  ij j i i j  C n  ij i j  u d x v k k  u ? ? = =  = =  = ??  ? ? (2)  0( ) exp( / )k k? ? ?= ?                            (3) where ?0 is initial value and ? the time constant. (Here time is measured in iteration k). In our experiment, we choose ?(k) in iteration k according to  (2) and (3), with ?0=5 and ?=10.

(CA-3) Update the partition matrix U(k) by using FCM Biasij ij iju u u= +                               (4)  where      [1/ ( , )]  [1/ ( , )]  j iFCM ij c  j i i  d x v u  d x v =  = ?  (5)  and    ( ) ( ) ( , )  Bias ij i j  j i  ku N N d x v  ?= ? ?  (6)  In  (6), jN  ? is defined as:        [1/ ( , )]  [1/ ( , )]  C  j i i i  j C  j i i  d x v N N  d x v  =  =  = ?  ?  ?  (7)  (CA-4) Compute the cardinality Ni for 1?i?C by using  (1);  (CA-5) If (Ni<?), discard this cluster;  (CA-6) Update the number of clusters C and use the partition matrix U(k) to update the prototype parameters using  2 2 1 1  ( ) / ( )  (1 ) n n  i ij j ij j j  v u x u i C = =  = ? ?? ?                (8) (CA-7) k = k+1;  Until prototype parameters stabilize.

B. Representing Fuzzy Sets After each quantitative attribute is partitioned into several  optimized fuzzy sets by CA algorithm mentioned above, these fuzzy sets are usually represented as fuzzy variables for  classification. Membership functions for every fuzzy variable expressed in general triangular shape are described as follows.

Assume that the data sets X of quantitative attribute ik have been clustered by the CA algorithm, while partition matrix U and c centers vi for every cluster, where i?1,?,c and c denotes the number of cluster, have also been obtained. Let ?k(xi) be the grade of membership of xi in the fuzzy set with center vk.

All samples need to be classified according to the principle of maximum grade of membership, and find out the minimum grade of membership at both side of the center vk. Let the left sample with minimum grade of membership be xl, its grade of membership be ?k(xl), and let the right sample with minimum grade of membership be xr, its grade of membership be ?k(xr).

Therefore, triangular membership function f(x) for k-th fuzzy set can be described as:  ( )   k k  k k  x a a x v v a b xf x v x b b v  a x or x b  ? ? ? ?? ?? ? ?= < ?? ?? ?  <   >? ?  (9)  where ( )( ) 1 ( )  l l l k k  l k  x v x a x  x ?  ? ?  = ? ?  , ( )( ) 1 ( )  r r r k k  r k  x x v b x  x ?  ? ?  = + ?  .

C. Mining Fuzzy Association Rules In order to mine fuzzy association rules, a new database  should be firstly built through original database T. The new database takes the different partitioned fuzzy sets of every quantitative attribute as its attributes, which known as fuzzy attributes. Values of the record in fuzzy attributes are obtained as follows: Let ik(1) be a fuzzy set of attribute ik, then it is a fuzzy attribute. Value of j-th record in fuzzy attribute ik(1) is the grade of membership of tj[ik]. For a categorical attribute, all the possible values are mapped to a set of consecutive positive integers.

Let T be the new database, and I be the set of all fuzzy attributes in T, the value of the j-the record in fuzzy attribute yk is still denoted tj(yk). Obviously, the value of yk falls in [0,1].

Let X={y1,y2,...,yp}, Y={yp+1,...,yp+q}, X?Y=?. A fuzzy association rule is an implication of the form ?X=>Y?. Note that the fuzzy attribute of rule?s antecedent and consequent should not contain the same mark ik. The support and confidence of a fuzzy association rule can be defined as follows [5]:  The support of fuzzy association rule ?X=>Y? is defined as follows:  1 1 ( )  p qn  j m j m  t y FSup  n  +  = == ??   (10)    The confidence of fuzzy association rule ?X=>Y? is defined as follows:       1 1  1 ( ) pn  j m j m  FSup FConf  t y n = =  =  ??   (11)   where both in (10) and (11), n is the number of record in T, p and q being the number of rule?s antecedent and consequent respectively.

With above definition, we can directly modify Apriori algorithm [8] to mine the interesting fuzzy association rules with at least a minimum support and a minimum confidence respectively.



III. FCS FRAMEWORK CONSTRUCTING BASED ON FUZZY ASSOCIATION RULES  A fuzzy association rules based FCS consists of two principle components, fuzzy association class knowledge base and inference mechanism. The framework of FCS is shown in Fig. 1.

Figure 1. FCS framework  The RB of fuzzy association class knowledge base is derived by the means of algorithm described in section 2, which discover M interesting fuzzy class association rules as following:  1 1: ... , , 1, ..., .

k k  k m m jR If i is A and and i is A then y is C k M                =  where 1 ...

k k  mA A     are fuzzy sets of attribute, i1,i2,...,im, Cj are class labels. These rules have m+1 attributes, so they are the longest fuzzy association rules.

The fuzzy partition data base is composition of fuzzy sets represented with triangular fuzzy numbers as mentioned above.

Fuzzy inference mechanism is important when building a FCS. In this paper, we apply the inference method as proposed in [9]. When a sample x is to be classified, compute the discriminant function values of each class gi(x) (i=1,...,q), according to the following formula:  1 ,  1 1  ( ) ( )  ( )  i  m k j j  k M y C j i mM  k j j  k j  A x g x  A x  ? ? =  = =  = ? ?  ?? (12)  where ( )kj jA x  is the grade of membership of sample xj in  fuzzy set kjA .

Then, we take the class label corresponding to the maximum value as the classification result of the sample x.

The advantage of this inference mechanism is considering the information provided by each rule for sample classification.

For the easy understanding of fuzzy association rules, the FCS constructing has a better interpretability

IV. GENETIC OPTIMIZATION OF FCS Two main factors related to FCS are accuracy and  interpretability. It is unavoidable to mine some redundancy rules with the problem of minimum support and confidence setting, which will significantly influence FCS?s performance.

Thus, a genetic algorithm is utilized to optimize the FCS and achieve a trade-off between accuracy and interpretability. The whole process of the algorithm is described as follows.

A. Chromosome Encoding In this paper, we use a binary string denotes a group of  fuzzy rules, as Pittsburgh did in [10]. Let R = {r1,r2,...,rm}, ri is a fuzzy association rule, we can use a binary string C=(g1,...,gm) to encode the rule set R as follows.

1 2 3 1    ... ...

:  i m mR r r r r r r C  ?  1   1   0  ...  1  ...  0     1   where  1 , 0 ,  i i  i  if r R g  if r R ??= ? ??  .

B. Initial Populations According the encoding approach which is mentioned  above, we generate a set of chromosomes randomly as initial population, only note that the first individual should be represent the complete RB which are described above.

C. Fitness Evaluation To develop a good fuzzy rule sets from the initial  population, the genetic algorithm selects parent fuzzy rule sets with high fitness values for mating. Two important factors are used in evaluation derived fuzzy rule sets, the accuracy and interpretability.

This paper is given a normalized evaluation function according to the factors mentioned above, as shown in (13).

( ) ( ) / ( ( )f S E S N S ?= )                 (13) where, the E(S), N(S) is the accuracy and the number of the sub rules set S respectively, ? is a control parameter, representing a tradeoff between accuracy and interpretability. If the ? value is small, the fitness function then focuses on the classification accuracy. Contrarily, if the ? value is large, the fitness function is then dominated by the interpretability.

D. Genetic Operators In this paper, we employ the roulette wheel selection  combined with elitism policy to run this operation. What the ratio is chosen from the i-th individual of the population is shown as (14). Thus the superior individuals are reserved.

( )( ) ( )  n  j  FitnessValue iP i FitnessValue j  = ?   (14)    This paper employs two-point crossover and simple mutation scheme. Definite the two individuals Pi and Pj are:  1 2 1 1  1 2 1 1  ... ... ...

... ... ...

i k k l l m  j k k l l m  P P  ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?  ? ?  ? ?  = =  .

If the crossover operator begins at the k-th bit, and end at l- th bit, then the new offspring chromosomes is:  ' 1 2 1 1  ' 1 2 1 1  ... | ... | ...

... | ... | ...

i k k l l m  j k k l l m  P P  ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?  ? ?  ? ?  = =  .

If the mutation operator appears in the k-th bit of the individual Pi then:  _ '  1 2 1 1... ... ...ki k l l mP ? ? ? ? ? ? ?? ?= .

That is, if ?k the is zero, turns to one, and on the contrary, turns to zero. Different to the simple GA, we select fixed number of individuals to be crossed and fixed number of bits to be mutated where the individual and bit are selected from the population randomly.



V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed  approach, this paper selects diabetes dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository, which has 8 quantitative attribute, 1 categorical attribute and 768 cases. The goal of the experiments is to identify two possible classes, Positive or Negative, from a set of instance. Tab. I shows an actual case expressed in term of 8 features and one class  TABLE I.  A CASE FOR DIABETES DIAGNOSIS  Feature Feature Values  Times pregnant 3  2-hour plasma glucose concentration 113  Diastolic blood pressure 50  Triceps skin fold thickness 10  2-hour serum insulin 85  Body mass index 29.5  Diabetes pedigree function 0.626  Age 25  Class: Positive    The 768 cases are first divided into two groups, a training set and a test set. The training set is used to mine the fuzzy association rules and evaluate the fitness of rule sets during the evolution process. The test set act as input events to test the accuracy of the derived RB. In this experiment, 70% of the diabetes is selected at random for training, and the remaining 30% of the case are used for testing. Sampling is stratified by the class labels to ensure that the subset class proportions are roughly the same as those in the whole dataset. Using CA algorithm to partition 8 quantitative attributes, and the result of fuzzy sets are: 3, 4, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3. The minimum support is set to be 0.1%, the minimum confidence is set to be 50% and 920 longest fuzzy association rules are mined. Subsequently, GA is applied to optimize the FCS. The initial population size P is set at 20, the crossover rate pc is set at 0.6, and the mutation rate pm is set at 0.03.The parameter ? is set at 0.125. Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 show the results for different numbers of generations with respect to accuracy and rules number.

The accuracy of some other classification methods on the same diabetes classification problem is examined in [1], [4], and [6]. Table 2.

compares the accuracy of our proposed approach with that of the above classification methods. Obviously, the performance of optimized FCS is better than that of other methods.
