A High-Density, Non-Volatile Mass-Memory and Data Formatting Solution for Space Applications

Abstract?The Instrument Storage Module was designed to provide a single-board path from a satellite?s instruments to its transmitter. It is equipped with custom interfaces to the in- strument, CCSDS formatting algorithms implemented in an FPGA, mass-memory storage, and a direct X-Band or Ku- Band transmitter output interface. In order to pinpoint and eliminate any bottlenecks in maintaining a continuous 150 Mbps downlink rate, we have studied the bandwidth of in- dividual component blocks in the data flow and present the results in this article. Our analysis consists of FPGA simula- tion, FPGA timing design, and board layout timing analysis.
