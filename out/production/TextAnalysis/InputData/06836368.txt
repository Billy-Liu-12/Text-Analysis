Abstract? A Command and Data Handling (C&DH) system is being developed as part of a series of CubeSat missions being  built at the University of Texas at Austin Texas Spacecraft  Laboratory (TSL). With concurrent development of four  missions and with more missions planned for the future, the  C&DH team is developing a system architecture that can  support a variety of mission requirements. The presented  research aims to establish a reference for the development of  the C&DH system architecture so that it can be reused for  future university missions.

The C&DH system is designed using a centralized architecture  with one main flight computer controlling the actions and the  state of the satellite. A commercial off-the-shelf system-on-  module embedded computer running a Linux environment  hosted on an interface board designed in-house is used as the  platform for the mission software. An integral component of  the C&DH system development is the flight software (FSW).

The FSW is written in C++ using the Object-oriented  architectural style. It is structured as a state machine,  controlling the transitioning of the satellite between its  operational modes which define its actions and behaviour. The  various testing procedures that are performed on the FSW, the  C&DH system and the integrated satellite are described. These  procedures include traditional software tests such as black box,  glass box, and unit testing, as well as formal spacecraft tests  such as Command Execution Tests and Day-in-the-Life tests.

The design of the flight software and the associated hardware  are integral components of the current missions in the TSL  which, when flown, will be some of the most operationally  complex CubeSat missions attempted to date.
