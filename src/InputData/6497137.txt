These instruments have returned  roughly 1.5 Tbytes of solar data per day nearly continuously  since the beginning of SDO's science operations in May  2010, which has been facilitated by a continuous downlink  from geosynchronous orbit to SDO's dedicated pair of 18-m  antennas in White Sands, New Mexico. Science data  returned from SDO is continually advancing knowledge of  and research in prominence and filament eruptions, late  phase flares, and the solar vector magnetic field, amongst  other areas. Additionally, observations made during orbit  maintenance, collision avoidance, and ground system  operations have yielded lessons learned about the need to  account for extreme weather in antenna design and the  importance of clear, direct communication channels with  other satellite operators. These observations and lessons are  being used to improve the SDO ground system and  operations approach and may prove useful for future  mission design.
