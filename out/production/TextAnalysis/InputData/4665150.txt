Mining Temporal Information and Web-casting Text for Automatic Sports Event Detection

Abstract?In this paper, the generic framework for automat- ically detecting event based on Allen temporal algebra and external text information support is presented. The motivation of the proposed method is (1) to relax the need of domain knowledge that requires significant human interference; and (2) to take into account the temporal information that has been paid less attention though it is critical to convey event meaning.

In order to solve two these problems, in the proposed method, the temporal information is captured by presenting events as the temporal sequences using a lexicon of Allen-based non- ambiguous temporal patterns. These sequences are then used to mine temporal patterns with web-casting text supports by using technique of mining class association rules. Then, the results of previous steps are tailored to build the event detector.

Thorough experimental results and comparisons that are carried on more than 30 hours of soccer video corpus captured at different broadcasters and conditions demonstrates that the proposed method meets two aforementioned motivations with high efficiency, effectiveness, and robustness.



I. INTRODUCTION  Due to the semantic gap between low-level and high- level semantic features, many open problems related to event detection still exist. To narrow such a gap, most of the existing methods using supports from the domain knowl- edge. Unfortunately, since those methods relies heavily on the domain knowledge with significant human interference, it can be hardly applied as a generic framework for an arbitrary domain automatically [1], [2], [3], [4], to name but a few. Beside that, although temporal information is critical to convey event meaning, a few studies have been attempted for exploiting it in event detection. Allen[5] proposed the temporal algebra by which any temporal relation in reality can be modeled optimally based on thirteen basic relationships, however, very little attention has been paid to utilized Allen?s theory so far. Most of methods that pay attention in capturing temporal information focus on only linear temporal relations though such relations lack the ability to represent temporal information of real complex events compared with Allen?s.

The following part is a compact review for related methods those take into account the temporal information.

In [6] and [7] the authors capture the temporal information between a certain pair of states as a simple sequential relation (e.g. followed by) by building the Finte State Machine. Al- though using simple sequential patterns, a high-level concept that can not be detected and recognized from using solely  visual descriptors without temporal relation information could be detected with high accuracy.

In order to offer strong generality and extensibility with the capability of exploring representative event patterns with little human interference, Chen et al [8], [9] propose a method using an advanced temporal analysis, and multi-modal data mining method. The basic idea of this method is that a significant temporal pattern should be able to separate the event units as far away from the nonevent units as possible, while grouping the consecutive event units themselves as closely to each other as possible. Clearly, due to using sequential pattern this method has no ability to detect complex events in the case temporal patterns display at different sequential orders.

Zhu et al [10] propose the attractive method by which most of aforementioned problems are solved. The authors use multilevel sequential association mining to explore as- sociations among the audio and visual cues, classifies the associations by assigning each of them with a class label, and uses their appearances in the video to construct video indexes.

Unfortunately, since these tags are orderly sorted as ?followed by?, it is easy to see that the knowledge of temporal intervals is not maintained but simplified.

Snoek et al [11] utilize the Allen temporal algebra detect event in two different domain: sports and news. The triplex (TIME segmentation, TIME relations, TIME representation) is used to capture and model the temporal intervals. Unfortu- nately, by predefining the semantic rules for a set of limited events, this method is still inflexible and domain dependent.

These aforementioned methods have the common disad- vantage: due to totally depending on the knowledge of one specific domain and human interference, these models can not be deployed to detect events at other domains, or even other events in the same domain.

In [12], [13], the authors introduce the very interesting unsupervised method detect events based on Allen?s theory.
