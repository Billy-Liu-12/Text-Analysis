I.  INTRODUCTION In the distance learning platform, question-answering  system becomes an important part of online education, it plays an essential role in enhancing the exchange of teachers and distance learners, and helping distance learners access to the information they really need [1] [2]. In question-answering system, how to effectively optimize the processing of information has become a hot topic of current research.

As to data mining methods like the correlation analysis, this paper did the comprehensive analysis and research in theory and algorithms, dug out the hidden information classification behind the database by using data mining technology,  found the relationship between knowledge points and the questions that students frequently asked, dug out  the potential rules which user uses to sort the results in the process of browsing the results, and then generated the rule base and optimized the processing of information.  This built a strong guarantee for intelligent question-answering system.



II. IMPLEMENTATION OF MINING ASSOCIATION RULES The concept of association rules was raised by the  Agrawal, Imielnski, Swami. It is a hot topic in data mining and widely used in marketing, business analysis, financial  industry and other applications.  Association rule mining algorithm is the main content of research on mining association rules.  The task for discovering association rules is to find all the rules meeting pre-specified frequency and accuracy standard[3] [4].

A. Pre-mining resources Transaction data set is the data source that association  rule mining directly faces, and it has an important impact on the precision of mining results.  Therefore, while establishing transaction data set, we must preprocess the original data [5].

After the user raises the initial questions, the system will produce a series of relevant results and these results are calculated according to the derived weights of user?s questions.  When the user performs a selective review of some of the results (R1 ... Rn), each result (R1 ... Rn) is each transaction, but we can not blindly add all the transactions to the transaction data set, not only because of the huge number of these transactions, and little value of a considerable portion. Some screenings of these transactions are needed.

For example, in an interview process, a user only browses one or two results and ends the visit. In general, we think that the user has found a satisfactory answer and doesn?t need add this transaction to the transaction data set.  After the investigation, the user usually browses the results three to five times if the user has the questions in doubt, and these result sets are the last mining data set.

B. Association Rules Mining  Association rules are given a set of items (Item) and a record collection. By analyzing record collection, derive the correlation between Items.  In the system of association rules, the rule itself is a simple form like "If what condition is met, then what results or circumstances will be gotten".  It can be expressed as "X ?  Y" association rule, which consists of two parts: the left part of X is called antecedent and the right part of Y is called consequent.

2011 International Symposium on Computer Science and Society  DOI 10.1109/ISCCS.2011.86         Association rules can be described in mathematical formula [6]:  Let I = {i 1, i 2, ..., i m} is a collection composed of m different items (normally we also call I itemset).  Given a database D, each record T in the database D is one collection in I, namely T? I.  Let X be one set of items in I, if X?T, we say T contains X.  An association rule is an implication like the form X?Y, where X? I,Y? I, X? Y=? .

Association rules mining is a two-step process: 1.  Find all the frequent itemsets: By definition, the emergence frequency of these  itemsets is minimum, same as predefined minimum support value.

2. Strong association rules generated by frequent itemsets:  By definition, these rules must satisfy minimum support and minimum confidence.

The second step of these two steps is the easiest, so the overall performance of mining association rules is determined by the first step.  Generating all the frequent itemsets is the first step in mining association rules, and largely determines the overall efficiency of mining.

Determine whether it is the frequent itemset by calculating the minimum support of a variety of combinations of itemsets in the transaction database.

In the process of mining association rule at the first step, the most famous algorithm is the Apriori algorithm.



III. APRIORI ALGORITHM AND ITS APPLICATION  A. Apriori Algorithm Apriori algorithm is one Boolean Association Rule  Mining algorithm proposed by Agrawal et al. It is the foundation of the level algorithm and the most typical level algorithm. It is the most successful and first-class algorithm among Boolean Association Rule Mining algorithms.  Its core technology is widely used by other types of Boolean Association Rule Mining algorithms [7].

Apriori uses an iterative method called the layer-by-layer searching, k-itemset is used to search for (k +1)-itemset.

First, find the collection of frequent 1-itemset, which is denoted as L1.  L1 is used to find the collection L2 of frequent 2-itemset and L2 is used to find L3, and so on until no frequent k-itemset is found.  Searching for each Lk requires scanning the database each time.  Therefore, Apriori algorithm has two fatal performance bottlenecks:  1.  Repeatedly scanning the transaction database requires a lot of I/O load.  In each loop of k, each element in candidate itemset Ck must be verified by scanning the database to find out if it joins Lk.  If a large frequent itemset contains 10 major items, and then need scan the transaction database at least 10 times.

2.  Very large candidate itemsets are possibly generated.

The number of candidate itemset Ck generated by L k-1 grows exponentially, for example, 104 1-frequent itemset possibly generates 2-frequent candidate itemset with about 107 elements.  Such a large candidate itemset is a challenge to time, memory and space.

B. Apriori Algorithm Improvements For the above-mentioned issues, it can be resolved by  compressing the transactions and classifying the transactions and data sets.

Compress the number of the transactions used for further iterative scan.  If the transaction does not contain any k itemset, it can not contain any (k + l) item set. The DELETE flag may be added to these transactions and they are no longer considered while scanning the database.

The division of transaction data sets divides transaction data sets into three disjoint blocks based on different majors.

As to questions raised by the user, scan the corresponding block and obtain maximal frequent itemsets for different majors. This can significantly reduce the consumption of time, memory and space.

C. Application and Implementation of Apriori Algorithm This paper applied the improved association rules  algorithm to dig out the association analysis between keywords in question-answering system. Find out a keyword or keywords which often appear together, and find out the correlation or relationship.  Correlation analysis, which is same as the majority of text-based analysis of the same data set, first pre-cut and preprocess the text data, and then call the association rule mining algorithms.  Generate a keyword associated table from the generated association rules, and calculate the correlation between the keywords through the associated table.

All the documentation sets are regarded as the transaction database, each document (questions or answers) is regarded as a transaction, the words contained in each document is regarded as a collection of item sets, and keyword groups in the document are regarded as a set of transactions. Then the text transaction can be expressed as: {Document ID, Keyword 1, Keyword 2, Keyword 3, ... ..., Keyword n}.

Keyword association analysis in text database is changed to association mining of transaction in transaction database, and meanwhile similarity analysis of the problem is changed to association rules mining of transaction in transaction database.

Text-based Association associated analysis, which is same as traditional association rules mining algorithm, also includes two main steps:  1. Dig out frequent keywords, which are frequent itemsets.

2. Generate the association rules between keywords according to frequent itemsets.

In the phase of algorithm implementation, transaction number is 437, setting support value is 0.02 and confidence level is 0.6.  Part of the association rules from mining results are expressed in the form of spreadsheet (no, front, rear, S, C) and their meanings are (the serial number of generated association rules, the antecedent of association rules, the consequent of association rules. support, confidence).

Association rules can be gotten by running query on combinations of the antecedent and consequent.

Partial results shown in Table 1.

TABLE I. ASSOCIATION RULES BASED ON KEYWORDS TABLE  No Front Rear  S C  1  Computer  Software 0.0934256  0.6  2 Conclusion  Prove 0.1237364 0.7236185  3  Algorithm  Scan 0.0153402 0.6666667  Association rules, which are composed of the keywords of antecedent and consequent from the query on one same record, are stored in the association table. If the administrators are not satisfied with the results, he can adjust the support, confidence value and re-run the test process until satisfied.



IV. STRONG ASSOCIATION RULES GENERATED BY FREQUENT ITEMSETS  The second step of association rule mining, which extracts the strong association rules from frequent itemsets, is relatively easier than the first step generating frequent itemsets.

Algorithm: 1. For each frequent itemset M, obtain all of its non-  empty subset [8] .

2. For each non-empty subset S of M, set R=M-S and  generate association rules S ? R. If this rule meets the minimum confidence, it is the strong association rules and then added to the rule base.

After testing, set the minimum confidence level to 60%, and the relevant answers user gets are the most reasonable.

If the minimum confidence level is set lower, it will produce a large number of irrelevant results. If it is set higher, it will obtain the less relevant results, which would not achieve its role.



V. CONCLUSION In order to enhance intelligence of Question-Answering  system, this paper focused on in-depth research in the  optimization of information processing in the system, and applied the improved association rules algorithm into intelligent Question-Answering system, dug out the potential rules which user uses to sort the results in the process of browsing the results, and then generated the rule base and optimized the processing of information. The practical application shows that the optimization of information processing has greatly been improved by applying the association rules algorithm in intelligent Question- Answering system.
