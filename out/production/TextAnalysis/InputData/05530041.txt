Abstract-Association mining can produce many association  rules. It is widely recognized that the set of association rules  can rapidly grow to be unwieldy, especially when the support  requirements are relatively low, making it difficult for end  users to identify those that are of particular interest to them.

Therefore, it is important to remove insignificant rules and  prune redundant information as well as utilize the discovered  information for meaningful purposes in different applications.

Many researchers have considered various kinds of solutions to  the above problem. For example, to efficiently mine association  rules based on frequent itemsets; to mine interesting  association rules based on user-specified constraints; to mine  non-redundant association rules. However, the number of  produced association rules is still in a large amount and not all  of them are useful for the end users' requests. In this research  we focus on post mining of non-redundant and informative  association rules that match the user interests.

I. INTRODUCTION  Association mining can produce many association rules.

It is widely recognized that the set of association rules can  rapidly grow to be unwieldy, especially when the support  requirements are relatively low. In general, mining a large  set of frequent itemsets leads to a large number of rules  being presented to the user, many of which are redundant  and difficult to analyze. A primary goal of the proposed  approach is to reduce the number and redundancy of the  rules provided to the user.

Many researchers have considered various kinds of  solutions to the above problem, and these can be divided    into the following three categories: First is efficient  association mining based on frequent itemsets. This  category's research objective is to enumerate all frequent  itemsets, and to produce association rules based on the  derived frequent itemsets. Second is mining interesting  association rules. This category's research objective is to  incorporate user-specified constraints on the kind of rules  generated or to defme objective metrics of interest. Third is  mining non-redundant association rules. This category's  Zhiqiang Chen  School of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering  University of Oklahoma  Norman, OK, U.S.A.

chzqiang@ou.edu  research objectives include the generation of non-redundant  association rules.

However, the number of produced association rules is  still in a large amount and not all of them are useful for the  end users' requests. In this research we propose a method  for post mining of non-redundant association rules. The  generated association rules are then applied to sensor  network databases of a traffic monitoring site for missing  data estimation purpose, in which data missing by a sensor  is estimated using the data generated by its related sensors.

The experimental results show that our proposed technique  can efficiently perform sensor data estimation based on the  post-mining results from non-redundant rules in sensor  streams.

The paper is organized as follows: in section 1, we give  an overall introduction of this paper. In section 2, we  present the background information of non-redundant  association rule mining and missing data estimation. In  section 3, we present the method of post mining association  rules for sensor data estimation. We present the  experimental results in section 4. Finally, in section 5 we  conclude the paper.



II. BACKGROUND  In this section, we review the background information of  non-redundant association rule mining and missing data  estimation in sensor network applications.

A. Non-redundant Association Rule Mining  An association rule is an implication of the form X=> Y    (s, c), where X and Y are frequent sets of items (also called  itemsets) in a database, and X n Y = <p. The parameter s,  support of the rule, represents the percentage of records that  contain both X and Y in the database. The parameter c,  confidence of the rule, is the percentage of records  containing X that also contain Y. An association rule is said  to hold if both s and c are above or equal to a user-specified  minimum support and confidence [1]. Association mining,  also called association rule mining, searches for interesting  relationships among items in a given database and displays  them in rule form, for example X => Y. In practice,  association mining involves fmding association rules, the  978-1-4244-6370-11$26.00  2010 IEEE V5-102  2010 2nd International Conforence on Education Technology and Computer (ICETC)  support and confidence of which are above or equal to a  user-specified minimum support and confidence,  respectively [1].

With the massive amounts of data continuously being  collected and stored in databases, it is possible for a huge  number of rules to be generated continuously. Many  researchers study and propose methods to reduce the huge  number of association rule sets. In [3], the authors proposed  the concept to mine minimal antecedent and maximal  consequent association rules with the same support and  same confidence. Using the closure of the Galois connection  [16], a generating set for all valid association rules with the  support and confidence is setup using frequent closed  itemsets and their generators; they consist of the non  redundant association rules having minimal antecedents and  maximal consequents. This concept indicates to generate  only the most informative rules. In [9], the authors proposed  a technique to mine minimal non-redundant association  rules from a quantitative closed itemset lattice. In [18], Zaki  et al proposed the concept to mine non-redundant  association rules with minimal antecedent and minimal  consequent with the same support and same confidence.

However, although the result association rule sets are  reduced, there are still a lot of rules produced and not all of  them are meaningful for the end users' requests. Therefore,  a post mining stage of association rule mining is desirable to  further prune out the unfavorable association rules. In this  paper, we proposed a post mining method to process the    non-redundant association rule set from [18], the produced  association rules are then applied to sensor network  databases of a traffic monitoring site for missing data  estimation purpose, in which data missing by a sensor is  estimated using the data generated by its related sensors.

Below, we review the related work for missing data  estimation in sensor networks.

B. Missing Data Estimation in Sensor Networks  Many articles have been published to deal with the  missing data problem, and a lot of software has been  developed based on these methods. Some of the methods  totally delete the missing data before analyzing them, like  listwise and pairwise deletion [17], while other methods  focus on estimating the missing data based on the available  information. The most popular statistical estimation  methods include mean substitution, imputation by  regression [4], hot deck imputation [7], cold deck  imputation, expectation maximization (EM) [11], multiple  imputations [14, 15], etc.

But none of the above approaches is suitable for wireless  sensor network environment, where streams of data are  constantly sent from the sensors to the server, due to several  reasons. First, how much old information should be based  on to get the associated information for the missing data  estimation? Using all of the old readings to perform the  estimation is unreasonable, especially when using an  iteration procedure until convergence to get the estimation  like in the EM Algorithm. Second, which information  should be used to perform the missing data estimation? In  the wireless sensor network, data is collected within certain  scopes and reported to the server during a certain period of  time. Different sensors have different readings at different  time periods. The current readings of one sensor may relate  not only to its previous readings, but also to other sensors'  previous or current readings. Third, the missing data may or  may not miss at random, while most of the statistical  techniques are based on the MAR assumption [10].

In [5], the authors proposed a model, called BBQ to  provide efficient query answers in sensor networks. They  use probabilistic models to answer queries. Such models can  be learned from historical data using standard algorithms,  e.g. [12]. The basic model used in BBQ is a time-varying    multivate Gaussians. First, the historical data is used to  construct the initial representation of the Probability Density  Function (PDF). Once the initial PDF is constructed, the  answer queries can be answered using the model. The model  is updated as new observations are obtained from the sensor  network, and as time passes. There are various different  models that may be more suitable in different environments  and for different classes of queries.

As more and more data streaming applications emerge,  proper data estimation algorithms for streaming data are  needed. In [13], the authors proposed using pattern  discovery in multiple time-series to estimate missing data,  but it's not well suited for sensor networks, where the  relationships between sensors are decided not only by the  time trends, but also by some other factors, like locations  and so on. In [6], the authors proposed the Window  Association Rule Mining (WARM) Algorithm for  estimating missing sensor data. WARM uses a modified  Apriori Algorithm for association rule mining to identify  sensors that report the same data for a number of times in a  sliding window, called related sensors, and then estimates  the missing data from a sensor by using the data reported by  its related sensors. WARM has been reported to perform  better than the mean substitution approach where the  average value reported by all sensors in the window is used  for estimation. However, there exist some limitations in  WARM. First, it is based on 2-frequent itemsets modified  Apriori association rule mining algorithm, which means it  can discover relationships only between two sensors and  ignores the cases where missing values are related with  multiple sensors. Second, it fmds those relationships only  when both sensors report the same value and ignores the  cases where missing values can be estimated by the  relationships between sensors that report different values.

V5-103   In view of the above challenges, we develop a technique  to perform missing data estimation based on the post mining  association rule sets between multiple sensor readings, in  which data missing by a sensor is estimated using the data  generated by its related sensors.



III. POST MINING OF NON-REDUNDANT ASSOCIATION    RULES FOR SENSOR DATA ESTMATION  In this section, we describe the notations and defmitions  that are used in the proposed technique. Also we present the  post mining non-redundant association rule technique and  use it to perform missing data estimation in the wireless  sensor network applications.

A. Preliminary Concepts  In this subsection, we describe the notations and  defmitions that are used in the proposed technique. Let I =  { i h i2, ... , in} be a set of n items. A subset X ? I is called an  itemset. A k-subset is called a k-itemset. Each transaction t  is a set of items from 1. Given a set of transactions T, the  support of an itemset X is the percentage of transactions  that contain X. A frequent itemset is an itemset the support  of which is above or equal to a user-specified support  threshold.

Let T and X be subsets of all the transactions and items  appearing in a data stream S, respectively. The concept of a  closed itemset is based on the two following functions, /  andg:j(1)= tiE II 'if tE T, iE t} and g(X) = {tE T I 'if i  E X, i E t}. Function/returns the set of itemsets included  in all the transactions belonging to T, while function g  returns the set of transactions containing a given itemset X.

An itemset X is said to be closed if and only if C(X) =  j{g(X) = fog(X) = X where the composite function C = fog  is called Galois operator or closure operator [16].

Let D = {db d2, ... , dn} be a set of n item identifiers, and  V= {Vb V2,     , vm} be a set ofm item values. An itemJ is a  combination of D and V, denoted as J= D.V. For example,  dn.vm means that an item with identifier dn has the value Vm.

An association rule is an expression X s,c ) Y, where X  and Y are interesting itemsets, and X n Y = <p. The  parameter s represents the support of the rule which is the  percentage of records that contain both X and Y in the  database (s = s(Xuy) = Ig(Xuy)lIlll), and c is the  percentage of records containing X that also contain Y,  called the confidence of the rule (c = s(XuY)/s(X) =  Ig(Xu y)1I1g(X)I). Association mining is to fmd all  association rules, the support and confidence of which are  above or equal to a user-specified minimum support and  confidence, respectively [1]. An association rule Xl  sl,c1 ) Yl is equivalent to an association rule X2    s2,c2 ) Y2, if and only if X2 s2,c2 ) Y2 can be derived  from Xl sl,c1 ) h and sl=s2, c1=c2 [17]. If Xl  s,C ) X2, X3 s,c ) X4, Xl ?X3, andX4 ?X2' we say  association rule X3 s,c ) X4 is redundant [3].

B. Post Mining o/Non-redundant Association Rules /or  Sensor Data Estiamtion  In this subsection, we describe our proposed technique  for post mining of non-redundant association rules for  sensor data estimation purpose. This algorithm is developed  based on non-redundant informative association rules which  means all rules cannot be derived from other rules and the  left hand side and right hand side of the selected rules  contain the input itemset. There are some research works  that can generate the closed itemsets and corresponding  association rules using generated closed itemsets [3 , 18].

Based on our previous works [8] we assume to have the  non-redundant association rules ready and the criteria of  selecting the rules from non-redundant rules further reduce  the number of rules to the minimum.

In this algorithm, dn.vm is treated as one item in  association rules. Dn represents the sensor which is indexed  as n. Vm represents the value of the sensor n is read as m. In  the following figure, Xinput is the itemset represent the  current round of sensor readings, it can be represented by a  set of dn.vm pairs. Xl and X2 are the itemsets in left hand side  and right hand side of association rules. Z represents all  items in X2/Xinput. Index(z) and value(z) represent the index  and value of sensor value pair z. Confidence{Xl=>X;}  represents the confidence of the rule Xl=>X2,  Support(Xl=>X2) represents the support of the rule Xl=>X2.

C represents the confidence of association rule, dn V  represents the identifier and value pair of the sensor dn.

Xestimate represents the returned estimation itemset which  contains the senor identifiers with missing values in the  current round of readings of stream data and their  corresponding estimated values. Sspecify represents the user  specified support, and Cspecify represents the user-specified  confidence.

The algorithm is described as below. The input of the  procedure Estimate includes the current round of sensor  reading, current association rule confidence, user-specified  minimum support and user-specified minimum confidence.

In line 4, all association rules that satisfy with the  conditions of minimum support and confidence are selected.

The confidence of the select association rules are calculated  in line 5. The condition of line 6 filters out the rules whose  left hand side itemset Xl does not contain the itemset Xinput.

in this case, sensor identifier is filtered based on the  enriched contextual information. The condition of line 7  filters out the rules whose right hand side itemset X2 does  not contain new estimated items. Each new item was  processed in line 8 and 9 so that missing sensor values are  V5-104   modified and updated. At the end of this procedure, an  iterative call of the same procedure keep on searching and  processing for the new association rules that are able to  make contribution on the sensor value estimation.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL STUDY  The performance of our proposed approach is studied by  means of simulation. Several different simulation  experiments are conducted in order to evaluate the proposed  technique and compare it with the Average Window Size  (A WS) approach, the linear interpolation approach, the  linear trend approach, and with the WARM approach, the  state-of-the-art data estimation algorithm in sensor  databases using 2-frequent itemsets based association  mining [6]. We compared the estimation accuracy, running  time and memory space usage when applying different  methods to the application dataset.

The dataset was collected in year 2000 at various  locations throughout the city of Austin, Texas. The data  represents the current location, the time interval, and the  number of vehicles detected during this interval. All sensor  nodes report to a single server. The sensors are deployed on  city streets, collect and store the number of the vehicles  detected for a given time interval. The vehicle counts taken  as sensor readings that are used as input for our simulation  experiments are traffic data provided by [2].

A. Performance Study of Estimation Accuracy  The evaluation of the estimation accuracy of the missing  values is done by using the average Root Mean Square Error  (RMSE):  ""I'(xa, -Xe,)' (1) RM$=  ___ l __ lI_?''? ____ _ numStates # estimations  where Xa; and Xe; are the actual value and the estimated  value, respectively; #estimations is the number of  estimations performed in a simulation run; and numStates is  the number of subsets, in which the actual readings are  distributed.

The expression  ,u  '?

'(xa, -Xe,)' represents the standard  # estimations  error and is an estimate of the standard deviation under the  assumption that the errors in the estimated values (i.e. Xai -  Xei) are normally distributed. From the defmition, we can    see the smaller the RMSE, the better the estimation  accuracy.

From Figure 2, we can see that the proposed technique  gives the best average estimation result of the above  approaches regarding the accuracy, followed by the WARM  approach. The linear interpolation, A WS, and linear trend  approaches perform no better than WARM and the proposed  approaches. From Figure 2, we can also see that the  proposed technique gives the best estimation result on the  maximum estimation accuracy, which is the root square  error for the maximum difference between the estimated and  accurate values.

The experimental results show that in terms of  memory space, the WARM approach is outperformed by all  the other four approaches. The results of the simulation  experiments show that for 108 sensors the needed memory  space using WARM is much higher than that using  proposed approach. This is because the closed lattice data  structure uses less memory space than the cube data  structures, and it only stores the condensed closed itemsets  information.

V. CONCLUSTIONS  Sensor stream applications are becoming very common  with the advances in technologies for sensor devices. In this  paper we propose a method to post mine non-redundant  association rules, and used the result to produce missing  data estimation in sensor network applications. The  objective is to further reduce the resulting rules from non  redundant association rule mining based on the users'  request, and apply the retrieved meaningful information to  perform missing data estimation in wireless sensor networks.

We have evaluated the proposed technique with real data  from a wireless sensor network of a traffic monitoring site.

Our proposed method is able to estimate missing sensor  value with both time and space efficiency, and greatly  improves the estimation accuracy. Our performance study    shows that proposed post mining of association rule mining  technique for missing sensor data estimation is an area  worth to explore.
