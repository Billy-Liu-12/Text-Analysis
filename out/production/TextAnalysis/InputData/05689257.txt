Multi-disciplinary simulation and optimism method?s research and  application of multifunctional loader

Abstract?Multi-functional loader is a complex system which is made up of so many parts and subsystems, the parts and subsystems have some degrees coupled relationships, which generate so big trouble to design. The paper builds the dynamitic mechanical simulation model, hydraulic system and control system model of loader firstly, then integrates the separate subsystems by multi-disciplinary optimization software to these isolated models, at last, gives an application example by loader executive structure?s optimization design method. The results of the data can offer a guiding role and reference for the development of multi-functional loader.
