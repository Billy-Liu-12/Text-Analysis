Justifying the Decisions for EAI Adoption in LGAs: A Validated Proposition  of Factors, Adoption Lifecycle Phases, Mapping and Prioritisation of Factors

Abstract  Local Government Authorities (LGAs) are responsible for providing reliable services and information to their citizens. However, literature indicates that LGAs have problems in meeting citizens? demands. This may be attributed to the Information Technology (IT) infrastructure limitations in LGAs that are not integrated and do not allow them to deliver end-to-end integrated services. The reason is that legacy Information Systems (IS) are usually tailored to support specific business processes and functions and are difficult to integrate. This gives rise to a need for an integrated IT infrastructure that facilitates reuse of existing applications and flexibly implementing business processes. Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) has emerged to address the intra- and inter- organisational integration in a more flexible and manageable way. Nevertheless, its application in LGAs is limited.  Thus, the authors demonstrate that it is of high importance to investigate this area within LGAs and result in research that contributes towards successful EAI adoption. In addressing the relative void, this paper proposes and validates a novel model for EAI adoption in LGAs and contributes to the body of knowledge by extending the literature. The proposed model can be used by LGAs as a tool for decision making while adopting EAI.

1. Introduction   The lack of common organisational-wide IT infrastructure has resulted in the development of a diversity of disparate applications within LGAs. The disadvantages of such heterogeneous IT infrastructures are analysed in the literature and include among others: (a) high maintenance cost, and (b) data redundancy and inconsistency [1, 9]. LGAs have attempted to overcome these problems by interconnecting their disparate applications e.g. by point-to-point interconnection [38]. Literature  indicates that integration is much more than merely interconnecting the disparate applications and the connectivity of applications was insufficient due to the fact that individual applications were not designed to interoperate with each other [21, 31].

Two more basic problems for integration are: (a) each department has several IT applications and each application has its own meaning of different objects (e.g. citizens, staff) and (b) each application has data that overlaps data in other applications. This partial redundancy generates significant data integrity problems [1, 9].

In the last decade, several public sector organisations (e.g. LGAs) turned to Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) implementations in an attempt to surmount the Year 2000 (Y2K) problem and automate their business processes [35]. Although ERP systems have addressed the Y2K problem, they only provide a partial solution for the integration problem [34]. The reason is that ERP systems were not designed to integrate disparate systems but rather to replace them to achieve integration [4].

Themistocleous et al., [33] reports that there is an increasing demand to integrate the IT infrastructures in LGAs. This demand comes from unlike categories of stakeholders in LGAs like employees and managers, citizens, and businesses. All of them seek to ease their transactions with LGAs. In this context, LGAs have realised their IT infrastructure limitations and are seeking ways to improve their efficiency, to provide better services to citizens. Literature indicates that government initiatives still need better integration solutions [6, 13, 14]. The need for integration may be attributed to several government projects that were either never implemented or abandoned immediately after implementation. Due to this many problems such as data integration and security interoperability that are technical in nature, remain most apparent at developmental and functional levels [10].

LGAs are constrained and face difficulties in: (a) overcoming their organisational and integration        problems, (b) providing quality services to citizens and (c) improving their performance and productivity. Literature indicates that governments are increasingly challenged to respond more flexibly to issues confronting local communities [17, 36].

Thus, there is a need for a technology that provides a solution to LGAs that attempts to meet their organisations requirements and integration problems.

Since EAI is a new research area within LGAs, the review on the EAI adoption area indicates gap in the normative literature. For this reason at this point the absence of theoretical model and research regarding its adoption in LGAs is identified as research issue for further investigation. The remaining structure of the paper is as follows: Section 2 proposes a novel conceptual model for EAI adoption in LGAs and discusses on four dimensions incorporated in the model. In Section 3, the authors discuss on the research methodology undertaken. Section 4 presents the case data and tests the research issues. Section 5 discusses and revises the conceptual model and finally summarising the conclusions in Section 6.

2. Proposing a Novel Conceptual Model for EAI Adoption in LGAs   Despite several private and public organisations have adopted EAI, its application in LGAs is limited.

This may show that LGAs develop EAI solutions at a slower pace and they can be characterised as a laggard comparing. The small number of EAI applications in LGAs has resulted in limited research with many issues, like its adoption requiring further research. Literature indicates various models analysing factors influencing EAI adoption in the private and public domain [3, 16, 22, 32]. The applicability and validity of these models is arguable and under research in LGAs, as these were proposed to support the decision-making process in other sectors and not in LGAs. To the best of the authors? knowledge, none of these existing models explored the mapping and importance of factors on the adoption lifecycle phases. This paper makes a step forward and contributes to the body of knowledge as it presents the: (a) factors influencing EAI adoption in LGAs, (b) adoption lifecycle phases, (c) mapping of factors on the adoption lifecycle phases and (d) prioritisation of factors on the adoption lifecycle phases. Thus, proposing a novel model for EAI adoption in LGAs. The authors claim that such an EAI adoption process is vital and novel as: it extends established norms for EAI adoption, by employing Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) technique for prioritising the factors, thus, enabling LGAs to produce more robust proposals for EAI adoption.

2.1. Factors influencing EAI adoption in LGAs   The model comprises of twenty one factors  based on the EAI and government literature. For example, factors identified from the EAI literature are cost, benefits, barriers, internal pressures, external pressures, IT infrastructure, IT sophistication, IT support, and evaluation frameworks. Factors identified from the government literature are formalisation, centralisation, managerial capabilities, project championship, personnel IT knowledge, technological risks, data privacy and security, higher administrative authority support, return on investments, critical mass, market knowledge, citizen satisfaction, size, and top management support. These factors have been categorised according to Pressure Factors (PF), Technological Factors (TF), Support Factors (SF), Financial Factors (FF) and Organisational Factors (OF). The authors suggest that while adopting EAI in LGAs, realising the factors influencing the decision making process may provide a deeper understanding on EAI adoption process. Thus, the authors propose the following research issue for further investigation:   Research Issue 1 ? EAI Adoption Factors: Factors can influence the decision making process for EAI adoption in LGAs.

2.2. Adoption Lifecycle Phases   Paul et al., [25] suggests that technology adoption can be comprehended as an organisation?s decision to acquire a specific technology and make it available to target users for their task performance.

Adoption lifecycle involves a sequence of distinct and consecutive phases an organisation passes through before taking the decision to adopt a technology [7, 8]. In this regard, Rogers [27] explains that adoption lifecycle is the process through which an individual or other decision- making unit passes from first knowledge of an innovation, to forming an attitude toward the innovation, to a decision to adopt or reject, to implementation of the new idea, and to confirmation of this decision. Several other researchers proposed different adoption processes [7, 8, 15]. These research studies illustrate the importance of adoption lifecycles, however, these adoption studies also discuss on phases beyond the adoption phase.

However, it is not the intent of the authors to discuss on the phases beyond the adoption phase. The reason is that as the current research investigates on EAI adoption not on EAI implementation and other         phases ahead of implementation. After analysing the literature [15, 7, 2], the authors propose that four phases are important while adopting technologies such as: (a) motivation, (b) conception, (c) proposal, and (d) adoption decision and explained as below.

Motivation signifies the state when an organisation becomes aware of a technology and attempts to acquire knowledge about the technology.

This leads to motivating the organisation in ascertaining an attitude towards its adoption [2, 13, 15].  Conception refers to a plan of action that the organisation should pursue. In highly innovative organisations presumably this phase is exhibited by several organisational members such as creating an attitude towards technology adoption [2, 13, 15].

Proposal refers to the making a formal proposition for technology adoption to the rest of the organisation [2, 13, 15]. Proposing the innovative idea to the rest of the organisation is very crucial for making technology adoption decision. Adoption Decision is the actual phase where the organisations take the decision to adopt a specific technology [2, 13, 15]. The adoption phases might be considered while adopting EAI to extend the current research in EAI adoption. Therefore, the authors propose the following research issue for further investigation:   Research Issue 2 ? Adoption Lifecycle Phases: LGAs can pass through several adoption lifecycle phases while adopting EAI.

2.3. Mapping EAI adoption factors on the adoption lifecycle phases   The research conducted hitherto indicates that the process of EAI adoption and use in different sectors [3, 16, 22, 32]. The existing studies on EAI adoption have investigated on factors, actors and the causal relationship among and between them. Yet from a conceptual and empirical point of view, none of the existing studies related to EAI adoption has investigated the mapping of the factors influencing EAI adoption process on the adoption lifecycle phases. The authors consider this as a literature gap and report that it is important to manage the EAI adoption process in LGAs. This can be attributed to several reasons e.g.: (a) EAI is very often considered as high-risk project [12], (b) proliferation of EAI technologies [20]. Conversely, LGAs are characterised as laggards and often resist to the technological changes, however, these changes should thus be managed as their importance in bringing change in the organisation is vital [33, 23].

The authors assert that it is vital to study the mapping of factors on the adoption lifecycle phases.

Along with the factors influencing EAI adoption in LGAs, their mapping on the adoption lifecycle phases also make a novel contribution at the conceptual level. The authors suggest that while adopting EAI, realising the factors influencing EAI adoption on the adoption lifecycle phases may provide much deeper comprehension to the LGA decision makers. Thus, the authors propose the following research issue for further investigation:   Research Issue 3 - Mapping EAI Adoption Factors: Influential factors for EAI adoption can be mapped on different adoption lifecycle phases to support the decision makers while adopting EAI.

2.4. Prioritising the importance of EAI adoption factors on the adoption lifecycle phases   In the context of decision making in LGAs, several IT projects involve distributed decision- making based on a division of control and powers, as opposed to private organisation that have direct and undivided power over decisions within their span of control [12, 18, 37]. LGA structures, business processes and functions are often difficult to change as hierarchical bureaucratic structures often reflect a commitment to outmoded cultural values emphasizing risk aversion and valuing control of functional silos [23, 30]. Due to this, LGAs faced failures in several IT projects and the loss of IT investments resulting from inadequacies in making the business case [23]. From a technical perspective, EAI projects have many significant differences comparing to other IT projects [17]. The rationale for using EAI is not to build a system from scratch but to piece together multiple incompatible and in many cases heterogeneous applications [31, 17]. Thus, the emphasis is on the integration of existing systems and not on the development of new systems. EAI projects bring a chain of organisational changes in terms of structure, process control and workflow. These changes are deeper comparing to the other IT projects as they impact multiple systems, departments and employees and organisations itself [28].

EAI is recognised as an emerging solution to architecture design integrating previously separated and isolated systems to give them greater leverage and improve their performance [12, 17]. With several researchers proposing EAI adoption factors, it may appear impractical for LGAs to devote their efforts to        concurrently address and comprehend the factors.

Partly, this can also be attributed to the lack of in- depth understanding and knowledge on EAI in LGAs [12]. This may require considering the prioritisation of factors and identifying the importance of factors [19, 30]. Lam and Chin [18] support that determining the importance of factors enables organisations to develop priorities and in turn, improve their decision making process. Salmeron and Herrero [30] and Saaty [29] report that organisations may need to consider the judgements of several individuals while performing the prioritisation of factors. Due to their diverse roles and responsibilities, backgrounds and objectives, individuals may present different judgements on the prioritisation of the factors [11, 18]. The diverse judgements are accommodated and synthesized by using the AHP technique [19, 30].

The existing studies on EAI adoption have studied on factors demonstrating the causal inter-relationships between the EAI adoption factors, actors and factors with the causal relationship among and between    them, research studies on the business perspectives [17, 31] and technical capabilities of EAI in integrating IT infrastructures [12, 17]. From a conceptual and empirical viewpoint, none of these studies have investigated on prioritising the importance of factors on the adoption lifecycle phases. Thus, the authors propose the following research issue for further investigation:   Research Issue 4 - Prioritising EAI Adoption Factors:  Prioritising the factors based on their importance on the adoption lifecycle phases can influence EAI adoption in LGAs.

Figure 1 illustrates the conceptual EAI adoption model in LGAs while RI ? 1, RI ? 2, RI ? 3 and RI ? 4 representing the Research Issues. This model may assist in improving the level of analysis for EAI adoption and supporting LGAs while adopting EAI.

Figure 1: Proposed Conceptual Model for EAI Adoption in LGAs   3. Research Methodology   This paper attempts to investigate on EAI adoption in LGAs. The authors have followed an interpretive, qualitative case study approach to conduct this research. Interpretitivism stance was adopted, as the aim of this paper is to validate the  proposed EAI adoption model. An interpretivism stance allows the authors to navigate and better explain this phenomenon. The authors suggest that a qualitative approach is more appropriate as it can be used to: (a) investigate less acknowledged phenomena like EAI in LGAs, (b) validate the conceptual EAI adoption model, (c) examine the         phenomenon in its natural setting, (d) provide considerable flexibility during interviews and observations and, (e) learn from practice. In the this paper, a single case study was conducted at LGA_A.

Case studies enable the researchers to investigate a phenomenon in depth, getting close to the phenomenon, providing rich primary data and revealing its deep structure within the organisational context. In doing so, various data collection methods such as interviews, documentation, and observation were used based on a detailed questionnaire.

Three participants from LGA_A were interviewed using structured (and semi-structured or unstructured) interviews. Structured interviews were based on the interview agenda. Semi-structure interviews took place without the use of an interview agenda. Using these interviews the authors attempted to clarify some issues that derived from structured interviews. All the structure or semi-structured interviews took place at interviewees? office.

Unstructured interviews dealt with discussions that the authors had with interviewees but without using a structured or semi-structured interview. The authors had unstructured interviews during lunches, coffee breaks, out of office hours. Using unstructured interviews some important data regarding the case studies were collected. All of the interviews were tape recorded and transcripts prepared after each individual interview. Tape recording supported the authors in collecting accurate data and interpreting them without time pressures.  The bias considered as a danger in using qualitative research approach is overcome by data triangulation. The use of multiple data collection methods makes the triangulation possible, which provides stronger substation of theory [5]. For this research (a) data (b) methodological and, (c) interdisciplinary triangulation, types of triangulation were used.

4. Case Data   To test the aforesaid research issues, a series of case studies were undertaken in the United Kingdom (UK) LGAs with this section reporting the case of one of them. For confidentiality reasons the authors employ the coded-name as LGA_A to refer to this entity. Structured, semi-structured and unstructured interviews were conducted in LGA_A to investigate EAI adoption. The views from only those stakeholders were deemed that were involved in EAI adoption and evaluation, as it was not possible to interview all the stakeholders. From LGA_A, the stakeholders that were interviewed included: Head of IT (HIT), Senior Development Engineer (SDE) and Service Delivery Manager (SDM).

Integration Problems: LGA_A is a big borough and has several service areas (departments).

Each service area has its own IT infrastructure.

LGA_A consisted of numerous heterogeneous IS that were based on a diversity of platforms, operating systems, data structures and computer languages.

These individual applications were not developed in a coordinated way but instead evolved as a result of the latest technological innovation. This led to incompatible systems with integration problems. The need for an integrated and flexible IT infrastructure has been necessitated with the existing infrastructure causing numerous problems. These problems became an obstacle as they prevented it from implementing its business goals.

Motivations for EAI Adoption: LGA_A took the decision to advance in their service delivery by adopting EAI to develop an integrated IT infrastructure. This decision has been widely supported by the UK central government. The analysis of relevant documents related to LGA_A, indicate that LGA_A had immense pressure from the central government. This pressure can be signified as external pressure for providing integrated service delivery.  To this end, it appears that the problems with IT infrastructure in LGA_A and the central government influence formed a kind of external and internal pressures. External pressures appear to deal with citizens and other government agencies and councils where internal pressures focus on factors such as managerial and technical issues, with HIT supporting these factors as vital for EAI adoption.

These finding validate the literature that support the (a) IT infrastructure, (b) internal and (c) external pressures as factors that influence the decision making process for EAI adoption [32]. LGA_A initiated a plan for developing a pilot project. The motivation was to address the limitations of its existing systems, and to meet the targets set by the central government. The objective of this pilot project was to demonstrate to LGA_A and to other LGAs that investing in a long-term programme of integration between packaged systems and legacy applications is necessary. On this basis the adoption of such integration architecture within LGA_A and other LGAs will deliver measurable business benefit.

The members involved in this project had their rational motivations behind supporting the decision for EAI adoption. It appears that internal as well as external pressures influence the decision making process for EAI adoption in LGA_A. Another factor that appears to influence the adoption of enterprise application integration is related to the organisational IT capability i.e. IT infrastructure limitations in LGA_A.

EAI Adoption Process: LGA_A was faced with the option of withdrawing their various systems away        and start developing integrated systems again, or finding a method of migrating to a new generation of systems, which would support integration. Due to the rich source of information contained in them and to make development more manageable, the second option was chosen. Hence, in 2004 LGA_A started examining available solutions to meet the challenge for developing a standardised, flexible, integrated and homogeneous IT infrastructure. After reviewing these solutions, LGA_A took the decision to introduce ERP systems to solve their integration problems and provide better services. Also, LGA_A was aiming at integrating its business processes through an ERP solution. However, soon LGA_A realised that ERP systems cannot communicate with other packaged systems and have limitations, as they cannot exchange information with other vendor applications.

The insufficient nature of their IT infrastructure and the need for integration led LGA_A to revisit their strategies for developing integrated IT infrastructure. Thus, the top management formed an ambitious vision aiming at: (a) enabling integration internally and externally; (b) achieving effective and efficient joined up government and (c) enabling electronic request and delivery of services. As a result, supporting the decision making process for EAI adoption. LGA_A did not take the decision to fully integrate the borough since such a solution had a high cost. SDE reported that the plan for developing an integrated IT infrastructure on a large scale was considered of high risk as there is no single integration technology or software package that supports the development of an integrated IT infrastructure and there is a lack of knowledge in LGA_A regarding on EAI solutions. This indicates that barriers like the lack of knowledge on EAI and the lack of a single EAI product that solves all integration problems, influenced their decisions.

As the plans for integrating LGA_A were not completely justified, its top management suggested a pilot to be run and evaluate its outcome. The pilot demonstrates that the integration is technically feasible, can deliver significant benefits to LGA_A and may assist in extracting relevant EAI barriers and risks. Such a decision is supported by the literature [26]. LGA_A hoped that then central government would recognise the success and importance of the project and award it ?National Project? status. As the decision was taken to adopt EAI solution for the pilot project and for other projects in future, the interviewees was asked to comment on whether what factors negatively and positively affected the EAI adoption process. HIT and SDM replied that:   ? ?. most vital negative factor was the silo mentality among our older staff members that resisted to such a change in the  department ? this was also because there were insufficient technical skills and expertise to do integration and our staff lacked understanding of business integration ? for this reason we had to invest money to train our staff to build integration skills ??   The HIT also reported on positive factors:   ? ? despite there were some problems but  when systems integrated through EAI, the systems physically got better and everybody saw that the working conditions and our resources are improving i.e. performance as well as the systems improved. As a consequence of doing this the moral of the staff improved and communication and information sharing was enhanced ??   In the next section, the authors present the  testing of research issues and highlighting the empirical results.

4.1. Testing Research Issue 1 ? Factors influencing EAI adoption in LGAs   Table 1 provides with the analysis of the factors using Miles and Huberman [24] scale of less important ( ), medium important ( ) and most important ( ) and where the interviewees did not respond, the researcher uses ? ? symbol to illustrate as no response.

Testing Research Issue 2 ? Adoption Lifecycle Phases   The interviewees were asked to comment and  illustrate the importance of the aforesaid adoption lifecycle phases based on the EAI project. Initially, all the interviewees agreed that these phases are very important. For example SDE reported that:   ?? yes these phases are very important with a perfect breakdown and we faced these phases in EAI project ??  Whereas, HIT reported that:   ?? proposal and adoption decision phases  are vital and are the physical aspects whereas motivation and conception are not inevitably physical aspects unless you got a fairly refined strategic approach to what you want to do ??   SDM stated that before the motivation phase,  they also faced external driver phase in the project.

LGA_A was driven by some external influences e.g.

pressure from central government to improve their service delivery. Due to such influences, LGA_A was motivated to run a pilot project. In addition, the senior development support engineer and the HIT stated that they faced another phase before the proposal phase such as the discussion phase and the research phase respectively. After discussing on these phases with the interviewees, it appears that both have the same underlying meaning i.e.

?? before adoption decision phase we may have research phase ? by research this we mean that we do some sort of discussions to run a pilot case study and this could be before the proposal phase. The reason to bring this phase before proposal is that if we need resources that actually enable us to do the pilot study, then we might need to take the decision to get the money to do it ??   After analysing all the interviews, the authors  noted that external driver phase can be same as motivation phase. The reason is that an organisation may be motivated to take a step when it is either influenced internally due to some problem or externally through some stakeholders influence.

Whereas, the discussion or research phase may also be the same as proposal phase. The rationale is that in proposal phase e.g. the departments making decisions to adopt technology need to some sort of research and provide substantiated reasons for approval from the  organisation based on the research, besides this the departments need to analyse their requirements and assess their capabilities for acquiring a technology.

Thus, the interviewees were asked to illustrate the importance of the adoption lifecycle phases. The importance of each phase is presented in Table 2.

Table 2: Importance of Adoption Lifecycle Phases   Adoption Lifecycle Phases HIT SDE SDM Motivation Conception  Proposal Adoption Decision   4.3. Testing Research Issue 3 ? Mapping EAI adoption factors on adoption lifecycle phases   Before commencing on the mapping of factors on the adoption lifecycle phases, the interviewees were explained how to perform the mapping.

Thereafter, the interviewees were asked to map the factors influencing EAI adoption on different phases of the adoption lifecycle. The interviewees went through a rigorous thinking process and mapped the factors (based on its influence) on each phase of the adoption lifecycle. Table 3 illustrates the results of the mapping of factors for motivation phase only.

The factors with less (i.e. one interviewee supporting and other two not) and no (i.e. none of the interviewees supporting) support are discarded. The reason is that these factors had less influence or did not influence on a specific phase. On the other hand, factors with full (i.e. all three interviewees supporting) and moderate (i.e. two interviewees supporting and third not supporting) support are utilised for further empirical research.

Prioritising the importance of EAI adoption factors on the adoption lifecycle phases   Table 1 validates the factors using Miles and Huberman [24] scale, whereas, Table 3 illustrates the mapping of factors on the motivation phase of the adoption lifecycle. However, these tables do not illustrate the important of each factor on the adoption lifecycle phases. This section introduces AHP technique to prioritise the importance of factor influencing EAI adoption. Table 4 illustrates the global weights-based prioritisation of factors for example on only motivation phase (due to the constraints on length of the paper, the authors did not include the prioritisation results of other three adoption lifecycle phases). These weights are obtained by using the Expert Choice (EC) software and the conclusions drawn from them are the final results of the analysis of collective judgements provided by the panel of interviewees selected for LGA_A. The results presented in these tables do not mean that any factor is unimportant. It merely exhibits interviewees? perceptions on the importance of factors on the adoption lifecycle phases.

Discussions and Revision of the Model   According to the empirical findings, only two factors were not validated i.e. formalisation and evaluation framework. The reasons are: (a) LGA_A did not follow any formal procedure to assess EAI technological solution and (b) no evaluation framework was used to assess EAI technological solution but relied on the software vendor. Other factors have either directly or indirectly influenced the decision making process for EAI technological solution adoption. On the other hand, six new factors were identified such as (a) data consistence and  project delivery timescale as internal pressure factors, (b) stakeholder?s pressure and competition as external pressure factors, (c) stakeholder?s support as a support factors, and (d) central government grants as a financial factor. Four new adoption lifecycle phases were also identified from the empirical findings from LGA_A: [(a) external driver and/or (b) driving force], [(c) discussion and/or (d) research phase]. External driver or driving force phase are prior to the motivation phase, discussion and or research phases are prior to the proposal phase, whereas, adoption decision phase was also reported with a different term i.e. investment phase. The findings illustrate that the role of factors, adoption lifecycle phases, mapping of factors and prioritising the importance EAI adoption factors on the adoption lifecycle phases had high importance during EAI adoption process in LGA_A Thus, the authors propose that while exploring EAI adoption in LGAs: (a) factors, (b) adoption lifecycle phases, (c) mapping of factors and (d) prioritising the importance of factors on the adoption lifecycle phases provides a deeper understanding of interrelationships within LGAs. In doing so, the revised proposed EAI adoption model may: (a) overcome IT infrastructure limitations within LGAs, (b) improve the level of analysis and (c) support LGAs when adopting EAI.

6. Conclusions   LGAs are complex organisations and are managed by the consent and rules set by the central government. They are influenced by other government authorities and ministries, and their IS adoption involve distributed decision-making based on a division of control and powers [17, 39].

Conversely, private organisations have direct and undivided power over decisions and flexible management style with inter-departmental teams working in central coordination [12, 37]. This distinction illustrates that LGAs have a bureaucratic nature and are committed to outdated cultural values.

Such characteristics emphasize risk aversion and insist that structures enhance control rather than connected thinking with silos in LGAs, let alone between them [37]. Moreover, each LGA displays differences in the way: (a) their business processes are implemented to provide citizen services, and (b) makes its decisions that differs a lot from other private organisations [15, 37].  These theorised conceptions distinguish LGAs from other sectors.

EAI represents an attractive proposition to LGAs, since EAI offers the opportunity to leverage the systems into a seamless chain of processes and present a unified view of their information [12, 28].

When such leveraging and presentation occurs, LGAs         may capitalise on their opportunities offered by LGA initiatives (e.g. e-Government) because then they may efficiently interact with their citizens and other stakeholders on a consistent basis [12]. However, EAI is an emerging area within LGAs, thus, there remains an absence of theoretical models, which means there is still a case for the identification of factors that affect the decision making process for EAI adoption and identification of adoption lifecycle phases, with the development of empirically validated underpinnings argued, justified and presented in this paper. The authors sought to address the established voids by proposing a novel conceptual model for EAI adoption in LGAs. The model takes into consideration the parameters that were identified in the normative literature as influencing factors and adoption lifecycle phases. The proposed conceptual model is novel as it includes: (a) the model consists of a set of factors influencing EAI adoption in LGA_A and incorporates factors identified separately in previous studies. These factors are used for the developing an EAI adoption model in LGAs, (b) the model incorporates adoption lifecycle phases.

Empirical findings illustrate that LGA_A passed through these phases while adopting EAI, (c) the model assimilates the mapping of factors influencing EAI adoption in LGA_A on the adoption lifecycle phases, and (d) the model incorporates the prioritisation (importance) of EAI adoption factors in LGA_A on the adoption lifecycle phases.

The model can be used as a tool for decision- making to support LGAs and allow decision makers and researchers to understand and analyse EAI adoption. The concepts of the proposed model can be used for the adoption of inter-organisational IS since such systems should focus on integrated technologies and infrastructures. An interpretive, qualitative case study approach was selected to conduct this research.

It is not the intention of this paper to offer prescriptive guidelines to EAI adoption but rather, describe case study perspectives that allow other researchers to relate their experiences to those reported. Hence, offering a broader understanding of the phenomenon of EAI adoption in LGAs.

Therefore, the lessons learnt are a result of the description provided and do not seek to be prescriptive. These lessons are summarised below:  Lesson 1: The practical implications of the mapping of factors on adoption lifecycle phases are ? this process can support in better understanding the factors influencing EAI adoption in LGAs. This is vital as it can also support the managements? decision-making process while introducing EAI.

Lesson 2: Prioritising the importance of EAI adoption factors on adoption lifecycle phases can further enhance the decision making process in LGAs. During the mapping of factors, the  importance of factors was not recognised.

Prioritising the factors can assist LGA officials in realising and understanding the factors influencing EAI adoption in LGAs.

Lesson 3: Findings on the mapping of factors and prioritising the importance of factors on adoption lifecycle phases reflect that each interviewee from LGA_A has relatively different conception while mapping the factors and prioritising the importance of factors on adoption lifecycle phases. This may also illustrate that within different LGAs, interviewees? understanding, knowledge and ability to comprehend the importance of factors may differ.

Lesson 4: Findings related to the mapping of factors and prioritising the importance of factors cannot be generalised as they may also differ from one LGA to the other.

Hitherto, the authors highlighted the individual elements of the contributions and research novelty presented in this paper. However, at the wider context this research aimed to enhance the technical decision making process while adopting EAI technologies in LGAs. This was achieved by proposing and validating a novel model (Figure 1) for EAI adoption in the practical arena (LGA_A).

The key beneficiaries are the decision makers and practitioners within LGAs, and researchers within the academic community. All of these benefit from the research in this paper as a guideline to analyse and understand EAI adoption in LGAs. In doing so, this research work significantly contributes to the body of knowledge and practice in the areas of EAI and the local government domain by providing sufficient support to the decision makers in speeding up the EAI adoption process in LGAs.
