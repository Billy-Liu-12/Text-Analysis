Co-occurrence Analysis in Innovation Management:   Data Processing of an Online Brainstorming Platform

Abstract--To adapt to the rapid changing business environment, it is important for businesses to adopt open innovation strategy in their daily research and development routines. The Creative Concerto Platform (CCP) created by CCIS (Center for Creativity and Innovation Studies) helps organizations to leverage the power of crowd sourcing. CCP is an online brainstorming platform for product and service innovation process, which enables a variety of stakeholders to participate in a large scale brainstorming activity over the Internet.

Due to the excessive number of participants of CCP in contrast to traditional face-to-face brainstorming sessions, the large amount of data generated in the process can not be analyzed efficiently without additional help. To identify the key issues and ideas in such a big data pool, we developed an information system module to extract key concepts in each article posted by the participants. Furthermore, to get a better understanding of how the key concepts are linked together conceptually in the discussion session, we utilized co-occurrence analysis to see which concepts occurs in pair and the frequency of the co-occurrence instances, and a visual presentation of the network of concepts can be generated to give us a better understanding of the relationships between the concepts. The system can also generate network data and visual presentation of the relationships between the participants for us to identify if there?s any opinion leader emerges from the brainstorming process.

In this essay, we use data form a CCP event as an example to illustrate how co-occurrence analysis can be helpful for the data processing and creative idea generation process, and why it is important for business to deploy open innovation strategy to gain innovative inputs from users / customers.



I. INTRODUCTION: THE IMPORTANCE OF OPEN INNOVATION   The term ?Open Innovation? is coined by [4], stating that  a business should exchange opinions, knowledge, and creative ideas with other entities, be it other businesses, customers or stakeholders such as the government and social organizations, as innovation activities are becoming more and more open and distribute. To facilitate effective innovation, a business must encourage the flow of knowledge across organization boundary, and try to develop innovative ideas into actual products or services actively. The concept of co-creation [11] also emphasizes the importance to work with customers and stakeholders to bring in their ideas and values, which has been widely accepted by now.

Illustration I. Closed Innovation Model [3]   [6] defines innovation as to integrate opinion and creative ideas both from inside the organization and from the customers, and to design products and services in accordance.

Traditionally this process only occurs inside of an organization and is called ?closed innovation?. In this closed model all research and development personnel are employees, resulted in a large R&D department requiring large budget to operate. To protect the innovations generated in house, the business must further invest in protection mechanism such as patents and intellectual law offices. In short, the process of closed innovation is entirely isolated form the outside world.

Due to the confidential nature of the innovative activities in a closed system, the ideas and inventions will go through a filtering process in the organization, and few of them will actually make it to the market. The ones that have not passed the ?idea filter? may never see the light of day, results in a complete waste of R&D resources. [4]  In contrast, open innovation breaks the organizational boundary by promoting knowledge exchange across the organization boundary. It is encouraged to find new ways to utilize unused innovations, such as licensing and technology transfer to other companies. Cooperating with other businesses by exchange in-house innovations opens up a new horizon to create new markets as well as expand existing ones.

As stated in [7], open innovation will benefit both parties of exchange, as they can trade unused innovations to each other which will result in greater resource efficiency.

For example, market research done after the product launch is much less efficient then the one that is integrated into the product designing process [14]. Engaging end customers in product development process will help a business to identify customer needs more effectively, therefore archive better cost control.

Illustration II. Open Innovation Model [3]   The main idea of open innovation is to seek for new source of innovation. Traditionally innovation activities are conducted only by in-house departments. When a business adopts open innovation, innovations can arise from internal corporate venture as well as cooperation and transactions with other businesses, to further utilize resources and enhance competences of the organization. The bi-directional nature of open innovation means that a business should look for un-used innovations and put it on the market so that it can be better utilized, and at the same time it should also survey the market for useful innovations that might generate synergy if put together with in-house assets. Open innovation will indeed enable an organization to use its resources more effectively, and the benefit of integrating in-house and on-the-market innovative components might be much more then just resource efficiency and monetary income ----- new products and service opportunity might arise from this kind of innovative mash up. [12]  In this article we?ll introduce a platform which is really useful for getting innovative inputs from outside the organization boundary --- the Creative Concerto Platform.

The CCP is a combination of systematic methodology to facilitate an online version of brainstorming process, and an information system to support this particular activity as well as pre-event preparation and post-event analysis. We?ll show how co-occurrence analysis is a useful tool when there?s a need to get insights from massive amount of short articles posted in a brainstorming session like this by providing examples from an event we held early 2012.



II. THE CREATIVE CONCERTO PLATFORM  A. Background  The Creative Concerto Platform is an online brainstorming platform inspired by the IBM JAM, which provides a platform for open discussion among a very large group of participants. In the late 1990s, IBM found that they don?t have an effective way to facilitate communication and connection among the employees around the world due to its large organization size. Starting from 2001 IBM starts to hold JAM using electronic mechanism to facilitate communication and increase employee identity for the corporation. There?re more than 270 thousands of employees in IBM, and each JAM session often attracts more than 10 thousands of  participants to discuss topics proposed by the forum moderators.

During the last 10 years there were multiple JAM sessions held consists of different topics. There was service JAM to discuss how IBM can turn into a service oriented company, and there was innovation JAM to talk about how IBM can innovate better. Those JAM events still focus on issues for IBM?s own development, albeit different participants were invited for different sessions for different purposes.

Sometimes only employees are invited, and sometimes vendors and/or employee?s families join them. There?re also JAM events that are related to issues that is not just about IBM, such as the Social Business Jam in 2011. So for IBM it is not only an intra-organization communication and brainstorming tool, it is also a potential opportunity to build up a whole new service business.

Staffs at CCIS were also invited to various JAM sessions, and found the concept of online brainstorming promising.

Heterogeneous groups of participants discuss with each other intensively during 72-hour time span generated a lot of insights for both the individuals and the companies that joined the JAM event. Compared to the web forums we attend to in our daily Internet life, participate in a JAM event more like being engaged in a 3-day brainstorming activity then just an Internet bulletin board that we drop by every day, in which we only paying attention to the contents we are interested. In a JAM event the board admins are actually leading the brainstorming process by posting new topics, facilitating discussions, and tries hard to make the discussions richer and more interactive.

In Taiwan, there?re a lot of small-to ?medium companies wishing to have effective method to extract intelligence from the customer. But the system requirement and resource needed to conduct an IBM JAM like event is far too high for the SMB?s in Taiwan. The Creative Concerto Platform is an attempt to enable the SMBs to conduct IBM JAM-like online brainstorming events, which includes the following features, but also works under the business context in Taiwan: ? Online brainstorming in 72 hours: no weeks or months  long forum, just short sessions to ensure participants are fully focused mentally during the event  ? Highly Intensive: Constant interaction with the participants during the 3-day discussion session, to make sure every participant knows what?s going on in the CCP event.

? Large number of participants: In contrast to brainstorming, focus group, world caf? of other face-to-face brainstorming mechanism, hundreds of participants are expected in each CCP event.

To suit the need of Taiwanese SMBs means that: ? There won?t be as much participants as in the IBM JAM?s  case, so the participant-to-post ratio needs to be raised, to ensure a highly interactive discussion environment.

? The need to cut the cost for each CCP event hold. SMB?s are limited both in budget and human resource.

2013 Proceedings of PICMET '13: Technology Management for Emerging Technologies.

With those restrictions in mind, the CCP aims to provide an affordable yet effective mean for SMB?s in Taiwan to generate ideas online.

B. Elements of the Creative Concerto Platform  The Creative Concerto Platform is not only an information system, but a complete methodology-information system combination to trigger large scale idea generation over a short period of time. A CCP event is usually divided into three segments: pre-CCP for topic setting and event planning, on-CCP for the actual execution of the idea generation process, and post-CCP for the post-event analysis and discuss session to extract insights from the event.

As described in Table I, CCP consists of a methodology to hold a highly intensive and interactive idea generation process, as well as an information system to support the different phases of the event. The system is similar to a web forum for the participants, but the designing purpose and the experience provided to the participants are vastly different from typical web forum, as all topics for discussion are carefully designed. The result is a large amount of articles with new ideas will be generated in a 72-hour time span and will be analyzed systematically afterwards. In 2012 there were two CCP events held, each attracted around 500 people to participate and generated more than three thousand and more than eleven hundred articles respectively in 72 hours.

Below we?ll use a CCP event about the future of digital publishing industry in Taiwan as an example of how CCP works, and we?ll give an detailed description regarding how co- occurrence analysis can be useful for idea gathering and generation process.



III. CASE STUDY: ?THE CCP EVENT ABOUT INDUSTRIAL INNOVATION OF DIGITAL PUBLISHING  INDUSTRY IN TAIWAN?  A. Overview  Hardware vendors in Taiwan play an important role in the E-Book industry around the world. Companies like Foxconn and Netronix are responsible for a large amount of E-Book device manufactured, but at the same time the digital publishing market in Taiwan has not been doing well over the last few years. Major telecomm companies and publishers such as Chunghwa Telecomm, Fetnet, Cite, and UDN Group in Taiwan have been providing E-Reading service for more than half a decade, and yet no one has announced they have broken even with their E-Reading service. Hardware manufacturer such as BenQ and Netronix also start up dedicated platform to engage the E-Reading market, but to no significant success. To analyze the situation, some would say the publishers are not open enough to get all the books online [5], and some would say that the vendors have yet to provide a viable platform to provide the customers with comfortable reading experience. Also some think that Taiwanese just don?t read enough to support a digital reading industry [9].

To further identify where the problems are and to get new ideas from end users, CCIS works with GreenBook Inc. to setup a CCP event to invite related stakeholders to contribute their brain power. A variety of participants were invited from different sources such as related associations and E-Reading sites. In particular, some participants were recruited by a major marketing company in Taiwan to provide a group of participants of varied backgrounds. Below is a table consists of the participated groups and their performance in this event.

TABLE 1. METHODOLOGY / INFORMATION SYSTEM SUPPORT FOR DIFFERENT PHASE OF A CCP EVENT  Methodology focus Information System Support Pre-CCP ? Identify and invite parties which will contribute to the  idea generation process.

Actual users seem to perform much better than the professional participants and are more willing to post ideas and thought to the discussion boards.

The event was held between 3/19/2012 12:00pm and 3/22 12:00pm, during which 735 people generated 3180 articles.

Three discussion boards were setup, and board admins will post different set of topics on to them during the event: ? Reading Digitally and Life Style: general experience  sharing about both electronic and paper-based reading.

Topics starting from paper-based reading experience and gradually transformed into digital reading specific discussion  ? Digital Publishing Industry Professional Topics: ecosystem and industrial specific discussions, aims for experts but also welcome Q&As from end users  ? Innovative Idea Garden: prize will be given to the top articles related to specific topic. Topics for article submission include fictional E-Reading device use case, and proposed usage of existing E-Ink device.

To our surprise, although the Innovative Idea garden was  created for competition purpose, a lot of follow-up articles still appeared and some meaning discussions surfaced. This  shows that in the CCP event the participants are really engaged in the discussion and not only cared about monetary rewards.

B. Keywords  The most important keywords identified by the system and filtered by the CCP event committee are as below:   TABLE 3. MOST FREQUENTLY APPEARED KEYWORDS IDENTIFIED.

Keyword Frequency 1 Reading 1669 2 Digital 1132 3 E-Book 1062 4 E-Reader 851 5 Paper-based 583 6 Computer 578 7 Book 518 8 Mobile Phone 380 9 Traditional 350 10 Tablet 352 11 Internet 344 12 Digitize 260 13 Novel 225 14 Function 225 15 Free 210         Illustration 3. Keyword Cloud in Chinese   2013 Proceedings of PICMET '13: Technology Management for Emerging Technologies.

From the analysis of keyword we can clearly see that there?s massive interaction regarding the topic of paper-based/traditional reading versus digital reading, and the comparison of different reading device include e-ink readers, cellphones, tablets and computers. Due to the participation of different interest groups, there are many participants in this CCP event who are unfamiliar with the technology. Those participants actually contribute a lot to the discussion due to their lack of knowledge about digital reading.  Since digital reading in Taiwan has yet to be adopted widely by the public, to identify why people don?t use it is just as important as what people like about it.

C. Co-occurrence Analysis  In this section we?ll introduce the concept of co-occurrence analysis, and why it is very useful to analyze massive amount of participant-posted articles. Co-occurrence analysis has been used in informatics [2] and communications research [8]. Co-occurrence network is built up by examining paired occurrences of keywords in a post. With each paired occurrrence of keywords their relationship value is added by one, forming a network between all the keywords/concept from a group of data. Aside from serving as a tool to represent the structure of a group of contents, co-occurrence netowrk has been also used to enhance other data processing tasks such as modifying search results [13], to identify keywords from a document [10], or to index documents [1].

In CCP, we also use co-occurrence as a mean to analyze and aggregate articles before further examination on the actual article content. From the keyword analysis we would get a list of important keywords in this event. After that the system can automatically pair those important terms together and calculate the frequency of co-occurrence, and then proceed to show their relationships visually. Before we put the keywords in Table 3 into co-occurrence analysis, some additional keywords that is important but did not appear frequently enough are added manually after reviewed by the committee. As in Table 4:  TABLE 4. MANUALLY ADDED KEYWORDS FOR CO-OCCURRENCE  ANALYSIS Keyword Frequency 1 Book Rental Store 33 2 Children 150 3 Bookstore 146 4 Library 151 5 School 95 6 Pirated Books 96 7 Commute 50   In Table 4 there?re some important concepts which we  hoped to receive more feedback in the discussion process.

Although the frequency of the keywords may not as high as the keywords in Table 3, after looking into the contents of the article we found that there?s indeed a lot of information we need in those articles.

From Table 3 and Table 4, the system indentifies each  combination of keywords, and then proceeds to calculate the frequency of each co-occurred keyword pair. The board admins can also get a list of articles which contains the particular pair of co-occurred keywords, and browse through the articles to see what they can find.

Through the help of co-occurrence analysis, some interesting keyword pairs emerged. Below is a brief summary of some interesting keyword pairs and the insights after reading the article clusters:  1. Ebook ? Computer, co-occurrence frequency: 162  Articles which contain those two keywords mostly illustrate personal experience regarding reading ebooks on a computer. The opinion on reading an E-Book using a computer is bipolar. The pro camp are very used to stare at computer screens for long hours, and thinks that computer screen is really the best when it comes to E-Book reading compared to other small screen device. On the other hand some participants think it particularly unconformable to read a book on a computer for extended period. This also fits the context of Taiwanese digital reading industry as many pioneer companies promote computers as the main reading device when they first developed the platform.

Tablets are regarded as the better devices to read digitally in these discussions, working as a compromise of computer and handheld devices such as cellphone. E-Ink readers were left out in this discussion due to the lack of familiarity among ordinary end users.

2. E-book ? Cellphone, co-occurrence frequency: 83  Just like the previous pair of keywords, from the discussion we found that a lot of people in Taiwan are also using cellphone to read digitally. Multi-function device such as a cellphone that can provide music-playing and Ebook-reading functions are very popular in the Asian region.

They might not be too good for every application they are used for, but it is always cheaper and more convenient to have all functions on a single device. The main complain of reading on a cellphone is the inadequate font size, but it is indeed the most convenient way to do some short reading when one commutes. But there?re also some participants indicates that due to the eye constrain caused, reading on a cellphone will not become the mainstream ---- people will go back to paper-based reading sooner or later.

3. E-Book ? the Internet, co-occurrence frequancy: 122  Right at the start of this event the definition of digital reading has been challenged. Many users point out that it?s not digital reading that needs to be promoted. The fact that ?reading? is being challenged by so many alternative media such as television, social network websites and so on might render the debate of digital reading obsolete. Mobile applications such as flipboard begins to mimic the look and feel of a book, but filled the ?book? dynamically with contents from social network. It might be a problem that both paper-based and digitized book vendors have to solve   2013 Proceedings of PICMET '13: Technology Management for Emerging Technologies.

together before they declare war to each other with copyright arguments.

4. E-book ? Fiction, co-occurrence frequency: 66  In these discussions the focus is which type of paper-based books are suitable for transformation into E-books. The consensus is that fictions and magazines are more suitable to sell online due their fast-consumed nature.

The current sales figure on the E-Book platforms also supports this, reflecting the fact that E-Book user population is highly overlapped with the active Internet users. However this also indicates E-Book right now are in direct competition to the ?new media? as mentioned, vendors might have to try to seek for other market segmentation to avoid this.

Also, when a user wants to ?keep? a book, he will choose the paper-based version over the electronic version --- the E-Books are only for short term reading purpose so it won?t sell if the price tag is the same as a paper-based book. The meaning of a book includes the ability to be shared, to be put on a bookshelf for decorative purposes and so on. Coupled with the discussion of paper-based book vs. E-Book, the vendor needs to reconsider its value proposition to give the customers a better sense of value, or the customers might stick to paper-based books for a long while.

5. Bookstore ? Library, co-occurrence frequency: 49  Articles contain those keywords mostly focused on the source of E-Books. The participants who posted those articles have a more conservative attitude towards digital reading.

From those articles we can see that some of the heavy readers are more or less still in favor of paper-based reading. The digital industry in Taiwan tries hard to convert paper-based readers into digital readers, but put relatively less effort to convert Internet heavy users into E-Book users. As stated above, this is a dilemma that the E-Book platform has to solve. If they can?t attract paper-based book readers or Internet users, then they must create whole new market segmentation or this industry will not grow any further.

6. E-Book ? Paper-based Book, co-occurrence frequency: 89  Finally, this is the series of articles that are closely related to E-Ink reader. It is interesting to see that people that are really used to paper-based reading gives good comment about E-Ink readers. This is no surprise as the E-Ink readers provide much similar experience to paper-based books, and also the paper-based book lovers tend to be less Internet addicted. But the main concern still arises from the copyright issues of E-Book. A user cannot freely sell and exchange books with friends, and the worry that when an E-Book platform cease to operate all the books would be gone is a major negative factor for technology adoption. The fact that E-Book is being licensed and not ?sold? to the customers is not really helpful for the paper-electronic conversion of those paper-based book lovers. There?s really only one major E-Ink device brand here in Taiwan. It seems that E-Ink based platform indeed possesses a better position to attract the paper-based book  lovers, provided that the above problems can be solved.

Co-occurrence analysis tells a much more complete story  about the discussion dynamics of the CCP event than a simple keyword analysis. When a group of articles contain two or more core concepts in a particular discussion, the board admins can easily track down the trend of the articles.

Sometimes the discussions were bipolar, and sometimes there?s strong consensus among the articles, either way there?ll be strong implication to be extracted from those discussions.

Sometimes the original post is not that appealing, but the follow-ups are much more worth reading. This demonstrates the power of a well designed online brainstorming process versus ordinary web forums.

Once users are engaged in the event, he will come back and post random thoughts that come across his mind during the event.

IV. CONCLUSION   This paper introduces the Creative Concerto Platform and the follow-up co-occurrence analysis process and its result.

The case study of ?digital publishing industry innovation? event shows that with carefully designed and implemented methodology, even a relatively smaller group of people (hundreds versus IBM JAM?s thousands) can generate a lot of thoughts and ideas for a particular topic in a relatively short time span. On average each participant actually contributed more than 4 posts in this event.

Co-occurrence, compared to simple keyword analysis, provided some valuable information regarding the event.

Articles that are grouped by co-occurrence analysis contain similar combination of concepts, therefore it?s easier for the board admins to browse and compare articles, and to extract ideas and inferences in the process. Quite some information with strategic implication emerged in the process, and can be forwarded to the industry for further examination and verification.

According to the post event interview with the E-Book platform vendor that co-hosted this event, some of the results are as expected: such as the need to increase number of E-Book for purchase by the customers, and the high usage of cellphone as an E-Book reading device. Some unexpected results include the opinions regarding PC as a very viable E-Book reading platform, and that the E-Ink technology are still fairly unknown to most paper-based book lovers in Taiwan. The latter is quite striking as the co-host of this event also manufacture and sell E-Ink reader in Taiwan, and often think that end users are well aware of this technology. After the CCP the company will expand more resource into educating the users in Taiwan about E-Ink technology.



V. DISCUSSION   There?re several aspects of CCP that can still be improved, including methodology and information systems ones.

First, to conduct effective keyword analysis and co-occurrence analysis in Chinese, it is very important to have a good dictionary or API that can extract terms properly, preferably giving proper weight to each term for effective advanced analysis. So far there?s no good open term extraction API around in Taiwan. In the future we?ll need to work with search engines / research institutes to deal with this problem. The better the term extraction mechanism, the less human resource will be needed to complete the analysis.

And it?s clear in this case study that to have heterogeneous participants is a critical success factor to a CCP event.

Sometimes the recruiting cost is a little bit pricey if professional marketing agencies are involved in the recruiting process, and may be too expensive for SMBs to deploy.

Organizations with an established member base are the most suitable candidates to hold CCP events, but for small  businesses that also want to seek for new ideas from crowd sourcing, the only way maybe to work with other similar SMBs to share the recruiting cost.

A possible solution to this is to build up a public ?brain power bank?. Public organizations such as the government, universities, and unions can all play a role in this process.

With proper design the organizations can motivate its members to participate in brainstorming activities and get some form of return in the process, and the SMBs who want to leverage the power of crowd sourcing will have an affordable source of potential participants.
