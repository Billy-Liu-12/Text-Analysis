MAMMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION ANALYSIS THROUGH  ASSOCIATION-RULE MINING

Abstract The increasing availability of large clinical and  biomedical data repositories provides researchers with substantial opportunities for data analysis and knowledge discovery. Data mining is an expanding research fiontier that provides numerous eficient and scalable methods to extract patterns of interest in datasets. The University of Calgaly Atlas of mammograms (U of C Atlas) contains digital mammographic images and textual reports of radiologists acquired f iom Screen Test Alberta. Many advanced image-processing techniques have been applied to the images in this dataset. However, research has not been conducted to take advantage of data-mining techniques, which motivates us to investigate the finctionalip of association-rule mining techniques to discover patterns of interest in the existing dataset.

This paper describes preliminary results of the application of applying association-rule mining techniques to the U of C Atlas. We propose a new breast mass classijkation method based on quantitative association-rule mining. The experiments conducted on the U of C Atlas show that many interesting rules can be generated ji-om this dataset, and indicate previously unobserved patterns in the information contained in the atlas.

1. INTRODUCTION  Breast cancer will affect one in nine Canadian women during their lifetime [l]. The detection and classification of breast abnormalities as benign or malignant may be achieved with mammography. The University of Calgary Atlas of digitized mammograms (U of C Atlas) contains 100 malignant, 50 benign, and 50 normal cases, totaling 1745 images acquired during the  time period of 1990 to 2000 by Screen Test Alberta centres (Alberta Program for the Early Detection of Breast Cancer [ 11) located in Calgary and Edmonton, and by mobile units in rural AIberta. In addition to the digital mammographic images, complete patient information in the form of clinical, mammographic, and pathology reports is also provided [2]. The atlas provides a comprehensive source for data analysis and knowledge discovery. From this dataset, 57 regions (20 malignant and 37 benign) in mammograms containing masses have been extracted and intensively examined. Three shape factors representing compactness, fractional concavity, and spiculation index were computed for use as indices for each of the mass regions [2, 31. This preliminary investigation into data mining is based on these shape feature values.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The association-rule mining method applied to the U of C Atlas for pattern discovery is introduced in Section 2. In Section 3, an overview of the association-rule-based system is presented, and details are provided on how the system was designed and implemented. The experimental results obtained are described in Section 4. In the last section, we summarize our work and discuss some future possibilities.

2. ASSOCIATION-RULE MINING  Since its introduction in 1993, the method of association-rule mining has received a great deal of attention. Today, the mining of such rules is still one of the most popular pattern-discovery methods [4].

Association-rule mining is a data-mining task that is used to discover relationships among items in a transactional database [5]. In brief, an association rule is an expression X Y, where X and Y are sets of items. The meaning of such rules is quite intuitive. Given a database D of transactions where each transaction T E D is a set of items, X 3 Y expresses that whenever a transaction T  CCECE 2004- CCGEI 2004, Niagara Falls, May/mai 2004 0-7803-8253-6/04/$17.00 02004 IEEE  - 1495 -    contains X, then T probably contains Y also; The following key parameters are used to evaluate  the generated association rules: support and confidence.

SUPPORT - The support of an association rule is  the ratio (in percent) of the records that condin {X, Y} to the total number of records in the database: support (X SY) = Prob{XuY}.

CONFIDENCE - For a given number of records, the confidence is the ratio of the number of records that contain {X, Y} to the number of records that contain X: confidence (X a y )  = Prob { Y( X} = ( support (XUY) ) /  STRONG ASSOCIATION RULES - Rules that satisfy both a minimum support threshold (min-sup) and a minimum confidence threshold (min-con0 are called strong rules. Strong rules are the key elements obtained from an analysis of all possible rules.

Among the best-known algorithms for association- rule induction is the Apriori algorithm [5, 61. In our system, we used the Apriori algorithm in order to discover association rules among the shape features extracted from the mammographic mass regions.

3. SYSTEM DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION  In the system developed, we used quantitative association-rule mining based on the Apriori algorithm in order to discover association rules between the features extracted from the mammographic database and the classification to which each mammogram belongs as determined by biopsy. In other words, a rule would describe frequent sets of features per 4 classification (benign or malignant) based on the association-rule discovery algorithm.

3.1 Feature Extraction  Three shape measures of compactness (C), fractional concavity (Fee), and spiculation index (So were used to represent the diagnostic characteristics of masses in mammograms [2, 3, 71. These measures have been found to be effective in the discrimination of masses as being benign or malignant.

1. The normalized form of compactness, C, is a simple measure of shape complexity, and is computed as  4 z A  C=l - - P2  where A is the area and P is the perimeter of the contour.

2. Fractional concavity Fcc is the ,ratio of the  cumulative length of the concave portions of the contour to the total length of the contour.

3. Spiculation index SI represents the degree of spicularity of a mass contour. Rangayyan et al. [3]  proposed an algorithm to compute SI based upon a polygonal model of the given contour and a combination of the segment lengths, base widths, and angles of possible spicules.

3.2 Generation of Associations by Quantitative Association-Rule Mining  3.2.1 Data preparation. The association-rule mining algorithm requires variables with Boolean attributes, whereas in our system, the feature values are all quantitative, real values. We use a method where the problem of mining quantitative association rules is mapped into a Boolean association-rule problem [8].

Each of the shape features extracted is numerically in the range [O.O,  1.01. Each feature is split into 10 ranges as [O.O, 0.11, [0.1, 0.21, ..., [0.9, 1.01, and intervals are defined for each feature Fi as Rangemin I Fi <Rangemax.

For example, the feature SI = 0.82 belongs to the new feature interval [Rangemin = 0.8, Rangemax = 0.91.

The new feature intervals are organized in the form of transactions, which in turn constitute the input for the data-mining and classification algorithms. The transactions are of the form {Class Label, F1, Fz, . . ., F?}, where F1, Fz, . . ., F, are the features extracted for a given mammographic mass image, and Class Label is the discrimination of the mass as being benign or malignant.

The following are samples of feature interval transactions: { Benign, CO.l-0.2, FO.O-O.1,SO.O-O.1 } { Benign, CO.l-0.2, FO.0-0.1, SO.0-0.1 }  {Malignant, C0.4-0.5,FO.3-0.4, SO.l-0.2  Here, F = Fcc, and S = SI.

3.2.2 Pruning methods. After the association-rule mining algorithm is applied, many rules are generated.

However, we might not be interested in all the rules generated. Pruning methods need to be employed to identify the rules that represent knowledge in a useful manner [4].

1. The major constraint could be that only those rules that could be used further for classification are to be considered. Given the transaction model X Y, we are interested in rules of the form Y is Ci (Classification Type: Benign or Malignant). Such rules are called ?interesting rules?.

2. The probabilities and joint probabilities of items and combinations of interest are evaluated to provide thresholds based on their support or confidence values. In our algorithm, the term ?strong rules? is applied to interesting rules that have support 2 5% and confidence 2 80%.

4. PRELIMINARY RESULTS  We explored the association rules between the three features of shape [C, Fcc, SA and the clinical classifications of masses. The rules were generated in the order of single-feature rules representing associations between each feature and the mass classification, as well as two- and three-feature rules representing associations between different combinations of features and the mass classification. After the association rules were generated, pruning methods were used to discover the interesting and strong rules that represent significant knowledge.

The association rules discovered were evaluated in terms of the confidence in their effectiveness in classifying the masses as benign or malignant.

4.1 Association Rules Discovered  Fig. 1 shows the association rules of single shape features that were discovered.

The interesting single-feature rules discovered indicate that, for compactness, if the value is between 0.1 and 0.2, the mass is benign with 100% confidence. If the value of C is between 0.2 and 0.3, then the mass is most likely benign (66.7% confidence), and if the'value is between 0.4 and 0.5 or 0.6 and 1 .O, the mass is malignant with 100% confidence. However, if the value of C is between 0.5 and 0.6, the result is ambiguous, and the mass could be benign or malignant with equal  confidence. Single-feature rules for fractional concavity indicate that if the value is less than 0.4, the mass is most likely benign, whereas if the value is greater than 0.4, the mass is malignant with 100% confidence. For the spiculation index, if the value is less than 0.2, the mass is most likely benign, and if the value is greater than 0.2, the mass is malignant with 100% confidence.

Table 1. Summary of association rules discovered in the U of C Atlas.

Average  used rules' One 175 94.1  The feature values were evaluated using the measure of confidence for their effectiveness in classifying masses as benign or malignant. The three shape features F,,, C, and SI yielded average confidence of 94.7%, 93.0% and 94.7%, respectively.

Two- and three-feature rules provided better classification accuracy than single-feature rules. This trend is shown in Table 1, which summarizes the number of rules generated and the interesting or strong rules discovered in each case. With more features involved, the average confidence increases; however, the support for each rule decreases as the number of transactions that meet the criteria gets smaller.

4.2 Classifying a New Mass  The rules that withstood the pruning phase represent the patterns existing in the U of C Atlas. Strong rules represent the most valuable patterns; interesting rules with lower support or confidence also give valuable reference for classifying a new mass. These associations with features and diagnostic classification can be used to predict the class to which new mass regions are to be attached.

Given a new mass to classify, the shape features discussed in Section 3.1 are extracted. The classification of a new mass is the class label of the strong rule with the most confidence and support that the features of the new mass match. The sequence to search a rule that the new features would match is outlined in Fig. 2. The sequence is searched in the order of accuracy: the rules with higher  - 1497 -    C j i - G G G S 3  I Three-feature strong rules I n  Two-feature strong rules I  I Single-feature strong rules I a  Three-feature interesting rules  Fig. 2.

accuracy are searched first. If the features of the new mass fail the single-feature strong-rule matching step, the interesting rules with lower accuracy and support are searched. Three-feature interesting rules are examined, since they cover all the possibilities of combination of the three shape features. If the features do not match any of the strong rules or interesting rules, then the algorithm must degrade gracefully. This implies that when no matches occur, existing, non-data-mining algorithms will be used to classify such a mass.
