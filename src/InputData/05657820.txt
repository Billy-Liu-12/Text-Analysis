Abstract Nowadays, Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is becoming a hot topic after the ?Sensor China? concept proposed in 2009. Sensor nodes are deployed in a hostile or unattended environment to collect the data information. Therefore, network security has become a big problem. A new key management scheme of security network architecture for wireless sensor network is presented in this paper. The proposed key management mechanism combines trusted-server scheme and key pre-distribution scheme which meets the security requirements of WSN. We also illustrate the new network architecture for wireless sensor network and a typical communication process between two sensor nodes to describe the design idea and implementation. Finally, we analyses the system security and performance of WSN. The results demonstrate the proposed scheme could obtain more shared key and reduce large amount of computations.

Keywords: wireless sensor network (WSN), security, key management scheme  1  Introduction Recently, Wireless Sensor Network has becoming a hot technological topic with the development of computer science and wireless communication technology, especially after the ?Smart Planet? concept which was proposed by IBM in 2009 and ?Internet of Things? concept in China. WSN (Wireless Sensor Network) means an environment composed of large-scale micro devices which are called sensor nodes [1]. These sensor nodes are battery-constrained, have limited storage memory and computational processing capacity, because they usually need to work many years. Sensor nodes consist of many functions of monitoring a wide variety of surrounding conditions and collecting important data, including magnet, temperature and so on.

When sensor nodes are deployed in a hostile environment, adversaries can easily listen to the traffic between nodes and intentionally provide  misleading information to other nodes. So how to guarantee the security in WSN is becoming especially important. The main idea is how to set up secret keys between nodes. This problem is known as the key agreement problem. There are three types of general key agreement schemes: trusted-server scheme, self-enforcing scheme, and key pre- distribution scheme [2].

The self-enforcing scheme depends on asymmetric cryptography, which uses public key algorithms such as RSA [3] or Diffie-Hellman [4]. However, it is not practical to use public key algorithms, due to limited storage and computation resources. This paper presents key agreement scheme which is a hybrid between trusted-server scheme and key pre- distribution scheme. Here we quote the efficient key pre-distribution scheme which is Hui-Feng Huang [5] proposed in 2007. Compared to Choi and Youn [6, 7] proposed key pre-distribution scheme, this scheme can reduce large amounts of computations and communications for both the key pre-distribution step.

This paper is organized as follows. Section 1 introduces the present situation of WSN. Section 2 shows the new network architecture of WSN that we proposed. Section 3 presents some works includes the proposed key agreement scheme and a typical communication process between two nodes. Section 4 shows the security analyses and the performances of the proposed scheme. Section 5 draws a conclusion.

2  New network architecture of WSN The traditional network architecture of WSN is self- organized and flat, so it is not easy to centralized monitor all the devices operation. This paper proposes the new network architecture of WSN, as shown in Figure. 1. It introduces the idea of central control and helps us grasp the network conditions in WSN.

___________________________________       Figure 1 Network Architecture of WSN  It contains lots of sensor nodes, several small base stations, one big base station, one trusted server and one person monitor system. Here we can also set up a firewall to prevent inner WSN from outer Internet attacks.

In order to reduce the production cost of WSN, it is practical to lower the process capacity of each sensor node and let trusted server implement the complex computation and key management scheme. Inside the WSN, we can define one cluster including one small base station and all sensor nodes it covers.

The sensor nodes, which detect and gather data information from environment, are scattered in the sensor field. They are connected by low power radio link. Data are routed back to the base station by multi-hop principle. The small base station can receive data from local sensor nodes and send information to them. It can also communicate with other small base stations by high bandwidth radio link. All the small base stations are wireless linked to the big base station which can broadcast information to all the small base stations. The trusted server stores all the private keys and shared key of devices in WSN. In order to prevent eavesdroppers from disclosing the private key, here we use wired link to connect trusted server and big base station. At last person monitor system can help us to monitor the operation and broadcast information to all the devices in WSN. Any event, including broken devices, collected data information and etc, will appear on the monitor?s screen.

3  Related works This section presents the proposed key management scheme and a typical communication process between two sensor nodes.

3.1 Proposed key management scheme  Here we propose a new key management scheme which combines trusted-server scheme and key pre- distribution scheme. Hui-Feng Huang [5] proposed an efficient key pre-distribution scheme in 2007,  which guarantees any pair of sensor nodes can find a common private key with simple computation. Based on this scheme, we add a trusted-server to this scheme which can store private key table of all devices, shared key matrix and generate messages which imply shared key between two nodes. In order to enhance the security, the proposed approach is to map the used shared key to another one and replace it.

Once shared key is chosen by trusted server, it will be mapped to another one which doses not exist in the shared key matrix. If the trusted server chooses the same key afterwards, instead of using the same key as the previous one, it will derive a new different key by mapping the original key.

Supposing there are a number of n neighborhood sensor nodes ? ?1 2, ,..., nN N N and one small base station in one cluster. For each cluster, the trusted server assigned two tables. One contains private key of each sensor node and small base station, and the other contains shared key matrix of all sensor nodes in this cluster. The private key is permanently store in the sensor node or base station when it is manufactured, and you can only use it but don?t know what it is. It seems like USB key of ICBC.

The scheme is based on the linear combination [8] and details are as follows: 1)First, the trusted server randomly chooses a positive integer t and a base of form? ?2 11, , ,....., nt t t ? 2)The trusted server generates a shared key matrix of sensor nodes, that is  ? ? ,  , ,  , ,  , 1   ,  ,    i j  i j n n i j  i j j i  i j k this figure does not make any sense  K k i j k is the shared key between  nodes and k k t  ?  ? ?    ? ? ?   ? ?  .

Here, there is no need to assign ,i ik a meaningful value, because within our key management scheme, the diagonal elements will not be assigned to sensor node as shared public key.

3)The trusted server could construct the secret message iS of the form  2 1 ,1 ,2 ,3 ,...

n i i i i i nS k k t k t k t  ?? ? ? ? ? for 1,2,... ,i n? by using n distinct secret keys  ,1 ,2 ,, ,...,i i i nk k k .The big base station transmits the secret message iS to specific small base station, and then transmits iS to all the sensor nodes in this cluster. Follows the same procedure, jS could also be sent to nodes.

4)For the two communication nodes iN and jN could compute     , 1 mod i  i j j  Sk t t ? ? ?? ? ?? ?  and , 1 mod j  j i i  S k t  t ? ? ?  ? ? ? ? ?  respectively. Thus , ,i j j ik k? is a shared private key between iN and jN , here the expression of  i  j  S t ? ? ? ? ?? ?  is the largest integer less than or equal  to 1 i  j  S t ?  .

5)Finally, the shared key ,i jk , ,j ik  will be mapped to another one which does not exist in the shared key matrix. It can prevent eavesdroppers from disclosing the shared key matrix and enhance the security of WSN.

3.2 A typical communication process  This section presents a typical communication process between two sensor nodes. Assuming that node A and node B are neighbors, if node A wants to communicate with node B, the main communication process is shown in Figure.2.

Figure 2 Main Communication Process between Node A and B  In order to describe the communication process more clearly, first we define some symbols. Table 1 displays the notation used in this scheme.

Table 1 Notation used in this scheme Notion Description  iID the identify number of node i ? ?H one-way hash function  ik the private key that only owned by node itself and don?t allow external access. You can only use it but don?t know what it is  ' ik the key that is ? ?  ' i ik H k?  ijk shared secret key that used between two nodes ijM The original request message that represents node i want to  communicate to node j. and ijM  must meet the prescribed form ' ijM the encrypted request message that represents node i want to  communicate to node j  iS secret information that server sends to node i ? ?kE the symmetric encryption function using key k ? ?kD the symmetric decryption function using key k t r is a random positive integer and r  is bigger than node size The following details will describe the steps that both nodes will take in establishing a secure communication process 1. Supposing that node A attempts to communicate  with node B, firstly, node A broadcasts hello message to the base station which can deliver the message to the trusted server.

2. Node A computes the encryption key ? ?'i ik H k? .

Here we use the SHA-2 algorithm as hash function.

Because the popular hash function MD5 (Message Digest algorithm 5) and SHA-1 are considered not entirely secured and may have some security threat [10] [11] [12].

3. Using the encryption key 'ik , node A can encrypt the original request message ijM to be  ' ijM .

Here ijM is the original request message that represents node i want to communicate to node j and must meet the prescribed form. We have to use symmetric cryptography algorithm due to limited capacity of storage and computation.

4. Node A transmits 'ijM and it?s iID to the base station which can deliver the message to the trusted server.

5. Searching the private key table of all devices, the trusted server can find the private key ik by iID .

After that trusted server uses the same hash function to calculate decryption key 'ik and decrypts out plaintext ijM .

6. The trusted server could construct the secret message iS , jS by using secret keys  , , for , 1, 2,...i jk i j n? .The base station transmits the secret message iS , jS to sensor node A and B  7. Using the formula , 1 mod i  i j j  Sk t t ?  ? ?? ? ?? ? and  , 1 mod j  j i i  S k t  t ? ? ?  ? ? ? ? ?  , node A and node B can  compute shared key ijk and jik , obviously, ij jik k? . And then, node A and node B     will send ACK message to the trusted server. After receiving two ACK messages, the trusted server will transmit ACK message to node A and B.

From now on, node A can transmit data information to node B.

8. Currently, the node A could encrypt the data with the shared key ijk using symmetric cryptography algorithm and transmits it to node B.

9. Node B could decrypt the data with the shared key jik using the same symmetric cryptography algorithm. And then, node B will send Finished message to node A.

10.After receiving Finished message, node A could send Finished message to node B.

If all the steps finished, a typical communication process between two sensor nodes finished. Figure 3 summarizes the total communication process.

Figure 3 Typical Communication Process between Node A and B  4  Security analyses and performances of the proposed scheme  4.1 Security analyses  The security of this key management scheme is based on hash function, private key and the trusted server.

In this paper, we choose SHA-2 algorithm as hash function which is considered to have preimage resistant and collision resistant property. If given the output 'k , it is hard to find any k such that ? ?'k H k? .Furthermore, it should be hard to find two different messages 1 2,k k such that ? ? ? ?1 2H k H k? .

The private key is permanently embedded in the sensor node when it is manufactured, and you can only use it but don?t know what it is. It seems like USB key of ICBC. This mechanism makes sure that any adversary cannot derive the private key.

Assuming that one forged sensor node attempts to communicate with node B, if two nodes receive security message iS and jS , by  using , 1 mod i  i j j  Sk t t ? ? ?? ? ?? ?  , we can calculate , ,i j j ik k? .

Although the forged node receives the encrypted data using encryption key ,i jk , it can?t decrypted data using different key ,j ik . Therefore, this scheme is secure.

People can monitor all events happened in WSN, and the trusted server is totally controlled by person.

Obviously, it can help us centralized control devices working properly. Therefore, the trusted server must be deployed to the person monitor system where only administrator can maintain it. The shared key matrix is only access by trusted server. Furthermore, if the shared key ,i jk is used before, it will be mapped to another one which does not exist in the shared key matrix to enhance the security. Without knowing iS and t, the attacker cannot derive the shared key ,i jk between nodes iN and jN .

All these mechanism can make sure the scheme is secure.

4.2 Performances of the proposed scheme  Compared to Huang?s key management scheme, the proposed scheme could have more shared private keys to use. So assuming that there exist a number of n neighborhood sensor nodes, the shared key matrix is n n? real symmetric matrix that means ij jik k? . Within our key management scheme,  there is no need to assign ,i ik a meaningful value, because the diagonal elements will not be assigned to two sensor nodes as shared public key. So Huang?s  key management scheme has  n n? available shared  keys to choose. However, my proposed scheme could  have  n n? available shared keys to choose and has  n  more shared keys than Huang?s scheme. For example, when 60n ? , Huang?s scheme has 1770 keys to choose, but my proposed scheme has 1830 keys to choose.

Figure 4 shows the comparison of available shared key number between Huang?s scheme and my proposed scheme. The results of Figure 4 show that     the proposed scheme has more shared keys than Huang?s scheme with the number of sensor nodes is from 20 to 100. As a result, this enables to obtain more shared keys to choose for communication.

Obviously, it?s difficult for eavesdroppers to crack the shared private key, and this scheme could enhance the security of WSN.

Figure 4 Comparison of Available Shared Key Number between Huang?s Scheme and the Proposed Scheme with the Number of Sensor Nodes is from 20 to 100  Compared this scheme to Youn al.?s scheme [8] [9] scheme. For convenience, I just give simple description of his comparison. You can find detailed analysis in Hui-Feng Huang?s paper [7]. Here we defines mT is the time for one multiplication computation; dT is the time for one modular division computation. Assuming that there exist a number of n neighborhood nodes? ?1 2, ,..., nN N N in a designated area. We select ? ?2 11, , ,....., nt t t ? as the base of expression. The value of it can be pre-computed and stored in the storage memory.

For the key pre-distribution step, the computational complexity of this scheme is 2 mn T , in contrast, Youn al.?s scheme is ? ? ? ?3 2m dO n T O n T? . For computing a common key for any pair of nodes, the computational complexity of Youn al.?s scheme is ? ? mO n T , while this scheme is only dT , it is obvious that this scheme can reduce large amount of computations.

5  Conclusions This paper proposed a new design of security wireless sensor network using efficient key management scheme. We have introduced the new system architecture of WSN, key management scheme and a typical communication process between two nodes. The trusted-server is regarded as the third trusted authority which restore private key and shared key of all sensor nodes. SHA-2 algorithm is used as hash function to generate the encryption key. All these can make sure the security of WSN.

Finally, we analyses the system security and performance of WSN.
