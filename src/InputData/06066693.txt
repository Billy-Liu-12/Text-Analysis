I.  INTRODUCTION A lot of new intrusion detection systems served a  signature-depended method that intrusions were figured out through assigning every input event that was different from the defined signatures in advance that model malicious activity. The merit of signature-based method was the real thing that they could figure out intrusions with an allowed correctness and they inclined to formed fewer alarms than their anomaly-depended cousins. The intrusion detection system was ready to supplement and simplicity to allocation, particularly in a big production networks. Therefore many commercial systems and a lot of deployed installations applied signature-depended detection.

Computer security was a progressively critical problem, principally in light of the striking improvement in the number of computers timelessly linked with the network.

Some relative scientists put forward a great deal of advanced methods about the intrusion detection of network. Research in the field concluded thinking coming from the bioinformatics. Simultaneously, a lot of applied research for the statistical detectors and theoretical probabilistic research was carried out by some scientists. Assessing intrusion detection systems was a hard work because of the following reasons [1].

(1) It was ambiguous to collect a lot of data with high quality for carrying out the estimate for hideaway and rivaling ideas.

(2) Although the actual lively data was acquired, labeling network joints as normal or intrusions needs a lot of time for a large number of human experts.

(3) The steady change of the network traffic could not only depict the new kinds of intrusions but could also transfer the respects of the ?normal? activity.

(4) When evaluating the characteristic of an intrusion detection system, it was important to valuate not only the velocity of the system, but also the number of mistake alarm, as well as the capital of misclassification

II. INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM The aim of the intrusion detection was to measure the  activity of the intrusion; it collected and analyzed several point information of the computer network or computer system, and checked whether the network or system existing the trace and activity that was against the security strategies.

The combination of software and hardware of intrusion detection was the intrusion detection system. The technology of intrusion technology could was divided into the following kinds: the detection based on main computer, the detection based on network, the detection based on inter-core, the detection based on application [2]. The model of intrusion detection system was showed in Figure 1.

III. DATA MINING TECHNOLOGY (1) The basic conception of the data mining Data mining was a procession of extracting inter,  unknown by people in advance, useful information and knowledge from the many, uncompleted, noise, ambiguous actual application data. The procession of data mining was made up of three main stages: data preparation, data mining, results express and interpret. The main technology used by data mining was listed as follows: association rule classify rule, Collection analysis and series mode.

(a) Association analysis Association rule was a technology that analyzed the  associative relation among the data, and the relation of different characteristic of a record through mining the association rule of original data, and the depending relation among many characteristic that satisfied a certain support degree and confidence degree. In the network security system the correlation of different intrusion activity for invader was found out using the association analysis [2].

Form description of association rule was listed as follows: },,,{ 21 mIIIR =  was defined as a group data set,  W was a group item set. Each item T of W was a group data item and the condition of RT ?  was satisfied. A data set item X and an item T was assumed to exist, if the condition of TX ? was satisfied, and the item T supported the data item set X ,  The association rule could be depicted as a data discovered rule, which was expressed as follows:  YX ?                                                                          (1) where X  and Y were two group data items,  TX ? , TY ? , ?=YX .

Support degree and confidence degree of depicting association rule could be defined as follows:  sup   )()( YXPYXport =?                             (2) )|()( XYPYXconfidence =?                             (3)  Support degree was a measurement of importance of association rule, because the rule with lower support degree may occasionally happen. Support degree had a characteristic of expectancy, which was used to find the association rule effectively. Confidence degree was a measurement of correctness of association rule,. For the given rule YX ? , the reliability of Y existing in the item including X would increase when the confidence enhanced.

Confidence degree offered the evaluation of condition probability of Y when X was given [2].

b Series analysis The aim of series analysis was to find out the longitudinal  correlation of different data record. It was important to consider the frequency series mode of events during the process of intrusion detection model, the main reason was that sometime a series of events by intrusion activities including the single event that suit for the normal model, the intrusion activity could be confirmed through analyzing the relationship among a series of events. Therefore frequency series found out could make us know a lot of performance of relating system activity or client activity.

The objective of series analysis was to mine the large sequences from the event database, and satisfy the frequency series required by minimum support degree by client, and this series mode should be maximum series.

(d) Classify analysis The aim of data classification was to extract the  performance of data item in the database, and the classify model was produced, and this model could make data of database into one of given classification. In intrusion detection, the intrusion classify could be carried out according to all kinds of criteria, classify analysis detect the past intrusion activity, and the description of every kind of classify could be given according to the classificatory criteria.



IV. DATA MINING MODEL  Let ),( tt yxX = , Nt ,,2,1= be a training sample of observations where tx is a l dimensional vector of attributes,  ty was the signal in a express method of m-dimensional  vector with positive unites: }1,0{?ty , 1  = =  N  i tiy  As a base, a reasonably economical technique named Leader Algorithm in this research was applied, and later was applied in application to the intrusion detection. The following below Algorithm 1 has two significant differences comparing with Leader Algorithm. Firstly, the Algorithm 1 uses flexible centroids (instead of permanent leaders), which will be recomputed after any change of the corresponding cluster. Secondly, the Algorithm 1 will be used in application to the labeled data, and we would be interested to make clusters uniform in the terms of labels. Respectively, we will apply special regularization R  in (1) and (2), which should be powerful enough so that clustering will be conducted inside particular subsets with the same labels [3].



V. DATA MINING ALGORITHM OF INTRUSION DETECTION The objection f data mining association rules was to find  out whole frequent temporal association rules from the large database. The aim of data mining association could be divided into the following stages: (1) form the whole frequent maximal temporal item set with their relative supports; (2) derive the whole frequent temporal association rules that suit for min-configure from frequent item sets mentioned above. See that in a very short time these frequent item sets were acquired, accepting the continual spiritual association rules was direct. Consequently, the algorithm for data mining continual modes was discussed on heather jangle. The main question of data mining temporal association rules was that the exhibition time of the items in the transaction database were permitted to be not same as one another [3].

(1) Description of algorithm Firstly, a pricings database D  was separated into n  separations depended on the exhibition time of items and PS, i.e. progressive screen, was blank. Define 1C as the set of ongoing applicant item sets formed by database D . Four parameters, i.e. p ; q , min_sup and min_leng, were considered as the input values into algorithm of . As stated above, the minimum support threshold needed was defined by min_sup. During the stage of temporal association rule forming, we use the parameter min_leng to be a purifying doorway for frequent item sets to fit for the minimal length needed for the exhibition time. The procession of algorithm was outlined as follows, where algorithm was divided into four sub-processions due to simple of description [3].

(2) The first sub-procedure of the new algorithm     Beginning time p  was constant, last time was defined by q ; original Sub-procession: The database D  was divided into m  separations and sp was defined as ? where 1+?= pqm [3].

VI. SIMULATION RESULTS The original studying data was about four gigabytes of  compressed binary TCP data from six weeks of network traffic. It was processed into about five million connection records. At the same time, the three weeks of detecting data was about three million joint records. The joint was a series of TCP packets beginning and ending at some good predefined times, between which data flows to and from a source IP (Internet Protocol) address to a target IP address under some predefined protocol. Every joint was signal as either normal, or as an attack with completely one particular attack kind. Every joint record concluded 100 bytes or so [4].

There were four kinds of attacks, which were listed as follows:  (1) DOS: denial of service; (2) R2L: remote to local; (3) U2R: client to root;     (4) PRB: surveillance and other probing, e.g.

The data sets concluded a whole of 36 studying attack  kinds, and another 15 kinds in the detecting data. The expected probabilities through the algorithm mentioned above. The results were showed in Figure 2.
