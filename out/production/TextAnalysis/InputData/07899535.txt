I.  INTRODUCTION   IoT technology is a technology or environment that transfers data through Internet in real time to attach sensor to object. Until now, devices connected to Internet needs some adjustment by humans to exchange data, But IoT enables to exchange data between humans and objects and among objects connected with Cloud and big data technology without the adjustment.

To transfer object?s data efficiently, LPWAN technology was suggested, which is a mobile radio communication network and a low power broadband convergence network for devices of IoT.

If near field communication technologies such as BLE and Zigbee for smart form and smart building are applied, person who offers IoT service needs to undergo complex procedure of smart home gateway and smartphone. But LPWAN solves this problem but to connect directly. This technology is useful in outdoor application area where a number of devices are required.

LPWAN technology has been through the standardization process as it becomes commercialized like other technologies in ICT area. The technology that already starts to serve is UNB(Ultra Narrow Band). The French company, Sigfox, has started the service and ETSI, the European standards institute has started to standardize it in the name of LTN(Low Throughput Networks). The LoRaWAN developed by  SemTech and IBM consume a little more power than UNB technology does, but has low interference of electric wave. The maximum speed is 100Kbps. The LoRa Alliance has been organized to pursue standardization. Also, like UNB, it uses unlicensed band of ISM band.

Accordingly, using IoT and LPWAN technology, we are going to design and realize bicycle location management system and shows its efficiency.



II. RELATED RESEARCH & REQUIRED SERVICES  A. Analazing LoRa?s performance  LoRa is IoT optimized communication technology, which is  one of LPWAN technologies. Unlike other communication technology, the LPWAN covers larger range of communication and uses, which is suitable for IoT and IoST where small amount of data is transferred.

To identify the overall features of LoRa communication, we conducted experiment in outdoor environment and moving environment.

To show the best performance depending on communication environment, LoRa supports 10 kinds of communication modes.

As we increased the distance between gateway and node by 500m, we checked PDR depending on mode 1, 5, and 10.

* : Corresponding Author        Figure 1. PDR depending on communication distance in  mode 1,5, and 10  Figure 1 shows changes of PDR depending on different  communication distance in mode 1, 5, and 10. In low mode, data transmission ratio is high but data rate is low. Since transmission ratios in mode 1 and mode 5 shows similar pattern, environment in certain area significantly affects communication. Seeing the graph of mode 10, lower the SF and longer the distance in nLoS environment, communication quality rapidly decreases.

Table 1. Values depending on distance and parameter in  mode 1    Sent packet, received information, received packet, time out,  success rate. Table 1 shows different values depending on each parameter and distance in mode 1.

SNR and Last Packet RSSI are highly related to successful transmission rate; Higher the SNR, higher the successful communication rate and also, higher the Last packet RSSI than sensitivity, higher the successful communication rate.

When transmission is successful, there is difference in absolute value of each SF between SNR and Last Packet RSSI.

For example, mode 1 is 117, Mode 5 to 114, Mode 10 to 111.

Figure 2. RSSI values depending on distance while moving  Table 2. Values depending on distance in mode 5 and  parameters    Figure 2 shows RSSI values depending on distance while  movie and Table 2 show values depending on distance in mode 5 and parameters.

As it moves to the point of 1.0km where communication is active to the one of 1.5km where communication is less active, the decrease of packet RSSI has been observed. The result of real packet shows that every case has filed when packet RSSI was lower than sensitivity.

B. Primary services  Bicycle tracking and managing system based on LoRa has  classified the services into basic service and additional one.

Basic service includes management service that enables to see the public location of bicycle in website and dynamic geofence service that gives users alarm signal when GPS attached to the bicycle is out of area that users have set in advance.

Additional services include weather check service, dragon radar SNS, GCM Notification and tracking service. More characteristics are as follows.

1. Weather Check Service Weather is important factor for users who uses a bicycle.

With weather API, weather information can be checked in App and details can be also checked by connected links.

2. Dragon Radar SNS Social Network Serice is the one of user friendly services.

Users with the same hobby and purpose can share their location and also send messages.

3. GCM Notification With GCM Notification, sers can receive an alarm signal,  for example, when their bicycle is out of certain area.

4. Tracking Service Through GPS data, users can check their route and exercise  information from sensor data.



III. SYSTEM DESIGN    Figure 3. Structure of system  The structure of system is composed of end device, gateway,  server, database and user web and application. For the end device Waspmote is used attached with internal acceleration sensor, GPS sensor and SX1272 of LoRa module. For the gateway, Meshlium is used, which is based on Linux OS, has SX1272 of LoRa Module, and offers Bluemix MQTT API.

For the server and database, the data provided by IBM Bluemix and database by Mongo DB are used. IBM Bluemix that serves a role of server, the Broker called IoTF receives data and transfer to Bluemix server. Then the data is saved to Mongo DB, in which data is provided in Cloud form in Bluemix. Another component of user web and application means website and application that users can see the stored data. The map in website and app uses Google Map Open API.

The website is created with Bootstrap and shown to users as reaction type. The app has functions to realize various services that are going to be served to individual users.

The process of data transmission is as follows. Firstly, end device attains values of sensor in devices. End device transfers sensing data to gateway using LoRa communication. The Meshlium saves data in the internal MySQL database and transfers to IoTF of IBM Blemix by MQTT protocol from Bluemix MQTT API.

If the Bluemix is in moving statement, data in IoTF is saved to MongoDB. Lastly, if users request data to server, server delivers the data saved in MongoDB to users. The communication protocol used in this time is HTTP(REST API).



IV. IMPLEMENTATION  A. Hardware   Figure 4. Hardware components and completely assembled  form    Table 3. Meshlium LoRa Radio Specification   Figure 4 shows node components used in end node and  assembled form to be installed in a bicycle and table 3 shows gateway device and description of the device.

The main components of end node are Waspmote -open source based single board micro-controller- SX1272 ?     communication module that supports LoRoWAN network in 868/900MHz bandwidth-, GPS to collect location data and battery to provide power to Waspmote.

B. Network configuration   1. Setting initial parameter  A. Channel: No. 9 (Center frequency: 922.52MHz)  B. Coding rate: 4/5  C. Bandwidth: 125KHz  D. Spreading factor: 12    Data rate varies by spreading factor and bandwidth. The system was designed to automatically set optimized data rate depending on current network state.

There was an API that controls Duty Cycle but it was hard to set Downlink of End node in real time, which was not useful.  To substitute this, we used the acceleration sensor of the End node, measured slope of node, decided that the node was moved if certain degree of slope was changed and realized the system as a duty cycle controlling method.

The assigned criteria of duty cycle were 15km/h, which is average speed of a bicycle. If a bicycle is moving with the speed of 15km/h, we wake the node every 100 to 100m and find GPS. If it is not moving, wake the node every 3 minutes assuming that the radius of Geofence is set as 500m to 1km.

Wireless transmission features limited communication in nLoS(non-Line of Sight) area, which becomes a problem when using communication while riding a bicycle an in rural area. To solve this problem, we contributed to raising successful transmission rate by using method that resends data maximum three times if ACK is not arrived within timeout.

VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK   IoT technology enables to monitor status of object in real time when Internet is not connected by providing connections between humans and objects and among obejcts. To support IoT technology efficiently, the LPWAN technology has been suggested and LoRaWAN technology of LPWAN was used to develop bicycle location tracking and managing system in this paper.

At first, we designed the overall construction of the system, identified necessary services, and designed and realized the system. The system was actually attached to the bicycle and its practicability was analyzed.

We are going to keep studying on various communication technology to offer services in a broaden area based on this research.
