Abstract-According to the reconstruction in the existing systems whose model is big and reconstruct speed is slow as the actual situation, this paper proposes a piece-division multiple output regression algorithm based on the Bayesian multiple adaptive regression splines (MARS) model to make the regression of very low resolution(VLR) face data. This paper studies the low resolution(LR) face image reconstruction, which has less data, using the regression method to reconstruction is the most appropriate way with small model, fast reconstruction speed and accurate results as its advantages. The experiments prove the reconstruction accuracy from error and identification accuracy two aspects in this paper.

I. INTRODUCTION  With the rising popularity of video monitoring system, bank, hotel, parking lot, and even residential areas have been installed monitoring system, which provides a lot of information for criminal investigation work and prevents crime to a certain extent. But in many cases, the target of interest is far from camera, so the face images is very small, shown in Fig.l. The LR face images become the main obstacle in face recognition. Therefore, in order to obtain the useful detail information about image, it is necessary to infer high-resolution(HR) images from the LR images, which is called the super-resolution Image Reconstruction technique(SR) [I].

Currently most of the research approaches in the field of SR reconstruction have a good performance on a 24x24 (or 24x32) to construct a HR face image (such as 96x96 pixels).

Some papers have shown that features of 24x24 facial images are still relatively complete [2], it has a high recognition rate after interpolation. More difficult problem is the reconstruction of lower than 24x24 face image, with little obvious face image features and very difficult to distinguish.

It is a big challenge to reconstruct.

(a) surveillance video  Fig. 1. the VLR face from the surveillance video   Fig.2 shows the examples of 12x12, 16x16, 24x24,36 x36 and 96x96 face image, it can be seen that the face of scale of 12x12 and 16x16 are difficult to distinguish, while the detail information of face in scale of 24x24 is rich, there is a recognition to a certain degree. We can found that the face image scale of 24x24 after resolution is not very high, but it can increase face recognition rate actually. And further reconstruction method can have a variety of options in the existing literature, which can greatly improve the performance on automatic face recognition in the monitoring and the public security system. This not only can be used in the automatic identification, but also can be used for artificial discrimination.

II. ALGORITHM  This paper applies Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines, MARS) for multi-output Regression [3], predicting the Regression model of LR face images and corresponding HR face images, the MARS is a new method for solving the problem of Multivariate data. MARS composes a flexible prediction model by summarizing and section interpretation equation. It is a regression handler which is flexible and can establish standard model automatically. Using this criterion model can predict the continuous and discontinuous dependent variable, Bayesian MARS can obtain the parameters of MARS by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (Markov Chain Monte Carlo, MCMC)[4], which has an accurate and stable predicting result.

In this paper, we propose a Bayesian MARS multi-output regression algorithm we will make regression prediction for the LR images and the corresponding HR face images by this.

This approach has the feature of model small, predict fast and an exact result. When we were training regression model, we use the piece-division method. The key process in this paper is that we use the piece-division method for each image of LR and the corresponding HR image. Piece-division diagrams are shown in Fig.3. Each piece will trains into a    2014 IEEE Workshop on Electronics, Computer and Applications  single model, thereby reducing the model and accelerating the reconstruction of speed, while the not training examples will have a more accurate ?on.

The learning process can be expressed as:  1) Divide LR image of KL scale into n2 equal slices, the size of each piece is(KLlnxKLln), a total of (KLln)2 pixels  2) Divide HR image of KH scale also into n2 equal slices, the size of each piece is (KH/nxKH/n), a total of (KH/n)2 pixels  3) The (KLln)2 pixels of LR image are used as input , the (KHln)2 pixels of HR are used as output, training based on the piece-division multiple output regression algorithm based on the Bayesian multiple. Each image will get n2 regression models  B. The testing process can be expressed as:  1) Divide the input image into n2 equal slices, each piece form the (KL/n)2 dimensional vector, input it into the  corresponding n2 model, get a (KHln)2 dimensional output, the total number is n2.

2) Compose the output into an image and then this is the reconstructed results.



III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS  In this experiment, we will reconstruct LR face images of 9x9, 12x12, 15x15 to 24x24 HR face images to verifY the proposed reconstruction algorithm in this paper, the number pieces of n2 is 9. We select 960 frontal face images randomly from FERET face database to detect the human faces and downsize them to the scale of 9x9, 12x12, 15x15, 24x24 face images. Divide each of these 960 images into 9 pieces.

Training 9 piece-division multi-output regression machines which based on the MARS model for training images. Then, it will predict an output of 64 dimensions for each of 960 face images with scale of 9x9, 12x12, 15x15 through regression, finally composing the output of 9 pieces of 64 dimensions into a HR face image of 24x24. In order to quantifY the improved performance in this algorithm, we will through error, reconstruction images and recognition rate to verifY the effect of reconstruction algorithm in this paper.

A. Reconstruction error  After reconstruction, we represent the error as follows :  f f (Pil - o'.j) F,rror = -"i='-'-I--"Ic:.-=I'-----_-::-:-: __ n X m X 256 (1)   Where n is the total number of face images, m is the total number of pixels of HR images, Pi,! is the jth pixel in the ith reconstructed HR face image (between 0 and 255), 0u is the jth pixel in the ith original HR face image (between 0 and 255) Error is the predicted average error for each pixel.

Sample coefficient and training images rate have an effect on the reconstruction error. The following will talk about the relationship between them and start with the experimental results as the basis to explain the process of selecting sample coefficient and training images rate.

1) Sample coefficient  Sample coefficient has three parameters in this algorithm? k _max, mcmc _samples, burn_in. k _max represent maximum of spline basic functions, namely the number of samples k in the formula (I). mcmc_samples is the samples number of simulating Markov Chain in the process of Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) [5][6]. Burn_in refers to the number of iterations, the sampler will update the current status of the chain at each iteration, the higher burn jn , the higher accuracy of the regression model, the lower reconstruction error, but the reconstruction time will be increased.

Due to the pieces number of multi-output regression machine is 9 in the training process, therefore, the final predicted output will be nine 64-dimension, it is reasonable that the number of spline k_ max takes 50.

FigA shows the relationship between burn in, mcmc_samples of sample coefficient and reconstruction error.

When burn_in changes from 100 to 300, the magnitude of reducing the reconstruction error is relatively large, while burn jn changes from 300 to 1000 in the process, the magnitude of changing the reconstruction error is relatively small, the change is stable, therefore, burn_in is set to be 300.

According to changes in the five curves, we can see that with increasing mcmc_samples, the magnitude of changing the reconstruction error is relatively small, so mcmc _samples has little effect on the reconstruction error, at the same time, the greater mcmc_samples, the longer cost of reconstruction time and the efficient of reconstruction will drops, so we select the middle one of the five parameters as the size of mcmc samples, mcmc samples is set to be 200.

2) Rate of training image  Set the scale of 9x9, 12x12, 15xl5 of 960 LR face images with a certain percentage respectively as the training images,    2014 IEEE Workshop on Electronics, Computer and Applications  the rest as the prediction images. The effect of reconstruction will change accordingly to the different proportions.

Rate of tlllilling image  FigS.The rate of training images and reconstruction error  The relationship between the rate of training images and reconstruction error is showed in Fig.5. We can see that with the increase of the rate, the reconstruction error decreases.

When the training image rate is set to be 10%, the reconstruction error is bigger than other rates, it is 7.03%.

While the proportion of training images is 20%, the reconstruction error becomes 5.95%, at last the reconstruction error becomes 5%. The rate of training images is set to be 80% or 90%, the error is almost the same, therefore, the rate of training paper is set to be 80%. Then, 80% of the images train the multi-output regression model based on our algorithm, and all the LR images make a prediction based on the trained regression model, finally get the corresponding HR images.

To evaluate the reconstruction performance of our algorithm, we compare it with the existing method, namely "S2R2", which was proposed in reference r21.

Fig6. the comparison for "S2R2" and our method  For the scale of 12x 12 as LR face images to reconstruct the HR images of 24x24, the error of "S2R2" is 6.04% by Hennings-Yeomans in reference [2]. Comparing with this approach, the error of our algorithm are respectively 5.26%, 4.96%, 4. 56% for the scale of 9x9,12xI2,15xI5 LR face images to reconstruct the HR images of 24x24. Comparison figure for "S2R2" and our method is shown in Fig.6. We can see that the reconstruction effect of our method has a better performance than "S2R2".

B. SR results To further understand the reconstruction effect of our  approach, we will perform experiments on recognition rate and show our SR results.

Fig7. SR results  This article is made to reconstruct scale of 9x9, 12x 12, 15x15 LR face image scale to the scale of 24x24 HR images.

The reconstruction results are shown in Fig.7. The first row of (a) and (b) are LR images of 9x9, 12x12, 15x15, the second line of images are the HR images of 24x24. The last ones are the reconstructed images after prediction. From this figure, we can see that our algorithm has achieved the reconstruction effect, the result images not only have more pixels than the original ones, but also more clearly and improve recognizable.

C. Recognition rate In the experiment, we use 960 HR face images of 24x24  in FERET database to establish face database.

Reconstruction method has a higher recognition rate than the interpolation, For LR face images of 9x9, 12x12, 15x15, recognition rates of HR images by interpolation are 20.10%, 26.98%, 30.09%, while recognition rates of HR images by our algorithm are 57.10%, 59.23%, and 61.08%.

Therefore, we can conclude that our method can greatly improve the accuracy of the reconstruction from the recognition rate.
