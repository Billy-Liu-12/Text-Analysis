Effects of Thermal Accelerated Ageing on a  Medium Voltage Oil-Immersed Current

Abstract? Asset management and preventive  maintenance tendencies in the electrical power industry lead towards increasing exigencies of operational equipment condition assessment. There is a big interest in confirming loading limitations of different components of the electrical system whether related to generation, transmission or distribution of electric energy. One of these components is the oil-immersed current transformer, which plays a very important role in the optimal operation of substations. Power and distribution transformers have largely been investigated thereby leaving an opportunity for research in instrument transformers. Efforts are currently underway to obtain guidelines for estimation of ?loss of life? of a current transformer as a result of short term overloading. Such guidelines will have a direct impact on maximizing an important asset in the form of a current transformer.

This paper provides a detailed description of the technical approach taken at the Tennessee Technological University in order to implement and carry out Thermal Accelerated Ageing procedures on Medium Voltage Oil-Immersed Current Transformers and the corresponding validation tests performed.

The use of typical & non-typical load profiles, state-of-the-art DC & AC testing practices, same as on-line gas monitoring and temperature data acquisition is being described. Results will be presented in the context of ageing of the medium voltage current transformer.

Key words ? Stress, accelerated ageing, insulation degradation, loss of life, load profile

I. INTRODUCTION ORLDWIDE the electrical industry, whether it is related to generation, transmission or distribution of  electric energy, is committed to obtaining accurate condition assessment of their valuable operational equipment. Several authors have addressed the issue of evaluating power and distribution transformers? condition based on different experimental techniques.  Insulation deterioration creates a progressive risk of failure.

Since August 2006, the Center for Energy Systems at Tennessee Technological University (TTU) has initiated a new  Diego Robalino Vanegas is a Graduate Student of Electrical Engineering at Tennessee Technological University.

SMahajan@tntech.edu   research project to determine the ageing properties and ageing acceleration factors of instruments transformers, specifically of medium voltage oil-immersed current transformers of the measurement type. Ageing of Instrument Transformers starts being investigated by researchers in Europe and America [1][2][3].

The End of Life Criteria for power and distribution transformers is still under discussion. IEEE standard C57.91 [4] provides the best reference for the computation of these criteria. Based on these references, authors present in the following text a detailed description of a Thermal Accelerated Ageing System implemented to overload sample units. The data provided in this document is taken from a 69kV oil- immersed CT loaded under laboratory conditions. The information obtained from the experimental practice is unique.

The state-of-the-art techniques applied here were used before only for power and distribution transformers.

Life testing results obtained in the laboratory are validated against the Degree of Polymerization (DP) and Furanic Compounds in Oil analysis carried out by a third party certified and highly recognized laboratory.



II. THERMAL ACCELERATED AGEING  A. Accelerated Life Testing Every component of the electrical system is being stressed by different factors. The mechanisms for Accelerated Life Testing are mainly accomplished by applying different loading factors at specifically pre-determined periods, which is similar to reducing the service time scale.  As indicated by [5], no matter how efficient the manufacturing process is, one or more failures may occur due to:  ? Careless planning, substandard equipment and raw material used, lack of proper quality control, etc;  ? Random or chance causes; ? Wear-out or fatigue, caused by the ageing of the item.

The Acceleration Factor (AF) is defined in its simple form as:  ALT  ON F t  t A ..?  (1) Where: tN.O. ? Life under Normal Operation (Based on Typical Load Profiles)  W       tALT ? Life under Accelerated Life Testing (Based on Non- typical Load Profiles).

For a safe and standardized procedure, reference [4] has been used to formulate the Ageing Acceleration Factor (FAA) and other Ageing Equations. Medium-Voltage Oil Immersed Current Transformers life has been considered to depend on qualitative (Ratio, Voltage, Class) and quantitative variables (Load, Temperature). These variables will generate a linear model to describe the ageing process of the units. Acceleration Factor Models are well described in [6] and other literature related to Design of Experiments. For this specific application, the Arrhenius model presented in [4] was used. It is important to emphasize that transformer?s (of any type) life is directly understood as the life of the insulation of the unit. In this work, the word ?life? means insulation life. The equation for ageing acceleration factor of power transformers rated for an average winding temperature rise of 65?C is given by [4]:   ? ?  ?     ? ?  ?  ? 273383exp H BB  AAF              (2)  Where:  H ? Hot Spot Temperature (?C) B ? Ageing rate constant = 15000.

FAA in (2) equals unity under normal operating conditions of power and distribution transformers with H equal to 110?C. Temperatures greater than 110?C accelerate the ageing process, but if the operation maintains H below this value, it is assumed that the life of the unit is extended. Nevertheless, these values are applicable only for power and distribution transformers rated for 65?C over a 30?C average ambient temperature and 15?C allowance between the hottest-spot and average winding temperatures. The sample units were rated for 55?C rise over a 30?C average ambient per IEEE C57.13- 1993. Therefore, H for the instrument transformers tested in the laboratory will follow the loading guidelines defined in Annex D of [4] and equals 95?C. The equation for FAA of these units is:    ? ?  ?     ? ?  ?  ? 273   exp HAAF                                                     (3)  Having defined the ageing acceleration factor, it is  important to estimate the % Loss of Life (LOL) resulting from the equivalent acceleration factor (FEQA) and the duration of the stress. This expression is given by [4] as:    lifeinsulationNormal  tF LOL EQA  __  % ??  ?                                (4)   Where: t ? duration of stress (hours) Normal insulation life ? In this work takes the  estimated value for DP=200.

1) Experimental Set-up  Details of the experimental set-up were presented in [7].

Due to the new loading conditions, the set-up was upgraded and its connection diagram is shown in Fig.  1    Fig.  1. Thermal Loading Set-up - Connection Diagram    B. Typical & Non-typical Load Profiles  Typical load profiles provide an average load of 80% of the  loading rate as illustrated in [4] p-96. Non-typical profiles used for thermal accelerated life testing will maintain an average load greater than 100%.

The technical approach considered in this work involves the application of constant non-typical load profiles to thermally stress the CT. One of the Current Transformers - CT2 (1200/600:5, 69kV) was loaded @ 300% rated load (Ip = 3600 A) for 169 hours.

The simulated load was the controllable variable to stress the sample unit. Each of the profiles used for experimentation provided valuable data by means of uncontrolled observed variables (Hot-spot temperature). These values were obtained from the strategically embedded temperature sensors OP1 & OP2, installed in the CT during the manufacturing process [7].Temperature curves presented in [7] did not include the non-typical 300% load profile, which is presented in Fig.  2.

The observed temperature fluctuation is mainly due to ambient temperature variation in the laboratory.



III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS   To visualize the effect of each loading cycle on the condition of the CT, the following tests were carried out: Complete CT Functional, DC Insulation Tests, Furanic Compound Analysis (ASTM D 5837), Solid Insulation Degree of Polymerization, On-line Hot-Spot Temperature monitoring and On-Line Dissolved Gas Analysis.

Each test provided information on one specific parameter; as described below.

A. Insulation Testing with DC A summary of all data obtained from DC tests carried out  with the MEGGER S1-1052 tester is presented in TABLE I.

The simplest Insulation Test, Insulation Resistance (IR) or Spot Test indicates a clear variation of the IR value after loading the unit at 300% rated load. The Insulation Resistance became approximately 20% of the initial value. The Polarization Index (PI) value was computed as IR10min/IR1min, in a similar way, the Dielectric Absorption Ratio (DAR) was obtained as the ratio IR60sec/IR30sec.

B. Dissolved Gas Analysis The loading process was recorded using the SERVERON  TM-8 Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) on-line monitor, its closed loop repeatable oil collection process is used in Oil- Immersed Instrument Transformers for the first time. The readings obtained from this device are presented in Fig.  3.

CT2 Gas composition during the 300% Loading Process  At 300% load, there is a clear increase of CO and CO2. The increase in CO & CO2 is typical for insulation that has aged in service. Moreover, other gases came into picture in small  amounts: Methane, Ethylene and Ethane. These are so-called ?hot-metal? gases (produced in surrounding oil).

Hydrogen was never observed alone during the loading process. Therefore, only temperature dependent Key Ratios (KR) are worth calculations.

C. Furan Compound & DP  The Furan compound analysis is an industry standard test which allows a comparative value of the various tests carried out in the laboratory. Oil and insulation paper samples were taken and analyzed in a third party laboratory. The results are shown in TABLE II.

- FAL accumulation greater than 20 ?g/L/year is indicative of accelerated ageing for a sealed power transformer with thermally upgraded insulation.

D. CT Analysis of Functional Parameters The OMICRON CT Analyzer was used to run a complete  functional test of the unit. The readings obtained are shown in TABLE III.

IV. CONCLUSION   An effective technical approach to thermally accelerate the ageing process of an Oil-Immersed CT based on non-typical loading profiles and without the presence of AC voltage has been successfully applied.

Several state-of-the-art technologies for monitoring, testing and assessment of electrical equipment conditions were used for the first time in Oil-Immersed Current Transformers. The data obtained is unique for CTs of this type.

The On-line Dissolved Gas Analysis clearly identified the effect of heat on the chemical composition of the oil. The increase of CO and CO2 is an indication of thermal degradation of the cellulose material. Key ratios 3 & 4 were calculated and the values are indicative of thermal fault and cellulosic degradation.

The DC Insulation Test indicates a variation of the insulation resistance to approximately 20%. Nevertheless, the readings indicate an acceptable value of insulation resistance to continue with the unit in operation.

Degree of Polymerization is definitely the most accurate source to predict the remaining life of the unit. Although, ageing of the cellulosic insulation within a current transformer may not be uniform, and the DP test confirms this statement.

The location where the paper sample was taken is very important.

From the furan compound analysis, the concentration of 2- furaldehyde (FAL) is indicative of thermal stress and cellulosic degradation. Based on the same oil analysis, the  estimated Remaining Life decreased by approximately 10%.

This value is approximately three times greater than that obtained in (9). This discrepancy in the results calls for a possible revision of the FAA calculation, which implies further research of the value of the reference ?H. The obtained results indicate that this vale might be less than 95?C.
