I.          INTRODUCTION  Evaluation of examination paper is an important part of examination. Base on the students? results, and some special rules, value the examination questions. Now, most teachers value it subjectively only by the students who?s answer is good or not. This way can get some one-sided results, and can?t quantity the values, so the result may lose some important information; and the appraisal can?t guide teacher in their work accurately. The paper proposes a new way, applies association rules mining to the evaluation of examination paper and find out some useful information.

Association rules mining is an important area of research for data mining. A number of potential and interesting relationships will be found in the large amount of data through mining some potential relationship between the itemsets of the database. These relationships play an important role in guiding and reference for the market basket analysis, cross-selling of commodities, business decision-making such as advertising mail analysis.



II. THE ASSOCIATION RULES  Data mining is the analysis of (often large) observational data sets to find unsuspected relationships and to summarize the data in novel ways that are both understandable and useful to the data owner. Association rules are among the most popular representations for local patterns in data mining. An association rule is a simple probabilistic statement about the co-occurrence of certain events in a database, and is particularly applicable to sparse transaction data sets, which is useful for  discovering interesting relationships hidden in large data set. For example, huge amounts of customer purchase data are collected daily at the checkout counters of grocery stores. TABLE I. illustrates an example of such data. Each row in this table corresponds to a transaction, which contains a unique identifier labeled TID and a set of items bought by a giver customer. Retailers are interested in analyzing the data to learn about the purchasing behavior of their customers. Such valuable information can be used to support a variety of business-related application such as marketing promotions, inventory management, and customer relationship management.

[1-3]  TABLE I.  AN EXAMPLE OF MARKET BASKET TRANSACTIONS  TID Items  1 {Bread,Milk}  2 {Bread,Diapers,Beer,Eggs}  3 {Milk,Diapers,Beer,Cola}  4 {Bread,Milk,Diapers,Beer}  5 {Bread,Milk,Diapers,Cola}  The following rule can be extracted from the data set shown in Table 1: {Diapers} {Beer},the rule suggests that a strong relationship exists between the sale of diapers and beer because many customers who buy diapers also buy beer. Retailers can use this type of rules to help them identify new opportunities for cross-selling their products to the customers. An association rule is an implication expression of the form XY, where X and Y are disjoint  itemsets (set of 0 or more items), that is X?Y= ? . The strength of an association rule can be measured in terms of its support and confidence. Support determines how often a rule is applicable to a given data set, while confidence determines how frequently items in Y appear in transactions that contain X.

Support is an important measure because a rule that has very low support may occur simply by chance. A low support rule is also likely to be uninteresting from a business perspective because it may not be profitable to promote items that customers seldom buy together.

Confidence, on the other and, measures the reliability of the inference made by a rule.For a given rule X Y, the higher the confidence, the more ikely it is for Y to be   DOI 10.1109/CICC-ITOE.2010.32     present in transactions that contain X.Confidence also provides an estimate of the conditional robability of Y given X. The association rule mining problem can be formally tated as: Given a set of transactions T, find all the rules aving support>=minsup and confidence>=minconf, where insup and minconf are the corresponding support and onfidence thresholds. Therefore, a common strategy adopted by many ssociation rule mining algorithms is to decompose the roblem into two major subtasks (1) Frequent itemset eneration, whose objective is to find all the itemsets that atisfy the minsup threshold. These itemsets are called requent itemsets. (2) Rule generation, whose objective is to xtract all the high-confidence rules from the frequent itemsets ound in the previous step.

These rules are called strong rules.

[4-6]   Association rules mining can found an interesting relationship between the properties and projects in the database that the relations are unknown in advance or be hidden. Association rules mining usually treated transaction as objects. That is a relationship of object in the database, existing research are mainly oriented to transaction database. Description of the problem are as  follows: set I={ i1 ?i2????im } as a collection of different for m items, D is a collection of transaction. Each  of them such as T ? I is a group of itemset which has a unique identifier for TID. X is collection for some items, if  X ?T?said T include X. Association rule is expressed as X Y? ?Which X ? I,Y ? I?And X ? Y = ? .

X is the reason of the rules. Y is the result of the rules. ?1?Rules for X Y? ?s support is defined as: the percentage of support( X Y? )=D contains ( X Y? ). ?2?Rules of confidence is defined as?  ( ) ( )  ( )  SUPPORT X Y Confidence X Y  SUPPORT X  ? ? =   Association rule mining is just to find out such rules  that their support and confidence were greater than user- specified minimum support and minimum confidence.

1) sup( ) min_ supX Y >? ;  2) s u p ( )  m in _ s u p ( )  X Y c o n f  X >  ? ;   There are many algorithms of association rules, of which the classic algorithm for Apriori is the most influential algorithm for mining the Boolean association rules of frequent itemsets which generate frequent itemsets through the method of having candidate itemsets, and its core idea is: all the subsets of any frequent itemsets must be frequent itemset.

The algorithm is spent on I / 0 for a lot of time because of the need to repeatedly scan the database and produce a large number of frequent itemsets, therefore, it will resulting very low efficiency for data mining. Therefore, in order to improve the efficiency of Apriori algorithm, Apriori algorithm have been improved on a large number of extent, would like to find an efficient and reliable algorithm for mining frequent itemsets, but most of them are just confined to the optimize and improvement of the serially algorithm. Optimization of the serial algorithm, to a certain extent, improve efficiency, but it is on a single  computer run, in theory, N computers running Apriori algorithm, then the efficiency will be improved, therefore, the algorithm of the association rules mining is trying to parallel.

The association rules is to discover interesting high frequently pattern, relating and relativity from transaction database, the relational database and mass data itemsets of other information storage. It is mainly implemented by two steps: Firstly, find out the frequent itemsets of all, secondly, produce the strong association rules by frequent itemsets. The overall performance of mining the association rules is decided by the first step, namely find out the frequent itemsets of all. Apriori algorithm is a basic one of finding out the frequent itemsets.



III. APPLICATION IN EVALUATION OF EXAM PAPER  At present, most schools? Evaluation of examination paper only based on find out how many students have answered the question rightly, and how many students haven?t. This way can get some one-sided results, and can?t quantity the values, so the result may lose some important information; and the appraisal can?t guide teacher in their work accurately. The paper proposes a new way, applies association rules mining to evaluation of examination paper and find out some useful information as follows:  TABLE II.  LIST OF QUESTION?S ATTRIBUTION  ID type Difficult  level attribution answer  Single-choice questions  easy Assembler right  Multiple- choice questions  easy VC++ wrong  21101 SR Answer difficult Assembler right  ?? ?? ?? ?? ??  First, we should transact database. A transaction database is a set of records representing transactions, each with a time stamp, an identifier and a set of items.

Associated with the transaction files could also be descriptive data for the items. For example, in the case of the evaluation of examination paper of Basic Computer Culture, the table such as shown in TABLE II.Each record is a question identifier, attribution of question, types, the level of difficult and so on. Since relational databases do not allow nested tables, transactions are usually stored in flat files or stored in two normalized transaction tables, one for the transactions and one for the transaction items.

The table such as shown in TABLE III.

The next step is to transform categorical attribute into asymmetric binary variables. There are some potential issues such as attribute has many possible values or distribution of attribute values is highly skewed, so we should aggregate the low-support attribute values or drop the highly frequent items. Then each row of table corresponds to a transaction and each column corresponds to an item. An item can be treated as a binary variable     whose value is one if the item is present in a transaction an zero otherwise.

TABLE III.   LIST TRANSACTION TABLE  Item value Code  Single-choice questions 100  Multiple-choice questions 200  Chenkongdi 300  Judgement 400     Type  Qustions-Answers 500  Easy 600  Medium difficulty 601  Difficulty 602  Difficult level  Very difficulty 603  Basic of Computer 604  Office 605  OS 606  Attribution  Internet 607  Right 608 Answer  Wrong 609  Finally, generate candidate and rule. There are two operations in candidate generation, candidate generation and candidate pruning. The first operation generates new candidate k-itemsets based on the frequent (k-1)-itemsets found in the previous iteration. The second eliminates some of the candidate k-itemsets using the support-based pruing strategy. Then we can extract association rules efficiently from a given frequent itemset. Each frequent k- itemset, Y, can produce up to 2  k -2 association rules,  ignoring rules that have empty antecedents or consequents (??Y or Y??). An association rule can be extracted by partitioning the itemset Y into two non-empty subsets, X and Y?X, such that X?Y?X satisfies the confidence threshold.

[7]   There are 820 transactions and 15 items in the data set.

The algorithm is then applied to the data set with minsup=7% and minconf=50%. Some of the rules extracted by the algorithm are shown in TABLE IV.

TABLE IV.  ASSOCIATION RULES EXTRACTED  Association Rule Support Confidence  {600}?{100} 23.1% 76.9%  {607}?{608} 8.7% 54.2%  {100,600,605}?{608} 21.2% 87.7%  {500,600,605}?{608} 10.3% 69.8%  {400,602,607}?{608} 12.1% 76.4%  The first item of the above rules may be explained as: 25.2% of the paper are easy titles and multi-choice, among  which there are74.8% easy Questions. Item 2 may be understood as: The key points of the examination paper are network infrastructure in which students got 20.4% of the final score, and 76.4% were answered correctly; Item 3 could be interpreted as: the knowledge points is Office that is easy, and multiple-choice takes 20.2% of the examination paper, and 86.3% of the easy multiple-choice were answered correctly.

According to item3and4, we can draw this conclusion: There are a large difference in scores between Single- choice questions and the Qustions-Answers, based on the same difficulty points--Office. This tells us: the students have not mastered Office well and need the further practice. In accordance with item 2 and 5, we can see that: The students have scored little in the network infrastructure, but in the Judge Questions, the students? scores are relatively high. If only assess students' knowledge of the network from Judge Questions, we will draw a one-sided conclusion.



IV. CONCLUSIONS  Association rules is the one most important theory in data mining, which have a wide range of applications in the various fields, but, applied to the Evaluation of reliable, it can be said that has just begun, with the mining association rules theoretical the constant further research and using, the rational, efficient and objective analysis of the examination, all from the Association Rules theoretical support. And, Judging from the current access to a large number of information, Association rules, applied to the analysis of the test research, has aroused the experts wide attention. This can also be used to the others for the college teaching management .of course, from which, to find hidden useful information for the college teaching management services.
