WP9- 16:10 Sm FuSs, 1bha*_Jlm Utilization of Qualitative Information

Abstract - - Qualitative reasoning is especially appealing for multisensor target tracking because of its ability to accomodate uncertainty and conflict.

T1his paper presents a rule-based modeling approach for manuever target tracking, and- a qualitative track/data association technique by combining numerical data with often informational but seldom used surveillance operator's intuition. Computer simulations validate the contribution of such information particularly in a stressful target tracking environment.



I. Introduction  Classical estimation theory uses prior modeling knowledge which is deterministic, statistical or both.

In such a framework, it is very difficult to utilize non-numerical qualitative information. This paper explores the use of such information in estimation, especially in target tracking, where previously ignored surveillance operators' expertise may impact system performance. First, we examine some problems that arise in multiple target tracking.

Most tracking filters are model-based and thus, if a target trajectory deviates from the assumed model, then the tracker performance starts to degrade.

This is a well-known problem and numerous techniques to deal with it have been published in literature.

The most popular techniques are: (i) adjustable noise variances [1-5], (ii) augmenting states [6-111, (iii) input estimation [12-15], and (iv) multiple model [16- 18] and interactive multiple model [19-21]. Tracking in clutter causes another uncertainty due to the uncertain origin of measurements. There are many techniques ranging from the simple nearest, neighbor association to the more complex multiple hypotheses [22,23]. However, even with these sophisticated algorithms, tracking of maneuvering targets remains elusively challenging.

In section 2, we revisit the a-P tracking algo- rithm and analyze its characteristics to explore the possible utilization of a rule-based logic for maneu- vering target tracking. Section 3 reviews the most widely used track and data association algorithms in current tracking systems, and presents a formulation of qualitative knowledge-augmented track/data associa- tion algorithms. Computer simulation results are presented in section 4.

2. Maneuver Target Tracking  Qualitative reasoning has been known to be useful when rigorous mathematical modeling is too difficult or computationally too expensive: balancing double pendulum, truck backup, etc. Another example is the tracking of maneuvering targets, since such target dynamics cannot be exactly described. Fuzzy logic, as introduced by Zadeh [24] has been suggested as being appropriate for describing systems that are too com- plex or too ill-defined to apply precise mathematical analysis. Thus, it is quite logical to consider a fuzzy logic based tracker to process maneuvering targets. Since Mamdani's seminal work [25] on a control application of fuzzy set theory, fuzzy control has drawn tremendous interest throughout industry and academia, and has reached fruition in numerous practical applications [26-31]. In this section, we reexamine the a-f tracking algorithm and attempt to deduce fuzzy control rules.

2.1. a-fl Tracker  The a-,6 algorithms are the most extensively applied fixed-coefficient filters. These filters are defined by the following equations and are used when only position measurement is available:  x(klk) x(klk-l)+.a[xm(k) -x(klk-l)] (2-1) x(kik) x(klk.-l)+(f/T)[xm(k)--x(klk-1)])(2-2) y(klk) y(klk-l)+a[ym(k)_-y(klk-l)] (2-3) y(klk) - (kjk-l)+(fl/T)[ym(k) -y(kjk-1)](2-4)  Note that the smoothing is performed in each coordinate separately. The predicted target position is simply a linear extrapolation from the previous smoothed position with a constant velocity.

The range of smoothing gains a and f, can be obtained from the characteristic equation of the filter, z2 + (r+fP-2) + (1-ca) - 0. Applying the Jury's test yields the stability region which provides admis- sible a, P values:  p > 0 2a + ,9 < 4 0 <a <2.

Most of the a-# tracking algorithms use two sets of smoothing equations: region coordinate smoothing (RCS) and track coordinate smoothing (TCS). The RCS is employed for non-maneuvering targets, with the equations given by (2-1) through (2-4), while the TCS is used for maneuvering targets. In TCS, the filter residuals are decomposed into the radial and the crossing direction with separate smoothing gains, so that the residual in the crossing direction may produce significantly greater response in the perpendicular direction, which is characteristic of turning aircraft. Separate sets of smoothing parameters are usually provided for different valida- tion gates in both RCS and TCS. In addition, the velocity smoothing parameter p is a function of target speed. Smoothing is also controlled by the correlation gates and the track mode (normal, transition or maneuver). The normal mode is assigned to tracks which have correlated with data in the small valida- tion gate. This mode implies good quality straight line tracking. Transition between the modes depends on the correlation, current target mode, and maneuver detection test.

2.2 Rule Based Manuever Logic  Recognizing that maneuver dynamics cannot be rigorously described, we attempt to design a fuzzy tracker which may provide a faster and more precise maneuver response. Observable parameters are the filter residual and change of the residual, and the control parameters are the gain constants, a and fi.

For feasibility evaluation, a simple benign target environment is used, i.e. no false alarms, probability of detection PD<1.0 and a single target.

A fuzzy algorithm consists of defining membership functions, formation of control rules, and making decisions. It is imperative to formulate an extensive rule set based on experts' experience and to derive     input-output relationships from the rules. The control rules are generally expressed in if-then statements. In addition, it is necessary to quantize the qualitative statements expressed in terms of linguistic variables. These variables are:  LP - large positive, MP - medium positive, SP - small positive, ZE - zero.

SM - small negative, MN- medium negative, LN - large negative,  After formulating control rules, the next step is to define the membership functions of linguistic sets.

The shape of membership functions is quite arbitrary and heavily depends on system requirements.

Membership Functions:  The membership functions chosen for the fuzzy tracker are taken to be the polygonal curves converting the values below:  Dc 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 -+-  ZE 1.0 0.8 0.2 0 0 0 0 0 0 SP 0.2 0.8 1.0 0.8 0.2 0 0 0 0 MP 0 0 0.2 0.8 1.0 0.8 0.2 0 0 LP 0 0 0 0 0.2 0.8 1.0 1.0 1.0  Fuzzy Decision:  Suppose the tracker produces a filter deviation of 5 (nmi) and change of deviation of 30 (knots). It can be shown that rules 1, 3 and 5 are applicable.

The points of intersection of value 5 (nmi) and the deviation curves have membership grades,  PD - (0.9, 0, 0.5, 0, 0.5, 0.6, 0, 0).

Similarly, the second curves show that deviation change of 30 knots has the membership function,  PAD - (0.9, 0, 0.9, 0, 0.1, 0, 0, 0).

Membership function of the control is obtained from the intersection of two input sets,  AD-AD - (0.9, 0, 0.5, 0, 0.1, 0, 0, 0)  whose elements represent the proportions of the contribution by each rule.

Thus, the weighted average of smoothing gains are computed as:  a- 0,09 + 0.405 + 0.4-0- 0.16  AD 0 20  ZE 1.0 0.8 SP 0.2 0.8 MP 0 0 LP 0 0  40 60 80  0.2 0 0 1.0 0.8 0.2 0.2 0.8 1.0 0 0 0.2  100 120 140 160  0- 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.8 0.2 0 0 0.8 1.0 1.0 1.0  a 0 .1 .2 .3 .4 .5 .6 .7 .8 --+-  ZE 1.0 0.8 0.4 0.1 0 0 0 0 0 SP 0.4 0.8 1.0 0.8 0.4 0.1 0 0 0 MP 0 0.1 0.4 0.8 1.0 0.8 0.4 0.1 0 LP 0 0 0 0.1 0.4 0.8 1.0 0.8 0.4  0 .1 .2 .3 .4 .5 .6 .7 .8 -+-  ZE 1.0 0.8 0.2 0 0 0 0 0 0 SP 0.8 0.1 0.8 0.2 0 0 0 0 0 MP 0.2 0.8 1.0 0.8 0.2 0 0 0 0 LP 0 0.2 0.8 1.0 0.8 0.2 0 0 0  where Dc is a current deviation between the current measurement and the current predicted position,  Dc - V[xm(k) - xp(k)f2 + [ym(k) - yp(k)]2 xp(k) - x(klk-1), xp(k) - x(kjk-l)  and AD - ABS(Dc(k) - Dc(k-l)), change of deviations.

Control Rules:  Control rules for the feasibility evaluation of a fuzzy tracker are a simplified correlation algorithm that have been implemented in a currently deployed system:  (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8)  If Dc - SP and AD - SP or ZE then a,l - ZE.

If one no correlation, then a,p -SP If Dc - HP and AD - SP, then n-HP, f-SP If two consecutive no correlations, then c,p - MP If Dc - MP and AD - ME, then a,p - MP If Dc - MP and AD - LP, then a - MP, fi LP If Dc - LP and AD - LP, then nfl - LP If no 3 correlations in a row, then c,n - LP.

3.1 Track and Data Association  Correlation of radar data and tracks (called data association) is prerequisite to any filtering process.

Data association (DA) is accomplished according to a priority scheme based on the type of sensor data: IFF or search, and the validation gates about the predicted target position where the data may fall.

There are typically two or more validation gates which are of circular or elliptic shape.

The simplest DA technique is the Nearest Neighbor method that selects the measurement nearest to a predicted target position. However, this method can lead to very poor performance in an environment where spurious measurements -occur frequently. Another widely used approach is to compute a simple arithmetic average of measurements that fall in the validation region. Although the averaging DA is very simple, it provides reasonably good performance and thus has been implemented in many air defense systems. The most complex and optimal method is the multiple hypothesis tracking (HiT) [15,23] . It considers all the possibilities of not only track maintenance but also track initiation and deletion. Major drawback of the MHT is the exponentially growing computational complexity based on the increasing number of returns.

A compromise between the two extremes is the probabilistic data association (PDA) [15,23]. This is a multiple hypothesis data association but the association decision is made after each scan. FDA is designed for association of a single target in clutter. The number of false alarms is usually modelled by a Poisson density and false alarms are assumed to be distributed uniformly in space.

When there are multiple targets in a surveillance area, the PDA does not perform well because the false alarm model is no longer valid. It is mainly due to the persistent returns generated by interfering targets. Thus, joint association probabilities should be considered to resolve this mis-association problem.

Like the PDA, the joint probabilistic data association (JPDA) [15,21,23] assumes that tracks have been established and the number of targets are known. In this technique, a hypothesis table is formed by enumerating all the possible track/return pairings and computing the corresponding hypothesis probabilities.

Suppose there are n targets and m false alarms in the surveillance area. The probability of Ho (no returns originated from targets) is  P(HO) X (l-PD)n.X (3-1)  since no target detection is made and m false alarms are detected. The probability of any other hypotheses 14 is of the form  P(H+) PDk(l - PD)n-kAm-k II gij (3-2) where the likelihood of measurement j being originated from track i is assumed to be a Gaussian, denoted by gij of distance vij - yj - HXi, PD denotes the probability of correct target detection, X is the false alarms- density, and k is number of detected targets. The association probabilities are computed by summing up hypothesis probabilities for g'iven target and measurement assignments from the hypothesis table. Several JPDA implementations have been proposed to reduce computational complexity by approximating the association probabilities. However, all of these JPDA-like algorithms suffer severely as number of sensor measurements increases.

Recognizing the shortcomings of JPDA, we have developed an intuitive approach using surveillance operator's subjective knowledge. When only position information is measured by sensors, it is not surprising to note that the x2-vTS-lv variable includes effects of distance residual and sensor accuracy, not target direction explicitly. This can be easily verified from an error ellipse drawn along the target trajectory. Observe that the major axis of the error ellipse does not generally coincide with the target direction. But, this is quite counter- intuitive since it seems reasonable to give more weight to the measurements that fall around the longitudinal target direction, reflecting one of the notable observations often made by surveillance operators, "Target is flying nearly in a straight line." How then, can such a feature be incorporated?

Should the subjective knowledge override the numerical information? Wang and Mendel [32,33] attempted to combine numerical information and li-nguistic IF-THEN rules. They converted input-output numerical data pairs into fuzzy rules and combined with the rest of other linguistic rules. But, such a transformation of multisource information to a common frame of discernment tends to adversely obscure objective knowledge due to the influence by subjective information. Considering this, we decided to adopt the Zadeh's definition of a probability of a fuzzy event [34], as shown below:  P(A) - A i- I A(x)dP E(AA) (3-3) where P is a probability measure over Rn, probability space - (Rn,E,P), A e S, x e Rn, and PA denotes a membership function of A. Here, we interpret the probability density function of a fuzzy set, A as a probability dens-ity modulated by a membership function; MA(X)f(x), where dP-f(x)dx.

Thus, the modification to JPDA includes: defining a membership function to encode the statement 'nearly straight line, " and modulating the association probabilities by a membership function  Pi. PDn.(-PD)N-n. m. lgij(vj)j fj(Ai) where fii(Aij) is a function of the difference in directions. Here, we chose the functional form of a Gaussian given by  fij - exp(tijjTogA-&ifj) (3-4) where ao is the variance of target heading. The angle difference, ij between the measurement direction and predicted direction at the kth scan determines the membership grade.

Unfortunately, in many cases, the direction of measurement is not directly obtained, and thus a pseudo direction needs to be generated. One possible approach is to compute the direction by connecting the measurement point with the previous predicted target position, X(k-llk-2) or another possibility is to compute an average heading from the past predicted headings (3 or 5). In section 4, we discuss performance comparison of these various data associa- tion algorithms.

3.2. Multisensor Track to Track Fusion  In a multiple sensor environment, two different types of processing architectures are often employed: sensor level and central level tracking [21,23]. In central level tracking, all of the sensor measurements are transmitted to a central site and processed. In some applications, however, it may be desirable for the measurements are processed at the sensor site instead of transmitting them to the central processor.

The local processed results (local tracks) are then sent over a communication network to be used by the central processor to update system tracks. Most of algorithms developed for single sensor tracking can be  applied to the central tracking scheme while the distributed tracking requires additional processing: to determine whether two tracks are originated by the same target, and if so, to combine two tracks (this is called track-to-track fusion). Track fusion problems have been well studied and published in the literature [21]. Basically, two tracks Xi(k) and Xj(k) are combined by a convex combination as below  Xij (k) - aXi(k) + (1-a)Xj(k) (3-5)  where a - (P-Fj)/(i+Pj -FPij-FPi)j Fi,Pi cross variance, and Pji PijT.

However, this technique also suffers from a problem similar to what we encountered in maneuver target tracking, namely modeling inaccuracy. As shown in equation (3-5), the track fusion is based on the state error covariance matrices and thus if target dynamic does not match the assumed model, the covariance does not provide a good measure of confidence. Even though some algorithms such as JPDA and IMM partly moderate the ill-conditioning of the covariance matrices (that is, premature collapse of a covariance matrix resulting in incorrect weights), model mismatch is a recurring problem. Thus, it is desirable to have a rule based track fusion logic.

Following control rules have been formed from a few salient features observed on situation display consoles.

Although NJPDA does not show any bias problem, target 1 and 2 are not able to be resolved as illustrated in figure 4.3(b)  From the above simulation results, we observe the following. Fuzzy logic' and rule based systems are a means of dealing with imprecision, a method of model- ing human behavior, and a means of achieving control  of industrial systems that cannot be modeled rigorous- ly. The principal difference from the conventional techniques is that the fuzzy approach uses qualitative information. We have implemented a fuzzy tracker based on the existing ac-P smoothing algorithm and developed a subjective knowledge augmented data asso- ciation algorithms. An intuitive reason why the fuzzy logic provides better performance is the fuzzified decision boundaries resulting in a weighted average of possible decision rules, and utilization of informa- tion features that cannot be easily quantified or are overlooked in conventional techniques. However, -it should be noted that the fuzzy method requires compre- hensive knowledge acquisition to formulate a success- ful rule base. Other factors including a proper cali- bration technique and judicious choice of membership functions are crucial in designing a good fuzzy sys- tem.
