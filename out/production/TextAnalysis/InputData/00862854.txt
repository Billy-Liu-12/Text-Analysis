Abstract: How to deal with the very large database in supply chain management is a very important problem. Mining association rule and sequential patterns from Large Database has been recognized by many researchers in Database systems and many other related management areas recently. In this paper, the necessary of researching on data mining of supply chain is introduced first, then the four stages of the implementation of data mining are given. Nevertheless many previous  works were focused on mining association rules in transaction database and sequential pattems at a single concept level, there exists many phenomenon of multiple level sequence patterns in practice. An effective multiple sequence patterns  mining algorithm is raised in this paper. A case study is discussed lastly.
