Abstract We present a conceptual network model for the organization of courseware and the related information.

Using the hierarchy and akociation rules of the concepts, we organize components and courseware episodes as a multi-layer howledge network, which has a reasonable classijkation and discloses the complicated interdependent relations among the knowledge. K th  retrieval based on concept and association among concepts, people can manage and develop courseware, and lead the course for self-organizing and stu@.

1. Introduction  CAI courseware has gained a rapid development in recent years. However, in comparison with the rapid expansion and development of knowledge, there are still highly demands on courseware which require courseware can adapt its schemes and contents according to teaching requirements. Recently, the technology of building a network component database has been introduced [l, 21. Each component consists of teaching materials and modes of. statement.

Courseware combined with an adaptive network components editor platform has great convenience in fully using of WWW educational resource. But the organization of teaching materials and the choice of model of statement are challenge tasks and still rely on expert?s personal style of instruction and the specific syllabus. On one hand, there is no sufficient suggestion on how to organize the teaching materials for educator  to design a course. On the other hand, a guide on system and structure of knowledge is needed to satisfy with the varied demands of students [3]. It is doubtless that a flexible knowledge association system should be introduced.

In this paper, we present a new architecture to organize courseware based. on the knowledge conceptual network [6]. The framework of system is made up of knowledge described by conceptual network, teaching material associated with knowledge, rule, and pattem of information. Conceptual network shows the interdependent relationships among the concepts.

Teaching information consists of episodic courseware that uses concept as it basic unit and related material.

Each piece of information links a certain concept in conceptual network. Thus the information is formed into a knowledge network.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly introduces the conceptual network. Section 3 discusses the organization of courseware episodes based on the conceptual network. CAI Courseware Architecture and push engine of course are provided in Section 4 and conclude the paper in Section 5 .

2. Conceptual Network (CN)  Conceptual network (CN) is used to model and expresses the inherent relationship among objective things (concepts). Through concepts and conceptual relations it describes human?s natural understanding of the laws of the world. Conceptual network can be defined as a 5-tuple: N{C, A, B, D, Kr}, where C  0-7803-7925-X/03/$17.00 02003 IEEE 1288    denotes the concept words set, A denotes the attributes sets, B denotes the behavior set, D is the documents set which describes the concept in a multimedia form. Kr  describes the knowledge units. Fig. 1 shows a node  Knowledge relevancy  Figure 1. The node model of concept  relations among conceptual ?s component structure.

CN is a very complex knowledge system. For courseware we only discuss some relevant techniques in CN: Concept node design and ID: Each concept (word) should be given an ID, and each concept is associated with name and synonymy set. ID is a unique number to represent a concept. A concept may have several (synonymy) terms, which are recorded in the synonymy set, but they all map to the identical ID.

Each concept may have generalization, intension and extension as well as the regulations. When define the intention of concept we should centralize them. Using the visible hierarchical relation we can make a compact structure and deal the knowledge with categorizing.

Attribute and behavior of concept: Attributes characterize the inherent feature of a concept.

Behaviors show the outside features. The general features can be abstracted and formed a higher level of concept that may posses more extension or general meanings. Both attributes and behaviors serve as the foundation of classification for the concept.

Presentation of a concept: A concept may be presented with variable types of media forms such as text, image, video, hyperlink and U?U etc. All these presentations can be used as the original material in the information service.

Concept relevancy: As a concept may involve many concepts, a concept representation could be very complex. They have different function in a conceptual  graph, and they play different roles in the knowledge sentence. All the relevance forms a network links, thus the conceptual network expresses some kind of knowledge with complex associations among the concepts.

Structure of the conceptual network: For the preciseness representation and flexible management of a conceptual network, the concept is applied with a tree structure. We first build a backbone tree, and then based on this tree, we add concept nodes and associations (links) among the nodes. In this way, complex conceptual combination boils down to clear structure without losing precise meanings and representations. The backbone tree is expanded according to hierarchy of knowledge system. There are several kinds of affiliation in classification method that may be used to expand a node in higher layer:  0 Common - special. The child node is ?a-kind-of? its parent. This relation shows difference on attribute, behave, goal, mode, effect etc.

Entire-part. The parent is composed of some parts, such as components, elements, and steps of scheme or process. The child node has ?a-part-of ? relation between higher layer and lower layer.

0 Class-instance. Using the ?is-an-instance? relation, we can derive an embodiment conceptual node from a generic abstract node      in application.

Recombination. The child nodes derived from parent by ?a-kind-of? mode can recombined   3. Courseware episodes organization  There are very complicated relationships among concepts. The CN treat these relationships as two kinds, one is subordinated, from the view of inheritance and combination of class; the other is dependence, from the view of entire presentation of knowledge.

General speaking, the concept tree shows the subordinated relationships, which are detail ?A Kind of?, ?A part of?, ?A  classified in Instance of?.

and become new child node. It consists of some attributes or other in branches but only one in same character.

However, multi-parent is very common in oriented object. The concept has also multi-inherited and can has more than one parent concept. As concerned as the problem, we decided the concept from which current concept inherited the main attribute is direct parent node, while the concept whose auxiliary attributes are inherited are limited node. By this way the subordinated relationships are clear and definite. Fig2 shows the example of ?Function pointer?.

Figure 2 Associated limited multi-parent relationship  The more common and complicated relationships among the concepts are the association when certain action occurs, which we call dependence association based on role. h e  set composed of several concepts according to certain rule, represents certain knowledge  that described the effect made by one object act another object when, where and under other condition.

The concepts parted in the combination act respective role and are called role concepts. The fig3 shows that among the concept ?write file? and other role concepts.

An engine for navigation should be designed for the learners. The  engine has four basic functions: 1)The synthesis of web presentation: Web page synthesis combines one or several conceptual courseware episodes to a multi-frame web page. Both the combination of page and the link of knowledge are     processed according to the concept?s association rules.

The hierarchy and association in the CN are the base of the concept?s association rules. According to the difference of priority among sub-concept, sibling concept, parent-coneept and associated concepts, there are four learning modes: deep mode, extensive mode, generalization mode and association mode. As for the unknown knowledge, a previous mode is suggested, while in review the rest two modes are suitable. The different learning modes have different synthesis strategy of web page. The layout of a web page is guided by the pattern of web constitutes, such as CSS style, the learners are free to choose his favorite web layout.

Figure 4 shows the architecture of a courseware generating system based on conceptual network. In  lines of CN and the conceptual tree, the system is able to generate courseware episodes which interpret knowledge from CN with association rules and provide instances of knowledge with multimedia presentations.

Those information units may serve as the basic elements to form the web page and present in the web for learning. Generating web-presentation can be done through mark-up languages such as HTMLKML based on knowledge and database for convenience of information retrieval. Thus the modification on the file of knowledge is shifted to the modification of web page. Giving the file name and index number of all the episodes of courseware are assembled by the knowledge system. Hyperlinks of reference knowledge about certain pieces of knowledge are also included in courseware episodes.

2)Thepush of course: The push of learning course is for the beginners. For example, in ?C based on four factors: teaching strategy, hierarchy Programming Language?, the ?pointer? is a structure in the CN, knowledge association in the CN sub-concept of ?data type?, but ?pointer? and the study history record of the learners. should not be studied immediately after ?data  type? has been studied, because ?pointer? is a very important and difficult part and is studied only if the preliminary knowledge has been  Teaching strategy. The learning of each course shall have its own order, the system should also present the course by the order, especial     studied. According to the teaching strategy, the ?pointer? node at the navigating tree is disable when the learners are studying the ?data type?.

Hierarchy and association in the CN. General speaking, according to the weight in navigating there is one descending order list: sub-concepts, sibling concepts, parent concept and associated concepts.?The sub-concepts can lead the learners to lengthwise deep study the details, the sibling nodes can extend the scope, while the parent node can generalize all the studied.

Knowledge association. The other concepts related to this concept are listed in its ?Kr? fields. The concepts act the roles such as limit, action, object, effect, way, place, etc in the composition of knowledge.

0 The history study record of learners. The learners? ability and weakness in the study can be known from the history record. By analyzing the study history the system can have a better personalizing service.

3)  Navigation with conceptual network: This procedure consists of formulation of the knowledge on several databases in Fig. 4. With the starting concept, i.e., the concept to?6e learnt, we apply the association and analysis rules in the corresponding databases. The leamer system thus can be implemented through navigation functions and can be linked with courseware episodes. At the same time, routing through the dynamic concepts the paths are recorded for conceptual diflksion and dynamic conceptual navigation. The routes for the visiting concepts are also recorded. As a result, the concepts, episodes and visiting routes in the CN are presented by home-page generating rules. Thus, the system as integration can help a learner to study the related (association) contents. In this way, multi-concept information auto-adaptive retrieval is realized. More specifically, let C, be the nodes that have been learnt (visited) and a set of association functions applied on C, be R,, then  the association nodes to C, can be defined as follows: Child nodes (mode A: specialization); the parent nodes (mode B: induction); the sibling nodes (mode C: extension) and the nodes that link to C, through R,.

(mode D, E).

Using child node for example, a learner may derive learning knowledge by using deep first or width-fist search in the CN. Thus vertical or horizontal knowledge associations are established. It can be seen that the parent-son nodes form the vertical learning process and the sibling nodes forms the horizontal study process. However, the real learning process must be a hybrid of vertical, horizontal and other learning rules in the CN rather than only in the tree.

With vertical learning process, concepts and knowledge may be studied form level by level. Once the knowledge has been learnt in one level, that is, all the sibling nodes have been leamt, to generalize the concept and recommend a set of parent nodes that are suitable to the learns would be possible. We also setup the learning priority by  where Nb is the number of sibling nodes, Nrb is the number of learnt sibling. The priority of related nodes is determined by  k = N,.JNp where Np is the number of node that link to R, ER,., Nrp is the number of learnt nodes.

4) Dynamic creation of conceptual baseline:  k = N,.d!b  Keywords and conceptual baseline. When learners type a keyword, just like using in search engine, the system will consider this word as an object that the user may be interested in. Through the term-concept mapping of conceptual network and finding the concept?s corresponding node in CN, documents of conceptual description and association function of related knowledge will be brought forth to the learner. If there is more     than one concepts mapping to a keyword, the system can provide all of them or give a prompt for the user to decide which path to learn. Thus we called the path as the conceptual baseline.

Multi-keywords and conceptual baseline. That learners may enter several keywords at the same time, which indicates that the users may have interest in leaming a series of objects, so some key words may be inter-related. Using the keyword-concept mapping approach (through association rules), a leamer may navigate many concepts through these given concepts. Consequently, the corresponding web page generation should take into consideration of the ?shortest? relation paths among the multiple keywords (concepts).

Not fully like in the Internet, navigation in a courseware requests learners concentrating on one piece of knowledge and needn?t much correlated information. Therefore the compacted conceptual baseline is more suitable than conceptual network in courseware design. For a node with multi-level of paternity, it is better to treat the higher nodes as a domain restriction or context. The main descriptions of knowledge will be focused on child node. For example, ?computer?, ?keyboard? can be comprehended as ?the keyboard of computer?. While ?musical instrument?, ?keyboard? is thought as ?the keyboard of musical instrument?, such as keyboard of piano   5. Conclusions ? ,  Organizing CAI courseware with conceptual network has the advantage of traceable conceptual paths and association rules. With our system, it is possible to organize the pedagogical knowledge and conceptual  association adaptively by guessing leamerk intentions, indicate a reasonable direction for further study so as to implement so called ?intelligent instruction system?.

The further work of the system is to record individual history (trace) information and data after learner logins into study, so that leamers can be elicited to go over related important contents during in new study phase even if they need review. The problem can be solved by design of adaptive reasonable refresh factor for different leamers in CN, which will surely enhance the intelligence of the system.
