Analyzing and Relieving the Impact of FCD Traffic in LTE-VANET Heterogeneous Network

Abstract?Floating car data (FCD) application is an urban sensing application, which collects the status (position, velocity and heading) of vehicles to feed a traffic management server and estimate the travel time of vehicles, and can be carried by long term evolution (LTE) or a heterogeneous network composed by LTE and vehicular ad hoc network (VANET). However, this application is characterized by high frequency and small data size, which occupy network resource frequently and may have an impact on other LTE traffic, such as human to human (H2H) traffic, which is characterized by low frequency and big data size. In this paper, we aim to analyze and reduce the impact of FCD traffic on the H2H traffic in a LTE-VANET heterogeneous network. For this purpose, we design a novel FCD transmission scheme and evaluate its impact on H2H traffic, which is represented by the rise of the blocking ratio of the H2H traffic, through a Markovian model. The results of the model show that comparing with other schemes, the novel scheme has a relatively lower impact on the traditional cellular traffic, H2H traffic.



I. INTRODUCTION  Vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) is a type of vehicular communication network, which uses vehicles as elements in a mobile ad hoc network to realize vehicle-to-vehicle com- munication through 802.11p [1]. Several sorts of applications can run on this kind of network to make traffic environment safer and more intelligent and improve people?s life during their journey. Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication network is another emerging type of vehicular communication network, which is composed by not only vehicles but also roadside units. However, ubiquitous roadside unit deployment costs are very expensive. Future vehicles are likely to have cellular communication modules, so replacing roadside units by ready-made cellular network infrastructures, i.e. base s- tations, seems to be an another approach to achieving V2I communication. In fact, a lot of articles [2]?[5] have designed and studied cellular-VANET heterogeneous network to support V2I communication. However, the previous works mainly studied the feasibility of such kind of heterogeneous network and how to improve its V2I communication performance by various kinds of technologies, such as cluster. The negative impact of supporting V2I traffic in the heterogeneous network on the performance of the traditional cellular traffic, human to human (H2H) traffic, was ignored. For example, float car data (FCD) traffic transmission through cellular network may have impact on H2H traffic. FCD application is an urban sensing application, which collects the status (position, velocity and heading) of vehicles to feed a traffic management server and estimate the travel time of vehicles. This type of V2I traffic is characterized by high frequency and small data size. In each second, each car in a cell should transmit its status to base  station, which is a strong influence on H2H traffic.

The contributions of this paper are listed below. We first  evaluate the negative impact of one kind of V2I traffic, i.e.

FCD traffic, on H2H traffic in a cellular-VANET heterogeneous network composed by long term evolution (LTE) and VANET through a Markovian model. Second, we design a novel FCD transmission scheme to reduce the negative impact on H2H traffic and evaluate its performance by the Markovian model.

The results of the Markovian model show that the novel transmission scheme can significantly reduce the negative impact on the H2H traffic.

The paper is organized as follows. In section II we briefly discuss previous related work. The scenario of LTE-VANET heterogeneous network and FCD traffic are described in section

III. How to evaluate the negative impact of FCD traffic on H2H traffic through Markovian model is introduced in section IV. In section V, the novel FCD transmission scheme, which prevents unnecessary FCD transmission of some vehicles and avoids transmitting FCD data from some vehicles in bad LTE channel condition to LTE base station, i.e. eNodeB, is described. Then, the impacts of different kinds of FCD transmission schemes on the H2H traffic are compared by investigating the blocking ratio of the H2H traffic in section VI. Finally, a conclusion is drawn in section VII.



II. RELATED WORK  In the area of V2I communication, there have been a lot of articles about heterogeneous network. In [2], an LTE-VANET heterogeneous network was designed. In the network, some vehicles are selected as gateway between LTE and VANET, and then coalition game theory was applied to stimulate other vehicles to join coalition, which has a gateway and some other vehicles, to ensure the proper functioning of the LTE-VANET heterogeneous network. In [3], the cluster head selection prob- lem in LTE-VANET heterogeneous network was discussed. In [4], an architecture that integrates 3G/UMTS networks with VANET was introduced, and the authors aimed at selecting a minimum number of gateways. All above mentioned three papers provide appropriate architectures of cellular-VANET heterogeneous network. They focused on the structure design and gateway organization. However, they did not discuss in detail the performance of some vehicular application in those architectures, in spite of [4], in which FTP traffic was evaluated. Authors in [6] scanned and discussed some work and running standardization about using LTE to support vehicular communication, and strengths and weaknesses of LTE as an enabling technology for vehicular communications were analyzed.

In [5], an LTE-VANET heterogeneous network, LTE4V2X,      Fig. 1. LTE-VANET heterogeneous network.

was introduced to support FCD data collection. In [7] [8], an FCD data collection scheme through LTE network was designed. The authors used Markovian model to evaluate the impact of FCD traffic on the LTE traditional H2H traffic.

However, vehicle to vehicle communication isn?t used to reduce the negative impact of FCD traffic. In [9], vehicle to vehicle communication was applied to enhance the down- link and uplink connectivity of cellular network. However, this paper didn?t analyze the negative impact of vehicular application on intrinsic H2H traffic.



III. THE SCENARIO  In this paper, we assume that all vehicles can communicate not only with eNodeB through LTE interface but also with each other through 802.11p interface. The bandwidth of LTE is 10MHz, i.e. 50 resource blocks (RBs). Vehicles, mobile phone users and eNodeBs constitute a heterogeneous network as shown in fig. 1. Some adjacent vehicles compose a cluster, in which one cluster head is selected. Only the cluster head enables its LTE module, and acts as a gateway between other vehicles and eNodeB. We consider that the cluster structure and the selection of cluster head are controlled by the eNodeB [5]. FCD is some important information about vehicles, which is composed by localization data, velocity, diving direction and time information. In the heterogeneous network, Vehicles send their FCD data to their cluster head, and then the cluster head compresses those FCD data and forwards the compressed data to eNodeB. Those kinds of information are collected to feed a traffic management server, which sense urban traffic condition and do dynamic traffic prognosis. Besides vehicles, there are some mobile phone users in the scenario who communicate with the eNodeB directly. In this scenario, FCD application is characterized by high frequency and small data size, which occupy network resource frequently and may have an impact on other LTE traffic, i.e. H2H traffic, which is characterized by low frequency and big data size.



IV. SYSTEM MODEL  For the purpose of evaluating the impact of FCD traffic on H2H traffic, we apply an efficient system model, which have three elements: a laboratory setup, a simulation of the distribution of channel condition of a cell and a Markovian model. First, in the laboratory setup, we measure uplink data rates for a single user in case of distinct signal to noise ratios (SNRs) and one RB. Then, the distribution of channel  Fig. 2. Uplink data rate vs. SNR for one RB per user.

At last, the performance of H2H traffic in an LTE cell is modeled through a Markovian model. In the model, the traffic of mobile phone user is video streaming, and the traffic of vehicle is FCD (see table I).

A. Laboratory Measurement Setup  In the laboratory, we can achieve close-to-reality investi- gations of the data transmission between users and eNodeBs without expensive field trials. The parameters for the mea- surements are listed in table II. The setup composed of A LTE base station, a channel emulator, and an LTE broadband card connected with a computer. Adaptive modulation and coding are applied on the LTE base station. The velocity of user can be set on the channel emulator. In fig. 2, the data rates as a function of SNR for 1 RB per user are described.

B. SNR Estimation by Combined Path loss and Shadowing  In this subsection, we estimate SNR distribution in a cell by simulation with standardized parameters and formulas in [10].

The SNR value is the signal strength of useful signal to the signal strength of noise and interference, which is described by the formula below,  ? = P ? PL ? Fshadow  ?2 + I , (1)  where P is the transmit power of the user. PL is the path loss between the eNB of cell c and user u, and Fshadow is the shadow fading. ?2 is the addictive white Gaussian noise. I is the signal strength of interference.

Considering a carrier frequency of 2GHz and a base station      TABLE III.

antenna height of 15m, the propagation model is given by the following formula [10]:  PL = 128.1 + 37.6log10(R), (2)  where R is distance between eNodeB and user. Besides, the shadow fading is assumed to be following log-normal distri- bution with standard deviation 10dB. Some other parameters are listed in table III. The simulation result is shown in the fig. 3.

For the sake of analysis, we classify the users according to the SNR into three parts with the same number.

? SNR ? 3.13 dB: represented by 0.2dB SNR (weighted average)  ? 3.13 dB < SNR ? 10.39 dB: represented by 6.5dB SNR ? 10.39 dB < SNR: represented by 15.4dB SNR Users are classified into two fractions according to the  velocity, and we assume that velocities of vehicles are equally divided between the two velocity fractions.

? v ? 90 km/h: represented by 60 km/h ? 90 km/h < v: represented by 120 km/h  C. Analytical Markovian Model  In this subsection, we use Markovian model to study different resource requirements of mobile phone users and vehicles in an analytical way.

Firstly we consider a scenario where FCD data is trans- mitted from vehicle to eNodeB directly. It is assumed that the traffic of mobile phone users and vehicles all follow a Poisson distribution and the service durations of two types of users all follow a negative exponential distribution. The resource requirements of mobile phone users or vehicles in the above mentioned six kinds of channel conditions (three different SNRs and two different velocities) are modeled by six  ??? ????? ? ? ??? 	????  ??  ? ?       ? ? =  +?  ??  ? ?       ? ? =  + ?  ? ?? ?+  ? ?? ?+? ? ? ?+  ? ?? ?+  ? ?? ?+  ? ?? ?+  ??  ??

The arrival rates of H2H users in six kinds of channel condi- tions are ?1, ?2 ... ?6, and ?7, ?8 ... ?12 represent the arrival rates of V2I users in six kinds of channel conditions. Because mobile phone users and vehicles are averagely classified into the six types respectively, ?1, ?2 ... ?6 are all equal to ?u/6 and ?7, ?8 ... ?12 are all equal to ?v/6, where ?u and ?v are the arrival rate of mobile phone user and vehicle respectively. The service rate for the H2H users, ?1, ?2 ... ?6, are all set to 1 per second while the RB requirements are adjusted by the channel conditions. For V2I users, the RB requirement is fixed number (10 RBs), while the service rates ?7, ?8 ... ?12 are the data rate measurements in six distinct channel conditions divided by the data size (1 kByte). The arrival rates, the service rates and the numbers of required RB of twelve Markovian chain models is presented in table IV.

The total RB consumption of all users is modeled by a combination of twelve one-dimensional Markovian models. By using the dimension reduction method provided in [11], the total RB consumption in an LTE cell by users with different RB requirements can be modeled as a one-dimensional Markovian model as shown in fig. 4. If the free RB number in the cell is no smaller than the number of RBs required by a user, the cell will allocate the RBs to the user. Otherwise the requirement from the user will be rejected. The probability that n RBs are used by all users can be respected by the stationary distribution q(n) in [11]. q(n) is determined by the recursive formula below,  q(n) = ?Ss=1 as ? bs n  ? q(n? bs) s = 0, 1, ..., S, (3) where q(n) = 0 for n < 0 and ?Ns=1q(n) = 1. S is the number of service types, i.e. dimensions of the model. as = ?s ? ?s is the type s offered load. bs is the number of RB required by type s. N is the total number of RB of an LTE cell.

Fig. 5. The novel FCD transmission scheme.

The blocking probability Pbs of type s can be calculated as,  Pbs = ? N n=N?bs+1q(n) n = 1, 2, ..., N (4)  Using formula (3) and (4), we can calculate the impact of V2I traffic on H2H traffic, i.e. the blocking ratio of H2H traffic in case of different V2I traffic density.

Secondly we consider a scenario that M vehicles which are adjacent can compose a cluster, and in each cluster, one cluster head is selected, which collects the FCD data from cluster members and compresses as well as relays it to LTE base station, i.e. eNodeB. Then each vehicle has the probability of 1/M to be selected as a cluster head, and the arrival ratio of cluster head is ?v/M . As mentioned above, the FCD data of one vehicle is 1 kByte, so the FCD data needed to be sent by a cluster head is M kBytes. Cluster heads compress data of cluster members before sending it to the eNodeB.

The compression ratio is ?. The regular running of cluster architecture needs control data. We define ? as the result of dividing the size of FCD date by the size of FCD and control data. As a result, the service rates of the cluster heads are ?7??M ?? , ?8?? M ?? ,...

?12?? M ?? . By using formula (3) and (4), we can calculate  the impact of V2I traffic on H2H traffic, i.e. the blocking ratio of H2H traffic in case of different V2I traffic density, when FCD data is compressed and relayed to eNodeB by cluster heads.



V. A NOVEL FCD TRANSMISSION SCHEME  In this section, we provide a novel FCD transmission scheme in LTE-VANET heterogeneous network, as shown in fig. 5. The scheme comprises two components. The first one is avoiding some valueless FCD data transmission. Second, se- lecting the optimal cluster head, i.e. gateway, of the cluster can cut down the RB consumption of V2I traffic and consequently reduce the negative impact of V2I traffic on H2H traffic.

Firstly, we design an algorithm to avoid useless FCD data transmission. When the velocity and direction of a vehicle is unchanged between two FCD data samplings, the second FCD data is valueless. It is because the location information, velocity information and the direction information in the FCD data can be used to predict the condition of the vehicle in  TABLE V. CLUSTER HEADS INFORMATION  SNR[dB] (v)[km/h] arrival ratio ? ? bs CH1 15.4 60 (217/4800)*?v 40 10 CH2 15.4 120 (7/4800)*?v 36 10 CH3 6.5 60 (217/4800)*?v 20 10 CH4 6.5 120 (7/4800)*?v 19 10 CH5 0.2 60 (217/4800)*?v 8 10 CH6 0.2 120 (7/4800)*?v 7 10  the following FCD data samplings. A vehicle can compare its condition and the prediction by their last FCD data. If the error isn?t large than a threshold ?, the vehicle needn?t generate a new FCD data. Otherwise the vehicle generates a new FCD data and sends it to cluster head or eNodeB. ? is composed by ?l, ?v and ?d, which represent the maximum tolerable error values of the prediction of location, velocity and driving direction, respectively. We observed the traces of several taxis for a long observation period through GPS system to calculate the ratio of valueless FCD data. We found that the ratio depends on road shape and traffic condition. Assigning ?l = 2m, ?v = 5km/h, ?d = 10o and frequency of FCD data 1Hz, the ratio of valueless FCD data ? is range from 10% to 50% in different road shapes and traffic conditions.

When generation of valueless FCD data is avoided, the arrival rate of cluster head drops to (1? ?) ? ?v/M .

Secondly, selecting the optimal cluster head, which has the best LTE channel condition (the lowest velocity and the highest SNR), can cut down the RB consumption of V2I traffic and consequently reduce the negative impact of V2I traffic on H2H traffic. Because cluster numbers are adjacent to each other, we assume that the SNRs of cluster numbers are within same SNR fraction, and the velocities of cluster numbers are within two different velocity fractions, v ? 90 km/h and 90 km/h < v. Therefore, the optimal cluster head is the vehicle with the lowest velocity. As mentioned above, the velocities of vehicles are equally divided between the two velocity fractions. If vehicles are randomly compose a cluster with size M , then the probability that at least one cluster number?s velocity is within the first velocity fraction is 1 ? (1/2)M . After the optimal cluster head selection, the ratio of the arrival ratio of cluster head with velocity within the first fraction and the arrival ratio of cluster head with higher velocity is 1 ? (1/2)M : (1/2)M . Then the arrival rates of cluster heads in six kinds of channel conditions are [1?(1/2)  M ]?(1??)??v 3?M ,  (1/2)M ?(1??)??v 3?M ,  [1?(1/2)M ]?(1??)??v 3?M ,  (1/2)M ?(1??)??v 3?M ,  [1?(1/2)M ]?(1??)??v 3?M ,  (1/2)M ?(1??)??v 3?M respec-  tively. It is quite clear that the arrival rate of cluster head with bad LTE channel condition, i.e. high velocity, declines.



VI. RESULTS  In this section, we assume that M=5, ?=0.3 ?=0.4 (in tar-gzip format) and ?=0.7 [5] and present the parameters of Markovian models for different FCD transmission schemes in table IV and V. The blocking probability of H2H or V2I traffic vs. arrival rate of V2I devices for different FCD transmission schemes are calculated and shown in fig. 6 or fig. 7. There are four FCD transmission schemes. The first one is transmitting the FCD data from vehicle to eNodeB directly. The second one is a channel sensitive transmission scheme (CST) [8], in which some vehicles in bad channel condition (high velocity and low SNR) transmit FCD to eNodeB directly with a lower      Fig. 6.

probability than in good channel condition (low velocity and high SNR). There are two parameters in CST, ? and ?, to control the intensity of the channel sensitive transmission scheme. In fig. 6 and fig. 7, ? and ? are all set as 0.5. The third one is gathering FCD data by a cluster head, which transmit the gathered FCD to eNodeB. The forth one is similar to the third one. The difference is in the forth scheme, we cut down RB consumption of FCD data by avoiding some useless FCD data and selecting the optimal cluster head (AU&OCH). Comparing the curves of the first scheme and the third scheme in fig. 6, it is obviously that transmitting FCD data by combining LTE and VANET has less impact on H2H traffic than transmitting FCD data by LTE only. The reason for that is cluster head in VANET can compress the FCD data of cluster numbers. It is same why V2I traffic blocking fate fo the third scheme is lower than the first one as shown in fig. 7. It can be seen in fig. 6 or fig. 7 that the blocking probability of H2H or V2I traffic of the second scheme is lower than the first and third schemes. It is because some vehicles in bad channel condition may not generate FCD data to transmit. Compared with other three schemes, the forth one has the best performance since we cut down RB consumption of FCD data by avoiding some useless FCD data and selecting the optimal cluster head.



VII. CONCLUSION  In this paper, a novel FCD transmission scheme in LTE- VANET heterogeneous network is designed. We evaluate the impact of FCD transmission in LTE network and LTE-VANET heterogeneous network on H2H traffic by using a Markovian model and compare our scheme with previous schemes. The results show that compared with other schemes, the novel scheme has a relatively lower negative impact on the con- ventional cellular traffic, H2H traffic. Therefore, by using the novel FCD transmission scheme, H2H traffic and FCD traffic can be served by the LTE network simultaneously and have a relatively smaller impact on each other. However, the impact of FCD on the LTE H2H traffic is reduced at the expense of increasing the overhead on the VANET. In the future, we will analyze the combination of FCD traffic an beacon traffic in VANET to relieving the impact of FCD traffic on VANET.
