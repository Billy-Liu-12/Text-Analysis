A STATISTICAL APPROACH TOWARDS PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF MULTIMODAL BIOMETRIC SYSTEMS

ABSTRACT  This paper investigates the application of statistical methods in performance analysis of multimodal biometric systems. It develops an efficient and systematic approach to evaluate sys- tem performance under the influence of errors. Based upon the proposed approach, 126 experiments are conducted with the BSSR1 dataset on typical fusion methods using different normalization techniques. Experiment results demonstrate that the Simple Sum fusion method yields the best overall per- formance when working with Min-Max normalization. More importantly, further examination of experimental results re- veals the need for systematic analysis of system performance as the performance of some fusion methods may exhibit big variations when the level of errors changes, and some fusion methods may produce very good performance in some appli- cation though normally unacceptable in others.

1. INTRODUCTION  Biometric systems use physical and behavior characteristics to establish individual identities. The physical characteristics of human beings take account of those traits that range from fingerprint, palmprint, hand geometry, face, ear, iris, retina, to DNA structure; and behavioral characteristics further cover the dynamics of voice, gait, signature, and keystrokes. In comparison to ID cards and passwords used in token-based or knowledge-based approaches, biometric traits can neither be stolen nor forgotten as they are distinctive and inherent attributes of each of the human beings [3]. Biometric sys- tems, therefore, are more accurate, reliable, and capable in applications that require high rate of correct personnel iden- tification, including national security, criminal investigation, access control, and medical service.

A typical biometric system accomplishes the task of per- sonnel identification in four steps to acquire the trait in the form of raw biometric data, to extract a feature set with com- pact representation of the trait, to generate a matching score by comparing the extracted feature set against those in the template, and finally to decide the acceptance or rejection  This work was supported by Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada.

of an identity [9]. Moreover, multimodal biometric systems make use of the information from multiple sources to over- come the inherent limitations of unimodal biometric systems as an effort to improve system performance in the presence of sensory noise, intra-class variations, inter-class similarities, non-universality, and/or spoof attacks [5].

Multimodal biometric systems integrate data from inde- pendent biometric devices by means of information fusion, which may take place at feature, score, or decision levels. Al- though information fusion in the early stage is supposed to be effective, but researchers find it difficulty to conduct in- vestigation due to problems including the inaccessibility of feature vectors from most commercial systems. In compar- ison, fusion in the late stage is the least effective, and often produces worse results than the best unimodal biometric sys- tems. Fusion at the score level, consequently, becomes the most common approach in multimodal biometrics for advan- tages such as the accessibility of information for processing [13].

Nevertheless, there has been a number of different fu- sion methods, and the performance of each fusion method varies in practice. For systematic evaluation of system per- formance, this paper proposes a statistical approach of per- formance analysis, and studies the operation of multimodal biometric systems when different normalization methods are used in different fusion methods. Based upon the standard data set from the National Institute of Standards and Technol- ogy, noise is added at different levels to simulate real-world practice. The study shows that some combinations of normal- ization methods in a couple of fusion methods demonstrate consistent performances under different noise conditions, and they are therefore suitable for practical applications.

2. A STATISTICAL APPROACH OF PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS  Shown in Fig. 1 is the framework of information fusion in a multimodal biometric system. Prior to combining different scores, normalization is necessary to make scores compati- ble, to standardize numerical scales, and to regulate probabil- ity distributions. For fusion at the score level, Eq.. 1 describes the relationship between matching scores (S) and the posterior  Proceedings of the 2008 IEEE Bangkok, Thailand, February 21 - 26, 2009     nfc1 ? ? ? nfcj ? ? ? nfcm nfv1,1 ? ? ? nfv1,j ? ? ? nfv1,m nf1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?  nfvl,1 ? ? ? nfvl,j ? ? ? nfvl,m nfl ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?  cf1 ? ? ? cfk ? ? ? cfu nfvv,1 ? ? ? nfvv,j ? ? ? nfvv,m nfv / mean S/N Ratio cfc1 cfv1,1 ? ? ? cfv1,k ? ? ? cfv1,u r1,1 ? ? ? r1,j ? ? ? r1,m r1,m+1 r1,m+2 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? cfci cfvi,1 ? ? ? cfvi,k ? ? ? cfvi,u ri,1 ? ? ? ri,j ? ? ? ri,m ri,m+1 ri,m+2 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? cfcn cfvn,1 ? ? ? cfvn,k ? ? ? cfvn,u rn,1 ? ? ? rn,j ? ? ? rn,m rn,m+1 rn,m+2  Table 1.

In the equation, f is a mono- tonic function, and ?(X?) is the error made by the biometric system related to the input biometric sample. This error could be due to sensory noise and/or inaccuracy introduced during feature extraction and matching processes [16].

S = f(P (genuine|X?)) + ?(X?) (1)  The isolation of error from input biometric sample allows Fig. 1 to be simplified at an abstract level to a schematic dia- gram in Fig. 2. For any fusion method of a multimodal bio- metric system, it makes decisions of personnel identification by processing normalized biometric inputs under the influ- ence of operational imprecision. In the process, the use of biometric inputs and processing techniques are selectable, but errors caused by operational imprecision are beyond the con- trol of system designers. The performance of a multimodal biometric system, consequently, depends on the chosen fusion method that uses properly selected normalization methods to produce decisions that are the least affected by errors.

Multimodal Biometric System  For the purpose of systematic performance analysis, an evaluation matrix can be constructed with both the control- lable method selection and uncontrollable error influence. As shown in Table 1, this matrix consisting of three regions. The left region contains u controllable factors (cf), n combina- tions of the controllable factors (cfc), and an n ? u array of their combination values (cfv). Similarly, the right-upper re- gion contains v uncontrollable error factors (nf), m combina- tions of the uncontrollable error factors (nfc), and a v ? m array of their combination values (nfv). The right-lower re- gion is an array R whose elements ri,j , 1 ? i ? n and 1 ? j ? m+2, record experiment results and analysis values.

The impact of operational precision is studied by con- ducting experiments on the configurations that associate all combinations of the controllable method selections with all combinations of the uncontrollable error influence. This pro- cedure simulates the variation in performance of multimodal biometric systems in practical situations, and the results fill the evaluation matrix in its two arrays [cfvi,l] and [nfvk,j], where 1 ? i ? n, 1 ? k ? u, and 1 ? j ? m. Nev- ertheless, the combination of different types of sensory input makes the evaluation matrix too huge to handle when all fu- sion methods are considered with different use of input data and normalization techniques. Fortunately, statistical analysis offers the mechanism to help reducing the size of arrays with orthogonal arrays [11].

Selection of Orthogonal Arrays  The selection of orthogonal arrays is shown in Table 2, in which adjacent variants at the same levels may share the same orthogonal array. For example, the second and third variants at level 2 use the common orthogonal array L4. The orthogonal array L4 has three columns and four rows, and the right-most column is ignored. The use of orthogonal ar- ray can greatly reduce the number of combinations. For four parameters with three variants, for example, the number of combinations is 3?3?3?3=81. In orthogonal array L9, how- ever, the number of combinations is reduced to 9, which is only around 11% of the original.

Using the combination values of controllable and uncon- trollable factors in the orthogonal arrays, experiments are con- ducted to produce results according to pre-determined perfor- mance metrics, such as the typical Genuine Acceptance Rate (GAR) or Failure to Acquire Rate (FAR). Experiment results are then filled into the first m columns of array R. Elements in the next to the last column of arrayR are the means of each row from ri,1 to ri,m, and elements in the last column are cal- culated by using a formula given in Eq. 2, where 1 ? i ? n.

ri,m+2 =  ??? ?10 log( 1m  ?m t=1  r2i,t  ) for HB  ?10 log( 1m ?m  t=1 r i,t) for LB  (2)  Based upon the chosen metrics, those multimodal biomet- ric systems that produce optimal performance in practice can be finally determined with a check of signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio [11]. The signal-to-noise(S/N) ratio is a transformation of the repetition data to another value which measures varia- tions. Typically, three of S/N ratios are applicable depending on the characteristics of the system under evaluation. They are called lower is better (LB), nominal is the best (NB), and higher is better (HB). Evaluations based upon GAR use HB, and evaluations based upon FAR use LB.

3. EXPERIMENTS  There is a number of multimodal biometrics databases re- leased publicly by different organizations or government agen- cies for the purpose of performance evaluation [15]. BSSR1 (Biometric Scores Set - Release I) dataset is chosen in exper- iment for its largest set of different types of matching scores.

factors levels A: partitioning B: normalization C: fusion  1 re-substitution Min-Max Simple Sum 2 hold-out Decimal Scaling Simple Product 3 leave-one-out Z-Score Simple Minimum 4 n/a Median and MAD Simple Maximum 5 n/a Tanh-Estimators BGI * n/a none n/a  Table 3. Controllable Factors and Levels  BSSR1 is comprised of face and fingerprint matching scores from the same set of 517 individuals. For each individual, the dataset contains one comparison score from two right in- dex fingerprints, one score from two left index fingerprints, and two comparison scores from two frontal faces of two separate matchers referred to as ?C? and ?G?. In total, there are four matching scores for each of the 517 subjects (one for each modality). For each modality, there are 517 simi- lar files, each of which consists of 517 genuine scores and 516?517=266,772 imposter scores.

There are three ways to use the BSSR1 dataset [12]. The first is called re-substitution, in which all available data is used for both training and testing. In the second way, or hold- out, the dataset is divided into independent training and test- ing subsets, and the testing dataset is chosen randomly from the initial dataset for testing while the remaining for train- ing. As suggested by its name leave-one-out, the last involves dividing the dataset into multiple different training samples and one testing sample. A single estimation can then be pro- duced as the average of all results. In addition, there are five typical fusion methods and five typical normalization tech- niques. The five methods are Simple Sum, Simple Product, Simple Minimum, Simple Maximum, and BGI; and the five techniques are Min-Max, Decimal Scaling, Z-Score, Median and MAD, and Tanh-Estimators [4].

As symbolized in Table 3, the experiment uses three con- trollable factors to cover the three partitioning methods, five normalization techniques, and five fusion methods separately.

Due to the fact that the BGI method is capable of both nor- malizing and fusing the matching scores, it does not require separate normalization and cannot be combined with parti- tion methods. For the uncontrollable factors, Gaussian noise is added to the original BSSR1 scores in according to Eq. 1 at three levels of 1%, 5%, and 10% to create various affects     1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 a 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 b 1 2 3 2 3 1 3 1 2 c  A B C 1 2 3 3 1 2 2 3 1 d / mean S/N Ratio 1 1 1 1 2 1 2 2 3 1 3 3 4 1 4 4 5 2 1 2 6 2 2 3 7 2 3 4 8 2 5 1 9 3 1 3 10 3 2 4 11 3 4 1 12 3 5 2 13 1 * 5 14 2 * 5  Table 4.

Applying orthogonal arrays to both types of factors sets up the evaluation matrix as in Table 4.

When a biometric system makes binary decisions to ac- cept an authorized enrollee and to reject impostors, it may ei- ther falsely accept impostors or falsely rejects an enrollee. Di- viding the number of false acceptances or false rejections by the number of identification attempts produces the so-called False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and False Rejection Rate (FRR).

Genuine Acceptance Rate (GAR) is the complement of FRR, i.e., GAR=1-FRR. With GAR set at 0.1% FAR, experiment results are recorded in Table 5 at each element ri,j of R, for 1 ? i ? n and 1 ? j ? m. For each row, ri,m+1 is the mean, and ri,m+2 is the S/N ratio. In particular, the signal to noise ratio follows ?the higher the better? (HB) rule in experiments.

4. ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSIONS  Evaluation of a complete biometric system is a comprehen- sive and challenging task [10]. It involves not only the per- formance of matching, engineering, technical, and security issues, but also other aspects such as user?s habituation and privacy. Even for the evaluation of matching performance alone, there are also three general frameworks in categories of technology, scenario, and operational evaluations [7]. If a database can be representative of the user population and the inevitable collection problems can be engineered away or sta- tistically modeled better, it is reasonable and relatively cheap  to compare performance of different biometric matchers with technology evaluations [2].

The first attempt of performance evaluation conducted a huge amount of experiments to characterize performance mea- sures for assessing commercially available face identification systems [1]. Afterward, there have been reports of several other testing on the performance of different biometric sys- tems in specific applications [6, 14], and the newest was in 2007 [8]. There are also reports for the evaluation of normal- ization and fusion techniques of multimodal biometrics sys- tems. For example, a testing method was developed to allow system designers to conduct evaluation by varying different factors like biometric traits, normalization schemes, fusion methods and sample databases [13]. The use of a few sam- ple datasets, however, limits the thoroughness of study due to the lack of systematic investigation of error effects.

After 126 experiments with different combinations of the controllable and uncontrollable factors, different aspects of system performance are examined. Fig. 3 illustrates the re- ceiver operating characteristic curves of the four single modal- ities and the curve after applying the Simple Product fusion method. Experiment results show that multimodal biometrics systems achieve much better performance than any unimodal biometric system. By examining all of the experiment results, it is concluded that a multimodal biometric system is going to produce the best performance if it uses the Simple Sum fusion method with the Min-Max normalization technique, which is combination No. 1 of the controllable factors. This combi- nation has the best GAR performance at 0.1% FAR under the influence of inevitable errors.

Furthermore, a couple of interesting observations can be              a      b      c A  B C      d  /m ea  n S/  N R  at io    .4   .1  .2   .2  .2   .2  .2   .5  .2   .3  .9     .1  .2   .8  .5   .9  .4   .5  .2   .9  .8   .4    .1   .5  .7   .0  .0   .6  .1   .2  .5   .7  .4     .9  .2   .1  .7   .9  .2   .8  .4   .1  .7   .8    .1   .1  .1   .1  .1   .1  .1   .2  .1   .9  .7     .4  .3   .2  .4   .5  .3  .5   .6  .4   .2  .7     .0  .0   .0  .2   .1  .0   .0  .2   .0  .1   .8    .8   .1  .0   .1  .1   .8  .1   .1  .0   .5  .8     .1  .4   .6  .6   .5  .9   .7  .3   .5  .4   .6    .4   .7  .9   .1  .2   .5  .1   .1  .0   .5  .5     .3  .5   .8  .5   .3  .3   .3  .3   .8  .1   .9    .0   .5  .2   .2  .5   .7  .5   .5  .9   .5  .8   *   .5  .1   .5  .7   .2  .7   .5  .4   .2  .7   .8   *  .1   .8  .1   .0  .8   .0  .8   .1  .1   .7  .8   Ta bl  e 5.

E xp  er im  en tR  es ul  ts Fig. 3. Performance of different normalization methods  Fig. 4. Performance of different fusion methods  made by studying the experiment results in Table 5. The first observation is that several combinations of the controllable factors demonstrate consistent performances in all uncontrol- lable error combinations. For example, the performance of combination No.1 varies within a small range of 0.413 be- tween 99.135% and 99.548%, and No.11 within 0.949 be- tween 98.576% and 99.525%. In comparison, all others have significant changes across the board. Most noticeable is the big variations of No. 6 between 81.646% and 91.297%, which is almost in the scale of ten. Similarly, No. 10 has a jump from 71.044% to 79.144%. This observation shows that per- formance evaluation of multimodal biometrics system cannot be done with just a few sample datasets, but have to adopt a systematic approach such as the proposed method.

Another observation is related to the selection of operat-     Fig. 5. Change of GAR with the Change of FAR  ing point GAR. Because GAR is closely related to a specific FAR, its value changes accordingly when the requirement for the FAR is changed by a particular application. For exam- ple, the mean value of GAR at 0.1% FAR is only 83.786% for combination No. 3. However, when the FAR value rises, the GAR hikes rapidly as shown in Fig. 5. This combina- tion may therefore be adopted by the applications that prefer high FAR, such as forensic analysis. This observation shows that unsystematic experiments may not be conclusive. It is not necessary that losers in an experiment cannot perform as good as winners all the time. They may even perform better when the operating point changes in different applications.

5. CONCLUSION  This paper develops a statistical approach for performance analysis of multimodal biometric systems, and presents ex- periment results with the four-modality BSSR1 dataset. The statistical approach enables systematical performance study of different fusion methods and normalization techniques in the presence of errors. In addition, observations made from this study not only identify the fusion methods best in perfor- mance, but also produce useful guidance for the practice of performance analysis. Although only four out of many types of possible biometric information are used in experiment, the method is general and can be applied to applications that re- quire large volume, high-dimensional experiments.
