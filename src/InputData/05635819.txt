I. INTRODUCTION  Nowadays, images are widely used in many fields. People want to see what happens, not just a result. So video capture and display is important more and more. We can get video from a camera, and we also could show the video on a traditional CRT display or a LCD screen. And the used of touch import equipment is favor for us. All of those video capture and display and touch controlling implement on a 2.8 inch board that is what this paper do. At the same time this platform can implement nine digital zooms and modulate video contrast and brightness in CRT display and LCD screen[6~7].

In respect that we use a digital multimedia processor that is TMS320DM642[1~2]. That is an effective image processing fixed-point DSP of TI Company. The preponderance of this DSP is that it has three video ports.

Each port can provide video capture or display, and it is seamless link with video AD[4] and DA[5] converters.

The section 2 shows the implement of this system, and it mainly describes the hardware of proposed platform. And introduce how to get video capture and display and LCD  touch screen[3,8] controlling. The section 3 shows how to implement digital zoom algorithm. And section 4 shows the experiment results. At last the section 5 concludes this paper.



II. THE HARDWARE DESIGN OF PROPOSED SYSTEM  The hardware platform mainly consist a fixed-point DSP- TMS320DM642 and a video ADC-saf7113 and a video DAC-ADV7179. The figure 1 shows the whole hardware design of this platform.

Video capture  A video camera captures an analog video that comes to the video ADC changed to digital signal. Before that the DSP should configure the ADC to PAL formula through IIC bus control. Because the DSP-DM642 has IIC controller, so it is easy to implement. Then the digital video will store in SDRAM through VP0 port of the DSP.

Firstly the DSP configure VP0 port to video capture module. Secondly digital comes to the FIFO of VP0 and then stored in SDRAM[9] through EDMA mode. At last we gain the digital video data.

The size of video data from ADC is 720 by 576 YCbCr4:2:2. Because the size of LCD screen is 320 by 240 pixels, we should cut the video to fit the LCD. So when we show video on CRT display and LCD screen the size of the image is the same large.

B. Video display  Video display includes CRT display and LCD screen. The digital video data store in SDRAM, the DSP could transmit that data to DAC through VP2 by EDMA. Firstly DSP configures the VP2 port to video model. Then DSP configures the DAC to PAL formula through IIC bus controller. Finally we can see video showing on CRT display.

The CRT display model is easy because the video come form VP0 that is PAL formula and display is also PAL formula by VP2. It not needs any transfer except the size of image. But the LCD display is different from CRT. The image formula of camera and CRT is YCbCr4:2:2, but the image formula of LCD is RGB. We need transfer that to fit it.

The equations show as follows: R=Y+1.14V (1) G=Y-0.39U-0.58V  (2) B=Y+2.03U  (3) Due to the DSP is fixed-point; we convert the transfer  equations to the follows. The effect of LCD display is satisfaction.

R=Y+V+V/8 (4)  G=Y-U/4-U/8-V/2-V/16  (5) B=Y+2U  (6) When we get RGB image, the DSP transmit that to LCD  screen by EMIF port. The DSP can process the video signal efficiently. So it can modulate the contrast and brightness CRT display and LCD screen to what we need.

C. Touch screen controlling  The LCD has a touch screen, so we should control it by DSP. And we need a touch controller. In this paper we use the ADS7846 to control the touch screen.

The touch screen is resistance model. When we touch the screen it will generate analog signal to ADS7846, and it can transmit the signal to digital coordinate. The DSP gets the coordinate from VP1 port. Before that the DSP should configure the VP1 port to McBSP model. The DSP send a getting X coordinate order, then the ADS7846 will give out it to DSP. The Y coordinate is the same model.

The table 1 shows almost a vertical line and table 2 shows almost a horizontal line.

And the cross move follow the touch. The purpose of the cross is that we can point out a target what we need. The implement is that the DSP generates a black and white cross stored in SDRAM and then add the cross on the image. When image shows on display we can see the cross and it moving follow our finger touch on the LCD screen.

The figure 2 shows an image added a cross.

III. DIGITAL ZOOM ALGORITHM  We store original video data in SDRAM, and that we can get digital zoom image by DSP. The digital zoom algorithm has several ways. On this platform we can implement two algorithms. According to need it can select one to implement.

One algorithm is nearest interpolation that is simply and fast, but the effect is not so good. And the other is bilinear interpolation that is difficult and slow, but the effect is excellence.

The size of original image is 320 by 240 pixels. We should implement 9 times digital zoom. Then we get 960 by 720 pixels. The CRT display and LCD screen both show 320 by 240 image, so we cut the centre image of 960 by 720 data to get 320 by 240 data.

A Nearest interpolation  This algorithm is a simple digital image zoom method.

The advantage is the speed; it is so fast to get a large digital zoom. Though the effect is not so good, it is all the same used widely.

On this hardware platform the DSP read original image from SDRAM pixel by pixel. And then the DSP copy one pixel to nine pixels. So a 320 by 240 image become to a 960 by 720 image. At last we store this new image to SDRAM.

Due to the image is color. One pixel is constituted by three image data. So we should do three times this step.

When it needs to show on CRT display and LCD screen, the DSP read the new image data and send it to CRT display by VP2 port and to LCD screen by EMIF port.

B Bilinear interpolation  This algorithm puts one original pixel to nine pixels though nearby four original pixel. The transfer equation shows as formula equation (7).

F(i+u,j+v)=(1-u)(1-v)f(i,j)+ (1-u)vf(i,j+1) + u(1-v)f(i+1,j)+ uvf(i+1,j+1) (7)  F(i+u,j+v) is the new pixel and u, v below to 1. The (i,j), (i,j+1), (i+1,j) and (i+1,j+1) are the four nearby pixels.

For implement of this algorithm on DSP, we do some change to adapt the DSP need. The bilinear interpolation is divided to two steps. The first step is horizontal interpolation.

We read image data from the SDRAM horizontal line by line, and then insert one now pixel such as Y? to near two pixels such as X1 and X2. The new pixel vale shows as equation (8). At last we store the new image in SDRAM.

The original image is 320 by 240, and the new image is 960 by 240.

The second step is vertical interpolation .When we end first step, we read this new image vertical line by line. The way is just the same as step one. We insert one now pixel such as Y? to near two pixels such as Y1 and Y2. The new pixel vale shows as equation (9). Then we get the image of 960 by 720.

X?= X1/3 + 2*X2/3 (8) Y?= 2*Y1/3 + Y2/3 (9) Because the image is three colors and the CRT is  YCbCr4:2:2 and LCD screen is RGB, we should do three times of that. At last we cut the center image of 320 by 240 to transmit that image to CRT display and LCD screen.



IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS  Through a video camera we get an original image just like figure3 shows. We store this image in SDRAM and show it on CRT display and LCD screen. Then we get two digital zoom images by nearest interpolation and bilinear     interpolation. The figure 4 shows the nearest interpolation image and the figure 5 shows the bilinear interpolation image    Figure 3 original image    Figure 4 nearest interpolation image    Figure 5 bilinear interpolation image  We can see that the bilinear interpolation image is more trenchancy then the nearest interpolation image. The bilinear interpolation adapt high quality image digital zoom. But the disadvantage is that algorithm is difficult and slow speed. So this system can select one of these two methods by button of LCD touch screen.



V. CONCLUSIONS  In this paper we implement a hardware platform. The hardware platform mainly consist a fixed-point DSP and a video ADC and a video DAC. That system gets digital video from a camera and shows it on CRT display and LCD screen.

And a touch screen has carried out. We can add tracking frame on a target that we interest.

At the same time two digital image zoom algorithm can implement on this platform. At last we give out the result of cross added on image and moving through touch control. We also show the two algorithm of digital zoom, and get the conclusion bilinear interpolation is perfect than nearest interpolation.
