A New Knowledge Acquisition Method in Incomplete Information

Abstract   In this paper, a knowledge acquisition method is proposed in incomplete information system. Firstly, according to the rough set theory some improvement is made to the discernible matrix; then with integration of the self-adaptive genetic algorithm, a new knowledge acquisition algorithm to mine the consistent rules and inconsistent rules from the incomplete information system is presented. Furthermore, according to the study of confidence degree and support degree of association rule in complete information system, the rule confidence degree and support degree is defined within the framework of incomplete information system. Through the examination of experimental results, this algorithm is proved effective, especially to large incomplete information systems.

1. Introduction   Rough set theory [1], introduced by Z.Pawlak in 1982, is an extension of set theory of intelligent system characterized by insufficient, fuzzy, imprecise and uncertain information. Using the concepts of lower and upper approximations in rough set theory, knowledge hidden in information systems may be discovered and expressed in the forms of decision rules. [2]  Two types of decision rules usually may be derived, that is, on one hand, certain rules can be acquired on the basis of the lower approximation of a decision class; on the other hand, based on the upper approximation of a decision class, uncertain or partially certain information is acquired and possible rules may be discovered.

Study of knowledge discovery method from  incomplete information system has become a hotspot, since various studies have been carried out and many knowledge discovery approaches have been proposed in this field, such as Kryszkiewicz [3][4][5] who used the extensions of rough set model to reason in incomplete information system with missing values. Lingras and Yao [6] employed two different generalizations of rough set models to generate plausible rules with incomplete information systems. Hong et al. [7] proposed a new learning algorithm which can simultaneously derive rules from incomplete information systems. Using the concept of maximal consistent block set, Leung and Li [8] formulate an approach to acquire knowledge in incomplete system.

Genetic algorithm, an effective searching and optimizing technique applied widely in scientific study filed, has the good performance of robust and global search. WrOblewski [9] applied the genetic algorithm to find minimal reduction in complete information system and got good results.

In this paper, based on an improved discernible matrix and self-adaptive genetic algorithm, we design and implement a knowledge discovery algorithm in incomplete information system.

2. Preliminaries   To begin with, several necessary concepts of information system are introduced in [3] [10].

Definition 1: Information system An information system is an ordered quadruple <U,  A, V, f >, where U is a non-empty finite set of objects, A=C?D is a non-empty finite set of attributes, C denotes the set of condition attributes and D denotes the set of decision attributes. C?D=?, V is the union of attribute domain, and f: U?A?V is an information    function associating a unique value of each attribute with every object which belongs to U. If a is an attribute in A (a?A), xi an object in U (xi?U), then f (xi, a) denotes the value of object xi of attribute a.

Definition 2: Rule confidence degree and rule support degree  Rule acquired in the information system usually has two kinds, namely, consistent rules and inconsistent rules. Generally, a consistent rule can be denoted by the following format:  <Condition 1| Condition 2 |? ?|Condition n?Conclusion>  Whereas the inconsistent rule is more complicated, with a confidence degree a (0<=a<=1) introduced to denote the rule by the following format:  <Condition 1| Condition 2 |? ?|Condition n Conclusion  a>  In an information system <U, A, V, f >, A=C?D, acquired rules always have forms like Des(Ei, C)?Des(Xj, D), Ei?Xj? ?, and the confidence degree a of rule as well as the support degree u of rule are defined below:  a= |Ei?Xj| /|Ei| u= |Ei?Xj| /|U| Ei ?U/IND(C), Xj ?U/IND(D), Ei  is the condition  equivalence relation class,  Xj is the decision equivalence relation class in information system, and U is the universe( a finite set of objects).

Obviously, the confidence degree of consistent rule is equal to 1; whereas the confidence degree of inconsistent rule is between 0 and 1. The initialization value of a and u is proposed in advance by the user.

Definition 3: Incomplete information system <U, A, V, f > is called an incomplete information  system if  V contains null value for at least one attributes a?A, otherwise it is complete. Further on, we will denote null value by *, that is f(xi, a )=* . [4]  Definition 4: Similar relation Let B?A, then a similar relation is derived from B:  SIM(A)={ (x, y)? U?U ? ?a ?B, f(x, a)=f(y, a) or f(x, a)=* or f(y, a)=* }.

Definition 5: Lower approximation and upper approximation  Let X?U, B?A, BX is lower approximation of X, iff  BX={ x? U ? SIMB(x) ?X}={ x? X ? SIMB(x) ?X}; B _  X is upper approximation of X, iff B _  X={ x? U ? SIMB(x)? X ?? }=?{ SIMB(x) ? x? X }.

3. Rule extraction algorithm  3.1. Improved discernible matrix   In practical application, if interest is only paid to the decision rules acquired from the information system and not more attention is paid to differentiate all similar relation in the decision information system, the decision information system is grouped to some decision equivalence class in terms of difference value of decision attributes,  Obviously, each object in Xj has some differences really, and if only the impact from condition attributes is considered about decision equivalence class, the difference of each object in Xj will be ignored. In this sense, the proposed method is to focus on the core of question and reduce the compute complexity.

The improved discernible matrix is defined as follows:  Definition: An incomplete information system <U, A, V, f > (A=C?D). B?A, Si ,Sj?U/SIM(B), i, j=1,2,?n, n=| U/SIM(B) |;  Xk?U/IND(D),D is the set of decision attributes, k=1,2,?m, m=|U/IND(D) |.

The improved discernible matrix  is a  n X n square matrix  Ms (B)= { Ms (i,j) }n X n ,1? i, j? n,  where the discernible matrix  Ms (i, j) is defined as follows:    Value of Ms (i, j) is NULL which denotes the difference is ignored in the similar relations. Obviously, the improved matrix is a symmetry matrix, because with some NULL value neglected, the compute complexity is greatly reduced.

3.2. Rule Confidence degree and rule support degree in incomplete information system   Based on the definition 3, 4 and 5, acquired rules always have forms like Des(Si, C)?Des(Xj, D), Si?Xj? ?, the confidence degree ? and the support degree u are defined subsequently in an incomplete information system <U, A, V, f > (A=C?D).

ai= |Si?Xj| /|Si| ui= |Si?Xj| /|U| Si ?U/SIM(C),Xj ?U/SIM(D), Si  is the condition  attributes similar relation class and Xj is the decision attributes similar relation class in information system, and U is the universe( a finite set of objects). Based on the study of [3], ? d?D, f(xi, d )?*, comes the SIM(D)= IND(D), Xj ?U/IND(D).

Owing to the complication of incomplete information system and character of similar relation, if two objects which included in the same condition attributes similar relation (Si) have the different decisive attributes, a clash will emerge. According to the definition 2, the acquired rule can be depicted by the form of <Condition 1| Condition 2 |......|Condition  , , ( , )  , ( ) ( ) i k j k  s i i  NULL if i j S X S X M i j  a if a B a S a S ? ? ??  = ? ? ??    n Conclusion1 ? Conclusion2  a>, ar? =max{ ari , arj } and ur?={ uri, urj}. In this way every clash discussed above can be discernible.

3.3. Rule extracting algorithm in incomplete information system   In terms of improved discernible matrix, the rule extraction algorithm in incomplete information system is described as follows:  Input: the initial incomplete information system <U, A, V, f >, (A=C?D), B?A , a0, u0.

Output: rule set R, ? r?R, ra>= a0, ru>= u0.

Step 1: Data pretreatment; Step 2: In terms of condition attributes set C,  B??C,Group the decision information system to some object similar relation classes Si, Si?U/SIM(B?), i=1,2,?,| U/SIM(B?) |;  Step 3: In terms of decision attributes set D , Group the decision information system to some decision object equivalence relation classes Xj, Xj?U/IND(D),j=1,2,?,| U/IND(D) |;  Step 4: Find the minimal attributes reduction with the optimization of self-adaptive genetic algorithm and acquire the decision rules, with the detail introduced in section 4.

Step 4: Based on result of the minimal attributes reduction, induce the decisive rules, that is, when Si?Xj is satisfied, the certain rules are obtained; when Si? Xj and Si?Xj? ? are satisfied, the uncertain rule is obtained, where confidence degree a is  |Si?Xj| /|Si|, and support degree u is |Si?Xj| /|U|.

Step 5: If the acquired rule which confidence degree a? a0 and support degree u?u0 are respectively satisfied, can be credited as an anticipant rule and output to the rule set, otherwise discard it. If acquired two rules with the same condition attributes have the different decisive attributes, how one is selected is decided by the confidence degree and support degree; if two rules are satisfied, it turns out a decision composite rule.

4. Self-adaptive genetic algorithm   Genetic algorithm, an effective searching and optimizing technique applied widely in scientific study filed, has a good performance of robust and global search. When it is applied to optimize the rule extraction algorithm, the main arithmetic operators include selection operator, crossover operator, mutation operator to individuals, and especially, include the fitness function which is used to estimate the individual good or not.

In order to apply self-adaptive genetic algorithm to acquire knowledge from incomplete information system, a binary discernible matrix on the basis of section 3.2 is proposed in terms of the condition attributes.[11]     i?[1,2?.n] is the condition attributes, xk, xn are two objects, * denotes a missing attribute value. If ai(xi)=*, it indicates that the attribute ai of object xk is unknown.

4.1. Depiction of chromosome   Based on the definition of the binary discernible matrix, it is easy to express a chromosome. The length of chromosome is the number of the condition attributes, 1 expresses that the corresponding attributes are useful, and 0 tells us that attributes are redundant.

If an information system has N (N>0) condition attributes then it can be expressed by a N bit binary string.

4.2. Fitness function   Fitness function is a sole measure standard to estimate the individual good or not, which is the key operator. In this paper we adopt the method in [11].

The reduction of incomplete information systems can be implemented based on similarity relation. If the similarity relations of objects before or after reduction are the same, then it is a reduction, so the fitness function may be chosen as follows:  f(v)=? where ? is the number of the same similarity  relation of the attribute subset B with the attributes set C in incomplete information systems. If the similarity relations of objects before or after reduction are same completely, ? is best. So it is reasonable to choose ? as fitness functions.

4.3. Selection operator, crossover operator and mutation operator   Roulette wheel method, adopted in this paper, is a common selection method. There are parameters of individual fitness, selection probability and cumulating probability in the roulette wheel. After going through the cross and mutation at the early stage, the M random ethnic groups will in accordance with the principle of retaining individuals with high adaptability use the Roulette wheel to produce next generation.

How to set crossover rate and mutation rate has profound influence on the performance of algorithm.

On one hand, while the too low crossover rate is not  1 ( ) ( ) ( ,( , )  0 ( ) ( ) ( ) * ( ) * i k i n  i k i n i k i n  if a x a x b i k n  if a x a x or a x or a x ??  = ? = = =?    favorable to the reorganization of genes, the too high one is liable to destroy some good individual; On the other hand, while the too small mutation rate leaves the problem of effective genetic default uneasy to solve, the too high one is prone to lose track of the existent effective genes.

The basic principle of algorithm involved in this paper is, by means of involuntarily adapting crossover rate and mutation rate in accordance with the fitness and characteristics of individuals and communities, not only to consistently retain diversity of communities during the whole course of evolution, but also to attain the aim of improving genetic algorithm, constringent speed as well as its performance.

To quantitatively describe the characteristics of distribution shared by current community, this paper uses the following formula to indicate the performance:  ln  H n  i  n  ij ji  1 1  ,4? ? = +==?  Hi,j denotes the Euclid distance between the chromosome i and chromosome j, n the amount of genes in the community, l the length of chromosome.

??[0, 1], when ?=0, every chromosome in this community is totally the same; when ?=1, the possibility of 0 or 1 in every chromosome occupies 50 percent of possibilities, or in other words, it is a random distribution in terms of 0 and 1.

In this paper, two-point crossover is adopted. The specific formulae of self adapting crossover rate and mutation rate are shown below:  ' 'max  max '1.0  avg avgc  avg  f f f f f fP  f f  ? ? >? ?= ? ? ??    ??  ? ? ?  ?  > ? ?+?  = avg  avg avgm  ff  ff ff ffC  P 2.0  )1( max  max?  Pc denotes the crossover rate, Pm the mutation rate, fmax denotes the maximal fitness and favg the average fitness, f ? a value of fitness of the individual which has the bigger fitness value between the crossover individuals,  f denotes the fitness value of mutation individual, and C , the constant coefficient in the process of algorithm evolution, is always a very small real number.

The crossover probability Pc controls frequency of crossover operation. The bigger value of Pc it is, the better ability to find new searching area the genetic algorithm has, but it is easy to lose the individuals of high performance; and the too small value of Pc will lead to rather slow change of searching area. In order to protect individuals with high performance, the  crossover probability usually should be small.

Mutation operator is the assistant operator of  genetic algorithm. It mainly keeps the diversity of individuals and protects the algorithm from converging too early. Mutation probability Pm should be generally small in order to prevent the loss of elite individual.

In view of the definition of Pc and Pm, when the best solution is approaching, reduce the Pc and Pm; when keep away form the solution space, increase the Pc and Pm, that is, the solution of higher fitness has smaller Pc and Pm, and vice versa.

Protecting the high fitness individual is useful to hold the algorithm convergence to the global best solution. In this paper, by self-adaptively adjusting the value of Pc and Pm not only avoids algorithm converging to the local best solution, but also prevents the destroying of elite genes.

5. Experiments   In order to validate our algorithm proposed in section 3, here we employ an example in [4], which depicts an incomplete information system containing information about cars, to illustrate some concepts and computations involved in our proposed method. Here in this example Price, Mileage, Size and Max-Speed are the condition attributes of the system, where d is the decision attribute. (In the sequel, P, M, S and X will stand for Price, Mileage, Size and Max-Speed, respectively.)  Table 1.  Incomplete car table Car Price Mileage Size Max-Speed d 1 high low full low good 2 low * full low good 3 * * compact low poor 4 high * full high good 5 * * full high excellent 6 low high full * good  In this table, the * denotes unknown attributes values. Based on the algorithm proposed in section 3, the knowledge can be discovered from above incomplete information system. The details can be elaborated as follows:  The initial confidence degree a0 and support degree u0 are set as follows: a0=0.5, u0=0.1; Condition attributes set C = {P, M, S, X} and decision attributes D = {d}.

According to the algorithm step 2, similar relation equivalence classes of condition attributes can be counted out, seen from the results below:  S1={1}? S2={2?6}?S3={3}?S4={4?5}?S5={4? 5?6}?S6={2?5?6}  U/SIM?C?={ { 1 } , { 2 , 6 } , { 3 } , { 4 , 5 } , { 4 , 5 , 6 } , { 2 , 5 , 6 } },    In the meanwhile, according to the step3, decision attributes equivalence class can be counted out below:  X1={1?2?3?4}?X2={3}?X3={5} U/IND?D?={ { 1 , 2 , 4, 6 } , { 3 } , { 5 } } Additionally, according to the step 4 of knowledge  acquisition algorithm using the self-adaptive genetic algorithm discussed in section 4 for above incomplete information system, the best chromosome 0011 is found, that is, the condition attributes Size(S) and Max-Speed(X) are two key attributes in this information system. As a result, the acquired rules from this incomplete information system are as follows:  r1:  (S, full) and (X, low)?(d, good) r2:  (S, full) and (X, low)?(d, good) r3:  (S, compact) ?(d, poor) r4:  (S, full) and (X, high)?(d, good) r5:  (S, full) ?(d, good) r6:  (S, full) ?(d, excellent) Because S1?X1 , S2?X1 ,S3?X2 are satisfied, the r1,  r2, r3  are certain rules respectively; because Si? Xj and Si?Xj? ? (i=4,5,6; j=1,2,3) are satisfied, the uncertain rules are obtained. Since rule r1 and r2 are the same, number of acquired rules is 5.

In terms of definition of rule confidence degree and support degree, ai = |Si?Xj| /|Si|, ui = |Si?Xj| /|U|, i=1,2,3,4,5,6, j=1,2,3, the confidence degree and support degree of each rule can be elaborated as follows: a1 =1, u1 =0.167; a2 =1, u2 =0.33; a3 =1, u3 =0.167; a4 =0.5, u4 =0.167; a5 =0.33, u5 =0.167; a6 =0.67, u6 =0.33. If and only if acquired rule which satisfies the confidence degree a? a0 and support degree u?u0, then the rule can be output. Reference the initial a0=0.5, u0=0.1, and we select r1, r2, r3, r4, r6 as the output.

In addition, if a0=0.3 then r5 and r6 are all selected, because two rules with the same condition attributes have the different decisive attributes, then the composite rule is depicted as follows: (S, full) ?(d, good)? (d, excellent), a =0.67, u =0.33;  The rules obtained from our experiment are the same with those done in [8], which proves that our method is efficient. What?s more, the confidence degree and support degree we have defined to every rule lend credibility and reliability to the acquired knowledge.

6. Conclusion and outlook   In this paper, through the study of the confidence degree and support degree of association rule, the rule confidence degree and support degree in incomplete information system is defined; then a improved  discernible matrix is proposed based on the rough set theory. Additionally, a knowledge acquisition algorithm is designed and implemented with the integration of self-adaptive genetic algorithm. Validity experiment has been done towards the algorithm and the results have proved the availability.

Since incomplete information systems are more complicated than complete information system, further research of knowledge acquisition under different requirements in incomplete information system is needed for future research, and the proposed approach strategy can be extended to more complicated and general information system such as multi-value attributes information system or the incomplete fuzzy information system.
