A Case Study in Seeding Collaboration

Abstract?Collaboration at Intel is currently in a stage of  transformation with increased focus on using social computing  and other technologies to boost collaboration and productivity.

This transformation requires a shift in the services IT provides  and a solid understanding of the expectations that employees  have of both their technology and the larger environment in  which collaboration happens.  At the same time, we have been  given the mandate to Be Bold, and Act Fast, leaving little time for  upfront user research and requiring us as UX professionals to re-  think how we enable project teams to be more effective within  this new reality.  One approach that is being used within IT to  help product design teams move more quickly is experience  themes, which package available user research for easier reuse.

The collaboration portfolio has been an early adopter and used  experience themes for the last year to help define the desired  collaboration experience from upfront strategy and back-end  architecture to the design of individual products.   We will share  learnings on how to best use these concepts and discuss the  benefits of having a re-usable, over-arching experience vision in  guiding product decision-making.

I.  INTRODUCTION  Today?s collaboration experience is often a fragmented one that spans multiple vendors, devices, products, and platforms.

Users must shift between vastly different interfaces with divergent experiences, leaving the user often frustrated and less efficient as a result.   IT shops wanting to give the user a more uniform experience often define interface standards that prescribe color schemes, fonts, layouts, and the like.  While these standards are often successful at taming the visual inconsistencies, they do little to address the functional inconsistencies or to ensure that the many fragments come together in a coherent fashion in support of collaboration.

After years of trying to wrestle the individual components of the enterprise experience into some semblance of a usable experience, Intel IT took on an audacious goal to define a One  IT experience that met both employee and customer needs.

Defining an over-arching enterprise user experience (UX) started with having trusted data that can help set the direction.

While we well understood the value of traditional UX methods [1] [2] [3] [4], we found over time that insights derived from these methods, which are often elicited using small sample sizes that are not statistically significant for an enterprise, were often not trusted by traditional IT.  To increase trust and the likelihood of the larger IT organization acting on the resulting insights, we decided to take a hybrid approach that would weave together the outputs of traditional UX methods with analysis of the operational ?big data? that enterprises collect about their users [5] [6] [7].  Along with establishing a trusted data source for optimizing the UX of IT systems, we also generated a treasure trove of data about user behavior and a frame of reference for testing the generalizability of UX insights.

What started out as cross-company research to develop a holistic understanding of what the company?s more than 100K employees want and need evolved into a common language and framework that defines the One IT experience vision that spans the many products and services provided by corporate IT.  [8] The framework is designed to help IT product teams more easily re-use insights from user research and document user needs from high-level themes.  They can then define roadmaps, usage models, and user requirements that will be mapped to design prototypes, underlying capabilities and technologies.

In this paper, we focus on the framework and research results that inform design and implementation of enterprise collaboration solutions. Section II discusses the experience research framework, approach, demographics, and the data set characteristics.  It also explains how the data was connected to individual users to identify user patterns and subsequent derivation of core experience themes, user segments, environmental influencers, and work activities.  It goes on to describe three experience themes, and then focusses on the qualities and elements for the Connect Me theme which is all about Collaboration.  Section III explains how the results derived in Section II are being used within the enterprise by the     IT collaboration portfolio team who was an early adopter of the Connect Me experience theme and the underlying data.  It includes a case study of how the experience themes were used for purposes ranging from setting portfolio strategy to helping an agile product team move faster on a proof-of-concept implementation. Section IV includes challenges, V discusses results and VI concludes with lessons learned from a year of applying using experience themes and their interplay with presumptive design. Reader Note: in this paper, social computing spans a range of collaborative technologies including social analytics, immersive video and sketching, recommendation engines, social networking, content collaboration via multi-media, blogs, wiki, and discussion forums, and cross system activity stream aggregation as used in an enterprise setting.



II. A BIG DATA EXPERIENCE FRAMEWORK  IT, in partnership with HR, conducted more than 200 interviews and 300 participatory design sessions with employees to better understand their needs of the Intel experience.  Additionally, over 12 million employee transactions with Intel systems were captured.  Since the initial study in 2011, IT has added to the data set with more than 10,000 employee surveys and many millions of additional employee transactions, resulting in a 275% growth in the data set in less than two years.  The resulting multi gigabyte data set covers more than 88,000 employees across Intel and around the world.

The transactional ?big data? provided details about employee behavior, but it did not help us understand what motivated employees? behavior or their larger context.  While UX methods yielded rich contextual insights, they relied on small numbers of users and sample sizes that were not always statistically significant at the enterprise level, which put their generalizability into question.  However, by connecting our diverse data sets, we could mitigate these inherent risks of both types; it also let us study the actual behavior of users along with their attitudes towards their IT experience, while at the same time growing our understanding of the holistic IT consumption by individual employees.

We put users at the center of our strategy for connecting our large-scale data set.  Each piece of data was linked to a specific user, and all data for an individual user was linked together.  As our foremost concern was protecting the privacy of employees, prior to making any attempt to integrate the data sets, the raw data was anonymized by replacing all employee identifiers with an encrypted identifier.  By organizing the data in terms of individuals, we could more easily discern user patterns and connect new data as it is discovered.

Best fit patterns were then identified based on similarities in how employees used and responded to IT solutions.  Over a period of months, the final ?meta? patterns emerged and became the foundation of the experience framework.

? Themes, or the core experiences, that enterprise users wanted from the IT experience regardless of what product or service the user was interacting with  ? Segments, or groups of users, with similar usage of enterprise systems, attitudes towards IT, and user needs  ? Influencers, or core elements of the enterprise environment, whose characteristics impact the user?s ability to accomplish work  (e.g., culture)  ? Activities, or the high-level tasks, that all enterprise users engage in in order to accomplish work (e.g., find information)  Together, they define the over-arching IT experience desired by employees.  To aid decision-making, each component had experience objectives defined in terms of user minimum, target, and outstanding expectations of that specific component.    To use, teams must first look for intersections between their product and the larger desired IT experience.  [8]  The framework represented the first-ever broad understanding of the IT experience that is re-usable and extensible to a range of IT products and services.   It provided a shared vocabulary and reference for discussing the enterprise experience that can be applied across individual enterprise products as well as the cumulative IT experience. By providing a common language for discussing the IT experience, it facilitated cross-product conversations, helped democratize participation in UX, and encouraged shared ownership of improving the larger IT experience.

A. Seeding Action with Stories  While the underlying data patterns were potentially powerful, they did not lend themselves to easy re-use in different contexts.  We needed teams to be able to zoom in and understand at a detailed level how the framework could help them reframe the experience of a specific product or service.

At the same time, we needed teams to be able to zoom out and assess how well their product fit the larger experience. The supporting collateral for the framework needed to put a face to the underlying big data and provide IT with an actionable experience vision to drive product design.

Key to the successful use of the experience framework has been the introduction of large-scale, layered storytelling as an underlying unifier across the supporting collateral.  By necessity, the underlying stories focus on particular elements of the dataset and ignore the rest.  Strung together they map the larger IT experience, but individually only tell a piece.  The data set is simply too large and diverse to be told by a single story.  The stories associated with different pieces provide different insights and follow different models.

Users of the framework then take these stories and underlying data to create their own stories that are relevant to what they are trying to accomplish; many stories are possible from the same data. Much has been learned in the last year about how to most effectively use this information with product teams and the collateral has iteratively evolved to better support the layered storytelling necessary to make sense of this mountain of data.  For the framework?s potential to be realized, we needed to socialize it through presentations, social media, workshops and training with everyone from portfolio owners, technical strategists, UX apprentices and practitioners, architects and IT staff. Socialization has been an iterative     process requiring persistence and refinement of our messaging and collateral for different roles within the organization.

B. Seeding Shared Understanding  Experience themes helped the collaboration portfolio team understand the shared expectations that employees have of both the collaboration environment as well as their interactions with social computing tools.  There are three key experience themes that employees expect all social computing solutions to satisfy  ? Feed Me - I quickly and easily find the information I need to speed my work and my life.

? Connect Me - Connect me with the people, resources, and expertise I need to be successful at Intel.

? Know Me - My information is known and protected by Intel; my information is used to improve provided services.

Of the three, Connect Me has the strongest affinity to the overall collaboration portfolio.

To increase the ease of applying an experience theme to a specific product or service, the themes are further broken into qualities that define the essential experience principles needed to bring a specific theme to life. Each quality includes key usage elements and desired functionality.  They were packaged as quality ?trading cards? to provide tangible artifacts for teams to use while defining UX strategy and solution roadmaps.

In order to provide sufficient detail to fuel product teams, experience qualities were decomposed into elements.  Elements specify the key usages that make up a quality, including user scenarios, user requirements, relative importance, illustrative examples, and any user differences.  They were packaged in theme vision books and as 8x10 cards to facilitate use in face- to-face design sessions.

Together, the three themes, 12 qualities, 59 elements, and many hundreds of user requirements detail the envisioned experience.  By mapping the intersection between experience qualities and elements against portfolio and product roadmaps, teams can identify potential gaps between the planned and desired experience for the products in their portfolio.  Table I maps employee expectations related to collaboration from the Connect Me theme.

C. Seeding Shared User Models  Segments provide a common cast of characters for IT teams creating enterprise experiences.  Segments are groups of users, with similar usage of enterprise systems, attitudes towards IT, and user needs.  Of all the framework building blocks, the adoption curve for segments was the shortest, with teams readily seeing the value of knowing the pain points and IT usage patterns of their target audiences.

Each segment has a persona family that represents it; personas put a ?face? to the enterprise user segments. They provide summary information on user characteristics, goals and needs, key tasks and behaviors, pain points, use of IT products, and relative priority of different experience qualities. The collateral ranges from persona family posters, contextual  scenarios, individual personas, day-in-the-life?s, and trading cards.

Although IT experience themes are based on research with thousands of employees and apply to all IT products, how they apply to individual employee segments may vary depending on activity, e.g., collaboration.  Table II summarizes the high-level collaboration patterns or shared focus within the segments.

Seeding a Future Vision of Collaboration  The experience framework is a representation of the desired future of the enterprise from the user perspective.  It provides a thinking model for those who make the day-to-day decisions that define the enterprise.  It encourages them to look beyond their immediate challenges, past the boundaries of what they are responsible for, and consider the holistic experience from the perspective of enterprise users.  This big data look at the employee experience has provided significant insights as to what employees want and need from Intel IT related to collaboration. Key opportunities for improving collaboration that emerged included  ? Make use of collaboration tools easier through seamless integration of tools, a single center of gravity for accessing and managing collaborations, consumer grade experiences, and increased support for sense- making across multiple activity streams.

? Make finding experts or expertise easier through personalized recommendations, more transparent security, and making connections more visible.

? Increased personal interactions with more opportunities to collaborate in person, higher fidelity virtual alternatives, and increased access to video.

? Create a more supportive culture for collaboration through more leadership support and role modeling of best approaches including discipline collaboration [9].



III. TURNING UNDERSTANDING INTO TRANSFORMATION  The framework was intended to seed the envisioned experience into existing processes by providing a shared vocabulary and shared ways of examining the enterprise.  We encouraged teams to selectively apply different pieces of the framework depending on where they were in their existing processes. To help guide enterprise professionals in incorporating the framework into their processes, we proposed the following iterative approach, with the outputs of the last step feeding back into the first.

? Evaluate what is.  Use segments to better understand users and themes (and associated components) to determine how well current reality is meeting user needs.

? Ask what if.  Use relevant theme components to start the conversation with users, stakeholders and teams and to envision possible new futures.

? Prioritize what is most needed.  Use the experience objectives and the outputs of previous steps to set UX strategy, define roadmaps, and identify gaps.

? Define the detail.  Use framework personas, requirements, scenarios, and related design patterns to define what a product or service would do.

We stressed that framework insights were not a replacement for what was already known but instead were additive.  We set the  expectation that the framework would not answer all their questions, and any gaps in understanding would need to be filled using traditional UX methods[1] [2] [3] [4].

A. Seeding Agility with Presumptive Design  The IT collaboration portfolio team further evolved this approach by combining this experience framework with elements of presumptive design [4].  The experience themes, along with what was already known about a particular audience (e.g., field sales), formulated the starting ?presumptions? on which designs were based.  These starting presumptions were then validated using low cost methods and prototypes.   The exact validation approach varied depending on the level of the collaboration facet under scrutiny (e.g., portfolio strategy, product experience), but regardless of approach there was a shared focus on quick, low-cost ways to expose presumptions to potential users and have them respond.

B. Validating Strategic Direction  The IT collaboration portfolio team led a recent corporate strategic discussion (CSD) with executive management.  The discussion content pulled heavily from the information that formed the original basis for the IT Experience Themes.

However, the original data was almost nine months old so many of the most recent hires into Intel were not represented by the information.  Additionally, our CEO saw attracting and retaining new employees as an essential component of Intel?s growing business in new markets.

The CSD team turned to crowdsourcing for a quick way to validate our starting assumptions about collaboration and capture the collective wisdom of Intel?s newest employees on this topic. Crowdsourcing is the practice of soliciting feedback on a subject from a large group of people through an online community. The general concept is to combine the efforts of many participants, where each one contributes a small portion, which then creates a relatively large or significant result.  It is definitely a guerilla method of employee research (meaning it is quick and dirty but still gathers lots of useful data).  It is also fast for employees and takes only a matter of minutes versus an hour or so for more traditional user research methods.

A 10-day bounded crowdsourcing was used to gather ideas on how Intel can better leverage the combined intelligence of employees to improve collaboration and increase velocity at Intel.  We asked questions in four categories that we presumed to be the primary problem areas related to collaboration:  ? Velocity of innovation  ? Barriers to working together  ? External best practices we should integrate within Intel  ? Finding the right people to collaborate with  44 percent of the threads related to organizational barriers, 45 percent to technology, 7 percent to people, and 4 percent to the physical workspace.  The crowdsourcing results aligned with other research we?d conducted, which found that 73 percent of employees talked about how collaboration helps them feel engaged at work [10, 11].

C. Identifying Goals and Priorities the Portfolio  The experience themes and their underlying components were diagrammed into a wall sized mind map format.

Meanwhile the portfolio UX teams had compiled deep dive research in the context of specific business groups and projects.

Using sticky notes and highlighters, we added in data that we found from the deep dive research where it intersected with the experience themes and components.  We also found a few small nuances that we added to the mind map and noted the sources so we could go back to them.  Next, we reviewed the mind map and looked for nuances related to particular audiences or segments.  Figure 1 shows a portion of the combined picture that highlights what was in common along with gaps that we needed to resolve for Connect Me theme, Presence quality and the ?See who I am working? with element which mapped to pervasive video capabilities.

Next, we used the mind map and the underlying user needs defined by experience qualities and elements to get the portfolio design process started.  To help define the portfolio?s collaboration gaps and priorities, we isolated the elements relevant to collaboration and developed a heat map. Key questions included: How well are today?s capabilities meeting target requirements for each collaboration element? How important are each of those elements to our users? Answers to those two questions would help us prioritize where to focus development energy first.  We relied heavily on the minimum, target, and outstanding requirements that were defined for each quality and element from the themes.  This importance rating of requirements was based on the relative frequency of requirements across the underlying research and the importance that employees placed on the requirement.

For each experience element related to collaboration, we looked across the portfolio and identified which capabilities and services currently addressed the requirements and, at the      same time, identified where the gaps were.  For example, an element critical to initiating collaboration is ?Bump into Interesting,? which is about helping users serendipitously bump into information or people that are interesting and useful to them. We looked across the portfolio and identified which capabilities and services currently addressed the requirements for ?Bump into Interesting.? In this case, we found that the portfolio didn?t have any solutions that were meeting the target requirements?that is, presenting people and resources to the user based on the user?s current connections, the communities that they follow, and their online activity.   Figure 2 shows an excerpt from the heat map for that element with details for minimum and target roadmap levels.

Figure 2. ?Bump into Interesting? Heat Map Detail  D. Speeding Agile Product Design  On agile projects, where time is typically the scarcest commodity, the rich detail provided by the framework helps bring focus to team efforts and helps teams more rapidly move  Figure 1. An Excerpt from the Composite Collaboration Mind Map     from concept discussions to prototypes.  Framework segments and an underlying component of experience qualities, namely experience elements, were combined with what was already known about a particular space to formulate the starting ?presumptions? on which designs were based.

Teams found that experience elements were the richest source of starting presumptions.  They document key usage scenarios, requirements users expect in products with a particular quality, provide example designs, and provide rich detail for project teams. In multiple projects, this information has seeded agile Vision Quest activities and served as a catalyst for creating design hypotheses around core presumptions of what features and capabilities should be included in the solution.

From the created design hypotheses, a series of contextual scenarios were written that re-framed element usage scenarios in light of the current project and then were used to storyboard the product vision.  From the design hypothesis that the team formed, a series of contextual scenarios were written. The scenarios were collectively organized to form a high-level ?narrative? to tell a persuasive story of the product vision and documented in a storyboard artifact.  Figure 3 shows a narrative excerpt from the resulting storyboard.

Figure 3. Product Storyboard Narrative Excerpt  Framework examples often inspire many of the designs reflected in the proof-of-concept (POC) prototypes (see Figure 4), and the storyboard typically contains a swim lane that the team used to map the experience themes to the relevant portion of the story. To validate design presumptions with users, several intervals of presumptive design tests were conducted with end-users in tandem with design activities. Those features that were not validated as ?valuable? by users were removed from the storyboard and product vision. Following this process, the vision iteratively became more defined and evolved into a ?lightweight? clickable prototype which was then used to engage stakeholders, impacted teams, analysts, solution architects and the technical team in more conversations about feasibility and product requirements.

Figure 4. ?Low Fidelity Prototype Based on an Experience Element  E. Evaluating Experiences  Along with using the framework to set strategy and define project goals, IT teams are also evaluating how well existing or proposed experiences satisfy the cumulative IT experience envisioned by our users.  Evaluation is made easy with a spreadsheet that lets teams check off the high-level requirements satisfied by the experience, and then quickly see how well it aligns with the over-arching experience framework.

The end-result is a color-coded heat map which allows teams to visualize where they should focus more attention in order to improve user experience.   Red areas in the heat map signify gaps that are important to resolve for users, green areas represent healthy areas and yellow show medium level concern. The evaluation facilitates discussion between business owners, developers and UX professionals to determine what capabilities the business thinks they need and creates a space for possibility thinking with developers.



IV. CHALLENGES  The IT Experience Framework puts a face to the underlying big data and provides an approach to defining a unified IT experience, but these insights are merely the tip of the iceberg of potential ones that could be derived from the underlying data set.  They are like any model, a simplification, but even so and with supporting collateral, project teams can still find them unwieldy to work with unless they have had coaching prior to interacting with them.

There are multiple challenges with undertaking an effort of this size.  Designing great collaboration solutions is as much about getting and analyzing data as it is about transforming an organization to actually use it effectively. It?s a journey and a process ? not a silver bullet. It requires joint partnership and extensive collaboration across multiple disciplines. Despite best efforts, the challenges of use are only expected to grow.  In the two years since the introduction of experience themes, the underlying data set has grown 275% and the supporting story- telling collateral has grown by 870% to better support the range of usage seen across IT project teams.  That?s a lot of information for anyone to digest.  Some of the key challenges associated with this process are discussed below.

A. Trapped in Flat Space  To date, the majority of experience theme collateral resides in flat files or posts in social media forums.  The underlying hierarchical structure of the deep storytelling defined by the collateral can be obscured by the media in which they reside.

While physical artifacts are often needed for kickoff or face-to- face sessions, online access and an effective search is also needed.  We have experimented with using a wiki as a knowledge delivery system for the framework, but by definition it is a site where people go to collaborate on content, which typically contains few graphics. The framework is a definitive document, and while we encourage linking of additional information; the framework content must remain unchanged.   Additionally, the framework is highly visual with data graphics, personas and design examples, which do not lend themselves to the content heavy wiki format, nor is there a simple mechanism for turning existing, highly readable content into wiki pages, so it increases our workload.

B. Enabling Social Storytelling  Today, storytelling with the underlying big data is primarily limited to the research team that produced the experience themes or the UX professionals who work directly with them.

The rich data available on individuals, specific job roles, different organizations, and even geographic areas makes possible a great many more stories than what is currently embedded in the experience themes.  However, the lack of ?self-service? environments to enable utilization of the data limits utilization of the data within larger IT.

Additionally, IT teams often need to understand how the overarching information about the employee experience intersects with data specific to an IT product or service in order to discover new insights about employee expectations of their product and how their product needs to align with the over- arching IT experience.  Today, this is also a manual process that can require substantive manipulation to ensure the limitations of today?s analysis tools are not exceeded.

C. Fostering Knowledge Sharing  Project teams are not just re-using existing knowledge, they are adding to it by creating detailed stories of use in specific contexts and potentially doing additional research that may lend themselves to re-use by other IT teams focused on the same audience.  While the experience framework provides a skeleton for sharing information, this structure has not yet been brought to life online and no easy methods exist for teams wanting to share their stories and associated designs.  Until that happens, widespread sharing (and associated efficiencies) is unlikely to occur.

Knowledge sharing is further inhibited by the siloed nature of most IT shops.  Each dataset incorporated in the framework requires individual negotiation, and data from different areas is often incompatible, incomprehensible, and messy to tie together.  Additionally, users of the framework seldom share the experience artifacts built on top of the framework whether personas, scenarios, or design patterns.  Success requires shifting the mindset of UX professionals to look past individual methods and products and look holistically at the enterprise  experience, to be comfortable with leveraging re-usable insights about their users, and to accept that these insights can be successfully packaged for re-use by traditional IT professionals.

D. Exponentially Increasing Big Data  Lastly, although collateral growth is beginning to stabilize based on active use by IT project teams, the underlying data set is expected to grow even more rapidly in coming years as analysis tools become capable of handling even larger data sets.

Only about 30% of available user transactional data has been incorporated in the current framework and the amount of data continues to increase on a daily basis further exacerbating the challenges of re-use and sense-making by IT project teams at large.

E. Experience-Driven Change is a Journey  Even with an over-arching experience framework and strong leadership commitment to change collaboration at Intel, experience-driven transformation is a journey and what works for one team or individual may not work for another.  It takes time and resources. It takes a willingness to collaborate with the rest of the organization to find approaches that work.  It requires recognizing that every team or individual is starting from a different point of faith and understanding of what UX is and how to do it. To do this, we have all had to transform our thinking, our approach, our decisions, and actions ? from how we do user research to defining portfolio strategy to individual decisions made on enterprise projects all the way up to architectural decisions and overall strategy decisions for the IT organization.



V. DISCUSSION AND RESULTS  The experience framework is an innovative way to represent UX research in a way that is consumable within the enterprise. The framework is being used across various levels of the collaboration portfolio. It is feeding collaboration portfolio strategy, technical architecture plans, and the design of specific products.  As a result, new learnings have emerged about how to most effectively integrate into the portfolio strategy and design, which in turn has resulted in the development of new supporting collateral.  Key lessons learned include  ? When first introducing a team to the underlying concepts, having them use the qualities to evaluate their own product or service is key to learning and provides a baseline for future improvements.

? For setting product vision and strategy, experience qualities are paramount. They spark conversation and provide easy user functionality checklists that can be incorporated into user experience roadmaps.

? Product teams, once they get past the original strategizing and into design, need the more detailed experience element cards that provide one place to access user requirements, scenarios, and key audience differences.

? Having sample designs that satisfy the themes is important; they serve as a baseline for conversations about how the pattern can be improved or spark a new idea.

? Different people have different learning styles and different teams have different ways to work together.

If collateral doesn?t resonate, iterate, iterate, iterate.

We also have found that in the early stages of an effort, a hard copy of collateral is often key to their successful use during project kickoffs.  Generating design ideas is often fastest when you have hardcopy of element cards and other experience theme collateral so the team can ?re-use? collateral elements in paper prototypes.

We have seen the value-add of the principles of presumptive design and the agile process to experience themes.

At their most basic, they provide a foundational understanding of the needs of different kinds of employees in spaces that lack the time or resources to invest in more traditional user research.

The themes also mitigate some of the key risks associated with presumptive design [3] by providing a larger holistic look at the experience space and overarching prioritization that helps prevent teams from focusing on the wrong solution to design or ignoring the needs of the larger experience into which a design must fit.

However, use of experience themes does come at a cost.

Newcomers to experience themes can easily lose their way in the multi-layered story.  Coaching or training on experience themes is needed before teams dive into their use.  Some understanding of how the pieces fit together helps teams more quickly and effectively integrate themes into their existing process.  Often times the first exposure may feel overwhelming and only in follow-up discussions do the pieces click.  But when they do click, they substantially speed teams from strategy definition to design.

Furthermore, experience themes provide IT with common target experiences and shared understanding of target users that can be leveraged across IT services and portfolios, not just collaboration.  This shared vision has the potential to transform IT product and services resulting in a more cohesive and usable 1 IT experience that could increase the velocity of teams across Intel.



VI. CONCLUSIONS  By far, the biggest potential value offered by IT Experience Themes is increased velocity. Imagine the time gained by having productive team discussions that generate strategy and design ideas faster because the team is referencing a common framework and language that can be understood by all. This recent work with experience themes can lead the way for other teams both in IT and in broader Intel to more effectively use experience themes to drive service strategy and design.

However, the framework results in significant change in the over-arching IT experience only when the finds are communicated in a way that resonates with the broad base of people who work together to define and develop the enterprise  experience.  An architect will look at the framework collateral through a different lens than a systems analyst or service owner.  Further, the framework seeds change only through a participatory process?it is not something that can be done by merely throwing the framework over the fence at those outside of UX.  For change to happen, all levels of the organization must participate in the conversation and take ownership of how their own role impacts the enterprise experience.

The large-scale, layered storytelling approach allows experience theme users to explore the underlying data below the surface level of themes to find their own meaning and seeds design investigations of features and possible interaction models. This approach to socializing and utilizing experience themes provides a practical model for the creators of other types of experience themes to more quickly trigger transformation in their own spaces.
