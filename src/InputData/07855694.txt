Abstract?Social sensing is a new big data application paradigm for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), where a group of individuals volunteer (or are recruited) to report measurements or observations about the physical world at scale. A fundamental challenge in social sensing applications lies in discovering the correctness of reported observations and reliability of data sources without prior knowledge on either of them.

We refer to this problem as truth discovery. While prior studies have made progress on addressing this challenge, two important limitations exist: (i) current solutions did not fully explore the uncertainty aspect of human reported data, which leads to sub-optimal truth discovery results; (ii) current truth discovery solutions are mostly designed as sequential algorithms that do not scale well to large-scale social sensing events. In this paper, we develop a Scalable Uncertainty-Aware Truth Discovery (SUTD) scheme to address the above limitations. The SUTD scheme solves a constraint estimation problem to jointly estimate the correctness of reported data and the reliability of data sources while explicitly considering the uncertainty on the reported data. To address the scalability challenge, the SUTD is designed to run a Graphic Pro- cessing Unit (GPU) with thousands of cores, which is shown to run two to three orders of magnitude faster than the sequential truth discovery solutions. In evaluation, we compare our SUTD scheme to the state-of- the-art solutions using three real world datasets collected from Twitter: Paris Attack, Oregon Shooting, and Baltimore Riots, all in 2015. The evaluation results show that our new scheme significantly outperforms the baselines in terms of both truth discovery accuracy and execution time.

Social sensing has become a new big data appli- cation paradigm for CPS, where a group of individuals volunteer (or are recruited) to report measurements or observations about the physical world at scale [56].

Examples of social sensing applications include traffic monitoring and congestion control applications using  data from drivers? or passengers? smartphones, geo- tagging and smart city applications using crowdsens- ing data from common citizens, and real-time situation awareness applications that report disaster fallout using online social media. Due to the open data contribu- tion opportunities and unvetted nature of data sources (e.g., human sensors), a fundamental challenge in social sensing applications lies in discovering the correctness of reported observations and reliability of data sources without prior knowledge on either of them, which is referred to as truth discovery problem in social sensing. This work contributes to addressing the veracity aspect of the big data challenge in CPS applications.

Consider a disaster scenario like Ecuador Earthquake (April 2016), where many damages happened in the city and people volunteered to report real-time information about different aspects of the earthquake through online social media (e.g., Twitter). Such information can be effectively used to obtain accurate and timely situation awareness of the disaster and support decision makings on rescuing efforts and resource dispatch. However, it is challenging to accurately ascertain the correctness of human sensed data with little or no prior knowledge of the human sensors and the claims they contribute [68].

For example, users may report unreliable information on Twitter that could mislead people to the locations that do not have the desirable resources (e.g., food, water, gas) [64]. Furthermore, unlike physical sensors, humans are more likely to generate the claims with different degrees of uncertainty (e.g., affirmative assertions versus pure guesses), which add further complexity to the truth discovery problem [27].

Prior studies in sensor networks [33], [59], [63], [64], data mining [15], [68], and machine learning communi- ties [23], [37] have made a significant progress to address the truth discovery problem in social sensing. Despite such progress, two important limitations exist. First, cur- rent solutions did not fully explore the uncertainty aspect     Events Tweet Uncertainty Degree Oregon Shooting ?There?s a shooter!

High Uncertainty  Table 1: Claims of Different Degrees of Uncertainty in Real World Events  of the claims generated by human sensors and assumed all claims are affirmative. However, such assumption does not hold in real world social sensing applications.

For example, during Oregon Shooting and Baltimore Riots events in 2015, people reported on Twitter their claims that are of different degrees of uncertainty in relation to the events (see Table 1). Simply ignoring such difference in uncertainty of claims are shown to lead to suboptimal truth discovery results [59], [63]. Second, current truth discovery solutions are mostly designed as sequential algorithms that cannot easily run on parallel computing platforms (e.g., cloud, GPU). Such scalability deficiency greatly limits the application of current truth discovery solutions in large-scale social sensing events.

A few technical challenges exist in order to address the above limitations of the truth discovery solutions.

First, it is challenging to model and quantify the degrees of uncertainty human sensors express in their claims and incorporate such uncertainty feature into a rigorous truth discovery solution. Second, it is not a simple task to accurately assess the quality of the truth discovery results without knowing the ground truth information on either source reliability or claim correctness. Third, it is nontrivial to design a parallel truth discovery solution that can run much faster than its sequential counterpart without sacrificing the truth discovery accuracy.

To address the above challenges, this paper develops a Scalable Uncertainty-Aware Truth Discovery (SUTD) scheme (Figure 1). The SUTD scheme solves a constraint estimation problem to jointly estimate the correctness of reported data and the reliability of data sources while explicitly exploring the uncertainty feature of claims.

Rigorous confidence bounds have been derived to assess the quality of the truth discovery results output by SUTD scheme using the well-grounded results from estimation theory. We also designed a parallel paradigm of SUTD that runs a Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) with 2496 cores, which is shown to run two to three orders of magnitude faster than the sequential truth discovery solutions without degrading the performance in the es- timation accuracy. In evaluation, we compare our SUTD scheme with state-of-the-art discovery solutions using three Twitter datasets collected during recent events: Paris Attack event, Oregon Shooting event and Baltimore Riots, all in 2015. The evaluation results demonstrate that our new scheme significantly improves both truth discovery accuracy and execution time compared to  the baselines. In this paper, we primarily focus on the disaster and emergency response scenarios since the amount of factual and verifiable information is more significant compared to other social events (e.g., presidential election, protests). However, the authors discuss the limitation and possible generalization of our proposed model to better handle social events in Section 7. The results of this paper are important because they address two fundamental challenges in social sensing (i.e., uncertainty of claims and scalability of the solution), which provide a solid basis for future truth discovery solutions using principled approaches.

First, we extended our previous proposed model in [60] by developing new confidence bounds to rigorously assess the quality of the truth discovery results (Section 4).

Fourth, we performed a set of experiments on three new datasets collected from recent events (i.e., Paris attack, Oregon shooting and Baltimore riots in 2015) and further evaluated the robustness and efficiency of our scheme in these real world scenarios (Section 6). Finally, we extended our related work with specific discussion on Cyber- Physical Systems and discussed the fitness of our work into the scope of the special issue (Section 2).

2 RELATED WORK  Reliability is one of the fundamental challenges in Cyber- Physical Systems (CPS). Prior works in CPS have made significant advances to address the reliability challenge in time and functional dimensions [4], [11], [12], [25], [26], [30], [34], [36], [46], [51], [53]. For the time reliability, there exist a rich amount of literature on designing var- ious scheduling policies and utilization bounds in real time community [48]. For example, Liu et al. developed a set of basic utilization bounds for periodic tasks [26].

Many follow-up works extend the basic bounds by considering run-time [36], fault-tolerance [34], and multi- frame periodic models [30]. Utilization bounds have also been derived for aperiodic tasks [25], [51], [53]. For the functional reliability, it mainly focuses on correctness of program logic and system modeling [42], [49]. For example, Cook et al. developed useful tools for program analysis and software verification in cyber-physical and hybrid systems [11], [12]. Alur et al. and Saeeloei et al. developed formalism based methods to study the correctness of models in CPS [4], [46]. In contrast, this paper studies the data reliability challenge, which is mo- tivated by the CPS applications with human-in-the-loop, especially the applications that use human as sensors.

Social sensing is becoming a new application paradigm in CPS and smart cities [1], [2]. The ideas of getting people involved into the loop of the sens- ing process (e.g., participatory [7], opportunistic [24] and human-centric [17] sensing) have been extensively  studied in projects such as MetroSense [8], Urban Sens- ing [13] and SurroundSense [5]. The idea of using hu- mans as sensors themselves came more recently [52].

For example, human sensors can contribute their ob- servations through ?sensing campaigns? [31], [43], [44] or social data scavenging [47], [69]. A survey of social sensing [2] covers many challenges of using humans as sensors such as privacy perseverance [3], [6], incentives design [20], [22], and social interaction promotions [40], [41]. However, truth discovery remains to be a critical research question in social sensing. In this paper, we developed a new SUTD scheme to solve the uncertainty- aware truth discovery problem.

Fact-finders are a set of techniques developed in data mining and machine learning community to assess the quality of aggregated information from unreliable data sources. Hubs and Authorities [23] is one of the early fact-finders that computes the source and claim credibil- ity in an iterative fashion. Other fact-finding schemes enhanced these basic frameworks by using more re- fined heuristics [68], incorporating analysis on properties of claims [37] and dependency between sources [15].

More recent fact-finding algorithms address additional complexities such as prior knowledge on sources and claims [38], quantification of the accuracy of source and data credibility [61] and the semantic features of claims [28], [29]. In this paper, we will use insights from fact-finders and develop a new truth discovery solution that addresses uncertainty and scalability challenges in social sensing applications.

Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) approach is commonly used in cyber-physical systems and sen- sor networks for various estimation and data fusion tasks [50], [67]. For example, A MLE based location estimation scheme has been developed to locate mul- tiple sources based on acoustic signal measurements from individual sensors [50]. Xiao et al. presented a distributed consensus based MLE approach to compute the unknown parameters of sensory measurements cor- rupted by Gaussian noise [67]. The MLE framework has also been applied to address clock synchronization [66], target tracking [65], and compressive sensing [10] in WSN. However, the estimation variables in the above works are mainly continuous variables that represent measurements of physical sensors. In this paper, we focus on a set of discrete variables that represent ei- ther true or false statements about the physical world from human sensed observations. The MLE problem we solved is actually harder due to the discrete nature of the estimated variables and the inherent complexity of modeling humans as sensors in social sensing.

Finally, our work is also related with a type of in- formation filtering system called recommendation sys- tems [21]. Expectation Maximization (EM) has been used as an optimization approach for both collaborative filtering [55] and content based recommendation sys- tems [39]. For example, Wang et al. developed a collab- orative filtering based system using the EM approach to    2332-7790 (c) 2016 IEEE.

Pomerantz et al. proposed a content-based system using EM to explore the contextual information to recommend movies [39]. However, the truth discovery in social sensing studies a different problem. Our goal is to estimate the correctness of observations from a large crowd of unvetted sources with unknown reliability and various degrees of uncertainty rather than predict users? ratings or preferences of an item. Moreover, recommen- dation systems commonly assume a reasonable amount of good data is available to train their models while little is known about the data quality and the source reliability a priori in social sensing applications.

3 PROBLEM STATEMENT AND DISTINCTION 3.1 Problem Statement In this section, we formulate the uncertainty-aware truth discovery problem in social sensing as a constraint es- timation problem. In particular, we consider a group of M sources, namely, S1, S2,...,SM , who collectively report a set of N observations about the physical world, namely, C1, C2,..,CN . Since we normally do not know the correctness of such observations a priori, we refer to them as claims. In this paper, we focus on binary claims. This is motivated by the observation that the states of the physical environment in many social sensing applications can be abstracted by a set of true or false statements. For example, in a geotagging application to find potholes on city streets, each possible location is associated with one claim that is true if a pothole presents at that location and false otherwise. In general, any statement about the physical world, such as ?The bridge fell down?,?The building X is on fire?, or ?The suspect was captured? can be seen as a claim that is true if the statement is correct, and false if it is not.

Without loss of generality, we assume sources report only when a positive value is encountered (e.g., sources only report when she/he observes a pothole on streets).

Let Si represent the ith source and Cj represent the jth  claim. Cj = 1 if it is true and Cj = 0 if it is false. We define a Sensing Matrix SC to represent the relations between sources and claims, i.e., SiCj = 1 indicates that Si reports Cj to be true, and SiCj = 0 otherwise.

In this paper, the uncertainty is defined as the degree of confidence (certainty) a source expresses in his/her report to a claim. In particular, we define an Uncer- tainty Matrix W , where the element wi,j represents the degree of uncertainty source Si expresses on the claim Cj . Considering the difficulty of measuring the exact degree of uncertainty from human generated claims (e.g., text, images, etc.) [52], we define the value of wi,j to be a discrete variable k, where k ? [1,K] and K is the total number of degrees of uncertainty. In particular, wij = k denotes that Si reports the claim Cj to be true with a uncertainty degree of k, where k = 1, ...,K.

The uncertainty degree k that a source expresses in its reports can be extracted from social sensing data using  both syntactic (e.g., RT tag and URL of a tweet) and semantic features (uncertain words, replies from other users) of the claims. The details of the uncertainty degree computation are explained in Section 6. In this paper, we explicitly consider the uncertainty of claims and formulate a uncertainty-aware truth discovery problem in social sensing as follows.

We first define a few terms to be used in the problem formulation. We denote the reliability of source i as ti, which is the probability a claim is true if the source Si reports it. Formally ti is given by:  ti = P (Cj = 1|SiCj = 1) (1)  Note that ti is the overall reliability of a source Si that incorporates all possible uncertainty degrees of Si towards the claims he/she makes. It is not defined for a claim at a particular time instant.

Considering the fact that source Si might have dif- ferent reliability when it reports claims with different degrees of uncertainty [2], we define tki as the reliability of source Si when it reports a claim with an uncertainty degree of k (where k = 1, ...,K). Formally, tki is given by:  tki = P (Cj = 1|SiCj = 1, wij = k) (2)  Therefore,  ti =  K? k=1  tki ? ski si  k = 1, ...,K (3)  where ski is the probability that Si reports Cj with a uncertainty degree of k. For each source, ski can be estimated using the Uncertainty Matrix W . Also note that sources may contribute different number of claims, we denote the probability that Si contributes a claim by si. Formally, si = P (SiCj = 1). Note that si = ?Kk=1s  k i .

Let us further define Ti,k to be the probability that Si reports Cj to be true with a uncertainty degree of k, given that the claim is indeed true. Similarly, let Fi,k denote the probability that Si reports Cj to be true with a uncertainty degree of k, given that the claim is false.

Formally, Ti,k and Fi,k are defined as follows:  Ti,k = P (SiCj = 1, wij = k|Cj = 1) Fi,k = P (SiCj = 1, wij = k|Cj = 0) (4)  Using the Bayesian theorem, we can establish the relation between Ti,k, Fi,k and tki , s  k i as follows:  Ti,k = tki ? ski d  Fi,k = (1? tki )? ski  1? d (5)  where d represents the background probability that a randomly chosen claim is true, which can be jointly estimated in our solution presented in next section.

For completeness, we also define Ti = P (SiCj = 1|Cj = 1) and Fi = P (SiCj = 1|Cj = 0) to represent the probability that source Si reports the truth positives and false positives respectively.

K k=1F  k i ?  ski si  (6)  Therefore, the uncertainty-aware truth discovery prob- lem in social sensing can be presented as a constraint estimation problem: given only the Sensing Matrix SC and Uncertainty Matrix W , the objective is to estimate likelihood of the correctness of all claims and and the reliability of all sources. Formally, we compute:  ?j, 1 ? j ? N : P (Cj = 1|SC,W ) ?i, 1 ? i ?M : p(Cj = 1|SiCj = 1) (7)  3.2 Distinction from Previous Models Before we present the SUTD scheme, we first highlight the difference between our model and a few closely related models from CPS and networked sensing liter- ature [19], [33], [58], [59], [63], [64].

Four recent models in truth discovery are most similar to our model: IPSN 12, RTSS 13, IPSN 14 and IPSN 16 model (shown in Figure 2). First, the IPSN 12 model is the seminal work that formulated the truth discovery problem as a network estimation problem [63]. Second, the RTSS 13 model extended the IPSN 12 model by con- sidering the dependencies between claims. Both IPSN 14 and IPSN 16 considered the source dependency in the truth discovery problem. The difference between them are: the IPSN 14 simplified the source depen- dency graph as a set of two-level disjoint trees [59] while IPSN 16 developed a more generalized model to consider arbitrary source dependency graph (e.g., including multi-hop and cyclic dependency relation- ship) [19]. Moreover, the IPSN 16 also explicitly models the topic relevance feature of the claims. However, none of the above models studied the uncertainty aspect of the claims and the scalability of their schemes to large-scale social sensing events. In sharp contrast to previous work, this paper explicitly incorporates the uncertainty on the reported data and develops a parallel truth discovery solution to address the scalability problem.

As shown in Figure 2, our model includes a set of variables to represent the uncertainty embedded in the claims and can run in parallel on a set of distributed nodes. The details of our SUTD schemed are presented in the following section.

4 AN UNCERTAINTY-AWARE TRUTH DISCOV- ERY (UTD) SCHEME In this section, we solve the constraint estimation prob- lem formulated in the previous section. We developed an UTD scheme using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. We also derive confidence bounds to quantify the estimation accuracy of UTD scheme. In the next section, we extend the UTD scheme to SUTD scheme to address the scalablity challenge.

4.1 Background and Mathematical Formulation  We develop an uncertainty-aware Expectation Maxi- mization (EM) to solve the constraint optimization prob- lem formulated in the previous section. Intuitively, what the EM algorithm generally does is to iteratively estimate the values of the unknown parameters of a model and the values of the latent variables, which are not directly observable from the data [14]. Such iterative process continues until the estimation results converge.

For the constraint estimation problem we formulated in Section 3, the observed data is Sensing Matrix SC and the Uncertainty Matrix W . The estimation param- eter is ? = (T1,k, T2,k, ..., TM,k;F1,k, F2,k, ..., FM,k; d) and k = 1, 2, ..K. Ti,k and Fi,k are defined in Equation (4) and d represents the background probability of a randomly chosen claim to be true. Furthermore, we introduce a vector of latent variables Z to represent the truthfulness of each claim. In particular, a variable zj is defined for the jth claim Cj : zj = 1 if Cj is true and zj = 0 otherwise. Most importantly, in order to incorporate different degrees of uncertainty a source may express on her/his claims into the estimation problem, we define a set of binary variables wkij such that w  k ij = 1 if wij = k in  Uncertainty Matrix W and wkij = 0 otherwise. Therefore, the likelihood function of the uncertainty-aware truth discovery problem is given as:  L(?;X,Z) = Pr(X,Z|?)  = Y? j=1  Pr(zj |Xj , ?)? X? i=1  K? k=1  ?i,j,k ? Pr(zj) (8)  where SiCj = 1 when source Si reports Cj to be true and 0 otherwise. Additional variables are defined in Table 2.

M? i=1  (log?i,j,k + logPr(zj)) (9)  We then define Z(n, j) = p(zj = 1|Xj , ?(n)). It is the probability that a particular claim Cj is true given the observed data and current estimates of the parameters.

Z(n, j) can be further expanded as:     (e) Our	 ?Model  Uncertainty Computa4on	 ?Node  ?   ?   ?   ?   Distribute  Distribute  Distribute  Truth	 ?Discovery	 ?	 ?

(n)|zj = 1)  =  M? i=1  K? k=1  (T (n) i,k )  SiCj && w k ij ? (1?  K? k=1  (T (n) i,k )  1?SiCj )  F (n, j) = p(Xj , ? (n)|zj = 0)  =  M? i=1  K? k=1  (F (n) i,k )  SiCj && w k ij ? (1?  K? k=1  (F (n) i,k )  1?SiCj )  (11)  The Maximization step (M-step) is given by ?(n+1) = arg max? Q(?|?(n)). In the M-step, we select ?? (i.e., T1,k, ..., TM,k, F1,k, ..., FM,k,d) that maximizes the Q(?|?(n)) function in each iteration to be the ?(n+1) of the next iteration.

To get ?? that maximize Q(?|?(n)), we solve ?Q?Ti,k = 0, ?Q ?Fi,k  = 0 and ?Q?d = 0 and get:  N? j=1  [ Z(n, j)?  ( (SiCj && w  k ij) ?   T ?i,k  ? (1? SiCj)  1? ?Kh=1,h6=kTi,h  )] N? j=1  [ Z(n, j)?  ( (SiCj && w  k ij) ?   F ?i,k  ? (1? SiCj)  1? ?Kh=1,h6=kFi,h  )] N? j=1  [ Z(n, j) ? 1  d? ? (1? Z(n, j)) ? 1  1? d? ]  (12)  Solving the above equations, we can obtain optimal T ?i,k, F  ? i,k and d  ? are as follows:  T (n+1) i,k = T  ? i,k =  ?j?SWki Z(n, j)  ?Nj=1Z(n, j)  F (n+1) i,k = F  ? i,k =  ?j?SWki (1? Z(n, j)) N ? ?Nj=1Z(n, j)  d(n+1) = d? = ?Nj=1Z(n, j)  N (13)  where N represents the number of claims in the Sensing Matrix SC and SW ki denotes the set of claims that source Si reports with the uncertainty degree of k. The UTD scheme is shown in Figure 3. Additionally, we summarize the UTD scheme in Algorithm 1.

bounds that can be reached by an unbiased estimator. It is defined as follows:  CRLB = J?1 (14)  where J represents the Fisher information, which is a measure for uncertainty on the estimation parameters given the observed data [35].

Using the likelihood function defined in Equation (8), we can compute the representative element of Fisher Information Matrix as follows:  (J(??est))i,j  =  ?????????????????  0 i 6= j  ? EX [  ?2lsutd(x;Ti,k)  ?T 2i,k  |Ti,k=T? esti,k ] i = j ? [1,M ]  ? EX [  ?2lsutd(x;Fi,k)  ?F 2i,k  |Fi,k=F? esti,k ] i = j ? (M, 2M ]  (15)  where T? esti,k and F? est i,k are the converged values of esti-  mation parameters derived in Equation (13). Note that we use the estimations to approximate the ground truth values of the parameters in the CRLB computation since the ground truth values of the parameters are usually unknown in many social sensing applications [2].

We substitute the likelihood function in Equation (8) and estimated solutions from Equation (13) into Equa- tion (15). And then we get the CRLB, which is the inverse of the Fisher Information Matrix as follows:  (J?1(??est))i,j  =  ???????????????  0 i 6= j Ti,k ? (1?  ?K l=1 Ti,l)  N ? d? (1? ?K  l=1 && l6=k Ti,l) i = j ? [1,M ]  Fi,k ? (1? ?K  l=1 Fi,l)  N ? (1? d)? (1? ?K  l=1 && l6=k Fi,l) i = j ? (M, 2M ]  (16)  Using the CRLB derived above, we can easily compute the derive confidence bounds of the estimation param- eters [62]. In particular, the confidence bounds of Ti, Fi and ti are computed as:  (T?i est ? cp  ? var(T?i  est ), T?i  est + cp  ? var(T?i  est ))  (F?i est ? cp  ? var(F?i  est ), F?i  est + cp  ? var(F?i  est ))  (t?esti ? cp ? var(t?i  est ), t?i  est + cp  ? var(t?i  est )) (17)  where var(T?i est  ) and var(F?i est  ) are the variance of the estimation parameters, which can be directly computed from the CRLBs in Equation (16). cp is the standard score for confidence level p.

5 SCALABLE UNCERTAINTY-AWARE TRUTH DISCOVERY (SUTD) SCHEME To address the scalability limitation of current truth dis- covery solutions, we develop a parallel implementation of the UTD scheme on a Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) using the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) programming model [32]. We refer to this parallel im- plementation of UTD as the Scalable Uncertainty-Aware Truth Discovery (SUTD) scheme. GPU has emerged as a new computing platform for many computational in- tensive applications. CUDA is a parallel programming model invented by NVIDIA. In CUDA, a kernel is defined as a grid of thread blocks and a thread of execution is the smallest unit in the parallelization. In the parallelization process, each node (called a thread node) will take care of a part of the whole computation task and users need to specify a set of kernels to parallelize the computation task.

Several challenges exist in order to implement SUTD: (i) the memory of Graphics Card is limited, so we need to design efficient strategies to handle the large-scale datasets on GPU; (ii) we need to design a mechanism to distribute the computation task of various estimation parameters and hidden variables of SUTD to different threads in an efficient way. To address these challenges, we designed the SUTD based on the estimation model developed in this paper and optimized our implemen- tation using the following techniques: (i) we set the variables used in each thread as local variables instead     E ?

The above optimization leads to significant execution time improvement achieved by SUTD as shown in the next section.

Algorithm 2 SUTD Algorithm Input: Sensing Matrix Matrix SC, Confidence Matrix W Output: Estimations of Source?s Reliability and Claim?s Correctness  1: Initialize ?

The main idea of SUTD is illustrated in Figure 4. Two key steps are designed to implement the SUTD: (1) we set up two different kernels, one for the E-step and the other for the M-step. (2) We allocate the computa- tion tasks of E and M steps to different thread nodes.

The independence of hidden variables and estimation  parameters make the division of computational tasks and parallelization possible. Specifically, in the kernel of E-step, we distribute the computation task of hidden variables (i.e., Zj) to N thread nodes. In the kernel of M-step, we distribute the computation task of estimation parameters (i.e., Ti,k, Fi,k and d) to 2M ?K + 1 thread nodes. We summarize the SUTD scheme in Algorithm 2.

6 REAL WORLD CASE STUDIES In this section, we evaluate the performance of the proposed SUTD scheme through three real-world case studies using data traces collected from Twitter. Given Twitter is designed as an open data-sharing platform for average people, it creates an ideal scenario for unreliable content from unvetted human sources with various de- grees of uncertainty.

In our evaluation, we use the following truth discov- ery solutions as our baselines: ? IPSN12 [63]: it solves the truth discovery problem  using an iterative principle and has been shown to perform better than four current truth discovery schemes in social sensing.

? IPSN14 [59]: it extended the IPSN 12 model by considering the dependencies between sources.

? IPSN16 [19]: it explored topic relevance feature of claims and the arbitrary source dependency be- tween sources.

? RTSS13 [58]: it solved the truth discovery problem by explicitly considering the dependency between claims.

? HITS [23]: it assumes that the relationship between source reliability and claim?s correctness is linear.

? Majority Voting (MV): it simply assumes that a claim is more likely to be true if more sources report that claim.

Additionally, we also included the reference point called Raw, which represents the average percentage of true claims in a random sample set of raw tweets.

Citation information: DOI 10.1109/TBDATA.2017.2669308, IEEE Transactions on Big Data   Data Trace Paris Attack Event Oregon Shooting Event Baltimore Riots Event Starting Date 11/13/2015 10/1/2015 4/14/2015 Duration of Trace Eleven Days Six Days Seven Days Physical Location Paris, France Umpqua, Oregon Baltimore, Maryland Search Keywords Paris, Attacks, ISIS Oregon, Shooting, Umpqua Baltimore, Riots Data Size 186 MB 609 MB 628 MB Number of Tweets 873,760 210,028 952,442 Number of Users Tweeted 496,753 122,069 425,552  Table 3: Data Statistics of Three Traces  We have implemented the above schemes in the Apollo system, which is an information distillation framework the authors have developed to test truth discovery solutions in social sensing applications [59]. In particular, Apollo has two pre-processing components: ? Data Collection Component: it allows users to collect  tweets by specifying a set of keywords and/or geo- locations as filtering conditions and log the collected tweets.

? Data Pre-processing Component: it clusters tweets with similar content into the same cluster by using a clustering algorithm based on K-means and a commonly used distance metric for micro-blog data clustering (i.e., Jaccard distance) [45]. In particular, the Jaccard distance is defined as 1? A?BA?B , where A and B represents the set of words that appear in a tweet. Hence, the more common words two tweets share, the shorter Jaccard distance they have.

Using the meta-data output by the data pre-processing component, we generated the Sensing Matrix SC by tak- ing the Twitter users as the data sources and the clusters of tweets as the the statements of user?s observations, hence representing the claims in our model described in Section 3.

The next step is to generate the Uncertainty Matrix W . In this paper, we focus on the binary case of claim uncertainty (i.e., K = 2). In particular, we use the fol- lowing simple heuristics to roughly estimate the degree of uncertainty a user may express on a tweet. First, if the tweet is an original tweet (i.e., not a retweet) and con- tains a valid URL to an external source as the supporting evidence, it is of low uncertainty. Otherwise, it is of high uncertainty. The hypothesis of this heuristic is mainly twofold: (i) the first-hand information is often of lower uncertainty than the second-hand (e.g., retweet); (ii) including external evidence normally indicates stronger certainty of users. We call the first heuristic as Syntactic as it only uses the syntactic information of the tweets (e.g., RT tag or URL). Second, f the tweet does not contain any uncertain words and symbols (e.g., may, might and ???), it is of low uncertainty. Otherwise, it is of high uncertainty. The hypothesis of this heuristic is that including uncertain words in the tweets normally indicates higher degree of uncertainty from users. We refer to the second heuristic as Semantic as it considers the semantic information of tweets. Lastly, we consider the combination of the above two: if the tweet is an original tweet and contains a valid supporting URL as  well as it does not contain any uncertain words, it is of low uncertainty. Otherwise, it is of high uncertainty. We refer to the third heuristic as Syntactic+Semantic. Note that the above heuristics are only approximations to estimate the degree of uncertainty a source may express on a tweet. In future, we will investigate deeper text analysis techniques (e.g., natural language processing) and study its impact on the claim uncertainty estimation.

For the purposes of evaluation, we select three real world Twitter data traces of recent events. The first trace collected tweets about Paris Attack in Nov, 2015. The second trace collected tweets about the Oregon Shooting that happened in Oct, 2015. The third one was collected from Baltimore Riots in April 2015. The reason for selecting those three data traces from disaster scenario is: those data traces contain more factual observations and their correctness can be verified from external resources. These traces are summarized in Table 3.

We fed each data trace to the Apollo system and executed all the compared truth discovery schemes. We manually graded the output of these schemes to deter- mine the correctness of the claims. Considering the man- power limitations, we took the union of the top 50 claims returned by different schemes as our evaluation set in order to avoid the bias towards any particular scheme.

The following rubric is used to collect the ground truth information of the evaluation set: ? True claims: Claims that are statements of an event,  which is generally observable by multiple indepen- dent sources and can be corroborated by credible sources external to Twitter (e.g., mainstream news media).

? Undecided claims: Claims that do not meet the criteria of true claims.

We note that undecided claims can potentially consist of two types of claims: (i) true claims that cannot be inde- pendently verified by external sources; (ii) false claims.

Thus, our evaluation actually provides pessimistic per- formance bounds on estimations by treating undecided claims as false.

Also note that SUTD scheme is an parallel implemen- tation of UTD scheme. We demonstrate in Section 5 that the parallelization implementation will not miss any information from the input data. In the following discussion, we just present the performance results of the SUTD scheme.

We observe that SUTD schemes generally out- perform the compared baselines in most of the eval- uation metrics: it discovers the most number of true claims while keeping the falsely reported one the least.

Specifically, the largest performance gain is achieved by SUTD-Syn. The performance gain is 20% and 14% on accuracy and F1 score compared to the best performed baselines. The performance results on Oregon Shooting data trace are shown in Figure 6. The SUTD schemes con- tinues to outperform all the baselines. The performance gain achieved by SUTD-Syn+Sem compared to the best performed baseline is 11% and 13% on accuracy and F1 score respectively. The results on Baltimore Riots data trace are shown in Figure 7. The results are consistent with previous experiments. The results on three real world data traces verify the effectiveness of using the SUTD schemes to obtain more truthful information in real world social sensing applications where sources are unvetted and likely to express various degrees of uncertainty on their claims.

We would also like to understand whether the top truthful claims found by different algorithms actually capture the critical events that are newsworthy and reported by media. In particular, we independently col- lected 10 important events covered by mainstream news media (e.g., CNN, BBC) during the Oregon Shooting  Accuracy Precision Recall F1-measure  Es tim  at io  n R  es ul  ts   0.2  0.4  0.6  0.8   SUTD-Syn SUTD-Sem SUTD-Syn+Sem IPSN16 IPSN14 RTSS13 IPSN12 HITS MV Raw  Figure 7: Evaluation on Baltimore Riots Trace  event and used them as ground truths. After that we searched the top 50 ranked claims for each of the com- pared schemes to identify these events. We present the comparison results of the SUTD and the best performed baseline in Table 4. We observe that all ten milestone events are identified in the top claims returned by the SUTD scheme, while three of them are missing from the top claims returned from the best performed baseline.

We repeated the same experiments on Paris Attacks and Baltimore Riots events and the results are similar: SUTD scheme found 8 milestone events in the case of Paris Attacks and 9 in Baltimore Riots compared to 6 and 7 by the best performed baseline.

We also investigated the convergence of the SUTD scheme on the three data traces and the results are presented in Figure 8. We observe the SUTD scheme converges quickly on all data traces.

Finally, we evaluate the efficiency of the parallel imple- mentation of SUTD scheme discussed in Section 5. We implement SUTD on a computer with Nvidia GeFore GPU (2496 cores and 1.25 GHZ for each core, 4GB memory). We compare the SUTD with all baselines. We run the baselines on a regular lab computer (4 cores and 2 GHZ for each core, 8GB memory). Table 5 presents the execution time required by all algorithms on three data traces. We observe that the SUTD scheme runs several orders of magnitude faster than the compared baselines.

The efficiency of SUTD is achieved by judiciously lever- aging the computation power from thousands of cores on the GPU.

7 DISCUSSIONS AND LIMITATIONS This paper presented a SUTD scheme that addressed two fundamental challenges in solving the truth discovery problem in social sensing: the uncertainty of reported data and the scalability of the solution. This work con- tributes to addressing the veracity aspect of the big data problem in CPS applications. While the current results are encouraging, there is room of further improvements.

This section discusses some limitations we identified in the current SUTD scheme as well as the future work that we plan to carry out to address these limitations.

This article has been accepted for publication in a future issue of this journal, but has not been fully edited. Content may change prior to final publication. Citation information: DOI 10.1109/TBDATA.2017.2669308, IEEE Transactions on Big Data   correlation problem has been studied by the authors in a separate line of work by incorporating the joint distribution on claim correlations into the truth discov- ery problem [58]. It worthy of noting that the afore- mentioned solutions on source dependency and claim correlation were developed under the same analytical framework as the SUTD scheme. This allows the authors to quickly develop a more generalized uncertainty-aware truth discovery model that explicitly considers both the source dependency and claim correlation under a unified framework.

The uncertainty estimation heuristics used in the SUTD scheme offer opportunities for future improve- ments. The Syntactic, Semantic, Syntactic+Semantic heuristics are only first approximations. Authors plan to improve them by leveraging more comprehensive tech- niques (e.g., text mining, natural language processing, etc.) to estimate the uncertainty of claims from a deeper analysis of the tweet contents. Some recent efforts pro- vide good insights into this direction by developing new methods to exploit the lexicon, syntax and semantics of data from Twitter [16], [54]. Moreover, the uncertainty estimation module is a plug-in of the SUTD scheme, which gives us the flexibility to substitute it with a more refined one in the future.

In this paper, we mainly focused on the phys- ical events (e.g., disaster and emergency scenarios) as compared to social events (e.g., president elec- tions, protests, uprising, etc.). The reasons are at least twofold: (i) There are a large amount of unfactual ob- servations, sentiments and spams in the social events, which makes the truth discovery task in such context extremely challenging. (ii) The sources have a stronger social dependency in such events and misinforma- tion and rumor spreading is much more significant compared to the physical events. We plan to further generalize the SUTD scheme to handle the unfactual claims and source dependency. In particular, we could model the factualness as an additional property of claims and integrate such property into the truth dis- covery framework. Moreover, we also plan to explicitly model the source dependency and incorporate such dependency into the SUTD scheme in a similar manner as other social-aware truth discovery framework [19], [59].

Considering the scope of the paper, we did not ex- plicitly model the behavior of malicious users. Instead, we model the unknown source reliability in the SUTD scheme where the reliability of sources is not known to the social sensing applications a priori. Previous works have addressed malicious users detection problem and presented approaches to identify malicious user on social media [9], [18]. These results can be readily integrated with the SUTD scheme to solve the truth discovery problem with malicious user identification and removal as a pre-processing step. In particular, we will generalize the SUTD model by incorporating the malicious user detection results as prior knowledge,  which will enforce a faster convergence of the EM algorithm and generate more accurate estimation re- sults. Furthermore, we also plan to extend our current model to explicitly address source dependency and misinformation spread, which is critical to address the collusion attacks from the malicious users.

The time dimension of the problem deserves more in- vestigation. When the uncertainty that a source expresses on claims changes with large dynamics over time, how to best account for it in the estimation framework? A time-sensitive model is needed to better handle such dynamics. Recent work in fact-finding literature starts to develop a new category of streaming EM algorithms that quickly update the estimation parameters using a recur- sive estimation approach [57]. Inspired by these results, the authors plan to develop similar real-time features of our SUTD scheme to better capture the dynamics in the uncertainty change. One key challenge is to design a nice tradeoff between estimation accuracy and computation complexity of the streaming algorithm. The authors are actively working on the above extensions.

8 CONCLUSION This paper presents a Scalable Uncertainty-Aware Truth Discovery (SUTD) scheme to address two fundamen- tal challenges that have not been well addressed in current truth discovery solutions: uncertainty of claims and scalability of algorithms. The SUTD scheme solves a constraint estimation problem to estimate both the correctness of reported data and the reliability of data sources while explicitly considering the uncertainty on the reported data. The SUTD scheme can run a Graphic Processing Unit with thousands of cores, which is shown to run a few orders of magnitude faster than current truth discovery solutions. We evaluated the performance of SUTD in comparison with the state-of-the-art base- lines using three real world datasets collected from Twitter. The evaluation results show that SUTD scheme improves both the estimation accuracy and execution time of current truth discovery solutions. The results of this paper lay out a solid foundation to develop more scalalbe and accurate truth discovery models for big data social sensing applications in future research.
