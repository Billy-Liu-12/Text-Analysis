The Application in Data Mining by Integrating

Abstract - Owing to the threshold setting in generating association rules, the dependencies and implicit meanings ofproducts should be different ifone considers the quantify of ever); item, for instance, the TIDl[(A,9), (B,4)] and TIDZ[(A,2), (B,I)], to infer large item set ABC from item set AB from transaction database or market-basket-data.

Hence, In order to improve the subjective of point view setting, affer generated association rules, the matter-element transformation of Extincs is applied and the $eld of characteristic of matter-element description in Extenics will be replaced with the quantity of every item of corresponding value offuzzzified, i.e. membership degree as furzy theory. According to this, the all related items including items A, B and C con be operated by matter-element and created the fuzzy inference rules to derive a more objective association rule base. Additionalb, the weighted average method will be used for counting the inference value if there were same business transaction in accordance with the transaction list. Thus, the quantiry of item A or B can be inferred ifthe large item set AB can be generated f m m  association rules. From above, the predictions or suggestion works, like as products promotion or add-on services, can be decided by the manager: Final&, we show experimentally that the proposal model can be predicted the customer k trends or extracted implicit information.

Introduction  I The rapidly growing volume and complexity of modem databases makes the need for technologies to describe and summaries the information they contain increasingly important. The general term to describe this process is data mining. Two key issues with association rule mining are the high cost of generating association rule and the large number of rules that are normally generated[?l]. Much work has been done to address the first issue. Methods for reducing the number of rules generated  ? 0-7803-7952-7/03/$17.00 0 2003 IEEE.

A I 1  depend on the application, because a rule may be useful in one application but not another. In this article, we are concemed with the quantity of association rules and substitute the quantity with membership value of fuzzy theory to lessen individual?s subjective threshold setting for discovering patient customer or private?s service.

Association rule mining was first studied in [ I ]  and can be used for prediction if the high cost of finding and applying the rule set is not a concem. Most research work has been on how to mine frequent itemsets efficiently. Apriori [2] is a widely accepted approach, and there have been many enhancements to it [3, 41. In addition, other approaches have been proposed [5, 61, mainly by using more memory to save time.

An association query discovers dependencies among values of an attribute grouped by some other attributes to help the decision-maker to realize the customers? purchasing trends in a given relation or market-basket-data[8].

Consider example in transaction Table 1, which consist of transaction numher, product ID and quantity respectively.

This problem can be converted into Boolean association relation whose tuples include only ones and zeros [6] as Table 2.

In our daily life, some kinds of problems cannot be directly solved by the given conditions. For example, it is impossible to weigh an elephant by a steelyard. However, the problems may become solvable or easier to be solved through some sorts of transformation. The Laplace transformation provides such a good example used in engineering field. Many commonly used techniques are in concept well-known to users. Define the name of a matter by N, one of the characteristics of the matter by CR, and the value about CR by V In extension theory, we use an ordered temary R=(N, CR, V) as the fundamental element to describe a matter and call it a matter-element [ 5 ] .  For example, R=(Andy, Height, 170cm) and R=(Andy, Weight, 60kg) can be used to describe that Andy?s height and weight are 170cm and 60kg, respectively. Thus, different characteristics of the same matter indicate different values.

Based on this properly, we can design different relational functions to describe the values corresponding to the characteristics. Therefore, to solve the incompatible or contradictory problems, Cai [5] created the formal concept of extension set which extends the logic value from [0,1] to (-.o,+m).

Because the quality is no considered in each extracted association rule, we substitute the quality with the membership value of Fuzzy theory and tune those rules for fitting each condition for exploring the mining information.

2. The Extenics-fuzzy mining model  Let I=(1,2 ,..., m] be a set of item, and T c I  be a transaction containing a set of items. An itemset is defmed to he a set of items, and a k-itemset is an itemset containing k items. A database D is a collection of transactions.

Suppose that every transaction is given a unique identifier and we name it by TID. The support of an itemset (e.g. X) is the ratio of the number of transactions containing the items to the number of all transactions in a database, denoted by sup(X). Given two itemsets X and Y where X n Y = 4 ,  an association rule is defined to be X J  Y  where sup (Xu  Y)and sup(X U Y)/sup(X) are not less than user specified thresholds respectively. sup(X U Y)/sup(X) is called the confidence of the rule, denoted by c o n f i x 3  U). The two thresholds are called the minimum suppoi? and the minimum confrdnce respectively. Given a basket relation grouped by transactions as table 1, and utilize the Apriori algorithm to generate the association rules as table 3. Selected a matched rule with the highest confidence from the extracted association rule, and put the consequence of the rule into fuzzy set. We say that a rule matches a transaction if its antecedence is a subset of the transaction.

Because there is no concem quantity and price fields in the extracted association rule, we map the quantity or price with the membership of fuzzy theory and substituted the value field of matter-element defined in Extnics with corresponding membership value. Those matter-element defined is depicted as Eq.(l) to Eq.(3).

(1)  R A  =(i tem-A,quanti ty ,pL(A))  (2) R, = (item - B, quantity, p L  ( B ) )  (3)  R =(item, price, membership degree) or R = (item, quantify, membership degree)  Supposed there are some relation between item-A and item-B, the model can be shown as Eq.(4).

(4) RA, = (item - AB, quantify, p L  ( A )  x pL (B) )  After mined the database, the relation could be presented with fuzzy rule as Eq.(S). That could be translated as the customer will purchase the item-C after buy item-A and item-B.

Ifitem-A is FA, and item-B is FBi, then itemC is FC, ( 5 ) The FA, . FEi and FC, are fuzzy sets of item-A - item-B and item-C, respectively. The trapezoid?s fuzzy sets are shown in Fig 1.

Figure 1. The fuzzy set of item  The extension theory [5 ]  investigates how to formalize the concepts to solve the incompatible or contradictory problem. Denoting the extended relational function by k(x) to relate an element with a set, we can divide the range of the set into three parts. One region has a relational degree greater than zero, another has a degree between zero and -1, and the rest has degree less than -1. If     -1 < k ( x ) < O ,  this means that the element x still has a chance to be included in the normal fuzzy set if the set was adjusted. This motivates us to design a fuzzy model that also considers the regions having the relational degrees between -1 and zero.

Define the extended relational function by k ( x )  to represent the degree of an element belonging to a set. The range of the extension set is [- m,m]  which differs from the fuzzy set in [ 0,1] . This means that an element belongs to any extension set with different degree. The higher the degree, the closer the element belongs to the set. A degree between zero and one, i.e., 0 5 k(x) 5 1, corresponds to the normal fuzzy set. k ( x )  5 -1 implies that the element x has no chance to belong to the set. When -1 < k ( x )  < 0 , this means that the element x still bas a chance to become an element of the set if the set was adjusted. This motivates us to design a f u u y  model which considers the regions having the relational degrees between -1 and zero. Thus, the extenics-based fuzzy model not only adjusts the classical sets but also simultaneously refines the extended sets during the refining process.

Apparently, the fuzzy set theory only considers the elements inside the set and gives different degrees of membership function to the elements. Those who are not inside the set are not discussed in the fuzzy set. However, a training datum which belongs to a specific set may not belong to the neighboring sets at this moment but may fall into those neighboring fuzzy sets once the sets were adjusted. This suggests us to consider the effect of the neighboring fupy  sets to a datum during the f u v y inference. This is why the extenics-based fuzzy model is proposed in this paper. We try to solve this problem by the extended transformation method [13] .

Assuming the isosceles membership functions with 50% overlap with their neighbors are used. Based on the extension theory and from Fig. 2, a datum x located at the ith and (i+l)th membership functions will activate the corresponding fuzzy rules to fire. Thus, only the parameters related to the fired rules will be adjusted in conventional fuzzy model. Here, we define the matter element for the classical region as follows [IO]:  x, CRI,< Ci - 4 ,  Ci + bi > ] (6) R c = [  ,c~z,<Ci+1-4+i~Ci+i+bi+i  ] (7) x,CR3,< Ci-l +bi-,,Ci_, +bi_, +rZi-, ).

where R, and Re are the normal (or classical) and extended matter elements, respectively. c, is the center of the ith function.

, c & <  ~ i + 2 - ~ i + z - ~ i + z , C i + z - b i i 2  > R e = [  Figure. 2. The extended relational functions for the single-input system  Suppose that X, and X are the classical and neighborhood domains of x, respectively. Based on the concept of left-right-sided distance [14], we can define the extended correlation function as follows [14]:  From above, we can derive the following relational functions for each region depicted.

ki (x) = (9) ci + b, - x  bi  In the above equations, c, is the center of the itb function.

The inferred output is obtained as follows:  j=i-l j=i-I  Note that the denominator in Eq.(13) differs from the conventional method in that the absolute value is considered.

Since the relational degree is negative in the extended region, taking the absolute value can prevent the denominator from becoming zero. If the error function is defined as follows:  (14) 1 2 E = $Yc - Y d )  we can use the gradient descent method[l5-17] to adjust the related papramters.

For the data located in the classical fuzzy set, CR I region, the relational degrees can be defined as follows:     c. .  + b . . - x .

Naturally, different membership function should have  (15) k e ( x j ) =  ?I ? I J  degree of CR region can be written as follows:  X-cillj + 4 + 1 j  bi+lj kj+lj(Xj) = (16) different inference output.

A datum fallen into the left extended set, CR region, will have a relational degree as follows: 4. Conclusion  (17) ci-lj + bj-lj - xj  3 - 1 j ki_, j ( x j )  =  Similarly, a datum in the right extended set, CR region, will result in a relational degree as follows:  The new value for the to-be-adjusted p h e t e r  in the next steD is then defined as follows:  6E Ip  p ( t + l ) = p ( t ) - k p - - .

In the above equation, k, is the leaming rate  In this thesis, after mined the transaction database, we transformed the price or quantity fields, which almost ignored in the mining association rules process, to the matter-element of Extenics and utilized F u u y  inference to calculate the threshold of association rules to realize the customers? purchase trend for commercial products promotion or add-on sales. An example is given and the inference output by Fuuy theory excluded the human being?s subjective factor. Simulation results show that given niinimum support, minimum confidence and more than the threshold, 3.49, an implicit commercial chance could he found.

Thus, the Extenics-Fwzy correlation rule can be extracted after analyze the transaction database such that a  Finally, a personalized service can be realized while we  R. Agrwal, T. Imieliski, and A. Swami, ?Mining tune the inference engine.
