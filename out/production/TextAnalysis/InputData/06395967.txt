Abstract: The main objective of this paper is to have a best association between customer and organisation. This  method is proposed in order to discover knowledge from  huge amount of data and to use the data efficiently because  of great demand. Banking is the most commonly used  application for financial section. In which, Enterprise  Resource Planning (ERP) model is most widely used in  order to cost control, accounting and e-business & analyses.

The request of the customers are routed automatically to the  next department when one department finishes their work  of the customer's request and each department have access  to the single database that holds the customers new request.

Customer Relationship Management (CRM) model is  responsible for receiving the request and sending responses  to the customers quickly and directly. The request includes  queries, complaints, suggestions, and orders. These requests  are forwarded to inner view ERP through query generator.

In this paper, we proposed a model that integrates the  customer queries, transactions, databases and all other  specifications used in ERP Systems, then use data mining  techniques to integrate decision making and forecasting.

Using ERP characteristics, data gathered from central  database are in cluster format which is based on action  taken against the queries generated by customers. Later the  clustered data's are used by Apriori algorithm to extract  new rules and patterns for the enhancement of an  organisation.

Keyword: CRM Model, ERP model, Data Mining, Data Clustering, Rule-Base.



I. INTRODUCTION  Most of the companies use an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system in order to improve the core competency. Functionalities of all the business in an organization are integrated into a single system to do the particular needs of various departments and to share the information effectively [1].customer management will be described by CRM model. CRM is process oriented, technological, capability -oriented, strategic perspective [2]. ERP system is most widely used in fmancial section which adds many functions from Financial, Relation management, Production, Distribution, E-Business & analyses [6]. CRM model is responsible for receiving request and sending responses to the customer.



II. LITERATURE REVIEW  Customer Relationship Management (CRM), is examined especially in customer behaviour and customer profiling. Then we describe the general overview of most common data mining techniques. Data mining techniques can extract respectable knowledge from the large customer's database and customer behaviour evaluation is done to improve business performance [1]. Using the ERP database, data mining application is applied to evaluate the best result for the growth and establishment of a company. It integrates the database, customer queries, transactions, and all other specifications used in ERP systems, use data mining techniques to integrate decision making and forecast flows. By using ERP's characteristics, data from central database in cluster format are gathered based on the action taken against the queries generated by the customers. Furthermore, Apriori Algorithm is used to extract new rules and patterns for the enhancement of an organization [2, 3].

Apriori algorithm minimizes the number of candidate sets while generating association rules by evaluating quantitative information associated with each item that occurs in a transaction, which was usually, discarded as traditional association rules focus just on qualitative correlations [6,7]. The proposed approach reduces not only the num ber of item sets generated but also the overall execution time of the algorithm. Apriori algorithm gives solution with higher optimized efficiency by comparing with other algorithms [4]. Some key problems related to these applications of Data Mining are discussed in the CRM [5].



III. ERP-CRM Model  The ERP-CRM model clearly describes how to solve the business problems. Fig.l clearly describes the working of ERP-CRM Model. In the proposed model, automatic response is generated for the customer query [8]. Customer request is directly forward to the concern department for the assessment and positive response.

After statistical analysis and evaluation of the request, the response is directed to the corresponding customer and its feedback will be saved in the database for the future enrichment.

CRMMODEL  CRM Model is responsible for recelvmg and sending requests and responses to the customer directly.

These requests include queries, complaints, suggestions and orders are forwarded to the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) through the query generator. After taking corrective action automatic response generated will be forwarded through the CRM Model as shown in Fig.2.

These transactions will be saved in the database for knowledge rule-base conception.

B.ERPMODEL  In this ERP model, request from the customers are sent to corresponding department for further evaluation, which is shown in Fig.3. Each department has equal access to a single database that holds the customer's data or complaints. For example a customer want to purchase any product will apply for a product through the customer support department (CRM Model) and the request will be forward to the sales department (ERP Model) and sales department will check the payment status in the database and will forward the same request to the operations department for the delivery of  the product and the record will be stored in the database to generate new rules and patterns (knowledge rule-base conception) from the experienced data.

Knowledge rule base consists of historical data collected from various bank, data's selected from the customer query and generation of rules as shown in Table.I.

Among several data mining techniques, Apriori algorithm gives more accurate prediction. The customer queries are clustered and confidence level is set and does pattern matching with the historical data using rule-base in order to generate most accurate solution which is exposed in Fig.4.

IV. DATA MINING USING APRIORI ALGORITHM  Data mining (DM) is a technology by which useful hidden information is found out and extracted from large database, in order to assist decision-maker to search the possible connections among data and discover the possible factors. The DM belongs to the field with high value of application in the database research and integrates database, artificial intelligence, machine  learning, science of statIstIcs and other theories & technologies in several fields. The DM is applied to the commercial banks' CRM mainly in the following ways in DM:  i. Means of Classification ii. Data Clustering  iii. Apriori Algorithm  A. DATA CLUSTERING  Data clustering is to categorise the department of set of customer queries. Some set of numbers are described for each department. This is to identify the customer query belongs to which department. Some queries belong to more than two one department. These queries are sent to both the department. Fig. 5 shows that cluster analysis of gathered customer queries.

Cluster Evaluation graph for the above Table. 1 is shown in Fig. 5.

2 _  3 3   x Fig.5 Cluster Evaluation graph  B. A PRIORI ALGORITHM  The Apriori Algorithm is an prominent algorithm for mining frequent item sets for association rules [9].

Apriori is designed to operate on databases containing transactions (for example, collections of queries from customers, or details of a website frequentation).

Classification using association rules combines association rule mining and classification. It is concerned with finding rules that accurately predict a single solution. In association rule mining, various new rules found can be updated in Rule base.

An association rule is "strong" if its confidence value is greater than a user-defmed threshold.

The association rules are created by combining each large item set with each of its subsets. The Apriori algorithm is an efficient algorithm for finding all frequent item sets. It implements level-wise search using frequent item property and can be additionally optimized.

The Apriori algorithm used is given below.

V. RULE-BASE CONCEPTION  Customer Queries stored in database are tokenized. Most frequently used words or query from a Bank is collected and are stored in a file as shown in Fig.6. The object number for each word in a file is created. Tokenised objects matches with the predefined object number and form a group of numbers. When any combination of object occurs, then it do pattern matching with the predefined queries that are present in the database. If any matches occur then its corresponding solution will be automatically generated to the Customer using CRM Model.

Sample Rules:  If cheque, deposit, way has object number 1, 2, 3 respectively, then to match queryl in Fig. Rules for query one is as follows.

Rule 1: Object List = { 3,2,1 }; No. of objects = 3; It can match in any order. If it matches then its corresponding solution will be generated.

h h ICCCNT'12  t _28  t July 2012, Coimbatore, India    IEEE-20180  For Query 2, If loan, personal, apply has object number 5,6,7respectively, then rule for query2 is as follows  Rule 2: Object List = {5,6,7}; No. of objects = 3; It can match in any order. If it matches then its corresponding solution will be generated.



VI. CONCLUSION  The CRM in commercial banks has become a priority tool for banks to carry out various personalized services as a novel operating mechanism. The automated query generator improves the relationship between banks and customers. The knowledge discovery layer generates new rules and patterns for the improvement of an organization for future correspondence to improve the development of the customers for an organization.
