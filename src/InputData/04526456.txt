Rapid Response to Volcanic Eruptions with an Autonomous Sensor Web: The Nyamulagira

Abstract Rapid response to alerts of impending or active volcanism is vital in the assessment of volcanic risk and hazard. The JPL Model-Driven Volcano Sensor Web (MSW) demonstrated such an autonomous response during a volcanic crisis at Nyamulagira volcano, D. R. Congo, in December 2006, quickly providing vital information to volcanologists in the field. The MSW was developed to enable fast science-driven asset command and control.

Alerts of volcanic activity from around the world are used to trigger high resolution observations (both spectral and spatial) by the EO-1 spacecraft. Data are processed onboard EO-1 by advanced software (the Autonomous Sciencecraft Experiment [ASE]). If volcanic thermal emission is detected, ASE retasks EO-1 to obtain more data.

A summary of the observation is returned within two hours of data acquisition. T12  11-4244-1488-1/08/$25.00 C 2008 IEEE.
