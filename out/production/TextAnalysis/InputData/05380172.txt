Managing Malware in Higher Learning Institutions

Abstract??Malware? is an umbrella term that describes a variety of Internet-borne threats, including viruses, spyware,Trojan horses, spam, bots and more. This sophisticated and evolving security threat puts all businesses at risk, no matter how big or small. Malware creates unique challenges to Higher Learning Institutions (HLI) in protecting their information assets. This is largely due to the fact that HLI Information Technology (IT) departments must balance between enabling a highly collaborative, non-restrictive environment and ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and computing resources. HLIs can proactively defend the network to reduce the risks associated with this threat by assessing the vulnerabilities and threats present in their networks and implementing appropriate multilayer security. A multilayer approach involves applying countermeasures at every layer of the computer network, from the perimeter routers and firewalls to users' personal computers in order to increase network security. The goal of this study is to propose a framework for network security protection against malware to increase the level of protection using non technical countermeasures.

I. INTRODUCTION As the Internet becomes increasingly critical to HLI,  students will be accessing more and more content while exposing the network to new and potentially dangerous network security threats [1]. Educational institutions face a particular set of challenges in fighting malware infiltration.

HLI IT departments must balance between enabling a highly collaborative, non-restrictive environment and ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and computing resources. Additionally, administrators are challenged to make sense of the explosion of intrusion detection system (IDS) alerts[2], a critical yet daunting task given the fact that hackers are infiltrating HLI networks to build botnet command and control servers and exploiting student Web surfing habits for botnet propagation.

Preventing malware infiltration in this advanced?open? network environment needs a multilayered approach. This approach can help HLI to strengthen security across wireless and wired LAN networks. It can also streamline and automate analysis to manage theconstant barrage of IDS  alerts, and collect crucial malware and botnet intelligence.

Honeypots (decoy) can be used to proactively detect and manage infiltration while enabling network managers and users alike to be more effective. Not only can decoy systems be useful to study and protect against malware and exploitation, but they also can be useful in attracting spammers using a variety of techniques. E-mail received on decoy accounts is likely to be originated from spammers especially if the same (or similar) e-mail is received on more than one or a very large number of decoy accounts.

The system can collect the data from the decoy accounts and use it directly to generate spam filter rules, effectively preventing classified spam from being transmitted at major Internet service providers (ISPs) around the world. As a result, the motives and the tactics of the attacker can be learned.



II. SECURING OPEN ACADEMIC NETWORKS Fast-flowing networks and ready access to high-end  computing infrastructures are critical for students, faculty, and staff, if they are to succeed in their pursuits. By its very nature, HLIs? must refrain from imposing too many restrictions, so as to best support uninhibited academic research and discovery. Another unique characteristic of academic networks is that while the university owns the network infrastructure, individuals frequently own the endpoint devices such as laptops, Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) and smart phones. This creates very real challenges to maintain the desired level of security within the infrastructure.

Given the broad range of platforms and applications in use among students, faculty, staff, and guests, there are few commonalities that can be leveraged in implementing new physical and logical security controls. And taking into account the sheer volume and variety of users and devices accessing university resources, plus the reality that IT has limited visibility into those endpoints, means that deploying and provisioning (let alone enforcing) any new agent-based security controls are difficult at best. Attackers are exploiting these very shortcomings to launch botnet and other malware attacks like phishing.

HLI need to acknowledge antivirus, intrusion prevention systems and other logical and physical measures alone cannot detect the emerging network security threat that is the result of increasingly sophisticated methods of attack   DOI 10.1109/ICCEE.2009.93    DOI 10.1109/ICCEE.2009.93     and the blending of once distinct types of attack into more complex, covert and damaging forms of attacks which are happening every day [2, 3]. A multilayered approach is needed to provide robust protection with emphasis on non technical measures against Malware while at the same time balancing the ?open? environment and security goals. A multilayered approach ensures complete security viz.

availability, confidentiality and integrity, each layer corresponding to one aspect of security. The layers are sequential and overlapping i.e. layer one followed by layer two followed by layer three, where each layer has some unique features and some features from its previous layers.

This ensures that each layer is stand alone and isable to effectively block the type of attack (Fig. 1) which it is meant to block.

The security model as shown in Fig.2 is an abstraction used to define entities and how these entities are allowed to interact. A security model begins as a set of definitions on paper, but eventually the model is implemented in software, hardware, or both. The implementation should be accurate and adhere to the model specification. If the implementation is flawed, the framework [4] will lack the capability to provide confidentiality, integrity and availability.

III. LITERATURE REVIEW Based on the literature research done, this study has its  roots in two previous studies Jones et al. 1993[5] Schmidt and Arnett, 2005[6]. Both of these had a goal of examining relatively new malware as it emerged on the computing landscape. In this study both malware and the current antimalware measures will be compared and analyzed.

Thereafter in-depth studies of several security models will be undertaken to investigate and evaluate organizational network security.

Current solutions of defense for network security are mostly reactive and static methods, which are used to collect, analyze and extract evidences after attacks. This approach includes virus detection, frangibility evaluation, and firewalls and more. They rely upon collecting and analyzing the viruses? specimens or intrusion signatures with some traditional techniques, such as statistical analysis, characteristics analysis, neural network, and data mining.

However, these approaches result in a slow reaction time to new threats. This is largely due to the lack of self-learning and self-adapting abilities as they can only prevent those known network intrusions, and can do very little or nothing for the unknown intrusions.

In the real network environment, the incursion threat has risen as well as the attack class numbers. As a result, HLIs are constantly investing in new information technology and in business information systems security in particular. These security expenditures have constantly increased over the last few years [7]. The expenditure is mostly on widely used security tools such as firewalls, antivirus, Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), encrypted channels, and more. Although the tools are effective to a certain extent, there are objective shortcomings related to all existing security tools and mechanisms. They solve just the technical side of the security problem and fail to address most of the nontechnical side [8].

Figure 3. Proposed Conceptual Framework.

In this study we propose a conceptual framework (Fig.3) which focuses on the non technical measures, basically     dealing with the social layer. This has been compounded by the trends toward mobility, increasing Web traffic and the rising popularity of e-commerce, search and social networking applications (e.g. facebook, myspace and twitter) which have all significantly impacted HLI security. Security of networked systems requires both technical and administrative foundations [9]. Technical foundations like those based on cryptographic measures and access control models, are well understood. However the administrative foundation which is based on several non-technical layers added on top of technical ones has taken a back sit. Clearly for malware to be effectively managed there must be a marriage between the technical and nontechnical layers.

Due to the scarcity of Network Security models specifically addressing HLIs with an emphasis on nontechnical measures, the study will be based on four security models (SANS? Network Security Model[10], Neumann [11], Blackwell [12], and Microsoft?s Defense in Depth[13]) which will help in providing some guidance in the development of the proposed network security framework (Fig. 3). This framework can be applied not only to HLIs but also any other type of organization.

In this research in progress study we intend on using both qualitative and quantitative (mixed) methods [14] in the gathering of information in order to enhance reduction of malware on networks. For the qualitative, we shall interview key technical staff from the HLIs? IT departments to establish the control measures in use. We shall then conduct a survey (quantitative) at three educational institutions to make a comparative analysis of malware landscape by analyzing students? perceptions on combating malware. The three HLIs were selected for the survey because they are technologically innovated and publicly funded. The unit of analysis to be used will be IT students from the selected HLIs. In order to refine our survey a pilot study will be undertaken at one of the HLIs.There after we shall propose a framework with emphasis on non technical measures using a multilayered approach. In order to validate the proposed framework we shall focus on HLI?s students? perceptions towards malware,network security and the existing defense measures [14].



IV. CONCLUSION Overall this study examines malware as it affects HLIs  and thereafter conducts a survey and comparative analysis of several security models. From the preliminary study, we believe that the malware threat poses a significant and  increasing problem for HLIs. Different types of attackers usually attempt different attacks depending on their position, privileges and knowledge. Although there is a wide range of technological security measures, there are still very few solutions which largely focus on non technical measures.

Therefore a well structured multilayered Network Security Framework will give the information security community a way to study, implement, and maintain network security that can be applied to any HLI.
