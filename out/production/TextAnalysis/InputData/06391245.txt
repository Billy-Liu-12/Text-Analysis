A flexible novel approach to learn epistasis based on ant colony  optimization

Abstract: Epistasis learning is becoming more and more important in genome-wide association (GWA) studies as single loci association test could only explain a small proportion of heredity of common human diseases. Many epistasis or gene-gene interaction learning methods have come out to try to solve the problem which is on the way of learning epistasis, which is computable difficult to search for high order epistatic interactions underlie common human disease and they have shown quite an ability to work on such a problem. But as single nucleotide polymorphism?s (SNP) dimensionality is growing larger and larger in current generated genome-wide association datasets, of which the number of samples that could be used to do GWA analysis is smaller relatively. How to solve the problem of epistasis learning caused by this dimensionality disaster is still a critical challenge for our genetic scientists. In this article, we propose a novel approach which could find a gene-gene interaction model consists of a flexible number of susceptible loci based on ant colony optimization (ACO) strategy and we conduct a lot of experiments on a wide range of simulated datasets and compare the outcome of our ACO method with some other epistasis learning methods like Bayesian combinational method (BayCom) and Multi beam search method (MBS), found that our ACO method is quite available and time efficient to solve the haystack problem to learn epistatic interactions and it may become a potential solution to search for complex association rules between susceptible SNP subset and common human disease in the future.

Key Words: Epistasis, genome-wide association, gene-gene interaction, single nucleotide polymorphism, ant colony optimization, Bayesian combinational method, Multi beam search method  1 Introduction Genome wide association (GWA) studies, which aim at  exploring underlying genetic causes of complex diseases by detecting association between one or more genetic polymorphisms and a trait of interest such as a quantitative characteristic, discrete attribute or disease [1]. Great success has been made in identifying genetic variants responsible for Mendelian diseases, but genetic principle of many complex diseases remain mysterious. One reason for this phenomenon is the existence of epistasis, or epistatic interactions [2].

Epistasis has been recognized for many years as a potential main component of genetic structure of common biological traits and has been defined in different ways. Biologically, epistasis refers to physical interactions between biomolecules (e.g. DNA, RNA, proteins, enzymes, etc.).

Statistically, epistasis refers to a deviation from additivity in a linear statistical method. The detection of statistical epistasis has the potential to identify interacting genetic loci that likely underlie the inheritance of common disease.

Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is a common mutation which is caused when a single nucleotide is replaced by another in the genome sequence. Typically, a large scale dataset for association studies may have several tens to hundreds of thousands of SNPs and such a high dimensionality SNP dataset is a big challenge to our work of epistasis learning. For example in order to detect pair wise interactions from 500,000 SNPs genotyped in thousands of   This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of  China (91130033, 61175024), Shanghai Science and Technology Commission (11JC1404800), a Foundation for the Author of National Excellent Doctoral Dissertation of PR China (201048), and Shanghai Pujiang Program.

samples, we need 111.25 10  statistical tests in total. Many methods that detect epistasis on the basis of the statistical definition have come out like linear and logistic regression, multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR), set association analysis and so on [3]. Of them, MDR shows a great ability on detecting associations between multiple SNPs and hereditary disease such as Sporadic Breast Cancer, essential hypertension, bladder cancer and atopic dermatitis. Shyam et al. [4] provide a new method, Bayesian combinational method (BayCom), in which evaluates the correlation between SNP subset and the phenotype using a Bayesian rule and gets better results on power and time efficiency than MDR on synthetic datasets. Xia et al. [5] represent the correlation between SNP subset and disease status by using a Bayesian network (BN) and uses a heuristic algorithm, Multiple Beam Search (MBS) to accelerate the speed of the Bayesian combinatorial method [6]. But these methods have a common weakness which is the difficulty to search for high order multi-SNP interactions in a real GWA dataset whose SNP dimensionality is large. Aim on solving the complexity of computation of such a problem, a new wave of epistasis learning methods have arisen, they can be grouped into two classes, one is using a two stage analysis in which they use a filtering method to get a subset consists of interesting loci groups firstly and then conduct exhaustive testing of high order multi-loci interaction to search for epistasis hidden underlie the complex biological trait, the other is called wrapper method which uses heuristic methods to find epistatic interaction in the whole space of genetic loci [7].

Filtering methods like SNPharvester, BOOST and Screen and Clean have been used separately on the datasets of bipolar disorder (BD), coronary artery disease (CAD), Crohn disease (CD), hypertension(HT), rheumatoid arthritis     (RA), type 1 diabetes (T1D), and type 2 diabetes (T2D) from the Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium (WTCCC) [8,9,10]. Wrapper methods mainly solve the epistasis learning problem with an evolutionary probabilistic search wrapper like ant colony optimization or genetic programming strategy. Ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm was developed by Macro Dorigio in 1992, which is based on the mechanism by which ant colonies find the shortest route to a food source [11]. It has been shown to be efficient in high-dimension datasets.  Greene et al. [12] explored the use of ACO on GWA study and they demonstrated that successful application of ACO strategy on GWA problem required consideration of expert knowledge prevent single SNP dominating the search space and a two stage system, AntEpiseeker, has been provided by Wang et al. [13] to process simulated datasets and the rheumatoid arthritis WTCCC dataset which showed superior performance than SNPharvester method.

In this paper, we also use a BN to represent correlation relationship between SNP subset and disease status like MBS method and try to consider the identification of groups of interacting SNPs as an optimization problem. So we would use an ant colony optimization (ACO) strategy to solve the computation complexity of its. In the case of SNP association studies, the ?path? is represented by a selected SNP subset, and its performance is evaluated according to the value of K2 score of BN constructed by the selected SNP subset. Compare with other epistasis learning methods, we don?t confine the number of a selected SNP subset and give it an upper bound like 4 instead to prevent from the failure of our method because of few samples, and then we could get an optimal solution from the scope of 1~4 SNPs combination which make the selected SNP combinations? dimensionality more flexible. We conduct experiments on a wide range of synthetic datasets and get good power and time performance of our method and find that as the increase of SNP dimensionality, our method?s power won?t be weaken too much especially when sample size is large. We also compare the power performance of our method with BCM and MBS method, and find that our ACO method shows superior power performance in detecting right epistatic interactions as the increase of dataset size.

2 METHODs  2.1 Epistasis model constructed by Bayesian network  A Bayesian network is a probabilistic model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional dependences via a directed acyclic graph (DAG) [14].

Suppose we have a joint probability distribution P of a set of random variables, then it could be described by a DAG, G= (V, E), where V is the set of vertices which represents random variables in G and E is the set of edges which represent the conditional dependences between variables, such that (G, P) satisfies the Markov Condition if for each variable X V, X is conditionally independent of the set of all its non-descendents given the set of all its parents.

We use such a BN to construct an epistasis model to represent the association relationship between a SNP subset and the disease we?re studying. Through this model we could evaluate if a SNP subset is susceptible or not with the  according disease by using a K2 score seen in equation 1. In this way, the larger the score of a BN constructed by a SNP subset is, the more associated with the disease state it is. A Bayesian network model constructed by a 3-SNP subset could be seen in Fig. 1 which represents association relationship between three distinct SNPs, S1, S2 and Si with the according disease D.

So we use BN to model the relationship between SNP subset and the disease. And in the BN model, if k SNPs is connected to the disease D, then we call it a k-SNP interaction model. According to the equation 1, then we could calculate its K2 score and the bigger the score is, the more associated between SNP subset and the disease it is.

We get susceptible genetic loci groups in this way. But actually the factorial of a big number is hard to store and represent in a usual computer, so we translate K2 score to its log form and get its absolute value in our method, then we get our log form score which could be seen in equation 2. So the smaller the log form score is, the stronger the association signal between SNP subset and the disease is.

The principle of the ACO is not complex in which it employs artificial ants that communicate through a probability density function (PDF) which is updated with pheromone levels within each iteration, which are analogous to the chemical pheromones used by real ants.

In the case of genome wide association studies, the search space consists of all the SNPs and their combinations in the genome. The ants traverse routes which could be any  S1 S2 Si Sn  D     possible SNP or their combinations. Pheromone values are stored as a matrix , whose dimensionality is SNP dimensionality of the GWA dataset we study, whose element represents the pheromone value laying between its column label SNP and row label SNP. In this way, pheromone values within the pheromone matrix will reflect a signal distribution which is weak or strong according to association strength between the 2-locus group and the disease. The pheromone value between each two SNPs is initialized at the start of the program run to the same fixed value controlled by the initial-pheromone parameter 0 .

The probability of sampling SNP j by ant k is defined in equation 3:  ( )  ( ( )) ( , )  k  ij j k  iu uk u J i  if j J i p i j  otherwise (3)  Where, i is the SNP node that has been visited by ant k, ( )kJ i is the set of neighbor nodes of SNP node i that have  not yet been visited by ant k, ij  is pheromone value  between SNP node i and SNP node j and j  is some form of  priori information on SNP node j. and  are parameters determining the weight given to pheromone and a priori information on the features, respectively. In our work we let  equal to 1 so we treat each locus equally and also we let equal to 1.

The ACO is initialized with all loci having an equal level  of pheromone 0 . Each artificial ant k will select an SNP  subset kA of l loci from the whole space of genomic SNPs in which l is not invariable and detailed description of the length of l could be seen in next section. Then the SNP subset kA  will be used to construct a naive Bayesian network model like figure 1 shows. Each suspected SNP subset will be evaluated by using the log form K2 score in equation 2. The pheromone level of each path between two loci will be updated based on the performance of kA , as:  (1 )ij ij ij                       (4) Where ij  is the pheromone value between SNP node i and  SNP node j, ijij  is the changing pheromone value between SNP i and SNP j,  is evaporate coefficient between 0 and 1.

{ } ( )  { }  k kij  ij k  Q if ij A score A  if ij A (5)  Where Q  is a constant, ( )kscore A  is the log form K2 score  of the SNP subset kA .

This process is repeated for every artificial ant in each  iteration process.

2.3 Algorithm used to learn epistasis  Suppose we have a dataset which has L samples whose SNP dimensionality is n. The main component of our algorithm, PATH Seeking Procedure, is described as above, score (Ai) is log form K2 score of the epistasis model that has edges from SNP subset Ai to the disease state D.

Transition rule:    arg max { } ( )  ( ) iu A ju  if q P j  J if q P (6)  Where q is a random number which is uniformly distributed in [0, 1]; ( )kJ J i  is a SNP node randomly selected  according to the probabilities in eq. (5); ( )kJ i is the set of neighbor nodes of node i that that have not yet been visited  by ant k, 0P is the threshold to determine if a random selection step needs being started and we set it to 0.8.

At last we will get an optimal SNP subset which contains not more than l loci. The number, l is not invariable but changes according to the accuracy determined by K2 score of a Bayesian network which is constructed by this suspected subset and also we always let l float not above an upper bound, 4 for example in our later experiments.

3 Experiments In our experiments on the simulated datasets, we will  discuss our method?s availability on two aspects, power effectiveness and time efficiency. We use the number of successful identifications to measure the power of each method.

[16] were used in our experiments to test the efficiency and effectiveness of our method. These datasets were produced based on 70 genetic models of gene-gene interactions. Each model represents a distinct correlation relationship between two susceptible loci with the disease. To study the effect of dataset size, 100 datasets were produced for each of four dataset sizes 200, 400, 800 and 1600. Each dataset contains equal number of case and control samples. Within each dataset, there are a generated pair of epistatic SNP values and other sets of random generated synthetic SNPs. To study the effect of SNP dimensionality, the number of random generated SNPs varies within 18, 38, 78 and 158. The data sets could be obtained from http://discovery.dartmouth.edu /epistatic_data/.

3.2 Parameter setting  In our work, we use the variable Stop_num as an indicator to predict if our program is satisfied with the stopping criterion, in which the stopping criterion is satisfied if iterative optimal SNP subset remains unchanged for Stop_num times. And after the stopping criterion is satisfied, it will break up from the iterative circulation. So the maximum number of iterations would not need being considered too much in our method.

We will discuss three parameters which will have big impacts on our method?s effect and efficiency. Notably the size of population of ants, Ant_num, the number of iterations required to satisfy the stopping criterion, Stop_num, the pheromone evaporation rate, . The selection of these parameters reflects a trade-off between the computational power available and the scope of the search required. The outcomes demonstrated in Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 are the results when ACO method is applied to 7000 datasets whose sample size is 1600 and SNP dimensionality is 20.

First, the number of duplicate iterations required to satisfy the stopping criterion, Stop_num is set within 6~9, which determines convergence speed and accuracy of the algorithm.

To verify its availability we compare the outcome obtained by ACO method with this stopping criterion and without it in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3.

Fig. 2: Time consuming comparison between ACO methods with or without Stopping Criterion  Fig. 3: Power comparison between ACO methods with or without Stopping Criterion  We could see that ACO method with this stopping criterion would increase its speed greatly without influencing its accuracy which proves that this stopping criterion is available in our ACO strategy to learn true epistasis models.

Then, the number of ants, Ant_num, typically sets to equal with SNP_num (SNP dimensionality, the number of SNPs of each individual sample of the dataset we use), determines the extent to which the scope of SNPs combination space is searched for before evaporation. A larger number of ants promotes exploration of the search space and so should be larger for more extensive GWAS. In order to consider more effect of the method, we set Ant_num to equal with SNP_num to search for the optimal SNP subset as far as possible. And we compared different outcomes obtained by different settings of Ant_num in various datasets (see Fig. 4).

And we could see that as the increase of Ant_num, accuracy of ACO method remains almost unchanged, and the time consuming by calculating out the optimal SNP subset increases at first, then decreases for large parts and reaches minimum time consuming when Ant_num is equal with SNP_num. To investigate this phenomenon?s reason, we compared time consuming by each ant at different setting of Ant_num (see Fig. 5), in which time consuming by each ant will decrease rapidly when ant number increases. As time spent by our ACO method is mainly decided by two factors, one is ant number, the other is iterative time needed by each ant. When ant number increases, the initial searching scope would be widened and then more quickly our method will converge at each ant?s traversing. So time consuming by our method to find the optimal SNP subset will increase first and then decrease as the increase of ant number.

+  Fig. 4: Comparison of power and time efficiency performance between distinct ant numbers     Fig.5: Comparison of time consuming by each ant between distinct ant numbers.

At last, we will discuss evaporate rate , which is usually set between 0.01~0.2, smaller values promote slower convergence and therefore greater exploration of the search space, whereas larger values will tend to converge on a solution more quickly [17]. Considering a trade-off between the computational power and the scope of the search required, we set to 0.1 in our paper.

Setting of these three parameters above only considers our simulated datasets used above. If you try to search for a best SNP subset of a new GWAS dataset, these parameters may need some modifications according to our advice provided above.

3.3 Power and time computation  At first, we describe our method?s different power performance under distinct SNP dimensions (number of SNPs of each individual sample) and distinct dataset sizes (number of samples in a dataset) which could be seen in Fig.

6. Then, we showed our method?s time efficiency to compare its time consuming on different SNP dimensions and different dataset sizes of simulated datasets. The result could be seen in Fig. 7. At last, we compared our ACO method?s power with BayCom method and MBS method on 7000 datasets whose SNP dimension is 20. The results could be seen in Fig. 8.

Fig. 6: Different power performance under different settings of datasets in ACO method  We could see some characteristics of our ACO method in learning epistasis from Fig. 6. First, sample size is very important for case-control studies and the statistical power is  often increasing rapidly by increasing sample size. As dimension increases, the power of ACO method decreases like any other epistasis learning method, but this effect would be weaken when sample size is becoming larger.

Fig. 7: Different time efficiency performance under different settings of datasets in ACO method  From Fig. 7, we could see the time consuming to calculate out results of 7000 synthetic datasets is growing as the SNP dimension of datasets grows. And large size datasets tends to need more time to calculate out their optimal results.

Fig. 8: Power comparison between BayCom, MBS and ACO with different dataset sizes  Through comparison between these three different methods BayCom, MBS and ACO in Fig. 8, we could see that BayCom method and MBS method show equal power performance so they display as a same line in Fig. 8 and our ACO method is a little superior in searching for epistasis especially as the increase of the sample size of datasets and it proves our method?s availability on learning epistatic interactions to some extent.

4 Discussion  In this work, we provide a novel method based on ant colony optimization algorithm to learn epistasis flexibly which has a potential to become an available method to learn epistatic interactions in real genome-wide datasets. We conduct some experiments on parameter setting, especially on ant number?s setting. We find two factors mainly influence time efficiency of our ACO method, one is ant number and the other is time needed by each ant during the optimization process and, based on this principle, we set ant     number to equal with the number of a dataset?s SNP dimensionality in our work when adopting a stopping criterion which have proven to be available. We have done a wide range of experiments on simulated datasets with it and get satisfying results of power and time consuming, especially on large sample sizes. As the increase of SNP dimensionality, our ACO method?s accuracy will decrease to some extent, but if the sample size is large enough, this effect will be weaken. We also compare our method with two methods which are provided by Shyam et al. [4] and Xia et al.

previously on datasets with SNP dimensionality 20 and varying sample sizes. We found that when the sample size is small, our method is comparable with these methods, but as the increase of sample sizes of datasets, ACO method is performing more superior than the other two methods which shows our ACO method?s availability on learning epistasis.

Like MBS method, our ACO method also is applicable to the dataset which has a pair of SNPs joint together associated with disease status and other SNPs are associated with disease status based on this pair of SNPs. In the future, we will go on conducting more experiments on other synthetic datasets produced by other more complex epistatic interaction models whose probably relation between SNP subset and disease state is distinct to further improve our ACO method?s availability. Also we would try it on a new GWAS dataset to test its effect to find true biological genetic mechanism underlie the enormous amounts of SNP data items.
