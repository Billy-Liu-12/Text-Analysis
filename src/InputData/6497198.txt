Abstract? Set to fly in the Fall of 2013 from Ft. Sumner, NM,  the High Energy Replicated Optics to Explore the Sun  (HEROES) mission is a collaborative effort between the NASA  Marshall Space Flight Center and the Goddard Space Flight  Center to upgrade an existing payload, the High Energy  Replicated Optics (HERO) balloon-borne telescope, to make  unique scientific measurements of the Sun and astrophysical  targets during the same flight. The HEROES science payload  consists of 8 mirror modules, housing a total of 109 grazing-  incidence optics. These modules are mounted on a carbon-fiber  - and Aluminum optical bench 6 m from a matching array of  high pressure xenon gas scintillation proportional counters,  which serve as the focal-plane detectors. The HERO gondola  utilizes a differential GPS system (backed by a magnetometer)  for coarse pointing in the azimuth and a shaft angle encoder  plus inclinometer provides the coarse elevation. The HEROES  payload will incorporate a new solar aspect system to  supplement the existing star camera, for fine pointing during  both the day and night. A mechanical shutter will be added to  the star camera to protect it during solar observations.

HEROES will also implement two novel alignment monitoring  system that will measure the alignment between the optical  bench and the star camera and between the optics and  detectors for improved pointing and post-flight data  reconstruction. The overall payload will also be discussed. This  mission is funded by the NASA HOPE (Hands On Project  Experience) Training Opportunity awarded by the NASA  Academy of Program/Project and Engineering Leadership, in  partnership with NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Office  of the Chief Engineer and Office of the Chief Technologist.
