Automatic Code Generation for Spacecraft Attitude

Abstract- Government and commercial customers are increasingly interested in robust, reusable flight software. For  many spacecraft, Attitude Determination and Control  Subsystem (ADCS) contributes a significant portion of the  FSW. Thus refinements to ADCS code pay dividends for code  development and reuse. Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC) has  recently developed an ADCS model and code set that follows  model based design techniques. It uses Simulink for algorithm  design and verification, a modular parameter database to  customize mission profiles, and automatic code generation to  create production quality embedded software. The code will be  used on a LEO Earth imaging nanosat. This paper presents an  overview of the algorithms, model architecture, parameter  database, and code generation process.
