Technology Forecasting of Digital Single-Lens Reflex Camera Market:   The Impact of Segmentation in TFDEA

Abstract--With the advancement of digital image technology,  the big change in the camera market is that digital single-lens reflex cameras (DSLRs) have replaced film type single-lens reflex cameras, which have seen very little development lately.

This advancement is reflected in some core technologies of DSLRs such as digital image sensors and electronic shutter mechanisms, which have allowed taking photographs even in the toughest conditions. Therefore, as a disruptive technology, the developments in DSLR technologies are worthy of notice.

This paper utilizes technology forecast using data envelopment analysis (TFDEA), which is a quantitative forecasting method. In the study, we use input and output data collected from about a hundred DSLRs of the top five currently dominant brands such as Canon, Nikon, Sony, Pentax and Olympus. Final results show future DSLRs? capabilities and provide insight that TFDEA, as a forecasting method, can be applicable to determine market trends of consumer electronics as well as technologies. Furthermore, the results showed that market segmentation provided more reliable and accurate results with lower mean absolute deviation (MAD) value while all camera market approach provided less accurate results with a high standard deviation or MAD value.



I. INTRODUCTION   With the advancement of digital image technology, the big change in the camera market is that digital single-lens reflex cameras (DSLRs) have replaced film type single-lens reflex cameras, which have seen very little development lately. This advancement is reflected in some core technologies of DSLRs such as digital image sensors and electronic shutter mechanisms, which have allowed taking photographs even in the toughest conditions. Today, DSLR cameras are becoming more popular among photographers and enthusiasts. There are a lot of advantages of DSLRs compared with the compact point and shoot cameras, for example; the bigger sensor size, several choices of lens, high image quality, higher level of camera control and versatility for shooting in any light condition, which makes a DSLR a good choice for most of professional photographers as well as amateurs [1]. As of 2012, there are seven manufactures dominating the DSLRS? market for a generation or more.

These manufacturers are; Canon Inc., Nikon Corp, Sony Corp, Olympus Corp, Pentax, Fuji and Panasonic Corp. They all have their own representative products of DSLRs.

The data from Camera & Imaging Products Association (CIPA) is a good proxy for discovering trend in the camera industry. Based on CIPA?s data, revenue from DSLR cameras is growing slowly and the unit shipments are growing albeit at a much slower pace. Fig. 1 shows the total unit shipped of DSLR cameras and basic cameras[2]. The forecast for total  shipment (the cumulative total of shipments from January to December) of DSLR cameras in 2010 is 109.9 million units, a year-on-year increase of 3.8% [3].

Fig. 1 Total unit shipped of DSLR cameras and basic cameras from CIPA [2]   Trends in the DSLRs camera market have implications on  other technologies. For example, higher resolution of digital camera sensors results in bigger file size which requires improvement of memory card technology to be able to handle larger files in terms of the capacity and writing speed, the improvement of in-camera image processor chip to be able to process image quickly, and the improvement of computer hardware to be able to support massive image file processing.

The potential benefit of the result would assist all the manufacturers to get ready to promote their competitive products and other industries to get ready to adapt to the change in technology.



II. LITERATURE REVIEW   A. Technology Forecasting  Technological forecasting is aimed at predicting future technological capabilities, attributes, and parameters. That is, a technological capability or attribute can be forecast to be available at some time in the future [4].

Methods for technology forecasting are broadly classified into two main categories: exploratory forecasting and normative forecasting. Exploratory forecasting means forecasting the future based on past data and present conditions. A good choice of a technology forecasting method in a particular situation could affect the usefulness and accuracy of the forecast [5].

B. DEA ? Data Envelopment Analysis  The DEA model was introduced in the 1970s, and for many years, it got recognized relatively quickly. Their work   2013 Proceedings of PICMET '13: Technology Management for Emerging Technologies.

Fig. 2 The general structure of a DEA model (envelopment form) [7]   extended the theory underlying DEA, made progress enhancing the computational aspects of the analysis, and reported on selected applications. As application catches up with theory, the DEA model promises to find more significant use in the future [6].

The purpose of DEA is to determine which of the DMUs make efficient use of their inputs and which do not. For the inefficient units, the analysis can actually quantify what levels of improved performance should be attainable. In addition, the analysis indicates where an inefficient DMU might look for benchmarking help as it searches for ways to improve [6].  Fig. 2 shows the general structure of a DEA model.

C. TFDEA ? Technology Forecasting using Data Envelopment Analysis  ?Technology Forecasting Using Data Envelopment Analysis? (TFDEA) was introduced in 2001 [8]. TFDEA is an extension of ?Data Envelopment Analysis? (DEA) as an operation research method. After its introduction, TFDEA has been a favorable approach to obtain technological predictions [9]. One fundamental concept for TFDEA is being ?state-of-the-art (SOA)? technology, which indicates a technology?s superiority over the others for the time being that the analysis is performed. If a technology is SOA, its efficiency score is assigned as 1, by considering the historical levels of performance. TFDEA assigns the subsequent efficiency scores for each of the remaining technologies based on the preceding SOA technology [9].

In TFDEA, we need an efficiency score at the time of release and against what is assumed to be the current time (or the period at which the frontier is considered frozen). These are denoted by an R or C respectively [10]. Technology Forecasting with Data Envelopment Analysis (TFDEA) offers an effective means to determine technological capability over time without the burden of fixed a-priori  weighting schemes [10]. TFDEA explains advancement of technology by capturing dynamics of efficiencies over time.

Hence, it requires series of efficiency measurement based on DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) [11].



III. MODEL AND DATA   A. Model  Many variables have been considering in the project for forecasting the DSLR camera technology. However, not all the characteristics that use in marketing can be used in forecast this technology such as megapixel and ISO. The technical characteristics would be constructed into structural variables; MSRP and weight of the DSLR cameras (used to achieve better performance) and functional variables; resolution, focus point, and max FPS as shown in Fig. 3 below. A clear explanation of the characteristics is given in the paper for a better understanding.

Fig. 3 Basic input-output model of DSLR cameras  The method used is the forecasting of technology using  data envelopment analysis first proposed in PICMET 2001 by Anderson et al [12]. Lim and Anderson succeeded in developing the add-in program for running TFDEA in Microsoft Excel [11]. The program comes with some specific options needed to be set before running the program as followed.

2013 Proceedings of PICMET '13: Technology Management for Emerging Technologies.

Fig. 4 Application Programing Interface (API) dialogue box  B. Frontier  There are two options that need to consider under the define frontier, Static and Dynamic frontier. However, when choosing the target frontier, it should be based on the nature of technology itself. Some of them are developed every year same as the DSLR technology, and the other might be for every three to five years. Moreover, after choosing frontier  type, the target frontier has to decide which data set will be the forecasting period, and which set will be the learning period [10].

C. Return to Scale  Under the return to scale option, there are four types of return to scale: constant return to scale (CRS), increasing return to scale (IRS), decreasing return to scale (DRS) and variable return to scale (VRS). The state-of-art of technology and the change of efficiency will depend upon the return to scale. Therefore, it is important to choose the right option. In this study, to consider economy of scale which exists in this industry, CRS is deployed [13].

D. Orientation  Lastly, orientation has to be chosen to running the program between input orientation and output orientation.

There is no specific methodology to choose because it depends on the nature of technology and the purpose of the decision makers. For the input-oriented model, the objective function is minimizing the investment or the input while the function variable level remains the same. In another word, using less input while getting the same output. However, the output-oriented model will increase the efficiency by maximizing the output while using the same level of input.

That means producing more output while not paying more money for the input [14]. For forecasting the DSLR cameras technology in this paper, Dynamic frontier year with output- orientation and CRS will be selected to observe the result.

However, more explanation will be described in the result section.

This study focuses exclusively on DSLR cameras excluding lens range from cropped sensor cameras such as Micro four-third, APS-C, and APS-H, to 35mm Full Frame cameras in the U.S. market. It does not include other types of digital cameras such as point and shoot, super zoom, mirror- less, and medium format cameras. The data is collected from several sources such as the manufacturer's official websites, digital photography reviews from www.dpreview.com, www.imaging-resource.com, and from www.dxomark.com.

In total, 115 DSLR cameras from 5 manufactures from 1999 to 2012 were used.  Table 1 below represents a sample of DSLR cameras data in semi-professional category sorted by year.

F. MSRP  There are two kinds of prices in DSLR camera market: the manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) and the street price. The MSRP is the price of a DSLR camera when it is  officially announced by its manufacturer. This study focuses on the MSRP of DSLR camera body only excluding lens in U.S dollar. From our observation, the trend of MSRP is different depending on the type of DSLR cameras. Fig. 5 illustrates the trend of MSRP of DSLR cameras of five manufacturers with respect to time.

G. Weight  Weight is used as one of the structural characteristics for a DSLR camera to deliver functions. In this study, we focus on the weight of DSLR camera body only excluding lens, battery, and memory cards, and it is measured in pound (lb).

Weights of DSLR cameras are different depending on the types of cameras. In general, the weights increase from entry to professional DSLR cameras. From our observation, the weight trend of each DSLR camera type is likely to be slowly decreasing. The Fig. 6 illustrates the trend of DSLR camera body weight with respect to time.

Fig. 5 MSRP ($) with respect to time     Fig. 6 Weight of DSLR camera body with respect to time   2013 Proceedings of PICMET '13: Technology Management for Emerging Technologies.

H. Resolution Resolution is one of the most important characteristics of  DSLR cameras and the first criteria that highly effects buyer's decision. Effective resolution represents the amount of details that a camera sensor can capture and it is measured in pixels.

DSLR cameras with higher effective resolution can capture more details which results in better image quality and makes it suitable for those landscape and studio photographers who need extremely high resolution for very large prints. In general, professional DSLR cameras especially the high-end flagship DSLR cameras, such as EOS 1Ds Mark III series from Canon and Nikon D3X, offer the highest pixel count than any type of the cameras in the same generation. From 1999 to 2012, the DSLR camera's resolutions have been increasing as the sensor technology developed. The Fig. 7 illustrates the improvement of effective resolution of DSLR cameras with respect to time.



I. Max FPS Max FPS stands for the maximum of frames per second  that a DSLR camera can shoot in high continues or burst mode. Max FPS is referred as the speed of DSLR cameras and it is a very important tool for sport photographers. DSLR cameras regularly provide different FPS depending on the type of the cameras.

J. Focus point  Number of focus points is also one of the most important characteristics of DSLR cameras, which determines the wideness of area coverage in a frame that a DSLR camera can focus.  The larger the number of focus points, the better and wider coverage that a camera can track and focus within a frame. Each type of DSLR cameras provides different metering and focusing systems which result in different numbers of focus points. Generally, number of focus points also distinguishes the type of DLSR cameras and the market.

IV. METHODOLOGY   A. TFDEA Procedure  To use TFDEA for technology foresight, we must first determine the time period of analysis; identify the main indicators of SOA (State Of Art) that characterize the products. Then, based on indicators, we should determine a TFDEA model type, collect data, and solve TFDEA model  with optimization software. Last, we need to analyze the results, validate the model, and draw forecasting chart for conclusions. This is done for each time period presented in the data set following the procedure.

B. Identify indicators  The output-oriented TFDEA model is illustrated in the flow chart presented as:     Fig. 10 Flow chart of TFDEA [14]  For	k 1,? , n, such that , ? 1.0 max? 	, ?  x , ? , x , , ?i ? 1,? ,m , ? , ? , , ? ? 1,? ,  ? 0 ? , 0, ? , 	 	 , ? , 0  s.t    ? ?k, such that ? 1, ? 1 Next k  Next   2013 Proceedings of PICMET '13: Technology Management for Emerging Technologies.

In the data, we included year, MSRP, weight, resolution, max FPS, and Focus Points as our main indicators. We choose output-oriented TFDEA model to calculate base on our project objective. The basic structural properties of DSLR camera are price, weight and size, which are selected as structural indicators. Resolution, max FPS, and Focus Point are selected as functional indicators.

Conceptually, TFDEA calls for testing each technology.

The technological rate of change, ?, for product k at any time, t, is represented by ?  [11]. Briefly, x ,  represents the ith input and y ,  represents the rth output of technology k. The variable ?  also serves as the objective function and represents the amount of additional output which should be achievable by technology k at time period t  if k were state- of-art at that time. The variables ? ,  describe how much of technology j is used in setting a target of performance for technology k. According to TFDEA method, the algorithm is shown as above in Fig. 10.

To predict the characteristics of DSLR camera technology in 2012 and beyond, we need the past technical characteristics of comparable DSLR camera. Thus we examined indicators for the data collected from the more than 100 DSLR to obtain the ideal result by trying on different types of inputs and outputs combination.



V. RESULTS   Table 2 illustrates the best-fit result of the model.

Dynamic frontier year is selected to use the effective date to define the second goal as maximum value. Output orientation model is used because DSLR trend tends to improve resolution and frame per second (FPS) more than weight and price. Therefore, finding how the output of the DSLR technology is increased at the same level of input is our goal.

CRS imply that outputs are increased in the same proportion inputs. The Average Rate of Change is shown at 1.244200, which means DSLR efficiency is improved around 24 percent every year. Frontier year at 2006 means the dataset is divided into before 2006, at 2006 and after 2006. MAD (Mean Absolute Deviation) is 1.767841, which means it could be 21 months error when this forecasting model is applied to the DSLR model. The second portion of the table illustrates that the model uses 2 inputs, MSRP and weight, and 3 outputs, resolution, Max FPS and FP, for forecasting DSLR technology. There are 50 cameras of the 115 analyzed that are State of Art (SOA) when they are released to the market and 10 cameras are still the SOA in 2006. 12 out of 50 state- of-art cameras are used to calculate the rate of change. 7 technologies are released before forecasted date, and 67 cameras are released after forecasted date.

TABLE 2 MODEL RESULT Frontier Type Orientation 2nd Goal Return to Scale Avg RoC Frontier Year MAD  Dynamic OO Max CRS 1.244200 2006 1.767841  Input(s) Output(s) SOA products at Release SOA products  on Frontier RoC  contributors Release before  forecast Release after  forecast 2 3 50 10 12 7 67     Fig. 11 Forecasting result at frontier year 2006   2013 Proceedings of PICMET '13: Technology Management for Emerging Technologies.

The Fig. 11 shows the result chart of DSLR technology at frontier year 2006 with 2 inputs and 3 outputs. From the chart, there are some technologies that are located on the diagonal line, which means it is perfect forecasting. However, most of the forecasted camera technologies are not located on the SOA line, which can be the mean absolute deviation error of 21 months.



VI. DISCUSSION  A. Effect of Market Segmentation  In the model and data section, the DSLR market can be divided into several market segmentations; professional, semi-professional, mid-range and entry market. And, in general, each market requires different characteristics. For example, in the professional DSLR market, photographers prefer higher performance and ruggedness, while entry level photographers want affordable price of cameras. Therefore, when a particular segment of dataset used in this research is analyzed with TFDEA, the result might show distinguishable characteristics of the market segments. The Fig. 12 and 13 show forecasting results of two ranges of datasets, professional and semi-professional markets. In here, in case of semi-professional cameras, the learning period is relatively shorter than the professional market. Therefore, considering enough the learning period, the frontier year is set to 2008 because the first camera in semi-professional market was released in 2002 while the first professional camera was released in 1999.

Fig. 12 Forecasting results of the professional market    Fig. 13 Forecasting results of the semi-professional market   In these two results, MAD is lower than the forecasting  results of all dataset without considering segmentation. This means smaller forecasting error and more accurate forecasting results. In addition, compared with all range market, the results in which market range is reflected have smaller differences between released date and forecasted date like the table 3.

As a result, considering market segmentation in TFDEA is reasonable to get more credible forecasting results. In other words, if distinct market segmentation exists such as this research, we need to use different inputs and outputs according to the circumstances.



VII. CONCLUSION   A. Limitation An analysis of validation of previous camera data to  forecast the camera technology in the future by including all the cameras in the market from professional to low-end cameras to the model seemed to be inapplicable with the result of high in standard deviation (MAD) since different camera market ranges result in different levels of camera technology. In case of the professional cameras which are considered to be the most versatile cameras to capture image in any light conditions, the lack of the usable ISO data as a functional characteristic to some of cameras is the missing measurement of camera efficiency and the result could be biased. The maximum ISO could be considered as an alternative output but it is left unused since it is not an accurate indicator of cameras to be considered high-ISO performers.

TABLE 3 COMPARISON OF MARKET SEGMENTATION  Model Market segment Released date Without segmentation With segmentation Forecasted Date Difference Forecasted Date Difference Canon Eos 1D X Professional 2012 2004.83 -7.17 2011.76 -0.24 Nikon D800 Semi-professional 2012 2009.68 -2.32 2012.45 +0.45     2013 Proceedings of PICMET '13: Technology Management for Emerging Technologies.

There are other several outputs that are interesting and should be included in the model since DSLR cameras are compelling than other types of camera but with the limitation of the model, only a maximum of 3 outputs can be applied.

With the time constraint, the DLSR cameras in mid-range and entry markets were left to be forecasted in this report.

Additionally, some MSRP in entry DSLR camera market can be considered invalid since they are sold with lens kit and there is no accurate MSRP of entry DSLR camera bodies only available which the result could be potentially inaccurate.

B. Future Work  Since DSLR cameras in mid-range and low-end markets were left and these two markets are considerably larger than semi-profession and professional camera markets, forecasting technology changes in these markets is interesting and should be considered to be a future work.

Different DSLR cameras markets have different technology priorities. For example, professional cameras are designed for those professional photographers who demand speed and versatility to capture images in any light conditions rather than resolution. Therefore, considering prioritizing the outputs with weights for each camera market can be a future work to improve the result.
