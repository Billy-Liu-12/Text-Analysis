MultiSOM: a multiview neural model for accurately analyzing   and mining complex data

Abstract In the procedure of information analysis, like in the domain of patent analysis, the complexity of the studied topics and the accuracy of the question to be answered may often lead the analyst to partition his reasoning into viewpoints. Most of the classical information analysis tools can only manage an analysis of the studied domain in a global way. The information analysis tool is considered in this paper is the MultiSOM tool, whose core model represents a significant extension of the classical Kohonen SOM neural model. The MultiSOM neural-based tool introduces the concepts of viewpoints and dynamics into the information analysis with its multi-maps displays and its inter-map communication process. The dynamic information exchange between maps can be exploited by an analyst in order to perform cooperative deduction between several different analyzes that have been performed on the same data. This paper demonstrates the efficiency of a viewpoint-oriented analysis as compared to a global analysis in the domain of patents. Both objective and subjective quality criteria are taken into account for quality evaluation.

Introduction  The digital maps are not only tools of visualization, but also represent important analytical tools. Appropriate display of cluster points can give the analyst an insight that it is impossible to get from reading tables of output or simple summary statistics. For some tasks, appropriate visualization is the only tool needed to solve a problem or confirm a hypothesis, even though we do not usually think of maps as a kind of analysis, as for patent analysis.

There is many ways to create digital maps. The one we consider here is based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). ANNs are a useful class of models consisting of layers of nodes. The power of ANNs is derived from their learning capability defined as a change in the weight matrix (W), which represents the strength of the  links among nodes. Moreover, both their relationships with multivariate data analysis and their non-linear capabilities represent added-values for clustering and mapping. The Kohonen self-organizing map (SOM) model is a specific kind of ANN which implements in only one step the tasks of clustering and mapping a data set. The SOM learning is a competitive and unsupervised process and the approach gives central attention to spatial order in the clustering of data. The purpose is to compress information by forming reduced representations of the most relevant features, without loss of information about their interrelationships. The main advantages of the SOM model are its robustness and its very good illustrative power. Conversely, the fact that original model is only able to deal with one clustering of the data at a time might be considered as a serious bottleneck for exploiting it for accurate mining tasks.

The MultiSOM model, which is presented in this paper, introduces the concepts of viewpoints and dynamics into information analysis with its multi-map displays and its inter-map communication mechanism.

The dynamic information exchange between maps can be exploited by an analyst in order to perform cooperative deduction between several different analyzes, combining clustering and mapping, that have been performed on the same data. This paper will mainly focuses on the study of the contribution of the viewpoint's oriented data analysis proposed by the MultiSOM model as compared to the global analysis proposed by the other models. An attempt will be made to define a protocol for performing such a comparison. The section 2 of the article presents the Kohonen self-organizing maps (SOM) and their main applications in mapping of science and technology. The section 3 deals with MultiSOM, the multi-map innovation of the SOM algorithm. The context of the experiment on the oil engineering patents and the preprocessing of these latter will be described in the section 4. The Section 5 describes the protocol of comparison which has been set up along with its results.

The section 6 presents an original attempt to extract implicit knowledge from the patents, like association rules, by the use of the MultiSOM inter-map communication mechanism in an automatic mode. The     conclusions are finally exposed. An additional annex provides an example of use of the MultiSOM model in an interactive mode by an information analyst.

2. The self-organizing map (SOM) model  The basic principle of the SOM is that our knowledge organization at higher levels is created during learning by algorithms that promote self-organization in a spatial order [5],[6],[7]. Thus, the architecture form of the SOM network is based on the understanding that the representation of data features might assume the form of a self-organizing feature map that is geometrically organized as a grid or lattice. The SOM algorithm takes thus a set of N-dimensional data as input and maps them onto nodes of a two-dimensional grid, resulting in an orderly feature map [7].

The SOM algorithm is presented in details in [7],[9],[15]. It consists of two basic procedures: (1) selecting a winning node and (2) updating codebook vector of the winning node and its neighboring nodes.

Once learning is achieved, the data can be affected to the nodes of the map. After the map building, the main characteristics of the clusters resulting from the topographical clustering process have to be highlighted to the analyst in order to provide him an overview (i.e. a global summary) of the analysis results. This task is difficult because the profiles of the obtained clusters are mostly complex weighted combination of indexes extracted from the data. A first set of solutions we have proposed for solving this problem, like cluster labeling and zoning strategies mechanisms, are presented in [10].

Fig. 4 of section 4 presents a map resulting from the combination of all the steps described above.

In the quantitative studies of science, the Kohonen self-organizing maps have been successfully used for mapping scientific journal networks [1], and also author co-citation data [25]. Maps have been also successfully used for several other applications in the general area of data analysis like for clustering meeting output, for clustering socio-economic data [24] and for documentary database contents mapping and browsing [9],[10]. Kaski et al. have implemented a specific adaptation of SOM, named WEBSOM, for the analysis of important document collections [6]. WEBSOM main characteristic is to include strategies for reducing the dimension of the entry data descriptions by using random projection techniques applied on word histograms extracted from the document contents. WEBSOM method has been tested for patents abstract analysis [7]. Nevertheless, as this method only manages such an analysis in a global way, it can only provide the analyst with general overview of the topics covered by the patents along with their interactions. A more exhaustive description of all the SOM applications might be found in [22].

3. The MultiSOM model  The communication between self-organizing maps has been firstly introduced in the context information  retrieval for analyzing the relevance user?s queries regarding the documentary database contents [9]. It represents a major amelioration of the basic Kohonen SOM model. From a practical point of view, the MultiSOM model introduces the use of viewpoints in the information analysis. The viewpoint building principle consists in separating the description space of the data into different subspaces corresponding to different criteria of analysis. The set of V all possible viewpoints issued from the description space D of a dataset can be defined as:  V = {v1, v2, ?, vn}, vi  P(D)  where each vi represents a viewpoint and P(D) represents the set of the parts of the description space of the data D.

Three main remarks follow the above definition: (1) the viewpoint subsets issued from V may overlap one to another; (2) the union of the different viewpoints can be viewed as the overall description space of the data; (3) the most suitable basis an for homogeneous management of the viewpoints is a vectorial description space.

As an example, an image can be simultaneously described using 3 different viewpoints represented by: (1) a keyword vector; (2) color histogram vector; (3) a feature vector.

The principle of the MultiSOM model is to be constituted by several SOM maps that have been generated from the same data. Each map is itself issued from a specific viewpoint. The relation between maps is established through the use of two main mechanisms: the inter-map communication mechanism and the generalization mechanism.

The inter-map communication mechanism enables to highlight semantic relationships between different topics (i.e. clusters) belonging to different viewpoints related to the same data. In MultiSOM, this communication is based on the use of the data that have been projected onto each map as intermediary nodes or activity transmitters between maps (see Fig. 1).

Source signal: direct user activation or query matching activation  [1]  [2] [3]  Source signal: direct user activation or query matching activation  [1]  [2] [3]Source Map  Target Map  Figure 1: Inter-map communication principle  The inter-map communication is established by standard Bayesian inference network propagation algorithm which is used to compute the posterior probabilities of target map's node Tk which inherited of the activity (evidence Q) transmitted by its associated     data nodes. This computation can be carried out efficiently because of the specific Bayesian inference network topology that can be associated to the MultiSOM model. Hence, it is possible to compute the probability P(acmt|Tk,Q) for an activity of modality actm on the map node Tk which is inherited from activities generated on the source map. This computation is achieved as follows [13]:  k  km  Td d  Tactd d km SdSim  SdSim QTactP  ),(  ),( ),( ,  such that Sd is the source node to which the data d has been associated, Sim(d, Sd) is the cosine correlation measure between the codebook vector of the data d and the one of its source node Sd and d actm,Tk if it has been activated with the modality actm from the source map.

The main objective of the generalization mechanism is to summarize the contents of a basic map into more generic topics (see Fig. 2).

Figure 2: Generalization principle  Let n ? m, (n, m 2) be the dimension of the map associated to a given level, the above described generalization process will then produce a next more general level in the form of a (n 1)?(m 1) map, with:  Mnk  k  Vn  M n  M  n WW 4  where VnM represents the square neighbourhood set on the map M associated to the neuron n of the new synthetic map M + 1.

Existing clustering algorithm, such as growing hierarchical self-organizing map (GHSOM) [16], represents a dynamically growing architecture which evolves into a descending hierarchical structure of SOM.

Nevertheless, the weak point of this method is to isolate lower level maps without regards to their potential links.

As opposed, our generalization method has the advantage of preserving the original neighbourhood structure on the new generated levels. Moreover, it ensures the conservation of topographic properties of the map neuron codebook vectors [10]. It could be also considered as an implicit and distributed form of a hierarchical classification method based on  neighbourhood reciprocity [14]. Finally, there is a straightforward relationship between the generalization and the inter-map communication mechanism. Therefore, the inter-map communication could be used between map/gas and its generalizations in so far as they share the same projected data.

4. Application  In the two preceding sections we have introduced the MultiSOM model after having previously presented the SOM model. In this section, we shall then use a real example, to make some of the notions more concrete. We argue that visualization into form of a set of maps represents an important added-value for analysis in the technology watching tasks, as well as in science watch, and in knowledge discovery in databases. Our example is a set of 1000 patents about oil engineering technology recorded during the year 1999.

4.1 The analysis phase  The role of the MultiSOM application has been firstly planed by the domain expert in order to get answers to such various kinds of questions on the patents that:  Node of synthesis of level M +1  1: ?Which are the relationships between the patentees?? 2: ?Which are the advantages of the different oils??, 3: ?Does a patentee works on a specific engineering technology, for which advantage and for which use??,  Nodes of level M  4: ?Which is the technology that is used by a given patentee without being used by another one??, 5: ?Which are the main advantages of a specific oil component and do this advantages have been mentioned in all the patents using this component??.

An analysis carried out on all the possible types of question led the expert to define different viewpoints on the patents that could be associated to different closed semantic domains appearing in these questions. One of the main aim of the expert was to be able to use each viewpoints separately in order to get answers to domain closed questions (like questions 1,2) while maintaining the possibility of a multi-viewpoint communication in order to get answers to multi-domain questions (like questions 3,4,5) that might also contain negation (like question 4). The specific viewpoints which have been highlighted by the expert from the set of possible questions are: 1: Patentees, 2: Title (often contains information on the specific components used in the patent), 3: Use, 4: Advantages.

A fifth ?global viewpoint? which represent the combination of all the specific ones is also considered in order to perform our comparison between a global clustering mechanism, of the WEBSOM type, and a pure     viewpoint-oriented clustering mechanism, of the MultiSOM type.

4.2 The technical realization  The role of this phase consists in mapping the four specific viewpoints highlighted by the domain expert in the preceding phase in four different maps. A preliminary task consists in obtaining the index set (i.e.

the vocabulary set) associated to each viewpoint from the full text of the patents. This task has been itself divided into three elementary steps. At the step 1, the structure of the patent abstracts is parsed in order to extract the subfields corresponding to the Use and to the Advantages viewpoints1. At the step 2, the rough index set of each subfield is constructed by the use of a basic computer-based indexing tool [3]. This tool extracts terms and noun phrases from the subfield content according to a normalized terminology and its syntactical variations. It eliminates as well usual language templates.

At the step 3, the normalization of the rough index set associated to each viewpoint is performed by the domain expert in order to obtain the final index sets. Fig. 3 presents a patent abstract including its generated multi- index.

The following task consists in building the maps representing the different viewpoints, using the algorithm described in section 2. Before these step, a classical IDF-Normalization step [19] is applied to the index vectors associated to the patents in order to reduce the influence of the most widespread terms of the indexes.

For each specific viewpoint a map of 10x10 nodes (clusters) is finally generated. Two global maps representing global unsupervised patents clustering, of the WEBSOM type [8], are also constructed. The index sets of these maps represent the union of the index sets of all the specific viewpoints. They only differ one to another by the number of their nodes. The first one (GlobMin) is constrained to have the same number of nodes as the viewpoint maps (i.e. 100 nodes). The second one (GlobMax) is constrained to have to sum of the number of nodes of all the viewpoint maps (i.e. it becomes a 20x20 map comprising 400 nodes).

Table 1 summarizes the results of the patent indexation and the map building. A single viewpoint map resulting from the whole map building process is presented at Fig. 4.

4.3 Inter-map communication for analysis  In comparison with the standard mapping methods, as such as principal component analysis, multidimensional scaling or WEBSOM global SOM analysis, the advantage of the multi-map displays is the inter-map communication mechanism that MultiSOM environment provides to user. Each map is representing a viewpoint.

1 The Patentees and Title subfields are directly represented in the original patent structure and therefore do not necessitate any extraction.

Each viewpoint is representing a subject category. The inter-map communication mechanism assisted the user to cross information between the different viewpoints. In both cases, the responses of the system are given both through activity profiles on the maps and through patents examples associated to the most active nodes (i.e. topics) representatives of these maps. The estimation of the quality of thematic deduction is achieved through an evaluation of the activity focalization on the target maps (see[9]). Fig. 5 illustrates a thematic deduction between the four different viewpoints of the study.

5. Evaluation  The advantages of the MultiSOM method seem obvious to the expert of the domain: the original multiple viewpoints clustering approach of MultiSOM tends to reduce the noise which is inevitably generated in an overall clustering approach while increasing the flexibility and the granularity of the analyses. Moreover, with a global clustering method, like WEBSOM, important relationships between some subtopics are hidden in the cluster profiles and therefore very difficult to precisely characterize. The expert found more than 35 of such important relationships by the use of the MultiSOM method. A simple example is given by the comparison of Fig. 4 and Fig. 6. Other examples of more elaborated topic relationships that can be only obtained by the MultiSOM inter-map communication mechanism are given in the annex of the paper. Finally, the expert argued that the possibility of interactively activating, positively or negatively, the nodes (i.e. the topics) on the maps represents a great help for tuning very precisely an analysis process. Nevertheless, expert empirical evaluation remains insufficient to objectively compare global approach to viewpoint-oriented approach. For this last purpose, we propose new objective clustering quality estimators for both evaluating and optimising the results of the clustering and of the mapping methods, especially when they are applied in the domain of documentary databases. These estimators are more precisely described in the next section.

5.1 Evaluation procedure  When anyone aims at comparing clustering methods, he will be faced with the problem of choice of reliable clustering quality measures. The classical evaluation measures for the quality of a clustering are based on the intra-cluster inertia and the inter-cluster inertia [12], [14], [18]. Thanks to these two measures, a clustering result is considered as good if it possesses low intra-cluster inertia as compared to its inter-cluster inertia. However, in the case of a Kohonen clustering, as well as for many other numerical clustering methods, these measures are often strongly biased, mainly because the intrinsic dimensions of the clusters profiles (number of non-zero components in the codebook vectors describing the clusters) are not of the same order of magnitude than the     intrinsic dimensions of the data profiles2. It is especially true in the documentary domain where the number of indexes in the documents is extremely low as compared to the dimension of their overall description space.

A promising way we have found to more precisely highlight the main characteristics of the clusters of the map and to validate the thematic deductions between the maps consists in coupling the MultiSOM model with a symbolic model using Galois lattice conceptual clustering of the patents regarding the same viewpoints as the one used for the map building. This approach is extensively described in [23]. A Galois lattice model can also be considered as a pure natural elementary classifier.

Indeed, it groups the data by directly considering their intrinsic properties (i.e. without any preliminary construction of clusters profiles). Hence, one might derive from its behavior news cluster quality evaluation factors which can be substituted to the measures of inertia for validating the intrinsic properties of the numerical clusters. For the sake of user-orientation, our proposed measures are based in a parallel way on the recall and precision criteria which are extensively used from evaluating the result quality of information retrieval (IR) systems. In IR, the Recall R represents the ratio between the number of relevant documents which have been returned by an IR system for a given query and the total number of relevant documents which should have been found in the documentary database [20]. The Precision P represents the ratio between the number of relevant documents which have been returned by an IR system for a given query and the total number of documents returned for the said query. Recall and Precision generally behave in an antagonist way: as Recall increases, Precision decreases, and conversely.

The F function has thus been proposed in order to highlight the best compromise between these two values [26]. It is given by:  PR PRF *2  (Eq. 1)  Based on the same principles, the Recall and Precision measures which we introduce hereafter evaluate the quality of a clustering method by measuring the relevance of the cluster content3 in terms of shared properties. In our further descriptions, the cluster content is supposed to be represented by documents and the indexes (i.e. the properties) of the documents are supposed to be weighted by values within the range 1,0 .

Let us consider a set of clusters C resulting from a clustering method applied on a set of documents D, the local Recall (Rec) and Precision (Prec) measures for a given property p of the cluster c are expressed as:  2 In the SOM method, a second bias is generated by the cluster construction process that tends to maintain the topographic properties of the map by enhancing the similarities between neighboring clusters.

3 The content of a cluster is represented by the subset of original data that have been associated to it by the clustering process.

*  *  )(Rec p  p  c C  c p ,  c c  p p c  *  )(Prec  Then, the averaged Recall (R) and Precision (P) measures for the overall clustering can be expressed as:  cSp c  Cc c  pSC R )(Rec11 ,  cSp c  Cc c  pSC P )(Prec11  where Sc is the set of properties which are peculiar to the cluster c that is described as:  Cc  pp cc WMaxWcddpS c  ' ',  where C represents the peculiar set of clusters extracted from the clusters of C, which verifies:  cSCcC and:  Cc cd  p d  cd  p d  p c  W  W W  ' '  where  represents the weight of the property p for element x.

p xW  Similarly to IR, the F-measure (described by Eq. 1) could be used to combine averaged Recall and Precision results. Moreover, we have demonstrated in [12] that if both values of averaged Recall and Precision reach the unity value, the peculiar set of clusters C represents a Galois lattice. Therefore, the combination of this two measures enables to evaluate to what extent a numerical clustering model can be assimilated to a Galois lattice natural classifier. The stability of our Quality criteria has also been demonstrated in [13].

5.2 Evaluation results  The examination of the Quality measures of the table 2 gives more reliable and stable results because these measures are both independent of the clustering method and of the size of the description space. It highlights the overall superiority of the viewpoint-oriented approach as compared with a global approach with the same number of clusters (GlobMin).

As soon as the number of clusters is strongly increased in the global approach (GlobMax), its quality is simultaneously increased, but the advantage of the viewpoint-oriented approach remains obvious in the average (higher Average F-value on all viewpoints than F-value of GlobMax), with a more reasonable number of nodes (i.e. clusters) per maps from a user point of view.

The specific case of the Title clustering should be discussed here. The bad quality of this clustering is both     due to the index sparseness of this field4 and to an inappropriate number of clusters, relatively to the size of its associated description space. An interesting strategy would then be to make use of the quality factor Q in order to find the optimal number of clusters for this clustering. An unbalance between averaged Recall and Precision (in the favour of averaged Recall) can be observed in the case of the worse clustering (GlobMin and Titles). Such an unbalance means that documents with different properties sets are grouped in the same clusters, leading conjointly to the risk of confusion in the interpretation of the content of the clusters by the user.

The quality analysis clearly shows that the viewpoint-oriented approach enhance the quality of interpretation of a clustering by both reducing the number of cluster to be consulted by the user on each viewpoint and providing him with more coherent and exhaustive clusters in terms of content.

5.3 Optimisation of clustering results  The quality criteria that have been presented in the latter section can also be used for optimizing the number of clusters for each viewpoint map. The goal of this process is to provide the analyst with an optimal quality of interpretation for each individual map associated to a specific viewpoint. For that purpose, different maps are generated from 6x6 to 24*24 nodes (clusters) for each viewpoint. The principle of our algorithm of clustering optimisation, which is described in [12], is to search for a break-even point (i.e. intersection point) between averaged Recall and Precision. The map whose quality criteria stand the nearest from the break-even point is considered as the optimal one. Fig. 7 subjectively illustrates the difference of accuracy that can be obtained in the analysis by optimizing the map size for a given viewpoint. As it is shown in this figure, high quality maps are usually characterized by more precise topic labels and smaller average size of their logical areas.

6. Mining knowledge with MultiSOM  6.1 Principles  Data mining or knowledge discovery in database (KDD) refers to the non-trivial process of discovering interesting, implicit, and previously unknown knowledge from large databases. Such a task implies to be able to perform analyses on high-dimensional input data. The most popular models used in KDD are the symbolic models. The symbolic approach to Database Contents Analysis is mostly based on the Galois lattice model (see [2]). A Galois lattice, L(D,P), is a conceptual hierarchy built up on a set of data D which are described by a set of properties P also called the intention (Intent) of the concept of the lattice. A class of the hierarchy, also  4 This can be ?a posteriori? confirmed by the inertia results for this viewpoint.

called "formal concept", is defined as a pair C=(d,p) where d denotes the extension (Extent) of the concept, i.e. a subset of D, and p denotes the intention of the concept, i.e. a subset of P. The lattice structure implies that it exists a partial order on a lattice such that:  C1, C2 L, C1 C2  Extent(C1)  Extent(C2) Intent(C1) Intent(C2)  Association rules are one of the basic types of knowledge extraction from large databases. Given a database, the problem of mining association rules consists in generating all association rules that have certain user-specified minimum support and confidence.

An association rule is an expression A B where A and B are conjunctions of properties. It means that if an individual data possesses all the properties of A then he necessarily possesses all the properties of B. The support of the rule is supp(A B), and the confidence: Conf = supp(A B)/supp(A). An approach proposed by [21] shows that a subset of association rules can be obtained following the direct links of heritage between the concepts in the Galois lattice. Unfortunately, symbolic models suffer of very serious limitations. Rule generation is a highly time-consuming process that generates a huge number of rules, including a large ratio of redundant rules. Hence, this prohibits any kind of rule computation and selection as soon as data are numerous and they are represented by very high-dimensional description space. This latter situation is very often encountered with documentary data. To cope with these problems, preliminary KDD trials using numerical models have been made. An algorithm for knowledge extraction from self-organizing network is proposed in .

This approach is based on a supervised generalized relevance learning vector quantization (GRLVQ) which is used for extracting decision trees. The different paths of the generated trees are then used for denoting rules.

Nevertheless, the main defect of this method is to necessitate training data. An elaborated unsupervised neural model, like MultiSOM, represents a natural candidate to cope with the related problems of rule inflation and rule selection that are inherent to symbolic methods. Hence, its synthesis capabilities that can be used both for reducing the number of rules and for extracting the most significant ones. In this last section we propose a new approach for knowledge extraction that consists in using our MultiSOM model as a front- end for unsupervised extraction of association rules. This approach will both exploit the inter-map communication mechanism of the model and the recall and precision measures that have been described in the latter sections.

The general form of the extraction algorithm A between two viewpoints v1 and v2 follows:  p1 Pc*, p2 Pc`* and c v1, c` v2 1) If (Rec(p1) = Rec( p2) = Prec(p1) = Prec(p2) = 1) Then Test_Rule_Type; 2) ElseIf (Rec(p1) = Rec(p2) = Prec(p2) = 1) Then Test_Rule_Type;     3) ElseIf (Rec(p1) = Rec( p2) = Prec(p1) = 1) Then Test_Rule_Type; 4) ElseIf (Rec(p1) = Rec(p2) = 1) Then Test_Rule_Type;  where Test_Rule_Type procedure is expressed as: If (Extentv1(p1)  Extentv2(p2)) Then: p1 p2 If (Extentv2(p2)  Extentv1(p1)) Then: p2 p1 If (Extentv1(p1)  Extentv2(p2)) Then: p1 p2  Optional steps: Extended rules a p1 Pc*, p2 Pc`: Substituting respectively Rec(p2) and Prec(p2) by the viewpoint-based measures Recv1(p2) and Precv1(p2), related to the source viewpoint, in the previous algorithm.

b p1 Pc, p2 Pc`*: Substituting respectively Rec(p1) and Prec(p1) by the viewpoint-based measures Recv2(p1) and Precv2(p1), related to the destination viewpoint, in the previous algorithm.

6.2 Mining experiment and results  The two viewpoints, Advantages and Use, will be considered in our experiment. In this experiment, original maps of 256 (optimal) and 225 (optimal) neurons for Advantages and Use viewpoints, respectively, are generated. The experiment consists in extracting rules using the extraction algorithmm A in combination with the inter-map communication mechanism between the Advantages and the Use viewpoints. The communication is achieved between the original maps of each viewpoint, and furthermore, between the same levels of generalization of each considered viewpoint. For each single communication step, the extraction algorithm is applied is a bidirectional way. Some examples of extracted rules are given hereafter: R1: Natural oil (Advantages)  Catapult oil (Use) (supp = 2, conf = 100%) R2: Natural oil (Advantages) Drilling fluid (Use) (supp = 2, conf = 100%)  As well as overall inter-map communication process map gives a global view of related topics described in the patents, such inter-map generated association rules more accurately highlight precise relationships and dependencies between concepts of patents domain.

A global summary of the results of the association rule extraction experiment is given in table 3. The table includes a comparison of our extraction algorithm with a standard symbolic rule extraction method as regards to the amount of extracted rules. When our extraction algorithm is used with its optional steps, it is able to extract almost the same number of rules as a classical symbolic model that basically uses a combinatory approach. Indeed, table 3 shows that 601 rules of confidence 100% (among 649 possible rules) are extracted. Even if, in this case, no rule selection is performed, the main advantage of this version of the  algorithm, as compared to a classical symbolic method, is the computation time. Indeed, as soon as our algorithm is cluster-based, the computation time is significantly reduced. Another interesting result is the behaviour of our extraction algorithm when it is used in its standard version (without its optional steps). In this case, a rule selection process is performed (see table 3).

The table presents a basic comparison between the standard symbolic rule extraction method and the MultiSOM based rule extraction method. The global rule count defined for the symbolic model includes the count of partial rules (confidence<100%) and the count of total rules (confidence=100%). The peculiar rule count is the count of rules obtained with the standard versions of the extraction algorithms. The extended rule count is the count of rules obtained with the extended version of the extraction algorithm including its optional steps.

7. Conclusion  We have presented a new self-organizing multi-map system called MultiSOM. We proposed it as a visualization-based system for scientific and technical information analysis, like patents analysis. The model that this multi-map environment provides is certainly not the map but in its original extended version of intercommunication between multiples maps. Each map representing a particular viewpoint extracted from the data. Moreover, the viewpoints used in a given analysis can be easily adapted to the problem to be solved. We have exposed both the map generation and their intercommunication mechanism. We finally showed how one can evaluate such a viewpoint-oriented approach by comparing it to a global clustering approach.

The advantages of the MultiSOM model for patents analysis seem obvious both in terms of objective evaluation, like the one we proposed, and for the domain experts: the original multiple viewpoints clustering approach of MultiSOM tends to reduce the noise which is inevitably generated in an overall clustering approach while increasing the flexibility and the granularity of the analyses. Moreover, with a global clustering method, even if this latter manages overlapping clusters, important relationships between some subtopics are hidden in the cluster profiles and therefore very difficult to precisely characterize.

Our experiment has also highlighted that the quality evaluation factors we have proposed can be used for     optimizing the clustering in terms of number of clusters, either this clustering is global or it is viewpoint-oriented.

Finally, we have proposed a new approach for knowledge extraction that takes benefit of the MultiSOM environment. In the patents analysis domain, such knowledge extraction capability is mandatory to mine precise information from patents. Our approach makes uses of the MultiSOM inter-map communication mechanism in combination with original measures of recall and precision for extracting rules from maps. Even if complementary experiments must be done, our first results are very promising. They tend to prove that the MultiSOM model represents a natural candidate to cope with the related problems of rule inflation, rule selection and computation time that are inherent to symbolic models.
