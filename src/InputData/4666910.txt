Constructing tourism association words set based on association rule mining

Abstract   It is difficult for traditional data mining algorithms to mine semantic information from text set because of its complexity and high dimension. To solve this problem, the semantic categories of words appearing in tourism emergency reports are studied, and a semantic association rule mining algorithm is presented based on these categories. Association words are also gained from these rules, which can better describe the semantic contents of the texts. Quantum-inspired genetic algorithm is utilized to improve the effectiveness of rule-searching process. Experiments show the better results than traditional methods.

1. Introduction   As tourism is developing rapidly in our country, the  load of service facilities is growing too and tourism emergencies happened frequently. Therefore, it is very necessary for us to gain tourism emergency information and analyze its patterns [1]. It is also an important basis of making decision and management. However, tourism emergency is a special concept, which is difficult to be described as a few topic words, so keyword based web searching algorithm can?t be used directly[2]. We need a method to find semantic features of different kinds of tourism emergency information. An semantic association rule mining algorithm based on word?s category is presented in this paper, which is used to find semantic relationships of characteristic words, which belong to five categories: object, environment, activity, event and result.

To achieve a better performance and accuracy, quantum- inspired genetic algorithm is introduced into rule- searching process[3]. By using qubit coding and quantum gate transformation, the population of candidate rules is enlarged and the diversity of solutions is also ensured.

2. Semantic Association Rules of Tourism  Emergency Information   Tourism Emergencies include many different types of events, such as traffic accident, security accident, and natural disaster and so on. Usually they are reported using different characteristic words, so it is difficult to describe them as a common keyword. By analyzing the reports, these words usually can be classified into five sets: object, environment, activity, event and result, which describe the contents of tourism emergencies from different aspects. In this paper, characteristic words are extracted from training text set and classified into five word sets as in table 1.

Table 1. Category of characteristic words  Category Num. of Words Num. of Concepts Description  object 123 51 Objects involved in the emergencies, such as ?tourist?, ?vehicle?.

environment 133 62  Geography or natural environment where the emergencies happened, such as ?strong wind?, ?heavy rain?.

activity 56 38 Activities of the objects, suchas ?tour?, ?taking photos?.

event 209 146 Words which describe the emergency events, such as ?drowning?.

result 41 27 The results of the events, suchas ?injured?, ?dead?.

In order to reduce the number of characteristic words, similar words in each word set are represented by a concept (sememe). Word similarity is calculated based on Hownet[4]. For two Chinese words w1 and w2, if w1 has n concepts (sememes): s11, s12? s1n , and w2 has m concepts: s21, s22?s2m, the similarity between w1 and w2 is defined as maximal sememe similarity [5] :  1 2 1 21... , 1...

( , ) max ( , )i ji n j mSim w w Sim s s= ==  (1)  The similarity between two concepts is defined as follows:  1 2( , )S im s s d ?  ? =  + (2) This work is supported by National Natural Science Foundation  of China (No. 60773112) and Beijing Natural Science Foundation (No.4082021, No.4072018)   DOI    DOI    DOI 10.1109/ICNC.2008.645    DOI 10.1109/ICNC.2008.645     where d is the distance between s1 and s2 in hierarchy of Hownet, ? is an adjustable parameter.

Mining association rules of the characteristic words in these five sets is useful to find their semantic relationships [6]. To avoid items appearing in association rules belong to a same category, association rules based on semantic categories is defined. We use W to denote the set of characteristic words, W = {w1, w2, ? , wn}, in which each word wi belongs to a category Kwi, and Ti to denote the feature of text i. If the word appearing in text i is similar to a characteristic word wj, the characteristic word will be entered into Ti, so iT W? . D is denoted as the database of texts, D={T1, T2, ? , Tm}.

Define A ? B as a semantic association rule based on category, where , ,A W B W A B? ? ? = ? , and for any two item u, v in A and B,  u vK K? . For database D, we use s to denote the support of rule A ? B:  s = P(A? B)    (3) And c to denote confidence of the rule: c = P(B|A).    (4) According to this definition, semantic association rule  based on category is better than traditional one which has same confidence. For example, rule 1 ( {vehicle, reverse} => tourism traffic accident ) is better than rule 2  ( { tourist, vehicle} => tourism traffic accident ). Because ?vehicle? and ?reverse? belong to different semantic categories which include more semantic contents, but ?tourist?? and ?vehicle? both belong to ?object? category with less information.

The association rules mining is also a search process [7]: data set is the search space, algorithm is the search policy. Quantum-inspired genetic algorithm (QGA) is a remarkable research area in recent years, and it is fit for solving search and optimization problems. In QGA, qubits are used to encode chromosomes, thus a more abundant population is obtained. Moreover, quantum transformation can easily make use of the best individual?s information to control the variation of Q-chromosome, and make the population evolve towards the direction of excellent patterns.

3. Association Rules Mining Based on Quantum-inspired genetic algorithm   In Quantum-inspired genetic algorithm (QGA), a m- qubits chromosome can be defined as:  1 2  1 2  m  m  ?? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?    where ? , ?  represent the probability amplitudes of the corresponding state, and 2? , 2? give the probability respectively that the qubit will be found in ?0? state or in  ?1? state, 2 2 1 i i  ? ?+ = , i = 1,?,m. The definition can represents any linear superposition of the states.

When generating the Q-chromosome of a candidate association rule (A ? B), encode each item in it as a qubit. If the observation state of a qubit is ?1?, that means the corresponding item will appear in the rule. The population of QGA is composed of Q-chromosomes, and the generation t, Q(t), is defined as  { }1 2, , ,t t tnq q q? , where n is the population size; m is the length of chromosome; tiq  is an individual chromosome in the population:  1 2  1 2  t t t i i imt  i t t t i i im  q ? ? ? ? ? ?  ? ? = ? ? ? ?? ?  ?    i = 1,2,?,n  We use the following evolution procedure to obtain valid association rules: (1)Initialization  Determine the size of population and number of qubits, and construct the initial population Q = { }1 2, , , nq q q? , where the  probability amplitudes of all qubits are set to 1 2 , that means there are the same probabilities of superposition at the beginning of evolution.

(2) Generate Observation State P(t)  Create observation state P(t) for the population Q(t) from probability amplitudes of each individual in it:  { }1 2( ) , , ,t t tnP t p p p= , where tip  ( i = 1 ,2 , ?, n) is the observation state of each individual, it is a m-bits binary group. The method of generating P(t) is as follows:  For each qubit t ij t ij  ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?? ?  of tiq , generate a random  number r, r?[0,1]. If r <  i ? , the corresponding  observation value is ?0?, otherwise it is ?1?.

(3) Calculate Fitness  Calculate individual?s fitness f from its observation state:  f (A?B) = s(A?B) + c(A?B)  (5) Thus we can evaluate the rule?s match with data set  and get better individuals from the evaluation. During the evolution period, individual relies on its own fitness to compete with others. And individuals which fulfill the definition of semantic association rule based on category will have more chances to live.

(4) Selection  Select the best l individuals from current generation according to fitness. Then compare them with the best ones from last generation and retain the better l individuals to consist of best solution set. At that time, if stop condition is met, the algorithm terminates; otherwise, go to next step.

(5) Variation of Q(t) Apply quantum gate transformation to individuals of  Q(t) and get new population Q(t+1). The quantum rotation gate G is applied [8].

cos( ) sin( ) ( )  sin( ) cos( ) G  ? ? ?  ? ? ?? ?  = ? ? ? ?  (6)  where ? is the rotation angle: ? = k ? h (?, ?)     (7) k is a coefficient related to convergence, and it is 0.02?  here. h (?, ?) is a direction function pointing to the direction of the best solution. Table 2 shows the value of the direction function. In this table, pij is the j-th bit of current individual?s observation state pi . bkj is the j-th bit of the best individual bk?s observation state. bk is randomly selected from best solution set. f is the fitness function, and ?ij, ?ij are probability amplitudes of current individual.

Table 2. Value of h(?, ?)  pij bkj f (pi)>f (b) h (?ij , ?ij)  ?ij = 0 ?ij =0 ?ij ? ?ij >0 ?ij ? ?ij <0 0 0 false 0 0 0 0 0 0 true 0 0 0 0 0 1 false 0 0 0 0 0 1 true ?1 0 -1 +1 1 0 false ?1 0 -1 +1 1 0 true 0 ?1 +1 +1 1 1 false 0 ?1 +1 -1 1 1 true 0 ?1 +1 -1   By applying quantum rotation gate to each individual?s  probability amplitudes, we can get a new population Q(t+1) from Q(t), as follows:  1 ( )t ti iq G t q + = ?     (8)  Where G(t) is the rotation gate of the generation t, and t iq ,  1t iq +  are respectively the probability amplitudes of  each individual in generation t and t+1. The transformation allows a shift of each qubit in the direction of the corresponding bit value in the best solution. Thus, there is a great probability that the population will evolve towards multi optimal patterns with higher fitness.

(6) Migration  After g generations, a migration is performed. Firstly, generate a new population as initialization step. Then, choose some qubits randomly from the best individual of this population to substitute the best individual?s of former population. In such way, a global optimal solution might be found.

(7) Count of generations increased, then go to step 2.

4. Experiment Results   In our experiments, the text set of tourism emergencies is divided into training set and testing set. According to the type of emergency, the training set iss divided into  four groups. Characteristic words are extracted from the training set. We applied the proposed algorithm to mine rules on training set, then to predict on the testing set and compute the correctness.

Table 3 gives the results: the extraction rate (number of effective rules/ total number of mined rules) and the correctness. The results from classical method with genetic algorithm are also shown in table 3 for comparison. The results show that the algorithm presented in this paper can get semantic rules effectively with higher extraction rate and correctness. In an association rule with high confidence, the words appearing in it described the concepts of this type of emergency events. So several small association words sets are gained from these rules, and are used to search for tourism emergency reports.

Some searching results are also shown in table 4. The results show that these association words can better describe the semantic contents of these events.

Results of web searching using association words sets  Association words set Num. of searching results correctness  { tourist, drowning} 110 0.96 { tourist, surrounded} 369 0.95  {tourist, get lost} 134 0.86 { tourist, failure, wounded} 26 0.73   5. Conclusion  In this paper, a new algorithm for mining semantic association rules is proposed, which introduces quantum- inspired genetic algorithm into data mining. This algorithm divides characteristic words into several categories according to their semantic and tries to find association rules between them. QGA is used to search rules by coding the candidate rules to quantum-inspired chromosomes. Inducted by the best solution set, the population evolves towards multi-objective directions.

Different types of association rules can be found. The experiments demonstrate that the semantic association rule mining based on category can obtain better results from complex text set of tourism emergences. Association words can also be gained from the rules for web searching or information extraction.
