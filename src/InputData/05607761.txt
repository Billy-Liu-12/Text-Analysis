I. INTRODUCTION  Dynamic light scattering (DLS) is a powerful technique for the sizing of nanoparticles and characterization of their properties in the liquid phase [1-3]. It often gets the particles sizes distribution( PSD) by measuring the ACF of scattered light intensity. In DLS experiment, the procedures are rigidly performed by using calibrated samples of latex spheres of different diameters. Although this procedure is well established, it presents several limitations and may lead to wrong or unclear results. To obtain the DLS signal with no noise, the computer simulation is more flexible, more convenient and faster method. DLS signal simulation method of wavelet transform presented by this paper's author is a feasible and powerful method However, Influence of parameters of this method on simulation isn't analyzed. In this paper, Influence of simulation parameters such as decomposition scale data length and sample frequency on simulation will be discussed.



II. DYNAMIC LIGHT SCATTERING SIGNAL SIMULATION METHOD PRINCIPLE OF WAVELET TRANSFORM  If the light field is a Gauss distribution, the light intensity fluctuation is expressed as x(t). x(t) is a random process with zero average, which relates to the particles size. The power spectrum of x(t) is expressed as [4]  (1)  YANGHui College of Optics and Electronic Information Engineering  Shanghai Universityof Science and Technology Shanghai,China  yanghui313@126.com  where r relates to particle size and is called decay linewidth, OJ is angular frequency.

The relations of decay linewidth and the particles size is expressed as [5]  2 4mz .  e k8T r=Dq , q= - sm(-),D= -- (2) A 2 37r17d  where d is the radius of the particles, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin degrees, 11 is the viscosity of the solvent, A is the wavelength of the incident light in vacuum, n is the refractive index of the solvent and e is scattering angle.

According to wavelet transform multi-resolution Principle[6], continuous function x(t) can be expressed as  J x(t) = L Ldj,klf/j,k(t) + LCj,k?j,k(t) (3) j=! k=-? k=-? Where ?j,k (t) is scale function, Iffj,k (t) is the  orthogonal wavelet basis function, C and d are the approximate coefficient and the detail coefficient respectively. When J ? 00, x(t) can only be expressed by the details part. Its inverse transformation is as follows  x(t) = L d j,klf/ j,k (t) (4) j,k According to Parseval theorem, for orthogonal wavelet  transform, At j scale, signal energy of time domain should be equal to signal energy of this frequency band. The signal energy of j scale can be expressed as  E. = " d2 = rfi P(f)df J L..J J ,k Jljl? k 2  (5)  According to multi-resolution ideas, when the sampling frequency is h ' as decomposition scale increase, signal is be successively composed approximation signal and the detail signals with different frequency range [fs/4,fs/2] , [fs/8,h./4] , ... . When decomposition scale reach J ? 00. Signal x(t) can be composed by the detail signals of all scale space and      approximation signal of most rough scale space. For stationary random signal x(t) , the average is zero, when J is enough large, the approximation signal of J scales tends to zero. Therefore, the signal x(t) can be approximately expressed as  .J  x(t) = L L d. k \jf . k (t) (6) }, }, }=1 k=-= For the light field of Gauss distribution, random  fluctuations light intensity x(t) is the stationary random Gaussian process with zero average. So the wavelet coefficients of each scale are also the stationary random Gaussian process with zero average [7]. From formula (5) we can be obtained the standard deviation of wavelet coefficients any scale. Thus, wavelet coefficients of every scale can be generated by Gaussian white noise with a certain standard deviation and zero mean. According to formula (6), signal of DLS satisfYing target spectrum can be generated by the inverse wavelet transform.

A Influence of decomposition scale Based on above introduced simulation method, DLS  signal with particles sizes 100nm, 300nm, 100nm were simulated respectively at two simulation parameters, simulation parameters is respectively as follows, is =10kHz dataN=i8, M=6; !, =lOkHz, dataN=i8, M=17. The power spectrum of every simulated signal were estimated by auto-regressive model. The power spectrum of simulation signal and its theory power spectrum are shown in Figure. 1 , Figure.2.

x 10     By comparison, we can see that, when decomposition scale is increases, for three kinds of particles, the power spectrum of simulated signal doesn't always agree with its theory value very well, at same sample frequency and the simulation data length, the small particles need smaller decomposition scale, on the contrary, the big particles increase decomposition scale and can get good simulation effects.

Reason of this phenomenon is as follow: for power spectrum of big particles is mainly in the low frequency, when decomposition scale is too small, power spectrum fitness  frequency(rad/s) (a)  4 xl0  point of low frequency band is too less and simulation effect is poor, for small particles, it is contrary.

B Influence of data length DLS signal of 200nm particles was simulated at  following two kinds of simulation parameters. The simulation parameters are respectively !, =10kHz, dataN=212, M=lO and !, =lOkHz, dataN=i9, M=lO. The power spectrum of simulation signal and its theory power spectrum are shown in Figure.3.

When data length is increased and simulation effect is contrary.

Reason of this phenomenon is that large data amount lose non-zero approximation signal at same decomposition scale.

When sample frequency is too small, according to sampling theorem, frequency band of simulation signal is not enough wide, simulation effects is poor. When sample frequency is too big, frequency band of every scale is very wide at same decomposition scale, fitness of power spectrum is coarse and simulation effects is also poor. Therefore, the appropriate sample frequency should be chosen in simulation.

In practice, the three parameters are mutually constraints.

We should integrate three parameters influence and select the appropriate simulation parameters.



IV. CONCLUSIONS  At different simulation parameters such as decomposition scale, data length and sample frequency, by analyzing consistency degree of theory power spectrum and power spectrum of simulation signal, this paper studies the influence of simulation parameters on simulation effect for DLS signal simulation method of wavelet transform.

Research show that, at same other two simulation parameters, the small particles need smaller decomposition scale, the big particles is contrary, too big data length and sample frequency, too small sample frequency can lead to poor simulation effect. In practice simulation, the three  parameters are mutually constraints. Appropriate simulation parameters can be chosen by integrating a three parameters influence.
