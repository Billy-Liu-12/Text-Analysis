I. INTRODUCTION  A. Motivation Worldwide medical image market divided into four major parts: image machine (47%), contrast agent (20%), service and maintenance (21%), and image information apparatus (12%).

[1]  X-ray image apparatus is a hot R & D topic in mainland China, Japan, South Korea, US and Europe. Taiwan government wants to develop X-ray industry. It is the object of this study to derive the patent trend of X-ray image and provide suggestions to local X-ray industry.

B. Industry Overview Kalorama estimated that digital x-ray system sales will  exceed those of traditional x-ray systems used for a medical (non-dental) purpose in 2011. According to the market report, revenues of digital x-ray systems was the largest component of the $12 billion radiography market, slightly higher than that of the traditional systems. [2]  Another report stated that new X-ray technology mixing CMOS circuits and advanced packaging technologies was currently under development by all major players of X-ray imaging such as Philips or Siemens. The solid-state medical image sensor market was driven by two major applications: X- ray imaging and endoscopy. [3]

II. LITERATURE REVIEW  A. Patent Classification 1) Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC)  Start from Jan. 1, 2013, there is a new patent classification system called ?Cooperative Patent Classification?. The Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC) is a joint project engaged by the European Patent Office (EPO) and the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to harmonize their classification systems (ECLA and USPC respectively) into a single system having a similar structure to the International Patent Classification (IPC) administered by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), a specialized agency of the United Nations, and is the only patent classification system used by all patent offices. The jointly developed classification system will be more detailed than the IPC to improve patent searching. [4]  2) FI/F-Term F-Terms, FI (File Index) and facets are specific classifications devised by the Japanese Patent Office for their in-house use. These tools make patent searching more quicker by sub-dividing and indexing technological subject matter. File Index is created to further subdivide classes from the slow-moving pre-reform IPC system.  The F-term system is designed to be an independent Japanese classification mechanism. [5]  B. Patent Analysis Many academic papers used patent data for industrial and  economics progress, such as Pavitt(1988), Bo-Heng Lin(2001) and Ting-Feng Chien(2001).[6][7][8] Many people used patent classification or keywords as tools for patent analysis. But combined keywords and classification for patent map were scare. So far, no paper combined CPC and F-term to analyze specific technology field.



III. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY In the past, most academic papers used USPC and IPC for  patent analysis. Since the creation of CPC, the technology field not only expanded to more than 250,000 fields, but also strengthened the product/technology correlation. F-term was created by Japanese government and very product/technology oriented. In the preliminary studies, e-commerce and 3D printing showed the combination of CPC and F-term were very useful.

Research flow chart was shown in Fig. 1.First, use keywords to retrieve the related CPC. Then combine CPC and keywords to select appropriate patents. Secondly, take advantage of F-term, IPC and CPC technology criteria to develop the position of X-ray image in the industry supply chain.

IV. RESULTS  A. Limitations of the Study Limitations of the Study This research was limited to US. Time range was Jan. 1, 1976 ~ July 31, 2013. The worldwide technology and market trend analysis can be the next research topic. Other patent analytical tools, such as originality, citing index, current impact index?etc., can combine this paper?s methodology to create new patent index.

B. US and Worldwide X-ray Patent Map.

1) US Patent Map  a) Application Year Analysis Fig. 2 showed that X-ray image patent application  increased quickly since 2005. It was unique and demonstrated this field was in developing stage. Since US is the largest market in the world, it is not a big surprise. Data on 2012 and 2013 were not accurate, since some early publication had not published yet.

Fig. 2. X-ray Image-US Application Year Analysis  b) Assignee Analysis From Fig. 3, Top X-ray image patent company was  Siemens. Second and third place were Philips and TOSHIBA, respectively. Europe and Japan companies were dominated in this field. General Electric (including subsidiary) was the only US company in the top 10.

c) CPC Analysis The major CPC of x-ray image was A61B 6/00:  Apparatus for radiation diagnosis (Fig. 4). Top three CPC were A61B6/032 (Transmission computed tomography), A61B 6/466 (adapted to display 3D data), and G06T19 (Manipulating 3D models or images for computer graphics).Very clearly, 3D technology was the key component in X-ray system. Fortunately, Taiwan electronic companies had strong technology background and capability in all three CPC. The serious concern was that ?do we have adequate patent portfolio to protect our investment??.

Fig. 5. X-ray Image-US CPC Analysis  1) Worldwide Patent Map  a) Application Year Analysis For worldwide patent application, it started around 1994,  and rose quickly after 2005. Just like that in US. It was still rising and the slope became steeper (Fig. 5).

Fig. 6. X-ray Image Worldwide Application Year Analysis  b) Assignee Analysis Fig. 6 showned that the top three X-ray patent assignees were Siemens, Philips and Fujifilm. Surprising, Fujifilm was not in the top 10 of the US assignees. Both US and worldwide assignees were alike. Siemens was not the leading company in US, so did in worldwide.

Fig. 7. X-ray Image Worldwide Assignee  Analysis  c) CPC Analysis Fig. 7 demontrated that the patent appolication of top  ten CPC worldwide were close. In US, it had the similar results. Top CPC was still the A61B6/032.

Fig. 8. X-ray Image Worldwide CPC Analysis  C. F-Term Analysis Since both U.S. and worldwide patent analysis indicated that IPC A61B were the key area for X-ray image. We used IPC A61B to retrieve the corresponding Japan F term, 4C093. Name of the 4C093 was ?apparatus for radiation diagnosis?. It consisted of 18 major viewpoints and 416 technical fields. Table I showed that IPC of x-ray image overlapped with 24 F-term technical fields: 4C093/AA26,4C093/AA27, 4C093/BA17,4C093/CA01, 4C093/CA09, 4C093/CA10, 4C093/CA12, 4C093/CA26,4C093/CA29,4C093/CA30, 4C093/EC11, 4C093/EC21, 4C093/EC29,4C093/EC32, 4C093/EC33, 4C093/EC35, 4C093/EE06, 4C093/FA22, 4C093/FA23, 4C093/FA23, 4C093/FA29, 4C093/FB03, 4C093/FF01, 4C093/FF04 and 4C093/FF21. If we assumed that F-term was similar to supply chain, the yellow space in Fig. 8 would show the position of x-ray image in x-ray industry.

V. CONCLUSIONS  This study used CPC, FI and F-term to analyze the X-ray image patent data. Due to the superior advantage of CPC, we could get more detailed results. The following results were useful for the local medical industry:  1. Both US and worldwide patent data showed that the technology trend were similar. IPC A61B was the major field.

2. Unlike the other medical image area, the leading companies were all international giant. Siemens held the strong position in X-ray field.

3. From Japan F-term viewpoint, X-ray image had many potential applications. Eighteen applications would be a good starting point for local industry.

4. New CPC will eventually come out as a powerful tool for the patent analysis. After 2015, the other patent classification will appear when CPC combine with Japan?s file index.

5. US is the leading medical equipment market in the world.

The technology trend of US will have profound influence for the entire world. One particular interesting finding was that the technology trend of US and worldwide were parallel.

6. According to the analysis data, it will take different strategy for Taiwan medical industry to succeed in X-ray image field. First of all, it had better cooperate with international powerhouses. Especially, Siemens, General Electric and Philips. Secondly, exclusive licensing and cross-licensing  are two good tools to negotiate the IP right. New business models are needed in the short and long term.

7. The technology complexity of X-ray image is lower than that of MRI and ultrasonic image. It actually is good for Taiwan medical industry.

8. F-term 4C093 can be used as blueprint for the local industry. Carefully study the depth of 18 technologies will give us more new directions for research and development.
