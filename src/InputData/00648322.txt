1 Introduction Recently, in the iriterriet, digital docuInents, programs, sounds, images, movies and various other types of re- sources organize the huge inforniatiori space. Espe- cially, it is very difficult to  jind out tlie adequate URLs including invaluable inforriaatiori and to  discover the relationship among world wide web sites[3].

Lycos, XltaVista and many other search engines in Table 1 have been developed arid they provide us informative URLs by slearch queries with boolean expressions[ 13, 51.

However, without rich background knowledge about the web space, it is too hard to  judge whether interest- ing documents really include the combination of a few keywords, especially in the cabe that those keywords may have different meanings in other domains. There- fore, in order to  describe adequate queries, it is irnpor- tant to  grasp the suitable cornbination or association of keywords, which exist in the database.

At present, we have been developing the search en- gine with applying techniques of text data rniriing to tlie web resource discoverv[7]. The algorithms of da ta mining or KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases) [4,  1060-3425198 $10.00 0 1998 IEEE Proc. 31st Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences  2, 61 derive some constraints, rules or patterns in var- ious types of databases. Our developing search engine provides association rule:j by the techniques of text da ta mining, and it is possible to  modify initial submitted query with boolean cxpressions including a few key- words.

111 this paper, we explain the ability of our develop- ing search system, which is named as Mor~dou, with ap- plying our proposed algo'rit hrri for weighted association rules to  huge number of web documents. Moreover, sirice collecting docurrirmts are written in .Japanese, we also use Japanese rnorphological analysis and othcr licuristic operations to  &rive Japanese keywordls.

R.CAAU stands for "iretrieval location by wciglited association rule" in the digital "Inoiide", and pro- nounced "kIo-n-do-u." TTsing associatve keywords pro- vided by kloridou, we niav gain insight into one of the rnetliods of Zen. Tlie UR.L1 is also listed in the J a p a ~ i e ~ e  net search page of Netscape Navigator.

Our bio~idou executed more than one million queries required by aIioIiyrrious users from February iIi 1996.

We analyze the part od httpd log, which has been recorded by the apache server, arid evaluate the effec- tiveness of our proposed. search strategies.

2 Structure of web space In this section, me characterize the structure of web space, in order to  discolver important clusters of web documents. For example, when we have to  check a few web documents, it is very useful to  get the relation between the access page arid other popular web1 pages.

Actually, me often make the list of cool web pages based on the voting of internet users. Then, we analyze web space as a typical structure of loosely connected hyper graph in Figure 1, and we try to evaluate the features of the interesting web pages by following two types of hyper links.

spectively. Thus, we can caliculate p k ,  as the approxi- mate reference score based on the several attribute val- ues with web documents.

Figure 3 shows typical graphs of average reference score p k ,  that  are evaluated for 6,621 parent documents including 18,397 links in jp-domain with W$(= 10) and WO(= 30).

At first, from these simple graphs, we want to  ex- tract important clusters of documents from web space.

However, it is too hard to  discover the relation between the cluster of interesting web pages Ch and attribute values ( s p ,  z p ,  o p ) ,  document size, the number of inside links, or the number of outside links.

Therefore, in this paper, we regard the web space as a simple text database without document clusters, which doesn't have any integrated da ta  model. In the following section, we try to  derive other rules from the huge amount of text da ta  stored in the internet by sev- eral kinds of algorithms for text da ta  mining.

3 Text data mining in the web space  In recent years da ta  mining is noteworthy field t o be studied based on various kinds of researches, such as machine learning, inductive learning, search and knowledge representation, with considering character- istic features of database[l2, 4, 61. Many rnining algo- rithms, such as tuple-oriented ulgorithm with depen- dency between tuples or uttribute-oriented induct ion ulgorithm which generalizes at.tributes with taxonorriy information, provide us useful knowledge as rules, con- straints, regularities and others.

In this section, we try to  extend the algorithm t o derive association rule[ll,  11, which is one of tuple- oriented algorithms.

3.1 Association rulle  lye have a brief introductiori to  rnining association rule.

For example, the rule of "program + database" from  the sets of { program } andi { program, database } will be found in databases by the following typical threshold values.

Create all the rules whose confidence is equal to  or greater than mzuconf,  which is the threshold value to determine the confidence-rated rules. If { program } and { program, database } are found from the set of keywords, we create the ride "program =+ database," where s*uppo'rt of the rule is the value of { program,  database }, and con.fidence of the rule is givcn by di- viding the sfupport of former by the later support value.

3.2 Weighted association rule  We extend the previous rnining algorithm t.0 handle weighted keywords for markup language, especially for tags in HTML.

Definition 1 In the cuse of retrieving keyword k j ,  if k .  J U' p p  e m s  wij t i~mes in ;t.uple,TiJ 'we m y  that k j  has the  0 'weight of wij; aad de.fin$e uij  = (k j ,Wij) .

Next, we select tuples T,(i E I) including set of key- mords K = {k , I j  E J }  firorn all the tuple set 7. Given T, including u tJ  = ( kJ ,2c t J ) ,  we have to  evaluate the support s u p ( K ) .  s u p ( K )  can be defined by the follom- ing equations, where K includes any cornbination of keywords from all the kevwords K related with retriev- ing.

Besides, the next inequality shows that support is appropriately defined for set of keywords Ii'l i5nd h; that satisfy KI C K2.

Table 2: URL and list of (keyword, weight value).

Example of weighted association rules: TVe will show several tables i r i  the steps of mining  rules by applying our proposed algorithm.

The pair of URL and weighted keywords are stored  in the database in Table 2. Let?s assume that we try to search tuples including lreyword ?maiiagcrncnt? arid more than two other words. The result is shown in Table 3.

And next step, me can execute mining algorithm to derive association rule. By applying our proposed al- gorithm with ,rrLi,rwup 115 in section 3.1, all freyueCrLt keyword-sets are shown as Table 4.

As a result, the association rule tree, for example, with mincoq f  1/4 can be calculated as Table 6. Conse- quently, me will get the associative keywords of ?pro-  Table 5 :  Verbose-removed keyword sets.

Espe- cially, we make it possible to  retrieve web documents more sophisticatedly by using feedback of associative kevmords. Actually, many internet users can easily fo- cus on interesting web resources without taxonomy, or intelligent da ta  dictionary given by database adminis- trators.

4.1 Our  Mondou: web search engine with mining algorithm Structure of M[ondou  Mondou system consists of the following three - main modules, agent, database, query server, which are shown in Figure 4.

CGI r--J--l I I i  I Database I Figure 4: The structure of Mondou system.

The first module is often called as the robot program, spider or uyent[9], and this prograni collects web pages in the internet and store them into the text database.

In addition to  the norniall function of the robot, our intelligent agent parses collected documents by sev- eral methods including natural language processing[lO] for Japanese documents. Moreover, in order to  collect more interesting documents, our agent often visits to special URLs as interesting web pages, if they are re- ferred many times from other web pages.

The detabuse stores da t a  not only about keywords, but also the number of links from other URLs. U'e have to  prepare the several tables for several different attributes, keywords, UR.I,s, hyper links, http servers, stop words, IP addresses and coiitrol/rriariagerrieIit da ta for Mondou system.

The q.uer.y ser-uer is the ,search program, which is ex- ecuted by CGI (Common Gate Interface), and it pro- vides search results and mining association rules to  the users. The mining algorithm is described in the previ- ous subsection 3.2.

The input web page of hlondou system is shown in Figure 6, it is possible t o  eriter any suitable corribi- nation of search keyword!j using AND, NOT boolean expressions in each empty box.

For examle, when he/she submitted initial keyword knowkdge ,  Mondou provbded him/her several rules as  associative keywords, "engineering, systems, "knowl- edge" (in Japanese), acquisition" and so on, which is shown in Figure 7. Consequently, even by applying our proposed algorithm without taxonomies, concep- tual trees or ontologies, he/she can grasp the associ- ation or relation among important keywords it1 those interesting web pages.

4.2 Extension of Mondou in heteroge- neous dat ab<ases  At present, we try to  extend the implementation of Mondou as a full t.ext search system, and also to derive much more effective rules from heterogeneous databases.

Firstly, we use full t,ext retrieval systems as basic database systems in Figure 5 .  T$.'e conibine the pro- grams of Mondou system arid the interface program, which is the agents for t tie full text database, and try to provide typical communication interface using KQnlL language.

Secondly, we implement the CGI programs and the mining program to  derive different set of association rules from heterogeneous databases.

Using the search res.ults and the association rules from heterogeneous dat,abases, improved Mondou sys- tem can provide more effective keywords to  users. In Figure 9, after selecting of electrical news "fj.rec.autos" as one of databases, we enter the keyword ",oil" (in Japanese) into improved hloridou system. 111 the re- sults, improved nloiidoii system provide us mo:re inter- estirig associative keywords which are tightly related to the domain of "autos".

4.3 Evaluation of Mondou  lye are operating bIontlou system in the internet, and we examine the quality of niariy search queries, pat- terns of combination of keywords arid other features.

Table 7 shows typical examples of derived kevmords, the nurnber of URLs and associative keywords derived by mining algorithm.

By using associative keywords, we can easily get in- teresting combination of keywords that can be treated as several meanings in web documents. I t  is helpful for many users to  grasp the structure of web documents by associative keywords.

From February to  October in 1996, Mondou executed 931,537 queries submitted from the users. Surprisingly, there are only 20,734 queries (2.23%) with NOT expres- sion, it is too difficult for most of users to  describe the querv with adequate NOT keywords.

Moreover, the number of unique query patterns is 338,535. Most of users used only one keyword in the query, 51,510 patterns (15.2%) are described by one word. On the ot.her hand, 287,025 (84.8%) patterns are described using cornbination of more than two key- words. Generally speaking, it is too difficult to  describe various cornbination of keywords.

Furthermore, keywords including all executed queries cov-ers 129,445 words (40.5%) for all 319,426 keywords, which are stored in the database. Therefore, according t o  the statistics of nlondou system, most of users seem to  submit modified query using the derived associative keywords.

As a result, Mondou provides the rich cornbination of keywords in order to  modify initial submitted query.

Even if users don't know well about web documents to  be find out, it should be possible to reach the in- teresting URLs. By using text data  niinirig algorithm in Mondou, web users can get much more information about the relationship of keywords in the natural way.

4.4 Visual interface for Mondou  It is necessary to  improve the web browsing interface by visualization, especially for the results of search engine we often want to  check the accesibility of the documents and the status of networks from our site. Furthermore, it is easy to  discover the interesting association rules by the drawing of graphs. Therefore, in order t o  visualize several attibute values and rules me have been devel- oping an interactive search interface in Java language.

111 Figure 8, in order to  display the search results on     the browser, we use several drawing functions, shupes; coders: interuul of blinkany it.imLe, urrows and other at- tributes. Especially, we hzvve to  pay attention to  the access cost to  the URL from users and the relevance score of docunierits satisfying search query. By the implementation of present Java programs, each URL is shown with several attributes, the access cost, the score of documents, color m d  hyper links. Figure 8 shows one of visual examples for search results with the keyword "applied".

5 Conclusions aind future works The volume of text data  in the web is increasing expo- Iientiallv, it makes difficult to  find the useful or suitable UR.Ls providing rich contents. Several search engines in the web makes it possible to  retrieve web documents by usual text database. However, users niay not judge easily whether the docurrierits have useful information, especially in the case that given keywords have wide concept.

In this paper, in order to  .retrieve efficiently web doc- uments by suitable queries., we applied the algoritlirn of mining association rules, which is extended to  han- dle weiglited keywords in H'TML, to  the wcb document collected by robots. A s  a result, users can focus on the URLs appropriately by applying our rules without de- pending conceptual tree, or rneta knowledge. We could confirm that our proposed :algorithm works very eKec- tively in searching text data  in the web. We also devel- oped the visual interface iIi Java for efficient searching on web browsers.

Still now, me have been using centralized systems for kIondou, but they have to be distributed in order to keep much more UR.Ls arid to focus on URLs more effectively since web grows very rapidly.
