Abstract: Knowledge management is fast becoming a commercial  necessity for many organizations, in order that they manage their intellectual assets and gain competitive advantage. To maximize that advantage, knowledge management needs to be available across the whole of the enterprise. Before a knowledge management system can be built, the knowledge that pervades the organization must he identified and recovered. This paper applies artificial intelligence (A0 techniques within traditional knowledge frameworks to mine association rules for supporting organizational knowledge management and decision making. The mining procedure consists of two essential modules. One is a clustering module based on a neural network, a Self-organization Map (SOM), which performs grouping tasks on the tremendous number of database records. The other is a rule extraction module applying rough set theory that can extract association rules for each homogeneous cluster and the relationships between different clusters. A simple example is used for describing.

Keywords:  Knowledge management  1 Introduction  Data mining; Self-organizing Map; Rough set theory;  As we enter the new millennium, we realize a shift in the business model from the ole static model, based on hierarchic organizations, towards a dynamic model, built on top of continuously changing and knowledge-based organizations. Knowledge management (KM) is emerging as the new growing interest that provides the mechanisms for systematically managing the knowledge that evolves with the enterprise. Most large organizations have been experimenting with knowledge management with a view to improving profits, being competitively innovative, or simply to survive [I1, Furthermore, exploiting technology enables organizations to derive knowledge from data and information collected as the business proceeds. It then may be exploited in decision-making, product development,  0-7803-786C2/03/$17.00 02003 IEEE  human resource, customer relationships, the supply chain and so on. Clearly, knowledge management needs to infiltrate every aspect of the enterprise to improve business efficiency. Before a knowledge management system can be built, the knowledge that pervades the organization must be identified and recovered. This paper applies artificial intelligence (AI) techniques within traditional knowledge frameworks to mine association rules for supporting organizational knowledge management and decision making.

Data mining is one of the most important techniques that can find potential useful knowledge, such assignificant pattems and rules, from databases in supporting of making better decisions. The data mining tasks include association rules extracting, clustering, classifying, forecasting, and so on. An association rule is represented as x a Y , where X and Yare a set of items. The rule means that the records in database that contain X tend to contain Y. A good number of efficient algorithms for mining association rules have been proposed  Clustering is a task of partitioning a population into a number of clusters or subgroups with similar features.

There are numerous clustering algorithms such as the k-means method, the divisive methods, the grid-based method, the self-organizing map, and so on. Kiang, Kulkarni and Tam(2000)L51 used SOM to group similar parts into part families to be manufactured; Vellido, lisboa, and Meehan(I999)l6] used SOM to cluster data and find the potential interest for on-line marketers; Changchien and L ~ ( 2 0 0 1 ) ~ ~  used SOM and rough set theory to support on-line recommendation by customers and products fragmentation. SOM networks have been successii~lly applied as a classification tool to various problem domains, including speech recognition, image data compression, image or character recognition, market segmentation, customer targeting, and medical diagnosis. In this paper, however, a neural network, a Self-organizing Map (SOM), will be applied to cluster the customer characters in order to discovery more knowledge and experiences to improve the quality and performance in the business management. The      SOM network serves as a clustering tool that can group sale actions into appropriate categories based on the similarities in the characteristics of a given set of customer records. It performs unsupervised training for group technology so it doesn't require the knowledge of the corresponding output for comparison and learning. That is to say that the input pattems, during the process, adjust their weights based on the lateral feedback.connections. The advantages of SOM network are good at transforming multi-dimensional inputs into a map of fewer dimensions and being easily used for classification of new entities into existing clusters without repeating the clustering process. Thus, it is very suitable for presenting the group distributions of the customer characters that are consisted of multiple attributes. But the drawback of SOM network is that it can't explain the clustering results specifically. This paper, for this reason, combines the rough set theory to achieve the goal-mining the association rules to explain the meaning of each cluster and the relationships between of them.

Rough set theory clarities set-theoretic characteristics of the classes over combinatorial patterns of the attributes. This theory can be used to acquire some sets of attributes for classification and can also evaluate the degree of the attributes of database that are able to classify data. It uses the lower and upper sets that proposed by Lin and Cercone in 1997"'. Several applications and extensions of the rough set theory have also been proposed. The reason for success in knowledge acquisition is that the rough set theory offers opportunities to discover useful information in training examples. Coming with more social problems existed in our country, how to integrate the available resources well to solve the exist problems and detect the potential problems is a challenging work. This paper, therefore, combine the strength of this two techniques to achieve the challenging task - more potential knowledge discovery in decision- making, product development, human resource, customer relationships, the supply chain and so on.

2 Theory and Model  2.1 Self-Orgauizing Map (SOM)  The basic SOM network has an input layer and an output layer. When training data sets are fed into the network, SOM will compute a winning node. The winning node and neighborhood weights will he adjusted during learning (training) process until it converges to form clusters with similar properties. The rules for clustering subgroups may be difficult to be defined, but SOM offers the flexibility to decide the composition and the number of clusters based on the selected objective and subjective criteria, such as  ,  customer age, personality, professional and so on. Beyond this, SOM network can he easily used for classification of new entities into existing clusters that the whole clustering process doesn't have to be repeated. The groupings can thus be continually adjusted in quick response to the change of environment.

2.2 Rough Set Theory  The rough set theory is a new mathematical approach to imprecision, vagueness, and uncertainty. The vague concepts were replaced by the precise concepts: the lower and the upper approximation of the vague concepts.

Approximations are two basic operations 6 the rough set theory, The idea can he presented in the following manner.

Let U he a universe, A be a finite set of attributes, B be a subset of A, X be a subset of the universe, and I be an equivalence relation on U, called an indiscemible relation.

I(B)(x) , in short B(x), is an equivalence class containing an element x. Let us define the two basic operations, the B-lower and the B-upper approximations, on sets in the rough set theory:  B * ( X ) = { x ? U : B ( x ) ~ X }  (1) B'(X)= {x E U : B ( x )  E X # 4) (2)  We usually use the rough member ship function, called the confidence function to define approximations and the boundary region of a set. The confidence function is defined as:  cF(x)E[o , l ]  denotes the degrees of bow Where the element x belongs to the set X in -view of the indiscemible relation I. The confidence function of the lower and the upper approximation c& be redefined respectively 3s follows:  B*(X)= {x E U :  CF(X) = I}  B'(X)  = {x E U : CF(X) > 0 ) This paper applies the rough set theory to each cluster  for finding out some rules for association explanation, such as the characterization to the customers. The purpose of the paper is mining more detail knowledge for managers making the best strategies in response to the changeable business environment.

3 Knowledge discovery process  Knowledge discovery is an interactive and iterative process involving several steps. Data mining is one of the     steps in it. Figure 1 shows the process of .  knowledge discovery while the data mining procedure is showed in  Figure 2. In Figure 1, there are three procedures connected closely for achieving the goals.

Figure 1: Knowledge discovery procedure  First, managers select the target data set as the training data for the mining purpose and then to preprocess the selected data for the next procedure. The data mining procedure then starts to search for interesting pattems by the clustering module and rule extraction module. Afler the data mining of association rules, the work of rules evaluation is performed to eliminate weak rule under the initial values created by the knowledge workers. The useful rules are stored with different presentation styles in the knowledge bases that may be the case bases, rule bases and so on. They can be used as the strategies or some experiential laws in providing better recommendation and high-degree prediction. In this paper, we focus on clustering and association rules extraction in data mining tasks and following is the complete procedure of data mining for recommendation.

3.1 Data preprocessing (Step 1)  Before proceeding to data mining on data set, raw data must be preprocessed in order to decrease the mining time and facilitate the effectiveness. The data preprocessing  process consists of two modules: clearingkelection module and transformation module.

1.) Data clearing / selection module: The users can retrieve data with constraints such as the range of an attribute for mining purposes. The procedure involves integration of multiple databases, removal of noises, and handling of missing data fields.

2.) Data transformation module: To have the same ranges, the target data should be normalized and/or scaled if it is necessary. Since this paper uses a SOM network for data clustering, the target data would be transformed to values ranged between 0 and I .  Here are two different formulas used to transform data.

a.) If attribute =number then  reponse-value,, = (value,, - min(attj))  (max(att,) - min(att,)) (6)  Where response-valuejk is the normalized value for the f i  attribute of record k, min(attj),is the minimum value of thefi attribute while max(attj) is h e  maximum value of the f i  attribute and valuejk is thg original value of the 3      contributes to each output node with a weight. Insection 2, we show the flow chart for clustering. The SOM network  attribute of record k.

b.) If attributenon-number then specific data trans-  formation scaling should be assigned by the user. For instance, the data type of attribute job is character. The user has to assign a normalized numerical response value to it.

After the training phase, the weights are converged to the values that can be used to assign data items to their corresponding clusters.

For instance, the managers can choose two attributes for a certain production: the degree of customer loyalty and the degree of necessary promotion as the SOM input nodes.

Table 1 presents a simple example of clustering results of sale actions, where D is the degree of customer loyalty, P is the degree of necessary promotion, GID is a cluster number with special sales characteristics and ID is the sale action identification number.

Rough set theory not only can extract association rules for each homogeneous cluster but also can find out the relationships for attributes among different clusters.' Figure 2 shows the steps of rule extraction module and their descriptions are as below:  a.) Set initial confidence value. It is used to filter the lower and upper approximation rules unsatisfying the threshold value that is assigned by the users for holding the rules with high explainable abilities.

b.) Generate result equivalence classes. Let X, denote the result equivalence class that consists of a set of objects for cluster i. Table 2 lists the clusters for a table sale actions.

X, means that the sale action in this cluster is belonged to the degree A.

Table 2: Results equivalence classes  When all attributes have the same measurement and ranges, then the association rules extraction process is proceeding. In this process, the SOM network based clustering module starts first and then a rough set theory based Nle extraction module is employed to discovery association rules.

1) Clustering module The SOM network is an unsupervised two-layer network proposed by Kobonen that can recognize a topological map from a random star&ing point. In SOM network, input nodes and output nodes are fully connected with each. other. Each input node  c.) Generate case equivalence classes. Let & denote the cause equivalence class that consists of a set of objects having a specific attribute j with value of k(Ajd. The Table 3 gives the case equivalence classes..

Table 3: Cause equivalence classes  I AA I Y., I     Y D L = ( ~ I  .TI YPN= (2) j = P  k = H  YPH= (4A6I  YPI. = ( 1.3)  d.) Create lower approximation rules. Let Ap(XJ denote the set of objects that have the same attribute values(Ajk) all contained in cluster i. Here Eq.(l) is used to create lower approximation rules. For example, for XI = { 2 3 )  where GID = A (Table 2), APN.(X$ = { 2) satisfies the constraint, so we have found a lower approximation rule, which is ?RI: If necessary promotion = N then GlD = A?.

Accordingly, all the lower approximation rules can be found and the confidence of every lower approximation rule is 100%.

e.) Create upser approximation rules and compute confidences. Let Ajk (XJ denote the set of objects that have the same attribute values(Aj) only some but not all contained in cluster i. Here Eq. (2) and (3) are used to create upper approximation rules and to compute rules? confidences. Continue with the previous example, for GID = A, contained by only some of the objects in YDH and YPH that are contained in XI. Hence there are two upper approximation rules for XI, which are ?R2: If customer loyalty = H then GlD = A? and ?R3: If necessary promotion = H then GID = A?. Using.Eq. (3) compute these two upper approximation rules? confidence. Here analysts can use the threshold value (minimum confidence) that are predetermined to decide which rules will be accepted. The confidence for R2 is 2/3 and for R3 is 113.

If the minimum confidence is set to 50%, only R2 will he accepted.

U  Figure 3: The combinatorial rules  f.) Create new combinatorial rules. This step considers two or more attributes to generate association rules. First, we join each class in cause equivalence classes. In the above example, Figure 3 displays the results of joins of APH with the other attribute degree of customer loyalty to find the combinatorial rules. Oply one node ADH,pH*(Xl) that combines two classes ADH(X,) and Api(X1) that.is not empty.

{5}) The confidence of ADH,PH*(Xl) therefore is calculated  as follows: CF(ADH,pH*(XI))=Min(7,;? 1 1  =?=0.33 1  Here we can define the confidence function of an n-attribute combinatorial rule:  n x k ) )  Nu4(xl n%))  ...

?  CI+) = Mi  (7) So we create a new combinatorial rule ?R4: If  customer loyalty = H and prompion = H , then GID = A, CF = 0.33(equals to the CF(APH (XI))) ?.

g.) Explain the characteristics of each cluster. Rules !iom RI to R4 are used to explain the meaning of cluster A.

In the above example, the sale actions in cluster A have following characteristics: 100% sale actions in cluster A need the promotion measure belonged to normal level, about 1/3 sale actions in cluster A whose customer loyalty level is high and promotion need is high, and about 2/3 sale actions in cluster A whose degree of customer loyalty is high.

h.) Go to d.), to process the next equivalence class X, and repeat until all the result equivalence classes are completed.

3.3 Evaluation and presentation (Step 3)  After all related rules are created, analysts can use evaluation module to eliminate unused or redundant rules in order to keep the most valuable rules in the knowledge bases that may be the case bases or/and rule bases for fnture use.

According to the sale characteristics (quantity, pattem, and size) in the sale action table and other potential associations of interesting attributes (how to close a deal with a particular type of client, or how to develop an      effective advertising campaign) in the sale actions table, we can create many rules with different purposes. The managers retrieve these rules stored in the knowledge bases to determine the best decision making in all kinds of business areas.

4 Conclusion  This paper has briefly described how to integrate a neural network-SOM and rough set theory to discover association rules to support knowledge management.

Clustering module based on the SOM network separates the customers into clusters and a rule extraction module is used to characterize each cluster and explain the relationships  ' among different clusters. These rules may help the managers to find out the useful measure to maintain old customers and develop new customers. The data mining procedure can be use for offering the associations between customer relationships, product development, h q resource, the supply chain and so on. However, there is still space for the future research I

I.)  A tool with intelligent ability may be developed to dynamically include feedback and attributes for analysis.

2.) The clustering module based on the SOM network would be combined with tbe fuzzy concept to group uncertain or non-numerical data in order to discover the associations more close to the real environment.

3.) The analysis and development of the prototype may take into account more factors for future implementation.

Besides, the more efficient association rules mining and filtering algorithms may also be the future work.
