I. INTRODUCTION  Among the recent advances on Data Warehousing and OLAP over Big Data [1], [2], analytics over Big Data play a relevant role in this research area. Analytics can be intended as complex procedures running over large-scale, enormous-in-size data repositories whose main goal is that of extracting useful knowledge kept in such repositories.

Analytics over Big Data repositories has recently received a great deal of attention from the research communities.

One of the most significant application scenarios where Big Data arise is, without doubt, scientific computing. Here, scientists and researchers produce huge amounts of data per-day via experiments (e.g., think of disciplines like high- energy physics, astronomy, biology, bio-medicine, and so forth) but extracting useful knowledge for decision making purposes from these massive, large-scale data repositories is almost impossible for actual DBMS-inspired analysis tools.

From a methodological point of view, two main research  challenges arise. The first one is represented by the issue of conveying Big Data stored in heterogeneous and different-in- nature data sources (e.g., legacy systems, Web, scientific data repositories, sensor and stream databases, social networks) into a structured, hence well-interpretable, format, which is then ready to populating OLAP data cubes modeling the target analytics. The second one is represented by the issue of managing, processing and transforming so-extracted structured data repositories in order to derive Business In- telligence (BI) components like diagrams, plots, dashboards, and so forth, for decision making purposes, hence effectively realizing the complex analytics view.

What described till now depicts a complex methodology  for supporting analytics over Big Data lying at the conver- gence between Data-Warehousing/OLAP and data-intensive  Cloud infrastructures, particulary devoted to data-intensive applications [3]. Indeed, modeling, defining, implementing, and executing analytics over Big Data implies the availabil- ity of high-performance, scalable, elastic, infrastructures like Clouds, coupled with the expressive power and the flexibil- ity of Data Warehousing and OLAP analysis capabilities.

Nevertheless, it is important to understand the specialized kind of integration among these powerful paradigms. Indeed, according to our vision, data-intensive Cloud infrastructures should not be viewed as modern alternatives to Data- Warehousing/OLAP platforms, perhaps more scalable and with high performance, just because they both aim at similar goals. Rather, we argue that the these paradigms should be sequentially integrated such that (i) Cloud infrastruc- tures should act as a sort of high-performance, scalable staging area layer in the classical Data-Warehousing/OLAP architecture and (ii) this staging area should populate the subsequent Data Warehousing layer and OLAP layer as to define complex analytics systems that are more and more powerful, adaptable and scalable.

This paper briefly investigates main research challenges  arising at the convergence of Data Warehousing, OLAP and Cloud Infrastructures, and explores possible research directions.



II. STATE-OF-THE-ART ANALYSIS  Actually, research challenges deriving from this so- depicted integration are of emerging interest for a wide spectrum of research communities. As a consequence, this has generated a rich literature. At the industrial research side, Hadoop [4] and Hive [5] are two fortunate implementations of the ETL (Extraction-Transformation-Loading) layer and the BI layer of Big Data applications, respectively. These layers may be exploited to further improve the described ar- chitecture. Hadoop runsMapReduce [6] tasks over Big Data, and also it makes available the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) [4] for supporting file-oriented, distributed data management operations efficiently [7].

Several studies, like [8], [9], have provided recommenda-  tions for further improving the computational capabilities of Hadoop, whereas [10] proposes HadoopDB, a novel  2013 IEEE 37th Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference  DOI 10.1109/COMPSAC.2013.152     hybrid architecture that combines MapReduce and tradi- tional DBMS technologies for supporting advanced analytics over large-scale data repositories. Furthermore, Starfish [11] is a recent self-tuning system for supporting Big Data analytics that is still based on Hadoop but it incorporates special features trying to achieve higher performance by means of adaptive metaphors. By looking at BI aspects of analytics over Big Data, the state-of-the-art research result is represented by Hive [5], a BI system/tool for querying and managing structured data built on top of the Hadoop?s HDFS. Hive which allows us to obtain the final analytics components (in the form of diagrams, plots, dashboards, and so forth) from the Big Data processed, materialized and stored via Hadoop.



III. OPEN RESEARCH ISSUES AND POSSIBLE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS  From the depicted convergence, there still are a number of open research problems, some of which we report next.

Building Multidimensional Structures On Top Of The HDFS. This problem refers to the issue of building multidi- mensional data structures on top of the structured HDFS repositories of Haadop, as a first step towards directly integrating multidimensional data models with analytics over Big Data. A promising direction to this end consists in exploiting array-based in-memory representation methods.

Directly Integrating Multidimensional Data Sources Into The Hadoop Lifecycle. Hadoop populates the underlying structured Big Data repositories from heterogeneous and different-in-nature data sources, such as legacy systems, Web, scientific data sets, sensor and stream databases, social networks, and so forth. Despite this, no research efforts have been devoted to the yet-relevant issue of directly integrating multidimensional data sources into the Hadoop lifecycle, which is an exciting research challenge for next-generation Data Warehousing and OLAP research.

Modeling and Designing Multidimensional Extensions of HiveQL. In order to achieve an effective integration of multidimensional data models with analytics over Big Data, the query language HiveQL must be enriched with multidi- mensional extensions as well. These extensions should take into consideration language syntax aspects as well as query optimization and evaluation aspects, perhaps by inheriting lessons learned in the context of actual MDX-like languages for multidimensional data.

Design Complex Analytics over Hadoop-Integrated Mul- tidimensional Data. Multidimensional data provide add- on value to Big Data analytics. In this respect, design complex analytics over Hadoop-integrated multidimensional data plays a critical role. Actual analytics, although quite well-developed, still do not go beyond classical BI com- ponents, like diagrams, plots, dashboards, and so forth, but  complex BI processes of very large organizations demand for more advanced BI-oriented decision support tools, perhaps by integrating principles and results of different-in-nature disciplines like statistics.

Dealing with Visualization Issues Arising From Big Multidimensional Data Analytics. Visualization issues rep- resent a leading problem in Data Warehousing and OLAP research. These issues get worse when re-visited in the context of Big Multidimensional Data analytics, as here visualization must kept a stronger decision-support value.

More complex techniques, such as multidimensional space exploration approaches, must be investigated to this end.



IV. CONCLUSIONS  In this paper, we explored the convergence of Data Ware- housing, OLAP and data-intensive Cloud Infrastructures in the context of so-called analytics over Big Data. From the analysis of actual results and from the preliminary design of a possible integration architecture, future research directions have been proposed and discussed.
