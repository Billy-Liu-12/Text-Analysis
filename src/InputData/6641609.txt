Learning Effect Through International Sub-Contracting Arrangement   in Aircraft Industry in China

Abstract--The paper investigates engineering technology  learning effects in international sub-contracting production projects in aircraft industries in China. As aircraft industries usually represent most sophisticated technology, or complex product and complex technology sectors, knowledge learning effect can be heavily questioned with theoretical and practical problems. A research framework is provided by this study, including investigation through collaborative process and output performance in terms of overall economic plus quality performance, and knowledge learning effect; a corresponding questionnaire based survey data over 119 acceptable sample respondents at a typical Chinese aircraft company are processed and analyzed, knowledge learning effects are studied, especially contrasted under the two influencing factors (collaborative linkage as positive and technology gap as negative). The research finding indicates that there is still technology gap existing in such international sub-contracting arrangement, however, knowledge learning effect can be significant if both parties closely collaborate in typical operations, and technology gaps are not significantly big.



I. INTRODUCTION   In past 30 years, the international subcontracting production of the aviation industry of China has developed from the low-level mode of Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) to the current mode of strategic partnership and risk share partners with western aircraft integrators, implying not only economic development quality issue but also technology transfer effects in typical so called Complex Product System (CoPS).

In fact, there has been great deal of concerns on development rules in CoPS based manufacturing sectors, when more traditional concept of manufacturing industry has been increasingly mixed with diversified market demand-driven and service oriented production system, characterized more as global value chain (GVC) based [1], cross boundary technology resources determined process.

Marengoa and Valenteb[2] summarize that innovation in manufacturing sectors are primarily driven by increasingly three factors, namely, product innovation embedded in capital goods (or equipment based product innovation), heterogeneous process innovation in parallel with product innovation, and more complex nature of such sectors with multi-component and multi-technology resources. This is exactly reflecting typical CoPS sectors such as innovation and technology resource demand in aircraft industries.

In China, international sub-contracting projects in aircraft industries were started in end of 1970?s and beginning of 1980?s, with initial step characterized as compensation trade and OEM based contracting. Gradually some of the aircraft  companies have been developed from component manufacturing, through sub-system manufacturing, to be solely supplier or members of the excellent suppliers worldwide and ?core suppliers?, as well as strategic partners with those international integrators [3]. This implies that some of the suppliers in China have been already standing as more competitive suppliers for certain part or certain subsystem of typical multinational aircraft companies.

Almost half of the companies, research institutes, and manufacturing factories, to some extent, involved in such kind of sub-contracting projects. Along with rapid development in this type of international collaboration, such sub-system or key components for the final integrators has been upgrading for recent years, which also indicates clear trend of closer production and technical collaboration, and well developed position in qualified manufacturing standard of Chinese aircraft industries.

In this regard, typical questions would be asked, what kind of technology and knowledge Chinese companies have learnt through such kind of international sub-contracting arrangement in such typical complex product system industries? Can this collaboration really the successful route to continually upgrading advanced technologies in the industries, towards more sophisticated level, or even as a closer and strategic partner of the international production through collaborative learning may only help to develop technology in production and some engineering stage, and may not be possible to surpass more sophisticated stage? This article is aimed at answering such kinds of questions by detailed questionnaires and corresponding research.



II. NATURE OF COMPLEXITY IN TECHNICAL  KNOWLEDGE IN AIRCRAFT INDUSTRIES AND RELATED SUBCONTRACTING TRADE RELATIONS.

Nature of the technology resources in aircraft industries  can be reflected in many different fields, namely, 1. Digital manufacturing: this is one of the key  manufacturing technologies in aircraft industries, which may include: digital production line, digitalized workshop, high efficiency numeral controlled manufacturing, compound material manufacturing, melting technologies, measurement and testing techniques, and flexible workmanship & facilities, three dimension / virtual manufacturing, etc., these kinds of technologies may greatly shorten manufacturing time, raise production quality, and lower down manufacturing cost.

2. Special techniques [4]; e.g., ? High energy beam processing techniques;   2013 Proceedings of PICMET '13: Technology Management for Emerging Technologies.

? Special melting techniques (e.g. for manufacturing aircraft engines);  ? Precision manufacturing techniques; ? Coating techniques; ? Faster component manufacturing techniques; etc..

3. Structural installation technologies [4] ? Precision flexible drilling technology; ? Flexible installation and workmanship unit  technologies; ? Automation of installation, with flexible connection to  typical part and components; 4. Non-destructive testing technologies; etc.,   These different advanced technologies are increasingly key resources in high end manufacturing sectors, particularly in aeronautic and astronautic products. In this regard, only those technologically capable companies in different manufacturing fields can play specific roles in international sub-contracting or in global value chains.

On the other hand, international sub-contracting projects can range between low and high end manufacturing divisions.

In its very nature, international sub-contracting production in China at the very beginning was conducted under the business model called ?compensation trade?, which involves less foreign currency based deals but rather through barter (sub-system was produced in China as payment to aircraft companies for related airplanes purchased). However, after continual learning through such ?compensation trade?, manufacturing technologies and quality control system have been well developed, and the technical nature of sub-contracting has then upgraded. On the other hand, integrators, or buyers of the sub-contracted components / sub-system are also willing to develop such kind of global chain based operation. Considering highly expensive technology and manufacturing resources in aircraft industries, such as above mentioned typical technologies in the sector, major purpose of such internationally conducted sub-contracting projects by larger multinational integrators is generally to lower R&D cost, to diversify research and development risks, to use effectively worldwide qualified manufacturing resources, and to access expending market. On the other hand, suppliers as dependent partner to international integrator can also benefit through this kind of collaboration by access to high end manufacturing sectors, and can even control related market if the supplier positions as a unique partner, due to its highly competitive advantages in bottle neck technologies alike.

As companies in typical developing countries such as in China, suppliers under sub-contracting arrangement may take different route to upgrade their own production technologies and internationally qualified operation system. Obviously, technology learning is the basis for such technology innovation and upgrading. Consequently, there is no simple definition of subjective or passive partner in this collaboration.

However, studies on effective pattern of  inter-organizational learning, especially in global value chain based collaborative learning, such as in international sub-contracting in aircraft industries, are still limited. This study will focus on learning effect primarily in advanced manufacturing sectors, typically in aircraft industries, via sub-contracting production. Obviously, inter-organization learning, particularly technology learning along global value chain is the basis of technology innovation [5].

There are numbers of international scholars who did corresponding research on sub-contracting business in aircraft industries. For example, Fernand A., Liliana D. et. al[6] did a qualitative research on possible impact upon those companies as integrators and suppliers in sub-contracting projects in aircraft industries, indicating that there were clear effects upon the two partners, although motives and technical effect from both sides were different. Author [7] of this paper also did survey over typical Chinese companies in aircraft industries during late 1990?s and early 2000?s, on possible modularized collaborations and their effect on technical learning in Chinese aircraft companies in their sub-contracting projects. The research indicates that the sub-contracting mode cannot be matched with typical modularization process, as suppliers of those ?modules? were still controlled heavily by integrators. Therefore, learning through such kind of tightly controlled production procedure, there might be less possible for local Chinese partners to learn advanced production, particularly engineering technologies in the industries. On the other hand, experts from the industries emphasized that the sub-contracting procedure did provide opportunities for local suppliers to upgrade related technologies, however, under internalized integration environment, the most significant nature was on project management side, especially reflected by complex product research mode, multi-layer integrating planning, and project monitoring and team management [8].

Based on these typical research findings by overseas and local scholars in China, in terms of technology learning by suppliers, international sub-contracting projects in aircraft industries can be described as: ? Technology learning (often behaved as organizational  learning) might be non-liner, or not necessarily developed in incremental way;  ? There might be different levels of the learning, each level might be independent to each other, in other word, there might be different types of operation for corresponding technical knowledge learning;  ? There might be both explicit and tacit types of knowledge learning in complex product system sectors, however, learning effects should be highly different based on different types of collaboration.



III. RESEARCH FRAMEWORK:   The survey and the research focus upon engineering technology learning effects in subcontracting production arrangement between overseas subcontractors and the local   2013 Proceedings of PICMET '13: Technology Management for Emerging Technologies.

suppliers in Chinese aviation industry.

We designed a framework in terms of output and process  measures to indicate learning effect of a typical Chinese company in aircraft industries in its continual international sub-contracting business. The output and process measures are designed based on numbers of typical international as well as local studies on complex product and technologies and on international sub-contracting projects, as perceptions by possible respondents with experiences over international sub-contracting projects in aircraft industries. We use Likert scale to reflect correspondents? weighted perceptions on those descriptions in output and process terms over learning effects during such an international sub-contracting project.

Two factors are considered in this study, one as positive factor in learning effect investigation closer collaboration between the overseas integrator and local suppliers, and the other as negative to investigate learning effect of larger knowledge gap between the two parties. We also use overall evaluation consensus or perceptions by all respondents of the questionnaires in this study, as a two folds benchmark, (1) to find which descriptions are considered more fitful to the typical learning effect, and (2) to compare differences under those positive and negative factors.

Based on this framework, we will find in terms of international sub-contracting project in aircraft industries, which kinds of measures are more significant for technology learning than others, among the three kinds of effects, namely, technology learning process, output in overall production quality and economic terms, and output in technical knowledge learning effect. The detailed arrangement for such kind of international sub-contracting project is provided as comparative base for evaluation.

Corresponding research framework can be provided as a flow chart as Figure 1 shown. The learning effect concerned in this study is clearly supported by the background conditions, including typically equipment base and reference materials to indicate explicit technical knowledge, and experience based tacit type of the knowledge involved, and nature of the  training involved in such kind of activities to indicate both explicit and tacit knowledge learning. Learning effect can also be reflected by the nature of collaborative process in such sub-contracting project, including typically information sharing, frequency of communication between the two parties, and more importantly, the commitment for practical solutions by both parties. Output measures in this study are divided into two groups, the one with more direct performance in production quality and economical terms, and the other with more direct performance in knowledge learning and capacity based concerns.

There are four groups of the statements, indicating differences in their nature. International Sub-Contracting Arrangement is to indicate, by correspondents? (also suppliers?) perceptions, importance of the typical arrangement including resources from supplier side, and resources shared between the two parties. Similarly, under ?Process?, importance of typical measures of the performance in this regard is to be evaluated by the correspondents. The two kinds of output performances are in a same sense to clarify which one represents the most importance parts for the benefit from learning.

The detailed descriptions of the three parts (two kinds of outputs and process in collaboration, and operating arrangement for background contrast) are listed in Table 1.

IV. DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS IN THE SURVEY AND  THE EVALUATIONS.

This study investigates a special sample state owned company in Chinese aircraft industries, which has been developing over more than 60 years of successfully manufacturing different types of civil aircrafts in China. This company started collaboration with Boeing since mid 1990?s, manufacturing wings for 737-700 since then. In order to investigate the learning effect through such international sub-contracting deals, we designed and sent 300 questionnaires in mails to technical personnel in that company in March, 2012. Till May, totally 223 completed copies were answered and sent back. However, due to larger numbers of questionnaire with missing answers, finally only 119 copies questionnaires were acceptable for this research.

The basic information from this survey can be summarized as follows: ? Respondents for our questionnaires were from different  types of professional posts, including manufacturing (24.4%), engineering (58.8%), management (9.2%), and others?7.56%??  ? There are stronger positions in terms of human resources in this company, e.g., 74% staff members hold university / college diploma. In terms of more detailed educational background of the respondents, 30.3% from 4 year university background, 40.3% from three year college background, and 3.4% from master degree or above engineering  learning background, and there are also 24.4 % from technical professional school background,  only 1.7% with educational background under high school.

? In terms of methods and collaborative platform for knowledge learning (multi-choice based), ? Direct knowledge transfer through overseas training /  trainers (9.2%); ? Overseas experts on site technical services (12.6%); ? Learning through technical reference materials  (28.5%); ? Learning through practical management and operation  (25.1%); ? Training through local universities (12.6%);.

In total, direct learning (through overseas partners? direct  involvement) accounts for 50.3%, however, primarily through technical reference materials (28.5%).

In the formal questionnaire, in total, 24 statements of learning effect performances are designed and addressed.

Since correspondents are diversified, including not only R&D engineers, but also technical production participants and quality management professionals, these questions are designed as an overall perception based evaluation over those typical learning effect performances, according to correspondents on their different experiences of international sub-contracting projects.

Importance of the statements (representing the four different categories of the performances) are compared firstly, by summarizing weighted scores of all sample respondents (listed in Table 2, the order of this list is based on perception scores within the survey).

Knowledge learning and related innovation is confirmed by the respondents, which indicates that output in technology learning is considered as more important benefit than purely economic returns and quality system improvement;  ? Reference materials and their upgrading are important learning base for the recipient or suppliers, which also indicates that learning is often occurring internally by reading and operating, in this case, reference material is necessary and important;  ? Arrangement for such kind of technical learning base and learning organizations seem important than improvement of management skills.

? Learning effect in output is more significant than output in economic returns.

? However, there is not a larger difference among weighted scores on those 24 statements, according to the consensus of the respondents, which indicates that this overall evaluation can only provide limited conclusions.

Therefore, further detailed comparison may be needed.

V. LEARNING EFFECT UNDER POSITIVE VS.

NEGATIVE FACTORS   Based on overall evaluation of totally 24 performance  choices, it is clear that we need further comparison over perceptions by different groups. In this chapter, we design an investigation under two factor oriented framework.

The first factor is selected as one to represent positive  effective in learning. This factor reflects closer collaborations between integrator and local supplier in aircraft industries.

We choose sample answers with highly confirmation of their collaboration as the group of closer relationship, while we define those with less confirmation of their collaboration as less close relationship group. Theoretical research and empirical studies prove that closer collaboration in technology transfer network can bring positive impact upon network members. This is especially true in complex product sectors, such as in aircraft industries. According to Petroni and Verbano [9], basic feature of space technology transfer process indicates and therefore requires that network is necessary so that availability of technology, availability of information, and availability of contacts between the actors involved can be realized. In the meantime, so called complex product (such as aircraft sectors) as well as complex technologies can also be found that these CoPS and the technologies are available only in self-organized networks[10], or closer collaborative partners. In this regard, we select those respondents to address closer collaborations and separate them from other group of respondents addressing with less closer relationships (their evaluation scores for collaboration are usually less than 3). We compare these two groups of respondents on their judgment on performance evaluations.

In the meantime, we select another measure to reveal functions of negative factors, with more stress on technology gaps or knowledge gap. Similarly, we clarify the two groups by selecting those with higher confirmation of familiarity.

According to numbers of international scholars in technology   2013 Proceedings of PICMET '13: Technology Management for Emerging Technologies.

diffusion and technology transfer fields, the larger the technology gap between technology licensors and licensees, the licensees are more likely to come to failure as either suppliers of the technological resources would not be willing to transfer to actually shorten catching up time and route for recipient, or licensees of the technology would feel difficult to learn. Therefore, we select another group of respondents with positive choice on familiarity (or similarity) of the current knowledge base, if compared with newly involved technologies in sub-contracting projects. In this way, we can divide all respondents into two groups, larger technology gap (weak confirmation on familiarity or similarity, generally less than 3) and smaller technology gap (stronger confirmation on familiarity or similarity, usually larger than 3).

Following table provides detailed comparison of the evaluation scores by two groups of respondents? evaluation scores, being contrasted by overall evaluation on all 24 indicators. The results shown in Table 3 reveal important facts: ? Closer collaboration does provide larger opportunity to  knowledge learning, e.g., shown by typical output performance (including overall and knowledge learning) measures, especially on all process measures. It would be interesting to notice that in international sub-contracting arrangement, hardware based equipment and training organizations seem less sensitive to collaborative  closeness, except only for reference materials and their upgrading. This may be because of more explicit knowledge transfer cases where closeness of collaboration is not as important as in tacit knowledge transfer case.

There are also other items that may not be so relevant to collaborative closeness, e.g., quality system related measures, and management skills. These more detailed differences may also provide interesting implications to those practitioners as well as academic scholars.

? Larger technology gap between partners in international sub-contracting project to some extent does prevent local suppliers from effective learning. This can be reflected through respondent group with more positive confirmation on similarity of the knowledge involved in the sub-contracting projects. In contrast, those correspondents with less confirmation over similarity performance would represent the group with larger technology gap perceptions, and their evaluations on typical measures are significantly different than those respondents in the first group. Interestingly, once again, the most significant differences between larger gap and smaller gap groups are in process measures, while explicit type of knowledge (or codified technical knowledge) in project arrangement category, quality management issues in output measures, and organizational structure issues, appear also less relevant to technology gap measure.

VI. CONCLUSIONS   This paper, by detailed survey over typical Chinese aircraft company in international subcontracting production, emphasizes that for complex product manufacturing sectors such as in aircraft industries, knowledge learning as an organizational learning in global value chain, is increasingly demanding. There are not only tacit but also explicit types of knowledge necessary to the company in the industry. Based on the perceptions of the sample respondents in the survey, knowledge learning is achieved through international sub-contracting operations, and learning effect as organizational output is considered as more important nature than output in economic returns. Meanwhile, a comparative investigation under two factor framework is conducted, while closer collaboration does possess larger explaining power to better knowledge learning, the larger technology gap provides strong evidence to less effective learning. However, in terms of more explicit type of technology resources and other typical output measures, both collaboration and technology gap have limited explaining power on those indicators for output and arrangement issues. This may need further studies for the learning effect.
