Study on the models of cross-chain inventory collaboration in the cluster supply chain

Abstract-Considering the cross-chain inventory collaboration in the cluster supply chain, this paper discussed and comparatively analyzed two models: the one is cross-chain inventory complementarity between enterprises of same tier and the other one is cross-chain inventory complementarity between enterprises of different tiers with the methods of system dynamics simulation. By the analysis of the simulation data, the paper found that using inventory complementarity between enterprises of different tiers can lead to a higher satisfaction rate of customer demand without big changes of inventory and can maintain this large satisfaction rate stably. Therefore, from the perspective of the inventory and customer satisfaction rate, the complementarity model between enterprises of different tiers is superior to the model between enterprises of same tier.

I. NlRODUCTION  With the rapid development of Chinese economy, peoples pay more and more attention to the industry cluster problem which as the important problem in industry development and regional economies development. [1] Clusters represent a kind of new spatial organizational form in between arm's-length markets on the one hand and hierarchies, or vertical integration, on the other.[2] So there exist a lot of parallel single-supply-chains. And the enterprises which in the cluster supply chain not only cooperate with each other in the single supply chain, but also exist cooperation in the cross-chain, which can make the industry cluster suitable to the variability market demand, reduce the searching cost, improve the service level and expand the cognizing of the cluster market[3 -4]. This trend makes the research of supply chain management change to the problem of supply chain of "multi- chains cross-chain Competitive-Cooperation".

On the study of cross-chain inventory of cluster supply chain, Li Jizi et al(2007) have researched one-pipeline inventory collaboration policy (OPICP)in cluster supply chain and dual-pipeline inventory collaboration policy (DPICP)in cluster supply chain (Fig. 1) , but their studies based on the inventory collaboration only occur between enterprises of the same supply chain tier. This study researched the model of cross-chain inventory complementarily between enterprises of different tiers and contrast with the model of cross-chain inventory complementarily between enterprises of same tiers.

II. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION  Suppose the cluster chain is composed of two single supply chains which has three tiers. Each tier has one Producer, one Distributor and one Retailer. The two supply chains deal in same product. Both supply chain 1 (SCI) and supply chain 2 (SC2) adopt fix quantity order method. So the expectation inventory of each enterprise equal to the average selling rate multiply by the maintenance time which the expectation inventory hopes for [5]. The yield of producer, distributor and retailer's order are decided by average fill rate or average selling rate. In the same time, the order modifies the inventory and makes it reaches the expectation inventory.

Otherwise, when one of the supply chains has superfluous stock after filled its consumer demand, it will send products to another. There will have two kinds of models as following:  A. The Model ofCross-chain Inventory Complementarily Between Enterprises ofSame Tier  Because of the uncertain market demand, when the upstream enterprise can't fill the demand of the downstream enterprise, the same tier enterprise of the other supply chain will send products to it, namely cross-chain inventory complementarily between enterprises of same tier (CICBEST) (Fig. 2).

The Model ofCross-ehain bwentory Complementarily Between Enterprises ofDi./ftrent tiers Because of the uncertain market demand, when the  upstream enterprise can't fill the demand of the downstream enterprise, the different tier enterprise of the other supply chain will send products to it, namely cross-chain inventory complementarily between enterprises of different tiers (CICBEDT).(Fig. 3)  SCl  SC2  Fig. 3.

System dynamics simulation model of CICBEST     The DYNAMO equation of inventory of SCI 's retailer: IRl.K = IRl.J +DTX(R~I.J - R:1.J _SRIR2.J +SR2RI.J) (5)  Other into: ~IJ=DELAY1(KjIJ,T;/I) (6)  The DYNAMO equation of the satisfaction rate of SCI's consumer demand:  {  I IF IR1 ~ Fd c1  R C1  = IR1/Fc1 IF IR1 > O} (7) S d IF IR1 < FC1  o IF I R1 :s;; 0 d The DYNAMO equation oftotal inventory:  It = I R1 + I D1 + IF1 + IR2 + I D2 + IF2 (8) The complementarily between producers of different supply  chains and between distributors of different supply chains have the similar DYNAMO equation of the complementarily between retailers. However, the condition of urgency order changes to inventory less than the order of downstream enterprise. When SCI out of stock, its DYNAMO equation is similar to SC2'.

B. The Model of Multi-echelon Cross-chain Inventory Complementarily Between enterprises ofDifferent tiers The system dynamics simulation model is shown in Fig. 5.

In this model, take SC2's retailer out of stock for example:  The DYNAMO equation of the SCI's retailer sending cargos to the SC2's retailer:  Other DYNAMO equations of CICBEST and DYNAMO equations ofCICBEDT are similar.



IV. MODEL ANALYSES  Both of the two models use the software of system dynamic which is named Vensim. This paper takes the total inventory of two supply chains and the customer satisfaction rate as the system's evaluating indicators; Simulation for 100 weeks, a step is 1 week; Both of the two supply chains' customer demand obey the uniform distribution of [100,300]; Each enterprise's initialization inventory is equal to the first fill- rate(or the first selling rate) multiply by the time which the expectation stock can maintain, suppose it was 1.5 weeks; Producer, Distributor and Retailer's inventory adjustment time are supposed 3 weeks, 2 weeks and 1 week. Their lead time is 4 weeks, 2 weeks and 1 week, and the lead time of cross-chain inventory complementarily is zero. Their smooth time is 3 weeks, 2 weeks and 1 week. No matter the model is single inventory strategy or cross-chain inventory strategy, the total inventory curve change tendency has not presented big change after changing customer demand function although they have different extent in the oscillation amplitude. This indicates that the model doesn't confine the parameter very strict, which is advantageous to the model when it is used in practice. [6] The result ofthe model simulation is shown in table I .

Form the table we can conclude that if the cross-chain inventory collaboration model adopts same enterprise complementarity strategy, SC 1 and SC2' s customer satisfaction rate (SCI's CSR&SC2's CSR, Fig. 6-2 &6-3) respectively raised 7 and 5 percentage points compared with the single model. However, what they should pay for is their quantity of inventory raised 402 units and 219 units, the total inventory (Fig. 6-1) is raised 621 units and the dispersion also  Customer2 Demand Function  Producer2 Production ~- DelayTime ~  ~ Producer2 ~ Goods  Producer 2 Received Rate Productivity ---- ...--'L...-....,..---------'\ Producer 2  Fill Rate  oducer2lnvent~cer2 vefOry Producer2 Ex ctatlon stmentRate AdJustmen TI e f'  InventoryMalntena ceTlme~ ~ \ ~  Producer2 \ ~ etaller2 ventory Re~~II~~~~":t~age Expectation Inventory .

Meanwhile the dispersion of total inventory dropped 58.73. The respective dispersion of customer satisfaction rate is 0.31 and 0.33, which are the lowest in all models above. This indicates that the customer satisfaction rate of cross-chain inventory complementarily between enterprises of different tiers is the most stable.

Supp ly chain 2  v. CONCLUSIONS According to the analysis described above, while the model  of multi-echelon cross-chain inventory complementarily between enterprises of same tier improves the customer satisfaction rate, which actually depend on increasing the total inventory of industry cluster. The high stock fluctuation will increase the inventory management difficulty and lead to high level inventory and inventory holding cost. So this inventory collaboration method to the economic value of industry cluster is not very great. However, the method of multi-echelon cross- chain inventory complementarily between enterprises of different tiers can enhance the customer satisfaction rate under the condition of the inventory changing little. Otherwise, the dispersion of customer satisfaction rate respective is the lowest in the above models, this finding suggests that the customer satisfaction rate is the most stable. This tendency also occurs in the total inventory of industry cluster.

When the cross-chain inventory complementarily between enterprises of different tiers, SCI and SC2's quantity of inventory raised 55 units and 57units respectively compared with the single chain model, the total inventory have reached 2046 units which is far less than cross-chain inventory collaboration model adopted enterprises of the same tier complementarily strategy, even if it raised 112 units compared to the single chain model.
