Mining for Implications in Medical Data

Abstract  Accruing patients for clinical trials has been a tedious and time consuming task for clinicians. It requires ex- tensive knowledge of the specific criteria for all available clinical trials. Through interviews with clinicians, implica- tions were discovered which reduced the number of required questions/answers to determine eligibility. After gathering and recording data on past breast cancer patients, the an- swers to the questions asked by an expert system were ex- tracted. An association rule learner, was used to generate implication rules such as: male => not pregnant. It was determined that all current implication rules could be re- covered with 100% confidence. Further searching for addi- tional rules resulted in the discovery of several which pro- vided an improvement in the clinical ease of use of the web- based Clinical Trial Assignment Expert System.

1 Introduction  Cancer is a disease that can affect people from all walks of life. The focus of this research was on identifying pa- tients eligible for breast cancer clinical trials. In 2004 it was estimated that there will be 215,990 new female and 1,450 new male cases of invasive breast cancer diagnosed [2]. Ad- ditionally, it is estimated that there will be another 59,390 cases of in situ breast cancer [2]. In 2004, it is expected that 40,110 women and 470 men will die from this disease [2]. Therefore, it is important to match patients to clinical trials so that new treatments can be adequately evaluated in a timely manner.

Clinical trials provide a method for evaluating the effec- tiveness and safety of new cancer treatments on human sub- jects. A continual problem is obtaining adequate partici- pation to sufficiently test these treatments. Enrollment in clinical trials is a time consuming and tedious process for clinicians. It requires them to have extensive knowledge of  the protocol treatment(s) and the inclusion/exclusion crite- ria for participation. The clinician must match this infor- mation with their current patient base to determine if there are any matches. Currently, the matching process is per- formed manually by clinicians. Studies have indicated that up to 60% of eligible patients do not participate in clinical trials, which in turn leads to significant delays in the evalu- ation and possible approval of new beneficial treatments for diseases [5, 6, 7, 8].

We have developed a web-based expert system to match eligible patients with open clinical trials, or if the patient was eligible and not put onto the trial, categorize the reasons [4]. It has been used on historical data. The system allows for testing against all available clinical trials or a subset of them at a time. It is necessary to precisely follow the word- ing of inclusion/exclusion criteria when creating questions.

This results in multiple, slightly different, questions which ask for the same type of information. Further, a physician will immediately know the answers to some questions based on answers to others. That is, there is a clear implication that always holds. However, the people entering the proto- cols may or may not know this. A busy clinical practitioner will not be willing to answer redundant questions and hence will not use a system that asks them. So, it is of paramount importance to develop implication rules which assert all an- swers implied by any given answer. For example, once we know the sex is male no question about pregnancy should appear on a displayed page of questions. Once a question about biopsy results is answered, there should be no ques- tion about whether they have ever had any type of surgery.

There have been other systems developed to help in- crease accrual to clinical trials. These and our own research results have indicated that a significant increase in accrual is possible [3, 4, 9]. However, to get a system fielded in the clinic it must be extremely easy and quick to use. It should request no extraneous information. This paper dis- cusses improving usability of such a system over time by applying association rule mining to data that is acquired  0-7695-2521-0/06 $20.00  ? 2006    through the initial use of our clinical trial assignment ex- pert system at the Moffitt Cancer Center at the University of South Florida. We have used a tool based on the Apri- ori algorithm [1] to show that it is possible to recover what we call implication rules that were obtained from experts, as well as some unknown (to us) implication rules. These implication rules allow facts to be asserted when a related question is answered and allow decisions to be made with less data entry which is extremely important to enable clin- ical use.

2 Patient Data Collection  Data was collected for 135 past breast cancer patients treated at the Moffitt Cancer Center. Data mining tech- niques were applied to a database of 135 patients in one set of experiments and 100 patients in a second set of ex- periments. The use of the reduced database for the second set of experiments was due to version changes of the expert system and changes in the open clinical trial protocols at the time of these experiments. The initial page of questions is shown in Figure 2.

2.1 Data Extraction  Patient data for the 135 patients entered into the system was extracted from the Clinical Trial Assignment expert system database and consolidated into a single file. For each patient a different number of questions could be answered.

Maybe 1 question would rule them out or the answers to 30 would show eligibility, for example. There were 299 ques- tions but 46 required continuous values and were ignored  Figure 2. Screenshot of Initial Questions page for the Clinical Trial Assignment Sys- tem.

because our association rule mining tool, like most, did not accept continuous values. So, each patient feature vector consisted of answers to between 1 and 253 questions.

3 Data Mining Experiments  The experiments were done with the Apriori and Apriori Rules software (http://www.adrem.ua.ac.be/?goethals/software/). We used two experimental data sets.

For completeness we provide some definitions. For a given set of transactions, where each transaction is a set of items, an association rule is an expression XY, where X and Y are subsets of items and I is the set of all items. Usually expressed as X ? Y, where X ? I, Y ? I, and X ? Y = ? [1].

An association rule has a minimum support. Rule X ? Y has support s in a transaction set D if s% of transactions in D contain X ? Y [1]. It also has a confidence. The rule X ? Y holds in the transaction set D with confidence c if c% of transactions in D that contain X also contain Y [1].

The goal is to generate all the association rules found within the dataset that are greater than or equal to the minimum support and confidence values.

0-7695-2521-0/06 $20.00  ? 2006    3.1 Data Set One  In the first experiment, 135 patient records each with a possible 253 dimensions were processed through the Apri- ori software. Since the implications we search for always hold, a confidence value of 1 is required. The lower the minimum support value the more rules to sift. In our case, we were searching for known implications which we hy- pothesized would occur frequently (high support).

For the purpose of this experiment a minimum support value of 88 and a confidence value of 1 which is equivalent to 100% confidence was used. This produced 15 association rules. It was determined that this was not sufficient for the purposes of this investigation because none of the original implication rules were recovered and of the 15 association rules found, none were considered meaningful.

The minimum support value was lowered to 85 result- ing in 114 new association rules. From this experiment two meaningful rules were discovered; however none of the original implication rules were recovered. Next, a min- imum support of 70 and a confidence level of 100% was used. This resulted in 1812 new association rules. Most of the rules generated were permutations on the earlier rules discovered; however from the results we were able to lo- cate 83 rules of interest. Of these 83 association rules dis- covered, 16 of these rules were of particular interest and required further investigation. Of the 16 new rules discov- ered, it was determined that four of these rules should be potentially added back into the expert system as new im- plications, a nice result. However, we still did not find the existing clinician generated implication rules. The newly discovered rules were:  1. If the patient has had surgery for breast can- cer, what was the most extensive type? - Breast sparing procedure or lumpectomy ? Has the patient had surgery for breast cancer? - Yes (This combination occurred 79 times out of 135 records)  2. What is the estrogen receptor status? - Positive ? Has the patient had surgery for breast cancer? - Yes (This combination occurred 80 times out of 135 records)  3. What is the progesterone receptor status? - Positive ? Has the patient had surgery for breast cancer? - Yes (This combination occurred 70 times out of 135 records)  4. Did the surgery include an axillary dissection? - Yes ? Has the patient had surgery for breast cancer? - Yes (This combination occurred 116 times out of 135 pa- tient records)  It was apparent that Rules one (1) and four (4) should be included as additions to the implication set in the current knowledge base. It was not clear to us whether Rules two (2) and three (3) were valid. A clinical expert was consulted and determined these implications were correct. When a pa- tient is determined to have either a positive estrogen and/or progesterone status then breast cancer surgery would have occurred.

3.2 Data Set Two  We noticed that there had been some significant changes in the clinical trial protocols that were open during data col- lection. So, we chose the most recent 100 patients? data and focused just upon the two protocols for which we had 4 clinician generated implication rules. We used just a subset of patients that were ineligible for each of the two protocols for two reasons. One, it was expected that implication rules that existed would be used in these cases to quickly rule out the patients and we believed that it might be possible to find some new implications to quickly determine patients were not eligible.

Each protocol was processed independently using Apri- ori with a minimum support value of ten and a confidence level of 100%.

First, all 100 ineligible patients for the first of the two protocols analyzed were used. There were 831 rules that were discovered which included three of the four current system implications. From this set of rules, there were ten additional rules of interest that required further investiga- tion to verify their medical validity, but just one was found valid by our clinical experts. The current system implica- tions recovered from the first run of this experiment were as follows: 1.) Did the surgery include an axillary dissection? No => Was an axillary dissection performed? No (This combination occurred 14 times out of 100 records.) 2.) Was an axillary dissection performed? Yes => Did the surgery include an axillary dissection? Yes (This combination occurred 71 times out of 100 records.

The reverse implication also held.)  New rule: If the patient was administered therapy for cancer, what types were used? Chemotherapy => Has the patient signed an informed consent? Yes (This combination occurred 36 times out of 100 records.)  In the second experiment, only the 85 patients deter- mined ineligible for the second of the two protocols ana- lyzed were used. There were 487 rules discovered which in- cluded one of the current system implications. There were an additional 13 new rules of interest that would require further investigation to establish medical validity. The last current implication rule was recovered:  Has the patient been administered any therapy for can-  0-7695-2521-0/06 $20.00  ? 2006    cer? No => Has the patient received a total dose of doxorubicin or daunorubicin of greater than 450 mg/m?2? No (This combination occurred 53 times out of 100 records.)  Three of the thirteen additional rules discovered were verified to be valid (by the clinicians in our acknowledg- ments) in all situations and should be considered for ad- dition to the Clinical Trial Assignment expert system. An example is: If the patient was administered therapy for can- cer, what types were used? Chemotherapy => Has the patient been administered any therapy for can- cer? Yes (This combination occurred 49 times out of 100 records.)  From these results, it appears that in future experiments; current implications can be recovered using the same meth- ods. Additionally, this experiment clearly verifies that we received good information from interviews with clinicians.

4 Conclusions  Research has shown that clinicians are reluctant to use automated clinical trial selection systems due to time con- straints; therefore it was the goal of this research to attempt to discover new implications within the knowledge base that would reduce the number of questions required to be an- swered by clinicians. By reducing the number of questions it is our hope that the system will become easier to use and will encourage clinicians to actively utilize the system as a tool for matching patients to currently available clinical trials. The system described was focused on breast cancer trials, but has been adapted for different cancer types.

The result of this research is that eight (8) additional as- sociation rules or implications were discovered. These rules have been verified as correct by a clinical expert. The newly discovered rules have been added to the Clinical Trial As- signment Expert System to improve clinical ease of use, system efficiency, and accuracy.

Another goal of this research was to verify that all the current implications are valid with 100% confidence. This was done by looking at ineligible cases. All system impli- cations being used in the currently open clinical trial proto- cols were recovered, which provides support to the use of data mining techniques to determine new association rules.

All new implications should be verified with a clinical ex- pert to determine the medical validity of the implication as was done here. As shown in the Experiments section, there are many associations that can be derived from the use of the association rule learning tool, Apriori. However, very few of those implications are medically verifiable and accu- rate. Even with a confidence of one there are many potential rules to sift, which is an issue. There will always be a need to discuss potential new rules with a medical expert before adding these implications into the expert system.
