Abstract: Mining association rules in large relational databases containing both quantitative and categorical attributes is important.

The article proposes an approach for mining quantitative association rules. It gives the definition of the cloud model association rules  and also presents an efficient algorithm Cloud Model A, and presents an application in prediction.

Keywords: KDD, data mining, cloud model association rule, prediction  -  0-7803-7268-9/01/$10.00 0 2 0 0 1  IEEE.
