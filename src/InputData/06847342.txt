A Study on Independent Object-Relationship  Derivation Technique based on Object Extraction

Abstract? Despite increasing demands for big data  application based on the analysis of scattered unstructured data, few relevant studies have been reported. Accordingly, the present study suggests a technique enabling a sentence-based semantic analysis by extracting objects from collected web information and automatically analyzing the relationships between such objects with collective intelligence and language processing technology. To be specific, collected information is stored in DBMS in a structured form, and then morpheme and feature information is analyzed. Obtained morphemes are classified into objects of interest, marginal objects and objects of non-interest.

Then, with an inter-object attribute recognition technique, the relationships between objects are analyzed in terms of the degree, scope and nature of such relationships. As a result, the analysis of relevance between the information was based on certain keywords and used an inter-object relationship extraction technique that can determine positivity and negativity. Also, the present study suggested a method to design a system fit for real- time large-capacity processing and applicable to high value- added services.

I.  INTRODUCTION Claiming to stand for openness and sharing, online space of  Web 2.0 sees so much knowledge and information scattered and countless web users? thoughts or feelings present in the form of texts and images. Thus, lots of studies have dealt with ?text mining? by analyzing texts about certain themes (products) mainly for corporate marketing. Yet, conventional ?text mining? techniques rely on simple quantitative analysis of a single theme. In this context, the present study aims to develop a technique that regularly collects structured and unstructured information scattered in web environment in refined forms, extracts objects of interest and marginal objects from the collected information and automatically analyzes the ?nature and degree? of inter-object relationships through collective intelligence and language processing technology.

With this technique, the degree, scope and nature of relationships can be analyzed between the objects of interest and marginal objects beyond the conventional ?text mining.?

II. RELEVANT STUDIESSELECTING A TEMPLATE Depending on the extent to which data are structured, there  are structured, semi-structured and unstructured data. The difference between these data types lies in whether they are saved in a fixed field or not. The semi-structured data   are not saved in a fixed field as the unstructured data, referring to data including metadata or schema information [2] [4]. The present study uses a text mining technique to analyze the data collected on the internet [3]. The problem with the conventional text mining involving discovering useful information in structured texts is that nothing but the structured database can be used [5].

This article concerns an opinion mining analysis for the purpose of deriving inter-object relationships, which are the core concept of this study, using words and sentences sorted out by an interoperable text mining technique [1].



III. OBJECT-RELATIONSHIP DERIVATION TECHNIQUE To derive the inter-object relationships, information on the  internet is selectively collected and saved in a database in a structured form. The collected information is analyzed in terms of morphemes and features. The obtained morphemes go through an object extractor and are classified into objects of interest, marginal objects and objects of non-interest. Then, an inter-object feature recognizer is used to identify the degree, scope and nature of inter-object relationships. ?Fig.1? shows the data analysis process.

Fig. 1. A reference model for data analysis     This article describes the information analyzer, object extractor and feature recognizer. As this study aims to extract objects, it should be possible to analyze the feature information of each morpheme in addition to simple parts-of-speech information. To be specific, the ?object extractor? extracts the detailed feature information of each morpheme. The ?object extractor? in this study is designed to extract the human name objects using name-related probability and statistics and also to search structured patterns including resident registration numbers, phone numbers and dates using regular expressions.

Such information as resident registration numbers, phone numbers, dates and emails can be represented by the following regular expressions. Here, whether a string corresponding to a certain item matches the regular expression pattern is checked before all necessary objects are searched and extracted. The regular expressions below can determine whether a text pattern as well as a word or phrase matches or not.

TABLE I.  REGULAR EXPRESSION PER ITEM  Item Regular expressions  Email [0-9a-y]([-_.]?[0-9aa])*@[0-9a-y]([-_.]?[0-9a-y])*.[a-y]{2,3}  Resident registration number [0-9]{6}-[1-4][0-9]{6}  Phone number ([0-9]{2,4}-[0-9]{3,4}-[0-9]{3,4}[^0-9])|([^0-9][0-9]{3,4}-[0-9]{3,4})  Date format: YYYY-MM-DD YYYY/MM/DD  [12][0-9]{3}(-|/)(0[1-9]|1[012])(-|/)(0[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[0- 1])  ?  Date format: 2004/11/22 05:32:56  [0-9]{4}(-|/|\.)[0-9]{2}(-|/|\.)[0-9]{2} +[0-9]{1,2}:[0-9]{1,2}:[0- 9]{1,2}    The co-occurrence frequency indicates the extent to which two objects are related with each other, which is called the ?degree of relationship.? Based on the co-occurrence frequency information between ?objects? extracted by the object extractor, the relevance between ?objects? is analyzed. Here, to correct any unconditional measurement of simply frequent words as having a high relevance, PMI (Point-wise Mutual Information) is used in calculating the relevance. The higher the PMI, the higher the relevance. Likewise, the lower the PMI, the lower the relevance. The PMI-based relevance points to just high or low relationships without indicating the good or bad nature of such relationships. To characterize the relevance in addition to determining the degree of relevance, the positivity or negativity of the sentences where objects co-occur is analyzed. Then, the positive and negative relationships between objects are matched.



IV. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION To verify the ?object-relationship derivation technique,?  information collected from multiple SNS was organized in a certain pattern and saved in MongoDB. The data constituting the main table were collected for about a month. The total number of data collected was approximately 220,000 items.

The collected SNS data underwent the information analysis and the object extraction, where top 30 objects were extracted from the 220,000 keywords. As such, from the SNS information  collected based on a total of 7 keywords, new objects were extracted. The inter-object relationships of the entire objects derived were quantified as below.

Fig. 2. Inter-object relationships based on experiment results (including positive and negative relationships)  The present article proposed an object-relationship derivation technique capable of determining the positivity and negativity beyond the conventional text mining, so as to find the relevance between information analyzed based on certain keywords. Also, this study designed a system fit for real-time large-capacity processing and maximized its efficiency and practicality to the extent that it is applicable to high value- added services.
