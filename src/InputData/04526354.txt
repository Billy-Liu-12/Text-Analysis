Design of an Adaptive Communication System for Implementation on Board a Future Algerian LEO Satellite

Abstract Understanding of the physical communications environment from low Earth orbits is the key to the successful implementation of the communications system.

This already complex environment is further complicated by the constraints of the microsatellite platform. The small, low mass platform offers limited downlink power and a small antenna envelope and ground plane. This affects the performance of both uplink and downlink in the fading LEO environment. The 'little LEO' satellite systems must be designed to operate in the presence of this environment.

The concept of adaptivity is of paramount importance in the design of future LEO satellite communication systems, in which a careful exploitation of the limited available resources (bandwidth, power, etc.) is required. An adaptive system, that can increase the rate of data transmission is desired. This system should be capable of changing its rate in response to the current signal conditions.
